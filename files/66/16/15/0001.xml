naval SITUATION.Tripoli has been bombarded by the Mediterranean Fleet, v;There have been no losses in Atlantic convoys and shipping losses generally are lower.Home Waters.2. E-Boats attacked a coastal convoy oh South wold on the 17th April and sank two ships and damaged a third. The E-Boats were engaged and one was hit but escaped in the mist.M.T.Bs. carried out offensive sweeps off the Flanders coast during the nightthe 17th/18th, but without result.The Free French submarine Minerve obtained one certain and one probablehit on a large tanker off the S.W. coast of Norway on the 21st, and suffered some damage herself.The German battle-cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau have been at Brestthroughout the week, and have been repeatedly attacked by the R.A.F. as detailedin the Air Section of this Resume.During an air raid on Portsmouth during the night the 17th/18th three orfour bombs fell in the Dockyard causing minor damage. Admiralty Housereceived a direct hit, and there were 6 killed and 60 wounded in R.N. barracks.There was further damage on the night the 23rd/24th.Heavy air raids on Plymouth on the nights of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd causedsevere damage and casualties in the Dockyard and Naval establishments, especiallyin the South Yard and in the Naval and Marine Barracks. H.M. DestroyerLewes was also damaged.H.M. Trawler Basset destroyed an enemy aircraft off Harwich on the 20thand damaged another.The 10th Canadian troop Convoy arrived safely in the Clyde on the19th April.Atlantic.3.   H.M.S. Resolution has arrived in Philadelphia Navy Yard for refitting.During the week ten French merchant vessels eastbound and nine westboundhave passed Gibraltar, all under escort.FI.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Bulolo intercepted the French ShipFort de France 500 miles W. of the Canaries on the 19th April, and is sendingher in to Gibraltar under armed guard.Mediterranean.4. The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, in H.M.S. Warspite, with .M. Ships Barham, Valiant, Malaya and Gloucester, accompanied by destroyers,bombarded the port and shipping at Tripoli for 42 minutes at dawn on the21st April; the Naval bombardment was preceded by bombing and flare droppingby R.A.F. and naval aircraft. Air spotting was rendered difficult by smoke anddust from the air attack, but three or four ships were set on fire or sunk in thenaval basin and two or more others hit as well as a destroyer; the harbourfacilities and shore establishments were also seriously damaged, some 530 tons ofshells having been fired. No naval units were encountered and there was no reply from the shore batteries for 20 minutes. There was no damage or casualties toour ships. During the approach naval aircraft shot down four troop-carryingaircraft and one bomber, and after the bombardment destroyed one bomber anddefeated an attack by dive-bombers, one of which was shot down and one probably destroyed.Malta was attacked by enemy aircraft on the nights of the 19th, 20th and21st, and damage was done to the Dockyard and small craft.Enemy aircraft made frequent bombing and minelaying raids on Tobruk andthe Libyan coast during the period the 18th to the 22nd April; H.M. Destioy&apos;-rGreyhound was damaged and two merchant ships and H.M.S. Fiona- (OceanBoarding Vessel) were sunk by bombs.
A large troop convoy has arrived safely at Suez from the United Kingdom.The Greek destroyer Hydra has been sunk at Piraeus, and the DestroyerPsara and a hospital ship damaged by enemy aircraft. The Greek hospital shipHesperos was bombed and sunk in the Gulf of Patras and another damaged offMegara.Units of the Greek Navy have joined the Mediterranean Fleet at Alexandria.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. Two attacks on U-Boats have been reported during the week, one by aircraft and one by a trawler, both in the N.W. Approaches; no visible results were observed.Enemy Intelligence.German.6. At the beginning of the week photographic air reconnaissance locatedthe following main units : Kiel, one Pocket Battleship in dry dock, one Hipperclass cruiser in floating dock, one Schlesien class battleship in floating dock.Bremen, Seydlitz completing. Wilhemshaven, one Schlesien class battleship in:dry dock. Brest, both battle cruisers present, one in dry dock and the otheralongside the Torpedo Boat Station. Air photographs of Brest on the 23rd Aprilshowed that nets have been spread over the space between the sides of the battle-cruiser and the walls of the dock in which she is lying.There was a report that the battleship Bismarck, two cruisers of the LeipzigClass and three destroyers passed the Skaw early on the 14th April steering North-West. On the morning of the 22nd April, a Sunderland aircraft reported sight-,ing one battleship, two cruisers and two destroyers at Narvik, and these maywell be those reported passing the Skaw on the 14th April. The composition ofthis force is not now thought to include a battleship of the Bismarck class, both ofwhich are believed to be still in the Baltic.Italian.7. Owing to lack of reconnaissance flights the positions of main units ofthe Italian Fleet are obscure, but on the 19th April photographs of Tarantoshowed no battleship present. In the outer harbour were two cruisers and in the inner harbour were one cruiser, three destroyers and three submarines. TheLittorio, therefore, must have left Taranto on completion of repairs to damageincurred during the Taranto raid by naval aircraft.The battleship Vittorio Veneto, damaged during the battle of Cape Matapan.is thought to have gone to Taranto only for a few hours. Her present where-abouts are unknown.U-Boats.8. It is not considered that the U-Boat forces in the North-western approaches have been reduced to any extent, though activity has been slight.During the week there have been some fourteen German and four or fiveItalian U-Boats in the North-Western Approaches. These have been operatingbetween 52c N. to 63c N. and 12c W. to 27c W. One German has been patrollingoff Brest and three others between Madeira and the Canaries and Madeira andthe Cape Verde Islands; two of these were probably homeward bound towards theend of the week. One may still be off Brazil in the Pernambuco-Bahia area. Twohave been patrolling off Freetown. Three Italian U-Boats have been patrollingbetween Portugal, the Azores and Madeira.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. According to the information at present available the merchant shipping losses during the week ended noon, Wednesday, the 23rd April, amounted to11 ships and a tug (46,230 tons), of which 6 ships and the tug (34,227 tons) were british.   Three shiplTwere sunk by U-Boat, one in the North Atlantic, one in[22450] b
the Freetown area and one off Crete. Four ships were sunk by aircraft in theMediterranean and one in the Medway. One ship was mined off the East coast and a tug in the Thames.   Two ships were sunk by E-Boat off the East Coast.There have been seven attacks by aircraft on coastal convoys during the week,all unsuccessful, and two attacks on the 18th April on a convoy in theN.W. Approaches by Focke-Wulf aircraft, which was driven off.Details are given in Appendix I of losses and damage to ships of whichaccurate information has now come to hand. These losses total 19 ships sunk(73,398 tons), of which 5 ships (9,070 tons) form part of the casualties given inthe paragraph above. Of the remaining earlier losses 6 ships (31,161 tons) were sunk by U-Boat, 4 ships (13,525 tons) by aircraft, three ships (12,611 tons) by mine and one (7,031 tons) by surface craft. In addition details are given of22 ships which have been damaged.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ended noon, the 23rd April, 938 ships, including168 allied and 25 neutral, were convoyed. Three battleships, 5 cruisers, 8 armed merchant cruisers, 4 submarines, 68 destroyers and 62 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties. Since the beginning of the war 61,167 ships havebeen convoyed, of which 299 have been lost by enemy action; a ratio of 1 in 204.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the19th April totalled 756,472 tons, compared with 376,437 tons during the previousweek and an average of 661,645 tons for the past ten weeks. Oil imports were247,061 tons in 23 tankers compared with 102,706 tons in nine tankers duringthe week ending the 5th April. Mineral imports were 131,196 tons, of which86,467 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. The corresponding figures for the previous week were 99,230 tons and 91,267 tons. Timber importsshowed an increase of 26,662 tons from 21,531 tons to 48,193. Cereal imports were well above average, totalling 167,207 tons. Twenty ships were fully ladenwith grain. Other food imports were also satisfactory, being 73,810 tons, of whichmeat totalled 18,181 tons, fruit 3,316 tons, cocoa 6,789 tons, sugar 9,771 tonsand tea 4,063 tons. There were 392 tons of rum from Demerara and 629 tonsof tobacco. There were also satisfactory imports of machinery . (including2.391 tons of machine tools), ammunition, aircraft and aircraft engines.British Minelaying. .11. On the 18th April, H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 270 mines in the East coast barrier. On the 19th April, H.M.S. Plover laid 120 mines in St. George&apos;s channel and the same number again on the 21st April. On the latter day the20th Destroyer Flotilla laid 96 mines off the Isle de Bas. M.T.B.&apos;s laid 8 minesoff Dunkirk on both the 17th and 22nd April..Aircraft have laid mines off Brest and off the German North Sea Coast. -Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.12. Mines were dropped in the Thames during raids on London. Most ofthe mines were seen and marked as they fell and the river was only closed for ashort period after each raid. Different sections were reopened in turn and shipping has been very little held up. Six mines were dropped in different docksbesides those in the stream.Minelaying aircraft have also operated over the Thames Estuary, includingHarwich, off the East Coast to as far north as Yarmouth and off Milford Havenand Liverpool Bay.Nine magnetic mines have been detonated during the week and threeacoustic. During clearance operations in the portion of the Falmouth contactminefield, six mines have been cut or exploded in sweeps, and cutters have alsobeen found. Mine totals are now as follows : magnetic 1,077, acoustic 514,contact 858.The enemy has laid mines off Mersa-Tobruk, for which dangerous areas havebeen declared.
Enemy Merchant Shipping. .. ,German.    &apos; &apos; : &apos;, 13. During the week a number of successful attacks on enemy merchantshipping have been claimed, and the estimated tonnage sunk or seriously damaged in Northern Waters may be put at about 55,000 tons. These successes are dueto submarines and aircraft, possible casualties from mining are not taken intoconsideration.Two ships, each of about 2,000 tons, laden with food passed Istanbul on the16th April bound for Salonika.Italian. ,14. The Conte di Savoia, 48,502 tons, and the Vulcania, 24,469 tons, were reported to be at Genoa on the 1st April, with four or five other ships of about10,000 tons each.The Silvio Tripcovitch, 2,365 tons, is reported to have been sunk with considerable loss of life in the middle of March.The hospital ship Arno, 8,024 tons, was expected to arrive at Naples early on the 2nd April with 450 patients. Another hospital ship, the Sicilia, 9,648 tons,sent a message to Bari stating that she was arriving there or the 18th April with781 hospital cases. :.A report has been received that the Mexican Government have taken overthe Italian tankers Tuscania, 6,904 tons, and Giorgio Fassio, 6,735 tons,, whichare at Tampico and Vera Cruz respectively, and will use them for local trade between Mexico and Houston.It has been reported from Montevideo, Uruguay, that the Government willrequisition the two Italian ships Adamello, 5,785 tons, and j,&apos;?e Fausto, 5,263 tons.The only German ship there has already been requisitioneu.MILITARY SITUATION.The Balkan Operations.Greece.15. After the collapse of Yugoslavia on the 15th April, Greek and british forces had to meet the additional threat of a German drive southwards throughthe Monastir Gap. Our troops therefore held a general line, Mount Olympuswestwards along the Aliakmon river, while Greek forces began to withdraw fromthe northern sectors of the Albanian front.16. On the 17th April German armoured and mountain troops wereadvancing each side of Mount Olympus, whence the line ran north-west to Serbiaand then followed roughly the line of the River Aliakhmon to Vatokhorion, some15 miles S.W. of florina. Progress was made by armoured and mountain troopsin the Vale of Tempe (S.E. of Mount Olympus), and further west armoured forcescrossed the River Venetinos south of Grevena, but made only slow progress.17. It was evident that the German object was to gain the plain of Thessalyand so drive a wedge between the British and Greek forces, and cut the latteroff from any possible line of withdrawal.18. By the evening of the 19th April, German armoured forces operating on both sides of Mount Olympus had gained the eastern half of the plain ofThessaly and had advanced southwards beyond Larissa. At the same timeGerman armoured forces had reached Trikkala, at the extreme north-western endof the plain, whilst the rest of the German line remained unchanged.
19. The most decisive German effort seems to have been made on the20th April. Those forces which had already on the day before reached the plainof Thessaly advanced on Lamia, whilst German motorised forces struck acrossthe Pindus Mountains from Grevena and reached the Yannina area. At the sametime, the roads of withdrawal of the Imperial and Greek forces were attacked by dive-bombers with fighter escort, whilst similar attacks were made on the harbour of Piraeus..... 20. The withdrawal of our forces to the Thermopylae position was success-fully completed on the 21st April after a series of rearguard actions.21. On the 21st and 22nd April very little advance was made by the german forces, who were consolidating the ground gained in preparation for an attack in the Thermopylae area. Bombing of Piraeus continued, and bombing attacks were also made on Patras and on allied aerodromes in the Athens area. By the evening of fhe 22nd April the German line was believed to be approximatelyVolos-Lamia-Yannina.22. The islands of Thasos and Samothrace, situated off the coast of WesternThrace, have been occupied by small German forces, who experienced no resistance.Bulgaria.23. Call-up of reservists is continuing, though Bulgarian units are alreadybelieved to be at 75 per cent, strength and further increase will be difficult.24. According to the reported terms of a military convention signed earlythis month between the Bulgarian War Minister and Field-Marshal Von Brau-chitsch, the whole of the Bulgarian Army will be concentrated on the Turkishfrontier. Arrangements for Bulgarian troops to hold captured Greek territory in Thrace and Macedonia have been continued, and the German radio states thatthe Turkish Government was officially informed of their entry on the 19th April.Turkey.25. Reports speak variously of a projected attack on Turkey and of thepossibility of a non-aggression pact. One report mentions that German militarycircles are much interested in an attack towards the Suez Canal through asia minor. Meanwhile, Von Papen has left for Berlin and is not expected to returnfor a fortnight. Proposals of some kind will doubtless be made on his return,the Turks by then having had time to appreciate the fate of Yugoslavia.Morocco.26. Recent reports show that the French are quite incapable of resistingGerman infiltration, and that at the same time they are apprehensive of attacksfrom Spanish Morocco and Libya should the German campaign in Egypt be successful.Iraq.27. On the 17th April, 150 men, the first flight of an airborne british infantry Battalion from India, were landed at Shaibah.On the 18th April, an Indian Brigade Group was landed at Basra.Spain.28. There have been a large number of reports to the effect that Germany ispressing Spain to join the Tripartite Pact and to give passage to German troops for an attack on Gibraltar. Reports of troop movements on the Franco-Spanishfrontier have now been contradicted and a report that Suner had gone to Berlinwas shown to be untrue.29. Arrangements for the billeting of German tourists in Southern spain and a recent visit by German generals to the vicinity of Gibraltar are further
evidence that the Germans are making every preparation for an attack on theWestern gate to the Mediterranean, which according to some sources, is to besynchronised with an attack on Egypt.Africa.Libya.30. The enemy drive Eastwards in Libya has halted in the areaSollum-Capuzzo, and reports indicate that the German forces have taken updefensive positions both there and around Tobruk. At the moment the enemyappears to be having difficulties with the supply and maintenance of his forcesin the forward area, and there is evidence that transport aircraft are being usedto supplement the normal supply services.31. There are reports that the German forces in Libya are being reinforcedand also that they intend to seize Kufra and thence advance against SouthernEgypt and the Sudan.32. The Garrison of Tobruk continues to repel enemy attacks and to carryout offensive sorties. On the 17th April, twelve enemy tanks penetrated the perimeter. The infantry, however, failed to follow up the tanks, four of whichwere destroyed. On the night 21st/22nd April, three raids were carried out on enemy positions opposite the West and South-West Sectors of the defences.Four hundred and forty-six prisoners were captured, mostly Italians, including16 officers. Our own casualties in these operations were light. One light tankwas lost.33. Our force operating in the Sollum-Sofafi area has also carried outactive patrolling operations including a successful raid on an enemy force inSollum on the night of 15th/16th April.34. On the night of the 19th/20th April a landing operation by 450 special service personnel was carried out at Bardia, without opposition. A tyre dumpand a bridge were destroyed and some coast defence guns were rendered unusable.Five Officers and 62 O.Rs. failed to re-embark and were evidently captured.35. On the 21st April reinforcements, which included one Army FieldRegiment, one Heavy and one Light A.A. Regiment, the Roj^al Marine Group ofthe Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation, arrived in Suez on the 21st April.A abyssinia.36. Our columns operating from the north have cOme into contact with theenemy north of Gondar and near Amba Alagi.37. Our troops fanning out from Addis Ababa in pursuit of the enemy are-operating in three directions. To the north, they are in touch with the enemyjust south of Dessye; to the south, contact has been made near Sciasciamana,about 100 miles south of Adama; and to the south-west a stand has been madeby Italian forces retiring on Jimma at the Omo crossing, 100 miles S.W. of addis ababa.38. The advance from Kenya continues and our troops have occupied Maji;further east they are in touch with Italian forces in the areas of Uadara andAlghe.AIR SITUATIONGeneral Review.39. Weather greatly restricted our night operations, the principal attacks were made on the industrial centre of Berlin, and the Scharnhorst and Gneisenauat Brest. Numerous successful daylight attacks were carried out against enemy shipping. In Africa and the Balkans our air operations were of considerableintensity.[22450] c
A heavy night attack was made on London, and&apos;Plymouth was raided on three successive nights.   Enemy aircraft were very active in Greece and Libya.Germany and Occupied Territory.40 During the week Bomber Command carried out 210 day and 363 nightsorties; compared with the preceding week the scale of operations by day was approximately the same, but by night there was a substantial reduction. these operations were supported by Coastal Command, notably by attacks on Brest,and Fighter Command flew a number of offensive patrols both by day and nightover enemy-occupied territory.Day.41. The majority of daylight sorties have been directed against enemy shipping, details of which will be found under Coastal Operations. On the17th April, 18 Blenheims, escorted by six squadrons of fighters, bombed the docks at Cherbourg, many bursts were seen around the target and several fires were observed. On the 21st April, a similar operation was undertaken against theelectricity power station at Havre; cloud prevented the location of this target,but the harbour at Quetthou, in the vicinity of Havre, was attacked, bursts beingseen on the railhead alongside the docks. Other aircraft attacked shipping, but no important results were seen. From these two operations the 36 bombersengaged returned safely, but one Spitfire was lost on the return journey fromHavre.42. Blenheims carried out a successful attack against the docks atTerneuzen, and also attacked the harbour at Breskens. Two direct hits weremade on a railway bridge and on the permanent way in the vicinity of Leyden.Two aircraft attacked the electricity power sation at Ibbenburen, twenty miles west of Osnabruck; blue smoke was seen issuing from the power house and muchdebris was thrown into the air. Four aircraft attacked a wireless station onTerschelling Island, the building being enveloped in smoke and dust.43. Fighters flew a number of offensive patrols over Northern France andBelgium. On one occasion gun emplacements near Wimereux and a jetty east of Calais were machine-gunned, on another patrol two E-boats were machine-gunned near Gravelines. During these operations very few enemy aircraft were encountered; one Me. 109 was shot down in flames and another probably destroyed;one Spitfire is missing.Night.44. On the night of the 7th/18th April, 118 bombers, including oneStirling, were sent to attack the industrial centre of Berlin; 66 tons of H.E.,including one 4,000 lb., three 2,000 lb. and six 1,900 lb. bombs were dropped.Thick haze prevented detailed observation of results, but bursts were seen on theSchlesischer station and the Lehrter marshalling yard; it is estimated that the4,000 lb. bomb fell in the Moabit district. One aircraft dropped propaganda leaflets. Bad weather prevented some of our bombers from locating Berlin andthese attacked a number of alternative targets.45. The industrial centre of Cologne was attacked on the night of the20th/21st April by 33 aircraft and a lighter scale of attack was made on the night of the 17th/18th April; bursts were seen in the centre of the town and anumber of fires were started. On two occasions the petroleum harbour at rotterdam was bombed by a total of 25 aircraft, about 35 tons of H.E. and alarge number of LBs. were dropped.46. The enemy battle-cruisers at Brest were attacked on five nightsby aircraft of Coastal Command and on two nights by aircraft of bomber command, when about 120 tons of H.E., including forty-two 2,000 lb. bombs were dropped. On account of bad weather or very dark nights combined with intensesearchlight and A.A. activity detailed results were very difficult to observe;however, a number of bursts were seen in the area of the dry dock and one aircraftreports having seen the battle-cruiser alongside the quay and claims a hit or nearmiss on the quayside. Bursts were also observed in the area of the torpedo-boatstation and a number of fires were started.
47.   Six Coastal Command aircraft attacked the Caen-Carpiquet aerodromeand all bombs were seen to burst in the area, but results could not be observed.On two nights the docks at Havre were attacked, on each occasion by six Blenheimsfrom the same command; many bursts were seen in the target area, fires were started, and a warehouse and dock buildings were hit.48. A number of aerodromes and other military objectives in Germany and occupied territory were successfully attacked, mostly by single aircraft.49.   A few offensive patrols over enemy territory were flown at night by aircraft of Fighter Command.   On one occasion an enemy aircraft, believed tobe a four-engine type, about to land at St. Leger, was attacked and appeared to&apos;break up in the air.United Kingdom.50. Fighter Command flew 1,458 patrols, involving 3,527 sorties, by day,and 590 night sorties were flown. Enemy activity by day was again on asmall scale and by night showed a considerable reduction on the preceding week,about 1,170 aircraft being employed.51. Enemy activity by day consisted very largely of defensive patrols in theStraits and off the French and Belgian coasts, and of reconnaissances over thesouthern and eastern portions of England. The usual reconnaissances and patrols were flown over the sea. On the 17th April, eight Spitfires engaged four Me. 110over Ramsgate, two of which were destroyed. A Ju. 88 was shot down by our fighters off Bognor; during the week several other encounters took place, in whicha few of our fighters were lost and about an equal number of enemy aircraft were probably destroyed.52. The heaviest raid took place on the night of the 19th/20th April andwas mainly directed against London and the Eastern Home counties; approxi-mately 350 enemy aircraft were employed, 10 of which made two sorties. On the night of the 21st/22nd and the two following nights, attacks were mainly directed against Plymouth and Devonport; the first two attacks were on a heavy scale; onthe third night the attack was less severe. On the night of the 17th/ 18th, a heavy attack was made on Portsmouth, but on the remaining two nights of the weekenemy activity was on a very small scale.Coastal Operations.53. Coastal Command aircraft flew 302 patrols and provided escorts for152 convoys, involving a total of 977 sorties. In addition, Fighter Command made1,689 sorties on shipping protection patrols.54. On the 18th April, an aircraft on routine patrol sighted a convoy of eight merchant vessels off Stavanger; two formations of Blenheims from coastal command were sent out, in the morning and afternoon respectively, to attackthis convoy. As a result of the first patrol a 7,000-ton vessel is believed to havebeen hit, and a 3,000-ton vessel was hit twice and seen to be rapidly sinking; twoof our aircraft were lost. During the second patrol the Blenheims were attacked by five Me. 110, three of our aircraft being shot down, but all were able to droptheir bombs and a direct hit is estimated on another ship.55. On each day of the week formations of aircraft have been sent out fromBomber Command to attack enemy shipping, with the following results : 7,000-ton M.V. believed hit off Brest.800-ton ship off Hoedenserke seen to disintegrate.4,000-ton M.V. off Heligoland believed hit; was last seen with large columnsof smoke issuing from amidships.5,000-ton M.V. off Heligoland, attacked from 50 feet and left on fire listingto starboard.A Flak ship off Heligoland probably hit.7,000-ton M.V. off Texel received two hits and was seen to have a list of35 degrees.6,000-ton M.Y. off Terschelling was probably hit.
5,000-ton M.V. off Scheveningen was attacked from 100 feet and was leftsinking.3,000-ton M.V. off S.W. Norway was hit; the ship stopped and was down bythe stern.2,000-ton cargo ship N.W. of Stavanger was hit, resulting in an explosionaft of the funnel with considerable smoke and steam issuing from theship.8.000-ton M.V. off the Dutch Coast received three direct hits and was lastseen with clouds of smoke and steam issuing from it-56. In addition a number of other attacks were made resulting in near misses and many ships were machine-gunned. A 3,000-ton ship was seen beachedN. of Egersund and another ship of 4/5,000 tons was seen sinking off Den Helder.57. Details of mining by aircraft and enemy activity against our shippingare reported in the Naval Situation.The Balkans.58. During the week the activity of our aircraft was mainly directed against enemy communications, transport and aerodromes. A heavy attack wasmade by our bombers on a bridge in the Kozani-Greven-Kulabaka area, and manybombs burst among mechanical transport. The aerodromes at Larissa and Sedeswere bombed and at the latter, a number of fires were seen followed by explosionsbelieved to be aircraft. The aerodromes at Kozani and Katerini were bothsuccessfully attacked.59. On a number of occasions our fighters engaged large formations of enemy aircraft, Seven Hurricanes destroyed three German bombers and onefighter when fifty aircraft were found to be attacking one of our columns; on another occasion seven Hurricanes on an offensive patrol destroyed one Henscheland three Me. 109s. On the 20th April, formations of German aircraft continuallyapproached the Athens area; fifteen Hurricanes were sent up and destroyednineteen enemy aircraft and probably a further eight; five of our fighters were lost, the pilots of two are safe. Numerous other engagements took place in whicha further number of enemy aircraft were destroyed.60. The chief role of the German Air Force in this area continued to be close and strategic support for the Army, but a certain effort by long-range bombers has been maintained against harbours and shipping.61 Towards the end of this period dive-bombers with fighter escort were operating against shipping, these aircraft now being within effective range fromadvanced bases. The rapid movement of short-range aircraft to advanced landing grounds continues to be a feature of the operations, the availability of transport aircraft making it possible to supply these units.Malta.62. Daily raids were made against the Island, but generally on a small scale, except on the evening of the 22nd April, when about forty German aircraftmade a large-scale raid on the dockyard, many bombs and mines being dropped;as a result of this raid considerable damage was done to service and civilian pro-perty. During the week Hurricanes shot down three Italian and one Germanfighter and A.A. destroyed one German bomber; several other enemy aircraft were either probably destroyed or damaged.63. Glenn Martin aircraft carried out numerous very valuable reconnais-sances, in particular of the Tunisian Coast, Tripoli and the Ionian Sea.Egypt and Libya.64. On three nights during the week Wellingtons operating from Maltabombed the harbour at Tripoli; the Spanish Quay and ships were straddled, twohits were made on the west mole and a number of fires were started. On three nights attacks were made on shipping and the harbour at Benghazi by Welling-tons, a number of fires were started one of which was visible fifty miles away; a successful daylight attack was also made, a ship in the harbour being hit.
65. Many attacks were made against enemy aerodromes including those atBerka, Gazala, Derna and El Adem. Enemy mechanical transport and troops were also heavily and continually attacked; oh one occasion Hurricanes machine-gunned two German M.T. columns inflicting heavy casualties on motorised troops,on another occasion fifty-five aircraft were bombed on the ground at Derna. Asa result of these attacks many M.T. vehicles were destroyed and enemy movementswere greatly restricted.66. Enemy operations mainly consisted of attacks against the fortificationsat Tobruk, little other activity taking place beyond heavy fighter protection forConvoys. Reconnaissances were made in the forward area, particular attentionbeing paid to our sea and land supply routes. Nineteen German aircraft are known to have been shot down, fifteen by fighters and four by A.A. defences.Dodecanese.67.   On the night of the 22nd/23rd April the aerodrome at Calato wasraided and the harbour at Rhodes was heavily attacked.Italian East Africa.68. Our aircraft have continued to attack the Italian aerodromes, the most successful result being achieved at Dessie, where fighters of the South AfricanAir Force destroyed seven enemy aircraft on the ground. Many successful attacks were also carried out against enemy positions, troops and mechanical transport.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.69. Very few incidents occurred during the week, but at Fraserburgh,Scotland, two incidents on different days caused some damage and seven people were killed.By Night.70. The enemy bombing has been concentrated on London, one night, andon Plymouth for three successive nights. Portsmouth also received a measure of attention. The number of incidents outside the attacked areas has been remark-ably small.71. On the 17th/18th April the chief bombing occurred in Portsmouth andneighbouring Hampshire districts for some seven hours with small effect.72. On the 18th/&apos;19th April bombing was negligible,, but on the following night a heavy attack occurred on London and the Home Counties. In london the Docks were chiefly affected. Some 1,460 fires were started and about 63 para-chute mines were dropped. In the Home Counties there were many incidents.Casualties and damage occurring at Rochester, Dartford, Reigate and Romford.73. After a quiet night on the 20th/21st April, Plymouth was bombed forthe last three nights of the period. On the night of the 21st/22nd April the bombs were dropped chiefly in the dockyard area of Plymouth, but the centre ofthe city was also considerably affected. Some 30 large fires were started and the casulties were heavy.74. On the 22nd/23rd April outside the Plymouth area a public shelterwas hit at Southsea, causing several casualties, and minor bombing occurred inScotland. At Plymouth communications suffered severely and the Control Centrehad to be evacuated. By midnight 23 fires were burning, only one being under control. The Fore Street area of Devonport was chiefly affected, and the positionin the city was made worse by a high wind. On the following day control wasgained of most of the fires.75. On the 23rd/24th April the attack on Plymouth was not so serious ason the previous night, but some fires gave anxiety in the Milbay area. All exceptone fire in the centre of the city and fires at the oil cisterns at Tor Point were[22450] u
under control by 0200 hrs. It is thought that the casualties will not be heavy.Some fires occurred at Portsmouth, but in the rest of the country only very minorincidents occurred76. In the Dock area considerable damage was caused to warehouses, ,silos,timberyards, barges, trucks and offices. Traffic was much disturbed on the LondonNorth Eastern and Southern Railways, but other utility services escaped lightly.77. Public buildings damaged include the Royal Naval College at Green-wich, the Japanese Embassy and five museums. Of the hospitals, a serious fireoccurred at St. Peter&apos;s Hospital. Stepney, where casualties occurred.Plymouth and Devonport.78. As yet it is early to assess the damage for the three nights, but it isknown that considerable damage occurred in the Dockyards. Fires occurred atthe Military Area Headquarters, at the Naval Exchange and at Naval, Militaryand Marine Barracks. All utilities were affected, the Devonport TelephoneExchange being destroyed, the main G.W.R. main down line wrecked, and considerable damage at the Plymouth Goods Yard. Four oil cisterns at Tor Pointwere still burning at 0440 on the 24th April.Casualties.79. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours, the23rd April, are 2,035 killed and 3,899 seriously injured.

Pilot Cutter Pioneer bombed and machine-gunned in thames estuary and towed to Gravesend.V&amp;th April. A/P Trawler Kopanes bombed and sunk off Tyne.The following casualties to Naval personnel have been reported : Officers : Killed 9, missing 31, wounded 6.Ratings : Killed 137, missing 236, wounded 96.Four missing officers later reported prisoners of war are now reportedreleased.
Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.THE following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources :  Germany.Berlin. Further information as to the March raids state that theKlingenberg Power Station was severely damaged, and some confirmation of thiswas received from another source, who stated that one of the power stations had broken down and that electric light in some quarters had been out of order onthe 13th, 14th and 15th March. Taking into account previous reports, it now seems clear that the Kleist Strasse district suffered severely and the neighbourhoodof the Charlottenburg station was also badly damaged. Houses in the AugsburgerStrasse, the Waitzstrasse and Neue Kant Strasse were destroyed or damaged.The raid on the 9th/10th April is stated to have caused considerable material damage and casualties, and resulted in the authorities for the first time being-unable to hide from the majority of the inhabitants the extent of the damage.Particulars so far available show that about 20 buildings in the Unter denLinden were destroyed. The State library (which is opposite the former palaceof the Kaiser) was gutted and the State Opera House (which lies between thatpalace and the former palace of the Crown Prince) was demolished. Fires were started in the principal food office and the boiler house of the main fire stationreceived a direct hit. The raid on the 17th/18th April is reported as havingcaused consternation in the German Embassy at Ankara. A large number of people are said to have been killed and the behaviour of the members of theGerman Embassy Staff made it obvious that they received news that.had alarmedthem.Kiel. Photographs taken on the 17th April show the further damage caused in the raids of the 8th/9th and 15th/16th April. The greater part appears tohave been caused in the Deutsche Werke and Germania Shipyards and, in theGaarden residential area where the skilled shipyard workers reside. This lastarea suffered severely in the raid of the 7th/8th April and it is reasonable toassume from the further damage now disclosed that the greater part thereof hasbeen rendered uninhabitable.   Principal features include : (a) Deutsche Werke. The engine and turbine engine shops have been furtherdamaged and it has become necessary to undertake demolition andclearance of the whole of the ship stores building.(b) An area South of Deutsche  Werke -Several buildings in this areacontaining shipyard stores have been completely gutted, and it is apparent that there was a major fire in this neighbourhood.(c) Germania Yards. The angle and plate shaping sheds have been heavily damaged, a large workshop destroyed and the locomotive sheds andsmithy building completely gutted.(d) An area between Kleiner Kiel and Schreven Pond. This is another&apos;&apos; blitzed &apos;&apos; area of the town. There are a minimum of 14 points of major damage and the whole area must have suffered from blast orfire. In the Hohenzollern Ring nearby a block of houses 200 yardslong have their roofs and upper storeys destroyed or damaged by fire.Cologne. Photographs taken on the 8th April show that the city power station building had been gutted. Some confirmation of the damage to theHohenzollern bridge (previously reported) is obtained from these photographswhich disclose a remarkable lack of rail activity&apos;in the main station and the marshalling yards on each side of the river. The house of 4711 &quot; Eau deCologne &quot; received a direct hit and 20 people are believed to have been killed inthe building.
Bremen. The Ju. 87 Assembly Factory (previously reported damaged) was hit in the raid of the 12th/13th March. An iron works and the engine sheds onthe Western side of the Kohlenhafen were also hit and damaged in this raid, 8locomotives being practically destroyed.General. A German living near Wilhelmshaven has given the followingaccount of raids to his daughter, married to a neutral. She was not allowed to visit him at home and the visit took place in Berlin : He stated the docks at Wilhelmshaven had been shot to pieces and the damage was devastating. Some submarine building was still going on, butnot more than 10 per cent, of the normal. Nobody was allowed to see the damage, but the extent was known from the workmen who went there dailyand from the numbers thrown out of employment, Hanover also sufferedappalling damage. Most of the bombs hit objectives of military importance,including Hanomag a,nd the Continental Rubber Works.France.Brest. Reports have been received of hits on both the battle cruisers. It isstated that during one of the early attacks an aircraft attacking alone in theearly hours of the morning scored a direct hit on one of them. This aircraft was subsequently shot down and the pilot, a Canadian aged about 19, was saved.(A Canadian pilot aged 19 belonging to 22 Squadron Coastal Command is missing from an attack on Brest on the 6th April, 1941.) A factor which may also indicate damage to the battle-cruisers is that Admiral Raeder has recently made a special visit to inspect them. The Prefecture Maritime and the Salle desFetes have been hit and damaged.Bulgaria.Sofia. In the raid on the 13th/14th April direct hits were obtained on an ammunition train. The petrol storage installation was hit and explosions were still taking place 8 hours after the raid finished. The area surrounding themain station was damaged and the accuracy of the bombing was described asexcellent.i&apos;
