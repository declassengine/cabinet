Printed for the Cabinet, May, 1941MOST secret.P, (41) 114.29th May, 1941     to military POLICY FOR EAST africa memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. The surrender of the Duke of Aosta brings one stage nearer the end ofthe campaign in Italian East Africa.I have been considering the future military policy for these territories, andthe forces which, so far as can be foreseen, will have to be retained there afterthe final collapse of Italian military resistance.2. On the assumption that no organized resistance continues in the whole area of East Africa south of the Egyptian border, the military problem becomesmainly one of internal security, and for this purpose we can hope to reducevery considerably the forces now employed, and effect a considerable sub-stitution of police for military units.From such examination of the problem as is possible here, and subjectto the requirements of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, who will bear the responsibility for the security of our interests in these areas, it appears thatforces.of the following order might suffice :  (i) In the Sudan, part of the Sudan Defence Force with a small british garrison.(ii) In our own East African Colonies, Colonial garrison units only.(iii) In Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, Armies of Occupation comprisingIndian units of lower category, African Colonial units, and part ofthe Sudan Defence Force.(iv) In Ethiopia, to assist the Emperor in the prevention of disorder andthe protection of foreigners, forces of similar categories to those under (iii).The exact strength and distribution of these forces is of course, a matter for the commanders concerned, but it would seem that the existing African colonial forces, the Indian State Forces units already in East Africa and now being sentthere from India, and the Sudan Defence Force, should with a small stiffeningof British troops, suffice for these tasks.3. This would release the balance of the forces now employed in the east african theatre to reinforce the main armies in the north. Parallel with themovement of these forces, the troops on the lines of communication throughEast Africa and the Sudan can be reduced and moved northwards. TheCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, is already transferring, as transportationfacilities permit, the 1st South African Division and 5th Indian Division to thenorth.4. In order to reduce to the minimum the calls for military units in EastAfrica it is important to remove as rapidly as possible Italian prisoners of war,and ships returning empty from Suez to the United Kingdom, South Africa,India or Australia can be used for this purpose. There are 58,000 white and47,000 native prisoners of war from the East African campaign, and 69,000white and 12,500 native prisoners of war from the Libyan campaign. Of these,52,000 white prisoners of war have been evacuated from Libya. The processof evacuation is continuing as rapidly as shipping allows. The Commander-in-Chief, in addition, has been given authority to release large numbers ofnatives, Abyssinians, Eritrians and Somalis upon terms laid down by himself.
5- The War Cabinet has already agreed on the policy to be followed withregard to the exercise by the Emperor of de facto authority in Ethiopia, and theCommander-in-Chief has been instructed accordingly. - r: -       - yTo reduce to the minimum our commitment for the safety of Italians remain-ing in Ethiopia we should make the greatest possible use of Ethiopian Rasesapproved by our own authorities and of local police forces. We should alsoaim at removing as many Italian nationals as possible from Ethiopia.An approach has been made to the Italian Government suggesting that theyshould provide ships, under safe conduct from us, for the repatriation of civiliansto Italy, and I understand that a favourable response has been received. Somereservation may have to be made in respect of the conditions under which shipping will be provided by Italy, and with regard to iepatriation of men ofmilitary age, technicians, etc., but, since most of these will already be prisonersof war, I do not anticipate any great difficulty. In addition, tentative arrange-ments are being made for the accommodation of Italian civilians in SouthernEhodesia, Kenya and Uganda but, in view of the attitude of the Italian Govern-ment towards repatriation and in the light of the restraint shown by the native population in Ethiopia, it may not be necessary to pursue this further at thepresent time.6. I, therefore, ask the War Cabinet to approve the general policy set out above.  I will then send the necessary instructions to the Commander-in-ChiefMiddle East. -D.
