In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on the19th May I sent a code telegram to  the    Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government were disposed to apply conscription to Northern Ireland and wouldbe glad of. an expression of the views of the Northern ireland government.      I understand the matter was discussed by theNorthern Ireland Cabinet yesterday and that a telegram has beensent to me of which the gist  is as follows:-(a) The Cabinet are emphatically of opinion that conscription should apply to Northern Ireland.(b) They consider  there may be opposition and thatit  is impossible to forecast  the  extent of theopposition,  but the difficulties will be morethan offset by the advantages.2.      Resistance to conscription may take three forms:(i) There may be open disorder but if this were confined to members of the I.R-A-   it is estimated that thereare only about two  thousand such members in NorthernIreland and the difficulty of dealing with it shouldnot be substantial.(ii) The men liable to conscription may escape across the..., , .       border.      The. simplest way of dealing.with thiswould be  to allow it but to arrest any &quot;men whotried to slip back after their registration datehad passed.(iii) There may be wholesale refusal to register.      This is... ... :the most serious form and might be. very, extensiveif it were ordered from above either by the catholic church or by Nationalist Societies.       It  is.impossible to forecast how extensive the resistancemight be but if. conscription is adopted theGovernment must be prepared to deal with large scaleresistance.    . The prison accommodation in. NorthernIreland is limited and nearly full already and as a last resort the Government must be prepared to setup concentration camps for thousands of resisters,reducing the problem If possible to manageableproportions by not  calling up too large a number atany one t irrie.
3.      There is the possibility that there may be a renewal&apos;&quot;of the strife between Protestant and Catholic workmen wi thsome disorder in shipyards and other places and consequentlysome adverse effect on production.HOME.OFFICE. &apos;22nd May,: 1941.
