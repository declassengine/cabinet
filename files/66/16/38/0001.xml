Let me knowr what Forces you have in the island and- wdiat your plans are. It ought to-be a fine opportunity forkilling the parachute troops&quot;  The island must be stubbornly defended.(2)General Wavell to the Prime Minister and Chiefs of Staff, in reply, April 29.1941.(0/60449.   29/4.)Ref. your 63822 (M.O. 5) of 28 April from Prime Minister and C.O.S. No. 84(63952 M.O. 5) of 29 April.1. Crete was warned of possibility of air-borne attack on 18 April. Besidesoriginal permanent garrison of three infantry battalions, two hy. A.A. btys.,three light A.A. btys. and coast defence arty., Crete now contains at least 30,000personnel evacuated from Greece. These are being organized for the defenceof the vital places on the island : Suda Bay, Canea, Retimo and Heraklion. Morale[22546] b34

In additioncertain units of Greek recruits have been organized for defence of aerodromes and prisoners of war. .      .&apos;   2   JVINBDO due to reach island during first fortnight in May.3    Propose visiting Crete to-morrow and will report on return.4 It is just possible that plan for attack on Crete may be cover for attackon Syria or Cyprus, and that real plan will only be disclosed even to own troops at last moment. This would be consistent with German practice.(3)The War Office to the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, April 28, 1941.(64141 (M.I. 14.   29/4.)Following is summary of J.I.C. appreciation of scale of attack on Crete for your appreciation : German attack Crete by simultaneous air-borne and sea-borne expeditionbelieved imminent.Scale of air-borne attack estimated 3,000/4,000 parachutists or air-bornetroops in first sortie. Two or three sorties per day possible from Greece andthree or four from Rhodes, if Rhodes not used as dive-bomber base. All abovewith fighter escort.Heavy bombing attacks to be expected immediately prior to arrival of air and sea-borne troops. Main fighter and dive-bombing support probably basedRhodes. Following is our estimate based on establishment of operational aircraftavailable in Balkans for all purposes. 315 long-range bombers, 60 twin-enginedfighters, 240 dive-bombers, 270 single-engined fighters. Last two categories wouldrequire extra tanks if operated from north of Corinth Canal. Only very smallattacks from points south of this owing to aerodrome shortage in Morea, but some60/90 dive-bombers and similar number single-engined fighters could operate fromRhodes provided aerodromes in Rhodes not required for other operations.Estimated that both troops and shipping ample for sea-borne operation, andlighters for transport of tanks also believed available, hence scale of sea-borneattack dependent of extent to which enemy can evade our naval forces.Reinforcements enemy naval forces and shipping from Italy possible, but involveshazardous route round Cape Matapan, if Corinth Canal unusable.(4)General Wavell to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, April 30, 1941.. (0/60820.   30/4.)Personal for C.I.G.S. from General Wavell:  1. Visited Crete by air to-day. Placed Freyberg in command all troops inIsland, including Greek troops (this is at request of Greek Government), asimmediate measure.   Your 64174 (C.I.G.S.).*2. Defence of Crete at present difficult and dangerous commitment in viewcomplete enemy air superiority, and I am by no means confident that we canprevent enemy landing on scale suggested by your 64141. We have no Field* Artillery in Island, though some is being sent at once. Am seeing Cunninghamto-morrow and will cable full appreciation later. Defence of Crete v/illundoubtedly involve heavy commitment all three services.* Not reproduced.
The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office, in reply to telegramNo. (3), May 1, 1941.(1/60931.   1/5.)Your 64141 (M.I. 14), 29/4.Agree information points to early attack on Crete by simultaneous air-borneand sea-borne expeditions. Must, however, bear in mind possibility cover planCyprus. Syria and Iraq. Latter suggested by latest developments Iraq.Consider your estimates scale air attack excessive. Your figures regardingbombers appear to be based upon establishments of aircraft in &quot;Balkans. sicily and Libya. Our estimates based on operational aircraft likely available Balkansas follows : 150 single-engined fighters; 40 twin-engined fighters. We thinkbulk air forces taking part would be based on Greece. Our information pointsinsufficient sea-going shipping left iEgean for large-scale sea-borne operations,but, if Turkey allows passage through Dardanelles, shipping and lighters shouldbe available from Roumania.(6)General Wavell to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, May 2, 1941.(0/61232.   2/5.)Personal for C.I.G.S. from General Wavell: 1. Defence of Crete will present difficult problem for all three servicesmainly on account of enemy superiority. Ports and aerodromes being in north ofIsland involve greater exposure of aircraft and shipping. Only good road inIsland (and that none too good) runs- east and west along north coast and alsoexposed.2. There are no good roads north and south or Harbours on south coast,though with time it may be possible to develop them. There is great shortageof transport in Island.3. Food for civil population will have to be imported in considerable quantities. If towns heaviiy bombed and we are unable provide fighter protectionwe may be faced with political problem.4. To garrison Island effectively at least three brigade groups required and considerable number of A.A. units. Present garrison 3 British regular battalions,6 N.Z. battalions, 1 Australian Battalion and two composite battalions of detailsevacuated from Greece. Those from Greece are weak in numbers and equipment.There is no artillery.   Scale of A.A. defence inadequate, but is being reinforced.5. As regards Air Force, see A. 466 of 24th April* from A.O.C.-in-C.;there are at present no modern aircraft in island.6. Greek troops at present of little or no value, they are mostly untrainedand unarmed and morale of many doubtful.7. Difficulties are being dealt with, and will be overcome if we get time,but Air defence will always be difficult problem.* Not reproduced.(7)General Freyberg to the Prime Minister, May 5, 1941.(4231.   5/5.)For Prime Minister, England, from General Freyberg : Many thanks for your cable. Cannot understand nervousness, am not in theleast anxious about airborne attack, have made my dispositions and feel can copeadequately with the troops at my disposal. Combination of seaborne and airborneattack is different.   If that comes before I can get the guns and transport here[22546] b 2
the situation will be difficult. Even so, provided Navy can help, trust all willbe well.When we get our equipment and transport, and with a few extra fighter aircraft it should be possible to hold Crete. Meanwhile there will be a periodhere during which we shall be vulnerable.Everybody in great form and most anxious to renew battle with our enemy,whom we hammered whenever we met him in Greece.All New Zealanders greatly and justly incensed at not being mentionedadequately in B.B.C. and Press accounts of the vital and gallant part played bythem in Greek rearguard action.(8)The Chiefs of Staff to the Commanders-in-Chief, Mediterranean and middle East, May 9, 1941.(65870 (M.O. 5).   9/5.)Following for Commanders-in-Chief from Chiefs of Staff No. 98 :  &quot; Reference Scorcher.   So complete is our information that it appears toc?^-    present heaven sent opportunity of dealing enemy heavy blow.  It is now questionof preparing subtle plan calculated to inflict maximum losses upon enemy.   Weare studying possible plans and methods and will telegraph results which we hopemay be useful to you.&quot;Please pass to A.O.C.-in-C. as from Air Ministry.(9)    .The Chiefs of Staff to the Commanders-in-Chief, Mediterranean and middle East, May 10, 1941.(65972 (M.O. 5).   10/5.)Following from Chiefs of Staff for Commanders-in-Chief : -ifc Jfc -ifc Jfc AL- -i/--7V- &quot;TV&quot; W -A- W3.

It might be possibleto disembark some tanks loaded on the deck of Clan Lamont immediately as shearrives at Alexandria, and send them at once to Crete.******(10)Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office in reply to the precedingtwo telegrams, May 10, 1941.(0/63313.  10/5.)Your 65870 (M.O.5) and 65972 (M.0.5). Had already arranged to sendt 6 infantry tanks and 15 light tanks to Crete, these should arrive within next* few days if all goes well. Have reinforced Island with artillery and am sendingadditional equipment Army and R.A.F. Staff Officers to Crete to-morrow, will discuss Defence Plan, which is not easy for several reasons. Your suggestionswill be put before Freyberg, but details must be left to him. Have full confidence in him and his troops.  Navy and R.A.F. considering their plans.
(12)General Wavell to the Prime Minister in reply, May 13, 1941.(0/64018.   13/5.)Prime Minister from General Wavell : ******2. Do not think it possible to send any more Inf. tanks in time for*&apos; Scorcher.&quot;  If those sent arrive safely this evening they should suffice.******(13)The Prime Minister to General Wavell, May 14, 1941.(021.   14/5.)Prime Minister to General Wavell : All my information points to need for Scorcher any day after 17th. Every-thing seems to be moving in concert for that and with great elaboration. Hopeyou have got enough in Cjoiorado and that those there have the needful in cannon,machine-guns and A.F.Vs. It may well be that in so large and complicated a plan zero date will be delayed. Therefore, reinforcements sent now might wellarrive in time and certainly for the second round should enemy gain a footing.I should particularly welcome chance for our high-class troops to come to closegrips with those people under conditions where enemy has not got his usualmechanical advantages, and where we can surely reinforce much easier than hecan. I suppose Admiral js with you in every detail of this and that you andTedder have concerted the best possible Air plan, having regard to other tasks.All good wishes.(14)General Wavell to the Prime Minister in reply, May 15, 1941.(0/64501.   15/5.)Prime Minister from General Wavell:  Your 021.1. Have done best to equip Colorado against beetle pest. Recent reinforce-ments include 6 I tanks, 16 light tanks, 18 A.A. guns, 17 field guns, one battalion.Am preparing small force, one or two battalions with some tanks, to land southside Colorado as reserve. Propose also holding Polish Brigade as possiblereinforcement.   But problem landing reinforcements is difficult.2. Cunningham, Tedder and I discussed Colorado, 12 May, followed by inter-service &quot;staff meeting.  We have concerted plans as far as possible.3. Colorado is not easy commitment, and German blitzes usually take somestopping.

Two inf. tanks are at each aerodrome.Carriers and transport still being unloaded and delivered. 2/Leicesters havearrived and will make Heraklion stronger.
