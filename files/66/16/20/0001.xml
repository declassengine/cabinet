The stage now reached in the development of the emergency fire brigade-organisation may be summarised as follows : -(a) The emergency organisation is based on the peace-time fire brigades,which are administered by the London County Council in London,and, elsewhere in England and Wales, by the Councils of Boroughs.Urban Districts and Rural Districts. In Scotland, unlike England,County Councils have fire brigade powers, and 11 of the 33 Countieshave County fire brigades. Elsewhere, I understand, the organisationi! in Scotland is similar to that in England and Wales.   There are thusn about 1;440 separate fire brigade authorities in England and Wales,and nearly as many fire brigades. The brigades vary greatly in size,from the London Fire Brigade, with about 3,000 professional firemenand more than 150 major appliances, to brigades with only a fewpart-time firemen and no appliances save a few lengths of hose andother hand equipment. The total strength of the peace-timebrigades in England and Wales is about 25,000, but only about 6,000are whole-time firemen.,(&amp;,) For emergency purposes, the regular fire brigade organisation has been......     greatly expanded, the scale of the expansion being of the order of15 to 20 times for the more important towns, or even higher in a few cases. The total whole-time strength of the Auxiliary Fire service is about 80,000 (including telephonists and messengers), and the part-time strength about 150,000, with about 25,000 power appliances,i.e., not counting hand equipment.(c) Each borough and urban district, and in a good many cases the rural district, has its Auxiliary Fire Service contingent, auxiliary firestations, a supply of emergency equipment produced and issued bythe Home Office, an emergency communications system, supplemented by messengers and often by special observation posts, and itsemergency scheme of operations for the borough or district. In:. . addition to this local organisation there is the regional reinforcementscheme, under which a proportion of the major appliances availablein any district may at any time be despatched as reinforcements toother districts, under the directions of the Regional Commissioner.:and under this scheme large numbers of appliances and men havebeen sent to heavily raided areas on many occasions since the heavyraids began. At Headquarters, since the Fire Brigades Division was constituted in 1936, the staff has been expanded to deal with theproduction of the emergency equipment (in * collaboration with the[22482]
Ministry of Works and Buildings) and to supervise the general development of the emergency measures as a whole; and the Depart-ment is assisted by regional technical staffs, who act in the dualcapacity of Inspectors and staff officers to the Regional Commissioners.3. A very large emergency organisation has therefore been built up, but itwill be seen, from what has been said above, that in many cases the local emergency measures rest on relatively slender administrative foundations. Even in the caseof the larger towns, where the technical and administrative staffs of the fire brigades are strongest, the effectiveness of the expanded emergency servicesnaturally varies from place to place, depending largely on the attitude of the localauthorities in matters of exependitm-e and the enterprise and capacity of their officers.4. Where there are still defects and shortcomings in the local emergency organisation, they generally arise from shortage of man-power, a good many ofthe key centres being still considerably under establishment (in spite of all theefforts made to obtain recruits), from shortage of towing vehicles for trailerpumps or from inadequacy of the measures for procuring emergency supplies ofwater when the normal supplies are interrupted in a raid. In addition, and perhaps most important &quot;of all, there is a general shortage of officers with large-scale fire fighting and administrative experience, in comparison with the numbers which are required in a large-scale air attack and for planning and carrying outthe many measures which are necessary to provide against that contingency.These shortages, so far as they relate to man-power, are now about to be made good under the new National Service Act procedure, so far as general man-powerlimitations will permit; the local authorities are being assisted to obtainadditional towing vehicles, and I have initiated the policy of obtaining by centralinstead of local purchase the lorries which are needed for regional reinforcementpurposes. The measures for augmenting the supplementary supplies of waterare particularly important and are being pressed forward, as labour and other conditions will permit, with all possible help and support from Regional Head-quarters and the Home Office. In particular, I have introduced the use of linesof surface steel piping, as emergency mains, to supplement the ordinary pressuremains in high risk areas or to take their place, to the extent that that is possible,when the normal supplies of water are interrupted. For the shortage of experienced officers there is no solution except as more men gain the necessaryexperience under emergency conditions. All that can be done is to give such assistance as is possible by staff training and to make the best use of such menas are available.5. Since the heavy raids began all local fire authorities and their officers have been reminded of the necessity for these and other measures, whichexperience has shown to be necessary by way of precaution against the conse-quences of such attacks; and the instructions which have been issued have been followed up at Conferences held for the purpose in all Regions and by the regional staffs, which have been strengthened for the purpose. arrangements have been made to move into heavily raided areas experienced officers from otherbrigades, as temporary reinforcements, and the regional and Headquartersofficers have also taken charge of the local fire fighting organisations, in temporaryrelief of the chief officer, on several occasions.6. Taking the emergency fire fighting services as a whole, they have certainlyproved their worth. On more than one occasion when the enemy has brought hisheaviest attacks to bear the local brigades and Auxiliary Fire Services have dealt successfully with the attacks, virtually without reinforcement, and can be relied upon to do so as long as the attacks are fairly well dispersed and notconcentrated in the main on any one area. Generally speaking, the local authori-ties deserve considerable credit for the energy and enterprise they have shown.In spife, however, of all that has been done, there are still serious difficulties forwhich no adequate solution has been found, more especially in connection withthe measures for dealing with the more concentrated attacks and attacks whichare repeated on successive nights. These attacks often result in more or lesscomplete dislocation of water supplies and communications and serious blockingof roads as the result of H.E. bombing, and involve at the same time the handling of large fire brigade reinforcements. The extent to which fire brigades canoperate under air raid conditions must obviously depend upon the extent to whichthe movement of appliances and measures such as the relaying of water from a distance are prevented by the blocking of roads, the dislocation of communications
and the destruction of appliances and their crews, and, with increasing weightand concentration of attack, a point may be reached, and has been reached on more than one occasion, when no fire brigade, organisation could avail to preventthe spread of fires. At the: best, these concentrated air attacks ;give rise to problems which, though provided for to some extent in the local schemes, call for further measures which local authorities are frequently unwilling to take until they; have suffered in turn and it is too late and, generally, require thepreparation of plans on much more than a merely local basis. In spite of allthat has been done, and recognising that the best possible measures of civil defencemay not suffice to prevent great destruction so long as the enemy can bring heavy and concentrated attacks to bear, I am satisfied that the most serious weaknessesin the measures for providing against such attacks are mainly attributable to thelarge number of units of administration and the relatively limited resources mostof them command, individually; that little further progress can be made, and certainly no effective solution of the present difficulties can be expected, withouta radical recasting of the whole administrative machine and that the necessary changes should be made as a matter of urgency.7. In my judgment, the principal sources of weakness which are outstandingat the present time are the following : (a) Under the present system, with so many small units of administration,quite simple plans or operations may involve 20 or 30 separate localauthorities and Chief Officers of Fire Brigades, and it is virtually impossible to secure sufficient unity or breadth of plan for meetingany major contingencies, to dispose the various fire fighting resourcesaccording to requirements, viewed as a whole, or, when a crisis arises,to direct the movements of appliances and men with general, ratherthan- local, requirements as the sole consideration in view.(&amp;) For similar reasons, it is impossible to secure the best use of the availablepersonnel, especially the relatively limited number of officers who haveexperience of large-scale fire fighting or have proved their value inone capacity or another in the emergency organisation, seeing thatthey are dispersed in numerous small brigades and are the servants of different authorities, many of whom tend to put their own localconsiderations first. Tt is also very difficult to eliminate local officers who are in positions of responsibility to which they are not equal.8. I am quite satisfied that it is administratively impracticable, on the basisof the present units of administration, to expand the local services to any greaterdegree than has been done, and that there are no existing units of administrationon which the burden of reorganising the fire services could reasonably be placed.The creation of special ad hoc authorities for this purpose would be a slow andcumbrous procedure; on such a plan, which would necessarily involve the creationof relatively large units of administration and the vesting of wide powers in thehands of executive officers in charge of the consolidated brigades, local control would be retained in semblance more than in reality; and, in my view, such acourse is not to be considered as a solution ,of the problem as a whole.9. I am driven, therefore, to the conclusion that there is no alternative toeliminating local control of the fire services, for all practical purposes, for theperiod of the war. I think it is also necessary to bear in mind that, while itwould clearly be out of the question to return to the present basis of organisationwhen the war is over, the fire brigades will presumably then pass back to localauthority administration on some basis, though with much closer central super-vision than hitherto, and, for this as well as other reasons, it will be desirable toleave a portion of the cost of the regular fire services a charge on the local rates.10.   Accordingly, I propose : (i) That the administration and control of all fire brigade services, regular and auxiliary, in England and Wales, be transferred, for the periodof the emergency, from the local authorities to the Secretary of State.(It is not proposed that the ownership of land or buildings should betransferred, but only that they should be available for use as may berequired for fire brigade purposes.)(ii) that, as part of the new organisation, fresh fire brigade units be created, on the basis of the Regions and sub-Regional areas (to be constituted for the purpose), each sub-Regional unit being, in effect,a separate fire fighting force, with unity of command over the wholeresources of the sub-Region;
(iii) that power be given to the officer in command of each unit, subject tothe general supervision of Regional Headquarters and any directions of the Secretary of State, to dispose the available fire fighting resourcesas circumstances require, but so that due regard be paid to localrequirements and transfers of regular firemen and members of localA.F.S. units now serving be limited to cases of real necessity;(iv) that, similarly, power be given to fill officer posts from regular andA.F.S. officers selected for their proved capacity, irrespective of theareas where they happen now to be serving, subject to transfer ofofficers from one area to another being limited to real requirements as above;(v) that the conditions of service of the various classes of regular fire brigade personnel, which vary from force to force, be brought into lineon a co-ordinated plan, for the Service as a whole; the conditions ofservice of the Auxiliary Fire Service to remain broadly as at present;(vi) that regional reserve units be formed, with appropriate personnel andequipment, where required, in support of the localised fire fighting forces, these reserves to be under the direct control of the regional commissioners;(vii) that the Regional and sub-Regional administrative work be providedfor by extension of the existing regional organisation;(viii) that provision be made for setting up co-ordinated training for officersand men, with regional as well as central training centres;(ix) that all salaries and other -outgoings be defrayed in the first instance by the Exchequer, but that charges be made on the local ratesrepresenting 75 per cent, of the current cost of the regular fire services(which, hitherto, have been borne by the local authorities withoutExchequer grant) or, in the case of such local authorities as have not made arrangements to set up a fire service on their own account, the like proportion of the produce of a 2d. rate, as representing the reasonable cost of providing a local fire service on a modest scale.   .11. The Secretary of State for Scotland and I have taken an opportunityto consult the Regional Commissioners on these proposals, and found them ingeneral agreement as to the necessity for further measures to meet concentratedenemy attacks and, with the possible exception of the Scotland regional commissioner, as to their taking the form which I have indicated. I have every reason to believe that, so far as the members of the Fire Services areconcerned, such measures would, on the whole, be welcomed. The attitude ofthe local authorities will be important. It is only to be expected that local fire^authorities will in many cases deprecate any measure which would have the effectof taking away their present fire brigade powers. As yet, we have had no opportunity to consult the local authorities&apos; representatives, and it is not possibleto say to what extent their objections may depend upon the form such measuresmight take or whether they could be met in any degree by the formation ofconsultative committees, collaborating, in an advisory capacity, with the HomeOffice and/or the Regional Commissioners, or what their views might be on thefinancial arrangements which are suggested. Arrangements are being made to consult the local authorities&apos; representatives as soon as possible.12. The adoption of these measures would necessarily involve some additional charge upon the Exchequer. The annual cost of the regular fire brigade service may be put at about  3,000,000. The cost of the emergencyservices is about  23,000,000, of which about  21,000^000 is already borne by theExchequer, so that the burden to be transferred from the rates to the exchequer would be relatively small. Some additional Exchequer charges are to be antici-pated in respect of additional emergency fire services now in process ofdevelopment or remaining to be developed on a local or a regional basis, but these would for the most part be borne in any case by the Exchequer; and such additional Exchequer charge as might arise from the particular reorganisationproposed in this Memorandum is, in my view, fully justified by the necessities ofthe situation.H.
