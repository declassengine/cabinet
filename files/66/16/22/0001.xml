ANNEX I.143DRAFT PRESS NOTICE.   .Mercantile losses, exclusive of those in the eastern mediterranean, due to enemy action during the month of April,1914.1, were as followsBRITISH .......    h8 ships of 223,365 tons&apos;ALLIED   .......    18     &quot;     &quot;     77,353    &quot;NEUTRAL .......      1      &quot;      &quot; 352    &quot;TOTAL ..67     &quot;      11   301,070 tonsThis month covers the period of the German invasion of Jugo-Slavia and Greece and, as.was to- be expected, a numberof merchant ships were lost in connection with operations inthat theatre of war.      Several of them were attacked whilesailing on particularly hazardous voyages, but the largestproportion was bombed in Greek Ports and harbours.    - Duringthe month, 12 British ships of 69,73k tons were lost in theEastern. Mediterranean, and 2 Neutral ships of 5,210 tons.It is not possible to establish Allied losses in this theatrewith certainty, as the ultimate fate of many Greek ships must remain in doubt owing to the German occupation of the Greekmainland.      Of Allied nationalities other than Greek, the losses in the Eastern Mediterranean amounted to k ships,totalling hl*567 tons.In view of the importance attaching to our trans-Atlantic trade, it is satisfactory that the tonnage lostduring April in all theatres, excluding the eastern mediterranean, where special conditions prevailed, is lower than the losses in any of the ten preceding months.The Germans have claimed to have sunk during themonth of April 1,liij.,995 tons, and the Italians 7h,000 tons,making a total of 1,218,995 tons.It is estimated that the total tonnage lost by theenemy to date is 2,912,000 tons, made up as follows:-German losses       ...    ... ..Italian losses     ...    ...Tonnage useful to the enemy1,756,000 tons1,090,000 tons66,000 tons total     2,912,000 tonshadOn the 25th March it was announced that the enemylost up to date 2,300,000 tons.
