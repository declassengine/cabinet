Cypher TelegramPROMs    Governor (Sir&apos;W. Battershill)TO?       Secretary of State for the Colonies.D.    31st May3  1941.R.    31st    &apos;* i!        20.30 hrs.IMMEDIATE.,IT o o 217 Mos t Sec ret.Your telegram 30th May Most Secret.I assume that you are fully informed as to the military resources available for the defence of Cyprus and at present in the Island.I have discussed with the 0.Cc Troops and the Colonial Secretary.It seems to us that the fundamental question is. whether the civil government can in fact continue to function and give assistance tothe Military in the face of determined attack by air or sea-borne &apos;&quot;troops.      The conclusion reached by us is that it could not (repeatnot)  for the following reasons.   .(a) Cyprus is so small physically that the headquarters, ofCivil Government would almost certainly be involved in thefighting.      O.G. Troops could not (repeat not) with theforces (at his)  ? omitted disposal afford any protection to Headquarters of local Govermient and situation might arise when Government was captured while, troops were stillfighting in the field.      There is nowhere to which theGovernment could move away from the actual fighting fromwhich it could make some attempt to carry on the businessof Government effectively^(b) Defence Scheme of the Island envisages retention of certainfocal points unrelated to the organisation of the civil government and finally,, if necessarys  a retreat to the hillsto hold a &quot;keep&quot; and carry on guerilla warfare.      In such aretreat the elements of Civil Government would only be an embarrassment to the Forces and could not function as aGovernment either en route or in the ;ikeep:&apos;.(c) Normal functions of the Government5 such as Courts etc.would disappear on invasion,,      There are no GovernmentPublic Utilities to be considered, railway not required bythe troops.I must make it clear that I should not -in. any circumstances advise that the Civil Government should cease to functionor attempt to leave Cyprus until it was definitely known -chat the battle was joined and until theOoG.  Troops advised me that the timeLad. come for us to go.      Moreover I propose that in the circumstancescontemplated a number of essential administrative officers should remain&apos;&apos;and be attached to the OoC. Troops as Political Officers.Most of these already hold commissions in the Cyprus Volunteer Force?those that do not would be given them forthwith.Assuming that before the above stage is reached womenschildren and non-essential British officials have been evacuated.,, I might be able to arrange final evacuation of the Government in theSo So  CYPRUS,,
