(41) 1246th June, 1941      TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINETCONTROL OF OCCUPIED ENEMY TERRITORIES AND ETHIOPIAMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARIn order to give practical effect to the statement made in the House ofCommons by the Foreign Secretary on 4th February and to the Cabinet decisionembodied in W.O. telegram of the 17th May, a copy of which is attached as appendix I, it is necessary:  (a) to make arrangements for the problems connected with the administra-tion of Italian East Africa now that operations have entered upon their final phase.(6) to release the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, from pre-occupationwith these problems and to place them in the hands of a singleauthority.(c) to stabilize the civil administration in the territories in question so thatthe garrisons may be reduced and troops may be freed for serviceelsewhere, as proposed in my memorandum W.P. (41) 114 of 29th Mayand approved by the War Cabinet on 5th June, 1941.2. The main problem arises in Ethiopia. Until the recent decision of17th May (Appendix I) we have claimed the authority of an army of occupation in enemy territory and have exercised it through Generals Platt and Cunninghamin their respective areas with Sir Philip Mitchell as Chief Political Officer ingeneral departmental control of civil and political activities. The Emperor hasfrom the first objected to this. Except in an extremely limited sense, the countryis not and has never been occupied by us; and we do not propose to administerit. The Emperor is widely regarded in the country as having returned to the throne. Except in a few areas actually occupied by our troops and in areassubject to special conditions explained in Appendix II attached, the only effectiveauthority is that of the Emperor or of Ethiopian Chiefs with or without advice and support from British Military and Political Officers. But the Emperor isin an insecure position, without money, without an organized army, withoutmeans of establishing an administration and with some at least of the notablesready to take advantage of any weakness in his position.The fact is that the greater part of Ethiopia must now be regarded as falling within paragraph 5 of the telegram at Appendix I, but without our help,guidance and control it would be unreasonable to expect the Emperor to cope with so dangerous a situation.3. In order to give definition to the manner in which the help, guidance and control referred to are to be given, and military occupation brought to anend, I recommend that we should now try to come to an understanding withthe Emperor on the following general lines:  (i) the Emperor and Ethiopian authorities to agree to abide in all important matters, internal and external, touching the Governmentof the country by the advice tendered to them by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and to conduct the administration in accordance withthe advice of the officers deputed by His Majesty&apos;s Government,(ii) taxation and expenditure to require the prior approval of His Majesty&apos;governments representative.
(iii) pending further consideration of the judicial system to be applied to foreigners in Ethiopia, jurisdiction over the persons, rights or propertyof foreigners to be reserved to special courts presided over by british officers ; these courts may, however, administer Ethiopian law if the prior consent of His Majesty&apos;s Governments representative has beenobtained to the application of that law.(iv) if the   Commander-in-Chief  notifies the Emperor that  for  military reasons it is necessary to resume military control of any part of ethiopia, the Emperor will raise no objection.(v) no armed forces to be raised nor military operations undertaken except as may be agreed by His Majesty&apos;s Governments representative onthe advice of a British Military Mission.(vi) if the   foregoing conditions  prove acceptable  to the Emperor, HisMajesty&apos;s Government might offer to : (a) find such sums as may be necessary to establish the armed forces, administrative and other services immediately needed in Ethiopia.(6) make available expert advisors for.the Emperor, his ministers and provincial authorities.(c) use its best endeavours to re-establish the Ethiopian Governmentand organize its administrative, technical and social services asmay be practicable at this stage.(d) operate the communications necessary for the above to the extent that this is beyond the present capacity of Ethiopians ;(e) examine proposals for a Treaty which the Emperor and the ethiopian government, when it is in fact established, may wish to make,including a general financial settlement, which would take account of expenditure incurred in the re-conquest of Ethiopia.The points set out from (a) to (e) above coincide closely with thewishes of the Emperor expressed personally to Sir Philip Mitchell atAddis Ababa on the 24th tliny.4. If this recommendation is accepted it will amount to de facto recognitionof the Emperor as the authority administering the country. De jure recognitionwould involve important questions (see for example, Appendix II) better reservedfor the Peace Settlement; moreover, I am advised that for military and legalreasons de jure recognition at this stage is most undesirable.This recognition and the fact that operations appear to be in their closingstages, create a new situation for which existing machinery was not designed andis not suitable.5. The situation which has now to be faced in East Africa is of course stillessentially military but the problems arising in and common to the two italian colonies, British Somaliland and the native state of Ethiopia, are mainly political,administrative, judicial, financial and economic. In these circumstances, while itis important to avoid giving the impression of grouping these territories into arigid unit, it seems essential to establish, for the period in question, a singleagency for the direction of pur policy in all these complicated questions.6. I therefore propose that a high official should be appointed with thefollowing functions: (a) to exercise, with the tide of &quot; High Commissioner&quot;, full political,administrative and legislative authority in respect of Eritrea andItalian Somaliland, and supervising authority over the military governor of British Somaiiland until military exigencies permit there-establishment of Colonial Office responsibility for that territory.(6) to supervise, with the title of &quot;British Agent-General&quot;, (all Britishactivities in Ethiopia (other than British military operations) onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, between whom and the Emperorhe would be the sole channel of communication.7. I also propose; in order to be in harmony with the foregoing, that the deputy Chief Political Officers in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland should becomeMilitary Administrators, and the Deputy Chief Political Officer in Ethiopiashould become British Agent.
8. These proposals, which conform generally with the recommendations ofthe Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, and with the War Cabinet&apos;s decisions ofthe 5th June, have been considered in detail by the Standing Inter-DepartmentalCommittee which the War Cabinet set up to deal with problems in the occupied territories. For convenience, and as the background of the situation in EastAfrica is still fundamentally military, I suggest that the high official referred toin paragraph 6 should report to me. As political questions in Ethiopia are ofconsiderable importance, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will no doubtwish to be constantly consulted in relation to them. The machinery for this isprovided for by the Standing Committee referred to above.D.M.APPENDIX ISECRET0181/55Desp. 1750 17/5/41.[SECRET CIPHER TELEGRAMFrom the War Office to Force, Nairobi for Political.Rptd, C.-in-Chief, Middle East.67254, cipher (M.O. II) 17/5.Immediate,1. Following is policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding administrationof Ethiopia and is therefore the authoritative basis for your relationship with theEmperor both as regards the past and for the future. Although the position under International Law has not been changed you must disregard the last sentence of our telegram No. 65810 of 9/5.. 2. His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the re-appearance of an independentEthiopian State, but for the present the conduct of military operations requires that the Emperor must abide strictly by the advice of the British militaryauthorities.3. Ethiopia is temporarily under British military guidance and controlpending a further decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government.4. In areas notified by the Commander-in-Chief as areas occupied by british military Forces, and these may change from time to time as the military situationdemands, the political and administrative executive of the Commander-in-Chiefwill be the Deputy Chief Political Officer. Departmental control and adminis-trative supervision on behalf of the War Office and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill be exercised through the Chief Political Officer, thus such areas will be under british Military Administration.5. When the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, considers that military occupation of an area may be dispensed with, such an area will be placed underthe authority of the Emperor, it being understood that should the situationdemand, the Commander-in-Chief may require any such area to revert to purely british Administration. In administering these areas the Emperor must acceptBritish guidance and control. That guidance and control will be exercisedthrough the Deputy Chief Political Officer and his staff at the centre and by political missions attached to the Emperor&apos;s officials in the provinces. legislation in these areas will be in the name of the Emperor or under cover of hisproclamations but must be acceptable to the Deputy Chief Political Officer.6. Communications between the Emperor and His Majesty&apos;s Government willbe sent through the Deputy Chief Political Officer to General Officer Commandingwho will transmit to Commander-in-Chief through Chief Political Officer.
(b4j/66)   130- 6/41   w.o.p.   7873There are special problems affecting Tigre, the Ogaden, the Borana, and theIlembi triangle :(i) Tigre was detached from Ethiopia and included by the Italians inEritrea : its Ras (Seyyum) is the grandson of the Emperor Johnand has at least as good a claim to be Emperor as Haile Selassie;I believe, however, that he can be induced to come to terms with theEmperor and we should use our best efforts to that end. He may,however, seek a separate protectorate for Tigre, and refuse to rejoinEthiopia. If that should happen we must not use, or permit theEmperor to use, force but must take the line that the question is oneof internal Ethiopian politics, and must await the peace treaty. TheEmperor will certainly want to use coercion now. The attempt wouldmean serious civil war, in which I should not be surprised to findRas Hailu taking Ras Seyyum&apos;s side. Ras Haile Selassie Gugsacertainly would.(ii) The Ogaden is a fanatically Moslem Somali area lying S.E. of Ethiopiaproper^ and extending across the Webi Shebeli to the Tuba. It wasconquered by the Ethiopians about 50 years ago. The Italians veryrightly detached it and added it to Italian Somaliland. It is full of italian rifles, ammunition, and machine-guns and would undoubtedlyresist by force any attempt to restore Ethiopian rule. Moslem feeling is very alert about it and I have already had representations fromthe Rector of El Azhar Mosque through the Ambassador in Cairoabout the ill-treatment of Moslems by the (Christian) Ethiopians.I have placed the Ogaden under the Deputy Chief Political OfficerItalian Somaliland, and there it must remain until the peaceconference.(hi) The Borana is the Southern province along the Kenya border con-quered by Menelik forty years ago and used thereafter as a slaveraiding reserve. It contains about 30,000 Borana and is now adminis-tered by arrangement with the Government of Kenya in a jointfrontier administration the head of which answers for it direct tome. There is serious disorder, raiding and killing there which we areslowly getting under control. Restoration of Amharic rule now wouldresult in more bloodshed and probably a resumption of slaving, andwe must have control for some time longer.(iv) The Ilembi triangle is a fairly straightforward problem of turbulentfrontier administration. Adjustments are necessary but for thepresent there is no reason why in Ethiopia order should not be restored and maintained in the Emperor&apos;s name and with his troopswhen they have been trained, but British officers will have to bein charge.&quot; Ethiopia &quot; then means Ethiopia as it was in 1935, subject tothe special problems and reservations arising from the matters setout above, and modified territorially accordingly, as may benecessary.
