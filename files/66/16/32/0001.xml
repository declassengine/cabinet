The reports of operations in and around Crete are given on page 10.naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   The Mediterranean Fleet is engaged in operations off Crete.A German battleship has arrived at Bergen.Shipping losses during the week have been heavy.Home Waters.2. Two heavy ships and eleven merchant ships with air and surface escortswere reported proceeding northward through the Kattegat on the 20th and on the21st aircraft located a Bismarck-class battleship, a Hipper-class cruiser, a destroyer and 6 merchant ships at Bergen. In consequence of these movementsstrong naval forces have proceeded to the Iceland (C) area.The Finnish tanker Josefina Thorden (6,549 tons) was intercepted by our patrols on the 19th, and the Jussi H (2,323 tons) on the 20th, about 150 miles tothe west of the Faroes. The tanker was attacked by enemy aircraft six hours afterinterception and set on fire, but two days later the fire was out and she was takenin tow.Enemy aircraft Were shot down by H.M. Patrol Vessel Perspective off the humber and by H.M. Minesweeper Princess Elizabeth and four trawlers offHarwich.North Atlantic.3. The French tanker Sheherazade (13,467 tons), which had escaped from new Orleans on the 16th, 2 hours before U.S. guards were due to go on board,was intercepted by H.M.S. Diomede 800 miles East of Bermuda on the 21st. TheFrench schooner Izarra was intercepted on the 17th when 420 miles north of the azores.During the period 12 French merchant ships (42,000 tons) have passed gibraltar westbound and 7 (32,000 tons) eastbound.   All were under escort.Mediterranean.4. The Greek destroyers are now operating as local escorts from Alexandriaand the Greek submarines have been exercising with their own torpedo boats.H.M. Submarine Undaunted is overdue from patrol and must be con-sidered lost.H.M. Submarine Triumph bombarded Apollonia and also sank a 400-tonschooner in that area.H.M. Submarine Unbeaten attacked shipping to the east of Tripoli and sank a large schooner and damaged a smaller one by gunfire.H.M. Submarine Urge sank a 7,000-ton tanker and a 9,000-ton troopship ina south-bound convoy to the south-west of Malta on the 20th and on the 21stattacked two cruisers and 3 or 4 destroyers at long range, possibly sinking a destroyer.H.M. Gunboat Gnat bombarded Gazala on the night of the 7th/18th.H.M. Destroyer Encounter received further damage in an air raid on Maltaon the night of the 15th/16th, and H.M. Minesweeper Eernoy is now so badly damaged that she is to be broken up. HM. Corvette Gloxinia was damaged bya mine at Malta.During the air attacks on Crete (reported under the Cretan section) H.M.Corvette Salvia was damaged at Suda Bay on the 16th and H.M.S. York was again hit on the 18th. On the 20th H.M. Minesweeper Widnes and a smallauxiliary were damaged and beached.
Enemy Intelligence.German.7. The Scharnhorst and Gneisenau remain at Brest. On the 16th May a floating crane was working alongside the former. Air reconnaissance of Kiel onthe 18th May showed an 8-inch cruiser in dry dock and a pocket battleship,probably the Admiral Scheer, in the port. The 8-inch cruiser Seydlitz was still at Bremen.U-Boats.8. Up to 16 German and 4 Italian U-boats have been operating in theNorth-Western Approaches throughout the week. The majority of them havebeen disposed to the west of Iceland (C), with two or three to the south of iceland (C) and two north-west of the Hebrides. Up to five Germans have been working to the west and north-west of Freetown.Raiders.9. It is thought that the raider that sank H.M.S. Voltaire (Weekly ResumeNo. 85) returned to Germany sometime in April.There is probably one raider in the North Atlantic, one in the South atlantic and one or perhaps two in the Indian Ocean.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. Shipping losses during the period have been heavy. They have been mainly caused by U-boats, which made a heavy attack on a homeward-boundCanadian convoy about 300 miles south-east of Greenland, sank severalindependently-routed ships to the west of Freetown and inflicted a small numberof casualties on shipping in the North-Western Approaches.Aircraft have attacked convoys in the North-Western Approaches on two occasions and inflicted some casualties. In this area the S.S. Umgeni (8,160 tons)shot down a Focke-Wulf on the 19th and rescued five survivors.There have been few air attacks on coastal convoys, all unsuccessful. Therewere several casualties from an aircraft attack in the Mediterranean and two frommines in the Thames Estuary.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ended the 21st May, 904 ships, of which 154 wereAllied and 21 Neutrah were convoyed. One battleship, one cruiser, twelve armed merchant cruisers and ocean-boarding vessels, four submarines, 59 destroyers,66 sloops and corvettes and 7 ex-American coastguard-cutters have been employedon escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the17th May were 1,062,625 tons, compared with 891,156 tons during the previous[22541] b other Foreign Stations.5. H.M. New Zealand Minesweeper&apos;Puriri sank whilst sweeping in HaurakiGulf.  There were four casualties.H.M.S. Newcastle 300 miles south of St. Helena intercepted the FrenchLieutenant St. Loubert Bie (6,126 tons) on passage to Madagascar from Marseilleswith 1,700 Indo-Chinese troops.In Italian Somaliland, Guardafui Lighthouse was occupied by our forces and Tukom (10 miles South of Guardafui) surrendered on the 19th May.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. Nine attacks by surface craft and four by aircraft were made during theweek, some of which, almost certainly, were directed against the same submarine.In two instances quantities of oil were sighted on the surface at the end of the attack or series of attacks. These were in attacks carried out by air and surface craft on the 15th, 300 miles west of Ireland, and an attack made by ELM. DestroyerSt. Clair on the 20th, 400 miles west of Ireland.
week and an average of 737.293 tons for the past ten weeks. Twenty-eighttankers brought 306,636 tons of oil compared with 245,291 tons in 26 tankersbetween the 4th and 10th May. Mineral imports were 326,129 tons, of which260,316 tons were steel, pig-iron; scrap-iron and iron-ore. Timber imports were35,359 tons, and cereals 208,841 tons, 26 ships being fully laden with grain. other food imports amounted to 109,108 tons, of which the principal commodities, intons, were : sugar and molasses, 43,601; refrigerated and tinned meats, bacon and hams, 23,369; dried and tinned fruit (including a cargo of 8,282 tons of currants),9,982; cocoa, 8,298; butter, 4,184; tea, 1,887; and jam, 1,367. Three consign-ments of tobacco totalled 1,299 tons, and among large imports of machinery were1,772 tons of machine tools.British Minelaying.12. On the 16th May, H.M. Ships Teviot Bank and Plover laid 370 mines in the East. Coast area, and H.M. Ships A gamemnon, Menestheus and Port Quebeclaid 1,490 mines in the Iceland (C)-Faroes Channel.Minelaying by aircraft has continued, though not on any great scale, chieflyoff the French Channel and Biscay Ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.13. Enemy aircraft have carried out minelaying operations off our coastsevery night this week, chiefly on the east coast from the Humber to the thames estuary and off Falmouth.Six magnetic mines and 12 acoustic mines have been detonated during theweek and one mine has been counter-mined in the Clyde. Seven contact mines have been swept in the Falmouth field and one contact mine has been sweptabout 31 miles east of Orfordness. The mine totals, including those dealt within foreign waters, are now : acoustic 610, magnetic 1,151, contact 872.Foreign Waters.14. During the night of the 17th/18th May minelaying aircraft raided the suez Canal, and six mines were dropped in the vicinity of Kantara, while about20 bombs or mines exploded in the Canal or on the shore. The position of the mines were all marked. Two minelaying aircraft were shot down. Traffic isstopped in the northern section, but it is hoped to resume it shortly. Severalobjects suspected to be mines were dropped off the Grand Harbour entrance ofValletta, Malta, during the night of the 14th/15th May. No report of minesswept since this raid has so far been received. New searched approach channelshave been established for the two Valletta harbours.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.15. Photographs taken of Bordeaux during the last week confirm the reportthat the Portland, 7,132 tons, had arrived at Bordeaux from Talcahuane.The Ithaka, 1,773 tons, and the Cordelia, 1,357 tons, with the Eoumaniantanker Campina, 3,032 tons, entered the Bosporus on the 14th bound for the aegean and were met off the Dardanelles by two seaplanes and one aeroplane.The Campina is under German control and was fully loaded with 3,800 tons ofpetroleum. The Ithaka was loaded with ammunition and the Cordelia withgrain. The Yalova left Chanak for Mitylene on the 15th May, and her cargowas said to be food-stuffs. The Arkadia, 1,756 tons, is reported to have had a cargo of 6,100 bombs and a large number of small rubber boats when she passedIstanbul on the 8th May bound for the iEgean. The Bulgarian Tzar Ferdinand,1,994 tons, passed Istanbul bound for the Black Sea on the 20th May.Italian.16. The Pier Luigi, 2,571 tons, which has been chartered by a Germanfirm, passed Istanbul and Chanak on the 15th and 16th May respectively, bound for Greece, and is reported to have a cargo of 4,000 tons of grain.   The Caterina
Madre, 4,020 tons, also German controlled, passed through the Bosporus on 19thMay, bound for Salonika, with 5,850 tons of Wheat. The tanker GiuseppinaGhirardi, 3,319 tons, with 5,000 tons of benzine, passed through the Bosporus Orf19th May, bound for Greece. The agents of the Capo Arma, 3,175 tons, alsounder German control, have produced a bank guarantee for the debt due to the shell Company, for which the ship had been sequestered at Istanbul; she has been released and sailed on 20th May for Braila.The tankers Arcola, 6,349 tons, and Todaro, 5,162 tons, are reported to beloading at Teneriffe and to intend leaving on 20th May.The Duchessa D&apos;A osta, 7,872 tons, which is at Fernando Po, in the Gulf ofGuinea, is believed to be in wireless communication with Europe and transmittinginformation about the movements of allied shipping.French Intelligence.17. The disposition of the main units of the French Fleet is :largelyunchanged. The bulk of them are at Toulon, whilst there are light forces sanddamaged capital ships at the North African ports, Casablanca and Dakar.It is reported that at Dakar the caissons have been removed from the battle-ship Richelieu, but that divers are still at work on her. At Toulon a system of&apos;&apos; gardiennage&apos;&apos; has been instituted for all but a force consisting of the battle-cruiser Strasbourg, three 8-inch cruisers, two 6-inch cruisers, the aircraft carrierand certain small craft, which are kept at short notice. Under this system theships are maintained ready for sea, partly fuelled and with ammunition, butprovided with reduced civilian crews.Reports of the state of opinion in the French Fleet suggest that it is nowless anti-British than was formerly reported, and is certainly very anti-German,except for a number of over politically minded officers. .    &apos;MILITARY SITUATION.Operations.Note. The military operations in Crete are shown in paragraphs 71-75.Egypt and Libya.18. On the 15th of May, simultaneous offensive operations were carried outby our troops in the Sollum-Sofafi area and by the Tobruk garrison.19. The former operation gained considerable initial success and ourleading elements penetrated as far as Fort Capuzzo, seven miles west of Sollum.Later in the day an enemy counter-attack, supported by about 40 medium and heavy tanks, necessitated a withdrawal to positions in the Sidi Suleiman-Half ay aarea with forward posts in Sollum. Heavy casualties in personnel and A.F.V.&apos;were inflicted on the enemy and 500 prisoners were taken.On the 18th of May the enemy attempted an advance eastwards towardsHalfaya and Sidi Suleiman with a force which included 70 tanks. The southernflank of this force was attacked) by our armoured troops and the enemy withdrewlater in the day.20. The operations in the Tobruk area took the form of an,advance by ourfighting patrols and tanks in the Medawar salient, the western extremity of the defensive perimeter, a position which was recently occupied by the enemy. Theenemy counter-attacked vigorously during the following night and recoveredsome of the ground which he had lost, but by the 16th of May our position in the salient had been consolidated with an average gain of about 600 yards.Casualties have not yet been fully assessed, but it is believed that in all these operations the balance is in our favour.A abyssinia.21. On the 16th of May, emissaries from the Duke of Aosta, commanding the Italian forces in East Africa, arrived at the headquarters of our troopsinvesting the Amba Alagi position to ask for terms of surrender for himself andthe garrison. The formal surrender of the Amba Algai garrison numbering about,000 took place on the 19th of May and the Duke of Aosta and his staffsurrendered on the following day.
22. Operations against the remaining Italian forces concentrated aboutGondar and Gimma and in the lake area of Southern Abyssinia are proceedingsteadily, although hampered by bad weather,Iraq.23. A council of fair standing under local Sheikhs has been established atBasra for local administration. The situation there remains quiet and policeposts 25 miles south of the city have been occupied without incident.24. The progress of our advance columns from Palestine was delayed owingto soft going, the leading troops reaching El Majora, south of Lake Habbaniyahon 16th May, where they were met by armoured cars and have now arrived atHabbaniyah.On the night of the 18th/19th May our troops entered Falluja withoutcasualties.  The bridge across the Tigris at this point was found to be undamaged.Far East.25. Lieutenant-General A. E. Percival, D.S.O., O.B.E., M.C., assumedcommand Malaya on 16th May.2/15 Punjab Regiment has arrived in Borneo from Singapore.Intelligence.Germany.26. Several sources confirm the strengthening of German forces along theRussian frontier in North Norway, East Prussia and South Poland, and armyformations which are being withdrawn from the Balkans may well be destined for Poland.27. At the same time there are several reports which hint at a rapproche-ment between the two countries. Some of these suggest that German threatshave been successful, and that arrangements for German control of the despatchof supplies from Russia have been accepted by the latter country.28. German propaganda, which recently was spreading rumours of war, isnow stressing closer co-operation. Two reports state that Hitler has not finally decided whether to obtain his wishes by persuasion or by force of arms, andanother indicates that the latter alternative will be chosen if the former does not give results by the end of M.&amp;y.Norway.29. The number of German troops reported to have arrived recently inKirkenes and North Norway amounts to the equivalent of one division.Movements of German transports from Baltic ports since the beginning of Maytend to suggest that the German garrison in Norway and Finland is being furtherreinforced.Spain.30. Reports have been received of the presence of German troops at Pau,the reconnaissance unit of an armoured division being mentioned .One report suggests that Germany&apos;s intention in S.W. Europe is to neutralizeGibraltar by gaining command of the Straits from the Spanish and the Africancoasts, rather than to attempt its capture.Morocco.31. Small parties of German &quot; tourists &quot; are still filtering into the interiorof the French and Spanish Zones of Morocco and intensifying their propagandaamong the Moors. There have also been reports of similar parties at one or two points in West Africa.Turkey. .32. It is reported that certain Germans in Iran with an intimate knowledgeof Turkey were ordered on the 13th May to leave for Turkey within 48 hours.
33. The German occupation of several of the Greek islands in the EasternJEgiean constitutes a serious threat to Turkey, which would be intensified if thepresent attack on Crete proved successful.Syria.34. There now seems little doubt that the landing in Syria, of german aircraft and the passage from Syria through Turkey of arms and ammunition for the Iraqi rebels were achieved with the full knowledge of the French HighCommissioner and at the.behest of Vichy. Fearing retaliation by us when the news leaked out, French troops were moved towards the Palestine and Iraqfrontiers and A.A. defences around the principal towns and aerodromes were fully manned. It is now clear that General Dentz and the majority of the french in Syria will remain loyal to Vichy.35. There are reports of an agreement between France and Germany,covering facilities at ports and air bases, whereby the French will withdraw tothe Lebanon area, leaving Germany a free hand in the rest of the country. German&quot; tourists &quot; are daily expected in large numbers and there are rumours of the imminent arrival of a German Military Mission.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. During the week there was a decrease in the number of day and night operations carried out by Bomber Command owing to unfavourable weather con-ditions.  The night effort of the enemy was also on a much reduced scale.Syrian aerodromes used by the German Air Force have been heavily attacked by our aircraft.Germany and Occupied Territory.General.37. During the week Bomber Command flew 74 day and 448 night sorties,which is a decrease in both day and night operations compared with the previousweek. Weather conditions deteriorated during the latter part of the period under review and caused projected operations to be cancelled on three nights, andcurtailed on the fourth night.Day.38. With the exception of successful attacks on Gosnay, near Bethune, andon Heligoland, all our daylight operations were concentrated against enemy shipping and are reported under Coastal Operations. The attack on Gosnaywas directed against the Power Station and Benzol Plant, direct hits being scoredon both objectives causing clouds of steam and smoke at the former and volumesof smoke from the latter. Photographs confirm this. Thirteen squadrons of fighters were engaged in escorting our bombers and covering their withdrawal.Numerous combats ensued and we lost six fighters, and one bomber; five enemy fighters were destroyed and eight more damaged. On the same day the naval base of Heligoland was subjected to a surprise attack carried out from heightsof 40 to 50 feet, in the face of intense anti-aircraft gunfire. Explosions were seen in the centre of the town&quot; from which a mass of smoke and flame resulted.One of our bombers did not return.Night.39. On the first four nights of the week aircraft of Bomber Commandcarried out moderately heavy attacks against the Industrial centres at Cologne(on two consecutive nights), Hanover and the naval shipbuilding yards at Kiel.Attacks on a lighter scale were made on Boulogne, Dieppe, Eotterdam and anumber of secondary targets. Three Manchesters and two Stirlings bombed theindustrial centre of Berlin on the night of the 15th /16th. Apart from many large fires seen through gaps in the cloud, results were obscured by indifferent visibilityand searchlight dazzle.   Some indication of the effect of these attacks may, how-
ever, be gauged from the weight of bombs dropped in the target areas. Colognereceived 178 tons of High Explosive bombs and 25,500 incendiary bombs; Hanover,86 tons of H.E. and 10,500 incendiary bombs; Kiel, 50 tons of H.E. and 2,300incendiary bombs, while 15 tons of H.E. were dropped on Berlin.40. Coastal Command aircraft on two nights bombed the docks atWillemsoord and Dieppe. Other attacks were made on the E-boat base atIjmuiden, U-boats at St. Nazaire and destroyers at La Pallice, in addition to small raids on invasion ports and on aerodromes near Brest. Bombs were seen inmost instances to explode in the target areas, but accurate observation was difficultowing to weather conditions.- Fighter  Command  despatched  offensive  sorties  against  aerodromes  inNorthern France on two nights.United Kingdom.41. Fighter Command flew 1,171 patrols involving 3,177 sorties by day and669 sorties were flown by night. There was a slight increase in the daylighteffort of the enemy. By night, however, there was a considerable decrease, only290 long-range bombers being employed as compared with 1,070 in the precedingweek, although adverse weather conditions prevailed on three nights only.42. By day, the usual enemy reconnaissances and patrols were flown, and again there were a few offensive daylight sweeps by small formations over Kent.Hawkinge aerodrome was machine-gunned three times on the 16th May by oneof these formations. During the week our fighters destroyed at least fifteenaircraft engaged in these operations, and A.A. guns destroyed three others. Welost seven aircraft, but three pilots were saved.43. By night, there were no sustained or concentrated bombing attacks onthis country. The heaviest attack was made on the night of the 16th/17th May,when about 140 aircraft made a widespread attack on the Midlands. three enemy night bombers were destroyed during the week. We lost two Beaufighters,but the crews are safe.Coastal Operations.44. Coastal Command flew 252 patrols and provided escorts for 107 convoys,involving a total of 821 sorties. Shipping protection patrols carried out by fighter Command totalled 886 and involved 1,849 sorties.45. Enemy coastal shipping was subjected to a number of attacks, by aircraft of Bomber Command and Coastal Command, in the course of whichBlenheims of the former Command sank a 2,500-ton merchant vessel off Bergen.46. Eighteen successful minelaying sorties were flown during the week, ofwhich twelve were carried out by aircraft of Coastal Command. An average ofabout 18 enemy minelaying aircraft was plotted on six nights, operating princi-pally between the Thames Estuary and the Humber and in Liverpool Bay and of four South-Western coasts..47. Aircraft of the Condor unit carried out two dawn attacks on shippingNorth-West of Ireland and other units were similarly engaged at night off theEast Coasts of England and Scotland, East of Dublin and South-West of Wales.During daylight Me. 109&apos;s made two attacks on shipping off the South Coast.48. Enemy bomber reconnaissance aircraft continued their routine patrolsover our coastal areas and the North Sea.Malta.49. Enemy aircraft made six attacks on Malta during the week, but our fighters were unable to intercept. Luqa aerodrome was again the main target andwas attacked twice on the 20th and once on the 21st May by large formations ofGerman aircraft. Three of our aircraft on the ground were burnt out and others were damaged. Some damage was also done to the aerodrome buildings. Takaliand Halfar aerodromes were also attacked, but only slight damage was caused.
- 50. On the night of the 15th/16th the Grand Harbour was attacked byeight German aircraft, and Valetta was bombed twice during the week, somecivilian &apos;property being demolished.51. Several reconnaissances of the Tunisian and Sicilian coasts and of theIonian Sea were flown by our Maryland aircraft.Crete and Eastern Mediterranean.52. A report of the operations in Crete are described in paragraphs 71 to 75of this Resume.53. Our aircraft have continued to make heavy attacks on aerodromes in greece used by the enemy as bases for air attacks on Crete. On the night of the16th/17th May seventeen Wellingtons from Egypt heavily attacked the aerodromes at Malaoi and at Argos. Four aircraft were destroyed at the formerand large fires were started at the latter. Two nights lateryseven Wellingtonsattacked successfully the aerodromes at Hassani and Eleusisfand on the night ofthe 20th/21st ten Wellingtons heavily bombed the aerodromes at Molaoi, Eleusis,Menidi and Toplia.54. On the night of the 17th/18th May a Wellington bombed Calatoaerodrome (Rhodes) and started several small fires.55. On the 15th, eight Italian aircraft bombed Nicosia (Cyprus), but causedno service damage or casualties.Egypt and Libya.56. Benghazi Harbour was heavily bombed by our aircraft three timesduring the week and much damage was done to buildings near the Mole.57. Attacks on enemy aerodromes were continued. Hurricanes destroyed two Me. 109&apos;s on the ground at Gazala; at Derna eight Wellingtons and twoBlenheims dropped bombs on a large concentration of enemy aircraft and on thehangars. The Barracks and aircraft at Apollonia were also successfullymachine-gunned.58. Several successful attacks were made on enemy supply columns. Onthe 16th May Hurricanes and Blenheim fighters machine-gunned a convoy ofone hundred large M.T. vehicles between Barce and Derna, destroying several ofthem, and on the 19th a Hurricane set fire to vehicles which were conveying troopsbetween Derna and Bardia.59. About thirty enemy aircraft attacked the harbour and the waterdistillery at Tobruk on the 17th without causing damage or casualties. the suez Canal near Port Said was attacked by Ju. 88&apos;s and He. lll&apos;s on the night of the 17th/18th May, when about fifty mines or bombs were dropped, thirty ofwhich failed to explode. Low machine-gun attacks were also made. No damage or casualties are reported, but three enemy aircraft were destroyed.Palestine and Syria.60. German aircraft proceeding to Iraq have continued to make use ofSyrian aerodromes.: 61. Our aircraft heavily attacked enemy aircraft on the aerodromes atPalmyra, Rayak and Damascus. A He. Ill and a large transport aircraft were set on fire at Palmyra, and the runway at Rayak was damaged.62. Our aircraft which were engaged on these operations were fired on inthe Damascus, Aleppo, Beirut and Rayak areas, and attempts were made by french fighter aircraft to intercept.[22541] c
Iraq.63. Our aircraft have continued their attacks on aerodromes and barracks.In the attack on the hangars at Rashid on the 20th May thirteen direct hits were obtained, and in the attack on Mosul aerodrome by Blenheim fighters on 16th/17thMay two enemy aircraft on the ground were set on fire and others were damaged by machine-gun attack.  An extensive fire was also started.64. Standing patrols were maintained by our aircraft over Habbaniya andFallujah. Iraqi troops at Fallujah were attacked by our bombers on the 19th andpamphlets were dropped demanding surrender. On the same day a column ofBritish troops was landed to the east of the town by Valentias and Douglasaircraft.65. A number of German aircraft have arrived in Iraq. Two Me. 110&apos;were shot down over Rashid on the 17th May. On the 16th and 20th He. lll&apos;sand Me. 110&apos;s attacked Habbaniya aerodrome, where the engine repair depot was set on fire and some damage was caused to our aircraft.66.   The Iraqi Air Force have not been in action since the 7th May.Abyssinia.67. During the week our aircraft attacked enemy positions at Gondar andat Chilga, near Lake Tana, and aerodromes at Azazo and Gimma. Attacks were also made on motor transport and armoured fighter vehicles between Chilga andGondar and near Dalle, several direct hits being scored.General Air Intelligence. 1Syria.68. It is reported that the defences of Syrian Aerodromes are being improved and that troops are standing-to in anticipation of a British attempt to take overcontrol of Syria.69. The two train loads of arms which left Aleppo on the 11th May havearrived in Iraq, and these arms are believed to be now in the hands of the Iraqirebels.70. Meanwhile, the infiltration of German &quot; tourists &quot; into Syria continuesand 200 are reported to be expected to arrive shortly at Beirut.CRETE.71. After a week of considerable air activity, during which our aircraftmade a number of heavy attacks on aerodromes in Greece used by the Germansas bases for air attacks on Crete, a large number of enemy aircraft on the19th May made heavy bombing and machine-gun attacks on the Maleme, Canea,Heraklion and Suda Bay areas.72. On the 18th May, Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, and GeneralFreyberg had decided to withdraw the remaining aircraft, as experience in greece had shown the impossibility of operating them without adequate A.A.protection in the face of a heavy scale of air attack. Conditions in Crete wereeven more unfavourable as there were no facilities for dispersal, and aerodromedefences were insufficient.73. In the morning of the 20th May enemy air attacks were continued and at 0800 German air-borne troops had been landed south and south-west ofCanea. At 1100 approximately 1,500 enemy troops wearing New Zealand battledress landed by gliders, parachutes and troop carriers in the Canea and Malemeareas. By the afternoon most of them had been mopped up, but a fairly strongenemy party south of the Canea-Maleme road had not been accounted for.During the afternoon parachute troops wearing English battle dress landed inHeraklion town, on the aerodrome and in the Candia area.
74. On the 21st of May, the situation at Heraklion was obscure, but thetown and harbour were partly occupied by the enemy, who had mounted machine guns on the mole. In the Retinio Sector an attack on the aerodrome at 0300 was successfully withstood. During the morning in the Maleme area a heavy air attack forced our troops to withdraw east of the aerodrome. According to alater report the aerodrome and the area west of it were held by the enemy, butelsewhere the coast line was in our hands. Landings of parachute troops S.W.of Canea at 1515 were heavily engaged by our artillery and machine-gun fire.During the week the garrison of Crete had been reinforced by 2nd Leicesters,6 &quot; I &quot; tanks, 16 light tanks, 18 A A. guns, 17 field guns, and on the 18th and19th May a further battalion with 14 days&apos; supplies, together with 3 &quot; I &quot; tanks,and stores were landed at Mesara Bay.75. Strong forces of the Mediterranean Fleet had been operating in thevicinity of the island for some days, and on the night of the 20th cruisers and destroyers patrolled the north coast but without result. They retired to the southward during daylight on the 21st, and the destroyers refuelled. ELM.destroyer Juno was sunk by bombs in this area about noon. On the afternoon ofthe 21st five convoys of merchant ships and fishing vessels, two of them escorted by destroyers, were reported steering towards Crete from the islands to the north.Cruisers and destroyers were ordered to intercept, and during the night sank anenemy destroyer, two merchant ships and a number of caiques.

The roofs were set on fire and in some cases premises were burnt out on the top and second floors.   No serious attempts were made for about an
hour to deal with incendiaries which fell in the roadway. H.E. bombs fell on a school and a theatre near the Reichstag; another fell on a bank building in theMittelstrasse, which was entirely destroyed, and another fell in the HausvogteiPlatz (in which the Reichbank is situated), completely destroying a six-storeytailoring establishment. A delay-action bomb in the Mittelstrasse went off at in the afternoon of the 10th, and in the Lichtenberg district 482 flats had hadto be evacuated. A further report concerning the&quot; new bomb&quot; which was dropped on the 17th/18th April states that practically every window within halfa mile was broken and within 250 yards roofs had been lifted off and all windowframes and doors blown in.An informant present on the 18th/19th April observed repair workproceeding at both the Anhalter and Stettiner Stations. One corner of theFriedrichstrasse Station has been hit and the Winter Palace Music Hall nearbyhas closed down, all its windows having been blown out.Mannheim.

As a result of the attacks on the 8th/9th, 10th/11th and11th/12th May nearly every part of the city has suffered, and in particular thedistrict surrounding the station. The bombs used had great explosive effect andthe city is said to present a tragic picture.

The outer harbour railway station has received threedirect hits and the railway sheds lying to the North and South thereof fourdirect hits. A power station to the North-West has been hit on two occasions,causing a complete stoppage for two days each time.General. Reliable informants state that the German people are impressed with the recent scale and weight of R.A.F. attacks, which are stated to be highly successful. In Kiel, Mannheim and Hamburg the authorities have no longerbeen able to prevent the inhabitants knowing the extent of the damage. Manyrumours are current in Germany about the terrific effect of the latest Britishbombs.France.Brest-In the raid on the 4th/5th May the Gneisenau received further serious damage from a direct hit. It is said that both battle cruisers havereceived damage that will necessitate at least two months&apos; repair work.Norway.In the attack on the aerodrome at Sola on the night of the 5th/6th May twobarracks were destroyed and two damaged by incendiary bombs.

Eight aircraft in the hangar were damaged.The following information of damage has been received from Prisoner ofWar Sources and should be treated with reserve : Berlin. A P/W who visited Berlin in March stated that, in his opinion,raid damage was much more serious than had been admitted in official com-muniques.   A German officer, who was in Berlin about the same time, declared
that the R.A.F. could be expected to arrive punctually about 2300 hours. shortly before this, all cafes and places of amusement were closed and trams and buseswere crammed with people hurrying home.Bremen. Heavy damage is reported to have been caused to the Focke-Wulfaircraft factory and 300 Kondor wings are said to have been destroyed. A large part of Germany&apos;s remaining stocks of coffee was stored in warehouses at Bremenwhich were hit and set on fire last January. The population of Bremen and hamburg are becoming increasingly nervous and dissatisfied, and are unable towork properly owing to lack of sleep. Although much overtime is worked, and wages are higher than ever before, this confers little advantage owing to lack ofgoods available for purchase.Wilhelmshaven. It is reported that entire roads have been destroyed, theJackmann bridge and the street leading to it have disappeared, and theKonigstrasse, the Roonstrasse, and a swing bridge have been damaged.
