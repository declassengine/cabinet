General Review.Cruisers and destroyers of the Mediterranean Fleet have been engaged inthe evacuation of our military forces from Crete.The German cruiser Prinz Eugen has been located at Brest.Shipping losses have been about the average.Home and Atlantic.2. The German cruiser Prinz Eugen, which was last seen in company withthe battleship Bismarck during the evening of the 24th May, was not again locateduntil noon on the 4th June, when an air reconnaissance showed her in dry dockat Brest. During the intervening period H.M. Ships Repulse and Suffolk, aftersearching an area to south-west of Greenland for possible supply ships, proceeded to reinforce ocean escorts for convoys sailing from Halifax, while H.M. CruisersAurora and Kenya continued on patrol to southward of Greenland. Patrols bycruisers and armed merchant cruisers have been maintained in the DenmarkStrait, to south-eastward of Iceland and in mid-Atlantic between the West indies and Freetown.3. During the night of the 4th/5th a trawler on patrol intercepted theFinnish s.s. Modesta (3,830 tons) and sent her into Kirkwall under armed guard.Single enemy aircraft were shot down by H.M. Destroyer Tartar to the westward of Ireland, by H.M. Trawler Chiltern off Plymouth and by H.M.Trawler Northern Sky to the north-west of the Hebrides.During the period two escorted French merchant ships (6,825 tons) have passed Gibraltar westbound and five (upwards of 8,531 tons) eastbound.Casualties to H.M. Auxiliary vessels are given in Appendix V.Mediterranean.4. Note. Operations in the vicinity of Crete have been dealt with under&quot; Military Situation.&quot;H.M. Australian destroyers Vendetta and Waterhen have continued to transport personnel, supplies &apos; and ammunition into Tobruk during hours ofdarkness. Enemy shelling of Tobruk and the harbour has been intensified sincethe 2nd June.Two M.T.B.&apos;s and a squadron of Swordfish aircraft are operating fromFamagusta (Cyprus).West Indies.5. During the night of the lst/2nd June the Dutch cruiser Van Kinsbergenintercepted to the eastward of Antigua the French s.s. Arica (5,390 tons) boundeastwards from Martinique and escorted her to Trinidad.Enemy Shipping Losses.6. Approximately 21,200 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by aircraft of the Coastal and Bomber Command. Of this total, 13,000 tons werein the Mediterranean and 8,200 tons in the Home Waters. Details of attacks aregiven in the Air Section.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. There have been eight attacks on TJ-Boats during the week. Four of these were by surface vessels and four by aircraft. Of these, three were to the 1southward of Iceland (c), two were to the westward of Gibraltar, two were in Ithe North-Western Approaches, and one was off the Gironde. No definite results iwere obtained. Aircraft also carried out six hunts for TJ-Boats, but these were Iunsuccessful.
Enemy Intelligence.German.8. Reconnaissance of Kiel showed that the battleship Tirpitz had left the floating clock and was alongside on the 30th May, but had sailed by the 3rd June.The pocket battleship Admiral Scheer was also seen alongside and the 8-inch cruiser Hipper in dry dock. The Pocket Battleship Lutzow is reported to havebeen at Swinemunde and the cruisers Kola. and Emden at Gdynia on the14th May. It is believed that except for the ships at Brest the remaining enemymain units are in the Baltic. Reconnaissance of Brest at 1250 on the 4th Juneshowed that the new 8-inch cruiser Prinz Eugen was in the eastern dry dock.Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were in their usual positions.Italian.9. No change has been reported in the position of main units. A larger number of cruisers has been employed in escorting convoys between Sicily and north Africa.U^Boats.10. The Germans have maintained some fifteen U-Boats in the North-Western Approaches throughout the period under review. The majority havebeen w^ell out to the westward in the area, to the south-east of Greenland west of350 W., but two or three have torpedoed ships in a more easterly area to the southward of 50o N., about 700-1,000 miles west of Ushant. Though there havebeen one or two Italians in the North-Western Approaches, their main concen-tration has been to the westward of Gibraltar. In the southern area the germans have maintained four or more submarines between Cape Verde and the Equator,of which three have been working within 200 miles of Freetown. A german-Boat has also operated off St. Vincent, Cape Verde Islands, and one has alsovisited Accra.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. During the period the greater part of shipping losses from torpedo attackhas occurred in the Cape Verde Islands to Freetown area and a ship was sunkwhile at anchor off Accra (Gold Coast). Other losses were sustained to the westward of Gibraltar. In the North-Western Approaches casualties have beenexceptionally light, as also have been losses from mine. Only slight losses weresustained by coastal convoys although they were attacked on six occasions by aircraft off the East Coast between Dover and Cape Wrath.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. During the week ending 4th June, 903 ships, of which 150 were allied and 14 neutral, were convoyed.. Three battleships, one battle cruiser, two cruisers,ten armed merchant cruisers, two submarines, 55 destroyers and 58 sloops and corvettes have been employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending 31stMay again exceeded 1,000,000. The figure was 1,008,485 tons compared with664,736 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 742,130 tons duringthe past ten weeks. Oil imports, in 31 tankers, totalled 331.217 tons comparedwith 133,559 tons in 14 tankers during the seven days ending 24th May. mineral imports were 157,997 tons, of which 101,337 tons were steel, pig iron, scrap ironand iron ore. Timber imports were 38,759 tons, and flour and cereal imports were 244,269 tons. Twenty-seven ships were fully laden with grain. Other food imports were also most satisfactory, the total being 163,511 tons, comparedwith only 22,434 tons during the previous week. The principal imports were :sugar and molasses 63,835 tons, refrigerated and tinned meat, bacon and hams28,491 tons, butter 13.887 tons, tinned and dried fruit 11,140 tons, cheese 6,889-tons, cocoa 1,890 tons and eggs 1,692 tons. Tobacco imports totalled 1,203 tons.There were large quantities of ammunition and war stores, and amongmanufactured goods were 2,541 tons of machine-tools.
British Minelaying.13. The only minelaying operations for the period under review have beenin the East Coast Bar rier, where H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 270 mines on the1st June and H.M.S Plover 100 on the same day. There has been some slightminelaying activity by aircraft in the Central Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.- 14. Enemy aircraft have not laid mines on an extensive scale in any area.Liverpool Bay has been visited on four nights during the week, the bristol channel and the Thames Estuary have each had one raid and the Humberthree raids.There has been only one casualty due to enemy mines in Home Waters duringthe period under review.Two contact mines have been cut in the Falmouth minefield. Only eightmagnetic mines and six acoustic mines have been detonated during the week, andthe mine totals are magnetic 1,174, acoustic 633, contact 874.Foreign Waters.Minelaying aircraft raided Alexandria during the nights of the 30th and31st May.   The port was closed for a time, but was reopened at 0100/1st June.Shipping is at present proceeding normally through the Suez Canal.Malta was reopened on the 1st June, having been closed since the 7th May.A searched channel about eighty miles long has been established forMassawa, Eritrea.At least six ex-Norwegian whale catchers now in South American ports willbe sent to India and Colombo for conversion to LL Sweep for service in theMediterranean.Enemy Merchant Shipping. -German.15. The Flans Arp, 2,645 tons, arrived at Trieste on 24th May with a cargo ofbauxite from Yugoslavia. A report has been received stating that Bulgarian and greek ships in Turkish ports will be chartered by the German Government andwill operate under their own flags. The Carissa, 1,819 tons, Ithaka, 1,773 tons,and Norburg, 2,392 tons, are all reported to have been sunk. None of them havebeen reported since they reached the iEgean in the middle of May. The Windhuk,16,662 tons, has received her clearance papers and was said to be sailing fromSantos on 4th June, but may be detained by the Brazilian authorities.Italian.16. There is now evidence to show that the Conte Rosso, 17,879 tons, was thelarge liner sunk by H.M.S. Upholder on 24th May. The Florida II, 3,313 tons,. with a cargo of phosphates, was hit by three bombs and set on fire when attacked by Blenheims on 31st May about 4 miles east of Sfax. The French tanker Massis,5,022 tons, is said to have been sold on 10th May at Sete and transferred to theItalian flag. Another French tanker, the Roussillon, 9,967 tons, is also believed to have been transferred to Italy.There is considerable activity among Italian ships in Brazil.Economic Warfare.17. During the month of May 3,548 tons of cargo destined for the enemy wereseized in prize, the main items being 2,600 tons of foodstuffs and beverages and631 tons, of textiles which were almost entirely from French ships. Two packetsof diamonds valued at over  20,000 were also seized last month as contraband.The total seizures since the beginning of the war to the end of May amountto 784,759 tons.
Crete.MILITARY SITUATION.18. On the night of the 26th/27th May our position in the Maleme-Sudaarea was broken, and on the next day the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,ordered evacuation.19. The Headquarters were moved to Sphakia on the night of the27th/28th, and subsequently evacuation was carried out from there andHeraklion.20. The main body embarked in cruisers and destroyers from Sphakiaduring the nights of the 29th, 30th and 31st and about 17,000 troops, of whom 500were casualties and 250 prisoners of war, were landed at Alexandria, about 5,500being left at Sphakia and about 2,000 at Retimo. In the withdrawal from SudaBay the Royal Marines of the base defence organisation were formed into arearguard.21. During the evacuation air operations over Crete were mainly directed towards the reduction of the scale of German air attack on our navaL forces.Attacks were carried out against aerodromes in Rhodes and Scarpanto in the dodecanese, and at Heraklion and Maleme in Crete. Fighters provided coverduring the passage of the ships to Alexandria. At least thirteen, probably twenty,enemy aircraft were destroyed by fighters, while a considerable number were shot down and damaged by anti-aircraft fire from H.M. Ships. Supplies were alsodropped on our troops at Sphakia.22. In addition to the casualties to H.M. Ships reported last week,H.M.S. Calcutta and H.M. Destroyers Imperial and Hereward were sunk, and h.M.S. Orion and H.M. Destroyer Napier were damaged. Casualties to naval personnel are reported to total 100 officers and 1,700 ratings.23. The total number of German forces employed against Crete is difficultto estimate. It is thought that about 6.000 parachute troops were landed, ofwhich about 2,000 were in the Maleme-Canea area, 1,500 at Retimo and 2,500near Heraklion followed by about 11,000 -airborne troops, of which all but asmall number at Heraklion were landed at Maleme or on adjacent beaches.Further details may alter this figure, but a total of 17,000 parachute and air-borne troops is regarded as a minimum estimate.   (See map at end.)Egypt and Libya.24. After the enemy counter-attack reported in last week&apos;s Resume hadregained the ground they lost on the 15th May the situation has crystallised andremains comparatively static in the Tobruk and Western Desert forward areas.On the night of the 26th May our troOps in Tobruk made a further small advanceagainst the enemy salient and consolidated their new positions.Enemy long-range shelling, both at Tobruk and in the Sollum area, has beena feature of this period.25. During the past few weeks reinforcement of Libya on a considerable scale has been undertaken by the Italians. During the past two months two army corps and at least one division have been reconstituted and the Conte Rosso,recently torpedoed, was reported to have a large Italian force on board. in libya itself there has lately been an eastward movement of Italian divisionsformerly stationed between Zuara and Misurata, and there is now no completedivision between these two places, a distance of 235 miles. During the past month no important German reinforcements appear to have been sent to Libya.Abyssinia.26. The roads from Dessye to Gondar and to Assab have both been foundblocked and work is proceeding to clear them.Patriots have been active in the Lechemti area and have cut the Baco-Lechemti road to the north of Gimma : on the 30th May they captured an enemyadvance post at Billo, 40 miles south-east of Lechemti.
27. On the 28th May. in the Gondar area a further advance was made andour troops are now south of Debarech. During this operation, the patriotcasualties were 150: the enemy lost 400 dead. The Gondar-Debra Tabor roadhas been cut. - . ,28. On the 27th May General Cafarati surrendered to our forces in theSoddu area. In spite of heavy rains, mine-fields and demolitions, our ,troops havereached the bridge across the &quot;River Omo on the Soddu-Grimma road : the enemyhave retired across the river, and are holding a strong position on the west bank,from which they cover the bridge. A small bridgehead was established. on the2nd June.   The river, 100 yards wide, is running fast, and crossing is difficult.Remnants of an Italian division located 10 miles south-west of Soddu have refused to surrender, and steps are being taken to cut off their retreat.Iraq.29. On the 28th May the infantry brigade operating from Basra reachedUr, and on the 2nd June Al Khiclhr (50 miles further N.W.). The roads in this area are flooded and unfit for Motor Transport. On the 3rd June Iraqi troops at Qurha retired on orders from Baghdad.30. Two columns from ITabforce reached the outskirts of Baghdad on the30th May. In the meantime, Rashid Ali and his Cabinet having fled to Iran,a Committee of four under the Lord Mayor asked for an immediate armistice,which was granted. There was some rioting which was quelled by Iraqi troops from Kirkuk.   Our troops moved into Baghdad on the 2nd June.Small British mobile columns and air-borne troops reached Mosul on the3rd June.Intelligence.31. Syria. The report that German troops have landed in Syria has notbeen confirmed. It is reliably reported that aviation fuel and munitions are being sent there by Germany. Two reports state that instructions have been issued bythe French authorities to villagers in Syria to expect and help parachutists.32. German Air Force personnel are established at Aleppo, Damascus andPalmyra (in the central Syrian desert). There is little doubt that the germans are making their main base at Aleppo, with others at Hassiche (nearly 200 milesfurther to the east) and at Tel Kotchek (on the Syria-Iraq border, 70 miles N.W.of Mosul). Thus, a line of bases across N. Syria to Iraq and parallel to theTurkish frontier is designed to link up with those in the Eastern Mediterranean,thereby furthering the encirclement of Turkey.33. Iran. The Iranian Army is being increased from sixteen to eighteendivisions and the garrisons in the neighbourhood of the Anglo-Iranian oil company&apos;s Concession in S.E. Iran are being reinforced. There is no sign ofany reinforcement of the garrisons in Northern Iran near the Soviet border, whichmay indicate that there is at present less fear than usual of a Russian attack from Trans-Caucasia.34. Turkey. There are indications that the activities of the GermanIntelligence Service have recently &quot;been on the increase in Turkey. A newwhispering campaign that she is the next country on the list of those to be letdown by Great Britain has been started.35. Russia. It would seem that German preparations for an attack on russia (concentrations of. forces,.establishment of dumps, improvement of railway facilities and intensification of Fifth Column activities) must be practicallycomplete, but these&apos;preparations may still be used merely to ensure compliance with German demands in the negotiations which are believed to be taking place.If Russia declines to co-operate fully, military action by Germany appears likely.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Operations by Bomber Command have again been restricted bvunfavourable weather. Enemy night operations against this country have been on a heavier scale.Aircraft from Egypt have provided cover for the withdrawal of our forces from Crete.Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent Raid Assess-ment Reports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied Territory.General.37. ^ Bomber Command flew 131 sorties by day and 186 by night. This wasa reduction in the scale of effort by day compared with the previous week, but anincrease by night.Day.38. On the 2nd June, when Blenheims of Bomber Command were engaged on attacks on shipping in the Kiel area (see Coastal Operations), Naval Barracksare believed to have been hit by H.E. bombs, while a building near Rendsburg anda small factory near Brunsbuttel were set on fire. On the same day a Blenheimof Coastal Command scored direct hits on an aircraft factory at Havre, whichwas also set on fire. The port of Zeebrugge was attacked on the 4th June byBlenheim bombers and numerous bursts were observed on the Mole, where twoemplacements were machine-gunned.39. During the period under review offensive fighter operations were carriedout over North-East France and along the Belgian and French Coasts. military transport and columns of troops were attacked and two Hurricanes, one armed with cannon, sank a 300-ton trawler off Dunkirk.40. Strong fighter escorts were provided ori the 4th June for two attacks by Blenheim bombers on shipping at Boulogne; Supporting sweeps for these operations resulted in the destruction of three enemy fighters, with four damaged,against a loss of two Spitfires.41. The results of attacks on shipping carried out by the day bombersduring these operations are reported under Coastal Operations.Night.42. Owing to very unfavourable weather conditions during the week ournight bombers were unable to operate except on one occasion, when Dusseldorf wasthe main objective, with lighter attacks on Duisburg and Berlin.43. At Dusseldorf 127 tons of high explosive bombs, including a number ofthe heavier types, and 13,000 incendiaries, were dropped in the target areas.Industrial and ground haze hampered the observation of results, but many large fires were started, followed in some cases by heavy explosions. Fires were alsostarted in the Duisburg area. Better weather conditions were experienced over berlin, and many large fires and explosions were caused in the Western area ofthe City. During these operations one enemy night fighter was probably destroyed and four of our aircraft failed to return.United Kingdom.44. Fighter Command flew 977 patrols, involving 2,183 sorties by day and295 patrols, involving 433 sorties, by night. Compared with last week thesefigures show a reduction by day but an increase by night. By day there was afurther reduction in German Air Force operations, but at night the total effort was more than double that of the previous week, and, except on the29th/30th May, when weather conditions were particularly bad, an average of120 aircraft operated round and over our coasts.
45. Of the 250 long-range bombers and bomber reconnaissance aircraftplotted by day, the majority were engaged in coastal and shipping reconnaissance,and only 36 penetrated inland. Weather conditions were generally unfavourablefor interception, but two Ju. 88s were destroyed and several others damaged by our fighters.46. Enemy aircraft dropped bombs on Dublin on the night of the30th/31st May. On the night of the 1st/2nd June a concentrated attack Wasmade on Manchester by about 75 aircraft, and on two other nights over 100 bombersoperated overland against Merseyside, the Midlands, and dispersed targets onthe South side of the Thames Estuary. A considerable proportion of the enemyeffort was devoted to shipping reconnaissance and to minelaying,; in the latterabout 150 aircraft were engaged. During the week fifteen enemy aircraft were destroyed, eight by night fighters.Coastal Operations.47. Coastal Command flew 243 patrols and provided escortsfor 92 convoysinvolving a total of 682 sorties. Shipping protection patrols carried out by fighter Command totalled 546 and involved 1,114 sorties.48. Vigorous operations against enemy shipping by aircraft of Bomber and coastal Commands were continued. Bomber Command claimed direct hits on fivemerchant vessels totalling 10,200 tons. Of these one vessel of 1,200 tons ran intothe bank of the Kiel Canal at a point South-West of Rendsburg, and another of500 tons was sunk alongside the Mole at Zeebrugge. An attack by two aircraft on a ship of 5,000 tons located at Egersund was particularly successful, fourdirect hits being scored. Four Blenheims were lost in the course of these operations.49. In addition to numerous routine and special patrols, aircraft of coastal command carried out attacks on 21 enemy merchant vessels, some of which wereescorted by Flak ships or naval units. No ships are claimed as sunk, but manywere machine-gunned after bombs had narrowly missed their targets. Activitiesagainst U-boats are reported under &quot; Naval Situation.&quot;50. German bomber reconnaissance units from Norway and France operatedover the Western and North-Western Approaches and in the English and at . George&apos;s Channels. Enemy reconnaissances of shipping were also made offthe East Coast of England and Scotland.51. Shipping was attacked about 200 miles West of the Faroes in daylighton the 1^ June. On the nights of the lst/2nd and 2nd/3rd further attacks on shipping were made 15 miles North-East of Cape Wrath and off the East and north-East Coasts respectively. The long-range bomber force in Norway isbelieved to have been engaged on these operations.Malta.52. Blenheims have again made successful attacks on shipping betweenSicily and the Libyan Coast. On the 31st May three direct hits were made ona damaged merchant ship at anchor off Sfax, and on 3rd June five Blenheimswere despatched to attack a convoy of six merchant ships escorted by sixdestroj^ers, which had previously been located by air reconnaissance forty miles.S.E. of Pantellaria. Attacks were carried out with great determination, andas a result one ship of 8,000 tons blew up with a violent explosion, and another of about 5,000 tons was left ablaze after being hit by four bombs from an aircraft which crashed after being struck by the flying debris.53. Our reconnaissance aircraft have constantly patrolled the coasts of tunis and Tripoli and the Ionian Sea. During one of these flights a Marylanddestroyed an Italian seaplane on the water at Argostoli (Cephalonia). A fewminelaying sorties have also been flown.54.   No serious attacks were made on Malta during the week.   There was,however, considerable enemy reconnaissance activity.
Libya and Egypt.55. On six nights Wellingtons attacked Benghazi and many fires were seen to break out in the vicinity of the harbour. Violent explosions were also seennear a new landing ground south of Berka aerodrome.56. Hurricanes of the South African Air Force carried out reconnaissance flights and attacked thirteen enemy aircraft on Gambut landing ground, destroy-ing at least three of them. Standing patrols were maintained over snipping Inthe Tobruk area.57. Several daylight attacks were made on Tobruk by German bombersescorted by German and Italian fighters, on one occasion a total of fifty being employed. No serious damage has been reported, and our A.A. fire destroyed atleast fourteen enemy aircraft. On two nights about five enemy aircraft, one ofwhich was destroyed by A.A. fire, were engaged in minelaying off Alexandria,and a number of small bombs were dropped on the air port.Iraq and Syria.58. During the week aircraft operating from Palestine continued to recon-noitre Syrian aerodromes, roads and harbours, and were on one occasion attacked by two French fighters, which damaged one of them. Blenheims bombed the aerodromes at Horns and Aleppo, destroying one twin-engined aircraft by adirect hit and damaging several others. A petrol dump, at Beirut was attacked on two occasions, and two cisterns were set on fire. -An. tfafioaa bomber attacked a road construction party in Transjordan, near the Syrian frontier.59. In Iraq our bombing and machine-gun attacks continued until the cessation of hostilities. Screaming bombs were dropped on Rashid (Bagdad),where a large fire was started in an M.T. depot. Air reconnaissance was usedto ensure that the Iraqis were withdrawing in accordance with the terms of thearmistice. The Mosul area was reconnoitred and troops were subsequently flownthere by transport aircraft escorted by Blenheims.Abyssinia.60.. Our land operations in the West and South of Abyssinia have been supported by the Royal Air Force in the Sudan, the South African Air Forcein Kenya, and the Free French Air Force. Enemy troops, positions and transporthave been subjected to repeated bombing and machine-gun attacks, and manydirect hits were made by Wellesleys and Blenheims on buildings and troopcolumns. Our aircraft from Aden have reconnoitred the Assab and Jibuti areas.The only enemy aircraft encountered was attacked and damaged near Soddu byone of our fighters.General Air Intelligence.Iraq and Syria.61. The German Air Force detachment in Iraq has been withdrawn and isprobably in Syria. There have recently been certain changes in the organisationand dispositions of the French Air Force in Syria. The changes have been made,firstly, to conform with the requirements of the Armistice Commission, and,secondly, in adaptation to German intervention.Russia.62. It is reported that work on roads and aerodromes in Poland and roumania has been in progress for some time, and there are other indications that Germany is preparing to enforce her demands on the Soviet Union, ifnecessary by military force.J apan.- 63. There are reports that the number of aircraft in Formosa has recentlybeen increased. The object of this move is not at present clear, but it may be a defensive measure against American activity in the Philippines.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.64. Enemy bombing has again been on a small scale. Bombs were dropped by single aircraft at Peterhead, Portland, Fraserburgh, Wick, Cowes and in open country near Middlesbrough.By Night.65. Enemy bombing has not been on a heavy scale, although it shows aconsiderable increase on the previous week. Raids were made on Merseyside onthe nights of the 30th/31st May and the 31st May/1st June. A sharp raid wasmade on Manchester and Salford on the night of the lst/2nd June. A few bombs were dropped at Hull and Tweedmouth on the night of the 2nd/ 3rd June. Onthe night of the 4th/5th June an attack was made over a wide area in theMidlands, but most of the bombs fell ineffectively outside Birmingham; a fewbombs also fell in the Medway area. On other nights of the week only a fewminor incidents were reported.Damage.Merseyside, 31st May j 1st June.66. Hydraulic pressure and electric power were cut off at the East GladstoneDock and fires, which were soon under control, were started at West GladstoneDock. Serious damage was done to the North Section of the Hornby Dock, and thePort of Liverpool was closed for forty-eight hours.Manchester and Salford, 1st/2nd June.67. Damage in the centre of Manchester was mainby to business premises,but production at three important factories was affected. Some damage was alsodone to commercial premises in the Dock area.68. Transport was restricted by the closing of the main railway line toBolton and the north, and the blocking of many roads by debris and craters.Casualties.69. Casualties for the week ending 0600 hours, 4th June, are estimated at178 killed and 185 seriously injured. 70 people were killed and 86 seriously injured at Manchester and Salford during the night of the 1st/2nd June.Situation in Plymouth.70. Although a few bombs have dropped in Plymouth during May, these have not interfered with the work of repair necessitated by the heavy raids which took place in the latter part of April.71. Restoration of Utility Services has been facilitated by the reducednumber of buildings to be served; this particularly applies to electricity, whichis now supplied to the whole area.With the exception of two 8-inch mains, water supplies have now been restored in all areas.All gas consumers in Saltash are now receiving a full supply by means of aconnection from Exeter; the Plymouth Gas Company is producing 40-50 percent, of its pre-war output and should be able to supply all habitable property in its area by the end of June. Temporary arrangements have been made atDevonport gas works, and it is hoped that this area will be supplied in a few days.Millbay Railway Station is still closed to passenger traffic, but all lines arecleared. Goods traffic is restricted by damage to warehouses, sheds and commercial premises.All telephone junction and trunk circuits have been repaired, and allsubscribers in undemolished buildings in Saltash, Torpoint and Crown Hill arenow connected. Repairs have been completed to approximately half the lines toundemolished buildings served by the Plymouth and Devonport exchanges.
