TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.- It is requested that special care may be taken t* - -       jensure the secrecy of this document.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.     ^B&quot;WAR CABINET.ANTI-GAS PRECAUTIONS.Report by the Lord Privy Seal.Since the submission ef my report to the War Cabinet(W.P.(41)22)  on the state of sur anti-gas precautions, I have held further meetings with the departments and have receivedrepowfes-tsn the action taken to carry out the measures concert2. I now submit to the War Cabinet the following further report.      I deal first with measures for which the civil departments are responsible.I. publicity.With the approval of the War Cabinet (W.M.22(41) and 28(41)  6) a campaign of publicity has been launched inParliament,  in the press and on the wireless.      Tear gasexercises have been held in various places and a leaflet isLtti course of issue to every householder.,.     Further publicity&quot; will be kept going at a steady level in order that thesubject may not be allowed to fall again into the background.II. Gas Masks.4. The publicity campaign referred to above has includedspecial steps to encourage the carrying of gas masks,,      the response has on the whole been good.      It is, however,equally important that people should know how to put theirmasks on quickly.      I have suggested that instruction in doing this, with exercises, should be broadcast as hasalready been done in the case of physical training exercises.5. The Inspections of gas masks carried out by localauthorities   shows that apart from masks damaged in air rairibetween 5 and 10$ only were defective and in most cases neededonly minor repairs.      Standards of inspection have no doubtvaried.HI,    Concentrated Attack.6. An assessment has been made of the probable effect ofa gas raid on the maximum scale which is likely.     Assumptionsas to the distribution of bombs have been based en the bombcensus taken at Birmingham last November.      The assessmentcovers both phosgene and mustard gas and has been worked out for a large city, a dock area and a nodal paint.      The scale of our preparations has been reviewed in the light of thisSECRET.If.P. (41)94.29TH APRIL, 1941.

assessment and the conclusion reached is that where mustardgas is used alone,  the task of decontamination after a prolonged night raid Would &quot;be well within the power of theappropriate services,7, A much more serious problem would arise if key points and vital centres of communication were obstructed by a mass of contaminated debris produced by the use of H.E. bombsfollowed by showers of small mustard gas bombs.      Specialappliances (such as that known as a &quot;bulldozer&quot;) would be useful for clearing this away though not many such appliancesare available.      I refer below to the steps which have&quot; beentaken to strengthen the numbers of trained men available fordecontamination work.8,. The assessment of the probable effects of an attackwith phosgene shows that this need not be serious on the onecondition that the public are properly trained in putting ontheir gas masks  quickly,      It is for this reason that I have recommended the broadcasting of special instructions and exercises on this point.IV.    D e con t animation 0(a) Training of personnel.9. I referred in my previous report to the waste of manpower which must occur if trained anti-gas workers are con-scripted for the armed forces.      It has now been arranged thatthe calling up of members of decontamination squads who arenot reserved in their whole time occupation,, may be deferred atthe age of 55 or in special circumstancess  at 30.      training and exercises for decontamination squads are being intensified.Instructions have also been issued that members of rescueparties should be trained in decontamination duties.      Thishas already been done in many areas and is well advanced inof hers.10.        Special attention has been paid to decontamination atthe Western Ports,      In addition to the training of rescueparties in decontamination and arrangements for mutual supportbetween the local authorities of the four regions concerned; aconsiderable contribution has been made by the training ofSock workers for decontamination.(b) Cleansing^ of the General public and Decontaminationof Glotiiing.11,        The provision of cleansing facilities both for hospital cases and for the lightly injured and uninjured hasbeen reviewed since my previous report.      The provision of adequate facilities at casualty hospitals has improvedsubstantially and is being pressed forward.      Approximately50?b of the hospitals in question now have adequate arrange-ments and another 15vo have arrangements which could be usedbut which are not yet up to the proper standard.12.        For gas casualties who are lightly injured oruninjured it is now estimated that in the target areas about.2?000 centres are needed including those at First Aid Posts.These will  be placed where large numbers of people are most likely to be caught in the open with no facilities for washingclose at hand.     About two-thirds of the total number ofcentres required are now ready.      Work has been hampered bythe general shortage of labour and materials and by the pressure upon local authorities of other urgent tasks.Suggestions for the earmarking   and trarming of staff andrevised schedules of equipment nave been issued.15, Steps have been taken to expedite the delivery of mobilecleansing units and in view of production difficulties

4 &apos; nI  k (an improvised type has been designed &quot;by the Ministry ofWorksc    Anti-gas ointment is now on sale to the publiccArrangements have beer, made for bleach cream to be placedin buckets outside chemists shops if a blister gas attackoccurs.-.14,        G-* od progress has been made with the furtherdistribution to local authorities of clothing to be issuedtc those whose clothes have been destroyed.      As a result offurther negotiations with the laundry industry on thedecontamination of civilian clothing., the outstanding causes of difficulty have been removed and the situation is now very much more satisfactory.,V o    Foodstuffs, -i 5c      The; Ministry \f Food are issuing to the Food Tradesthrough, their associations a circular indicating the stepsto be taken, for the protection of foodstuffs fromcontamination.      The supply of tarpaulins needed is to be- ompleted. by the end of Mayo      Suggestions for theprotection, of domestic foodstuffs have been given tohouselioid.e:os in the leaflet recently issued by the Ministryof Home Security.      I have also asked that arrangements whichhave been made for the distribution of a special leafleton this subject to householders by local authorities in urban areas * and for the broadcasting of talks to householders,,should now be put into effect; and that talks of this hindshould be repeated from time to time as necessary.16-        Arrangements for the protection and disposal ofcontaminated foodstuffs are being made by local authorities.Sanitary i.rupee core have been detailed for the work and given special trainings      Food Treatment Stuads are being recruitedand trained and cppeals for volunteers have been made.Reports received from gas liaison officers attached tc thestaff of Divisicnoll  Food Officers show that approximately20% of the local auth rities concerned have submittedschemes for approval,  a further 50% are preparing schemes and steps are being taken to secure the preparation ofschemes by the remainder.,17,      A leaflet on the protection and decontamination of crops  is about to be issued by the Ministry of Agriculture,VI ,    Industry(a) Vital. &apos;FacitorTee:-]b.      All the o cupiers of vital factories have been urgedt-e complete their anti-gas arrangements where they have not already done so    and reports show that from 75-80% of thetotal have mute satisfactory arrangements 0      The majorityof those firms where preparations are less well advancedhave ohlj  recently been added to the list of vital factories and stops have been taken to bring their arrangements upto the required standard as quickly as possible *    Factorieshave been asked to see that their work people bring theirgas masks with them to work and to arrange for the gasmasks to be tested.

4i(b) Hon.&apos;-v11al Factories o19.      The information available on the state of precaution;in the very large number of non-vital factories is lesscompleteIn specimen districts of London, however.,satisfactory replies have been received in a largeproportion of cases to the question whether workers keep their gas masks handy, and have practiced wearing them.Factory occupiers have been asked to arrange periodicalpractices at the works-( &quot; ) Small  dispersed factories engaged on vital work.-,20-o In the course  of my inquiry it was suggested that insufficient provision had been made for decontaminationwork in small dispersed factories.      It was pointed outthat there are now many, hundreds of these small factoriesscattered over country districts which are neverthelessat work upon the production of the most vital weapons of war,      The policy of the dispersal of factories has only recently he or: fully developed and it is possiblethat further- scrutiny requires to be given to thearrangements made for passive air defence.    Dispersalis, however r.  in itself a considerable safeguard.    It is,for example.,, highly unlikely that a gas attack will be mad:upon such small and isolated factories.      The risk of fire? however,   is a more serious danger.    I have askedfor the passive air defence arrangements  in these factorieto be examinee as a matter of urgency, and I expect toreceive a report on this subject shortly.(d) Railways -210      The Ministry of Transport have now arranged with theRailway Executive Committee for instructions to be  issued to the companies to increase the scale on which cleansingfacilities are provided at all establishments.VIIo    Liaison between the Civil and Military Authorities,22.      The closest liaison now exists between the Civil and service Departments  in regard to cleansing anddecontamination and exchange of chemical and medical gasintelligence..-    Regional Commissioners have been asked tocall meetings of Service Commanders, Local Authoritiesand representatives of the Laundries in order to securethe most satisfactory use of the facilities available forthe decontamination of clothing.VIII.      State for- Preparedness in the Armed Forces.23o      I have received reports on the state of preparednessin the anti-gas measures of the Navy, Army and RoyalAir Force.      These show that the position is,  in general,satisfactory3      There is still; however, a considerableunsatisfied demand for service respirators.      Only 20%,for example,  of the Home Guard have so far receivedtheir respirators and in the case of the Royal Air Forceinitial Issues have not been made to recruits, respirators

being provided only at advanced training centres and operational units.      The figures which I have received,however, show that the production of service respiratorsis increasing rapidly and that the deficiencies are,therefore, being overtaken.2h.      A more important point concerns the method of soundinggas-alarms particularly where an attack with cloud gasis made from the sea.      The existing rattles clearly cannotbe relied upon for this purpose and the military authoritieshave asked for the issue of &quot;Strombos&quot; horns  (similar tofoghorns) for use in coastal districts.      Experts at theMinistry of Home Security are attempting to devise an improved system of gas alarms in both coastal and inlanddistricts and the possible use of a power gong is being investigated.(Int&apos;d).
