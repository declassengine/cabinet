Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1939.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (39) 165.TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SITUATION IN THE BALKANS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 12th September last I circulated to my colleagues a paper on theposition in the Balkans (W.P. (39) 25), which gave an account of the situation as it appeared after a week of war. In the intervening three months the positionin the Balkans has, to a considerable extent, been modified, chiefly as the resultof the emergence of Russia as a dominant Power and potential aggressor in that area, and I now circulate, for information, a short memorandum sketching theposition as it exists to-day.H.December 16, 1939.The countries covered by this paper are Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria,&quot;Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey.In the first three months of the war the position as between the balkan states themselves has not been radically modified. As was pointed out in thememorandum of the 12th September last, Hungary and Bulgaria are. the twodissatisfied Powers among these countries, and they remain to-day unsatisfied.Leaving Hungary aside, since she is on the rim rather than in the Balkans, themain problem has been to bring Bulgaria&apos;s policy into line with that of herneighbours, that is to say, the States composing the Balkan Entente, viz.,Roumania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey. Various efforts have been made tothis end, but without success, although there has lately been some improvement,due largely to British initiative, in Bulgaro-Turkish relations i.e., in therelations between Bulgaria and the only one of her neighbours against whom she has no territorial claims. On the other hand, it seems certain that in influentialcircles in Bulgaria the belief is now widespread that Germany is unlikely towin the war, and in consequence the desire of the Bulgarian Government to obtainby force of arms satisfaction of their territorial claims is fast disappearing.2. From the external point of view, the most important factor in the last three months has been the re-emergence of Russia as a Power with aggressiveimperialist ambitions in the Balkans. A second factor of some slight importance,10771   [20490] b
has been the campaign of Great Britain, aided by France, to check, by thepurchase of Balkan commodities, the unrestricted flow of supplies to Germany.As regards the first factor, Russia&apos;s recent invasion of Finland has aroused great anxiety, and fear of combined Russo-German action in the Balkans is widespread.At the same time, there can be no doubt that Russia has now taken the place ofGermany as the Power of whom the Balkan countries are most afraid. As regardsthe second factor, it is believed in Balkan countries that it is inevitable that thereshould be some reaction on the part of Germany to the economic policy which great Britain and France have now adopted.3. Meanwhile, the Balkan countries have managed to maintain their neutrality a neutrality which was, until quite recently, and is perhaps still,desired for different reasons not only by the Allies and by Italy, but by germany as well. Germany desired it, since she hoped that she could thereby obtainsupplies from the Balkan countries without extending her military commitments,and because such supplies represent a reinsurance policy against probable delays in Russian deliveries. Whether Germany is still in favour of maintainingneutrality in the Balkans is a question which depends upon the state of her relations with the Soviet, and the extent to which she still considers that the balkan States can, as neutrals, be of more value to her than they would be asbelligerents or conquered territory. Indeed, the whole elucidation of the Balkansituation now depends upon the two-fold problem represented by (a) Russia&apos;intentions, and (b) the degree of collusion between Russia and Germany.Balkan Co-operation against A ggression.4. Since the outbreak of war States belonging to the Balkan Entente havemade intermittent efforts to establish some form of co-operation which might enable them to resist aggression. Some reference has already been made to theimprovement in Bulgaro-Turkish relations. But Hungary&apos;s attitude towardsRoumania is hardly less hostile than it was two months ago, and the recentRoumanian proposals for the formation of a Balkan bloc with Italian co-operationhave been rejected, mainly perhaps on account of widespread distrust of Italiandesigns, which was shared by the French Government. Some discussions, however,between the Balkan nations continue. Recently, Turkey has shown a cautiouswillingness to consider a rapprochement with Italy. Balkan deliberations are,however, likely to lag behind the march of events, and it must be clearly realised that in the absence of the strongest military support by France and Great Britain,a Balkan bloc, even if it could be formed, would probably collapse at the first sign of invasion or even pressure.Present Position in Individual Countries.5. (a) Hungary. Hitherto the Hungarian Government have been opposedto any policy of adventure. While the sentiment of the people is not unfavourable to Britain the influence of the Hungarian Nazis has declined, and the ruling classis dominated by an intense dislike and suspicion of Russia. Diplomatically thecountry regards Italy as its sponsor. But Hungary lies in the orbit of german pressure. In the event of German aggression against Roumania, she wouldprobably resist a demand for the passage of German troops across her territory,but her resistance could hardly be of long duration. Moreover, she is determined to recover at least a part of her lost provinces, and she seems more and moreinclined to regard Roumania as a country on the verge of collapse. In the eventof such a collapse, it would be very difficult for any Hungarian Government torefuse a German invitation to&apos; occupy Transylvania. The Hungarian minister in London, has said that, if Roumania were to cede the Southern Dobrudja toBulgaria, the Hungarian Government would be compelled by public opinion to insist that Hungary&apos;s territorial claims in Transylvania should be also satisfied.(b) Roumania. Of all the Balkan nations Roumania is at present in theweakest position. She is threatened by Russia, subjected to strong pressure from Germany, and exposed to territorial claims from Hungary and Bulgaria.If she makes a concession to one country she fears she will have to face demands from the others.   Being particularly anxious about Bessarabia, certain quarters
in Roumania profess to believe that an immediate promise of Franco-british military support. i.c. an extension of our guarantee to cover the case of russian aggression, together with a firm warning to the Soviets, would act. as a sufficientdeterrent to Russian ambitions. This is optimistic, and. in any case, a promise of support from ourselves and the French must be dependent upon the attitude which Italy and Turkey would adopt towards a Russian threat to Roumania.In the absence of external military support Roumania is likely tomove into the German orbit. Most Roumanians, including King Carol, have afar greater fear and hate of Russia than of Germany and in the event of a Russianoccupation of Bessarabia might well accept German &quot;protection&quot; with somewillingness. It is one of the objects of German propaganda in Roumania to stimulate and support this point of view. Meanwhile. Roumania disposes of oil resources which are vital to Germany, and rather than offend the Reich she islikely, under the King&apos;s direction, to go a very considerable way towards meetingGerman requirements in the matter of oil.(c) Bulgaria. As in Hungary, (lie Government in Bulgaria professes, andprobably with some justification, to be opposed to policies of adventure. for reasons of self-preservation both the King and ruling classes are anti-russian and reject the idea of accepting any gifts, however welcome, from the Soviets.Whether, if the present Government were to fall, its successor would be able totake the same line is not, however, certain. Meanwhile, Russian influence is making itself strongly felt in the country and is increasing in extent and scope.Bulgaria, has just concluded an air convention with Russia, and is about to send a mission to Moscow to discuss commercial matters. Both these moves havearoused suspicion among her neighbours. While pro-German Biilgars arebeing bought with German gold, a genuine idealistic Communism existsamong the lower intelligentsia. On this account, the internal situationgives rise to some anxiety, for the soviet&apos;s power to create trouble is undeniable. For instance, the Soviet Government, once in Bessarabia,might expose Bulgaria to severe temptation by offering her the Dobrudja.Nevertheless, fear and mistrust of Russia, should the Soviets attempt to penetratefurther towards the Straits, would be widespread, and it is by no means certainthat the soil in Bulgaria would necessarily prove very fertile to Bolshevik propaganda. The economic position is not too unsatisfactory. As regardsGermany, it will be remembered that a quantity of German armaments havebeen delivered to Bulgaria.  This has also aroused suspicion among her neighbours.(d) Yugoslavia. Extreme caution, combined with some belief in her powerto remain neutral, is the chief characteristic of Yugoslav policy. Internalstability has benefited from the agreement concluded between the Serbs and theCroats just before the avar, although some trouble, as was to be expected, hasrecently manifested itself in Croatia. The army is short of modern armaments,particularly certain types of guns, and is, in the absence of supplies from Englandand France, mainly dependent on Germany for its rearmament. This is one ofthe reasons why the Yugoslav Government are so reluctant to take any actionlikely to offend Germany. While the Regent and the bulk of the population are undoubtedly, and even intensely, pro-Ally in sympathy, the ^esent Minister forForeign Affairs is certainly pro-German. Meanwhile. Russia makes some appealto the poorer intelligentsia and the students. The traditional mistrust of Italy,especially in the mind of the Prince Regent, has not disappeared, and in thecountry as a whole fear of Germany probably still outweighs that of Russia.Yugoslavia remains the most cautious of all the Balkan countries, and she willprobably try to remain neutral until she is invaded. On the other hand, apartfrom Turkey, she is the country in the Balkans most anxious to see an Alliedvictory, and from whom, perhaps, in the way of surprises, we have least to fearand most to expect.(e) Greece. At the beginning of the war the sentiment of the people wasoverwhelmingly pro-Ally. Recently the war has become more unpopular, mainlyas a result of the economic situation. Greece, unable to feed herself, is sufferingfrom a food shortage and from the restrictions imposed on her seaborne commerce.She has lately shown a tendency to blame the Allies for her economic ills, although these should more properly be ascribed to the inevitable disadvantages of war forall neutrals. On the other hand, a growing fear that Greece, among the otherBalkans States, may not be able to escape being involved, has prompted, for thefirst time, a suggestion on Greece&apos;s part that defence measures should be discussedconfidentially between the Greek General Staff and the French and BritishT20490] b 2
Military Attaches. Greece&apos;s relations with Italy have undergone some slightimprovement, but she continues to entertain misgivings regarding possible Italianintervention in the Balkans.(f) Turkey. As a key State in any defence scheme for the Balkans, Turkeyhas great influence on all her neighbours. Turkey always suspects any Powerwho is co-operating with Russia. This made her pro-German in the last warand makes her anti-German in this one. This does not mean that she is carrying-on an anti-Russian policy. On the contrary Turkey is anxious to maintain as good relations as possible with Russia, and is determined not to break with her unlessabsolutely forced to do so. She still hopes that she may serve as a bridge between russia and Great Britain and France. Meanwhile, however, the TurkishGovernment are becoming increasingly suspicious of the real nature of Russia&apos;simperialistic ambitions. To this fact must be ascribed in large measure hertreaty with ns, as also, more recently, her readiness to improve her relationswith Italy. Nevertheless, the Italian occupation of the Dodecanese will makeany permanent improvement in these relations difficult.From the recent discussions we have had with the Turkish Secretary-general it is clear that the Turks are not prepared to take any military action to saveBessarabia from Soviet occupation. They would, however, regard any russian advance across the Danube as a menace to their vital interests.Balkan Attitude towards the Great Powers.At the outbreak of war the Balkan peoples even perhaps the Bulgariansand Hungarians desired a victory of the Western Democracies, although their governments were afraid to give expression to these sentiments. Thisgeneralisation still remains true, but the war of inactivity in Western europe is perhaps doing something to shake their faith in the probability of a Franco-British victory. The power of Germany and Russia is visible and threatening;that of France and Britain has not yet asserted itself and is far away. Onthe other hand, recent events have undermined the belief of the Balkan nations that they can avoid being drawn into the conflict. If they thought that military support would be readily and effectively forthcoming from the Allies, they wouldprobably welcome such assistance. But as they are not convinced of either theone or the other, and as the fate of Poland and now Finland is in the forefront of their minds, they are tending to become more fatalistic in theiroutlook. More especially, Hungary and Bulgaria, while anxious to keep out ofthe war, must always feel that they might be able to profit by a German victory atthe expense of their more pro-Ally neighbours. Nevertheless, it is still true, as stated above, that the victory of the Western Democracies is generally desiredin the Balkans, and if at any time it were possible for the Allies to intervenewith overwhelming strength in South Eastern Europe their armies would inthose circumstances receive the most sympathetic of welcomes.Meanwhile, in the absence of striking victories and owing, too, to the inability of the Western Powers, although they are known to be rich and powerful,to supply armaments to these countries, Anglo-French prestige has superficiallyat least, and we may hope temporarily, declined. France, in particular, has long-lost her old hold on the Balkans, and the fate of Czecho-Slovakia and Polandhas not, of course, helped in its restoration.Probable Developments.As already stated, the elucidation of the Balkan situation must depend uponthe interpretation we puL firstly on Russia&apos;s intentions, and, secondly, on the degree of collusion existing between Germany and the Soviet Union. There isa tendency in many quarters to assume that the ambitions of these two Powers,in the Balkans and elsewhere, must necessarily collide. Thus it is argued thatif Germany wishes to master the whole Danube Basin down to the mouth, andif Russia for her part is intent on strengthening her hold on the Black sea and on reaching the Straits themselves, collision between the two Powers is inevitable. But it is surely just as possible that Russia and Germany willmoderate their ambitions, and that a basis will thus be provided for profitableco-operation. It seems not unlikely, for instance, that Germany might inviteRussia to occupy Bessarabia on the understanding that she Germany-wouldthen offer her &quot; protection &quot; to the rest of Roumania. thus ensuring, with Russia&apos;sconnivance, her oil and other supplies from that country.   Those who believe
in the solidity of the Russo-Germau link point out that it is unlikely that germany would have agreed to Russia being granted as free a hand in the Baltic as herrecent attack on Finland suggests she may have been, unless Germany, on herside, had secured complete liberty of action in the direction of the Straits.Whatever may be the exact truth, it would clearly be in the highest degree unwise to frame any policy in the Balkans which excludes the possibility of close Russo-German co-operation in that ai*ea.There remains the position of Italy. She has definite interests in the balkans and has shown herself to be distinctly hostile to Russian pretensions in that area.The latest evidence of this attitude is supplied by the text of the Fascist GrandCouncil Resolution of the 7th December. It is possible that Italian influence, if she cared to exercise it. might be powerful enough to deter both Russia andGermany from forcing the situation. At the same time, it is equally possiblethat, in the event of joint action by Russia and Germany in the Balkans, italy might be tempted to throw in her lot with the aggressors, e.g., by an attack inthe direction of Salonika from her bases in Albania, in order to obtain what spoilsshe could.   Of these spoils, she probably covets most the Dalmatian coast.Nor is a German attempt to revive the Axis policy out of the question. this might take the form of a German offer of collaboration with Italy with the objectof stemming Russian influence in the Balkans. When these aims had- beenaccomplished, Signor Mussolini would doubtless be used as the medium for newpeace proposals. We have had some evidence that such a policy has beenconsidered in Germany.Conclusion.If, as is clear, the Balkans are completely unable to resist aggression withoutoutside aid, and if, further, such aggression is probable, or, at least very possible,the Allies are faced with a difficult situation. (The mere absorption ofBessarabia, if indeed Russia&apos;s action was confined to this area alone, would possibly leave the situation much as it is to-day.) The French and british military representatives have lately been engaged in active discussion of themilitary measures open to them to protect their interests in this area, but on political grounds it is obvious that those measures must be framed within thelimits set (1) by the attitude of Italy; (2) by the material means of which theAllies dispose; and (3) by the possibility of attaining the objectives which thetwo Governments together regard as essential. In other words, it is of first importance in the Balkans to cut our coat according to our cloth.
