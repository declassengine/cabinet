In the course of our ex. amination of this problem we reachedthe conclusion that a further method of stopping the export ofthis iron ore to Germany might be by sabotage of the railways bywhich it is carried or the mines themselves,      We thought it advisable to put forward our views on this aspect of the problem in the same report,3.      Since the discussion in the War Cabinet on the 30thNovember, two further papers which have a direct bearing upon this subject have been circulated.if*     Firstly, the First Lord of the Admiralty has circulated aMemorandum which envisages the stoppage of all sources of supplyof Swedish iron ore to Germany.     This paper raises far largerissues than those which we were originally invited to considerby the War Cabinet.5.      Secondly, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs hascirculated a Memorandum on the situation in Scandinavia* W.M.(39^ th Conclusions, MinuieTTJ* W.P.( 39)162x W.P.(39)16L

and the possible results of the Russian invasion of Finland..     In this paper the suggestion is made that we may well he faced in the near future withimportant decisions relating to the assistance which we may find ourselves obliged to provideto Norway and/or Sweden in the light of possible future developments in Scandinavia resulting fromthe Russian invasion.6. From the above,  it is clear that theoriginal suggestion that we might take certain measures to stop the export of Swedish iron ore from Narvik has become involved with the major questions of Germany&apos;s entire supplies of iron ore and our general policy in Scandinavia with regardto both Russia and Germany.7. In the time available we have been quiteunable to give our fully considered views on thewhole of the problem in its widest aspects.      Onthe other hand, we understand that the military co-operation-ordination Committee is considering the papermentioned in para. 5 above,  and we thought thatit might be of assistance to them if we put forward a few general observations on the question of theaction which Germany and the U.S.S.R. might take in scandinavia and in turn the action which we mighthave to take in anticipation or as a result ofsuch action.8. We therefore,  set out. our report in thefollowing form:-Part 1.    An appreciation of the Military factors involved in attempting to stop theexport of iron ore from Narvik to Germany,either by naval action or by sabotage..-2-

The problem of interrupting&apos; by naval action the Swedishexports of iron ore to Germany has been the subject of close examination by the Naval Staff,.During the last war we attempted to interrupt the Narvikroute, outside territorial waters, by cruiser and destroyersweeps up the Norwegian Coast,  oy submarine patrols and also bypatrols at the entrance to Vest Fjord, at the head of whichNarvik lies.      The fact that shipping could remain insideNorwegian territorial waters throughout the passage from Narvikto the Naze, however, rendered all our offorts abortive.      Forthe greater part.of the voyage the ships kept in the inner Fjordsand were not visible from the high seas at all.10.        It is evident that a repetition of the efforts of thelast war would be of no avail and the Naval Staff have reachedthe conclusion that the stoppage of the shipment of iron ore from Narvik to Germany by naval action must involve theviolation of Norwegian neutrality.Ao      Stationing a Naval Force in Norwegianterr1torial waters.11.        Iron-ore ships bound for Germany could be most effectivelyintercepted close to Narvik, and naval patrols could beestablished in the territorial waters of Vest Fjord.      Theywould intercept all outward-bound ships from Narvik, and divertto the United Kingdom all ships carrying cargoes destined for germany..

The force to he sent would not he large and would hebased on anchorages in the vicinity0   We must, however, beprepared to resist by force any attempt by Norway to protectshipping in her own territorial waters.    The Norwegian Navycontains coast defence vessels armed with 8-inch guns, so thata British naval force of destroyers would need to he supportedby a cruiser force *    In addition covering protection would berequired to prevent interference by the German Fleet.12.       Alternatively it should be possible to interceptshipping inside territorial waters at points much further South,e.g. , at those places where the territorial waters are open toseaward.    Stadlandet, for instance, is well to the southward, andit should be easier for us to maintain patrols there, althoughit would also be easier for German naval and air forces to raidthe patrolso    Increased opportunitj&apos;&quot; for evasion would he givento the ore shipsywho might be able to make use of the hours ofdarkness to pass to seaward of the patrols0B.      Laying; a minefield in norwegian territorial waters.15o        The laying of minefields in Norwegian territorial watersso as to force shipping out into the open sea is anotherpossibility which has been carefully consideredoThere are only a few places in Nor?/norwegian waters,south of Narvik,s where a minefield could be laid and maintained in spite of attempts to sweep a channel *Much the best site&quot;is&quot;off -Stadlandet (620 10&apos; H), wherethe depth of water would permit the minefield being extendedfar enough to seaward to-compel a really good offing.

It has, however,  the disadvantage, of being the nearest toGermany of the possible positions.      Moreover it ...ustbe borne in mind that for a period such minefields might very well lead to considerable losses of merchant skipping,even if their existence had been duly notified.14. On the other hand minefields might cause lesschance jf       wruc&quot; clash with the Norwegian l.&apos;av &apos;,  since our putrols voulcl only be actively intercept in;; slii ; ingon the high seas.15. It should be mentioned that the anti-submarine minefield which the Norwegians were induced,&quot;by severe pressure from us,  to last&quot; in their watersas an extension of our Northern Barrage in September1910, when Germany&apos;s defeat was imminent,  left open achannel for merchant shipping inside territorial waters,and thus had no effect in stopping the iron ore trade.General Comment on the Naval action proposed.15. As regards the proposal to stop the ore by u- i^ucopatrols in territorial waters,  the most effectivemethod would be to station a Naval force in the VestFjord ana so iav. cr cept it close to the port of origin.17. Generally spe&amp;hing, however,  the Adi.it? alt;-view favours the laying of minefields, in preference to establishing patrols in territorial waters,  since the ris?.cof armed clashes with the Norwegians might be lessened.

IS.      Any of these plans however would involve theviolation of Norwegian neutrality and would he resented&quot;by Norway.      As far as the legal aspect is concerned only a   prior violation by Germany of this neutralitycould be used to justify such action.      Such anopportunity has now been presented by the recent actiono -4&amp;e--germarls-.in-^trpedoing and sinking 2 Britishand 1 Neutral ships in Norwegian pterritorial waters.It is conceivable that this action has been taken withthe deliberate intention of provoking counter-action by us, which would then give Germany the opportunityfor tching the military measures outlined in paragraph29 et ser.      On the other hand, Germany may be hoping that the sinking of these ships will cause the Norwegiansto eScort shipping in convoy through her territorial waters,  and thus grant additional szecurity to the ships carrying ore to Germany.      The latter possibility isborne out by the fact that an ir.imedii.te reaction from Norway has been to suggest such convoys.(2)      STOPPAGE BY SABOTAGE.19.      The Galivare mines and the railways carrying the ore to the ports of Narvik and Lulea and via - orjus toJor.i are all electrified.      Destruction of the generating station at Aorjus,  the normal source of power, wouldbe of lit.:le use by itself,  since all Sweden is connectedby a high-tension grid and other stations could be quicklyswitched on to feed the mines and railwa3&quot;s.      Further,  itwould always be possible to continue transport 03? ore withsteam locomotion,  although on a reduced scale.      We under-stand that sabotage at the mines themselves would be equally-6-

unprofitable since they are on the surface and littlein the way of permanent damage could be effected.Sabotage of the ore quays at Narvik is not consideredfeasible as they are practically in the town and welloverlooked.The only useful objective for sabotage, thereforeis the Narvik-Galivare-Lulea and the Galivare-Porjus-Jdrnrailways.Sabotage of the railway in Norway.20.      The railway from the mines to Narvik runs throughprecipitous country.      It has numerous tunnels and thereare many places where enormous masses of rock overhangthe line.      The Norwegians are reported to have minedthe line already in six places and it is estimated thatthe resulting damage, if these were blown, would render it useless for a year.      Even if this is an exaggeration,there is no doubt that sabotage of the line might stop the transport of ore from the mines for some months.Sabotage of the railway in Sweden.21.      Prom the limited information at our disposal itappears that the railways between the mines and Lulea,and via Porjus to Jorn run through much easier country.There are no tunnels on these lines and the few bridgesare little more than culverts.      It appears doubtful,therefore, whether any points exist, the sabotage ofwhich would have a lasting effect, but there is apossibility that the embankments on the Galivare -Porjus sector may be more susceptible to this form of destruction.      The War Office are making a further investigation of the question.      The advantage of sabotage on these.sections of the line is, of course,that it would not entail the loss of iron ore to us.

General comment on the possibility of Sabotage.22.       Any attempt       our part to sabotage the railwaysmentioned above would be an act deliberately hostile to Norwegian or Swedish sovereignty which, could not beundertaken without the agreement of the countries concerned whowould .require full financial compensation-before such agreement could be obtained.23o        Sabotage of the railway between Galivare and Narvikwould deprive us, as well as the Germans, of iron ore.      Itis, therefore, important  to determine whether this supply is vital to our- own requirements.      Sabotage of the Galivare -Lulea or the Galivare-Porjus sectors, however, would have no effect on the supply to this country, and if it were to provepracticable, would produce a very important effect on Germansupply.      Indeed;  if carried out in conjunction with the narvik traffic,  it might have a far-reaching effect on the duration ox the war.If, however,  action were taken to stop the Narvik(traffic now, any subsequent chance of stopping the Lulea traffic in the Spring by sabotage would almost certainly be compromised.24-0        If it is decided to undertake sabotage,  it should however be realised that substantial results could only beobtained by the employment of a large flaunt of material andhighly qualified personnel. In fact,unless the destruction were-carried out by the Norwegians or Swedes themselves,it would first be necessary to land a force to cover thenecessary operations.     Agents acting by themselves would be unlikely to effect major damage of a lasting nature.

(3)    THE POSITION OF THE SCANDINAVI.3T STATESVNorway&apos;s Position-25.       Germany&apos;s immediate reaction to a Britishviolation of Norwegian waters or territory would almost certainly be a peremptory demand that Norway shouldassert her rights as a neutral;    either by compellingthe withdrawal of our naval patrols, or by sweeping a passage through our minefields, or by threatening tobreak off relations with Great Britain.     The norwegian government would then be faced with the difficultchoice of:-(a) attempting to resist the force majeure ofsuperior British naval forces;(b) informing the German Government thatshe was unable to protect her ownneutrality;or(c) participating openly in the war on one side or the other.The chances of the war spreading to Seandinavia would thus be very greatly increased.Sweden&apos;s Position.26.       Sweden must inevitably be closely affected bjfany action we may take, to prevent the export of heriron ore to. Germany, even if such action is confined toNorwegian territorial waters or Norwegian soil.27.       If action is limited to the infringement of norwegian territorial waters, increasing german pressure upon Sweden to develop her raLlways and

Baltic ports rausi- be expected so that Germany could make good the loss of the Narvik orea     Although such development would take time we are advised that all german requirements could ultimately he met from theBaltic Ports,.Generals28o There are indications that Sweden considers that soviet Russia&apos;s real goal lies west of Finland&apos;s Westernfrontier and is; in fact. North Sweden with its untoldwealth in iron and Narviko      Moreover Sweden realisesthat Germany will hardly sxb still and watch the Russiansappropriating the Scandinavian sources of wealth withoutproviding a balance to her- own advantage *      Sweden,,therefores and to a very similar extent Norway are in theunenviable position of fearing both Russian and Germanencroachments      Up to the present Bis Majesty      GovernmentTcommitments to the Scandinavian countries have been limitedto a confidential assurance that they will consider anattack on Norway as tantamount to an attack on the UnitedKingdom-,        It ist therefore, possible that Norway andpossibly Sweden may be forced to the reluctant conclusionthat their only means of escaping from Russian dominationis to look to Germany for protecto onD290 We now turn to the consideration of possible Germanand/or Russian action In Scandinavia and of the countermeasures which we minht taker.a Oslo Telegram No*5S Savingt 18th DecemberP-10-

PART II - POSSIBLE GERMAN AND/OR RUSSIAN ACTION in scandinavia AND THE COUNTER-MEASURES WHICHWE MIGHT TAitE.29.      Developments in the Scandinavian situation might come about as a result of :-(i)^Action by Russia to seize .Narvik..and/.-r the Galivare iron ore fields inNorthern Sweden or -(ii) Action by us either to stop the export of iron ore from Narvik and/or an attempt to forestallthe above action by Russia, by ourselvesgaining control of the Swedish ore fields.30.      If Russia takes action in accordance with (i) abovethe only effective counter-measure which we can take toprevent her achieving her object is to land a force at narvik with the object of seizing control of Swedish iron ore before Russia can do so. Such action is likely to be acceptable to the Swedes and would have the advantage of placing a British force in a position to carry out the- destruction referred to in paragraph 22 above.31.      We now consider what the re-actions of Russia andGermany might be if we were to send a force to Narvik.German Re-action.32.      In order to evict us from Northern Sweden it would benecessary, during the Winter months,  for Germany to invadeSouthern Sweden and to establish a Winter base for subsequent advance to the North.    The whole of southern sweden is within easy range ^f air striking forces based in Germany.    This factor alone might strongly force the swedes against resistance.    Moreover, the Swedish Armyconsists of only six divisions whose progaramme of re-equip-ment is still someway short of completion.    It is estimatedthat Germany would not require to use more than fifteendivisions to over-run the Southern part of the country.fjlf the Swedes were to resist the German invasion, Germanyif   .[ [would be denied supplies of iron ore from SouthernI ISweden during th^ time it would take for her to subdueI  ^bhe Southern part of the country.

33-v      ^ could offer no direct effective naval or airopposition to a German seaborne expedition agp ins t southern sweden other than by attempting to operate subsidy;: rines inthe Baltic against German sea communications.     A british military expedition to support the Swedes could only bebased on the Trcndheim-Ostersund-Stockhoim railway.     Ourformat ions, as at present equipped, are unsuitable for operating in the difficult terrain of Southern Scandinavia at any ti\iof the year, although &quot; here js the possibility that a 31ro.IL fbrce onskis slight be organised with Dominion (e.g. Canadian)assistance.      Such an expedition, however, would be subjected to a considerable scale of air attack on its one line ofcommunication from Trondheim.Invasion of Southern Norway.34.       Alternatively Germany might decide to invade southern norway, in which case her first object would probably be toestablish air or naval bases at Oslo, Kristiansand, Stavangerand Saugesund.      In view of the weakness of the Norwegian airforce and anti-aircraft defences, the initial forces might be flown,   in.      Since we could not effectively interrupt thesea communications through the Kattegat to Oslo, furtherforces could speedily follow.      There is little prospect thatthe Norwegians, whose whole army amounts to little more thanone scattered division could offer much   resistance.     Liore-over, it is at least doubtful whether Norway would attempt to resist, especially if \;e had precipitated the German action by violating her neutrality.     In any event the largest force the Germans would be likely to require South of Trondheimwould be from two to three divisions.

35 As soon as Germany had&apos; succeeded in establishingherself in Southern Norway,  she would be in a good positionto:-(a) intensify her attack on our naval forcescontrolling the Northern exit from the north sea and against our naval bases       Scapaand the Shetlands are only 2*3,0 miles fromStavshger, as compared with nearly &apos;j00 milesfrom Germany-(b) keep part of our Northern patrol under airobservation and thus facilitate surface attackon these forces,(c) intensify her submarine warfare by refuellingand retreshing U-boats returning from patrol,thus saving the additional voyage to and fromGermany.id)    dispute the control of any minefield we had laid in Norwegian waters-      She might be ableto. maintain a swept channel through theminefield, for merchant shipping-(e)    Intensify her attack on our convoys from Norway..36.        If Germany decided to maintain her forces by seathrough the Kattegat to Oslo, we should have little chanceof interrupting these communications effectively.      Inaddition, Germany would be able tc make some use by night o:.the sea. route to Stavanger and Bergen.37*        lai the face of German forces established in southern norway, we should be unable to give the Norwegians anyeffect!v-0 military assistance in that part of their country,although we might be able to bomb the German communications.British trade with Southern Norway, for which Bergen is amain centre, would cease entirely.38,.       The above disadvantages of Geiigaavv becoming established in Southern Norway wouldbe to seme extent reduced if we couldseize the island of Bommeln The occupation of this island would enable us to secure the eastern flank of theNorthern mine barrage    and to control traffic using Norwegianterri oor j. 3.1 waters.,

39. There is a further important consideration which should he taken into account if Germany invadeseither Norway or Sweden.     In order to dispute our control of the Northern Swedish ore fields germany would have to despatch a considerable force and thiswould entail an appreciable dispersion of hereffective strength.     The force which we should hecompelled to send to achieve this would he in comparison small and could he withdrawn if necessary.Russian Re-actions,40. If in order to save the iron ore fields from falling into the hands of Russia we decided to despatch a force to Narvik, we must face thepossibility of hostilities with that country, althoughit is by no means inevitable that either side needdeclare war upon the other.     In that event russia might take the following action against our interests :-NAVY,(i)(ii)( iii)( iv)Russian submarines in considerable numberscould operate against us in the Balticand on the Atlantic trade routes.Unless Turkey prevented the passage ofRussian warships through the Dardanelles,Russian submarines could attack ourMediterranean trade.In the Far East Russian interference withour trade would not necessarily be serious since most of our more importanttrade is in the South China Sea.Russia could provide bases for theoperation of German armed merchant cruisers and raiders.

inARMY M)AIR,(v)     Russia constitutes a menace to Iraq., iran and India, but recent experience in finland has net enhanced the reputation of Russian land forces a     Moreover thestiffen the resistance which can be offered tc her invasion of Scandinaviathe less would she be inclined tcembark on expeditions in the Near and middle East.41o In coming to a decision as to our action inthe face of Russian aggression in NorthernScandinavia the time factor is all important,,      if on the first sign of Russian action we do not immediately seize the initiative we may lose foreverthe opportunity of preventing the valuable orefields falling into Russian hands and the opportunityof getting a force into Sweden with which eventually to destroy the mines and railways.      Once the fieldsare in Russian hands it will be open to her to release as much of the ore to Germany as she may wish..42* On the other hand, by coming into conflict with Russia we should run the risk of throwing hermore firmly into the arms of Germany,

Immediate action to stop   supplies from Narvik &quot;by Sea.43-        As already shown in Part I, the Admiralty viewfavours the laying of mine-fields in preference to establishing patrols in Norwegian territorial waters asa means of stopping the export of iron ore from Narvik,since the risk of armed clashes with the Norwegians mightthereby be lessened.44.        If we take the initiative now we shall put immediateeconomic pressure on Germany which, as stated by thesiMinistry of Economic Warfare, &quot;would be likely to cause bynext Spring such a substantial curtailment of German steel production as to have an extremely serious repercussion on german industrial output.&quot;45.       It is, however, only right to record that in thesame Report the Ministry of Economic Warfare make thefollowing observation;-&quot;Whe; eas the closure of Narvik alone might notcause more than acute embarrassment to Germany,the closure of Narvik followed by a stoppage of exports via Lulea might well bring german industry to a standstill and would in any case have a profound effect on the duration of thewar.&quot;46.       In view of the slight apparent disparity in theabove views expressed by the Ministry of Economic Warfare,we feel that there should be no doubt in the minds of theWar Cabinet as to the precise effect on Germany1s ability to prosecute the war,  (a) by the stoppage of iron ore from narvik and (b) by the cutting off of all Swedish iron oresupplies from Germany.      This indeed is the crux of thewhole problem and upon this question will depend thedecision as to the action to be taken.36 Paper No. W.P. (G) (39)153.

Possible German re-actions to the stoppage of Ore Supplies from Narvik,47.       We consider it unlikely that as a result of theestablishment of a mine-field in Norwegian territorial waters Germany would invade southern Sweden unless shewas certain that the Swedes would not resist.48.        It is unlikely that Norway will acquiesce in theestablishment of a mine-field in her territorial waters without a protest and it may be that our relations withthat country may suffer.     For the immediate future this may be inconsequential but if subsequently we found itnecessary to despatch a force to Narvik, as postulated in paras. 30 - 42       above, we might find it a graveinconvenience if Norwegian opinion had already hardenedagainst us.      Conversely,  the acquiescence of Norway inthe landing of forces in her territories, if this should prove necessary, would be much facilitated if we had hergoodwill.Russian Re-actions.49.        It cannot be overlooked that if we stop iron oresupplies from Narvik by the measures proposed above this may precipitate a Russian advance into Scandinavia with aview to seizing the orefields.     In effect, therefore,the institution of the mine-field might force us to face the necessity for taking the anticipatory action inNorthern Norway referred to in para. 41  above.

Summary and conclusions.50.      To sum up: -Part I.Naval action against Narvik Ore.(a).    As regards naval patrols in territorial waters, the most effective method of stopping the Narvik traffic to Germany would he toplace a naval force in the Vest Fjord.(b) The alternative of placing patrols in territorial waters further South is likely to be less effective,  although the distance from Britishbases is very much less.(c) To place minefields in neutral territorial waters has the advantage that the actualinterception of shipping would take placeon the high seas and the chances of armedclashes v/ith the Norwegians would be lessened.Sabotage.(d)    Sabotage of the Galivare - Narvik section ofthe railway would re-act to our disadvantage in that it would also stop the supply of iron ore to this country and should be regardedas a last resort.(e)    If sabotage of the Galivare - Lulea or Galivare -Porjus sections of the railway provespracticable it might be more effective in the spring, but its execution might be prejudicedif prior action had been taken in the Narviksection.      Damage to this railway howeveris unlikely to have any prolonged effect unlessdeliberately carried out under a coveringmilitary force.Part II.Possible German and/or Russian Action and our&apos; Counter-Measures.( f)    The situation in Scandinavia may develop either as a result of Russian action,  or might be initiated by ourselves, by laying a minefieldin Norwegian waters.(g) The only action we can take to prevent the Russianscapturing Narvik and the Northern iron orefields is to despatch a force to Narvik.(h) If we sent a force to Narvik, Germany is likelyto invade either-- Southern Sweden or southern norway or both.      We could not prevent suchaction.      By an invasion of Norway, Germany would gain important strategical advantages, but these would not be sufficiently serious to deter us from action to stop the Narvik iron ore traffic.Our position would be considerably improved ifwe could occupy the Island of BiJmmelo.-18-

( i)   If we sent a force to Narvik v/e should haveto he prepared to face hostilities withRussia.     In these circumstances consider-able additional commitments might have tobe accepted.( i)    In coming to a decision as to our action inthe face of Russian aggression the time factor is all important.      If we do notseize the opportunity on the first sign ofRussian action we may lose forever theopportunity of denying the ore fields toGermany.( k)    if&apos; v/e were to initiate action bylaying a mine field in Norwegian territorial waters , we think it unlikelythat Germany would invade SouthernScandinavia.( i)    On the other hand the laying of a mine fieldmight alienate Norwegian opinion and thusmake it more difficult for us if it werelater decided to despatch a force throughNarvik to the Northern iron ore fields.( m)    Any decision to lay a mine field in norwegian territorial waters thereforemust be closely related to future policyin respect of the Northern iron ore fields.( n)    Finally, we wish to emphasise that before adecision is reached to take any action to deprive Germany of the Swedish iron ore,  itis of the highest importance that a reallyfirm estimate is given of the preciseeffect which the stoppage of these supplies will have on the German war effort.(Signed;DUDLEYEDMUNDNEWALLPOUNDIRONSIDERichmond Terrace, S.W.1.20th December, 1959.
