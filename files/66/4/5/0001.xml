Our views are as follows:-Naval Operations.-2. There is no possibility of affording any relief t*the Royal Navy by a truce.    Any enemy forces wishing to enteror leave the North Sea could, do so with impunity during a truce.    Anti-submarine measures cannot possibly be relaxed,convoys must continue to sail and the ceaseless battleagainst mines cannot be interrupted.    Moreover the minesthemselves could not be expected to observe a truce.    from the naval point of view,  therefore,  the proposal isimpr ac t ic abl e.Land Operations.3. Fraternization between the opposing armies would inevitably occur in a truce 0        The British Army is as yetonly slightly engaged; but fraternisation with the enemy by our troops and more particularly by the French cannot beallowed.    We note that M. Daladier has reacted very strongly against the proposal (vide Paris Telegram No.419of 9th December, 1939; and considers that a truce &quot;would undermine the morale of the troops,Air Operations.4. The work of the Coastal Command must continue without interruption,  in the same way as the operations of the Royal Navy.    Any slackening in our patrol activityeither at sea or in France would be an invitation to theenemy to take advantage of the fact to alter his dispositions.Moreover we could, not forego any favourable opportunity foran attack on a fleeting target e,g. the Deutschland.2EW.M.

CONCLUSIONS58 We are of the opinion that a truce, even if it were practicable, would be most undesirable,  and we recommendthat the proposal should, be rejected,,(Signed)    RoE.C.
