GERMAN AND RUSSIAN DESIGNS ON norway and SWEDEN.The Soviet are reported to have three Divisionsconcentrated at Murmansk preparing for a seaborneexpedition.From Tszarist times Russia has wanted a goodAtlantic base.a successful landing on the north-west Scandinaviancoast would: -(a) Place them on the flank or rear of the Finns.(b) Give them contro-. of the Swedish ore.(c) Avoid traversing difficult country withoutc ommun i c at i on s.(d) Give them a strong hand against Germany.(e) Regain prestige lost by the setbacks in thepresent Russo-Finnish war.The following pointers to German intentions havebeen r received.The Swedish Naval Attache in Berlin has stated itas his conviction that if Sweden is involved in hostilities with Russia, Germany will invade the south of Sweden,nominally in support of her ally, but in reality to preventSwedish ore industry from falling into Russian hands.Secret reports have said that the German Legationat Stockholm have received a despatch which says in effectthat G, rinany could not tolerate the northern countriesconstantly serving as tools for the Western Powers, andin this connection she considered that Sweden had assumed the role of leader.A rumour has been received from Stettin that something was planned against Sweden, with or withoutRussian co-operation, particularly if in future the import&apos;of iron ore from Sweden to Germany did not function properly.Another secret report has stated that the FrenchSenatorial Commission for Air was in possession ofinformation, early in December, which was taken as indicating that the Germans were considering carrying out an invasion of Sweden before long.As regards preparations, recent reports have tended to show that the concentration of German troops andtroopships is in the Baltic in the neighbourhood of Swinemunde/Stettin rather than Hamburg.  -The reactions of the northern countries generallyappears to be that if Finland succeeds in maintaining herresistance to Russia,  they will maintain a firm attitude, butthat /

that if the Russians obtain a quick -victory, they wigive way to Russian demands.In Sweden resentment against Germany is steadily increasing.NAVAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION.23rd December, 1939.
