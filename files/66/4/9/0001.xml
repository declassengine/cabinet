V/avellMajor-General IsmayMajor-General Howard VyseBrigadier KennedyColonel MacleodL t.-Colone1 Re dma mr. Berkeley.1. GENERAL GAMELIN explained that the purpose of theMeeting was merely to e;rplore the political and militaryconditions in the Balkans and the i*epercussions of any decision to act there, which might be taksn later by thetwo Governments.      The Allies might be compelled to act inthe Balkans;    but they might also at some stage considerit politically desirable to take the initiative there.In either case preparations were required.2. The French Government attached the utmost importanceto the Balkan problem.      It was for them not merely a questionof prestige and of honouring the engagements which they had undertaken, but of the grave political and militaryconsequences which would ensue if the Germans or the RjssJans,or even possibly Italy,  should, reach&quot;the Straits and theMediterranean.      If the Allies were taken by surprise in

the Balkans, the other side might achieve very considerableresults which we would be -powerless to prevent.Preparations to build up a Balkan front, which would cover the Aegean Sea and the Straits, were therefore essential.A front of this kind would tend &quot;to occupy aonsjdersble enemy forces;and in this connection the important part played bySalonica in the last -war must not be forgotten.      At thesame time, the Y/estern Front remained the decisive theatre.3. As regards the possible constitution of a front,the following were the available strengths of the balkan countries concerned:Roumania.......... 31 Divisions.Yugoslavia.......26 Divisions.Greece............17 Divisions.Turkey............57 Divisions.Ill Divisions.4. The military objectives might be merely to defend theStraits and Salonika, or to go further aad defend the integrity of Yugoslavia cr of Roumania. In the two latter cases theposition of Bulgaria was, of course, of primary importance.5.        Prom the political point of view, it was evidentthat we could go to Thrace only with the agreement of Turkey;to    Salonika   only   with the agreement of Greece and ofItaly.      Further, we oould not transport and maintain substantialforces in the Near East unless   Italjr were effectivelyneutral.      And so as far as France v/as concerned, theattitude of Italy governed the    number   of the effectivesthat could he made available from Northern -Africa and theAlps.6. In the political sphere there were three new. factors.First there had recently been a series of conversations withthe. Yugoslavs, in which the latter had conveyed their determination to act whole-heartedly in favour of the Prench

6?and the British.     a French Staff Officer had gone to yugoslavia, and the Yugoslavs had asked for permission tosend a Mission to France.7. Secondly, in Greece authority had been given toGeneral Papagos by General Metaxas to get in touch withthe French regarding possible collaboration in Salonica and elsewhere.8. Thirdly - and this was highly secret - on the 8thDecember M. Tatax^escu had declared to the French ambassador in Roumania that the Roumanian Government had now made up its mind to resist to the utmost any attack, whether german or Russian.Their information was that Russia was preparing toattack Roumania on the same lines as she had just attackedFinland.      Further, a Roumanian Officer, sent to Germanyto investigate, had reported that the latter country was likely, perhaps soon, to seek an easy victory at the ex-pens e of Roumania to restore the equilibrium of her position,which had been somewhat shaken by recent events in Europe,9.        All three countries were now asking for Allied help.Such help naturally took the form, in the first place, ofa supply of arms, and concrete proposals would have to be examined in due course in that connection.10.      The Balkan question might soon become acute.Preparations would take time, and it was for this reason that the French were anxious to carry out the necessarystudy forthwith,     M. Daladier had already mentioned thismatter to Mr. Chamberlain,  and had urged the French high command to study the military problems involved.     So far,they had only considered the military problem as affecting-Turkey, but later matters might get far beyond the Turkishaspect.

... 27General Gamelin asked whether the British were agreed so far as to the basis of discussion.11. AIR CHIEF MARSHAL NEWALL thanked General Game1in,on behalf of the Chiefs of Staff and of the british war Cabinet, for this welcome opportunity of discussingthis important subject.      He said that the British WarCabinet had certain anxieties regarding the political repercussions of the military policy which,  as theyunderstood it, was being considered by the FrenchGovernment       The Chiefs of Staff were very glad,therefore^ of this q^opportunity for further exploratorystudy w&apos;ith a view to making a report to the British WarCabinet.      In particular, they had been asked by theWar Cabinet  to emphasise the latter&apos;s apprehension asto Italian reactions.      In their view, Italy was likelyto remain !&apos;on the fence&quot;.      If Russia intervened in the balkans,  it was likely that Germany also would intervenelater,  and that Italy would be reluctant at this  stage to take any decision,12. The.British High Command were in complete agreement as to the importance of keeping ajar the doorin South Eastern Europe, but were apprehensive of theconsequences of opening that door, and passing throughit, at the present time.       They felt,  in fact,that for the moment our i-.-tiviti.os should bo confined to unostontatious preparations:;13. GENERAL GAMELIN intervened to say that the Frenchagreed that the moment had not yet come for operations in the Balkans,      they also agreed that the attitudeof Italy was a determining factor, and that the positionof Italy was not yet definite.

14.        AIR CHIEF MARSHAL NEWALL continuing said thatbroadly speaking we had not the resources at the moment for operations in the Balkans.     Until Italy&apos;sneutrality was beyond doubt, there was little or nothingthat could be made available for that area from theMiddle East.      Hence, anything that we could do mustbe at the expense of the Western Front.      The british high Command felt that operations in South eastern europe would be attended by three main difficulties.First,, administrative difficulties:    secondly, shortage ofshipping  - which was at present a cause of thegreatest concern to the British Government;;    and thirdly;-,the shortage of anti-aircraft equipments.      He asked,and General Gamelin agreed, that each of the BritishChiefs of Staff should explain the situation so far ashis own Service was concerned,.15. ADMIRAL SIR DUDLEY POUND said that the smallNaval forces necessary to exercise contraband control in the Mediterranean were the only forces now in that area.      Except for a few cruisers and destroyers, thewhole British Mediterranean Fleet had been withdrawn inorder that, with the ready co-operation of the french fleet, they might achieve two objects:-1. Patrolling of the trade routes throughoutthe world.2. The concentration in the North Sea around the British Isles and off the coasts ofFrance of all remaining forces, to meet&apos;the submarine menace and the intensemine-laying activity,16- He gathered that General Gamelin thought thata campaign in the Balkans was out of the question

unless Italy were neutral,  and we &apos;could rely on her neutrality being maintained.      The british high Co.:: -and entirely endorsed that view.     they thought it would be impossible to maintain thenecessary sea communication for a large force in Thrace,in the face of the heavy air and submarine attack, whichwould be encountered if Italy -were hostile.17. From the Naval point of view, it was necessaryto consider the worst case - i.e. a combination ofRussia and Germany in the Balkans.      In that event,it would be necessary to send a naval force strong enoughto operate against the Russian Fleet into the Black Sea.In addition,  if the Germans were to advance throughthe North of Yugoslavia, they might establishsubmarine ba-.es in that country.     The withdrawal ofNaval forces to the Eastern Mediterranean to meet theabove dangers would be a severe drain on our resources,although not necessarily impossible.18. As regards the question of shipping, thetransport of forces to Thrace would be less difficultthan their subsequent maintenance.     This would be a severe drain on Allied resources of shipping, but wouldnot be impossible.     The whole question would, however,require very careful study.19. As regards administrative preparations, theBritish had Alexandria as a base for the Fleet.      if russia came in, however,  it would be necessary to havebases at Ismid and Smyrna,  and to have them protected against submarines and air attack.      Protection againstsubmarines was perhaps net difficult, but the turks had little anti-aircraft protection at present.

20. ADMIRAL DARLAN shared the same views.      Hesaid that the need for Italian neutrality was evident.He agreed that it would not be possible to transport and maintain a Force in the Balkans if Italy were hostile.     We might have to attack and overcome Italybefore reaching the Balkans.     The shipping problem,moreover, would need very careful study.     There wereheavy claims on it, and it was much reduced.     Finally,he agreed as to the primary importance of Ismid andSmyrna and of the need   o protect them from submarine and air attack.     it would also be advisable to sendin advance the heavy, non-military equipment required, subject to the consent of the powers concerned,21. AIR CHIEF MARSHAL NEWALL then explained theposition as regards British air support.    He said thatif Italy were definitely neutral, the air resources at present in Egypt would be available for use elsewhere.If Germany were the only enemy, they could all be sentto the Balkans.      If however Russia, as well as Germany,were involved,  it might be necessary to divide the airresources into two echelons:    one acting from Anatoliaor Turkey, against Russia, Germany or both:    the othermight have to be sent to Iraq to operate perhaps fromMosul.22. It must also be borne in mind that Russia might attempt penetration through Persia to Afghanistan andand India.     The R.A.F.  in India were at presentextremely weak, and if Russia moved towards India, wouldhave to be reinforced.      Such reinforcement would almost certainly have to come from Egypt.

23. GENERAL VUILLEMIN was in agreement with AirChief Marshal Newall as to the essential importance of italian neutrality.     He thought that, if Italy wereneutral, it might be possible to send a certain numberof French bombardment aircraft from the Western Front:and, in the course of the next two months, probablysome sixty fighter aircraft could also be sent.     the balkan countries friendly to the Allies had a certainnumber of modern fighter aircraft.24. GENERAL IRONSIDE said that he had always thought of the possibilitj&apos;- of entry through the Balkans as a wayof attacking Germany.     The British were now in theprocess of reinforcing the Middle East, &quot;both from the East and from the West.     The difficulty thatwe are now suffering under was that we had been late inbeginning, and that there was lack of troops, lack of administrative organisation, and lack of armament.25. The British were being called upon to send as many troops as possible to France.     This they were nowdoing at full speed.26. The Balkan affair might come about in two ways:either we might go in of our own free will and at, our owntime to attack from that direction:   or alternatively,we might be forced to do so by enemy action.27. He thought that the picture of the Divisionsavailable from the different countries in the Balkans was somewhat optimistic.      If we could encompass a joining upof all those forces,it would be a certain way offinishing the war.     We had, however, unhappy memories ofexpeditions in the Middle East - Salonica, Dardanelles,Constantinople, Syria, Mespotamia.      If we were to startin the Balkans, we must ensure that we did not have the

same difficulties as before.     Failure was then due tothe fact that operations were undertaken withoutsufficient forces and administrative services, and withoutthe necessary determination of the Governments concerned to see tnings through.     He felt that unless we had thepolitical situation absolutely clear, we might fall intothe same trouble.      For example, having got involved inthe 3a.&quot; -   as something might happen in the west to upsc    the whole plan.     There oould &quot;be,therefore, no question of blowing hot and cold on theWestern Front and in the Balkans at the same time.There must be a firm decision on the part of the AlliedGovernments to take up a definite attitude in the two areas and to stick to it.28c        GENERAL GAMELIN entirely agreed as to the needfor a firm Government policy.     He added that therewas no question of seeking a final decision in the Balkans.29. He then went on to discuss the available Frenchland forces.      He said that in Syria, in addition to theforces needed for that place there were three divisions which were now organising and completing..     For the present it was not.possible or even desirable to reinforce the levant any further.      It would merely be a waste ofbadly needed shipping.     Hence, any additional forces for this  theatre must be moved from North Africa orFrance when the time came*     Such forces as were now in theAlps and North Africa were the absolute minimum, so longas the Italian attitude remained uncertain.

30. He thought that it would now be useful to askGeneral Weygand. and General Wavell to give their views,both in the event of:-1.    The enemy taking the initiative with the worstcase of Germany, Russia and Italy all actingtogether.2.    The Allied Governments deciding to take theinitiative themselves in the Balkans - notin order to secure a final decision there,but with a view to helping towards the finaldecision.31. GENERAL WEYGAND said that the first point whichhe wished to make related to blockade. He was convincedthat our blockade in the Balkans was at present entirelyineffective, everything was going -ihvough,    This was of course amost serious matter;    it meant that one very important part of our war policy was failing com- letely.32.       Turning to the military aspect,  he said that thetime might come when we should be forced to intervene in the Balkans.      If we did so without preparation, weshould risk a repetition of the disastrous ventures ofthe last war.      If, on the other hand, we went in on ourown initiative, obviously political and militarypreparation would be an indispensable pro-requisite.33.        In his own view, there was no difference in thecharacter of the preparations required for either   of theabove eventualitieso     The Governments should decideforthwith to make the necessary preparations, so as tobe in a position to act in the Balkans in either case,^Naturally, -all preparations would&apos;have to be of a secretcharacter, diplomatic; the sending of armaments to our allies;    and the administrative arrangements necessaryfor our .own--..fo-jSoes and for their transporto

The Govarrr: -r..t,a would not be committed by these preparations,and could reserve their decision in the matter.    Itwould take at least three months to complete thenecessary preparations.34.       We could do nothing in the Balkans if we did nothave the support of the Balkan Armies themselves, andat present there was certainly  ^definite appeal from them to us to plan their defence.    The Balkans were endeavouring to constitute a neutral bloc, and therewas no question of aay wish to set fire to them;it was merely a question of taking a decision tostrengthen, protect and back them up.  . If a viriledecision were taken by the Allied Governments andconveyed to  the BALKAN countries the effect would beremarkablec35.        Next came the question of arms.     It was essentialto back up diplomatic action with supplies of armaments.Whatever the difficulties, these must be sent.    Sacrificeon our part was essential.    In war-time no one could have all they wantede    In particular it was necessary to begenerous to Turkey, for it was essential to persuade themto waive the &quot;suspensive&quot; clause.36.        Admiral Darlan had spoken of depots.    If we couldpush on discussions with our Allies with a view to thepreparation of Naval, Air and Military bases,  it wouldbe possible to. build .up stocks of materials,  supplies,etc. ready for any eventuality.      The Turks had,  infact, already ^r^eed to .the preparation of Allied

bases, and these could soon be made available for dumping&quot;heavy non-military supplies.    This was a very important feature&quot;of the preparations, and would make for economy of shipping later.37, As regards railways and roads, also, much wouldhave to be done.    In certain areas these would have tobe made;    in others, to be  improved.     these and other matters could be arranged;    they were necessary from the administrative point of view.    They would becarried, out while the Balkans were still at peace,   andwould not lay us open to reproach from the other side.,   v38. GENERAL VYAVELL said that he was in entire agreement with General Weygand.    He would go farther.He felt that it was practically certain that we wouldbe called upon to defend    our Allies and interests inthe Balkans at an early date in 1940.    There was not much time for the necessary preparations if we were toavoid the same difficulties and dangers that weexperienced in the last war.39. When one starts the building up of defense in ahurry, one must start in the rear.    Accordingly we oughtto start with the support of Turkey, and possibly the holding of  Salonica.   Hence, the first thing to do was togive armaments to Turkey.     Without this, it would be very^difficult to pursue the necessary -Staff Conversations&quot; withhero &apos; :.   .

40o        As regards the forces necessary.    Areserve of troops was-&quot;being built up in Egypt;and Palestine9 in the shape of Australian andNew Zealand. Divisions, and a Division of Cavalry,,    Itwould be some tirnes probably the late summer, before these formations were ready for active operations.Meanwhile, a number of troops were already available inEgypt9 if Italy were definitely neutral;    but owing to lack of artillery and of administrative services these units were not at present o;:\-;cj:daod for mobile operations,lie hoped that they might be built up in the next fewmonths.41. If Turkey or the other Balkan Powers were attacked, the first demand -would be likely to befor air support and particularly for modern FighterAircrafto    It was to be presumed, that the enemy wouldas in ?olands attack the rear and bases-        Th^ro were of-course, great demands for modern Fighter Aircraftelsewhere, but he felt that if certain preparations were made it would be possible to reinforce the balkans at short notice with such aircraft without usingmuch shippings42* General Vveygand had emphasised the necessity of keeping all these conversations and preparations secret.He entirely agreed^ but thought that this would bevery difficult to achieveG

43. GENERAL GAMELIN said that it seemed that there wasgetote&amp;aX v^eeaienx that;1.      Everything was governed &quot;by the attitude of Italy,2.      All that could be undertaken at this stage waswork of preparation, but that this could and should be done -5.      It was necessary to supply arms to the Balkans.As regards anti-tank guns,  the French weregcing to study this carefully to see whether afurther supply were possible,  and the question would be examined with General VVeygand before he left.      They would then submit their proposals to the British and would ask theBritish to contribute more anti-aircraftequipmento.4.      The political question was a most delicate one,particularly as to when and how the matter should be broached to Italy:    before thedanger had actually materialised?    or only atthe last moment?44.       GENERAL WEYGAND    said that he thought that it would&quot;be a great mistake to ask Italy&apos;s permission before we didanything in the Balkans in the way of preparations.      Itcould be likened to two soldiers who wanted to fight a duel.If they asked their Colonel for permission,  it wouldcertainly not be given.      Italy could not fail the Axisto the extent of giving her permission.      Hence,  it wasnecessary to leave out Italy until later, and then toexplain to her that defence of the Balkans against bolshevism was on the lines traditionally followed by italian policy...45.      GENERAL GAMELIN   repeated that there was no doubtthat the whole Italian problem must be handled with great care.46.      There was no time now to consider and discuss thedraft Resolutions that ho hac  drawn up.      He would give themto the British Delegation to take away, but now would merely read out the proposed text.He then read out the paper (Annex to these Minutes)and asked the British if they saw any major points ofdivergence.

47o        AIR CHIEF MARSHAL NEWALL replied that there appearedto he no divergence in principle.&apos;    It was clear that theAllies were ,uy?e-e-d  first that it wae necessary to push on with preliminary preparations, and secondly that there   Wasno question of sending any forces to the 3alkans in theimmediate future.    As regards the proposed conversations with greece,  Roumania and Yugoslavia, he    was personallyextremely doubtful as to the possibility of carrying them outin secret.    Moreover he believed that the British and french governments were under an obligation to inform the Italiansof any projected policy in the Balkans,    If Italy were to hear of dumps being formed and other preparations being made without having been informed,  this might have a very serious effect.40,        GENERAL GAMELIN said that he had no knowledge of suchan obligation.    The Fren ch had close relations with roumania and Yugoslavia) and the French High Command had been authorised by their Government to keep in direct touch with those powers,  without any obligation to the Italians,    The italians were so well aware of this,  that in 1935 they made use ofthe French General Staff to communicate with Yugoslavia.At the same time he agreed that the utmost discretion wouldbe needed,  and that naturally we must only confer on thehighest plane^      He engaged net to enter into anycoramitmffihts without informing the British-49.        AIR CHIEF MARSHAL NEWALL was under the impression that the French and British Prime Ministers had agreedto keep Italy informed of their doings in the Balkans.

50.        GENERAL GAMSLIN said that he would clear this up withhis Government.    He was informed by General Lelong thatthe British were under an obligation to inform the Italiansof any troop movements.    The French had no such obligation,but in fact did so,51.       AIR CHIEF MARSHAL NEWALL said that he knew therewas some apprehension in the mind of the British government as to conversations with Balkan countries.    The situation forthe  French   was not the same;    but,  as General Gamelin had said, very great care would be needed regarding the treatmentof the Italians in this question,52.       GENERAL WEYGAKD then mentioned the Bulgarian issue.He described Bulgaria as the kernel of the problem.    germany was known to be sending Bulgaria supplies of aircraft atthe present time.    Bulgaria might greatly impede any action that we might take later.    He himself was always veryperturbed when be heard talk of Bulgariabeing &quot;bought&quot; atthe expense of friends of the Allies and of the Balkans.The greatest guarantee for Bulgaria&apos;s good behaviour was theexistence of the Turkish army.5-3o GENERAL G.J,&apos;IELIN said that there would be everya&amp;varrtage in Generals Weygand and Wave 11 continuing the study of the problem.    There was already contact with the TurkishGeneral Staff.    As far as Salonica was concerned,  it was aquestion of the civilian preparation of the base.    Thiswould include in particular the preparation of port and railway facilities and perhaps the establishment of dumps.The French    would prepare a note on the subject for GeneralPapagos, and would submit it to the British for consideration.The French were fully agreed that at this stage we should go no further than making the necessary preparations.

50.        GENERAL GAvlSLIN said that he would clear this up withhis Government.    He was informed by General Lelong thatthe British were under an Obligation to inform the Italiansof any troop movements,    The French had no such obligation,but in fact did so,.61.       AIR CHIEF MARSHAL NEWALL said that he knew therewas some apprehension in the mind of the British government as to conversations with Balkan countries.    The situation forthe French   was not the same;    but, as General Gamelin had said, very great care would be needed regarding the treatmentof the Italians in this question.,52.       GENERAL WEYGAND then mentioned the Bulgarian issue.He described Bulgaria as the kernel of the problem.    Germany-was known to be sending Bulgaria supplies of aircraft atthe present time.    Bulgaria might greatly impede any action that we might take later.    He himself was always veryperturbed when he heard talk of Bulgariabeing &quot;bought&quot; atthe expense of friends of the. Allies ana of the Balkans.The greatest guarantee for Bulgaria&apos;s good behaviour was theexistence of the Turkish army.53c GENERAL GAMELIN said that there would be every advantage in Generals Weygand and WaveII continuing the study of the problem.    There was already contact with the TurkishGeneral Staff.    As far as Salonica was concerned,  it was aquestion of the civilian preparation of the base.    Thiswould include in particular the preparation of port and railway facilities and perhaps the establishment of dumps.The French    would prepare a note on the subject for&apos; GeneralPapagos, and would submit it to the British for consideration.The French were fully agreed that at. this stage we should go no further than making the necessary preparations.

54.-   AIR CHIEF : marshal.  NEWALL said that the Hfg^yChiefs of Staff would study the draft Resolutions(see Annex to this record), and would submit their recommendations thereon, and the other questionswhich had been raised in the discussion by the british war Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W.L11 December, 1939.

ANNEXo n,TRANSLATION. &quot; &quot; &apos;10th December, 1939.DRAFT CONCLUSIONS SUBMITTED TO THE.INTER-ALL fixed MEETING HELD ON 11TH DECEMBER,1939, ON THE SUBJECT OF THE BALKANPROBLEM.1. The military operations which may be undertaken in the Balkans are conditional upon certain pre-existingpolitical factors,.No Allied intervention in Thrace can be con-templated without the consent of Turkey;    similarly,, nolanding at Salonica is possible unless by agreement with greece and subject to the assent of Italy.Moreover,  if it is decided to undertake operations in the Balkans, the forces to be employed there can onlybe transported and, thereafter, maintained if the attitudeof Italy is at the least one of benevolent neutrality.Italy&apos;s attitude also governs the question of the size of the force the Allies can use for operations in the balkans.2. The problem of Allied intervention in the Balkansvaries in its determining conditions according as weenvisage:(i) Mere assistance to Turkey in the defenceof Thrace;(ii) Assistance to Greece in the defence ofSalonica; or(iii) On the contrary, the constitution of a front including Yugoslavia and thegreater part of Roumania, thispresupposing the previous settlementof the Bulgarian question.3. In the existing political and military circumstances,we can do no more than initiate preparations for allied intervention, namely:(a) Prepare Allied bases in Turkey and at Salonica;(b) Endeavour to secure, under conditions of theutmost secrecy, a discreet form of co-operationbetween the General Staffs of the variousBalkan powers and our own General Staffs, withthe object of settling various points of amilitary character.-l%r

(c) Assist those powers in the economic sphere &quot;bythe grant of credits and, in the armamentssphere, by the supply, more particularly,of anti-tank and anti-aircraft equipment,together with certain aircraft, in so faras we are able to deliver such arms;(d) Undertake a study, on the Allied side, of questions connected with the constitutionof our interventionary forces in the severalhypotheses contemplated with the conditionsof transport and of the protection of transports, and with such rapid assistance as we might be able to give in the Balkansfrom the standpoint of the Air Force.
