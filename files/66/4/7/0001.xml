As this ship approached,many thought she was the Hood or Repulse, owing to the long rising forecastleand overhung bow. At the quarters, normal clearing away procedure was carriedout without any hurry or excitement. Course was presently altered to bring theenemy on the starboard quarter, and the Captain went aft to get a better view,presently remarking : &quot; It is the Deutschland all right.&quot; Word was then passed to provide lifebelts and to load the guns. The smoke floats were ordered over-board, and funnel smoke was also made; both appeared of little effect, as theleading ship shaped course to cross the stern, and a second ship now1 became evident, who continued to approach on the starboard quarter. While the firstship closed rapidly, she signalled :  Stop -What ship Stop and Spei by S/P.2. A few minutes later the nearer enemy opened fire, one round only,which fell 50 yards short on the starboard quarter. This was shortly followedby a salvo of three rounds which fell over on the port bow. About this junctureRawalpindi opened fire from the starboard battery, but almost immediatelyshe was hit in the neighbourhood of the Bridge and tranmsitting station. Siand 2 guns were put out of action, followed, apparently, by S3. S4 fired about five rounds in quarters firing, and then suffered a jammed tube which could[20467] - b
not be extracted. The starboard H.A. gun and crew were also destroyed. the range at this time was estimated to be about 9,000 yards. The ship was heaviijon fire amidships, and the bridge was destroyed. The lights were out betweendecks, and the power on the winches had failed. The ship was still steaming,though some of the engineers and stokers were seen on deck.3. The time was now about 1600 and the fire amidships separated thesurviving parties gathering forward and aft. An attempt was made to floodthe after magazine, but it is thought unsuccessfully, on account of shell-firedamage to valve spindles or flooding pipes. Parties of men under survivingofficers endeavoured to clear away the port boats, the starboard being all damaged or destroyed, but the ship beginning to list rendered this a difficult task with no power available. Parties of men attended to the wounded, and others set aboutdumping cordite and shells overside.4. Lieutenant Qjuin with Lieutenant Chute got two boats away fromforward, but none of the survivors saw what became of them. The Paymasterand Assistant Paymaster were also seen forward, but there is no evidence thatany officers were in these boats.5. One of the two survivors from forward remained in the ship until he was thrown off, when she rolled over to starboard. He then held to anupturned boat with several others (who gradually fell off one by one. He(Fleming) alone remained until he was recovered by the Chitral about 1400 onFriday the 24th. The other man from forward (Dempsey) went aft negotiatingthe fire by climbing down to &quot; B &quot; deck, and joined those on the poop.6. The remaining survivors came from the poop, where Sub-LieutenantOrten and C.P.O. Chandler appear to have done much to encourage theirfellows. These men were freeing woodwork and standing by to take theirchance when a waterlogged boat drifted past. Several men went oversidefor it, and set about bailing. The remainder stayed on board expecting somerescue ship to turn up. Several officers and men tried to gain this boat, but had not the strength. Lieutenant Pickersgill was recognised in the water. Thetime was now about 1650.7. Shortly after this, one of the two enemy ships passed close, stopped, andhailed this boat alongside. It was. not an easy pull with four oars, and although some men were willing to be picked up. C.P.O. Chandler had no intention of getting alongside if he could help it. The boat reached within some 20 yardswhen the enemy received a signal from the other by S/P, whereat she got under wayquickly and disappeared. There was some shouting and jeering from the Germansas they left.   The time was now about 1815.8. Rawalpindi continued to burn, and following a large explosion, thought to have been that of the foremost magazine, rolled over and sank in a pall of blacksmoke at about 2000.9. , This boatload of survivors remained drifting in the vicinity, sleeping inwater-covered bilges because it felt warmer, fortified with condensed milk andbiscuits, with the firm belief that something would turn up to rescue them. About1100 the next day their hopes were rewarded by the arrival of Chitral, who pickedthem up and, cruising around in search of others, about 1400 found Fleming, theone survivor from the for w-ard party, still clinging to the upturned boat.II. Identity of Enemy.10. Survivors first saw two masts only, and later a nearly end-on view with little to pick out except a long forecastle with bows cleaving the water &quot; like a&apos; Tribal &apos; destroyer.&quot;11. Of the ship which crossed the stern and approached the port side ofRawalpindi at a close range nearly abeam, C.P.O. Chandler had the followingclear impression : &quot; A long, rising and flared forecastle with a swan bow. Funnelclose to Bridge, with a sloping cowl. Seaplane on quarter-deck turret.&quot; On being shown photographs and silhouettes, he selected that of Gneisenau as being mostsimilar. The points in which he was in doubt were the superimposed turret for-ward, and he thought the funnel should be closer to the bridge.    Chandler
repeatedly rejected all photographs of Deutschland and class, even those taken from such an angle as to present the view of a long forecastle.12. Other survivors repeated these impressions, and added two turrets for-ward and a short stump mast aft. Several remarked on the noise of the enemy&apos;sengines when in the boat lying off. This was described as that of high-speedengines giving the impression of a steady rhythm rather than a thud-thud.Another termed the noise to be that of big iron wheels rolling, big fly-wheels anda deep, heavy rattling. There was no impression of an increase or decrease innoise when the ship got under way.13. One man (Stone), however, differed from others in that he said thebow of the ship which hailed them was sloping and straight, but not curved.This man selected from photographs that of Hipper shown in left-hand bottomcorner page 225 of Jane&apos;s Fighting Ships, 1939.14. All men said they thought their attackers to have been sister ships, but no one was able to retain a clear impression of the second ship, and it is by nomeans certain whether it was the first or second ship which hailed their boat.Considering what the men had been through, and owing to the darkness, this isnot surprising.III. Plan of the Actjon (see Mooring Board attached).15. Rawalpindi&apos;s sighting report gives bearing of enemy as 280o. Thisbearing was repeated at 1605. As the distance is given as four miles,and the visibility was maximum, this report was probably made some time afterfirst sighting. C.P.O. Chandler&apos;s evidence tends to show that the bearing did not materially alter in the initial stages of the chase.16. Chandler states that the inclination on sighting was, as nearly as hecould judge, 90o to the right, giving a course of 010&quot;, and that the relative bearingwas Red 20&quot;, which makes the Rawalpindi&apos;s course 300&quot;. Rawalpindi thenaltered 180o to starboard, which he estimated by the bearing of the enemy, whichwas then approximately Green 160&quot;. This makes Rawalpindi&apos;s course as 120&quot;.At 1605 Rawalpindi repeated her course as 135&quot;, which tends to confirm the above.17. After the alteration of course, smoke floats were dropped, and fromtheir smoke and the funnel smoke Chandler was quite emphatic that wind was onthe port beam, i.e,, from 030o. This agrees with the Meteorological section, whogive the wind as &quot; probably to the east of North.&quot;   Chitral gives it as Northerly.18. Any estimation of the final course depends on the direction of the wind.When the enemy ship left the boat they were directly to windward of theRawalpindi, Chandler estimates that the ship proceeded to join her consortin a direction at right angles to the bearing of the Rawalpindi, i.e., on a courseof 120&quot; if the wind was, in fact, from 030o. As the consort could not be seen,the final course is uncertain.19. From the above evidence, the initial course of the enemy appears to havebeen between 350&quot; and 030&quot;. The final course cannot be stated, as the leadercould not be seen.  Newcastle might be able to give an idea.IV. Gunnery.20. Rawalpindi. It is not clear how many rounds Rawalpindi fired, butthis could not have been many, as she was hit in the vicinity of bridge andtransmitting station by the second or third salvo. The last order received fromthe T.S. by telaupad appears to have been &quot; Load- load load,&quot; followed by&quot; gunlayers firing.&quot; Supply of ammunition could not be maintained owing tothe very early failure of lights and power to the winches. The hoist was very long, some 50 feet, and personnel appears to have been insufficient for handalternative. S. 1 and 2 guns appear to have been put out of action very soon after, if not simultaneously with, the bridge and T.S. S. 3 gun was silencedsoon after.[20467]
The breech worker of S. 4 gun could not extract a tube after the 4th or5th round. This man said that his gun hit the enemy high up abaft their bridgethree times.The port battery did not come into action at, all.21. Enemy. The enemy which did all the damage was that on the starboardhand. The first round Avas single and fell 50 yards short in line. The nextappears to have been a 3-gun salvo with very small spread which fell over in line.Thereafter Rawalpindi was repeatedly hit with results already described.22. The splashes when seen were not said to be large, although one survivorgave 60 feet as the height of the first. Shell did not appear to burst in the water,but those which hit had very good fragmentation. No very large holes were seen, and some shells were suspected of passing through the ship withoutbursting. Several men report shrapnel to have been used, as there was a hail of old metal, bolts, nuts and nails on the boat deck. Survivors could not be converted into believing that such fragments might have come from the punishment theirown ship was receiving from shell bursting on upper works, &amp;c.23. At one period when the leading ship had worked round the port sideshe fired a shell which burst far above the mast heads, which was taken for astar shell. Yet the flash only was seen, and there was no descending flare as iffrom a parachute.24. Apart from that of the fire, no particular smell was noticeable, but all men complained of extreme dryness of throat.25. No survivor could say from how many points or from whence the enemygun flashes came.   These were simply registered as a large flame.V. Smoke Floats.26. These were lighted and thrown over side, but it is said that theynever burned properly. It is possible they went out, as when first ignited therewas not the usual gush of sparks and heat as from a well-lit float.VI. Personnel.27. In addition to the names mentioned in the above narrative, Petty OfficerHarris was asked if he could in particular commend anybody&apos;s behaviour duringthe action, and with some emotion he said that all had done everything possible and repeated that there was no panic. He then said that Russell, who went onfiring S. 2 gun after the other members of the gun&apos;s crew had been killed, wasa good man. Other than that, several of the ratings mentioned various officers,in particular the Assistant Surgeon, who continued to tend a severely woundedman right up till the time the ship sank, and the Paymaster and the AssistantPaymaster, who were helping to get boats out. The names of Lieutenant Shuteand Sub-Lieutenant Quin were mentioned, and two ratings in particularmentioned Sub-Lieutenant Orton, one saying that the last he had seen of him was handing round cigarettes to his men. The other mentioned that Orton had advised him to jump for it to the water-logged boat, but remained on boardhimself as presumably he saw that more than 30 men had jumped for this boat.
