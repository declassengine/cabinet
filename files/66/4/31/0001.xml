^SECRET. COPY NO. 21^tWEEKLY REPORT NO.16 OF AIR OPERATIONS and intelligence FOR THE WEEK ENDING MIDNIGHT2U.TH DECEMBER,  1939.BOMBER COMMAND.&quot;i *     Operations in the Heligoland Bight? 18th December.The most important operation of the week was the raid into the heligoland Bight on 18th December.     A force of twenty-fourWellingtons was sent out with orders to attack enemy warshipssighted in the Schillig Roads or at anchorages off Wilhelmshaven.Two aircraft were compelled by engine trouble to return withoutreaching their objective.2.     A battleship, one heavy and one light cruiser, and five destroyers were found in Wilhelmshaven harbour and werephotographed, but as the ships were lying in close proximity to buildings, no attempt was made to bomb them.     A very largeliner, probably the Bremen, which was seen lying at Breinerhavenwas also left unmolested, and the only bombs dropped were aimedon four large fleet auxiliaries in the Schillig Roads;    theresults were not observed.3*     Vigorous opposition was encountered both from anti-aircraft fire and from fighter aircraft.      Between thirty and fifty attacks were made within half an hour by aircraft ofvarious types, among which ten Messerschmitt 109&apos;s and fifteenMesserschmitt 110&apos;s were identified in the air at one time.Four Wellingtons were seen to be shot down by fighters, andthree, which were holed in the petrol tanks, flew off in thedirection of Holland.      Two aircraft came down in the sea ontheir way home (the crew of one of these has been rescued) andthree are still missing.      Twelve Messerschmitts, six of eachtype, were shot down by the aircraft which have returned, andit is believed that six others were destroyed by the fire ofthe Wellingtons which are missing,k*      Search for the &quot;Deutschland&quot;,,. 21st December..     Areport was received on December 20th from our Air Attache at/Copenhagen

Copenhagen that a large German warship,- possibly the&quot;Deutschland&quot;f had been seen steaming north from the Great Beltat about b\.30 p.m. that afternoon and was likely to &quot;be off thesouth-west coast of Norway during the following day.      Twenty-four Hampdens set out in search of it at first light on the21st;    while eighteen Wellingtons swept a wide area in thesouth-eastern section df the North Sea and. Coastal Commandreconnaissances were intensified and extended by eleven air-craft toward the Skaggerak,     Additional heavy bomber forces were held in readiness to move at short notice.     Although thewarship in question v/as seen to return southward on the afternoon of the 21st and no concrete results were obtained,  the wholeoperation was a useful and successful test of the possibilityof maintaining large scale combined activity even underextremely adverse weather conditionse5.      Offensive Patrols.      An offensive patrol over Germanseaplane bases was maintained nightly except for the nights ofthe 21st and 22nd when it was interrupted by bad weather. .   Onthe night of the 23rd, patrols were extended in a propagandaraid over Bremen and Hamburg, during which over a million leaf-lets were dropped.      The opposition encountered was never serious and was limited to searchlights and to scattered anti-aircraft fire.      Bombs were dropped on flare paths and over navigation&apos;lights seen at sea.      No bombs were dropped on land.      Theresults of this bombing were naturally difficult to observedirectly;    but evidence is accumulating that since the institution of these patrols there has been a very marked diminution ofGerman air activitjr over the North Sea during the hours ofdarkness.6*     Reconnaissance Flights.      Regular daylightreconnaissance was also maintained over the Heligoland Bight;but only small enemy naval units were seen.      On the 2l?.th therewas a sharp encounter with a party of small vessels which opened/heavy

heavy anti-aircraft fire on a formation of seventeenWellingtons.     This v/as countered by bombs, but the day wascloudy and observation of results was indefinite.7.      ADVANCED AIR STRIKING FORCE.      Regular fighter patrols were maintained with no outstanding incident except the attempt on the 22nd December to surprise a section of three Hurricanes.A formation of Messerschmitt 109&apos;s, probably seven or eight in number, dived on them suddenly from cloud and two Hurricaneswere lost.      One Messerschmitt is believed to have been shot down and another badly damaged, perhaps destroyed, but so farno wreckage has been found.FIGHTER COMMAND.8.      In spite of the increased enemy activity over theNorth Sea early in the week few enemy aircraft crossed theBritish coast.      One hundred and six patrols, involving three hundred and forty-seven aircraft, were sent up and a number of friendly aircraft were identified.      The only contact with enemy aircraft v/as with two Heinkels off the Firth of Forth onthe 22nd December.      The enemy were severely mauled, but dis-appeared into a cloud bank and were not actually seen to fall into the sea.9.      Special patrols of Blenheim fighters were establishedoff the East Coast on the 20th in order to protect the Lowestoftfishing fleet, and have been regularly maintained except whenhindered by fog.      Since their establishment there have been no enemy attacks on fishing vessels, and no contact with enemy aircraft has been made.10.     In co-operation with Coastal Command and with the air component of the Expeditionary Force, Fighter Command has provided escorts daily, except when hampered by fog, for leaveboats bringing troops from Prance.     Twelve patrols of three&apos;aircraft each were flown but no enemy aircraft were encountered.

k.11.    In this and in previous weekly summaries it will benoted that the mmfoer of Fighter Command patrols sent out isvery large in comparison with the number of enemy aircraftintercepted.      It must be remembered that every aeroplaneobserved which is not at once identified requires investigation by Fighter Command and that under present conditions a high proportion of the supposed &quot;raiders&quot; subsequently turn out tobe friendly..      It will be appreciated, therefore, that themeasure of success achieved by the Fighter Command patrols,and the magnitude of the burden which this Command isshouldering, are much greater than would appear from* thenumber of enemy aircraft intercepted.COASTAL COMMAND.12.    Fifty-five routine and ninety-five special patrols were flown during the week and escort was provided for convoyson forty-seven occasions.      In addition, special anti-submarine patrols were maintained for leave boats bringingBritish troops from France.      There were four encounters with enemy aircraft, in which shots were exchanged without decisiveeffect.      On one of these occasions the enemy was in the act of attacking a trawler when disturbed by one of our aircraft on convoy duty anddriven off.13.    Mines were detected and reported on eight occasions.Submarine activity seems to have been on a reduced scaleduring the week;    only one suspicious submarine was seen andas it was found in a British submarine lane it was notattacked.1h,    On the 20th December aircraft of the Command were responsible for the rescue of six survivors of the Swedishship ?.!Llstor&quot; from a raft on which they were adrift far out inthe North Sea./AIR

On the 17th and 18th therewere very widespread attacks by German aircraft on defencelessvessels, mainly drifters.    Thirty-one such craft were attacked in two days, seven were sunk and four damaged.186 The attacks were usually made by land planes acting in pairs and using numerous small bombs as well as machine-gunfire.    The bombing was not conspicuously accurate even fromlow altitudes.    The attacks were organised over a wide area and were rarely close enough to the English coast to be counteredby the ordinary fighter defences.

19. The Wilhelmshaven raid produced much usefulinformation about the organisation of the German air defences,in particular as to the disposition of Flak ships and otheranti-aircraft units, and as to the capabilities of the newMesserschmitt 110,   A high opinion has &quot;been formed of the speed and manoeuvrability of tMo aircraft, hut the lossessuffered by the Wellingtons during the operation are to be attributed more to the concentration in one area of a largenumber of German fighters than to the technical characteristics of the enemy ,aircraft engaged,,    A careful study is being madeof German fighter tactics and of the general layout of the defensive system.,20o There has also been a brief encounter over theNorth Sea with the new Junker       bomber; and there is evidencethat Heihkel lll&apos;s and possibly also Dornier 17&apos;s (bothlandplanes) have been adapted for mine-laying.210 Our Air Attache at Stockholm reports that the delivery of eight naval reconnaissance aircraft promised to sweden by Germany has been delayed.    There have on the otherhand been substantial sales of German aircraft and aero-enginesto Holland.OPERATIONS BY THE FRENCH AIR FORGE.22. During the past week the activities of the French air Force have greatly increased.,    Reconnaissances were made over the lines and some extended to considerable depth intoenemy territory,,   During the night of 22nd December, leaflets were dropped over Munich and also over Eppingen and Pforzheim.Fighter aircraft made over four hundred flights, but wihoutengaging the enemy,,/THE

THE FINNISH WAR.23. Russian air activity has been intensified duringthe past week and on the 19th there were widespread air raids on the principal Finnish towns0   Many aircraft were involved,hut the bombing seems to have been ill-organised and inaccurate,and little damage of military importance was done,    Russianstrategic bombing has, in the ,main, been concentrated on the single supply road to Petsamo from the rail head at Rovaniemi,on the railway running North West from Helsinki, on Finnishaerodromes, and on the Mannerheim Line.24. It is reported that the Russians have increased their air strength in Estonia from two hundred and fifty to five hundred,  and have concentrated about one hundred and fiftyhombere and one hundred fighters on the Finnish frontier.    Theloss of thirty-six S.B. bombers and one 1,15 fighter is wellauthenticated.25. It is estimated that the Finnish first line strength on the 8th December was fifty-four Army Co-operation,fifty-nine fighters, thirteen coastal reconnaissance aircraft,eighteen bombers, a total of one hundred and fourty-four,mainly of BrxTish types, which does not include aircraft on orderat the beginning of the war.    The Finnish bombing force iswell placed for a strategic blow at the Murmansk Railway, onwhich the whole Russian effort in the Northern sector depends.It has already made some determined raids and done a certainamount of damage to the line, but wastage is inevitable,especially at this season, and bomber reinforcements are most urgently required.    It is impossible to give accuratefigures for Finnish losses, but out Air Attache at Stockholmreports that five out of the eighteen Finish bombers are nowout of action.

26. Two squadrons have been organised in Sweden, of twelve Gladiators and twelve Hawker Harts,  equipped with skis,and are ready to move with the Swedish Volunteer Force to theneighbourhood of Ulea when the approval of the Swedish Govern-ment can be secured.    Apparently two of the Italian aircraftordered before the war have reached Finland, and six are ontheir way: the fate of *the others is uncertain,    The purchaseof some seventy Fokker planes is being completed in Holland,and arrangements are in progress for the receipt 6*f aircraft and supplies via Bergen and Narvik,NORWAY.270 It is reported that the-Norwegian air patrolof the Kattegat is to be discontinued as the aircraft arerequired to reinforce the patrol on the Narvik route north ofKristiansundn    It is impossible at the moment to withdrawaircraft for this purpose from the far Northern K*ea round Tromso.
