NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.THE destruction of the German pocket battleship, Admiral Graf Spee, hasterminated German raiding activities in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceansfor the time being. The system of diversive routeing of merchant ships and thecovering by strong naval &quot;forces of the focal points of trade ensured that the admiral Graf Spee&apos;s depredations could not at any time assume seriousproportions.H.M. Submarine Ursula sank a German light cruiser of the &quot; Koln &quot;class on the 14th December just south of Heligoland. Detailed reports now received from H.M. Submarine Salmon, together with German announcements,make it clear that she torpedoed the Blucher, as well as the Leipzig.Although the weather conditions have generally been more favourable for aircraft than in the preceding week, there has apparently been a diminution inmine-laying by air. On the other hand, on the 17th and 18th December numerousattacks were made by aircraft on trawlers, drifters and merchant vessels off theEast Coast and in the North Sea, which caused some casualties both to ships andto personnel.The first Canadian Troop Convoy of five ships, referred to in last week&apos;resume, carrying 336 officers and 7,088 other ranks, arrived in the Clyde on the17th December.Consequent on several reports of German merchant ships sailing from neutral harbours, the Northern Patrol has been reinforced, and ships have been moved to intercept German ships nearer their points of departure. Two ships, theS.S. Dusseldorf and the S.S. Columbus, have been intercepted.Only two merchant ships, both neutrals, have been sunk by U-boats.Home Waters.2. The main body of the Fleet provided covering support for the CanadianTroop Convoy until its safe arrival on Sunday, the 17th December.Since that date a force of capital ships has been at sea to give cover to theNorwegian and Narvik Convoys. The number of ships on the Northern Patrolbetween Greenland and the north of Scotland was substantially increased by theaddition of armed merchant cruisers, and the patrol was again extended to includethe Denmark Strait, which remains navigable although restricted by ice.3. H.M. Submarine Salmon having now returned, it is possible to amplifythe reports of her attacks given in last week&apos;s Resume.Her attack on the U-boat on the 4th December was made at a range of5,000 yards, and she had some difficulty in closing to that range. She fireda full salvo of six torpedoes, one of which hit the U-boat amidships.This sighting gave valuable information about U-boat movements, andSalmon did not report it until a week later when she was in a differentgeographical position.It is confirmed that the U-boat was of the ocean-going type.4. On the 12th December Salmon, whilst diving deep on account of airpatrols sighted earlier in the day, heard a ship on her hydrophones, and on coming to periscope depth saw the Bremen. She carefully examined her for signs of guns, but seeing none she came to the surface, manned her gun and ordered theBremen to stop by signal from flashing lamp. The signal was not replied to andas the Bremen did not stop, the order was given to fire a round across her bow.Before this was fired aircraft were observed to be approaching, and Salmon divedto avoid them. It is reported that the captain of the Bremen stated that he didnot see the Salmon, whilst the first officer said that they went to gun actionstations.5. On the 13th December, 2 or 3 German heavy ships, resembling theScha.rnh or st, Gneisenau and Admiral Scheer, were sighted by Salmon about miles away, steering to the westward. With them were four cruisers thought to be two &quot; Hippers,&quot; the Leipzig and one &quot; Koln &quot; class. The cruisers alteredto the southward and so passed within range of the Salmon, which fired at theLeipzig, in the centre of the line, with a &quot; Hipper &quot; ahead and astern of her.
Three minutes after firing one loud explosion was heard and two more abouta minute later. Three minutes afterwards the remaining three torpedoesexploded, presumably on hitting the bottom after finishing their run. Fromsubsequent calculations it was considered that the first hit was on the Leipzig andthe two others on the cruiser astern of her. Salmon was unable to check the damage as. when she was regaining periscope depth, she was depth charged andhad to take evasive action. She found an oil patch 4 miles square in the areafourteen hours later.6. On the 14th December H.M. Submarine Ursula on patrol off Heligolandsighted a German cruiser of the &quot; Koln &quot; class with three destroyers which passedoutside range. Ah hour later a second &quot; Koln &quot; class appealed, screened by six destroyers and was attacked. Four torpedoes were fired and two of these wereheard to hit, the explosions being very heavy and breaking many lights in theUrsula. Forty-five minutes later the target had disappeared. The screeningdestroyers were active round the position and were though.! to be recoveringobjects from the sea. They did not counter-attack, and it is possible that theywere mine-layers without depth charges.Aircraft reported one battleship, one cruiser and three destroyers south ofHeligoland steering toward Wilhelmshaven on this day.7. On the 14th December, whilst the north-bound East Coast Convoy waspassing the Tyne, explosions occurred on two oil tankers and these, possibly dueto the depth of water, which was considerable for mining operations, were reported as torpedoes. H.M.S. Kelly and Mohawk were ordered from the Tyneto assist in hunting the submarine. Three hours later H.M. Trawler JamesL-udford blew up, and it was realised that the casualties were caused by mines and not torpedoes, and the hunt was cancelled. H.M.S. Kelly later struck a mineaft, when in 40 fathoms. There were no casualties and she was towed into the tyne and docked. Two officers and fifteen ratings were lost in the JamesLudford. The discovery of the minefield delayed the East Coast traffic and causedother casualties, principally to neutral ships, before its position could be notified to shipping.It appears probable that the movements of the German Fleet on the13th December were connected with the laying of this minefield. H.M. TrawlersEvelina and Sedgefiy, which were working in this area, are overdue and presumed lost, the casualties being 2 officers and 21 ratings. It is possible Sedgefly mayhave been sunk by air attack.8. On the 17th December German air forces carried out attacks on trawlers and merchant ships over a wide area in the North Sea, off the East of Britainand in the Dover Straits. Twenty-six attacks were carried out by bomb and machine gun, usually by both. Twenty attacks were made on trawlers, of whichthe great majority were ordinary fishing vessels; only two, H.M. TrawlersDromio and Loch Oskaig, were employed on patrol duties. The merchant shipsattacked were not in convoy, and though convoys were at sea they were notattacked; in fact, it would appear that they were avoided. Attacks took place between 10 a.m. and 4-30 r.m.   Four trawlers and one small coaster were sunk.Further attacks of the same nature were made on the 18th December, butonly nine vessels, were involved, all being trawlers or drifters, includingH.M. Patrol Drifters Learig and Alifred. The attacks took place off theScottish Coast about noon. On the 19th December two trawlers were attacked in the vicinity of the Shetlands and news of a further attack, possibly on the20th December, conies from survivors landed in Norway. Casualties so farreported amount to ten killed, one missing and eleven wounded, none of which occurred in H.M. ships. The attacks appear to have been carried out with considerable brutality, survivors being fired at whilst swimming in the water.Details of the losses and vessels attacked are given in Appendices I and II.9. Early on the morning of the 17th December an incident occurred in theCanadian Troop convoy which fortunately had no serious result, but whichillustrates the difficulties of operating at sea without lights on a dark night.The Empress of Britain, the rear ship of a column of three, at 5 a.m. saw a vividflash of light and sparks ahead of her which revealed her next ahead, theAquitania, and an unknown ship coming straight down the line; she was justable to avoid the stranger. The ship concerned was the Samaria, outward bound,r20522] b 2
and sailing independently. She had not only scraped down the Aquitania&apos;s side,but also down the side of her next ahead, fortunately in neither case causingserious damage.10. The deep minefield off Folkestone was further reinforced and thefirst lay of a shallow minefield off the Thames was completed.Foreign Waters.11. The main action between H.M. Ships Aja-x, Achilles and Exeter andthe Admiral Graf Spee lasted for 81 minutes at ranges of 19,000 to 8,000 yards and started at 6 a.m. (as reported in last week&apos;s Resume). After Exeter had been forced to discontinue the action, the Ajax and Achilles found themselves runningshort of ammunition. They withdrew to shadowing distance and fire wasexchanged intermittently during the remainder of the day. It would, therefore,appear probable that lack of ammunition was a determining factor in the decision that the A admiral Graf Spee should not force another engagement.During her cruise of approximately three months the A admiral Graf Speesank nine ships, of a total tonnage of 50,000. In the last war, the Emden duringher cruise sank sixteen ships of 71,000 total tonnage, besides capturing sevenothers, four of which she released and three of which she used for auxiliarypurposes.12. H.M.S. Despatch seized the S.S. Dusseldorf (4,930 tons) in prize off the chilean Coast on the 15th December. Prompt action by the boarding partyprevented the crew scuttling the ship, and the prize crew are now taking theship to Kingston via the Panama Canal.13. The S.S. Columbus (32,565 tons), Germany&apos;s third largest liner, was stopped by a British destroyer off the Coast of Virginia. The crew set the ship on fire, opened the sea cocks and took to the boats; 597 survivors &quot;were picked up bythe United States cruiser Tuscaloosa. It is understood that she started with630 Germans, 17 Chinese and 3 Italians on board.The S.S. Arauca (4,400 tons) was intercepted by H.M.S. Orion in the earlyhours of the 20th December, but was able to escape into territorial waters offPort Everglades, Florida, where she remains with H.M.S Orion and a destroyerwatching outside.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week 392 vessels have been convoyed, 2 of these beingneutral, 19 French and the remainder British. The total number of shipsconvoyed is now over 5,000, the percentage losses remaining at one-fifth of 1 percent, i.e., a total of 12 ships since the beginning of the war. Forty-two destroyers and 14 escort vessels have been employed on escort duty during the week, inaddition to several heavier ships which acted as ocean escorts.Anti-Submarine Operations.15. The U-boats have shown little activity during the period, and althoughfifteen anti-submarine attacks have been carried out, in many cases &quot; non-submarine &quot; targets (such as wrecks) are suspected to have been the cause.Whilst two attacks appear hopeful, no definite evidence of their success has beenobtained. One of these attacks took place off Buchan Ness and the other off the orkneys.German Fleet Intelligence.16. An aerial reconnaissance carried out on the 18th December showed thefollowing ships in Wilhelmshaven dockyard :- 1 Battle cruiser in the building basin.1 Pocket Battleship alongside.1 Cruiser (possibly Emden) in dock.5 Destroyers.
A battleship was reported passing through the Belt on the evening of the20th December, but she apparently returned the following morning.A report states that the Admiral Scheer left Wilhelmshaven for a longcruise on the 12th December. It is further reported that three destroyers are inWilhelmshaven damaged by mines, and that the Leipzig has a hole in herbottom, and also in the fore part of the ship, caused by torpedoes.There are several indications that the battle-cruiser Gneisenati took part inthe sinking of H.M.S. Rawalpindi on the 23rd November.German Mine Laying.17. In addition to the Tyne minefield mentioned under &quot; Home Waters,&quot; a ship, purporting to be the Danish S.S. Jaegersborg, was sighted by aircraftapparently laying mines 100 miles to the west of Lister Light (S. Norway) onthe trade route usually followed by neutral ships. The locality has been declareddangerous. Mining by German aircraft was reported on the 17th, 19th and 20th,but only by individual machines, and no large-scale operation has been reported.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.18. In addition to the losses by air attack. 4 British and 13 neutral losses have been reported during the period. The British losses were all by mine; 2 ships(13,000 total tonnage) are certain losses, but the other two (10,000 tons) are capableof salvage. The neutral losses comprised 2 ships sunk by submarines, one by gun-fire and the other by torpedo. The remaining eleven were all mined in the north sea off the East Coast, and the majority off the Tyne. All were small ships, andthe total tonnage was just under 15,000 tons. With the exception of a Greek anda Belgian ship, they belonged to the Scandinavian countries.Details are given in Appendix I and charts are attached showing weeklytonnage losses for British, Allied and Neutrals. Average losses from all causes(including Marine casualties) come to 30,000 tons weekly, against an averageincrement of 26,000 tons.Economic Warfare.British Contraband Control.19. During the week 26,400 tons of cargo were seized, including 15,100 tonsof ores and metals and 8,950 tons of petroleum products. Invergoroon Contra-band Control Base is now in operation.German Contraband Control.20. It appears that the German control is reducing the coastal shipping of the Scandinavian and Baltic Powers. Five more Danish vessels were seizedby the Germans off Jutland and taken into a German port on the 16th December.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.21. Enemy activity has shown a considerable increase on the Rhine-Moselle Front, where several carefully prepared local attacks have been launchedon French positions. These attacks, which were usually supported by artilleryfire, were all successfully repulsed.The Rhine Front has been quiet throughout the week.22. Contradictory reports regarding the grant of Christmas leave in theGerman Army have been received. On the one hand, it is said that leave is tobe cancelled, while on the other it is reported that arrangements have been madefor the running of special leave trains from Aachen and Saarbrucken. Whileit would be unwise to assume that leave has been stopped throughout the Army,it appears likely that leave is being restricted in certain units.
German- Troo-p Movements.23. Reports of troop movements towards both north-west and south-east germany have been received. One report indicated considerable troop move-ment between Emden and Rheine on the 7th December, the transfer of motorizedand armoured troops from the Ruhr to the Kleve area on the 12th December,and the arrival of tanks in the Trier-Saarburg area.Eeports have also been received that troops from the Western Front arebeing sent eastwards. In one it is stated that between ten and twelve divisionsleft for Lower Austria between the 26th November and 5th December. Thereis no confirmation of this, however, and the move would have involved between640 and 768 trains. It is also reported that the formation of a new operationalgroup, to be known as the South-Eastern Army Group, has been commenced.This group is to be garrisoned in Styria, Carintilia, Lower Austria -andSlovakia. The formation of such a group, if the information, is correct, neednot provoke undue disquiet, as it may have been formed both for internal security duties and also to remind the countries of South-Eastern Europe that the militarymight of Germany is always at hand.Situation opposite the Dutch, Belgium and Luxemburg frontiers.24. It is stated that bridging material is being concentrated in theKrefeld, Rheydt and Trier areas, that petrol storage accommodation in the siegfried Line, between Aachen and Krefeld, has recently been filled to capacity and that heavy artillery has been sent to Dalheim and Aachen; alsothat work has been carried out on the telephone and railway systems oppositethe Dutch and Luxemburg frontiers, and that petrol dumps have been formed in the Trier area. Too much significance should not be attributed to these reports.It might be. fair to sum up the situation as follows : Work of a militarynature is being carried out, but so far there appears to be nothing abnormal.There has been a fair amount of military movement, part of which only can be attributed to the redistribution of troops and reliefs. Present information doesnot, however, show that there has been any material increase in the number oftroops in the area. On the other hand it must be borne in mind that therehas been no appreciable decrease in the German forces opposite the Dutch,Belgian and Luxemburg frontiers since the middle of November, and there is every reason to suppose that the troops in that area are ready for any actionwhich may be required of them.German Fortifications.25. On the outbreak of war aerial photographs taken from Trier north-wards to Kalden Kirchen, twelve miles north-west of Munchen-Gladbach,showed a continuous belt of wire and numerous concrete pill-boxes and anti-tankobstacles. These defences, however, did not reach further north than Erkelenz.From Erkelenz northwards to Kalden Kirchen few forts and little wire couldbe seen. Construction was in progress throughout the length of the line, andin particular in the Eifel district, where anti-tank defences were being constructed at high speed.Later information shows that, during the early part of September, most&quot;work was being done in the area south of Trier between the Rivers Moselleand Saar, and on the Saar front. Early, in October it was reported that fieldworks were being constructed to the&quot; north of Kalden Kirchen on the lineGeldern, Goch, Kleve, to Bocholt, and later in the month that concrete works were being built to support this line. This has been confirmed by recent airphotographs. It was also reported that a third fortified line was being prepared25-30 miles in fear of the front line to block the main avenues of approach.Up to the present, six centres of resistance have been located in this line.Soviet Russia.26. Apart from the Russo-Finnish hostiliti- s there is little to report, though there have been some vague rumours of aoti icy on the Bessarabian frontier.Reports that troops withdrawn from Poland early in December were being
concentrated at Odessa have not been confirmed, and it is impossible to assess the significance of these alleged movements, as there are no details of the numberof troops involved. Further reports that troops have been moved to the Turkishfrontier have been received, but it is not known whether these are reinforcementsor merely replacements.Sweden.27. The partial mobilization carried out in Sweden has brought some85,000 men to the colours.General Thronell has been appointed commander of the Volunteer force which is proceeding to Haparanda, although the Swedish Government, which stillfeels that assistance to Finland should be given as inconspicuously as possible&apos;has not yet openly sanctioned the despatch of volunteers and material. Indeed,it has not yet amended the law allowing only one shift in the armament industry,although the Finns have persuaded the Swedish Trades Unions to agree to twoor three shifts. Growing discontent with the cautious policy of the Governmentis reported among all classes of the population. The opinion is widely held thatthe united forces of Finland. Sweden and Norway would have a strong chanceof success against Russia, and that it is only the possibility of German inter-vention which is preventing the Government from adopting a more forcefulpolicy.Norway.28. Although the general public are nervous as to Soviet intentions towardsNorway, and the Ministry of Defence is greatly concerned about the position inthe north, the Minister for Foreign Affairs professes to fear no immediate danger.This attitude appears to spring from a desire to avoid measures which mightoffend Russia, since there is little doubt that Norway is as certain as Swedenthat the Soviet advance in Finland is aimed against the whole of NorthernScandinavia.Meanwhile, the garrison of Kirkenes in the extreme north-east has been considerably increased, as this area is directly threatened by the Russian forces operating from Petsamo.Italy.29. Reports tend to confirm that leave up to a month is being granted to20 per cent, of the army at a time. Some leave to Italy is also being granted tothe white garrison of Libya, but on a more restricted scale. The total effectivesof the Italian army, excluding discharged reservists and troops on leave, are now estimated to number some 700,000. Training continues, with a large number ofreservist N.C.Os. still retained under arms.The Balkan States and Turkey.30. In Roumania no measures of demobilisation have yet been announcedand work on three lines of defence against a Soviet attack is being activelypursued.   The exact position of these lines is not known.The Bulgarian Army, at a strength of some 120,000 men, is expected to bereduced after Christmas to about 70,000. The other armies of the Balkan Statesand Turkey remain at their previous strengths : Yugoslavia : about 300,000 (reduced by half since the autumn).Greece : about 90,000 (reduced by half since the autumn).Turkey : about 600,000 (unchanged).Reinforcements from India.31. Four animal transport companies from India are expected to arrive atMarseilles on the 26th December. Six hundred mules from India, which willbe taken over in Egypt by the personnel of the two Cypriot animal transport companies, are due at Port Said about the 29th December.
Far East.32. The Japanese have closed the West River and its eastern arm, thePearl (or Canton) River, to navigation until the end of December, owing toimpending military operations. The nature and extent of these operations is uncertain, but there have been indications that Japanese reinforcements are proceeding to South China.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.Operations against German Naval Forces.33. On the 18th December twenty-four Wellingtons of No. 3 (Bomber) Groupwere ordered to attack enemy warships located in the Schillig Roads, and ifnone were observed to proceed to Wilhelmshaven. During the outward flighttwo aircraft were forced to turn back owing to engine trouble.The remainder found no suitable objective in the Schillig Roads, but sightedone battleship, one pocket battleship, one cruiser and five destroyers inWilhelmshaven Harbour. The location of the ships in relation to buildingscompelled our aircraft to withhold their attack. Six bombs wore dropped later on four large auxiliaries, but results could not be observed.The formation was attacked from 1300 to 1345 hours between HELiGOLANnand Jade Roads by approximately 15 M.E. 110 and 10 M.E. 109 fighters. Itis substantiated by crews that six M.E. 110s and six M.E. 109s were shot downduring the attack. It is probable that the enemy casualties were higher, as itis believed that missing aircraft accounted for further fighters. Four of our aircraft were shot down by fighters, and three more were seen heading forHollano with petrol streaming from their tanks. A further three aircraft are missing and two landed in the sea on the return flight. The crew of one of thelatter aircraft has been landed at Grimsby.34. On the 14th December five Whitleys took off to locate enemy surfacewarships in a specified area of the Southern Heligoland Bight; all machinesreturned safely to their bases.  Their reports were negative.35. Twenty-four Hampdens and eighteen Wellingtons left on the morning of the 21st December to locate and attack a German Naval Force reported to thesouth-west of the Norwegian Coast. The force in question was not located andwas later reported to be returning to the Baltic, east about. The flight was madeunder difficult conditions. All aircraft returned safely except three. Two ofthe latter forced landed in the sea, all the personnel being saved except oneairman who is missing. The third aircraft crashed on landing and the crew were killed.36. Special sweeps and routine reconnaissances by bomber forces were carried out on the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 20th over various specified areas ofthe North Sea, three to twelve aircraft being employed on each occasion. nothing of special interest was reported until the 20th December, when six mine-sweeperswere seen 22 miles north-west of Horns Reef, and five mine-sweepers 80 miles west of Sylt; ten 500-lb. bombs were dropped but no direct hits observed.Continuous Reconnaissance and Offens-ive Patrols over Enemy Seaplane Bases.37. During the week under review this operation was carried out nightlyby Whitley aircraft over the German seaplane bases in the Borkum, nor deney,Sylt areas. Only on one night was the weather so unfavourable that the patrolhad to be cancelled. Any lights seen on the water, calculated to assist seaplanesin taking off, were systematically bombed. Ou the 14th December five bombs were dropped on seaplanes in the vicinity of Rantum. One bomb was dropped on a ship at the west end of the Island of Borkum and one bomb on a Flak ship.It is not known if hits were made. On thel9th December no bombs were dropped,although a German or German inspired report states that Sylt was bombed.On the night of the 20th December six bombs were dropped along lights in
Westerland Bay, Sylt. Special care has been taken to avoid dropping bombs on land. These operations seem to be proving successful in restricting theenemy&apos;s use of mine-laying aircraft at night, as during the week very few reportsindicating mine-laying operations have been received. All our aircraft engagedhave returned safely to their bases. On numerous occasions our aircraft havebeen engaged by heavy anti-aircraft fire, but so far no fighters have been encountered.38. On the 14th December a special day reconnaissance of seaplane bases at nor deney, Borkum, Rantum, List and Hornum was carried out by twoBlenheims of No. 107 Squadron; a number of excellent photographs were taken,which made it possible to identify enemy aircraft at four of the bases in question.Fighter Command.39. On the 14th December enemy aircraft operating oft&apos; our coast were reported on nine occasions. In the evening an aircraft was plotted about 14 miles south of the Isle of Wight, where it circled for ten minutes. No enemy aircraftcrossed the coast and no interceptions were made.During the 15th and 16th December further minor raids were plotted, and enemy aircraft on the morning of the 16th were reported to be operating somedistance off the coast between Flamborough Head and the Humber. fighters were sent up to investigate, but no contact was made. In the evening of thesame day aircraft were plotted within 10 miles of the coast in the Harwich area,where they remained for approximately an hour. Bad weather prevented our fighters taking off.40. On the 17th seven plots were identified as enemy, three of which were intercepted by fighters. The first attack was carried out by a section of No. 41Squadron 20 miles north-east of Whitby, 800 rounds being fired when the enemy aircraft, a Heinkel 115, pulled sharply into the clouds and was lost. The second attack was carried out .10 miles North of the Amble, and the third over the humber Estuary. Both enemy aircraft disappeared in clouds, and the resultof the attacks are not known.On the 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st December enemy aircraft were again plottedover the North Sea on a number of different occasions; our fighters were not ableto make any contacts.41. Nearly all the plots referred to consisted of one or two aircraft only,which were some miles out to sea, and in only one or two cases were the plotsshown as crossing the coast. During the whole of this period our fighters were greatly hampered by bad visibility, especially on the 17th December, whennumerous small raids were plotted over the sea, mostly late in the afternoonwhen the light was fading. On the 20th December a special patrol over the fishing area off the Norfolk coast was carried out by 4 Blenheim Fighters, but no enemy aircraft were sighted.Coastal Command.42. All the usual anti-submarine patrols, reconnaissances, searches andconvoys were undertaken during the week. In addition some 70 special searchesand reconnaissances were flown.A number of floating mines were located and reported after attempts hadbeen made to explode them with machine gun fire. On the 16th December, the danish S.S. Jaegersborg was sighted 90 miles west-south-west of Lister. Thisvessel appeared to be laying mines, and as eight mines were located all ships inthe vicinity were warned.On the 16th December, a submarine was attacked by an aircraft from612 Squadron and two bombs were dropped; no damage was observed. submarines were sighted on the 17th and 20th December, but no attacks could be made.On Sunday, the 17th December, special patrols were flown over the Clyde inorder to give additional protection to the Canadian convoy which arrived that morning.[20522] c
As a result of enemy attacks on shipping, three Hudsons located ten menin an open boat and a drifter was directed to the spot. On another occasiona Hudson sighted one man on a square wooden raft, who was picked up bythe Gronland.On the 16th December a Hudson sighted a raft with six men, flying a redand white pennant in position 115 miles east by north of Newcastle. Uponreceiving this report a destroyer was despatched and an Anson was detailed to locate the raft and direct the destroyer to the position. The rescued men weresurvivors from the Swedish ship Listor.Coastal Command aircraft sighted very few enemy aircraft during the weekand only in one case was an attack made, the result of wdiich is not known.43. From the outbreak of hostilities up to the 10th December statistics ofthe operation of Coastal Command aircraft include the following totals :(i) 26,220 flying hours.(ii) 55 submarines attacked, 20 of which have probably been destroyed or damaged (this includes two attacks in co-operation with naval vessels),(iii) 371 ships convoyed, involving the employment of 1,179 aircraft.Operations in France.44. Owing to unfavourable weather conditions on the Western Front, theoperations of the advanced air striking force and the R.A.F. Field Force Com-ponent have been restricted. A number of patrols have been carried out, but nocombats have been reported. There are no operations to report of any special interest.  The operations of the French Air Force were similarly restricted.German Air Force Activity.Bombers.45. During the past few days German aircraft have been bombing and machine-gunning shipping off the East Coast. On the 17th December a total of twenty-four small ships were attacked, four of which were sunk and fourdamaged. On the 18th December seven more were attacked and three sunk. the units engaged in these attacks have not been identified with certainty, but it isknown that land planes have taken a major part. The number of bombs dropped as many as fifteen by one aircraft shows that comparatively small bombs arebeing dropped, which are effective against small ships.Bombing practice on moving targets in the Baltic by German bomber unitshas previously been reported, and these recent attacks on shipping are an inexpen-sive method of putting into practice the experience gained.Flights to and from East Prussia by aircraft from different bomber units in Western Germany have already been reported. It is now thought that thereis some significance in these flights apart from training, and that a bomber unit(some forty aircraft) has moved from Western Germany to East Prussia.Fighters.46. Previous raids on the Heligoland Bight have met with ineffectiveopposition from enemy fighters. Daylight raids by Wellingtons on the14th December and the 18th December have met with strong opposition by single-engined and twun-engined fighters (Me. 109&apos;s and Me. 110&apos;s). R.A.F. crewsdescribed the Me. 110 as being a fast and manoeuvrable fighter, and confirm thatit is equipped with cannon armament. Night patrols over the Frisians still meet with no fighter opposition.Coastal.47. Coastal aircraft have continued to be active over the North Sea. Someof tins activity has been in conjunction with mine-laying and the recent attacks on ships. There has been some activity also off the West Coast of Norway, andthe unit believed to have been engaged was the coastal tactical developmentsquadron at Travemunde. A coastal squadron has moved from the heligoland bight to East Prussia.
Mine laying Aircraft employed.48. It has not yet been definitely established whether land planes of theGerman bomber force have been engaged in dropping mines by parachute,although one unconfirmed report states that three Do. 17&apos;s were seen to dropone mine each near the mouth of the Humber. A report from the Royal aircraft establishment, Farnborough, on the bomb-stowage of the He. Ill brought down at Dalkeith states that it is unlikely that He. 111&apos;s could be employed as minecarriers without considerable modification. This applies though not to thesame extent to the Do. 17, but the possibility that mines could be hung fromexternal racks cannot yet be entirely excluded. - -RUSSO-FINNISH HOSTILITIES.Situation at Sea.49.   No encounters between the opposing Naval Forces have been reported.There have apparently been further Russian attempts at bombardment, andthe Finns claim that at the beginning of last week, in an engagement with the shore batteries off Turku (Abo), a new Russian destroyer of the Gordi Class of1,800 tons was so badly damaged that she sank.On the morning of 13th December a single Russian destroyer was attacked by a Finnish bomber, was badly hit and developed a list. The Russian ice-breakerYermak is reported to have been unsuccessfully attacked by Finnish aircraft offTallinn.The evidence with regard to the damage to the Cruiser Kirov is stillconflicting, but there is no doubt that the heavy batteries on Russaaro (off Hango)obtained a hit. She was reliably reported in Libau, which is probably her newwinter base, on the 13th December, and has not since been reported at sea.There is an unconfirmed press report of the 20th December that the battleshipOktiabriskaya Revolutsiya was sunk after an engagement with batteries near thefrontier on the Karelian Isthmus, but it is believed that she was only damaged.If this is so, then the batteries engaged were probably the 10 or 12-inch batteriesat Saarenpaa, on the southernmost point of the island of Bjorko. It seems likely that the battleship was engaged in an attempt to outflank the Finnish batterieson the western side of the Isthmus, many of which had originally been constructedby the Russians themselves. The staff work of the Russian Command at sea isknown to be indifferent, and it is possible that they were unaware of the arcs of fire and accuracy of the Finnish Coast defences, although the Headquarters&apos; staff at Kronstadt should have had the information.In their efforts to enforce the blockade of Finland the Russians appear tohave attacked at least three German merchantmen the Olixa, Volheim andPillau.  The Volheim is reported to have been torpedoed.Situation on Land and in the Air.50. The only important developments since the 14th December have occurred in the extreme north, where the Soviet drive south of Petsamo has made considerable progress and the advance from Kandalaksha towards the head ofthe Gulf of Bothnia at one time appeared extremely threatening. The latest reports, however, indicate that weather conditions have brought the Soviet forcesin the Petsamo area to a halt, while the Finns have staged an effective counter-offensive in the Kuolajarvi sector (west of Kandalaksha).The Russian pressure in this area appears to be designed to overrunNorthern Finland by a concentric advance on the head of the Gulf of Bothnia,a real danger and one that is not minimised by the Finnish General Staff. Butdistances are great and communications, with the one exception of the roadPetsamo-Rovaniemi-Kemi, are poor. Moreover, there are many indications that.the Soviet administrative ma chive, ever a weak link, is feeling the strain; and difficulties are bound to increase as the turn round for traffic becomes greaterand wear and tear on transport begins to make itself felt,.[20522] D
51. Elsewhere there have been no important changes, though somesanguinary fighting has taken place both on the Karelian Isthmus and north of Lake Ladoga. The Finns have found difficulty in coping with a monsterRussian tank which has lately put in an appearance, but in spite of this theSoviet forces appear to have gained little, if any, ground.The general impression is that the Finns are still full of fight and the rank and file confident in their ability to halt the Russian attack. Nevertheless,Finland must be feeling the strain of having to oppose forces so greatly superior.On the Russian side there appears to be no great eagerness for battle and therehave been many rumours of trouble among the troops. Although these stories are certainly exaggerated, they may have some foundation in fact, as there is little doubt that the Red Army is poorly clad and that the arrival of supplies is oftenseriously delayed.52. A recent estimate puts the Soviet forces at six to eight divisions andsome mechanised brigades in the Karelian Isthmus and six divisions betweenLake Ladoga and the Arctic Ocean. While it is probable that communicationson the Finnish eastern frontier will prohibit the use of more than six divisions in active operations, it is quite likely that there are additional forces in reservenear the Murmansk railway.53. Soviet losses up to the 12th December are estimated at 13,000. including3.000 killed and 1,000 missing. Accurate figures of Finnish losses have not yetbeen received.54. Press reports stated that Russian air raids took place over most ofthe chief towns of Finland on the 19th December. Details appear to have been as follows :- Helsinki. Raid lasted fifty minutes. About twenty Russian aircraft were observed. More than thirty bombs were dropped on the edge of thecity. There were no casualties and little damage. The raiders met with heavy fire from anti-aircraft guns. 900-lb. bombs were used. About 50 percent, did not explode.Viipuri. A number of incendiary and high-explosive bombs were dropped. Fires were caused. A Red Cross hospital was damaged. no official list of casualties has been issued. Two Russian aircraft were shot down.Hango. A state of alarm lasted five hours. Bombs were dropped but little damage was done and there were no casualties. The population tookrefuge in extremely good A.R.P. shelters.Tammerfors. Slight damage was caused.Abo. Four air raids took place; the last attack was carried out bynine aircraft. Bombs were dropped on workmen&apos;s quarters and the municipalhospital. Streets were swept by machine-gun fire. Manjr buildings were set on fire.55. The Soviet Air Force has not, as -yet, had any very great influence onthe operations; but the Finnish Government is, undoubtedly, anxious in that respect and on account of the lack of reserve aircraft in Finland.
