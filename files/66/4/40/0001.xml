Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1940.-I/secret copy No.W.P. (40) 10.TO BEKEPT  UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.GERMANY&apos;S SUPPLY OF IRON ORE FROM SWEDEN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a record of a conversation on the8th January between Mr. Charles Hambro, of the Ministry for economic warfare, and the Swedish Minister in London.Foreign Office, January 9, 1940.Memorandum oe Conversation between the Swedish Minister andMr. Charles Hambro, 7-45 p.m. January 8, 1940.M. PRYTZ commenced by asking me whether I was aware of the complica-tions which had arisen in connexion with the deliveries of iron ore to Germanyvia Narvik, and whether I was informed of the decision of the British Govern-ment which had been conveyed to Norway and Sweden during the week end.Did I realise that the action contemplated by the British meant war in scandinavia ?I replied that I could not see why it meant war in Scandinavia. I could not see what the Germans could gain by invading or bombing Norway or Sweden.They would immediately jeopardise their main supply of iron ore and their mainexport market. I thought the maximum that they would do would be to stopDanish food ships. M. Prytz replied that the Norwegians would kick up aninfernal row and were taking a most serious view of the matter. He was worriedabout one point which had arisen in his conversation with the Secretary of State.He felt that there was some feeling that during the secret conversations theSwedish delegates had given us to understand that the Germans could not get toNarvik without going outside the three-mile limit.He had always known this to be wrong and feared we had been misled.H.10817   [20608]
I told him that, as far as my recollection went, there had been long discussions between us on this point, and M. Wallenberg, anyway, was most emphatic that in good weather it could be done.It was always understood that the Swedes could not carry out their side ofthe gentieman&apos;s agreement unless we &quot; looked after &quot; Narvik.I promised him to confirm the above after consulting the others who werepresent at the conversations. He seemed very keen to be assured on this point.He then asked whether we had any ulterior motives in taking this action in norway. He said he had been assured on this point. I stated that I was unaware of high policy, but I was sure he would not be misled. I referred to the talkbetween Mr. Montagu-Pollock and M. Boheman, and said I was very surprised,and so was Mr. Collier, at this grave outburst, having always known thatM. Boheman expected us to &quot;look after&quot; Narvik. I was personally mostsurprised at his attitude, unless it was in order to produce an atmosphere for theGermans.M. Prytz then asked whether there was any other motive than the iron orewhich compelled us to take this very violent action.I replied that there certainly were other reasons. Our ships were being sunkin Norwegian waters. These waters were being used as a high road by all theGerman submarines, warships and returning merchantmen. Hitler had orderedall his mercantile marine to come home, and we wanted to stop it. the norwegians were not even protesting about these matters for fear of the Germans,and we could not allow this to go on. It was seriously interfering with our blockade.He agreed and seemed relieved to hear this. He said that the Norwegianswere funny, difficult people and would never see the wider aspects of these matters.He then asked : &quot;If shipments of ore to any belligerent from Narvik wereprohibited, would you then refrain from action within territorial waters? &quot; I told him I could not answer this question, but I would ask the Foreign Office, sothat they could communicate with him if they thought fit. M. Prytz then turned to me and said : &quot; I agree with you. I don&apos;t believe the Germans will take any drastic action against Norway and Sweden except perhaps invade Denmark, and I doubt even that because, although it could be done by a telephone call, it would cause great dislocation and would spoil the German granary. They might stop the food ships to England, but I doubt even that.&quot; I cannot say this to the Secretary of State officially, but I considerM. BohemaiTs outburst to be a bit of &apos; diplomatic play-acting.5 I am notsurprised at your decision; I would do it! &quot;I said I knew M. Boheman to be a good actor. He said : &quot; You are right.He had to register the greatest possible protest. We shall protest and the norwegians will protest.&quot; He repeated his estimate of the Norwegian character.He said they would kick up a fearful row and try and pass the responsibility on to the Swedes.I said that I was sure England wanted to help Sweden in every way, and ifhe could make any suggestions as to the technique to be adopted towards ourobtaining our desired end, we would be very pleased to consider it.He said that ships coming out of Narvik had to go through a very dangerousnarrow channel near the &quot; Stout &quot;(?) just south of Narvik. Otherwise theyhad a two-hour trip outside territorial waters. This needed good weather andgood pilots. These pilots, all Norwegian, were earning large wages. Why notbuy off the pilots ? If there were no pilots, the German ships would hardly dareto take the inner channel.We could then take them without violating territorial waters. I told himI would note the suggestion.He was very pleased to hear about the wrecks. He said : &quot;Good. Arrangemore of them ! &quot;We then discussed the German position and their obvious shortage of certain articles. He said that he did not see why they were short of iron ore, becausethey could not be using any. I said that lack of iron ore would close works and create unemployment, and the more unemployment, the sooner the break up ofGermany.  He agreed.  He told me that the big Nazi industrialists were arguing
as follows : National Socialism, only thrives because a country becomes too poorto afford democracy. Therefore, if they could keep the war going three years,both sides would be bankrupt and, therefore, whichever side won, a Nazi policy would have to be adopted and each side would start level. Under these conditionsGermany would soon dominate the British Empire and so the world. If the waronly lasted two years, then England would still be rich and would continue tomaintain democracy and smash Nazidom. Therefore, the Germans wanted along war.O. HAMBRO.January 9, 1940.
