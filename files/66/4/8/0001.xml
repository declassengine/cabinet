We consider,therefore, that it should be brought to the notice of theWar Cabinet as a matter of extreme urgency.2. A full analysis of the small arm ammunition situationis an extremely complicated matter for the following reasons:-.303&quot; and 7.92. mm. ammunition in use by thethree Services, the expenditure and production of which naturally varies in eachcaseD      In addition there are 5 sorts of larger calibre ammunition which require thesame type of production.ammunition between the three Services.T he supply of(i) There are no less than 7 different natures of

(li) The rates of expenditure and production must heon a sliding scale,  as&apos; the number of theforces operating and the productive capacity-available is always increasing,(iii)  It is impossible to determine the date whenfull war expenditure will begin.3. In order to reduce the problem to its simplestterms and to give the War Cabinet&apos; a broad picture of theposition we have drawn up this report on the following basis:-(i) Only .303&quot; and 7n92 mm.  ammunition has beenconsidered,(ii) Stocks available and expenditure anticipated inthe United Kingdom and in France only havebeen taken into account.      stocks scatteredabout in other parts of  the world are in anycase not readily available for use elsewhere.Should active operations begin overseas aswell as in France,  the deficiencies disclosed in the later paragraphs of this pape r would beincreasedo( iii) We have lumped together in one total all naturesof small arm ammunition,  and the requirementsboth of the Army and of the Royal Air Force.(iv) We have disregarded the requirements of theNavy, since though the Admiralty already haveapproximately one year&apos;s stocks in hand ashoreand in H.IvL Ships their totals are so small thatthey do not appreciably affect the problem.(v)  The figures given of expenditure and production are only approximate and have been averaged out over a period of several months.-2-

( vi),Ho.,account has been taken of the largeimmediate demands made by Colonies, Allies,etc, ,  amounting to some 192 million roundsin all, nor of subsequent recurring demands which are certain to come in,(vii) We have assumed that the present inactivitywill continue until 1st January, 1940.Short-term position (January to Juno 1940).4. Estimated total stocks&quot; in theUnited Kingdom and France at1st January,  1940,  includingbase and transit reserves,  orthe equivalent in the case ofthe R. A, Fo  0 o o o . .   -* o e . o.........   388 M.Estimated production ( average)from all sources&apos;2&apos; ...............    76 M. per month( rising from 5C -in January to95 in June) .Estimated full war expenditure in France andat home ................ Army 70R. A.F.49Total 119 M.  per month.5. Average full war expenditure would thus exceedaverage production by 43 millions per month during thefirst half of 1940.      Assuming active operations begin onthe 1st January,  our total available reserves would &quot;bereduced to 130 million by the end of June 1940, i.e.  **nlyx Made up as follows:-Stocks on 1st November ... Army. . .216 M.R.A.F,&apos;  104 M,Production less expenditurein November and jjecember,estimated ..............84-16 =    68 M.388Includes bulk consignments now being shippeu-,from India and Canada.-3-

approximately one month&apos;s full war expenditure - and this with no more than 10 divisions in the fields      This amountis approximately equal to the base reserve and transitstock in Prance (or the equivalent in the R,A,Pt) which ismaintained in the field in case of interruption of communications.      The reserve in the ammunition depots athome would &quot;be completely exhausted.6, In July 1940 the rate of production is expected torise to 115 millions per month,  and to increase by some10 to 15 millions per month in each succeeding month.In about August therefore production would be just covering the requirements of the first 10 divisions and the R.A.P.But it would not suffice to keep pace with the increased expenditure of new divisions, if 20 divisions are to beput into the field by the end of the first 12 months ofwar;    thus, no leeway would be made up for a very long time,7. Actual expenditure up to date has only been of theorder of 8 millions per month.      Should, therefore,  thepresent inactivity continue,  the exhaustion of our reserves would be correspondingly postponed.      We cannot, however,count&quot;on the enemy being so accommodating, nor can we besure that production will not be interfered with by enemy action or other causes08. It is thus clear that if active operations beginearly next year we may be faced with the desperate situation of having insufficient small arm ammunition even to keepour forces in the field supplied,  to say nothing of meetingthe other heavy demands noted in paragraph 3 ( vi)  above.ife recommend, therefore,  that emergency measures should betaken without the slightest delay to.bridge the wide gap between production and expenditure which may occur in thenear future.     It should be realized that the defence services can take no executive measures to remedy thesituation.    The whole matter is now in the hands of theMinistry of Supply. .

Long-term position.9. There are so many variable factors to be taken intoaccount in assessing the ultimate rate of expenditure ofsmall arm ammunition when the expansion programmes of theArmy and of the  Royal Air Force have been completed that itis impossible at this stage to give firm figures.      Itseems probable, however,  that the requirements of the two services will be of the following order:-Army (at 55 divisions) 0*03.0 350 millions per monthRoyal Air Force s........... ,  110       &quot; &quot;       &quot;Total    460        &quot; &quot;        &quot;10.        In the last war cur production of small armammunition rose to about 300 million rounds per month, butit must be remembered that with the large increase of automatic weapons  in the modern division and the very high rate of fire of the modern fighter aircraft (47800 roundsin a quarter of a minute)  our requirements in this war arelikely to be considerably greater than in the last.      Itwould be deplorable if, as a result of the expansion of our forces, we found ourselves faced with acute crises over theshortage of small arm ammunition at recurring intervalsthroughout the war.      VVe strongly recommend, therefore,  that production plans should be based on a monthly consumptionof not less than 460 million rounds.Summary.11.        To sum up:-( i) lie are faced with the possibility of an immediateshortage of small arm ammunition during the -first half of 1940, when our average production will be under two thirds of our estimated expenditure Rt full wqr r^tes.

(ii) In consequence, if full war expenditure beginson 1st January, our reserves of small armammunition at home and in Prance would, be practically exhausted by June 1940, even with only 10 divisions in Prance.(iii) We recommend that emergency measures should betaken immediately by the ministry of supply to bridge this gap between production andexpenditure of small arm ammunition.(iv) As a long-term policy we recommend that production should be planned now to meet an ultimate consumption of i+60 million roundsper month.(Signed)    DUDLEY POUNDEDMUND IRONSIDER.
