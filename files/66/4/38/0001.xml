NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.No naval events of outstanding importance have occurred during the week under review, and losses of merchant ships due to enemy action have again been small. The second Canadian Troop Convoy arrived safely in the Clydeon the 30th December.Home Waters.2. During the afternoon of the 28th December, H.M.S. Bar ham was torpedoed by a submarine in a position north-west of the Hebrides. Four menwere killed and one wounded. The ship was able to proceed to Liverpool under her own steam, where she arrived on the 30th and is now undergoing repairs.A hunt for the submarine by escorting destroyers failed to locate her.3. H.M.S. Coventry (A.A. Cruiser) was attacked in Sollum Voe by twodive-bombing aircraft at 10-20 a.m. on the 1st January. No hit was obtained,but one bomb fell near enough to put one of the ship&apos;s dynamos out of actiontemporarily. Fighters of the Fleet Air Arm went up from Hatstone to inter-cept, but it is believed that the enemy aircraft got away.4. The work of laying mines in the British prohibited area off the east coast, published on the 23rd December, is being proceeded with. Maps showingthe declared mined areas are attached to this resume. The Northern entrance tothe channel formed by the newly declared Fast Coast minefield lies just north of Aberdeen, and. since it is probable that this area will be subject to increasedGerman mining, Peterhead is now being used as a base for local anti-submarine and minesweeping forces.Foreign Waters.5. An unknown tanker, similar in appearance to the German tankerAltmark, was sighted in a position approximately 820 miles south-east ofBermuda, steering to the north-eastward at high speed, on the afternoon of the28th December. The Altmark is believed to have on board 300 prisoners captured by the Admiral Graf Spee. French armed merchant cruisers and submarinescontinue to look out for her to the north-eastward of this position.6. The action with the Admiral Graf Spec has brought into prominencethe neutrality zone declared by the American Republics at a distance of 300-600miles round their coasts to act as a cushion against belligerent action.The United States has the only navy in a position to keep a look-out over a wide area, and on the Atlantic seaboard has about 30 warships in additionto 40 destroyers, specially commissioned, and 90 coastguard vessels. It is also reported that 19 squadrons of twelve aircraft each are being employed. In the pacific the air strength has also been increased.In South America the chief navies are those of Argentina. Brazil andChile, each of which has between 5 and 10 warships in use and these haveoccasionally carried out patrols, though it is obvious that the forces availablebear no relation to the large area which has been declared.Protection of Seaborne Trade.7. A total of 343 vessels has been convoyed during the week : 298 British,26 French, and 19 neutral. Only one ship in convoy has been damaged by enemy action the Swedish S.S. Svarton, which struck a mine north of Buchan Ness.The increasing willingness of neutrals to take advantage of British convoys isshown by the presence in a convoy from Norway of no fewer than 19 neutrals,in company with 8 British ships.8. The British Forces employed on escort duty during the week included1 battleship. 1 aircraft carrier, 4 cruisers, 3 armed merchant cruisers, 37destroyers, 12 escort vessels, and 2 submarines. In addition, the French Navyprovided 1 battleship, 2 cruisers, and 4 destroyers for escort work.
9. The total number of ships convoyed up to the 3rd January was 5,911.The total losses of ships in convoy since the beginning of the war is 13 a percentage of 0-22 per cent.Anti-Submarine Operations..10. During the week under review there have been ten attacks on sub-marines, eight by surface craft and two by aircraft. No definite result can be claimed for any of these attacks.German Fleet Intelligence..11. A reliable report states that a ship of the &quot; Deutsehland class was seen approaching Kiel during the forenoon of the 21st December badly damagedforward. It is significant that a pocket battleship had previously been reportedgoing north through the Great Belt at 6 p.m. on the 20th, and returning to the southward early on the 21st. The same source reports that on the 20th Decembera badly damaged cruiser of the &quot; Konigsberg &quot; class, with a large hole forward,was seen in the Kiel Canal. Further information indicates that these reports are probably correct.12. A report has been received that a pocket battleship or cruiser leftWilhelmshaven on the 22nd December for tropical waters.13. Photographic reconnaissance on the 2nd January at Wilfielmshavenindicated that one battle-cruiser, one pocket battleship or cruiser, one cruiser ofthe &quot; koln &quot; or &quot; Leipzig &quot; class, and nine destroyers were in harbour that day.Light craft have been sighted in the German Bight on various dates, and itis reported that patrols have been re-established in the Kattegat, presumably forthe interception of merchant shipping.14. The German Naval Patrol Vessel No. 704 went ashore in a storm on thesouth coast of Sweden on the 30th December.  Her crew were landed.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.15. Losses of merchant ships due to enemy action have again been small,the total tonnage for the week amounting to 12,749 tons.Three British ships (total tonnage 6.260) and four neutrals (total tonnage6,489) have been sunk; of these two were sunk by submarines, and four by mines.Details are shown in Appendix 1.There have been no attacks carried out by aircraft or surface vessels.16. The average rate of sinkings of British, Allied and Neutral shippingper week for seventeen weeks of war to midnight the 30th-31st December is approximately 12- - ships, or 42,000 gross tons per week, as compared with 104ships (206,000 gross tons) per week during the peak period in April 1917. total numbers and tonnage of British, Allied and Neutral mercantile losses from thecommencement of the war to the 3rd January are given in Appendix 2. Therehave been no French losses since the 22nd November. Three charts are attached,which show the above figures in graphic form.Against our losses may be set additions to British mercantile, ocean-goingtonnage clue to new7 construction, seizures, &amp;c. The average weekly incrementfor the seventeen weeks, details of which are given in Appendix^- was about-4 ships, or 24,000 tons, which almost exactly balances our own losses.Vessels under construction are 12 tankers of 83,000 tons, and 130 other vessels of 729,000 tons.German Minelaying.17. There appears to have been a lull in the German attack by mine.German mines continue to be found, mainly oil&apos; the East Coast. Whether theseare newly laid or mines previously laid with delayed release is not clear. the ports of Dundee. Blyth and the River  Lumber were closed for short pei&apos;iods asa result of mining between the 28th and the 31st December.[20584] - B 2
18. On the 1st January, fast surface vessels were reported to bemanoeuvring in the Would, off Cromer, between 5 and 7 p.m., and it appearsprobable that they were laying mines.Numerous explosions (presumably due to premature detonation of mines),have been reported off the East Coast; on the 31st December there were elevensuch explosions.19.   Since the start of the war three distinct forms of mine have been used -(a) Ordinary moored contact mines.(b) Delayed release contact mines.(c) Magnetic mines.There are also indications that some form of acoustic mine may be employed.20. The ordinary moored mine can be cleared by normal sweeping methodsemployed in the last war. but it is of interest to note that the number of thosecleared by sweepers is rather less than the number washed up on our coast.The delayed release mine can also be dealt with by normal sweeping methods and,indeed, it is probable that of the mines dealt with by sweepers some were of thedelayed release type.21. The magnetic mine is the only one which requires special equipment forits destruction, and the provision of this equipment has been given priority.During the past week one of the most promising sweeping devices has been given a practical trial, with satisfactory results, and the lull in the attack has come ata time which is most opportune for the development of counter-measures.Personnel of Navy.22. The following figures of naval and marine personnel include allmobilised officers and ratings on the active, retired and reserve lists.122,936 on the 30th April, 1939160,960 on the 31st August.178,676 on the 30th September.189.943 on the 31st October.198,028 on the 30th November.207,700 on the 31st December.These figures include 1.500 Royal Air Force officers and men on loan to the royal navy.The increase in personnel has been necessitated by the addition of nearly600 vessels to the Fleet, mostly patrol and minesweeping craft, details of whichare given in Appendix 5.Casualties to Personnel.23. The total casualties in the Royal Navy by enemy action from the3rd September to the 31st December are as follows : -24. The total losses of life through enemy action in the mercantile marinefor the same period, so far as they can be determined are given in Appendix 4.These figures do not include the crews of certain ships which are overdue atthe time of going to press.Economic Warfare.25. On the 2nd January there were 47 neutral ships in the three contraband control bases in the United Kingdom, of which 29 had been there for five days or less. The system under which advance copies of manifests of cargoes are received and considered before the ships&apos; arrival at ports in this country resultedin 24 cases being dealt with in the week under review. In 19 of these cases theships concerned were released, subject merely to the formal checking of theoriginal manifests on their arrival at the Control Bases.OfficersRatingsKilled,1252,010Wounded.25225
26. During the week 20.965 tons of cargo were seized. The principal itemswere 17.544 tons of petroleum and allied products. 1.453 tons of ores and metals.606 tons of foodstuffs. 458 tons of oil seeds. 12S tons of rubber and 258 tons ofgums and resins.27. In general, the Scandinavian opposition to British contraband control is becoming less. The Norwegian ships, however, protest at being taken in toKirk wall, and the masters of some ships are supplied by their owners with a formal letter to he handed to the Boarding Officer, refusing to navigate if orderedthere, and turning over the entire responsibility for ship, crew7 and cargo to theBoarding Officer.German Shipping.28. The S.S. Tacoma (8.268 tons) has been interned at Montevideo, andthe S.S. Johann Schulte (5,334 tons) has gone ashore on the Norwegian coast and is reported as a total loss.In addition a number of ships are reported as sequestered or under an embargo for claims, among them being the S.S. Windhuk (16,662 tons) at Santos.All except three German merchant ships in Dutch East India ports have beenattached on account of outstanding bills and vital parts of their machinery havebeen removed.A large proportion of the crews of German ships in Japan have returned toGermany across Russia, and it is reported that the crew of the S.S. Scharnhorst(18.184 tons), potentially a most dangerous raider, is amongst them.The S.S. St. Louis (16.732 tons) has arrived at Hamburg from Murmansk, atwhich port she took refuge at the outbreak of war.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.29. Throughout the period under review, extremely cold weather conditions have prevailed on the Western Front. Only a few local attacks have been attempted by the Germans and patrolling has not been as active as in previousweeks.Work on defences has also been held up by the extreme cold.Work on the south-eastern wing of the Siegfried Line, opposite the Swissfrontier, continues. It is reported that a major work at Grenzach (three miles east of Basle) has already been almost completed.Germany.30. It appears that work on a large scale has commenced on the fortifications-tions on Germany&apos;s new Eastern Frontier. Thousands of workmen and largequantities of material are reported to have been transferred to Poland and thenew fortifications are already known in Germany as the &quot; Ostwail &quot; (East Wall).31. Reports continue to be received regarding the assembly and trainingof an expeditionary force on the north coast of Pomerania and Prussia. It isnot believed that a force of any considerable size has yet been assembled or thatmountain divisions, which would be most suitable for winter operations in scandinavia, have been transferred to this area.Italy.32. The date provisionally fixed with the Italian War Ministry for theexchange of military information in accordance with Annex 2 to the Protocol ofthe Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938 is the 10th January, 1940. The exchangewill take place simultaneously in London and Rome. Prior discussions withthe Italian War Ministry on matters of detail have been proceeding in a cordialatmosphere, and an effort is being made by both parties to clear up misunder-standings that arose over the notification of troop movements during 1939.
33. There has been little movement of troops. The return of one infantry division from Albania to its peace station in Italy has been confirmed. Somediscontent, probably among reservists, has been reported in Albania, where thegarrison is now estimated at less than 60,000. Movements of drafts continuebetween Italy and Libya, where the total estimated garrison of white troopsremains around 130,000.Egypt and Palestine.34. One brigade and a proportion of divisional troops of the 1st CavalryDivision left the United Kingdom between the 22nd and 29th December andare due in Palestine on the 8th January.The Durham Light Infantry, who have been withdrawn from Tientsin, willembark at Hong Kong on the 5th or 6th January for Port Said.Far East.35. Large-scale operations are reported from both north and south China.In Shansi, where Japanese troops have recently been reinforced by units fromManchuria, the fighting has evidently been severe. Operations, on a smaller scale,have also spread into Suiytjan, where the Japanese are trying to clear the areaof guerrillas.Japanese columns are operating north of Canton on road and rail communi-cations. Fighting has occurred forty miles north-east of the city, and one reportci&apos;edits the Japanese with having advanced some seventy miles northward, near the Canton-Hankow railway. Further west, it is now.fairly plain that theChinese sustained a serious reverse in their original, abortive counter-offensive on Nanning. In addition to ground operations, Japanese aircraft have been active over a wide area of south China up to the border of Indo-China.In general, there has been a considerable revival of military activity. TheJapanese are evidently increasing their pressure in the hope of creating a morefavourable opportunity for establishing a federal government for occupiedChina, under the secessionist leader, Wang Ching-wei.AIR SITUATION.German Air Activity.Bomber Force.36. The German bomber force as a whole has continued to be inactiveduring the past week. Isolated operations have occurred as follows : On the27th December a bomber Staff el (equivalent to a squadron) proceeded fromWesterland to a position east of the Farn Islands. The flight was preceded by a reconnaissance of the area, and the objective was almost certainly H.M.S.Triumph.   The Staff el failed to locate its objective and returned.37. On the 1st January eight bombers from No. 30 Kampfgeschwader were engaged in operations over the North Sea, working in pairs. A Hudson fromCoastal Command intercepted one of these pairs in a position 70 miles E.N.E. ofFarn Island. It described the enemy aircraft as Heinkel 111, though it isbelieved that this unit is equipped with the new Junker 88. One of these two aircrafts was shot down and it is known that the other managed to return toWesterland on one engine. Another pair of Heinkels or Junker 88&apos;s appearedover the Shetlands and bombed H.M.S. Coventry. A Gladiator fighter, operating from Sumburgh in the Shetlands, intercepted one of these aircraft. After arunning fight, which continued 80 miles out to sea, the Gladiator was compelledto break off the fight and return.Coastal Operations.38. German coastal units have carried out very few operational flights overthe North Sea this week.
Laud Reconnaissance.39. Land reconnaissance aircraft made numerous flights over french territory on the 29th December and visited the districts south of Saverne andSarreburg Luneville on the 30th. Otherwise enemy reconnaissance units havebeen very quiet, probably owing to the bad weather.Fighters.40. The only intelligence of interest concerning the enemy fighter defence is the move of a Fighter Gruppe westwards from Werl (east of the Ruhr) toWesel (20 miles from the Dutch frontier).Training.41. Training activity was much reduced during the Christmas period, but is now normal. A noteworthy point is the considerable number of training flightsto and from East Prussia by school and other aircraft. Baltic training,previously noted to be intense, has suddenly dropped to below normal, probably on account of bad weather.German Official Attitude to Civil Air Lines.42. The German Legation, Oslo, has warned the Norwegian Ministry forForeign Affairs of the clangers of flying across the North Sea. The GermanGovernment disclaims, beforehand, all responsibility for possible losses throughwarlike measures. A similar warning has been addressed to the swedish government.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.Operations against the German Fleet.43. During the past week bomber squadrons have continued to stand In-awaiting suitable opportunities to carry out attacks against units of the german fleet. In addition, bomber units have made a number of routine reconnaissancesover specified areas of the North Sea. with the object of attacking any enemywarships observed.44. On the 2nd January, during one of these reconnaissances, twelve to fifteen German long-range fighters (M.E. 110) intercepted and attacked a formation of three Wellingtons 100 miles N.W. of Schillig. One of our aircraft was shot down and another has failed to return. One enemy fighter was definitely destroyed and two others were seen to go down and did not return to engage the formation.It is doubtful if the enemy interception at this distance out to sea was otherthan fortuitous, although &quot; flak &quot; ships, which are located in this area, may havebeen instrumental in giving some warning of the presence of our bomberformations.Reconnaissance of Wilhelmshaven.45. On the 2nd January a Blenheim aircraft was despatched to reconnoitreW^ilhelm shaven to locate heavy units of the German Fleet. Weather conditionsfavoured the reconnaissance and a number of photographs were taken. On inter -pretation, these disclosed that the following warships were in WilhelmshavenHarbour on that date : (i) One battle cruiser;(ii) One pocket battleship or cruiser;(iii) One cruiser, Koln or Leipzig class; and(iv) Nine destroyers.Anti-Minelaying   Operations-Offensive   Patrols   against   German   SeaplaneBases.46. Prior to the institution of the offensive patrols over enemy seaplanebases at Borkum, Norderney and Sylt, twenty-one enemy mine-dropping raids,involving thirty-nine aircraft, were identified off our coasts over a period of twenty-one days.
During the three weeks since the commencement of the patrols nine enemy aircraft, which might have been engaged on mine laying, have been reported.These figures are significant and justify the continuance of the patrols.Reconnaissance of German Seaplane Bases.47. As a result of a report from a neutral observer that a balloon barragehad been seen in the vicinity of Borkum, visual and photographic reconnaissanceswere carried out on the 31st December, and again on the 2nd January, to discoverwhether the enemy had established balloon barrages over his seaplane bases to counter our offensive patrols. No balloons were seen, and since this report wasreceived night sorties have been made over Borkum and Sylt without incident.Fighter Command.48. Although there has been an unusual absence of enemy activity duringthe week, it has been necessary to despatch over one hundred fighter patrols.Various special missions, such as escort for Channel leave boats and trawlerprotection patrols, and the necessity for despatching patrols immediately to investigate doubtful plots account for the number involved.Twenty-three plots were recorded during the week, and of these only one has been confirmed as an enemy raid. This was a single aircraft off Calaison the 29th December. It was intercepted by an aircraft of No. 615 Squadron,based in France. After a short combat the enemy appeared to be hit. but was lost in a steep dive into the clouds.Coastal Command.49. There was a slight increase in the number of coastal patrols and searchesdespatched during the week, although snow and fog interfered to some extentwith convoy escort work in the Channel and up the East&apos; Coast. Nothing ofunusual interest was located.50. An ocean-going submarine was attacked 90 miles north-east of MuckleFlugga by a flying boat of No. 240 Squadron, but none of the three bombs droppedsucceeded in hitting the submarine.Suspicious submarine indications were observed by the anti-submarineescort provided for the Channel leave boat on the 31st December. The Ansonon patrol dropped bombs on the swirl and directed a destroyer to the position.Numerous floating mines have been seen from time to time and their positionreported, but attempts to explode them by machine-gun fire were generallyunsuccessful.51. Coastal Command aircraft have encountered enemy aircraft on two occasions this week. The first engagement occurred on the 1st January, .180 miles east of the Farn Islands, when a Hudson sighted the two enemy bombers referredto in paragraph 37 above. The Hudson attacked and succeeded at once inshooting down one of the enemy, which was seen to be on fire and to hit the sea.The second aircraft was engaged, but after a sharp fight it broke away anddisappeared into clouds. During the engagement a second Hudson arrived and attacked one of the bombers, but the latter was seen to break off the fight and turnaway. Signal messages from this aircraft indicate that it was hit and succeeded in reaching a position 16 miles from St. Abbs Head before landing in the sea.Although a motor boat and an aircraft search were despatched to the area, notrace of it has been found.The second encounter took place between a Hudson and a Heinkel 115. thirtymiles north-west of Lodbierg, on the 2nd January. After a short fight the enemyclimbed into clouds and was not seen again.Operations in France.52. A number of patrols were despatched from fighter squadrons based inFrance.   Enemy aircraft were sighted on two occasions only.During the period under review bad weather interfered with reconnaissanceoperations. Various artillery and observation practice flights, however, were carried out over friendly territory when opportunity occurred, but only two flightswere made over Germany. The first of these was on the 2nd January, when aBlenheim flew 20 miles beyond the frontier, and returned safely in spite of intense
anti-aircraft fire. The second was on the 3rd January, when two Blenheims tookoff from France to photograph the Siegfried Line opposite&apos; the southern portionof the Dutch-German frontier. One of the aircraft landed safely in England,having taken about seventy photographs under fair conditions. The other aircraft is missing, but a British aeroplane is reported to have landed in Belgiumafter an engagement with three enemy fighters, and it is probable that this is themissing aircraft.Operations by the French Air Force.53. The French Air Force has been more active this week, and reconnaissancemissions over enemy territory were carried out every day except the 28th and the30th December.French fighters made 188 sorties, but the only combat took place on the2nd January, when a French patrol engaged six enemy fighters, without result,No French reconnaissance flights were made at night during the week.Situation at Sea.54. No intelligence has been received as to naval activities during the past week in the Baltic and Gulf of Bothnia, where ice conditions must now have ahampering effect on any operations. It is reported that several new destroyers and large submarines have been added to the U.S.S.R. Northern Fleet at murmansk.Situation on Land and in the Air.55. The most important news of the week is a major Finnish success atSuomussalmi. Further details of the fighting round Tolvajarvi and Aglajarvi,just before Christmas, show that the Soviet troops suffered an even severer defeatthan was originally believed. There has been heavy fighting on the KarelianIsthmus, where mass Soviet attacks have been beaten off with heavy casualties.The fighting, both there and in the Far North, seems now to be held up byappalling weather conditions.The battles of Tolvajarvi and Suomussalmi (or Kiantajarvi) were bothmajor Finnish successes, each resulting in the virtual destruction of a Sovietinfantry division by very much weaker Finnish forces. Reliable reports of thematerial captured by the Finns illustrate the extent of these victories.The continued failure of the Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus is mor significant than their failures in the difficult country further north. The Karelianfront is within 50 miles of Leningrad, one of the greatest military bases in theSoviet Union, and is quite well served by road and rail communications; whilethe Finnish defences are only of moderate strength, and include no big under-ground works of the Maginot Line type.56. There are numerous reports of increasing discontent in the Army and among the civilian population of Moscow and Leningrad over the losses andprivations of the Finnish campaign. The complete lack of interest in the wardisplayed by the Government-controlled press and broadcasting organs is some indication that the authorities are not well pleased by the course of events.Reliable reports indicate that troops have been transferred to the Finnishfront from  White Russia and the Ukraine,  and  possibly  also  from  the russo--FINNISH HOSTILITIES.Captured        Normal establish-Gaptured at   at Tolvajarvi- merit of Soviet RifleSuomussa!.mi.

North Caucasus, and that the change has been far from popular. A report thatall men are to be called up for the full period of military service is interesting,as, in the past, this privilege has been reserved for the politically reliable andothers have been given their training in different ways. It is, however, difficultto see how the full annual class of about 1,200,000 can be dealt with.57. The Russian Air Force has continued to bomb the railways and mostprincipal towns in Finland. It appears that the Soviet High Command, seeing that the Finnish defences on land are still intact, is now attempting to break downFinnish resistance by means of indiscriminate air raids. Results so far obtainedare reported to have been insignificant.One outstanding feature in connection with Russian air activity has beentheir inability to damage the Finnish railways, which are still reported to be operating effectively.During the week Finnish aircraft have been employed in bombing retreatingRussian troops and attacking large encampments in the vicinity of Lakes Kauk,Perk and Riesk.58. The Swedes have organised one squadron of 12 Gladiators and one squadron of 12 Hawker Harts, equipped with skis, to proceed with the SwedishVolunteer Division which is to operate from the neighbourhood of Uleabokg.These squadrons will use air bases at Kemi (east of Tornea) and Oultj (south ofKemi), with advanced bases on the frozen lakes nearby.The Swedish Air Staff consider the Russian threat towards Uleaborg to be serious unless aircraft can operate very quickly.59. Finnish losses up to date are said to be one coastal reconnaissance,eight fighter and five bomber aircraft. The total Soviet losses so far reportedare thirty-six bomber and one fighter aircraft.Note on Opposing Air Forces.60. On the outbreak of hostilities between the U.S.S.R. and Finland, it isestimated that approximately 1,000 Soviet aircraft were concentrated on theFinnish frontier.   These aircraft were believed to comprise the following : (i) 350 modern bombers.(ii) 250 fighters, with a performance similar to that of the Gladiator.(iii) 100 obsolete heavy bombers, wfiich might be used for the transport ofsupplies or for the landing of troops by parachute.(iv) 300 obsolete army co-operation aircraft,(v) 40 obsolete flying boats.61.   The Finnish air force consists of :  54 army co-operation aircraft.59 fighters (maximum speed 220 m.p.h.).13 coastal reconnaissance.18 bombers (Blenheims).Total: 144 aircraft.62. Reports received on Russian air tactics in Finland may be summarisedas follows :  (i) Bombing raids are being carried out largely by formations of twelve,nine or seven aircraft.(ii) Attacks on troops and reconnaissance are being undertaken by aircrafteither singly or in threes.(iii) Bombers are not being accompanied by fighters.(iv) The number of pilots fit for cloud or night flying is very small.   This isborne out by the fact that pilots seldom enter cloud, even whenattacked, and rarely fly by night.   Furthermore, pilots have standinginstructions to return to their base one hour before darkness sets in.(v) Attacks by fighters are usually made by three aircraft, but in such closeformation that only the leader can use his gun.
