/Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1939.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (39) 180.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. (39) 182.)TO BE KEPT  UNDER  LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.STOPPAGE OF THE EXPORT OF IRON ORE TO GERMANY:BALANCE OF ADVANTAGE BETWEEN THE MAJORAND MINOR PROJECTS.ON the 22nd December* the War Cabinet directed us to give furtherconsideration to all the military implications of a policy which aimed at thecomplete stoppage of the export of Swedish iron ore to Germany. A full examination of the question is contained in Paper No. W.P. (39) 179.t We hadalready reported^ on the question of stopping the Narvik traffic alone by navalmeans.2.   There are thus two distinct projects now before the War Cabinet, viz. : I. A project involving a partial stoppage of this supply by naval actionto cut off German imports via Narvik. This alone would not be decisive.II. A project designed to ensure the complete stoppage of the supply of swedish iron ore to Germany. This, we are advised, might well bringGerman industry to a standstill, and would in any case have a profound effect on the duration of the war.3. Although in effect the major project includes the minor, we desire toemphasise the fact that they are quite distinct. We have made a briefcomparison of the effort required, and of the effects likely to be achieved, by each.I. Partial Stoppage through Narvik by Naval Means.4.   The advantages of this project are : (i) Naval action can be taken immediately.(ii) It can be achieved with small naval forces without the necessity for amilitary expedition.(iii) It can be represented as a justifiable reprisal for the recent Germansinking of British and neutral ships in Norwegian territorial waters.(iv) It is not dependent on Scandinavian goodwill.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.* W.M.

II. Complete Stoppage by Military and other Action in Scandinavia.6.   The merits of this project are : (i) The complete stoppage of Swedish iron ore to Germany would, so we areinformed, have a profound effect on the duration of the war.(ii) If this information is correct, the employment of a small allied force inco-operation with the Swedish army would secure the diversion of a force two or three times as large from the enemy&apos;s main armies. Thusany strength withdrawn from the western front would be more thancounterbalanced.(iii) It affords an opportunity of initiating early in 1940 operations whichmay prove decisive. We see no prospect of an equal chance being-afforded elsewhere.7.   On the other hand (i) Military operations in Scandinavia would only be practicable if the prior assurance of Norwegian and Swedish co-operation was definitelyforthcoming.(ii) An additional strain would be imposed on our shipping, the situation ofwhich is already causing anxiety.(iii) We should be undertaking a new naval commitment at a time when wemay expect to be suffering from the renewed attack upon our sea communications.(iv) The German reaction might take the form of a major air offensive against this country. Our action, therefore, would increase the risk, alreadypresent, of heavy air attack while our defences are still far from complete.(v) We might become involved in open hostilities with Russia a notunqualified disadvantage.Recommendations.8. If it can be definitely established that the complete stoppage of swedish iron ore to Germany would have a decisive effect on the outcome of the war, andif the co-operation of Norway and Sweden to this end can be secured, it is ourconsidered opinion that the major operation holds out great hopes of success, andshould be undertaken.9. Since the major operation cannot be carried out until March, a possible course of action would be to undertake the minor operation now as a preliminary.By doing so, we should prevent the passage of from half to three-quarters of a5.   On the other hand (i) Our action may cause Germany to act in Scandinavia in one or all ofthe following ways :  (a) She may exert such pressure on Norway and Sweden as to drivethem into her camp.(b) She may seize Naval and Air bases in Southern Norway and thusattain considerable strategic advantage.(c) She may immediately sabotage the Narvik-Galivare railway.which is already mined. This would not only deny us swedish iron ore. but would prevent us from executing the majorproject at a later stage.(ii) Even if Germany takes no action in Scandinavia, the scandinavian countries might be so antagonised that their co-operation, without which we can never effect the complete stoppage of the ore, would notbe forthcoming.(iii) As a result of German reaction, we might be precipitated into undertaking major military operations in Scandinavia before we are ready.We cannot be prepared for such operations until March.(iv) The stoppage of the ore from Narvik cannot have a decisive result.

Moreover, if, in the event, we are prevented from undertaking the major operation, we shall have lost no time in interruptingco some extent the Germany supply of ore. We must emphasise, however, that theconsequences of stopping the Narvik trade now must be to prejudice the subsequentexecution of the major operation. For this reason, we do not recommend thiscourse of action.10. It must be clearly understood that the forces for the major operation to stop the supply of ore can only be found at the expense of the british expeditionary Force and Air Defence of Great Britain. Once the operation has begun, it must be pursued with the greatest tenacity of purpose. It must, in fact,be&quot; regarded as the main and decisive objective; and all our efforts should be concentrated on attaining it. All other operations involving detachments of force will have to be considered strictly in the light of their relations to this main objective.11. If the Cabinet accept our recommendation, consultations with theFrench must take place. The War Cabinet are reminded that this question was broached at the last meeting of the Supreme War Council.12. Finally, we emphasise the vital importance of secrecy, particularly inthe initial stages of planning on which we are now engaged.Leakage of information as to our intentions and plans would endanger thesuccess of the whole project, and might cause Germany to take immediate actionto forestall us.(Signed) C.
