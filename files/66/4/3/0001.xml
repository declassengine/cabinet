THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government most SECRET. Copy No.TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ANNEX I.Report of Admiral Drax&apos;s Committee Section I.Sir, Thurso, 24th October, 1939.BE pleased to inform Their Lordships that we have, between the 18th and24th October, 1939. held a full and careful enquiry into the circumstancesattending the loss of the Royal Oak.2. A. full report, covering all our terms of reference, would be very long;also, it would cover two widely different subjects, the actual loss of the ship, andthe entry of the German submarine, involving a report on all the defences of ScapaFlow. For this reason, and for convenience of circulation in the Admiralty, wehave thought it better to make 2 separate reports :  I. Entry of German submarine, remarks on Scapa defences, &amp;c.II.-Sinking of H.M.S. Royal Oak.3.   Attached hereto is Section I, which includes (a) The cause of the loss of the Royal Oak;(b) The entry of the submarine;(c) Remarks on the Scapa defences;with 7 appendices.*We have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Sgd.) G. C. MUIRHEAD GOULD, Captain.(Sgd.) R. H. T. RAIKES, Vice-Admiral.(Sgd.) R. E. E. DRAX, Admiral (President).The Secretary of the Admiralty.Whitehall&apos;, London, S.W. 1. *We find that-1. The Cause of the loss of Royal Oak.We have obtained no evidence that a submarine was seen or heard enteringor leaving the Flow. The reports that propellers were heard from the Gate Vesselat Hoxa on the night of October 11th, and that the boom was disturbed or* Not reproduced.[20313] b
moved, are held to have no significance. The latter was due to bad weather, whilethe propeller noises were probably caused by our own ships passing the gate.2. Contacts were reported by A/S vessels in the Flow after the sinking, anddepth charges were dropped. Subsequently, Minesweepers located an obstructionin one of the positions in which depth charges were dropped and divers were sent down, but have found nothing. There is therefore no rurther evidence that a submarine was detected or located by these vessels.3. The evidence of the survivors, however, definitely suggests that all theexplosions were from a source external to the ship.on the starboard side, and were such as would be caused by torpedoes fired from a submarine in two salvoes. Inaddition, there is evidence from one of the survivors that he and another man.who has not been identified, saw the conning tower of a submarine in the direction and at a distance that might be expected.  We accept this evidence as correct.4. We consider it is possible for a submarine to have entered the Flow byany of the seven entrances, though entrance by Switha Sound and Water Soundis thought for various reasons to be less likely.Conclusion.5. The evidence available points to the attack having been made by a submarine, and there is nothing to suggest that it could have been made by anyother means. We are definitely of opinion, therefore, that H.M.S. Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes fired from a submarine.The Entry of the Submarine.6. Though it is possible that the submarine entered the FTow prior to the night of October 13th/ 14th. this is not considered likely. In the remarks thatfollow, those on the organisation of the Patrol Vessels apply to the conditions onthat night only; all other statements, including those with regard to lookouts,apply generally,7. The means by which a submarine might have entered Scapa Flow on the night of October 13th/14th are :  (i) Passing through the gap at the Flotta end of the Hoxa boom on the surfaceor trimmed down. This gap is 36o wide with a least depth of waterof 15 feet at High Water and considerably more over the greater part.There was no lookout on shore at the gap. One drifter was patrollingthe whole entrance, which is l-J- miles wide. Approaching this gapwould take the submarine within 5 cables of the battery on StangerHead.(ii) Passing submerged through a gate in the Hoxa boom while it was openedto allow vessels to pass. No Hydrophone or Asdic watch is main-tained at or inside the entrance when the gate is open. Entry herewould be a difficult operation but is possible.(iii) By passing under the Hoxa boom.   The foot of the net at this boomis 25 feet above the sea bottom at Low Water and approximately35 feet above the bottom at High Water Springs. In these cireum-stances we think it would be quite possible for a small submarineproceeding very close to or scraping the bottom to get throughwithout much disturbing the boom.(iv) Passing through the gap at the Flotta end of Switha boom on the surface. There was no lookout on shore at this gap and no PatrolVessel at the boom,(v) Passing through the gap at the Hoy end of Hoy boom on the surfaceor trimmed clown. This gap is 500 feet wide with a depth of waterof 30 feet. There was no lookout stationed on shore at this gap. OneDrifter was patrolling this boom, which, with the gap, is 1-7 mileslong.(vi) Passing through tho opening in Kirk Sound south of S.S. Thameson the surface; this opening is 400 feet wide with a depth of 4 to4-i- fathoms at Low Water. There is another opening about 200 feetwide with a depth of 15 feet or more at High Water.Note. An additional blockship has been placed in this entrancesince 14th October.
(yii) Passing through the opening in Skerry Sound on the surface. Thisopening is 240 feet wide with a depth of 15 feet or more at HighWater.(viii) Passing through the opening in East Weddell Sound on the surface.This opening is 460 feet wide with a depth of 15 feet or more at HighWater. The depth in the centre is 3 to 4 fathoms at Low Water,(ix) Passing through the openings in Water Sound on the surface. One ofthese openings is 400 feet wide and the other 200 feet wide; both havea depth of 15 feet or more at High Water.No lookout is kept at any of the entrances on the East side of the Flowmentioned in (vi), (vii), (viii) and (ix) above.8. The weather on the night of October 13th/14th was fine and clear andthe sea calm. The night was fairly light and for periods the sky was lit upIn- the Aurora and Northern Lights.High Water at Kirk Sound was at 2338 on 13th October; High Water atHoxa was at the same time.9. Any opinion as to which entrance the submarine came in at must beconjecture only, but in many respects Kirk Sound would present the leastdifficulty. Having found a way in, the submarine would no doubt aim to returnby the same route; but if it entered by Kirk Sound at slack water, and left assoon as the torpedoes were fired, the tide would then have been running against it. perhaps as much as 8 knots. Various statements in the Press attributed to Lieutenant-Commander Prienare considered worth studying as circumstantial evidence. They are analysedin Appendix 5.JThe Scapa Defences.10. We consider that the whole problem of the defences of Scapa requiresreconsideration, and that the following should be done at once :  (i)-Provide a sufficient number of Patrol Craft to patrol all booms, andthose gaps through which it is considered in any way possible thata small submarine could enter either on the surface or submerged.A certain proportion of these vessels should be fitted with Asdics,(ii) Provide Asdics : either a fixed asdic or an asdic in the boom-gate vesselor in a specially allocated Pati&apos;ol Craft, to cover the passage throughthe boom gates when open.(iii) Close, if possible, all gaps in the four partially blocked entrances onthe East side of the Flow.(iv) Establish look-outs, guns and searchlights on shore at all partiallyblocked entrances which cannot be blocked completely.   -(v) Close the gaps in the entrances protected by booms.   If any gaps are considered essential for the passage of small craft, look-outs, gunsand searchlights should be established on shore to cover them,(vi) Extend the nets at all booms so that the foot of the net is at theminimum distance above the sea bottom that will prevent damage dueto fouling the bottom, say two or three feet at Low Water,(vii) Provide loops and controlled minefields at the Hoxa  and Swithaentrances.Action has already been taken by the Admiral Commanding, Orkneys andShetlands, to carry out some of these proposals.11. We consider that the following additional measures for improving the defences should be investigated at once, and action taken as early as possiblein accordance with the conclusions reached :  (i) The provision of deep minefields in the vicinity  of the variousapproaches(ii) The placing of contact mines to cover the gaps in any entrances which itis not possible to close by other means,(iii) The moving of Hoxa Boom to the inner position proposed by the admiral commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, and Mr. Mackenzie, in their evidence.[20313] b 2
(iv) The fitting of a second line of A/S nets at the three booms,(v) Whether the boom and net now at Hoxa are of the type best suited to stand the conditions of winter weather in that locality.12. We consider that in order to review thoroughly the existing scheme 01defence on these lines, a staff of officers should be sent to Scapa to work under thedirection of the Admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands. They should include experts in Mining, Booms and Net Defences, and gun defence againstvarious forms of attack.General Remarks.13. It is important that the gates in booms should not be kept open longer than is necessary. The evidence shows that this has been done on some occasions.Special vigilance is required at night and at high water.It is difficult to block entrances effectively against submarines by booms orblockships alone. These methods must be supplemented by others according to circumstances, ext., loops, controlled and other minefields, indicator nets, patrol craft, lookouts, guns and searchlights. It is suggested that in relatively narrowgaps, specially secured mines smaller than those usually employed might be used,or charges secured on wires or nets. Also, instead of searchlights, large typeAldis lamps might be sufficient.In view of the vast expenditure on outstanding work at Scapa, it is essentialthat the defences of Scapa should not be stinted.14. The general feeling at Scapa was that the Eastern entrances to the Flowwere considered by the Admiralty to be satisfactorily closed. Local opinion wasno doubt influenced by Admiralty message 1546/26th May, which gives thatimpression :  Admiralty message: &quot; H.M.S. Scotts survey now received indicates no,repetition no, risk at present exists of submerged entry of submarinesby the Holm or Water Sounds, and that entry on the surface would be extremely hazardous.(2) Their Lordships doubt if further blocking measures would be final or could be relied upon to provide one hundred per cent, security againsta determined attempt at entry of enemy craft on the surface, thoughsuch an attempt is considered extremely unlikely.(3) It has, therefore, been decided further expenditure on blockships cannotbe justified.(4) C.O.C.O.S. is requested to inform Metal Industries of this decision,expressing their Lordships&apos; appreciation oi their valuable assistancein investigating the question.(5) C.-in-C, Home Fleet, is requested to report in view of this decision whether he considers it will be necessary to provide for security byprovision of any patrol vessels.&quot;The view that the base was secure against submarine attack was not acceptedby the Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, who was responsible, and requestswere made for additional blockships and Patrol Vessels. The former were dealtwith in Admiralty Postagram 1100 of 10th July, 1939, which approved 3 extrablockships. The first of these was placed on 8th September. This was the back-ground that the officers who came up at the end of August had to work from, andthis has to be taken into consideration when reviewing the condition of the defences on the night of October 13th-14th. That they were not entirely efficientwas known, but the extent to which they were vulnerable was certainly not generally appreciated.In the past, various officers have been responsible for various sections of thedefence, but it appears that no one officer, has been responsible for the whole of it.&apos; The Admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, has not got sufficient patrol vessels. There are about 40 Drifters under his orders manned by civilians, but- when asked to assist with the patrols the crews were not willing to do so. had they volunteered, or had there been means to compel them to assist, the situation as regards Patrol Craft would have been very different.
15. It seems very possible that the general misconception about the securityof the four Eastern passages may have been enhanced by the fact that the- Scott &quot; report of the 19th May, and to some extent the McKenzie report of the20th May, quote all depths as at Low Water Ordinary Springs. In the &quot; Scott &quot;report the only clear reference to this fact is in the first line : &apos;&apos; Depths quoted in this report are those reduced to chart datum.&quot;&apos;A reader who forgot this would be easily misled by such statements as- A channel with depths of 11 to 12 feet and 325 feet wide exists round the bowsof the Naja. These depths would be 20 and 21 feet at high water springs (as onnight of the 13th-14th October). Further on we read &quot;The remains of twoblockships with 9 and 11 feet over them would have to be avoided.&quot; This state-ment is incorrect, the spring rise being 9 feet. A small submarine drawing12 to 15 feet on the surface could pass straight over these at high water in calmweather. It is possible that some officers who studied this problem were thinking of keeping out. a submerged submarine, while others lacked expert knowledge oftiie probable draft of small German submarines, or the. possibility of theirscraping along the bottom of a channel. Vice-Admiral Max Horton told us that on one occasion when passing German obstructions in the last war he bumpedalong the bottom for three miles. On the other hand, the McKenzie report, datedilie 20th May, contains two very striking paragraphs about the four easternentrances :  &quot; At the present time a good sized tramp steamer could enter Skerr\Sound without serious difficulty, on a course W. true, and a similar vesselcould, with careful navigation, pass to the south of the blockships inKirk Sound.Water Sound and East Weddell Sound could be entered with a vesselsuch as a 500 tons or 600 tons coaster, at high water. Our tug Imperious,draught 12 feet 6 inches passed in and out Water Sound recently, round thebows of the Naja at low water.&apos;&quot;Between the date of this report and the 13th October only one bloekship was placed, viz., the Cap Ortegal, in Skerry Sound.16. The Admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, had to take over a defence scheme that was inadequate and unsatisfactory in many ways. It had,however, been given much thought, it had Admiralty sanction, and was known tobe limited to some extent by the unavoidable absence of certain necessary itemssuch as loops and asdics.The Admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, had been theie only afew weeks, his Chief Staff Officer arrived on the 13th October, he and his staff were constantly harassed by current administrative work, and he had no A/Sofficer, on his staff. Practically all his staff are retired officers, some of whom havebeen retired for a number of&apos; years. The Chief Staff Officer had the additionalduty of Maintenance Captain, which would certainly occupy the whole ofhis time.(Signed) G. C. MUIEHEAD-GOULD, Captain,R. H. T. RAIKES, Vice-Admiral.R. E. E.

MOST SECRET.ANNEX II.Letter from Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, to Admiral Drax.Sir. 25th October, 1939.BE pleased to inform Their Lordships that the attached letter from theCommander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, reached me this evening, shortly after theBoard of Enquiry had concluded and signed their report. We do not consider thatits earlier arrival would have altered our report in any material respect, but it contains a large amount of relevant information, and I therefore suggest that itshould be attached to and circulated with Part I of our report.I have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servant.(Signed) R. E. E. DRAX, Admiral.The Secretary of the Admiralty.Whitehall, London, S.W. 1.&quot;(Most Secret.)No. H.F. 0490/429.The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, H.M.S. Nelson, to Admiral theHonourable Sir Reginald A. R. Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, K.C.B., D.S.O.,c/o The Admiral Commanding. Orkneys and Shetlands. (Received24:th October, 1939.)ISth October, 1939.AS I shall be unable to attend the Board of Inquiry, which is investigating the loss of H.M.S. Royal Oak, I am sending you the following statement for theinformation of the Board :  2. First. I wish it to be quite clear that I accept full responsibility forthe presence of H.M.S. Royal Oak at Scapa and for the number of patrol craftleft at Scapa from those available for guarding the entrances to the three bases at Scapa, Loch Ewe and Sullom Voe.The remainder of this statement is a summary of facts and a precis of correspondence showing the steps taken since October, 1938, as regards patrollingthe booms and blocking the Eastern entrances to the Flow. This may be of use to you as the correspondence took place between myself, the Rear-Admiral.Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, and the Admiralty, and the admiral commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, was neither responsible nor has he acomplete copy of the correspondence.3. On the outbreak of war the only craft available for patrolling the boomswere the fleet drifters, the number of which present at Scapa on 2nd september was 9, two having been detached on 30th August to guard the indicator netsat Sullom Voe. On 11th September another drifter had to be sent to Sullom Voebecause one of the original two had been lost by shipwreck and the number at scapa on that date, with reinforcements from the south, was 11.4. In consequence of Admiralty messages 1532 of 5th September and 1113of 7th September, a subsidiary fleet base was established at Loch Ewe. TheGuardian laid indicator nets in the entrance to the loch and on 11th September
fi fleet drifters were sent from scapa to patrol them. Since then, the disposition of fleet drifters-Loch Ewe 6, Scapa 5, Sullom Voe 2-has been maintainedexcept for the movement of some to Scapa and back, to conform to the movements of capital ships between the two bases, and this was the disposition of the fleetdrifters, for which I take full responsibility as I said before, on 14th October,when the Royal Oak was sunk.Replacement of drifters.5. The condition and efficiency of the fleet drifters had been under considera-tion for some time and in a semi-official letter to the late First Sea Lord, datedo.7th October. 1938, after the experience of the emergency that autumn, I mentioned that the drifters had been found indispensable, that they were wearingout, and suggested that they should be replaced as they passed out of service by Admiralty trawlers of the Basset class, fitted either with A/S or forminesweeping. They would work with their parent ships in peace and on anemergency arising would be used to patrol the nets at the northern bases.This part of my letter was acknowledged by Admiralty letter M. 06976/38of 27th April, 1939, which, while stating that my proposal had been carefully considered, gave an answer that was not altogether helpful.Additional patrol craft.6. On 10th September, 1939, the Admiral Commanding, Orkneys andShetlands, telegraphed to the Admiralty saying that 15 fast craft were requiredfor patrolling booms and indicator nets in his command as drifters are tooslow.The provision of these craft was approved by Admiralty letter M. 09109/39of 20th September, which stated that steps were being taken to requisition andarm them with depth charge chutes.None had reached Scapa by 14th October.Scapa provisional defence scheme.7. A copy of my orders for the defence of Scapa is enclosed (Enclosure No. 1).These were based on the experience of the emergency in September /October, 1938.By September. 1939, it was unnecessary, owing to permanent defence measures taken in the interim, to put much of this scheme into force; but the patrollingof the Hoxa, Switha and Hoy booms by drifters was still applicable and theorders for these patrols in force on. 14th October, 1939. are in O.S.G.M. No. 1(1.10.39), which had received my concurrence (Enclosure No. 2).Blocking of Eastern entrances to Scapa.8. In September, 1938, I approved of the local purchase of a concretebarge at Stromness with the object of sinking it in Kirk Sound (Admiraltyapproval given in Admiralty letter M/P. F). 06480/37 of 22nd October, 1938).Before this was done, however, the emergency came to an end.9. On 3rd November, 1938, the Rear-Admiral and Commanding Officer,Coast of Scotland, telegraphed to the Admiralty (1215/3) that in the opinionof Mr. Mackenzie of Metal Industries, Ltd., the concrete barge would not blockKirk sound completely and suggested a survey. The Admiralty did not consider this necessary in view of the data already available (Admiralty letter M. 06778/38of 18th November, 1938).As a result of further representations by the Rear-Admiral and. commanding officer, Coast of Scotland, however (letter 818/00550 of 1st December, 1938),die Admiralty approved (Admiralty message 1229 of 18th December, 1938) :-(a) Metal Industries to be invited to tender for a shell of 300-350 feet in length to be sunk in Kirk Sound.(6) Existing concrete barge to be sunk in Water Sound to block the narrownavigable channel which was cleared after the Great War.The concrete barge was sunk in Water Sound on 28th February, 1939, leaving a gap of 35 feet between it and the wreck Clio and a passage of 140 yards ofclear water with a rough average depth of 2 fathoms L.AV.O.S. between the bargeand. the charted 1-fathom line. This channel would be extremely difficult tonavigate with any vessel of average turning powers.
10. On loth March. 1939. the S.S. Soriano was sank in Kirk Sound andthe Rear-Admiral and Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, stated in hissubmission to the Admiralty (No. 327/01301 of 24th March, 1939) that he considered that the Soriano and Thames together with the broken up blockshipalready there constituted an effective barrier to passage through the main KirkSound channel; but he added &quot;The four eastern entrances to Scapa Flow,through Kirk, Skerry, East Weddel and Water Sounds, are now for the mostpart effectively blocked, but from the attached reports it is now disclosed for thefirst time that navigable channels still exist through Kirk Sound (between thebroken up blockship south of Thames and Lamb Holm) and through SkerrySound.&quot;   He therefore concurred in the desirability for a comprehensive survey.This survey was approved by Admiralty letter M.02654/39 of 20th April.1939, and carried out by HALS. Scott in May 1939.This Admiralty letter also approved a proposal to rig chain cable or wiresbetween the sterns of the Sort d Thames in Kirk Sound.11. In his submission No. 417/01301 of 21st April, 1939, the Rear-Admiraland Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, in dealing with the question of theremoval by Metal Industries, Ltd., of their plant from Lyness on notice.to quit,recommended to the Admiralty that before this firm left they should be asked toestimate an overall token figure for the work entailed in completing effectiveblocking of the eastern sounds after consulting the Commanding Officer.HALS. Scott, as to the result of the forthcoming survey and be allowed to completethis work.The items foreshadowed were :  Kirk Sound a 250-foot hull to block the gap between the broken upblockship and Lamb Holm (to be laid to the south-westward of the existingchain of obstructions).Wires, cables and other suitable obstructions between Thames andSoriano.Anchors and cables and other obstructions laid out ahead of Soriano.Water Sound a 150-foot trawler hull to block the channel remainingnorth of the concrete barge.Skerry Sound a 100-foot trawler or drifter hull to block the passagenavigable to drifters.In this proposal I concurred., in my message 1527 of 27th April to theAdmiralty.On 8th May the Admiralty approved of obtaining the estimates.12. On 17th May (No. 564/01301 of 17th May, 1939), the Rear-Admiral andCommanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, in submitting the estimate and alternative proposals, pointed out that the navigable channels are much larger than was suspected and, as the velocity of the tidal streams prohibits the use of booms, theonly feasible and efficient method of blocking the channels is by sinking largeships. Fie also asked (on 19th May) for an early decision as Metal industries would be unable to undertake this work in July and August owing to the raising of the Derfflinger.The Rear-Admiral and Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, again asked the Admiralty on 20th May for an early decision because Metal Industries hadan option on a vessel (The City of Ghent), and the value of second-hand vessels wasrising rapidly. A further hastening telegram was sent on 23rd May, in whichI concurred (my message 0934 of 24th May to Admiralty).13. On 26th May a message was received from the Admiralty to the effectthat a study of HALS. Scott&apos;s survey indicates that &quot; no risk at present existsof submerged entry of submarines by Holm or Water Sound, and that entry onthe surface would be extremely hazardous.Their Lordships doubt if further blocking measures proposed would be finalor could be relied upon to provide 100 per cent, security against a determinedattempt at entry of enemy craft on the surface, though such an attempt isconsidered extremely unlikely.It has therefore been decided that further expenditure on blocking cannotbe justified.The Rear-Admiral and Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, is requestedto inform Metal Industries of this decision, expressing their Lordships&apos;appreciation of their valuable assistance in investigating the question.
The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, is requested to report, in view of thisdecision, whether he considers it will be&apos; necessary to provide security byprovision of any patrol vessels.  T.O.O. 1546/26th May, 1939.&quot;To this message I replied (1852/31st May) that the provision of 3 patrol vessels was recommended (for the Eastern Sounds), and asked for a large-scalecopy of the Scott&apos;$ survey as I had not seen it.  This was received on 19th June.14. On 1st June the Rear-Admiral and Commanding Officer, Coast ofScotland, wrote to the Admiralty (No. 618/01301 of 1st June, 1939), pointing outthat, when the Scapa boom defences were originally planned, the base wasconsidered as a Naval anchorage and, although by Admiralty letter M. 00697/39of-January, 1939, Scapa had become the Main Fleet base, it was still only protected by an A/S A. 2 boom single line of A/S nets. For a similar reason he submitted that the position regarding Skerry Sound might be reconsidered in view of theScott&apos;s survey, in which a statement was made &quot; In a channel nearly 300 feetwide a depth of 24-25 feet could be maintained on a steady course from East to west into Scapa Flow.&quot;15. In the middle of June, 1939, Admiral Sir Wilfred French (admiral commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands designate) visited Scapa, and as a resultof his letter to me, written after the visit, and an examination of the Scott&apos;ssurvey, I wrote the enclosed submission (No. 1151/H.F. 01200S of 28th June,1939) to the Admiralty.   (Enclosure No. 3.)16. On 4th July, 1939, the Rear-Admiral and Commanding Officer, coast of Scotland, telegraphed to the Admiralty (1520/4th July, 1939), asking for permission to communicate with Metal Industries with a view to expediting theoperation of further blocking of Kirk and Skerry Sounds.This was followed on 10th July by Admiralty message (1100), a copy ofwhich is enclosed (Enclosure No. 4), stating that the Admiralty had modifiedtheir views and that 3 further blockships should be sunk to block (respectively)the channels between Soriano and Thames, and south of Thames in Kirk Sound,and the main channel in Skerry Sound.17. For the next six weeks further correspondence followed on the selection of blockships and negotiations for their purchase, but on 8th September the cape Ortigal was successfully sunk in Skerry Sound, and on 12th september the Admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, directed Metal industries to block Kirk Sound between the Soriano and Thames with wires and cablesinstead of using the crane lighter belonging to Metal Industries, which hadbeen considered for the purpose.On 15th September the Admiralty telegraphed that on the day before theDirector of Sea Transport had requisitioned the Lake Neuchatel. She sailed from Cardiff on 22nd September for Rosyth to be prepared and left Rosyth forScapa on 14th October and arrived on 15th October with a view to scuttlingon 20th October.The Royal Oak was sunk early on 14th October.(Signed) L.

MOST SECRET.ANNEX IIIReport of Admiral Drax&apos;s Committee Section II.Sir, Thurso, 24th October, 1939.Be pleased to inform Their Lordships that we have, between the 18th and24th October. 1939, held a full and careful enquiry into the circumstancesattending the loss of the Royal Oak.2. A full report, covering all our terms of reference, would be very long;also, it would cover two widely different subjects, the actual loss of the ship, andthe entry of the German submarine, involving a report on all the defences ofScapa Flow. For this reason, and for convenience of circulation in the Admiralty,we have thought it better to make 2 separate reports :  I. Entry of German submarine, remarks on Scapa defences, ofec.II-Sinking of H.M.S. Royal Oak.3.   Attached hereto is Section II with 7* appendices.We have the honour to be.Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Sgd.) G. C. MUIRHEAD GOULD, Captain.(Sgd.) R. H. T. RAIKES, Vice-Admiral.(Sgd.) R. E. E. DRAX, Admiral (President).The Secretary of the Admiralty,Whitehall, London, S.W. 1.Narrative of events in &quot; Royal Oak.&quot;At 0104 on 14th October, 1939, H.M.S. Royal Oak was lying at single anchorin Scapa Bay when an explosion occurred right forward the starboard side belowwater. Its effect was to break all the slips on both cables which allowed the portcable to run out to a clinch and let go the starboard anchor. The explosion itself and the effect of the cable running out woke most of the Officers and some of theShip&apos;s company. The Admiral. Captain, Commander, Engineer Commander andothers hurried on deck after putting on a few clothes. Many Officers who wereaft thought that the explosion was in or under the after part of the ship, this being accounted for by the vibration effect from the other end of the ship.Witnesses in the A.D.P. and on the Flag Deck state that a column of waterwas shot up the starboard side forward and drenched the fore part of the fore-castle. Through the hole in the side a number of shores and other timber mayhave dropped or been blown out.The Captain, on turning out, went on to the Q.D. and being informed thatthe slips on the cable had parted went forward to the forecastle. It was a fineclear night, the sea was calm, and the sky was lit up by the Northern Lights. Hearrived on the forecastle, locked at the cables, received reports from variousOfficers, and sent the First Lieutenant down to inspect the forward compartments.* Not reproduced.
][e remained on the Forecastle a few moments in&apos;order to ascertain whether theship was in any wav affected by what he thought was an internal explosion inthe Inflammable Store. As the ship was neither listing nor settling down^ bythe bows he went down the after forecastle hatch and forward to the cable lockerfiat, Here he met several Officers, including the Engineer Commander, and received reports that the Inflammable Store was venting through the breatherpipe showing that water was entering that compartment and that there was notire. The compartment immediately abaft it, the CO. 2 room, was intact. Upto this time no one had thought that the ship might have been torpedoed, theocneral impression being that there had been an internal explosion, or possibly a bombing attack by aircraft, Under the Captain&apos;s direction orders were givenfor starting salvage pumps and preparing to open and examine damaged compart-ments.  No orders were given for closing watertight doors or deadlights.In the meantime the S.O.O. turned out and went to the AdmiraVs cabinat 0106. The Admiral had already turned out. S.O.O. made a quick examinationof the after part of the ship and returned to report &quot; No damage aft.&quot; Thiswas confirmed a few moments later by the Engineer Commander who had also made an inspection of the after compartments. S.O.O. accompanied the Admiralon deck, but the latter then went forward and S.O.O. went on to the Marines&apos;Messdeck.   He did not see the Admiral again.The Ship&apos;s company generally were not much disturbed by the first explosion,and there are several records of men having turned out and then turned inagain between the first and second explosions. During this interval the launchand picket boat were called away, the Drifter Daisy II was ordered to raisesteam, and two prisoners were released from the cells.At 0116 the Captain was still near the CO. 2 room with several Officers.In his own words &quot; I had no thought other than that a local explosion hadtaken place in the Inflammable Store. This was backed up by the report I received that the CO. 2 room was intact. I had not even thought of the shipbeing torpedoed. I felt no uneasiness about the safety of the ship.&quot; Suddenlythere was another &quot; shattering &quot; explosion, followed at very short intervals bya third and fourth. These explosions occurred on the starboard side of theship approximately between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;X&quot; turrets, and had an immediate and catastrophic effect. The ship at once started to heel to starboard and, with only a slight &quot; hang&quot; for perhaps three or four minutes, heeled over with increasing velocity until she capsized at about 0129.From the moment at which the second explosion occurred it was practically impossible to do anything effective to save the ship, nor was it possible to broadcast the order to &quot; Abandon Ship &quot; as the lights went out and power failed.Officers in various parts of the ship told the men near them to save themselves.The Captain was still in the cable locker flat. He told Officers and men to clearout of the flat and walked aft to the Messdeck which was in darkness. Hesent the men up to the forecastle and followed them up. On the forecastle he realised that the ship was going over as she was heeling so quickly and felt sure that the only thing left to do was to throw over the side the Carleyfloats, &amp;c, and as much wood as possible. The Captain and Commander got towork on this assisted by a few men, but the ship turned over so rapidly that little could be done. In a few minutes they found the deck becoming impossibleto stand on so climbed over the port guard&quot; rails and up the port side until theyslipped or were flung into the sea.The ship capsized and finally sank at 0129, twenty-five minutes after thefirst explosion and thirteen minutes after the second explosion. An Officer whohad climbed up the port side, over the bilge keel and on to the bottom checkedthe time at 0133 before taking to the water.The second, third and fourth explosions were observed by men stationed in the A.D.P. These explosions were accompanied by columns of water which fell on the A.D.P., also a flash which was seen round the funnel casing anda quantity of black smoke which covered the after part of the ship for a short period.After the first explosion the Assistant Torpedo Officer went to the MainSwitchboard, then on to the Messdeck, where he reported to the Eno-ineerOommander and met the Warrant Electrician.   The Assistant Torpedo officer and Warrant Electrician again went down to the Switchboard and thence to[20313] c 2
Nos. 4 and 3 Dynamo rooms, where everything was normal. While still in No. 3Dynamo room the second, third and fourth explosions occurred. The secondseemed to be well forward, the third abreast the Boiler Rooms, and the fourthclose to No. 3 Dynamo Room, but forward of it, probably at the starboard wingEngine Room. After the second and third explosions orange-coloured flamesappeared at the top of the dynamo room hatch. After the fourth explosion the forward bulkhead of the dynamo room, between the dynamo room and the wingengine room, began to bulge inwards and steam began to escape. The two Officersand the Watchkeeper made their way up the ladder. The lights then failed andthe flames became less intense. By the time they reached the Marines&apos; Messdeckthe ship had listed about 25 degrees to starboard. The Messdeck was full ofchoking fumes and burning hammocks and other material.From other reports it appears that, after the third and fourth explosions, theMarines&apos; Messdeck was swept by flames and full of smoke and fumes. Severalhammocks caught fire and were extinguished by men near them. There is alsoevidence that holes appeared in the decks and that the decks caved in.A sliding horizontal hatch abaft &quot; A &quot; turret slid across and jammed in theclosed position due to the heel of the ship and to the fact that the wire strop usedto hold it open had not been properly secured. Men in this compartment may nothave had time to escape by another route. Sliding hatches in other positions mayhave closed similarly.During this period there are several reports of men being blown throughdoors, up hatches, and out of scuttles. By the time the ship capsized a largenumber of men had reached the water via the Forecastle and Quarter Deck. Itappears that few men were saved from the Engine and Boiler Rooms.The Admiral had been on the Boat Deck, where the Engineer Commander,on his way aft, reported to him. Later the Admiral was seen on the Q.D. by the captain&apos;s Maltese Steward, who had come up from below and collected a lifebuoyfrom the starboard guard rails. This steward saw the Admiral amidships callingto the men on the Port side to jump overboard further forward because they were likely to injure themselves by jumping on to the propellers. The steward climbedup towards the Admiral and asked him to come overboard with him as he had alifebuoy, but the Admiral refused, saying: &quot; Don&apos;t worry about me; try to saveyourself.&apos;&quot; He remained there helping the men to save themselves and was not seen again.--Men who tried to man the launch at the starboard lower boom had a terrifyingexperience. They could not cast off from the boom and saw the ship turning overon top of them. Metal from the foretop fell into the launch and sank her, andthe funnel came down into the water between the launch and the ship&apos;s side. one man from the sunken launch was partially sucked into the funnel and then blownout again. Others saw &quot;A&quot; and &quot; B &quot; turrets swing round and &quot; fall into thesea.&quot;After the ship capsized she rolled over to about 160 degrees, possibly righteda little, and is now lying bottom up at an angle of 40 degrees from the verticlewith a trim of 2 degrees aft.Rescue work was first carried out by the &quot;Drifter Daisy II, who had beenlying alongside the port side. Other men were kept afloat by the picket boat,gig, one or two Carley floats or bits of Carley float, pieces of wood, church dealsand empty petrol drums, but the picket boat capsized twice through being over-loaded, and the gig, having her cover on, turned over and over when men tried to climb into her. Very soon boats from Pegasus joined in the rescue work andalso drifters from Scapa Pier. Later drifters came across from Lyness andGutter Sound.The general behaviour of the Ship&apos;s Company was calm and good. Therewere individual cases deserving of special commendation :  Mr. Hughes-Rowlands, Warrant Telegraphist, stood at the bottom of theOfficers&apos; ladder to the Q.D. lighting matches to help men to reach the deck.Corporal Jordan, R.M., supported a hatch on his shoulders to allow othermen to pass up.R.P.O. J. H. Smith, on his own initiative, went to the cell flat after the firstexplosion and released two prisoners.An unknown rating, who had been rescued by the Daisy II, jumped over-board three timeswith a rope&apos;s end to save other men. (It is believed that thisman is known to Lieutenant H: Duncan, Royal Navy, late of H.M.S. Royal Oak.)
Conclusions and Recommendations of the Board.Form of A attack.We think it probable that the attack was made by a Submarine which got inat one of the seven entrances and worked its way along the East shore of the Flowbetween Skerry Sound and Scapa Bay, until the Commanding Officer sightedtwo ships ahead which, from-air reconnaissance, he probably considered to beRoyal Oak nearest and Repulse beyond. We think it likely that he fired a salvoat &quot;the further ship, actually Pegasus, and that one of these torpedoes struckRoyal Oak in the bows. He then reloaded and fired a salvo of three at Royal Oak,which all hit.There were probably four explosions, one right forward the starboard side,the remainder extending from &quot; A &quot; to &quot; X &quot; turrets on the starboard side. Alltorpedoes seem to have hit the side, and there is no evidence to suggest a magneticpistol or any explosion under the bottom.We have investigated the suggestion that the presence of baulks of timberfloating past the ship may have had something to do with the attack, but believe this may be explained by the fact that recently a number of telegraph poles havebeen washed up on the shores of the Flow and may have floated off again on thehigh tide of this night. Also, a certain amount of timber, shores, &amp;c, may havedropped out of, or been blown out of, the ship&apos;s forward compartments &quot;by thefirst explosion.State of Royal Oak on night of 13/14 October, 1939.The ship was adequately prepared against air attack except that most of thelower and main deck scuttles had light-excluding ventilators in them for the sake of habitability. She was properly darkened except that she was burning shadedriding lights.   There were adequate look-outs on deck.Great reliance was placed on the Scapa Air Raid Warning, and if an air raid warning had been received, scuttles and dead-lights would have been closedand riding lights extinguished. No such warning was received, and it was not until the second, third and fourth explosions occurred in quick succession that anyone realised that an enemy attack had been made. Consequently, no additionalprecautions were taken after the first explosion; after the other explosions light and power failed, and the ship heeled over and sank so quickly that nothing couldbe done. Individual lifebelts had not been supplied to the ship, so that men had only the limited quantity of floats, wood, &amp;c, which had been thrown or floatedover the side to help them.   These were very inadequate.Considering that the ship was in harbour and that the sea was calm the lossof life appears to have been very heavy. We put this down to the fact that theship was at Air Defence Stations, so that an abnormally large number of menwere stationed below the main deck. Their escape from the ship was probablyimpeded by the number of water-tight doors that were closed. It has also been stated that a number of men probably took shelter under armour and betweendecks in the belief that an air raid was taking place, as they had been taughtto do so.Recommendations.We consider that: 1. If there is any possibility of attack, small calibre guns should be mannedin addition to the H.A. guns and searchlights.2. On any sign of attack or internal explosion all scuttles and deadlightsshould be immediately closed.3. Riding lights should not be shown.4. Every sliding hatch should slide fore-and-aft and not athwartships.5. Individual lifebelts should be provided for every man.6. There should be two immediate visual signals :  (1) A general alarm to indicate that the enemy is thought to be attacking.(2) An immediate distress signal to indicate that a ship needs assistance.Note. Certain emergency distress signals are given in the Firework table in the F.S.B. The first distress signal is given as a succession of redrockets. We are not aware that H.M. Ships are supplied with redrockets.
7. In regard to scuttles and deadlights, we do not consider that closingthese would have saved the ship. It might, however, have caused her to sink-more slowly and to heel over less violent])- in the first five or ten minutes. had this happened the loss of life would probably have been smaller.S. We are of the opinion that an order to close all maindeck scuttles afterthe first explosion would have been a wise precaution, but this is influenced bya knowledge of after events. At the time, the Captain considered that the explosion was internal and local. We do not consider (as already stated) thatthis action would have saved the ship, even if the scuttles had been closed in time.Otherwise, we consider that Captain W. G. Benn and his Officers did all that waspossible to save their ship. Captain Benn remained in the ship until the lastpossible moment, until, in fact, the.ship left him, and his behaviour was in thebest traditions of the Service.We deplore the death of Rear-Admiral H. E. C. Blagrove, a serious loss with.M. Service, which was due to his refusing the lifebuoy that was offered to him.and spending all his time in helping others to save themselves.(Signed)      G. C, MUIRHEAD GOULD, Captain, R.N.R. H. T. RAIKES, Vice-Admiral.R, E. E. DRAX, Admiral.
MOST SECRET.ANNEX IV.JReport of a Sub-Committee of the Beard of Admiralty appointed to review theaction at all relevant stages in respect of the defences of Scapa Flow againstsubmarine attack.I. Review of action taken.The problem of defending Scapa Flow against submarine attack is toprevent penetration by submarines into the Flow by any of seven Sounds. Threeforms of defence have been adopted, anti-submarine booms, blockships and patrol vessels, and the first section of our report is mainly a review of the action taken before the sinking of H.M.S. Royal Oak in respect of each of them.2. The plans for the defence of Scapa generally are laid down in &quot; InterimDefence Scheme Scapa,&quot; a document submitted by the Rear-Admiral andCommanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, to the Admiralty from time to time, withrevisions to bring it up to date on each occasion. Thus, a revision was submitted on 4th June, 1938, another on 28th November, 1938, and another on 31st March,1939.  Admiralty replies were sent making certain further amendments in detail.3. The latest edition of the scheme was issued by the Commander-in-Chief,Rosyth, on 1st September, 1939. So far as the present enquiry is concerned, itstates that &apos;&apos; local naval defence measures will be provided against attack by mine or torpedo on shipping in the approaches or attack by torpedo on ships inthe harbour. These measures will consist of A/S booms across Hoxa. Switha andHoy Sounds and patrols of M/S and A/S vessels in the approaches.&quot; A similar statement was made in earlier editions of the scheme. The scheme did not make provision for patrolling the three booms of the four eastern Sounds, where thereare no booms, but blockships.4. In addition to the Interim Scheme issued by Rear-Admiral andCommanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, (later Commander-in-Chieffc Rosyth), theCommander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, issued in February 1939 a plan entitled&quot;Scapa Flow Provisional Defence Scheme,&quot; which contains provisionalmeasures to be taken for the defence of Scapa Flow &quot; until such time as theproper defence organisation laid down is established.&quot; The following points inthis plan are relevant: (a) If the booms in Hoxa, Switha and Hoy Sounds were not completeindicator nets were to be laid.(b) If the blocking of Kirk Sound (the northernmost of the four easternSounds) was not completed the blocking of it should be made more effective by the use of wire hawsers, nets, or some other method.(c) Drifters were to be detailed as an A/S patrol, one outside the booms inHoxa and Switha Sounds and one to the westward of the boom inHoy Sound. Drifters for these duties would be detailed by theCommander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.5. An Orkneys and Shetlands General Memorandum of the 1st October,1939, referring to Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleefs, Scheme of February,stated that patrols were to be established as follows : (X) Hoxa Boom, (Z) SwithaBoom, (Y) Hoy Boom. The object of the patrols was to prevent enemy submarinesentering Scapa Flow either through the booms or through the gates when theywere open.  The memorandum did not provide for patrolling the eastern Sounds.6. Against the background of these plans we turn to consideration of thethree forms of defence.
A nti-Submarine Boom Defences.7. This form of defence, consisting of booms with pendant nets, was adopted at three of the seven Sounds, Hoxa. Switha and Hoy. Tt was not adopted at thefour eastern entrances because the current there was too swift.8. Continuous and successful efforts to improve the efficiency of boom and net defences have been made since the last war. Nevertheless, it remains necessaryto have a reasonable clearance beneath the nets, or fouling of the nets and eventhe sinking of the whole defence may occur.9. A/S booms are not designed to prevent submarines on the &quot;surface frompassing. Thus in an Admiralty letter of 2nd August, 1939, to Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland. Senior Naval Officer.Scapa, and Boom Defence Officer, Scapa, it was stated that &quot; A/S booms are not designed to stop submarines on the surface, but reliance must be placed on patrol craft to deal with them. It is, however, considered unlikely that submarineswould attempt to force their way across the booms on the surface.&quot;10. A single line of net defences for Scapa was proposed in 1930, and theexisting defences were approved in 1936. The intention was to bring the defencesto thirty-five days&apos; notice. In the summer of 1938 it was decided to reduce theperiod of notice., The Hoxa Boom was in place at the time of the crisis ofSeptember 1938. Work on the booms at Switha and Hoy still continued. Onthe 23rd August, 1939, a message was received from Commanding Officer, Coast ofScotland, saying : &quot; Scapa Boom Defences are in immediate readiness.&quot;11. Thus the boom defences of Hoxa, Switha and Hoy Sounds were fullycomplete in accordance with plans on the night of the sinking of the Royal Oak.12. The adequacy of the boom defences was reconsidered in June 1939.when Rear-Admiral and Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, pointed outthat, when they were originally planned, Scapa was classed as a Naval Anchorage,whereas by a decision of January 1939 it had become the main Fleet Base.Nevertheless, it was still protected by an A/S A 2 Boom single line of A/S nets.Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, also considered that a second line of A/S nets,to give complete security against submarines, was most desirable at the threebooms.13. The Admiralty reply of 2nd August stated that their Lordshipsconsidered that, in view of the tidal conditions, a single line of A/S nets provided a good measure of security against entry of a submarine into Scapa Flow.Security would be further increased by the arrival of auxiliary A/S vessels.Further possible measures were, however, suggested : (i) to double the Hoxa A/Sboom; (ii) to place Anti-Torpedo baffles, inside the Switha boom; (iii) to placeAnti-Torpedo baffles to the eastward of the capital ship berths as a protection against Torpedo Boat attack. The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, andCommanding Officer. Coast of Scotland, were asked for their observations on thenecessity for increasing the boom defences on these lines, in the light of all thecircumstances, namely, cost, depletion of reserves and the additional maintenancewhich would be required.14. On 6th September, three days after the outbreak of war, the deputy director of Local Defence visited Scapa and discussed the defences with theChief of Staff, Home Fleet. The Chief of Staff rather favoured a controlledminefield instead of doubling the Hoxa boom and, as the berthing plan scatteredthe ships, he did not consider that an A/T baffle for the fleet anchorage was required.15. After a visit by D.C.N.S. later in September it was decided to laycontrolled minefields at Port A, Scapa and Cromarty, in that order of priority.On 25th September Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, replying to the Admiraltyletter of 2nd August, said that he did not consider the provision of A/T bafflesfor the Fleet anchorage necessary or desirable, and that he would prefer a systemof loops and controlled minefields, on the lines indicated by D.C.N.S., to doubling the Hoxa boom and placing A/T baffles inside the Switha boom. The controlledminefields had not been laid by the night of 13th-14th October.
16. The Admiralty view of the security given by a single net (expressedin the letter of 2nd August) was supported by trials carried out by the Seawolfon 22nd August. 1939, which showed that although a submarine heavily armed with explosive cutters should penetrate the standard single line A/S net she would be detected on passing through.Blockships.17. In the four Eastern Sounds, Water Sound, East Wed del Sound, SkerrySound and Kirk Sound, it was not practicable to have A/S booms, and blockshipshave formed the main defence.   Some blockships remain from the last war.18. On 1st February. 1938. the Admiralty asked Commanding Officer. coast of Scotland, to report whether he had any information showing the extent towhich the blockships sunk in the four eastern Sounds at the beginning of thelast war still remained an effective obstruction at all states of the tide to thepassage of a small submarine drawing ten feet and of thirteen feet beam. Inreply Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, said, briefly, that he considered(a) 2 or 3 big concrete blocks, properly spaced, would completely close WaterSound for navigation, (b) There were three sunken ships in East Weddel Sound.Local information was that no vessel would consider even approaching the sound, (c) The Skerry Sound Channel was out of the question for navigation.(//) The wrecks in Kirk Sound left a clear deep passage 300-400 feet wide throughthe Sound. Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, thought that a local concretebarge, suitable for use in the Sound, might be obtained.19. On 3rd May the Admiralty asked Commanding Officer. Coast ofScotland, for proposals and estimates of cost for laying the concrete blocks inWater Sound and the barge in Kirk Sound. The Commander-in-Chief. home fleet, actually bought the barge in September, 1938. and on 22nd October theAdmiralty asked Commanding Officer. Coast of Scotland, to arrange for sinkingii in Kirk Sound.20. On 3rd November, Commanding Officer. Coast of Scotland, reportedthat Mr. Mackenzie, of Metal Industries. Limited, did not consider that thebarge would block Kirk Sound completely. He requested that a survey of KirkSound should be carried out to see whether this was so. The Admiralty replied(in 18th November that a re-survey should not be necessary, as one was already available and would be forwarded, when a further report should be made.21. As a result of this further report from Commanding Officer. Coast ofScotland, the Admiralty approved on 28th December that Metal Industries.Limited, should be invited to tender for a shell 300-350 feet in length to besunk in Kirk Sound, and that the concrete barge, already bought, should be sunkin Water Sound to block the narrow navigable channel. The barge was success-fully sunk in Water Sound on 28th February, 1939. and the blocking of KirkSound by sinking the S.S. Soriano was said to be completed on 15th March.On 8th February the Admiralty had informed Commanding Officer. Coast ofScotland, that an experienced surveying officer would attend both sinkings tomake sure that the vessels were correctly placed, and to plot their positions.22, On 24th March, 1939, Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, reportedthat he considered the Soriano and Thames (a vessel already sunk in Kirk Sound)together with a broken-up blockship already there, formed an effective barrier-to passage through the main Kirk Sound Channel. The four Eastern entrances to the Flow were now, he said, for the most part effectively blocked, but he wenton to say that reports from the King&apos;s Harbour Master, Invergordon and MetalIndustries, Limited. &quot; disclosed for the first time that navigable channels stillexist through Kirk Sound (between the broken-up blockship south of Thamesand Lamb Holm) and through Skerry Sound.&quot; He therefore asked that a comprehensive survey might be carried out. The Admiralty approved this on20th April and the survey was carried out by H.M.S. Scott in May. commanding officer, Coast of Scotland, was also asked on 20th April to arrange for anobstruction of chain cables or wires to be made to bar the gap between the thames and the Soriano.[20313]D
23. On 21st April, Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, represented thatthe urgency of any further action to be taken was increasing, because MetalIndustries, Limited, who would carry out the work, were moving their gearaway. In addition to the gaps in Kirk and Skerry Sounds he now mentionedalso&apos; a gap in Water Sound, to the north of the concrete barge. On 8th may the Admiralty approved of his obtaining estimates for further obstructionsin Kirk, Water and Skerry Sounds.24. On 17th May, Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, submittedestimates and proposals accordingly stating that the navigable channels were much larger than had been suspected. The first reaction in the Admiralty wasto propose to reply that the only remaining navigable channel for a submarinetrimmed down or submerged was considered to be the southern gap in Kirk Sound,and that a ship was accordingly to be bought and sunk there. In view of theremaining risk of small submarines or surface craft getting through on the surface the question of patrols would require consideration.25. Before this reply was sent, however, the report of ELMS. Scotfs survey was received. As a result of this. Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, and.Commanding Officer. Coast of Scotland, were informed by the Admiralty on the26th May that the survey indicated that &quot; no risk at present exists of submergedentry of submarines by Holm [this includes Kirk, Skerry and East WeddelSounds] or Water Sounds, and that entry on surface would be extremelyhazardous.26. &quot; Their Lordships doubt if the further blocking measures proposed would be final or could be relied upon to provide hundred per cent, security against a determined attempt at entry of enemy craft on surface, though such anattempt is considered extremely unlikely.27. &quot; It has therefore been decided that further expenditure on blockingcannot be justified.28. &quot; Commanding Officer. Coast of Scotland, is requested to inform MetalIndustries of this decision, expressing Their Lordships&apos; appreciation of theirvaluable assistance in investigating the question.29. &quot; Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, is requested to report in view ofthis decision whether he considers it will be necessary to provide for security bythe provision of any patrol craft.&quot;30. In reply to this telegram Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, on31st May recommended that three patrol vessels should be provided and asked for large-scale copies of the ScoWs survey. Copies of the survey were sent, and inan Admiralty minute of 13th June it is stated that arrangements were beingmade for the provision of the three patrol craft, but that in the early stages this requirement would have to be met by Fleet drifters.31. In his letter of 1st June, 1939 (see paragraph 12), pointing out thatScapa was no longer merety a Naval Anchorage, but the main Fleet Base.Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland, also asked that reconsideration might begiven to the Admiralty decision not to undertake further blocking of SkerrySound, in view of H.M.S. Scotfs report of 19th May to the Hydrographerthat &quot; in a channel nearly 300 feet wide a depth of 24-25 &quot;feet could be maintained on a steady course from east to west into Scapa Flow.&quot; The view expressed inthe Admiralty was that the question of blocking had been most carefully examined. It was considered that the present risk of entry by an enemy submarine was small, and, in any case, it was doubted whether additionalblocking would ever be final or provide absolute security.32. &quot; On 28th June Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, also asked that theAdmiralty decision not to carry out further blocking might be reconsidered. he considered, from a study of the large-scale surveys, that three straight channelsexisted, two in Kirk Sound and one in Skerry Sound,, through which submarinesor destroyers could enter. If these channels were closed by blockships, patrol vessels would be unnecessary (except at the very start of a war, when they wouldbe provided by Fleet resources). Unless these channels were blocked, theCommander-in-Chief at Scapa in war time could not be free from constantanxiety as to the safety of his ships from attack in harbour, as patrols (being
human) could not give the same security as a blocked channel. The Commander-in-Chief referred to experiments carried out by the Admiral Commanding,Orkneys and Shetlands, designate, in the Sounds which confirmed his view.33. These representations caused the Admiraly to modify their views, andthey approved on 10th July the purchase of three further blockships throughMetal Industries, Ltd. Negotiations for the purchase of suitable ships followed.The Cape Ortegal was sunk in Skerry Sound on September 8th. Orders for the fixing of wires and cables, instead of a ship, to obstruct the gap between theSoriano and the Thames were given on September 12th. The vessel which wasto block the last gap, in Kirk Sound, arrived at Scapa the day after the RoyalOak was sunk.Patrol Vessels.34.   Patrol vessels were required both on the three booms at Hoxa, Hoy and.Switha, and on the Eastern Sounds until they were effectively blocked againstvessels both submerged and on the surface.35. The craft required for the booms were provided for in Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleefs, &quot; Scapa Flow Provisional Defence Scheme.&quot; They wereto be fleet drifters detailed by the Commander-in-Chief. The orders in force onthe night of the loss of the Royal Oak were contained in the Orkneys andShetlands memorandum of 1st October, quoted in paragraph 5, and two drifterswere patrolling, at Hoxa and Hoy booms.36. The possible need for patrol craft on the Eastern Sounds had been realised by the Admiralty. The Commander-in-Chief. Home Fleet, was asked inAdmiralty telegram of 26th May, 1939, whether he considered additional patrol craft would be necessary for this purpose. The need was affirmed by theCommander-in-Chief in his reply, in which he asked for three vessels. At thesame time it was realised that at the beginning of the war the need would haveto be met from Fleet resources (Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet&apos;s letter of28th June, 1939, quoted in paragraph 32 above).37. On the night of the sinking of the Royal Oak the Commander-in-Chiefhad a total of 13 drifters under his Command, of which he had taken withhim 6 to Port A, leaving 5 at Scapa and 2 at Sullum Voe under admiral commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands. Admiral Commanding, Orkneys andShetlands, detailed 2 of those at Scapa to patrol the booms. None patrolled theeastern Sounds.38. As regards the provision of Patrol craft, on 8th September, 1939.Admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, informed the Admiralty that15 fast craft were required for patrolling booms and indicator nets in his command, as drifters were too slow. The provision of these was approved on20th September, There has. however, been some difficulty in finding and manningsuitable craft, and none had reached Scapa on 13th October. Four left the Clydeon 25th October for Port A and Scapa. and the provision of the rest has beenurgently pressed on.39. The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, has mentioned that in October1938. after experience of the September crisis, he reported that his drifters werewearing out and suggested that as they passed out of service they should bereplaced by Admiralty trawlers. The first of the drifters was not due to passout until January 1940, and the Admiralty reply of 27th April, 1939. gavereasons why Their Lordships had decided that this should be replaced by anotherdrifter when the time came. The Admiralty reply did not say what the policy as regards replacement of later drifters would be.11. Defence of Scapa against submarine attack in the war of 1914-18.40. We have thought it useful to give some attention to the very fulldescriptions of the defences of Scapa in the last war. and the correspondencerelating to them.41.   We have found that a considerable number of blockships were sunk atthe headlining; of the war.  No less than fourteen had been sunk by the beginningof December 1914 in the eastern Sounds.   There were also guns and searchlights[20313] D 2
protecting these entrances. As the war progressed boom defences were laid notonly across the three Sounds where they are now laid, but also across the innerpart of Holm Sound, that is, within the line of the blockships.42. In the winter of 1915-16 heavy gales destroyed a large part of the boomdefences. Admiral Jellicoe gave it as his opinion that the Holm boom need notbe replaced provided that one or two unseaworthy sailing vessels or steamshipswere kept at Scapa to replace any of the blockships which might break up. Theblockships themselves, however, were not considered sufficient to give security,as is shown by the fact that the gun and searchlight defences of the easternSounds established in 1914 were increased in 1915.111. Comments.43. Our main comment is on the absence of patrol craft or guns and search-lights at the Eastern Sounds. The Admiralty view (paragraph 25 et seq.) wasthat any attempt to enter the Flow by any of the Eastern sounds was extremely unlikely. At the same time, it recognised that security was not complete withoutpatrol craft. That the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, shared this view and considered that patrolling of the Eastern sounds was necessary, is shown by hisasking for three craft for the purpose (paragraph 30) and by his letter of28th June, 1939 (paragraph 32), in which he said that if three channels then stillconsidered .to be open were to be closed by blockships, patrol vessels would be unnecessary. But it was known on the night of October 13 that one at least ofthese channels remained unblocked. It is true that Admiral Commanding.Orkneys and Shetlands, had only five drifters at his disposal at the time, ofwhich one would be boiler cleaning and two were patrolling the booms, but thelocal orders made no provision for patrolling the eastern Sounds. We conclude that the risk of an enemy submarine entering by the eastern Sounds, which theAdmiralty itself had considered to be very slight, was accepted by the Com-mander-in-chief, Home Fleet, and Admiral Commanding, Orkneys andShetlands.44. As regards blockships we are left with the impression that the problemof blocking the eastern Sounds, before the War, was not handled as adequatelyas its importance deserved. The measures first reported by Commanding Officer,Coast of Scotland, to be required (paragraph 18) were taken, by sinking the concrete barge in Water Sound and the Soriano in Kirk Sound (paragraph 21).Subsequently, two more gaps were reported in Kirk Sound, one in Skerry sound and one in Water Sound (paragraphs 22 and 23). On 26th May, 1939, as wehave observed, the Admiralty decided against buying further blockships. On10th July, in response to representations by Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet,the Admiralty modified their decision in respect of the gaps in Kirk Sound andSkerry Sound. Had this decision been taken in May the last ship would nodoubt have been sunk in Kirk Sound before 13th October instead of after. Butwe do not wish to imply that the Admiralty decision of May was necessarilywrong. The real fault lay in the variety of views as to what was required :Commanding Officer, Coast of Scotland&apos;s report early in 1938, his second reportin March 1939, the Admiralty&apos;s view after seeing H.M.S. Scotfs survey in May.1939, and Commander-in-Chief. Home Fleets view in June, 1939, after the admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, designate, had carried out hisexperiments, all gave different estimates of the requirements.45. We have dealt in some detail with the Eastern Sounds as there is ageneral consensus of opinion that the submarine may have made her entiy anddeparture by Kirk Sound. The report from Commanding Officer, Coast ofScotland, of 24th March, 1939, referred to in paragraph 22, gives added weight to this possibility. Admiral French, who paid a personal visit to Kirk Sound,also discounted the difficulty of passage by a submarine on the surface or by a destroyer (vide enclosure No. 3 to Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleefs letter of19th October to Admiral Drax).46. The Board of Enquiry, in paragraphs 6 and 7 of their report, refer toall the possible means by which the submarine may have entered, including Hoxa.Switha or Hoy Sounds. At each of these the net defence was in position andremained intact, and at Hoxa and Hoy the boom was being watched by a drifter
Appointment of Sub-Committee and Terms of Reference.The First Lord has appointed a Sub-Committee of the Board consisting ofthe Second Sea Lord and Fourth Sea Lord, and has referred to them the firstsection of the Report of the Board of Enquiry, presided over by Admiral Drax,into the circumstances attending the loss of the Royal Oak (namely, that sectionof the Report which includes remarks upon certain deficiencies in the defencesof Scapa), together with the letter from the C-in-C. Home Fleet, to admiral Drax, No. H.F. 0490/429, dated the 19th October, 1939.The First Lord desires the Sub-Committee to prepare, for the informationof himself and the Board, a review of, and commentary upon, the action taken atall relevant stages by -the various authorities, both within the Admiralty and outside it, who were concerned with the existing defences at Scapa againstsubmarine attack, in relation to:  (a) the planning of those defences; and(b) the provision made for them; and(c) the actual maintenance and operation of the defences provided; and(d) the assistance given by patrols from the Fleet.at each. The boom at Switha, admittedly the least likely Sound through which an entry might be made, was not watched.&apos; Of the remaining 3 drifters at Scapa,one was boiler cleaning and two were standing off.47. In paragraph 7 of their report the Board of Enquiry drew attention tothe gaps between the shore and the ends of the Hoxa, Switha and Hoy Booms, andalso to the gap under the Hoxa net. A submarine passing round the nets on the surface, or surfacing after having passed under the Hoxa net by night should bedetected by the patrol vessel. These gaps in the net defences should be reduced tothe minimum practicable.48. As regards the operation of the boom gates, we would draw attentionto the remark of the Board of Enquiry that they were sometimes kept open longer than necessary.IV. Future Action.49. As regards the last part of our terms of reference, we have noted(Section II) that in 1914-18 reliance was placed upon guns and searchlights togive added security from surface attack through any of the seven Sounds. Wefurther note that the Board of Enquiry recommend that look-outs, guns andsearchlights on shore should be established at all partially-blocked entranceswhich cannot be blocked completely. We agree that this form of defence shouldlie considered as an alternative or addition to patrol craft.50. We have not thought it useful to comment further upon therecommendations for future action contained in the first section of the reportof the Board of Enquiry, in view of the decision that Scapa is not at present to be the main Fleet Base, but is to remain only as a fuelling base. Even so. the defences will, no doubt, require strengthening.51. In accordance with our terms of reference we have consulted Admiralthe Hon. R. A. R. Plunkett- Ernle-Erle-Drax in the preparation of our report,and he is in general agreement with its terms.52. A copy of the note appointing the Sub-Committee and setting out its terms of reference is attached.CHARLES LITTLE.GEOFFREY S. ARBUTHNOT.F. W. Mottershead, Secretary.1st November, 1939.
Admiral Drax will be associated with the Sub-Committee, and will afford itassistance in any direction which they may desire.The Sub-Committee is not required to report upon the action to be taken onthe recommendations contained in the first section of Admiral Drax&apos;s Report for improving the defences; though they will be free to make to the First Sea Lordany suggestions on this subject which may occur to them as a. result of their investigations.Mr. Mottershead. of M. Branch, will act as Secretary to the Sub-Committee.(Initialled) R. H. A. C.28th October, 1939.
