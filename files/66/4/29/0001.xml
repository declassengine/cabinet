We have set out below at some length the main factors of the problem with our conclusions and recommendations.Military Aim.2. The underlying assumption on which this policy is to be based is theconclusion reached by the Ministry of Economic Warfare to the effect that the stoppage of the entire Swedish exports of iron ore to Germany &quot; might wellbring German industry to a standstill and would in any case have a profoundaffect on the duration of the war.&quot; It is, of course, of vital importance to besure that this is, in fact, an accurate statement of the position. On this we arenot competent to advise, but we would point out that the recommendations whichemerge from this paper are entirely based on the assumption, drawn from theabove conclusion, that the stoppage of the exports of iron ore to Germany wouldbe decisive.3. We emphasise that this Report deals only with the various situationswhich might arise, if we ourselves were to take action to stop the export of swedish iron ore to Germany, and does not take into account the possibility ofthe Germans anticipating us and taking the initiative in Scandinavia. We offer some general observations on this possibility at the conclusion of our Report. Onthese assumptions our military aim will be to gain control over as great a volumeof Swedish iron ore exports as we can, and to retain that control for a sufficiently long time, to bring German)&apos;- to the point of surrender.* W.M. (39) 122nd Conclusions, Minute 1.
SECTION I.ANALYSIS OF  SWEDEN*S  IRON  ORE  EXPORTS.   .4. Germany&apos;s principal interest in Scandinavia is iron ore. The effect on germany&apos;s war effort of a stoppage of all, or some of, the nine million tons ofore which she requires to draw annually from Sweden has been the subject of detailed investigation by the Ministry of Economic Warfare * An analysis ofthe results of that investigation is essential if military objectives are to be clearly defined, and is made in the paragraphs which follow.5. The main Swedish iron ore deposits are in the Gaiivare area of NorthernSweden, whence ore is exported from the Baltic port of Lulea in summer andthe Norwegian port of Narvik in winter. Lulea is normally ice-bound from mid-December to mid-April. Although ore cannot be conveyed through the Gulf ofBothnia during these months, rail deliveries from the mines to Lulea continuethroughout the winter; with the result that, by the middle of April, there is usually a large accumulation of ore at that port awaiting shipment.6. There is a smaller iron ore field at Grangesberg, about 100 miles north-west of Stockholm. The potential output of this field does not exceed five million tons a year. Moreover, although the ore is rich in iron content, it is too deficientin phosphorus to be an adequate substitute for the ores of the northern field, sincethe bulk of the German steel industry is based on the Bessemer process for whicha high percentage of phosphorus is necessary. Grangesberg ore is exported toGermany all the year round from Baltic ports, of which Oxelosund, which is kept open during the winter by ice-breakers, is far the most important.7. The loading capacity of the Swedish and Norwegian ports concerned isequal to, or exceeds, the capacity of the railways to deliver ore for shipment.Subject, therefore, to the potential output of the ore fields themselves, it is therailways, and not the ports, which are the governing factor in the amount of orewhich Germany can obtain from Sweden.8. It should be realised that Germany does not lack competent technicians.If, for instance, we closed one or more sources of Swedish iron ore to her, she would strain every nerve to increase output from other Swedish ore fields, railwaysand ports quite apart from any military action she might take. The statisticswhich follow are based, therefore, on theoretical maximum deliveries from variousports, and not on present deliveries.9. The capacities of the ports concerned and the maximum deliveries whichare believed to be possible, taking railway and other limiting factors into account,are as follows : Port.	Monthly capacity of port. Tonnage.	Theoretical maximum deliveries taking railway limitations into account. Tonnage.		Governing factors.Narvik  ... Lulea Oxelosund Gavle arid other Southern Swedish  ports	1,500,000 600,000 900,000 100,000	Monthly. Summer.      Winter. 1,050,000     750,000 600,000         Nil 450,000     450,000 80,000       80,000	Annually. Millions, (o) 11-4 (6) 4-8 5-4 1 \ 0-96 J	Ice in winter. But only a total of 5 million tons, if export is confined to the Grangesberg field.Notes. (a) The actual export of iron ore from Narvik is not only appreciably less than11-4 million tons, but a considerable amount of it goes to other countries than Germany.   For instance, 2  million tons are exported to Great Britain.(b) Practically the entire export from Lulea is taken by Germany.* W.P. (G) (39) 153 of the 18th December, 1939.
10.   Prom this table it is clear that: (a) Jf exports from Narvik only were stopped, Germany could still obtainbetween 9 and 10 million tons of iron ore through Baltic ports.(b) If the entire exports of the northern field were stopped, Germany would be confined to the Grangesberg deposits, which, at most, would give heronly 5 million tons of ore in one year instead of the 9 million sheneeds.The Minister of Economic Warfare estimates that such a closure&quot; might well bring German industry to a standstill and would, in anycase, haye a profound effect on the duration of the war.&quot;(c) If, in addition to Narvik and Lulea, the exports from Oxelosund could also be stopped, or even interrupted for some months, Germany&apos;position would clearly be exceptionally grave.11. The length of time for which it would be necessary to prevent the exportof Swedish iron ore to Germany7 in order to bring the latter to the point of surrender must necessarily be a matter of speculation. Although the amount ofsteel semi-manufactures existing in Germany at the outbreak of war is not known,German reserves of crude ore are estimated not to have exceeded three to four months&apos; requirements. The only sources from wdiich Germany might replaceSwedish ore are Russia and, perhaps, Luxemburg. Deliveries from Russia are unlikely to exceed one million tons of poor quality ore before 1941; and Germanyalready takes a proportion of the available ore from the Luxemburg fields.The most that can be said, therefore, is that we should try to stop the exportof Swedish ore to Germany for at least one year. The situation after that is notpredictable.12.   Our military objectives can now be summarised as follows : (a) We must stop the export of iron ore to Germany from the Northern field.i.e., through Narvik and Lulea and the railways leading from Galivareto Southern Sweden, for one year.   In the case of Lulea this means..   for practical purposes, a stoppage from April to December.(b) It is desirable to stop, or to interrupt for a period of some months, theexport of Grangesberg ore through the port of Oxelosund, provided this can be done at relatively little cost to ourselves.SECTION II.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.Necessity for Norwegian and Swedish co-operation.13. The attitude of Norway and Sweden has a very material bearing on the feasibility of British military operations in Scandinavia.A study of the communications in the north leads us to conclude that amilitary expedition inland from Narvik in the face of either Norwegian orSwedish opposition is not a feasible operation. Our reasons are, briefly, asfollows : Firstly, we should have to prepare for a landing, probably opposed,under severe climatic conditions, and without many of the existing port facilities,which might have been demolished. Secondly, it would be a simple matter forthe Norwegians or Swedes to make the railway running inland from Narvikunusable, either by the removal of rolling-stock or the cutting off of electric power,even if they7 did not demolish it (and the Norwegians are known to have mined therailway in six places). In these circumstances we should be faced with an advanceacross very difficult ground, against an enemy who knows the country and is usedto the conditions. There is no road linking Narvik with Galivare, and to build a road would be a difficult undertaking which would take time.
14. Similar considerations apply to an expedition in Southern Norway orSouthern Sweden, which we regard as equally impracticable in the face of norwegian and Swedish opposition.15. We have also given some consideration to the possibility of militaryoperations if the Norwegians and Swedes adopt a purely passive attitude, whichthey might do through fear of antagonising Germany, binder these conditions we could not count on the ready co-operation of port and railway authorities;and, although a military expedition might not be impossible, we feel that weshould suffer such serious delays that the resulting loss of time would probablybe decisive.16. For these reasons we are convinced that Norwegian and Swedishco-operation is essential, and the remainder of this paper is written on theassumption that that co-operation is obtained.Limitation of our commitment in Scandinavia.17. We anticipate that part of the price of obtaining this co-operation maybe the promise of substantial Allied military and air support in southern sweden, which is the most highly developed and populated part of the countryand also the area most vulnerable to German attack. Moreover, as we showlater, operations in Southern Scandinavia are desirable for purely military reasons, in order to obtain strategic cover for the more important operation inthe north. We examine the possibility of operating in Southern Sweden inSection IV. The point we wish to make here is that it may not be possible to confine our commitment in Scandinavia to a small expedition in the north.Necessity for taking the initiative.18. We would also point out that the chances of controlling Germany&apos;imports of iron ore from Sweden would be very gravely prejudiced if Germanytook the initiative in Scandinavia, even if she confined her action to sabotage ofthe Narvik railway, which she might well do if she got to hear of our plans. we know that Germany has collected shipping and that she could invade Sweden at short notice. Secrecy of plan and speed in execution are necessary to our success,if we decide to operate in Scandinavia.Shipping situation.19. We understand that the shipping position is at present causing considerable anxiety, and the provision of adequate shipping will, of course, bean essential part of a plan to land and maintain forces in Scandinavia. Anyshortage of shipping, however, should not be allowed to stand in the Way of theexecution of a plan which offers a prospect of being decisive. If necessary, wemust restrict our imports and &quot; tighten our belts &quot; to make the necessary shipping available.German and Russian counter-measures in Scandinavia.20. The strategical results of carrying the war into Scandinavia arereviewed in their broader aspect in Section V. For the sake of clearness, it isdesirable at this point to summarise possible German counter-measures in scandinavia itself. &quot; There are three areas in which Germany might decide toact Northern Sweden, Southern Sweden and Southern Norway. In the first two,her object would be to gain control of the Swedish iron ore fields; in the third, herobject would be to establish bases from which to challenge our control of sea communications. These counter-measures are considered in detail in theirrespective sections.Whether Russia would regard intervention by the Allies in Scandinavia as asuitable pretext for open hostilities or not we are unable to say, but it is apossibility which must be taken into account.
SECTION III.EXAMINATION   OF  METHODS  OF  STOPPING  THE  EXPORT  of iron ORE FROM THE GALIYARE FIELD.Naval action.21. The stoppage of the export of ore from Narvik by naval action presentslittle military difficulty, but as we have already observed, action against thissupply alone would not achieve the military aim defined above.Sabotage.22. Before considering action by military forces it is necessary to examinebriefly the possibilities of sabotage.The main considerations appear to be these: Firstly, it would be disadvantageous to us to sabotage the mines themselves or the transit arrange-ments via Narvik,, since it would deprive us of important supplies-as well as theGermans. It would at the same time deny the use of this line of communication to our military forces if at a later date we desired to take military action inthat area. Secondly, from the information at our disposal, it is doubtful whether any points exist on the railway between the mines and Lulea, the sabotage ofwhich wrould have lasting effects.23. The most sensitive bottleneck on the Lulea outlet is probably the loadingfacilities at the port, and sabotage, if thoroughly carried out here, might be effective for from five to six months. To achieve this result it would be necessaryto employ a large amount of material and highly qualified personnel. Agentsacting by themselves would be unlikely to effect damage of a lasting nature.When the harbour is free from ice it might be possible to block it by other thannaval means, but no reliance could be placed on the block being effective for any length of time.24. In view of the probable reluctance of the Swedes to damage their ownproperty, we could not place any reliance on them to effect the necessary sabotage,if left to themselves. We consider, therefore, that to ensure the thoroughdestruction of the port facilities it would be necessary for us to send a force toLulea with the requisite personnel and stores. We feel that we should have tokeep the force there as long as possible, and at least until the summer, in orderto ensure that the facilities could not be repaired before the port againfreezes up.Military Action.Scope of the Operation.25. In considering the scope of this military operation, certain factors needemphasis. Firstly, its object, as defined, is clearly to stop the export of ore;other forms of action in Sweden are of secondary importance. Secondly, it is vital to anticipate the Germans and to occupy the key points in the Lulea area at the earliest possible date. Thirdly, Lulea must be denied to the enemy for aslong as possible and the necessary demolitions effected prior to any Avithclrawal.We believe this to be possible if a high proportion of trained engineers areincluded in the force and provided the Swedes offer no obstruction.26. The latter point may present serious difficulty, since there is always thedisinclination, which we have referred to. on the part of any people to destroyvaluable national resources. It may be possible, when the need arises, to overcomeSwedish reluctanee-ta-this respect by offering financial compensation; but wethink it important not -to jeopardise Swedish co-operation by any prematuremention of the possibility of demolition.Factors governing the size and operation of a British Force.27. Snow conditions persist at Lulea until the middle of April and, since it is vital to anticipate the Germans in that area, our initial force must be trained
and equipped for movement on snow. Although French Alpini units might be suitable, Canada would probably be the best source on which to draw for personnel of the first contingent, since the employment of French troops would inevitablycomplicate maintenance problems. It is understood that a force of from 5,000 to7,000 Canadians could probably be organised and despatched to reach Narvik inMarch. It is clear that a force of this size would be insufficient to prevent aGerman landing, oppose a German and Russian land advance and safeguardvulnerable points from parachute troops and saboteurs. Any of these threats mavdevelop after April and additional forces will then be required.28. As regards the size of any subsequent contingents, the railway betweenNarvik and Lulea has sufficient capacity to support a force of some six divisionswith a small air force component.f&quot;     Since, however, the railway, which is the only line of communication inland. might be cut by German air attack a point we elaborate later it would be essential to devdpji-aii-axiiLaj^ sufficient to render the forceindependent of regular supplies from Narvik. The building up of such an advanced base would necessarily limit the size of force that could be used. the capacity- of Narvik to serve as a base port for the expedition is under investiga-tion. In addition to Narvik, or in substitution for Narvik if the railway7 betweenNarvik and the mines was cut, use might also be made of Trondheim. The whole matter is essentially one for detailed administrative enquiry, but we think that,with alternative lines of communication and the early creation of advanced depots,we could safely employ7 and maintain one or two divisions in northern Sweden.29. The organisation of the ordinary British division would require con-siderable adaptation for employment in northern Sweden, even during the summer. Large quantities of mechanised transport would not be required and could not be maintained; a proportion of pack^Jj^^jispni^-^ond-mo.untain_.gnnswould be necessary; and mobile lightcarjjnits, whose vehicles might be obtainedlocally, would be useful for reconnaissance down the Bothnian Coast.Naval Factors.30. The Naval Staff are satisfied that it would be possible to transport theforce and maintain the security of its sea communications to Narvik against bothRussian and German opposition. The Home Fleet could provide the necessarycover for these movements. No considerable additional naval commitment is involved apart from the provision of local defences at Narvik. German air attacksfrom aerodromes and seaplane bases in Norway would constitute a threat to these communications, but the scale of attack on ships on passage is not likely to be serious. It will be necessary, however, to establish appropriate air defence measures at the port of Narvik.Nature of the German Land Threat in the Galivare Area.31. The full implications of German counter action are discussed inSection V. It is necessary7 to examine here, however, the possible scale of Germaneffort with which our forces might have to contend in the Galivare area.If the Germans decide to operate in northern Sweden, their one object wouldbe to gain, or regain, control of the ore field, the railway to the Gulf of Bothniaand the port of Lulea as quickly as possible. Ice in the Gulf of Bothnia would,however, prevent an expedition landing in the vicinity of Lulea up to thebeginnjmg^ofMay; and, even in the summer months, a seaborne expedition tothe head orHtneGulf would be a hazardous undertaking in the face of Swedishsubmarines, torpedo-- crafLand^-minefields. The Germans migKiTeven&apos; feet it essential to establish an advanced base in the Aaland Islands before proceedingTurther north. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that our forcesmay have to oppose a landing at, or adjacent to, Lulea in May7.32. Alternatively Germany might decide to invade Southern Sweden, andto make a land advance northwards. The distance from the Stockholm area to thenorthern mine fields is some 450 miles; there are only two lines of railway, androads are few. Consequently no serious German advance could be begun untilthe snow had melted (in April); and even then it would take some weeks, even ifSwedish resistance had been largely overcome. Moreover, we should hope to delayit considerably by demolitions organised from our forces in the Galivare area.
33. The Germans might possibly attempt to seize Lulea or other pointsby parachute troops in conjunction with air landing battalions at Bodenaerodrome. Such an operation would probably be undertaken in conjunctionwith air action or sabotage to delay our advance from Narvik. The Gei -manswould need aerodromes, however, in southern Sweden from which to despatchtheir air transports; and they could not commence the operation until at leastfourteen days after their first landing in southern Sweden. This would denythem the opportunities of surprise. Swedish opposition should largely mitigate the chances of this venture succeeding. On the other hand Swedish forces mightnot be suitably prepared, and it is desirable that our advanced for-ces should reach the Lulea area at the earliest possible date to secure the aerodrome andother key points.Extent of Russian Land Threat to the Galivare A rea.34. If an early Finnish collapse were to take place, and there arc no signsof it at present, the Russians might be able to establish a force, for guerrillawarfare, on the Swedish frontier by about April 1940.Large scale operations by the Russian Army against northern Sweden wouldhave to be preceded not only by the collapse of the Finnish forces, but also by theoccupation of Finland and the repair of Finnish railways, which would probably have been damaged. For these reasons, we see little likelihood of such a threatdeveloping before the middle of next summer.35. On the supposition that the Russians succeed in occupying all Finland,they could probably maintain from four to six divisions on the Swedish frontier in winter. During the summer, when roads are more practicable and shelter fromthe climate is not obligatory, they might increase this up to ten divisions. On theother hand, we should be able to organise considerable guerrilla resistance frombands of Finnish soldiers who had been driven back, and this would increaseresistance to the Russian advance.36. If Russian action were combined with a German invasion of Sweden,clearly our forces might be compelled to give ground, after completing thedemolitions, earlier than if they faced a German advance alone. But, if therewas no German land threat in Sweden, it is probable that the British and Swedishforces together could withstand a Russian land advance indefinitely.Summary of Enemy Land Threat.37. It will be seen, therefore, that, assuming we have Swedish co-operation,no action by enemy land forces is likely to interfere with the establishment of aBritish force in the Lulea-Galivare area. It is improbable that such a force would have to meet severe enemy pressure until at least the middle of May, andthen only if the Germans staged a combined operation to the head of the gulf of Bothnia.Nature of German air threat to our operations in the Galivare Area.A vailable Bases.38. The landing of British troops at Narvik would certainly become knownat once to the Germans, and, owing to their inability to oppose them with land forces, we must anticipate that they would exert every possible means to impedetheir advance by air action. The Germans could not take effective air action frombases more than 600 miles distant, so that bases in Norway and Sweden and adequate fuel supplies of the right type would be essential. In Norway there areonly three bases within 600 miles of Narvik; one of these is at Trondheim, wherethe landing ground is believed to be too small for the operation of modern bombertypes, and two are seaplane anchorages. In Sweden there are eight bases within this 600-mile range. Of these, five are within 400 miles and one, at Boden nearLulea^isjcoilx200 miles distant from Narvik.If Russia suceelKis&quot;ln^cabinet^ we cannot entirely reject thepossibility that German squadrons might be based on the Finnish aerodrome ofKemi, at the head of the Gulf of Bothnia, This would not be possible, for climaticreasons alone, until the end of April.
It is clear therefore that, before Germany can strike effectively at our forcesin the north, she must invade Norwegian and Swedish territory or operate herseaplanes from Norwegian territorial waters.Time Faglax^.The German air force is not equipped for operating off snow. We neednot therefore anticipate any serious attacks on the Narvik-Lulea line, otherthan from seaplanes operating in the Norwegian fjords, until the snow melts atthe beginning of April. Bomber aircraft operating from Germany could, however,reach Trondheim.40. Apart from the snow factor, the start of German attacks against objectives in the north depends on the date of the German invasion of Sweden. if germany has to overcome Swedish resistance in southern Sweden, she will not beable to form air bases in that country until she has established her position on land.There is no military reason, however, to prevent Germany invading southern sweden during the winter and so ensuring that air bases are established in, say,the neighbourhood of Stockholm in time to enable air operations to be commencedagainst objectives on the Narvik line in April. It is doubtful, in the face of swedish opposition and the existence of snow, whether an attempt to secure Bodenaerodrome by air landing parties could be made before mid-April.41. If, however, Germany has not occupied Swedish territory before ourlanding at Narvik, our forces there will meet with no serious air threat untilGerman land forces have reached the Stockholm area and established air installa-tions in the vicinity. It is desirable for these reasons to take the fullest advantageof the railway in the initial stages.Scale of German A ir A attacks.42. The factor governing the scale of air attack which Germany couldlaunch against the Narvik-Lulea line is the number of aerodromes withineffective range and the number of seaplane tenders able to work on the norwegian coast, and not the total number of aircraft she could make available.Apart from Boden, which is within 200 miles of Narvik and adjacent toLulea. the Germans could base about eight bomber squadrons on aerodromeswithin effective range of the Narvik-Lulea area.Possession of Boden and Kemi aerodromes.43. The occupation of Kemi, and to a lesser extent of Boden, aerodromeswould facilitate and increase the scale of any German air attacks in the Narvik-Lulea area. It will be important therefore to take very early measures to assistthe Swedes and Finns in forestalling German attempts to seize these bases.Probable German air objectives.44. The principal objectives open to German attack would be the railway,our base depots and shipping at Narvik, and any aerodromes we had occupied.The railway is both a profitable and vulnerable objective. It is mostlysingle line. Its track is accessible to low flying attacks in many places. Itselectric power, which is conveyed by overhead wire, could be easily damaged.The importance of the line for the maintenance of the force has already been explained.The Germans, in fine weather, would be able to make frequent, possibly dailyattacks, on this objective, and, in view of the small scale of A.A. defences whichare likely to be available along the railway, we must be prepared for seriousinterruptions to traffic.45. Enemy attacks could create severe dislocation at Narvik if we had noanti-aircraft defences. A reasonable scale of defence would, however, reducebombing accuracy, and with proper dispersion on our part it would require ahigh scale of German bombing effort to achieve any serious effect.46. We must, in addition, be prepared for effective attacks against any british air forces established in this area. Owing to the few aerodromesavailable, our squadrons and their only accessible reserves would be a profitabletarget.
Factors affecting the Employment of British Air Forces on the Narvik-Lulealine.47. Before assessing the extent of the threat of German air attack, it isnecessary to examine the possibility of providing air support to our own forces.British air effort in this area is governed by the aerodrome situation.According to present information, there are only three possible aerodromes. Twoof these are north-east of Narvik, 60 and 100 miles distant respectively. Theother is at Boden, which is 25 miles north-west of Lulea. We possess no detailsof the first two and, since they are described as landing grounds in reports, theymay prove unsuitable for modern types of aircraft. Boden is a proper aerodrome,but is only large enough for certain types of fighter and army co-operationaircraft. &quot; It would seem, therefore, that our air effort from land aerodromesmight be limited to these types of squadron. The possibility of obtainingadditional aerodrome sites and using seaplane anchorages is being investigated.48. The above limitations wull seriously restrict the air support we could afford to this operation. Even if the aerodromes north of Narvik prove suitable,we could not at these distances give useful fighter protection over vunerable areas, and none of the aerodromes appears practicable for bombers.49. The early establishment of an army co-operation squadron at Bodenfor reconnaissance work along the Bothnia Coast is, however, very desirable. Inview of the likelihood of the railway to Narvik being interrupted the earlyaccumulation of reserves at Boden for this squadron would be essential.Conclusions as to German air threat to the Galivare area.50. From the foregoing factors we are forced to the conclusion that air force units in the Narvik-Lulea area could do little to ensure the safety of a british force in northern Sweden. It is also necessary to assume that it will be possiblefor the German Air Force to cause perhaps very serious interruptions to the narvik-Lulea railway by air action. It is essential, therefore, that an advancedbase should be built up as soon as possible and that some methods of transportalternative to the railway be organised as a subsidiary means of maintaining the force. An examination is required to determine the use which could be madeof .water transport on Lake Tornetrask.51. It is possible, however, that the air threat may not develop immediately and, since the time factor for the approach of a German land advance should allow us time to consolidate our position at Lulea, we must endeavour to storereserves in that area, sufficient to tide over interruptions in the operation of therailway. Once our forces have established and dispersed themselves betweenGalivare and Lulea, they should not present a vulnerable target to air attack.If we can offset the enemy threat to the rail communications by alternative methods of transport and provide for the A.A. defence of Narvik, enemy air actionalone should not render the operation impracticable.Effect of Rtissian Air Action.52. The extent of the possible Russian air threat to forces operating in the narvik-Lulea area appears at first sight to be considerable. Even fromaerodromes in U.S.S.R. territory the Russians have the aircraft and resources toenable them to reach this area with perhaps 100 bombers. The invasion ofsouthern and central Finland should provide them with at least three additionalaerodromes and allow them correspondingly to increase the intensity of their attck. The inefficiency of the Russian Air Force, however, must reduce very considerably t5e nature of any Russians-air threat to our forces. The presentoperations in Finland have shown the Russians&apos; bombing to be inaccurate, their administration and supply arrangements to be seriously deficient, and their general efficiency to be less than we had expected. It is true that the existingweather conditions in Finland impose difficulties, and that, during summerconditions, the effectiveness of Russian air action may increase. Nevertheless, itis probable that, in spite of the large forces which are theoretically available, the[20550] c
Russian air attack against our forces in northern Sweden will not, in the early stages at least, add seriously to the air threat already anticipated from Germanstriking forces.Conclusions on action to stop exports from the Northern Field.53. Our examination of the military feasibility of stopping the export of iron ore from the northern field may be summarised as follows :  (a) We cannot achieve the desired result by naval means or by sabotage.(b) A military expedition is a practicable operation and will achieve our object in this area provided (i) The Norwegians and Swedes give us full co-operation; and(ii) We reach the key positions before the Germans or Russians.(c) The main features of the necessary military operation would be :  (i) The initial force should consist of one or two brigades,specially equipped for rapid movement and winterconditions, and would have to be in position not later thanthe end of March,(ii) A further contingent of one or two Divisions might have tofollow-shortly afterwards.(iii) We could provide little effective fighter or bomber support for the force. An army co-operation squadron might beemployed if we can seize Boden aerodrome in time.(iv) Enemy air attacks may seriously threaten the railway andthe base at Narvik. An advanced base could, however, be built up, and an alternative line of communication is available via Trondheim. On balance, the risk of the narvik railway being cut after the force has beenestablished can justifiably be accepted,(v) Adequate A.A. defence at Narvik would be essential.SECTION IV.SOUTHERN SCANDINAVIA.54. We pointed out in paragraph 10 that it was desirable to stop the exportof Grangesberg ore through Oxelosund to Germany. This project is, in fact, a natural corollary to the stoppage of ore from the northern field.55. We also explained that substantial military and air assistance in southern Sweden may be the price we shall have to pay for obtaining norwegian and Swedish co-operation in the north. There are two further reasons whyoperations in Southern Scandinavia may be necessary. The first is that, if theGermans established air bases in southern or central Sweden, they would be ableto interfere with the maintenance of any force we had established in the northto a far greater degree than if their aircraft were confined to bases on Germansoil. The second is that, if the Germans succeeded in establishing air and naval bases on the Norwegian coast, they could intensify their attack on our shipping and East Coast ports, and seriously interfere with our sea communications inthe North Sea and Northern Waters. The latter would be particularly important in the circumstances which we are considering.56. For the sake of convenience, we examine our military strategy in southern Scandinavia under three separate headings: (a) The stoppage of exports from the Grangesberg orefield by itself.(b) Operations in Southern Sweden.(c) Operations in Southern Norway/The whole of Southern Scandinavia should, however, be regarded essentially as one military problem.
(a) Stoppage of Exports from the Grangesberg Orefield in Southern Sweden.57. A large part of the Swedish heavy industries depends on theGrangesberg ore, and the railways connecting the orefields with Oxelosund andother Southern Baltic ports pass through the most highly developed districts of scandinavia. It is likely, therefore, that the Swedes would be even morereluctant to cany out extensive demolitions in this area, unless an invadingGerman army had actually landed on Swedish soil, than they would be in thenorth.58. Naval action to stop the export of ore from Oxelosund would be impracticable, but it might be possible, by other than naval means, to arrange forthe harbour to be blocked so as to assist the formation of ice (Oxelosund is kept open in winter by ice breakers). Alternatively7, it might be possible for us to destroy the mechanical loading apparatus at Oxelosund, either with or withoutSwedish connivance, and this would not seriously affect Swedish life or industry.We are advised that the systematic destruction of this apparatus might interruptthe export of iron ore to Germany for six months or more, and we consider the project to be well worth detailed examination.59. We can see no role for a small British force in Southern Sweden. Asmall force could not prevent a German landing or subsequent advance inland;nor. without Swedish goodwill, could it carry7 out demolitions, which the Swedesare perfectly competent to do themselves. We do not consider that the value ofthe Grangesberg ore to Germany7 is sufficient, by itself, to justify7 the employmentof large Allied forces to prevent its export.(b) Operations in Southern Sweden.Topography.60. The country between Malmo, in the extreme south, of Sweden and theline Oxelosund-Lake Vaner, 200 miles further north, is low-lying and extensivelywooded. Communications, particularly railways, are highly developed and capable of supporting large military7 forces. Movement by vehicles off the roadsis, however, difficult, and the Germans could not make much use of theirarmoured divisions.From this &quot; Lake Line&quot; the country becomes steadily more difficult up tothe Grangesberg orefields, 100 miles north-west of Stockholm.The &quot; Lake Line.&quot; i.e., Oxelosund-Norrkoping-Lake Vatter-Lake Vaner,provides a good defensive position against an advance from the south.Two-thirds of it consists of water, which is never frozen over and so is alwaysan obstacle to movement; the ground is generally suitable for anti-tank defence and many of the existing bridges would probably7 not carry heavy tanks.Artillery observation is limited and the woods give extensive cover from aircraft.The Swedish Army.61. The Swedish Army consists of six infantry divisions, one light brigade and two cavalry regiments. Of these, at least one division would probably beretained in the Lulea area, irrespective of any forces we had deployed in northernSweden, and one near Stockholm. This would leave only four divisions for active operations in the south, where the Swedish air force would also Jie Jiopelesslynritnl^y^in^MT^h^rg performance WTf^S^erman&quot;air force. Without Alliedsupport, therefore, Swedish resistance to a German advance could not last long.A German invasion of Southern Sweden.62. If Germany decided to invade Southern Sweden, either to secure theGrangesberg deposits for herself or as a preliminary7 to an advance against our forces in the north, she could adopt one or both of the following courses : (a) A landing in Southern Sweden.(&amp;) A landing in the vicinity of Stockholm.
Either of these courses might be preceded by an attempt to seize aerodromesby means of parachute and air-borne troops. This latter operation would,however, not suffice by itself to secure the orefields and should be regarded only as a preliminary to a sea-borne invasion.63. For some years past much attention has been paid to training theGerman Army in combined operations. Exercises of this kind were carried outin 1937 and 1938 and, more recently, an infantry division and tank brigade were moved to East Prussia by sea for the Polish campaign. The German GeneralStaff and certain formations must, therefore, already have considerable peace-timeexperience in working with the German Navy. Nevertheless, peace experience is not war experience, and we ourselves know only too well how difficult overseasoperations are. In this connection it should be remenibered that it took usthree weeks last September to transport a force of four divisions (150.000 men)to France; and that, after months of concerted planning with our ally, and withall our accumulated experience of combined operations, the transport of asubstantial force and it is estimated that Germany might need 15 to 20 divisions to overrun Southern Scandinavia would not be a simple project for the enemyfrom the administrative point of view alone.64.- An important factor in any German operation in Southern Swedenwould be the train ferry between Sas Nitz and Tralleborg. Most of the Swedishrailways are electrified, and. if power plants were destroyed, the Germans wouldhave to operate steam locomotives imported from Germany. Interference withthis ferry service would certainly tend, therefore, to slow up a German advanceinland.65. Any estimate of the time which it would take the Germans to obtaincontrol of Southern Sweden must necessarily be extremely speculative. On theassumption, however, that we had taken the initiative either in Northern orSouthern Scandinavia and the Germans were surprised, a possible time tablewould be : (a) Preparation   of   expedition,   sailing   and   unopposedlanding operations        ...       ...       ...(b) Advance from Southern Sweden to the line of theLakes, 200 miles (little opposition)   ...Halt for maintenance, say,Advance 150 miles over more difficult country tothe Grangesberg ai^ea (little opposition) say.or(c) If the landing took place near Stockholm, the advance to the Grangesberg area might be effected inMaintenance of Allied Forces.66. The following railways would be available, apart from interference bythe German air force which we consider below, for the maintenance of allied forces: (a) Trondheim-Ostersund-Orsa-Kristinehamn (on Lake Vannern).The capacity of this line is 6 trains of 300 tons each per day,which would suffice for between 4 and 6 divisions.(b) Trondheim by the Osterdalen route -to Kongsvinger-Karlstad (on Laker Vannern).(c) Aandalsneo via the Gudbrandsdal route-to Oslo and Karlstad.(d) Bergen-Oslo-Karlstad.^ If these lines could be maintained in the face of German air attack they&quot;Would, administratively, be capable of supporting substantial Allied Fojrces actingfin,support of the Swedish Army. ;    &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;-   &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Size and. availability of military forces required.67. Any calculation of the size of the Allied forces which would be requiredin Southern Sweden can only be approximate in the absence of all knowledge ofOne month.15-20 days.7 days.20 days.20 days.
the plans of the Swedish General Staff. If Sweden asked for. or accepted an offer of Allied military support, staff conversations would obviously be necessary forthe drawing up of a concerted plan of defence.68. The line of the Lakes which, apart from the actual coastline, is the bestdefensive position in Southern Sweden, consists of difficult, wooded country; andthe front tobe defended is, apart froin-\yLalejr^iiJJdcm.riQr ^ 50 miles in length.The Germans could not use large mechanised forces, and medium and heldartillery would have limited scope. The woods would give cover to troops in thefield, and anti-aircraft resources could be largely concentrated on the lines ofcommunication and at the base and railheads. On the other hand, the closenature of the country would call for relatively large numbers of infantrymen.At a rough estimate the position might be held by some 8 to 10 divisions.69. It would clearly be most desirable, if staff conversations took place, to persuade the Swedes to concentrate all the forces they could in the south, while leaving the main defence of the northern portion of their country to us. By doing so. they would simplify our maintenance problem greatly. It is unlikely, how-ever, that they could concentrate more than four divisions in the south, and somefour to six Allied divisions might, therefore, be necessary. These could be madeavailable only at the cost of the front in France.70. Cover for the transport of the expedition and its subsequent maintenancevia Trondheim could be provided by the Home Fleet. Additional forcesamounting to two or three flotillas of destroyers would be required for escort duties, and provision would also have to be made for local defences at Trondheim.A aerodromes.71. There are ten aerodromes in Southern Sweden from which modernaircraft could operate. In addition, there are two aerodromes in Norway nearOslo. Only five of the former are north of the line of the Lakes. There are alsoa number of small landing grounds.German air threat.72. The whole of Southern Sweden and Norway is within effective bombingrange of a large proportion of the German air striking force operating frombases in Germany. Trondheim is within the extreme range of the force, butGerman striking power would be much reduced. We must, however, expect aconsiderable threat to this base and to the railways leading inland from it. this threat would become more severe, and might ultimatelv-imperil the-S&amp;cmitv .of-the communications of pur forces in^^SqutEern Sweden, if the Germans succeeded in establishing air bases in Southern Sweden.This applies even more strongly to the air threat which would develop if germany secured the aerodromes in Southern Norway referred to below. Wemust also anticipate that Germany may move into Denmark in order to secure theuse of aerodromes in that country. Only two, in Northern Denmark, would,however, be of value to her, and the additional threat from these bases would be acceptable.Role of British air force,73. Provided that our forces could reach Southern Sweden before a german invasion, it might be possible for us to operate a total of about twelve Squadrons.Six of these squadrons might be bombers, three fighters, and three army co-operation. In this event, British bomber squadrons, operatingintensively from Swedish aerodromes, could probably cause considerabledislocation to any German landing operations, but the period for whichthey could maintain their attack would depend largely on the extent towhich the Germans had developed their fighter resources and the degree olsecurity we had achieved at our own air bases in Sweden.   If the Germans
succeeded iu establishing one or more air bases on Swedish soil, the maintenanceof the British air effort would become increasingly difficult. In the event of a withdrawal, it would be essential to render Swedish landing grounds and aerodromes unusable.If we did not succeed in obtaining a footing in the extreme south of Swedenbefore the Germans, our air support would be restricted by lack of aerodromesto about seven squadrons.German air targets.74. Apart from troops in the field, which should not offer much target,German air bombardment would probably be concentrated on the destruction ofour aircraft and equipment on aerodromes and the railways maintaining onemilitary and air forces in Sweden. The former would be a serious threat owingto the limited number of aerodromes and the impossibility of dispersion.There are four main lines from Trondheim and one from Bergen, throughOslo. Moreover, there is a net-work of lines in Southern Sweden, and repairgangs and material should be readily available. The Bergen line, which is the closest to Germany, might, however, be seriously interrupted, and this fact,combined with the greater vulnerability of Bergen itself in comparison withTrondheim, would make it inadvisable to use the former as a main base.Conclusion on air operations.75. There can be no doubt that the German air threat to Sweden is great,and that we could do little to reduce it. On the other hand, we consider it a fan-risk to operate Allied military forces on the scale envisaged, based on Trondheimand other Norwegian ports, though it may well become difficult to maintain those forces in their forward positions if the Germans have succeeded in establishingair forces in Southern Norway and Sweden.Air support for such an expedition could, however, only be provided at theexpense of our Metropolitan Air Force. The allocation of fighter squadrons for operations in Sweden would be a particularly serious commitment, and we could,in fact, not afford more than a token protection to the land forces.Summary and conclusions regarding Southern Sweden.76. Our conclusions regarding operations in Southern Sweden are asfollows :  *-(a) The value of the Grangesberg field does not, by itself, warrant a majorAllied effort to prevent the export of ore through Southern Balticports to Germany.(b) The most economical method of stopping the export of Grangesberg&apos; oreto Germany would be to destroy the mechanical loading apparatus at,and block the harbour entrance to. Oxelosund. Purely naval actionto achieve the latter purpose is not practicable.(c) The Swedish forces are not strong enough to prevent a German occupationof Sweden.(d) We may be faced with a request for substantial Allied forces to operate.in Southern Sweden as a quid pro quo for Swedish co-operation.(e) The defence of Southern Sweden is also desirable in order to obtainstrategic cover to our operations in the north.(/) Effective resistance to a German invasion would probably call for somefour to six Allied divisions in addition to the Swedish army. Ifshipping was available, communications in Norway and Sweden wouMbe able to maintain a lightly equipped allied force of this size. Therewould, hoAvever, be an additional naval commitment amounting to twoor three flotillas of destroyers.(g) A maximum of six bomber, three fighter and three Army Co-operationsquadrons might be operated from Southern Scandinavia, Such a force would be greatly inferior to the likely scale of attack by enemy aircraft operating from bases in Germany.
(h) The German air threat is not so great as to render the despatch of an expedition in Southern Sweden unjustifiable, but might be such as to preclude the possibility of maintaining substantial, forces in a forwardposition -Tor&apos;mb?^ ha^&quot;^imf edli3me.(i) British bomber squadrons operating from Norwegian and Swedish basesmight impede German landing operations.(c) Operations in Southern Norway.77. It is to be expected that the Germans would wish to turn the loss of norwegian neutrality to their own advantage by establishing naval and air bases in Southern Norway. There are good aerodromes at Oslo. christians and,Stavanger, and smaller ones at Bergen and Trondheim. The last four places arealso suitable for use as advanced naval bases. Seaplane bases also exist in theselocalities, and facilities for operating seaplanes could be quickly improvised atmany other points on the Norwegian coast.Noriveg ian resistance.78. In view of the weakness of the Norwegian army, air force and anti-aircraft defences, the initial German forces might be flown in, and. since we couldnot effectively interrupt sea communications through the Kattegat to Oslo, furtherforces could speedily follow. There is little prospect of the Norwegians, with atotal army amounting to only two scattered divisions, being able to offer muchsubsequent resistance. This would be even more true if the Germans, havingpreviously invaded Southern Sweden, extended their operations over the borderinto Norway, and so avoided the necessity of relying on sea communications outsidethe Baltic.Strategic advantages to Germany of occupying bases in Norway.79. Should the Germans succeed in establishing themselves in southern norway, they would be well placed to : (a) intensify their attack on our naval forces controlling the northern exitfrom&quot; the North Sea and against our naval bases. Scapa and the shetlands are only 250 miles from Stavanger, as compared with nearly500 miles from Germany.(b) keep part of our Northern Patrol under air observation and thusfacilitate surface attack on those forces.(c) intensify their submarine warfare by refuelling and refreshing U-boatsreturning from patrol, thus saving the additional voyage to and fromGermany.(d) dispute the control of any minefields we might lay in Norwegian waters.and even to maintain a swept channel through the minefield for merchant shipping.(e) intensify their attack on our convoys from Norway.(/) bring any communications we had established via Trcndheim under a greatly increased scale of air attack.80. German aircraft operating from Norwegian aerodromes would be themost serious air threat. This threat might be reduced for about six months byextensive damage to the aerodromes. This the Norwegians might be induced toundertake themselves, but the only certain way of ensuring the necessary damagewould be to do it ourselves.As regards potential naval bases, we could not ensure their denial to theenemy without seizing and holding them ourselves.Necessity for, and method of, forestalling the enemy.81. Once the Germans were established it would require a major operation to dislodge them. HenceJLjyxail^J^essential to foresjill them. Small forces,augmented by strong detachments of engin^rsJ&quot;sEouTo! be able to ensure extensive damage to the existing aerodromes, and the communications leading towards them, on the landward side.
82. Given Norwegian collaboration, and provided we were able to forestallthe Germans, it should be possible to land, and maintain small forces by sea, atTrondheim, Bergen and Stavanger. Once established, our control of sea com-munications should be sufficient to prevent any sustained seaborne attack on them,but they would have to be sufficiently strong to deal with airborne orseaborne raids.A small force could probably be conveyed by sea to christians and also, butthe exposed position of that place would probably render its subsequent main-tenance by sea too difficult. We think, however, that it could be maintainedoverland from a base further north.Oslo is a different proposition. A small force could not be taken there by sea, although it might be flown in. The operation is an important one for studyby our Service staffs. As Oslo is the capital, it is to be hoped that it would be adequately defended by the Norwegians, and it is possible that they could be relied on to prevent the two existing aerodromes from falling into German hands.83. The role of any forces landed in Norway would be to delay, by guerrillatactics, a German land advance to capture the bases concerned, and to defeat anyattempts at airborne attack. It is estimated that the very difficult nature of thecountry would force the enemy to employ considerably stronger forces in order toensure success, quite apart from any opposition which the Norwegians or Swedesknight offer.If, on the approach of superior enemy forces, a. withdrawal from Trondheim.Bergen. Stavanger or christians and became necessary, the personnel could be withdrawn by sea; and we should hope that they would have effected demolitionswhich would take the Germans several months to make good. Withdrawal of a force from Oslo could only be effected overland to a more northern base, but thisshould not be impossible for a small force in a friendly country.84. The occupation of these bases, coupled with the use of naval light craft,submarines and aircraft (seaplanes being used if necessary), should suffice toprevent the Germans establishing themselves at intermediate points on the westcoast of Norway.Conclusion on operations in Southern Norway.85. Our conclusions regarding operations in Southern Norway are asfollows : (a) Our intervention in Northern Scandinavia is very likely to provoke aGerman attack on Southern Norway. The object of that attack wouldbe to obtain air and naval bases from which to dispute our position inthe North Sea and northern waters, and to harry airy line of communi-cation we had established on Norwegian or Swedish soil.(b) In view of our existing guarantee to Norw^ay, we consider it desirablethat we should take what action we can to help her; but(c) In our own interests, we consider it essential that the Germans should, ifpossible, be denied bases on the Norwegian coast. The establishmentof such German bases would not only gravely compromise our navalcontrol, but also the security of any base we established at Trondheim.SECTION V.THE BROAD  STRATEGIC PICTURE.86. So far we have confined our examination to the local implications of apolicy aimed at stopping the export of iron ore to Germany. The propositionmust, however, be considered in its broader aspects and in relation to the strategicconduct of the war.   Setting aside the possibility of any radical change in the
existing political situation, we consider it sufficient if we examine the implications of this policy in so far as it is likely to affect (a) Germany the major enemy.(b) Russia the potential enemy.(c) Allied strategy.Germany.87. Hitherto Germany has been content to stand on the defensive in theWest, consolidate her position in the East and direct her attack on Britishseaborne trade, and it may be that the next few months will see little change in thispolicy. If, however, the facts regarding the economic effect of cutting off her supplies of Swedish iron ore are correct, we must assume that they are appreciatedby the German General Staff and that the situation in Northern Europe will exercise a considerable, if not overriding, influence on German strategy. Clearlyit would be in the German interest to keep the war out of Scandinavia, and con-tinue to draw her supply of ore without interruption if this could be done.German diplomacy will therefore be directed to this end, and the threat of theGerman air force may well deter the Scandinavians from co-operating with us.88 If. however, we are able to obtain Scandinavian co-operation, germany will be forced to adopt one, or both, of the following courses :  (a) invading Sweden to regain control of the ore;(b) attempting to bring the war to a speedy conclusion before her existingreserves of armaments are exhausted.If Germany invaded Scandinavia, her commitment might be of the order of20 divisions. We estimate that, in these circumstances, and after allowing forthe defence of Poland and the internal security of occupied territory, she wouldbe able to dispose of some 110 infantry divisions on the Western Front.Alternatively, if she did not go into Scandinavia, she might have 130 divisions in the West. Against this the Allies would be able to dispose of 94 divisions inFrance, excluding our own forces in Scandinavia, and we feel that Germany&apos;smargin of superiority would be insufficient to enable her to achieve success by aland offensive in the West.89. Another possible course of German action would be to penetrate intoSouth-Eastern Europe. Apart from any action Russia might take to stop, orassist, Germany, there is little the Allies could do to prevent the latter reaching the Turkish Frontier and the iEgean. An advance into the Balkans might involve the employment of up to 60 or 70 German divisions; and there is nodoubt that the Germans could dispose of sufficient forces to make these troops available and also to ensure the defence of their Western Frontier and thesecurity of Poland. But the disadvantages to Germany of this course would bethe steady drain on her armament reserves, the danger that Italian hostilitymight be provoked, and, above all, the fact that her advance would not speedilybring the war to a conclusion.90. Again, the Germans might well feel that they could obtain a quicksuccess by intensifying their attack on our naval forces and seaborne trade,coupled perhaps with a major air offensive on this country or on France. Thereis no doubt that they could do this, since these two forms of action would not useup armaments on a scale comparable with a major land1 offensive. germany might calculate that we should be unable to maintain our position on account of increased shipping losses for a sufficient period to bring her to the point of surrender through the stoppage of her iron ore from Sweden.91. We cannot predict which of the above courses Germany will adopt, but, \if the estimate of the importance of the Swedish iron ore on which this paper is Ibased is correct, we feel that Germany may be forced to resort to any desperate/means to gain a quick decision.Russia.92. As we have already said, we may, as a result of action in Scandinavia,become involved in war with Russia. It is important, therefore, to consider what,the effect of such hostilities would be.
The War Cabinet will recall that we have hitherto consistently advisedagainst a declaration of war against Russia. We have pointed out* that war withRussia would add to our commitments in the following way : (a) Russian propaganda, particularly in the Middle East, where it is animmediate menace to our interests, would be intensified.(b) German-Russian economic co-operation would slow up the effect of our economic pressure on Germany.(c) By penetration into Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. Russia could cause us the most serious embarrassment. If Italy were hostile; this would present a problem almost insoluble with our present resources in theMiddle East. Even with Italy neutral, the position would be mostserious.(d) Submarine warfare would probably be intensified in Home Waters.More determined action -by German surface vessels wrould have to beexpected and the availability of the ice-free port of Murmansk wouldbroaden the base of the enemy&apos;s operations. A minor threat to british trade might develop in the Pacific.(e) Partly because of the slowing up of our economic pressure, and partly asa result of the dispersion of our strength in secondary theatres, thedate when the Allies could pass to the offensive on land and in the airwould be postponed.. In connection with (a) and (b) above, however, we now consider that Russianpropaganda against Britain cannot be greatly intensified beyond its present point,whilst any economic benefits to Germany arising from the Russo-German alliancewill be reduced to vanishing-point if Russia becomes involved in war with theAllies in addition to her commitments in Finland.93. Against the above disadvantages it wull be remembered that we madethe following important qualifications! :  &quot; The question (?*.*?.., of whether or not we should declare war on Russia)seems thus to resolve itself into whether any advantage which might accrue from the support of neutrals, consequent.upon a stand by us against russian aggression, will outweigh the disadvantage which we should incur by the undoubted increase in our military commitments and by the probability thatwe should weld Germany and Russia more firmly together.The key to the neutral situation is the United States of America. Thereis no doubt that the open support of the United States would decide theattitude of Japan and probably that of Italy and Spain. The resultingaccretion to our military strength would far outweigh the additional commit-ments we should undertake in going to war with Russia.&quot;94. Since the above reports were written, however, Russia has undertakena campaign against Finland and we must reconsider the matter in a new light.The Russians have already deployed some twenty odd divisions in Finland. as their attack has so far failed to achieve its object, we assume that Russian prestigewill demand its resumption, although this may not take place until April or May.In this event the Russian commitment is likely to be increased and, if an attempt is to be made to extend Russian influence into Scandinavia, we estimate that theRussians may have to employ still more divisions forward of Leningrad. Theimmediate problem to be decided, therefore, is whether Russia&apos;s threat to our interests elsewhere in the world will be diminished, if she becomes committed in scandinavia. (We attach at Appendix A a note on the extent of the Russianthreat to Scandinavia.)The effect of Russian hostility at sea.95. The campaign in Finland is not likely to have any effect upon theRussian war effort at sea. As before, the main threat lies in the increased activity of submarines, which may extend to the Mediterranean and to the Far East. Itwould be difficult to meet the additional demands for anti-submarine warfare inthese circumstances, even when ships now building have been taken into service.* W.P. (39) 74, dated 8th October, 1939.f W.P. (39) 105, dated 31st October, 1939.
The effect of Russian hostility on land and in the air.96. Broadly speaking, Russian land formations west of Lake Baikal are disposed as follows : *Russian air forces west of Lake Baikal are believed to number about 3,000, alltold. Of these 500 are said to be engaged in operations in Finland, and smallcontingents are located in the Military Districts in the Middle East, These figuresappear formidable, but the inefficiency of the Russian fighting machine has alreadybeen clearly demonstrated in Finland. Too great importance should therefore not be attached to them.97. It is difficult to state categorically whether or not any of these forces are sufficiently self-contained in their own areas to enable them to undertakeoperations at the same time as a campaign is conducted against Finland. Itseems reasonable to suppose, however, that they have sufficient reserves of men andmaterial to allow of local operations for a limited time.98. It is quite clear, however, that the prosecution of a campaign inNorthern Europe in which a large force was employed would be a tremendousstrain upon Russia&apos;s industry, reserves of stocks and transportation system.Any additional operations in other theatres would increase this strain as soonas local resources were exhausted, and we believe that this would lead to an earlycollapse of the Russian machine.99.   We sum up the situation as follows :  (a) We think it likely that Russia will persist in her attempt to conquerFinland and that she may thus become involved in a large commitment in Northern Europe.(b) Such a commitment is likely to diminish her ability to threaten Britishinterests in the Middle East.(c) We believe that if we went to war with Russia, our action would be welcomed by the majority of neutral States throughout the world,as being evidence of our determination to make a firm stand againstunwarranted aggression.(d) We recognise that war with Russia may throw an additional, but notinsupportable, burden upon our control of sea communications.(e) On balance it appears that the disadvantages of open hostilities withRussia should be accepted in preference to losing the chance, and perhaps the only chance, of achieving the early defeat of Germany.Allied strategy.100. Finally, we turn to consider the broad implications of this proposedScandinavian policy, in so far as Allied strategy is concerned.The overriding consideration in taking a decision to seize and hold theGalivare orefields is the assumption that this action would decide the outcome of the war, and within measurable time. In addition, such a course of action would turn to full account our control of sea communications, and it shouldachieve a valuable diversionary effect. By employing some five o&apos;- six allied divisions in Scandinavia, we may expect to compel Germany to divert perhapstwenty divisions to that area, with all the hazards of an opposed combined operation. Such a diversion would more than counterbalance the reduction ofAllied strength in France.Divisions.Poland  ...     &quot;...Roumanian frontierCaucasian frontierIranian frontierCentral Russia ...Northern Europe (Finland)some20253015738-50
101. On the other hand, the possibility of embarking on military operations in Scandinavia is dependent on a prior assurance of Norwegian and Swedishco-operation, and we must be prepared for the consequences of becoming involvedin war with Russia, and for the possibility of having to meet her threats indistant theatres. An additional strain would be imposed on Allied shipping;,the situation of which is already causing anxiety, but this would not be anoverriding consideration if decisive results could be obtained.SECTION YI.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.Summary.102.   To sum up : (i) On the assumption that the complete stoppage of Swedish iron oresupplies to Germany will be decisive, our aim is to gain control overa sufficient volume of Swedish iron ore exports and to retain that control long enough to bring Germany to the point of surrender(paragraph 3).(ii) To achieve this we must stop the export of ore from the northern field for at least one year. If we can do so at small cost to ourselves, weshould also try to stop the export from the southern field(paragraphs -^12).(iii) The only method of- stopping the export from the northern fields is bythe despatch of an expedition. This will involve the despatch of a force of from one to two brigades, specially equipped and trained, toreach its objective by the end of March. The possibility of having to increase this force substantially at a later date must&apos; be recognised(paragraphs 21-53).(iv) It is not considered worth while to send any forces to stop the exportof ore from the southern field, since that could be effected more economically by blocking and demolitions at the^port of Oxelosund(paragraph 76).(v) Both Norwegian and Swedish co-operation is essential to the success ofa military operation in Scandinavia (paragraphs 13-16).(vi) To obtain this essential co-operation we may be called upon to send a force to support the Swedes and the Norwegians against german attack. This would involve the employment of a substantial Alliedland force. It is considered administratively feasible to maintain sucha force based on Trondheirn. Its role might be to co-operate with theSwedish army in holding the line of the &quot; Lakes &quot; (paragraphs 54-76).(vii) As a result of any action we may take in Scandinavia, the Germans mayoccupy southern Norway. The seizure of naval and air bases in southern Norway by Germany would constitute a serious threat to our control of sea communications in the North Sea and northern waters,and would seriously prejudice our chance of using Trondheim as abase port. In order to assure the success of the operations, therefore,we must deny the use of these bases to the Germans (para-graphs 77-85).&apos;(viii) It is thus clear that the three operations in Northern Scandinavia.Southern Norway and Southern Sweden are complementary, and it is vital to the success of the project that we should be prepared to carryout all three concurrently,(ix) The protection of the sea communications would introduce an extranaval commitment, which might absorb the services of at least twoflotillas of destroyers and local defence forces for the base ports(paragraph 31).
,.     (x) The provision of the necessary shipping will inevitably accentuate theexisting shortage (paragraph 19).(xi) To support these operations we may have to provide one fighter squadron and one army co-operation squadron on the Northern Line, and up to twelve squadrons in Southern Sweden. The German air threat on theNorthern Line may seriously interrupt the communications of our forces, but we think this threat can be accepted. We can accept theenemy air threat to Southern Scandinavia from aerodromes inGermany alone, but the communications of our forces in this area may become precarious if Germany7 establishes air bases in southern norway or Sweden (paragraphs 47 and 73-76).German Reactions.(xii) Our action may compel Germany to adopt one or both of the followingcourses (paragraph 88) :  (a) Invading Sweden to regain control of the ore.(b) Attempting to bring the war to a speedy conclusion before herexisting reserves of armaments ai&apos;e exhausted.(xiii) German intervention in Scandinavia would cause a dispersion of hereffort, which would finally rule out the possibility of a successfulGerman offensive on land in the West. Penetration into South-east europe would not effect a speedy decision (paragraphs 88-89).(xiv) A likely: course of German action will, therefore, be an immediate air offensive on this country and a ruthless intensification of attack on oursea-borne trade (paragraph 90).(xv) Intervention in Scandinavia may7 result in hostilities with Russia. the risks involved, however, are small compared with the opportunitynow offered of achieving the early  defeat of Germany (para-graphs 92-99).Conclusion.103. It must be realised that to embark on an offensive in Scandinavia inthe Spring of 1940 represents a fundamental change in our policy7. Up to datethat policy has been to remain on the defensive on land and in the air.while our armaments are increased. The plan under review, however, wouldenable us to initiate, in March, offensive operations which might well provedecisive. The opportunity is a great one and we see no prospect of an equalchance being afforded us elsewhere. We consider that the strategy of operating in Scandinavia is sound, provided vital Allied points elsewhere are secure. Thosepoints are the front in France, which we think can be held, and Great Britainand our sea-borne trade. The consequences of a major air offensive against GreatBritain cannot be predicted with any7 more certainty7 now than when our existing policy was adopted, and our air defences are still far short of oar requirements.The policy under review, therefore, must involve some risk. Nevertheless, in viewof the possibility7 of obtaining decisive results we think this risk can be accepted.104. We accordingly recommend the adoption of a policy aimed at stopping the export of all Swedish iron ore to Germany, provided that Scandinavianco-operation is first obtained.105. There is a final consideration, which is not strictly7 within our terms ofreference, but which we think the War Cabinet should have before them.This report is based on the assumption that we hold the initiative. More-over, we assume that it would suit the German book that we should not take actionin Scandinavia and that the status quo should be maintained.If, however, Germany7 became suspicious that we intended to act, they might attempt to forestall us. Our hand would then be forced and it would be a raceagainst time.The only course open to us would be to hamper and delay the German invasion of Scandinavia by submarine forces operating in the Baltic and by landing asmall, hastily improvised, force at Narvik with the object of picketing the Narvikrailway, seizing the aerodrome at Boden, and destroying the port facilities atLulea.
This force would not be trained and equipped for active operations inNorthern Scandinavia in winter, but it should be capable of the above limitedtasks until reinforced by an adequately equipped and properly preparedexpedition.(Signed) C.

EXTENT OF  THE  RUSSIAN  THREAT  TO  SCANDINAVIA.1. Except for the limited threat of air attack by Russian long range bombersbased on Russian territory, a Russian attack upon Northern Scandinavia canonly be carried out across Finnish territory and after the defeat of theFinnish army.2. At present the Russian advance is held up and it may not be resumeduntil April or May. Once it starts, however, the defeat of Finland can only bea matter of time.3. When the defeat of Finland has been achieved, the Russians should bein a position to organise two or three divisions in the Kemijarvi-Rovianiemiarea, capable of carrying out effective raids over the Swedish borders.4. Later, and after the Finnish railways had been reorganised, the Russianscould maintain a force of at least six divisions in the Haparanda area. Their first objective in Sweden would probably be Lulea,APPENDIX B.SWEDISH FORCES.Naval.Coast defence shipsAircraft cruiserCruiserDestroyersTorpedo boatsMotor torpedo boatsSubmarinesMinelayer ...Vedette boatsMinor Vessels.MinesweepersDepot ships ...Oiler ...Vedette boatsTraining shipsSurvey vesselsIce-breakers ...81114182161421118452(Five over 30 years old)(11 aircraft)(Eight 5-9-inch guns)(Eight over 20 years old)(All 30 years old)(Built 1924)(All post-1920-6 modern)(Built 1914)(Can be used as minelayers, mine-sweepers or for A/S work)Note.
