COPY NO.   2 VV/AR CABINET.THE SITUATION IN SCANDINAVIA:    PROPOSEDCOMMUNICATION TO THE NORVfiSGIAN AND swedish governments -Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a record ofa conversation between the French Ambassador and thePermanent Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsabout the proposed communication to the norwegian and Swedish Governments on the subject of help for Finland.(Intld.)    H.

The French Ambassador called this evening and I toldHis   Excellency that as a result of the Cabinet discussionthis morning we were sending a telegram to Paris (No. 455of 22nd December) instructing His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador toinform the French Government that we agreed to a representa-tion to the Norwegian and Swedish Governments on the lines which they had suggested (W.P.(39) 170).      I said that wewere only proposing a few verbal modifications.I said that the Cabinet had examined the whole ofthis question at some length this morning and they had been impressed with the importance of the region of the swedish iron ore deposits.     Monsieur Daladier himself at our recent meeting in Paris had laid great stress on this.It was impossible to know what the exact Soviet objective was, whether it was simply to achieve the conquest off inland, or whether they aimed further afield and had their eye on this mining region.       If the latter, thatwould certainly raise a very important problem.The Chiefs of Staff were now making a further study   -of the assistance that might be given to the Scandinavian   -countries to resist a Soviet aggression upon them, and asa, result of that study we might be able to form anestimate of the possibility of helping them successfullyto resist such an aggression.Monsieur Corbin asked whether it would not benecessary for that to have the consent and co-operationof the Norwegian and Swedish Governments, to which I said that of course that would be desirable.

22nd December. 1959.\\I told Monsieur Corbin that directly we heard thathis Government accepted the minor modifications which we proposed we should be ready to make the communication tothe Norwegian and Swedish Governments.       I was not sure whether we should do it through our Ministers in Osloand Stockholm or whether the Secretary of State might wish to hand the communication to the Norwegian and swedish Ministers in London in order that he might beable to give them explanations or reply to any questions that they might put.(Signed)    ALEXANDER CADOGAN.
