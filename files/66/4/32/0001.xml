-WEEKLY REPORT NO.17 ON AIR OPERATIONS and intelligence FOR THE WEEK ENDING MIDNIGHT SUNDAY.DECEMBER 31st. 1939 0BOMBER COMMAND.1.        The week was,&apos;--on the whole,-a quiet-one forBomber Command.   No major operations took place, and air activity in general was to a certain extent limited by adverse weather conditions..   There were, however, a number of valuablereconnaissance flights.2. In consequence of reports which indicated that theenemy might attempt a naval sortie over the Christmas period,extensive sweeps were carried out by aircraft of Bomber command and Coastal Command on December 24th, 25th and 26th.    no enemy surface craft were sighted, and although there were twosubmarine sightings no attack could be carried out as theywere found in an area in which Bomber Command are forbidden toattack submarines.    A reconnaissance by two single Blenheimaircraft was carried out over Wilhelmshaven on 27th December to search for heavy units of the enemy fleet0    Two destroyers were observed at Wilhelmshaven and one submarine and one destroyer inthe Schillig Roads, while on the return journey a number of mine sweepers were seen north of Juisto    On 29th Decembertwelve Blenheim aircraft carried out a reconnaissance over thecentral North Sea area, while four Whitley aircraft covered the area off the Horns Reef.    No enemy vessels were sighted.3. A further reconnaissance was carried out by bomber command- over Norderney and Borkum on 31st December to ascertainif the enemy seaplane bases In this area had been provided with balloon barrage defences.    No balloons were seen and only slight anti-aircraft fire was encountered.4., Night operations over enemy seaplane bases in the heligoland Bight were restricted during the week by badvisibility in the neighbourhood of the bases in question.   The/patrols

patrols were resumed on the night of 31st December by Whitleyaircraft of No,5 Group.    The crew of one aircraft reported aflare path in the neighbourhood of the inland of Neuwerk, thelights being extinguished when a bomb was dropped in thevicinity.    Slight anti-aircraft fire was encountered overWangeroog.FIGHTER COMMAND.5. The week was marked mainly by the absence of enemy activity and was one of the quietest since the outbreakof the war.    There were, however, considerable additions tothe ordinary series of routine patrols and in all eighty-seven patrols, involving two hundred and fifty-seven aircraft were flown.    Fighter protection was given to leave boatspassing between France and England on three occasions inco-operation with Coastal Command and with aircraft, of theAir Component, British Expeditionary Force; and the trawlerpatrol over the Lowestoft fishing grounds was regularlymaintained when the weather was such as to give any opportunity for enemy activity,,    One- enemy aircraft wassighted by this patrol on the 27th December flying very high,hut succeeded in making good its escape.    There have been no attacks on trawlers since this patrol was institutedon 20th December.6. The only other raid identified as hostile was --over the Channel on the 29th December,,    This aircraft, whichwas flying at over 20,000 feet., was eventually engagedby fighters of the Air Component, British Expeditionary Force.COASTAL COMMAND-78 One hundred and twenty-two patrols were flowninvolving two hundred and twenty-eight aircraft; and in additionthirty-three convoys were provided with escort involvingninety-eight aircraft./On.

8. On Christmas Day, and again on 27th December, sharpopposition was encountered from German vessels heavily armed with anti-aircraft guns, and bombs were dropped on three occasions.    The only certain hit was registered with a250-lb. bomb on the stern of a patrol vessel on 27th December.The vessel was not seen to sink but appeared to be seriously damaged.9. A continuous escort of Hudson aircraft was provided for the damaged submarine &quot;Triumph&quot; which returnedto the Firth of Forth safely on December 28th0    A Dornierflying boat which approached the submarine was driven off bythe escorting aircraft.10. Three Dornier 18&apos;s which were probably also insearch of the submarine were encountered on 27th December; firewas exchanged and our pilots carried out a dive bombing attackon the enemy aircraft.    No definite success was claimed onbehalf of our aircraft at the time, but it has become known that three German airmen were picked up in the North Sea bya neutral vessel not long after; they reported the fourthmember of their crew had been killed by British fire.11. No submarines were sighted during theweekalthough certain suspicious indications were observed duringthe anti-submarine escort provided for the leave boat on31st December and bombs were dropped,,    Numerous mines were seen and their position reported but attempts to explodethem by machine gun fire were generally   unsuccessful.AIR COMPONENT OF THE BRITISH EXPEDITIONARY FORCE.12. The usual reconnaissance flights and patrols were maintained in spite of adverse weather conditions and on the29th December a.Heinkel 111 was intercepted and attacked overthe Channel but succeeded in evading pursuit among the clouds./OVERSEAS COMMANDS.

4oOVERSEAS COMMANDS.13. In the Mediterranean three anti-submarine patrols were flown and escort was provided for four convoys.      The AirForces in India provided five reconnaissances.      Reports from palestine continue to shew an improvement in the situation;only two sorties were required during the week and air action was taken against one village.AIR INTELLIGENCE.GERMAN AIR ACTIVITY.14. The German Air Force has been comparatively inactive,even in training flights,  during the past week, possibly becauseheavy snowfall has made many aerodromes temporarily unserviceable,particularly in Eastern Germany,.      There have been some of theusual meteorological reconnaissances over the North Sea and therewas considerable activity over French territory on 29th December.15. The only major operation was an attempt on 27thDecember to locate and bomb H.M,  submarine &quot;Triumph&quot; thenreturning damaged to port under escort provided by coastal command.      A formation of at least ten bombers, left Germany insearch of the submarine,  in response to the signal of a reconnaissance plane? but failed to locate their target and returned.16. Further    data have been collected in regard to the positions and armament of Flak ships in the Heligoland Bight.FRENCH AIR ACTIVITY,17. The French Air Force has not been very active duringthe period December 25th to December 31st,  and this was due,  toa great extent,  to adverse weather conditions.18. Apart from photographic missions on 29th and 31stDecember, no reconnaissances wore made by the French Air forces and the French fightei- squadrons made only forty-eight sorties.There were no contacts with the enemyc/THE RUSSO-FINNISH WAR.

5r 3 iTHE RUSSQ-FIMJISH WAR.19. The Finnish air losses are now estimated at;-1 Ripon (Coastal Reconnaissance)1 Fokker (Fighter)7 Bulldogs (Fighters).5 Blenheims (Bombers)These losses are higher than any that have hitherto beenreported, but it will be noted that with the exception of theBlenheims the planes concerned are of obsolete types.20. As the War Cabinet are aware,  approval has beengiven for the release of a number of British military aircraft to Finland.      The numbers and types of these aircraft (whichare being supplied, ostensibly by the aircraft firms concerned)are as follows:-20 fighters (Gladiators)10 fighters (Gladiators) *28 obsolescent fighters (Gauntlets) *12 bombers (Blenheims)* These aircraft are a free gift to the finnish government who are responsible for the cost of freight and packing only:In addition,  a considerable amount of small arms ammunition is being released,  and a request for bombs is underconsideration.The Blenheim bombers are to be flown to Finland byFinnish pilots, some of whom have already arrived in thiscountry.      The Swedish Government is affording assistance withregard to the fighter aircraft by allowing them to be erected in sweden with the help of some British mechanics who are being sent out by the aircraft firm.21. Russian air activity has been considerable- in spiteof weather conditions.      In addition to the usual activity over/the

the Mannerheim line there have been raids on Helsinki, including a leaflet raid by twelve aircraft on 27th December, and anattack by eight aircraft on the same day on the Headquarters ofthe Finnish Northern Army at Rovaniemi.,     There have also beenorepeated attacks on Hango, Abo, Tammerfors and other important points.     More damage appears to have been done to the civilian population than to military objectives,  and Russian losses havebeen substantial.     Wo precise figuref-r: are available beyond thoseof thirty-six bombers and one fighter given last week:    but seven aircraft are reported to have come down in Finnish territory on27th December through lack of petrol.-     There are persistentrumours of shortage of aviation spirit in Russia,
