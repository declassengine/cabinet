TO BE  KEPT UNDER LOCK  AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to 182ensure the secrecv of this document.C R B T.P. (39) 175. COPY NO.Also Paper No.&quot; 0.S.(59)&quot;l74.)WAR CABINET.SCANDINAVIA.(Previous Paper No:    W.P.(39)  175).Report by the Chiefs of Staff committee.The War Cabinet at their Meeting on the22nd December: -&quot;(i) Approved the Memorandum of Instructionsset out in W.P,(39)  170 as to the communication to be made by the Frenchand British Governments to theNorwegian and Swedish Governments onthe subject of the assurance to begiven to the latter Governments ofFranco-British help against thepossible consequences to them of such assistance as they might afford to finland:(ii) Agreed that when the communicationreferred, to in (i) above was made tothe Governments of Norway and Sweden,they should be informed at the sametime that we intended to take certain measures to stop the supply of iron ore from Sweden to Germany:&quot;2. Before the approach to the Norwegian and swedish governments in accordance with Conclusion (i) above ismade, we invite the War Cabinet to re-examine Conclusion(ii), since we think, in the light of changed circumstances,that if we now told the Swedes and Norwegians that we intended to stop the supply of iron ore from Sweden toGermany, this information might have a most unfortunate effect on them for the following reason.3. Up till recently we had thought it likely that russia would soon over-run Finland and would subsequentlyinvade Northern Scandinavia.4- Wo.M&apos;. (-39) 122nd Conclusions, Minute 1.

4.       In these circumstances it was probable that the swedes and Norwegians would be willing to accept anyo fev of assistance fro:.\ us and,  in that event, weshould have an excuse to land a force at Narvik witha view to ensuring; that the Swedish ore mines did not fall into Russian, or ultimately German, hands.    Aslong as this happened before the Gulf of Bothniabecame ice free there seemed every chance of our being able to get control of the mines before the germans could do so.5.       All our recent information goes to show,, however,that the Finns are putting up a very stout resistance,and the possibility of Russian invasion of Scandinaviahas temporarily receded, and with it has gone for thepresent our excuse to send forces there.6.        It is probable that the Swedes are now lessapprehensive of a Russian invasion and would, on that account. be less susceptible to our advances forco-operation with them.    If; therefore,  at this juncture we tell them that we intend to take stepsto stop the supply of iron ore from Sweden to Germanytthere is a danger that the informa.tion will prove mostunpalatable to them and might have the effect ofswinging them back into the German orbit.    There isalso the danger that the information would immediatelyreach Germanyo7.        If the V/ar Cabinet were to decide that we shouldtake steps to cut off Germany&apos;s ore supplies and Swedenwas not with us, we should only be able to stop that very small proportion of the ore which goes by soa from narvik,,  since we should find it difficulty,  if not impossible,   to sabotage the railways and mines.    Thiswould not give us decisive results.3o       As the   :ar Cabinet are aware - we are examining the whole problem of Germany&apos;s Swedish ore supplies inall its aspects and our report will he available shortly.9.       &apos;7eB therefore, urge that when communicating tothe Swedish and Norwegian Governments our proposals forassistance to Finland, we should nots at this stage,mention the action which is now being considered to stopGermany&apos;s ore supplies.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.&quot; H.R.
