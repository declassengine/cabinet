E C RE T. COPY NOWEEKLY REPORT (NO, 15) OF AIR operations and INTELLIGENCE FOR THE WEEK ENDING MIDNIGHT17TH DECEMBER,   1939-Bomber Command...1.      Operations against the German Fleet.      On December 13tha British submarine operating in the North Sea reported that ithad sighted and attacked with torpedoes a force of German warshipsproceeding North at speed,      Later in the day a similar report was received from a vVhitley aircraft on its way to patrol enemyseaplane bases.2.      In consequer.ee of these reports?  a strong striking forceof heavy bombers stood by from dawn on the 14th December and inaddition all remaining squadrons of Bomber Command were placed at short notice.      Extensive reconnaissances were made both by coastal Command and by Bomber Commando      Between 8 a.m.  and 1 p.m.,two squadrons of Hamp dens carried out a reconnaissance in force,but encountered low clouds and bad visibility and found no target.Later in the morning,  a force of 12 Wellington aircraft was despatched to carry out a high level bombing attack on enemywarships in the Jade River, Schillig Roads, off Wilhemshaven,  or at sea.      Low cloud forced the aircraft to fly at low altitude,sometimes almost at sea level,     Plying at 800 ft.  this forceobserved one battleship,  one cruiser...  and three destroyers,approximately 12 miles south-west of Heligoland,  and at the sametime encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire and shortly afcerwardsenemy fighter opposition.      Intensive fighting developed, andlasted for 40 minutes,  against about 20 enemy fighters.      TheWellington aircraftj which maintained formation throughout, were successful in shooting down five enemy fighters (including three/twin-engined
twin-engined Messerschmitt 110&apos;s),  and secured hits on throe otherenemy fighters.      Our own losses were five aircraft.      Three ofthese aircraft are reported to have been brought down hy anti-aircraft fire,  and one of them,in falling,  collided with a fourthaircraft which was also brought down.      The fifth aircraft, whichis missing, may have forced-landed in Germany.3.      Continuous offensive patrols against enemy sea-olane bases.With a view to increasing our offensive effort against enemy mine-laying aircraft,  a series of offensive patrols were organisedduring the week over German seaplane bases at BORKUM,  SYLT andNORDERNEY.      The object of tnese operations was to interfere with,and to harass, enemy seaplanes employed in mine-laying operations.4.      The effect of these patrols was to impose a virtualblack-out on the bases in question, and thus greatly to handicapthe enemy operations-      Any lights seen on the water,  calculated to assist seaplanes in taking off in the dark, were systematicallyborribed.     Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire,  all aircraft engaged on these operations throughout the week returned safely.5.      These operations seem to have been successful since onthe five nights during which the offensive patrols were carriedout only one report was received indicating enemy aircraft engagedin mine-laying off our coasts and examination of the availabledata suggested that the enemy aircraft in question had taken off from their base before our offensive patrol arrived.Fighter Commandf6.      Enemy Aircraft.-      There were a number of minor raidsthroughout the week culminating in e. succession of seven separateraids during the afternocn of 17th December.7. On the night of 14th December an aircraft was plottedabout 14 miles south of the Isle of Wight, where it circled forten minutes. The purpose of this raid was not entirely clear,but as there was a possibility that the enemy aircraft had been engaged in mine-laying operations,  the Admiralty were informed and/advised
aadvised a change of course for the convoy which was due to passover the position on the following day.8.      At about 9 a,m, on the morning of 16th December, enemy aircraft were reported to be operating some distance off the coastbetween Flamborough Head and the Humber.      It is possible these aircraft were engaged in mine-laying.      Fighters were sent to investigate, but no contact was made.     Between 7 and 8 p.m. onthe night of 16th December,  aircraft were plotted fljring withinten miles of the coast in the Harwich area, where they remainedfor nearly an hour.      Bad weather prevented our fighters from taking off,9.      During the afternoon of 17th December,  seven separateraids at varying strength were made at points between Montrose andDungeness.      It is probable that some of these aircraft, were engaged on mine-laying, but in addition a number of attacks weremade on merchant vessels and trawlers,  as a result of which a smallmerchant vessel and a trawler were sunk.      Two aircraft of No.41Squadron intercepted an enemy aircraft off  /hit by and an attack was made, but darkness and clouds facilitated the raider&apos;s escape.Another fighter intercepted an enemy aircraft north of Amble, halfa mile east of ships at anchor..      A burst of three seconds wasfired,  to which the enemy replied before escaping into the clouds.A flight of No.611 Squadron sighted enemy aircraft in the Humberarea, but once again the enemy escaped into the clouds.      the anti-aircraft defences at Spurn Head and in the Humber also fireda few rounds, without known result,Coastal Command.10.      Anti-submarine patrols,  reconnaissances and searpheswere undertaken during the week,  and the prevalent bad weatherhad little effect on the Command&apos;s activities.      On 14th Decemberthe greater part of the Forth Sea was covered by patrols duringthe search for German worships referred to in paragraph 2.
4 . -s- lyi11.     Thirteen enemy aircraft wore sighted during the week,two of which were engaged.      In each case, the rear-gunner ofthe enemy aircraft was seen to have been hit,  and the aircraft,which were Dornier 18*s,  climbed into the clouds emitting blacksmoke, with oil pouring from the sponsons.      It is doubtfulwhether either was able to roach its base.      Eight Germandestroyers were sighted,  two of which were attacked with 250 lb.bombs;    and attacks were made on two enemy submarines,12.      On the 17th December,  enemy aircraft bombed individualmerchant vessels for the first time since the outbreak of war.(see paragraph 8).      Two Coastal Command aircraft on patrolfollowing one of these.attacks found ten men in an open boat,and directed a drifter to the spot.13.      Thirty-one convoys were provided with eir escortsduring the week,  involving the use of 117 aircraft-Advanced Air Striking Force.14.     There are no operations to report.Royal Air Force Component of the British Expeditionary Force.15.      Bad weather hampered operations,  and no reconnaissancesof North West Germany were possible.Overseas Commands,16.   . Anti-submarine patrols were carried out by the aircraft of the Mediterranean and Aden Commands, and convoy escorts were provided in the Mediterranean area.German Air Force Activity.17.      Apart from enemy activities described in preceding paragraphs, there were enemy reconnaissance flights over theNorth Sea and over North-East and South-East France.      On-12thDecember, there was considerable air activity over the north sea, which was almost certainly carried out in connection withthe return of the &quot;Bremen&quot;.     Three flights were made overFrance;    one on 13th December over Boulogne and Wimereux,another on 15th December over Martigny, and a third on 16thDecember over Strasbourg and Lower Alsace.,
Camouflage.18.     An unconfirmed report states that certain stretches ofthe concrete autobahnen, which are conspicuous from the air at night, have been sprayed black.French Air Force Operations.19.   &apos; Owing to&apos; the unfavourable weather conditions on theWestern Front, the operations of the French Air Force havebeen restricted during the week.     Reconnaissance flights wereattempted on 15th and 16th December, but the aircraft had to turn back shortly after taking off.
