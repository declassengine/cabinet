Cadogan recording a conversation with Dr. Rykens, of Unilever,Limited, on the subject of certain peace moves by Dr. Schacht. Attached toSir A. Cadogan&apos;s memorandum is a note by Dr. Rykens on conditions inGermany.H.Foreign Office, January 4, 1940.Memorandum by Sir A. Cadogan.PLEASE see the annexed memorandum by Dr. Rvkens on his recent visit to Holland. &apos; &apos;Dr. R. is employed by Unilever, Limited, and was introduced to me byMr. D&apos;Arcy Cooper, Chairman of that company.Mr. D&apos;Arcy Cooper brought Dr. Rykens round to see me this afternoon.Dr. R. told me that Mr. Hendriks (Unilever&apos;s representative in Holland)had lately been to Germany, where he had met Dr. Schacht. at the latter&apos;s request.Dr. Schacht seems to have said that it was essential for Germany to havepeace, and that the German Government were anxious to arrange a meeting oftwo representatives from each belligerent country (I don&apos;t know whether heincluded Poland and Russia!). Dr. Schacht said that, if such a meeting werearranged, he (Dr. S.) would certainly be one of the two German Delegates.I expressed some surprise, and doubt as to the position in Germany now heldby Dr. Schacht.Continuing- his story, Dr. Rykens said that Dr. Schacht realised there was probably nothing more that the Dutch and Belgian Governments could do atthe moment, and that it was necessary to mobilise President Roosevelt, and-Lh\ Schacht asked Mr. Hendriks whether there was anything the latter could do to that end.10802   [20575]
On Mr. Hendriks&apos; return to Holland, Dr. R. saw the Dutch Minister forForeign Affairs, who said he could do nothing without first consulting the queen. This he did. and later reported to Dr. R. that Her Majesty had expressed some scepticism on hearing of Dr. Schachfs connexion with the affair.It was, however, decided to instruct the Netherland Minister in washington to sound the President. The answer was that the President did not think thepresent moment opportune.That is the tale, for what it is worth not very much, I should think. Iftrue, it may be thought reassuring that the President hesitates to dabble in&quot;Peace Moves &quot; at the moment. We were beginning to fear that there mightbe some activities being planned between the Vatican, Mussolini and thePresident which might have caused us some embarrassment. But of course thePresident may have turned down this approach only because he was not satisfiedas to the credentials, or, indeed, because he was already dabbling in something of the kind with other quarters.Dr. Rykens said that &quot; everyone &quot; in Holland was now convinced that therewould be a German attack on Holland &quot; in the Spring.&quot; There was a uniteddetermination to resist and a good degree of confidence that a useful resistancecould be made on land.   The air was the great danger.. A. C.January 1, 1940.Note by Dr. Rykens on Conditions in Germany.I returned from Holland on Sunday, the 17th December, and during mystay there I received a great deal of information, partly from people who arein daily contact with conditions in Germany, and partly from quite a numberof German /Dutch nationals living in Germany and belonging to different classesof the population, including Government circles, Banking and Business worlds.The general tendency of these talks showed a great desire for peace,Bolshevism frequently being used as the bogey wdiich would ultimately threaten to involve not only Germany, but probably the whole of the Continent of Europe.Once or twice an indication was given by Germany that Holland particularlyhad every reason to work for peace, as, naturally, this country would be drawn into the war if an end could not be put to it in time.In some of the conversations a strong impression was established that thenon-aggressive wav in which the war, so far, has been carried on by the Allieshas contributed to the influence of Nazi propaganda on the German population.This propaganda repeats over and over again that economic conditions not onlyin England and France, but also in the surrounding neutral countries, are farworse than those existing in Germany. Proof is available that large numbersof the German population are deeply impressed by these facts which help.themto put up with the hardships demanded from them by strict rationing in Germany.They are not in a position to check the truth of the statements, and, therefore,naturally, accept what they are told. Equally, they believe that the Allies areas weak from a military point of view as they are economically. Repeatedlythe German Press and Wireless ask why England, in particular, is not attackingGermany, as England is the&quot; country who declared war and who, in Germaneyes, is responsible for same.It is sufficiently well known that losses both of the German Navy and theAir Force are not disclosed, or only to the extent of a fraction of reality. Again,the German population accepts these statements as they do the untrue statementsregarding England&apos;s losses both on the sea and in the air. The counter-propaganda can only get hold of a very small proportion of the German popula-tion, as the popular German wireless sets do not enable the lower classes to receiveforeign broadcasts, whereas families who keep servants are definitely afraid oflistening-in to foreign broadcasts. Frequently, even children in the household,when at school, have given away their parents, and it is therefore not surprising that only a very small percentage of the total population hear such foreignbroadcasts, and still a smaller percentage who believe in them.
It would seem that the only way to bring home the true state of affairs wouldbe to make such attacks on military and industrial objectives in Germany thatthe damage caused thereby could no longer be ignored. It has been pointed out to me that an air attack on similar objectives in-England would have the effect ,of uniting the population in this country and strengthening opposition. /Undoubtedly this is true, but in the case of Germany the effect, according to all sources of information save one, would be exactly the opposite. It is true thatthe effect on a very small number of the highest and better classes of the popula-tion would be comparable with that in England, but the conversations havedefinitely confirmed the view that in ninety out of a hundred cases attacks on german territory would not increase the hostile feeling towards England, but would create a strong opposition against the present regime in Germany, whichwould be held responsible. Lies which so far had been told to the population would then be disclosed.A view which was repeatedly expressed was that, if war were continued inthe present non-aggressive way, the danger that Germany would ultimatelybecome involved in Bolshevism would be far greater than if military superioritycould be demonstrated to the German people. Hence that good Germans, notbelonging to the Nazi Party, hold the view that, if peace cannot now be broughtabout, the only salvation for Germany would be a strong England attacking theGermans in their own country. This would stimulate opposition, whereas, atpresent, the German people are becoming more and more adverse to any inter-ference with their own Government, partly because terror is reigning freely andpartly because of the unjustified optimism as regards the ultimate end of the war.One highly placed German asked me why I thought Germany was not attack-ing London. Did I believe that this was done on humanitarian grounds or inorder to create a favourable impression in neutral countries ? He supplied the answer by saying that England and France were much better placed for attacking the Ruhr and the most essential industries located there than Germany was forattacking London or the East Coast. Also, surprise was expressed at Englishaeroplanes not having repeated their first attempt to attack the Kiel Canal whichwas not only very vulnerable, but which would upset German organisation con-siderably if partly or wholly blocked, as might be done if England were willing to sacrifice some planes.On the other hand, it is probable that German propaganda carried out in itspresent form will not allow Germany to sit still indefinitely, and reliable informa-lion both from various German sources and from the Dutch side confirm the viewthat positive German action is being planned for March or April 1940, if not before. The form which it would then probably take would be an attack onHolland and Belgium, which would bring the German Army in direct contact with French and British troops.Again, from reliable sources, it was learned that Germany is using theperiod between now and then for reconstructing a considerable part of herAir Force. Experience has shown that the German planes are out-manoeuvredby the English and French machines, and various series of planes which havebeen built in thousands of one and the same pattern are now being reconstructed.The main object seems to be to allow these planes^to^^&amp;sd^wtw^pds^wdiich thepresent construction does not allow. In order to husband their resources theconsumption of petrol has been reduced to a minimum, so that existing stocks are fully maintained for use during an offensive in the Spring. Home productionof petrol from coal is now taking place in three large factories of a size com-parable with the already previously existing Leuna Works. In each of these three factories from 35,000 to 40,000 work people are being employed, and theircombined production, together with one or two smaller units, is stated now to amount to 2,000,000 tons per annum.I have received practically official figures as regards the arrangements with roumania under which 15,000 tons of petrol are being sent each month by railto Germany. Besides these 180,000 tons in a full year, Germany expects toreceive some additional quantity by water. Special tank-boats are being eon-structed, but owing to existing difficulties, including the trans-shipment of the oil on account of rapids in the Danube, it is expected that these quantities willremain well below the figure of 180,000 tons above-mentioned. The total suppliesof petrol, therefore, from these sources seem negligible, and the same was also stated to be the case with Russian supplies.   Germany has, therefore, to rely
practically entirely on existing stocks and home production. A greater use oftheir Air Force would, therefore, be very unwelcome until combined with a generaloffensive as contemplated in the Spring.Another factor which has to be taken into consideration is the supply of iron-ore from Sweden. I was told that recently greatly increased .gu^n,tities,haclbeen received, but there is no doubt that fear exists in Germany that futureIsuppliesTnlght be affected if Russia were to attack Sweden and/or Norway as was considered quite likely.According to my information a new and very important station for military flying-boats has been established at Zwisschenhahn on the lake between Lehr andOldenburg.From an economic point of view the position of Germany is bad, but, for thetime being, not yet such that it would induce the population to revolt. The army is still well fed, and the civilian population receive sufficient bread of goodquality and also enough potatoes. There is no doubt that, in the long run, theEdible Oil and Fn-L^^Ttrcm-is the most serious for Germany. Imported stocksof these conunodities will be completely exhausted by the end of 1940. although a great deal is talked of supplies from Russia, Hungary and the Balkan States,yet the semi-official figures put before me show that the entire supply of SoyaBeans from Roumania (which constitute both the most important exporting country and the largest commodity exported in this field) only amounts to65,000 tons per annum. This quantity is, therefore, negligible. Supplies fromthe other Balkan States are well below this figure, whereas Hungary is unable to export any surplus Oil Seeds to Germany. Again, supplies from Russia are considered to be of practically no value.The chief item in the Fat consumption of Germany for 1940 is represented by the home production of Butter, which has now reached its peak at 600,000 tons,but which, for the year 1940, is not likely to exceed 450,000 tons as a result ofinsufficient feeding material for the cattle. This large production has only beenobtained as a result of the complete prohibition of the use of milk for any purposeother than the making of Butter. The population can, therefore, only drinkskimmed milk, and the farmer has been forbidden to have a churn on his farm, soas to compel him to deliver all his milk to the nearest factory. In this way the farmer is prevented from using his own Butter or selling it to his friends orneighbours. Excessive penalties, up to a few years&apos; imprisonment, exist for the farmer who does not give up every pint of milk obtained from his cattle.December 19, 1939.Note. Evidence of the methods applied for saving petrol are to be found,e.g. :-(1) in the absolute prohibition of the use of private motor cars (except forGovernment Officials, &amp;c),(2) in the practical abolition of taxis, and(3) in the purchase of steam tugs abroad, for which foreign currency is being paid, and which are replacing diesel-engine tugs now in use.
