Printed for the War Cabinet.  December 1939.SECRET.Copy /No.Q 16* .iW.P. (39) 176.TO BE  KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED ASSURANCE TO ICELAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.UNDER the terms of the war trade agreement with Iceland, the negotiationsfor which are nearing completion, there will be a complete cessation of trade between Iceland and Germany. The severity of this condition, which the icelandic delegation have been loath to accept, will be mitigated if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment can assure the Icelandic Government of support against possiblereprisals by the German Government,2. German reprisals would probably take the form of attempts to interferewith Icelandic shipping a threat in this sense has already been made and attacks on the Icelandic fishing fleet. Sufficient protection against such reprisalswould be afforded if British warships were despatched from time to time toIcelandic waters to reassure Icelandic shipping and fishing interests. No further measures would be necessary, or in any case possible, apart from the insurance ofIcelandic shipping against war risks at the expense of His Majesty&apos;s Government,which is now under consideration.3. It is conceivable, however, that the German Government might in certaincircumstances attempt an actual attack on Icelandic territory from the sea or fromthe air. In that event I should suppose that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe obliged to intervene in their own interests, whether or not they have given any previous guarantee to the Icelandic Government, since they could not contemplate the establishment of German forces in Iceland.4. After consideration of the commitments involved, the Admiralty andAir Ministry have decided that it is within our power to give assistance to the icelandic Government in the manner set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.5. I would therefore propose that, if my colleagues agree, a confidentialassurance should be. given to the Icelandic Government that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would take measures for the protection of Icelandic shipping andwould afford all the assistance in their power in the event of a German attack upon Iceland.H.December 28, 1939.10782   [20523]
