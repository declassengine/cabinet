4. A full record&quot;    of the discussion has already been circulated to the War Cabinet (paper No,, Wo?c(39)  159).Annexed to this record is a translation of the draft resolutions which were read out by General Gamelin on theconclusion of the discussion and on which we have undertaken to let him have out views after we have reported to theBritish War Cabinet.    It will,  therefore, be convenient if inthe first piece we examine these conclusions seriatim, and thereafter invite attention to certain other issues which arose in the course of the discussion0     We repeat these conclusions below and have placed our comments alongsideeach of the points raised by the French,,Draft Resolutions preparedby General Gamelin,I-      The military operationsvrtiich may be undertaken in the balkans are conditional upc-ncertain pre-existing politicalfactors.No Allied intervention in thrace can be contemplatedwithout the consent of Turkey;similarly, no landing at salonica &apos;is possible unless byagreement with Greece andsubject to the assent of Italy,Moreover, if it is decidedto undertake operations in the balkans, the forces to beemployed there can only be transported and, thereaftermaintained, if the attitude ofItaly is at the least one ofbenevolent neutrality.     Italy&apos;attitude also governs thequestion of the size of theforce the Allies can use for operations in the BalkanscComments by the Chiefs ofStaff,Comment f.^We entirely agree with thispresentation of the case , but would emphasise that, unless the neutral-ity of Italy is assured beyond, doubtthere could bo no question of any british Forces in the Pall meaning of the term be in;- sent to theBalkansc     As we stated inWoP.(39)149, all that we could doin these circumstances would be tr,supply such material and technicalunits as we could spare and despatch a small token force if the Turksshould ask for it.s   This draft has not yet been agreed, with the French, butwe are satisfied that the statements attributed tothem 9.ve       accurate representation of their viewpoints-

I,     The problem of Alliedntervention in the Balkans variesn its determining conditionsscording as we envisage:a) Mere assistance to turkey in the defence of Thrace;b) Assistance to Greece in thedefence of Salonika;    orc) On the contrary, the con-stitution of a Frontincluding Yugoslavia andthe greater part of roumania, this presupposingthe previous settlementof the Bulgarian question.Cormnent 2.We agree with thesevariations ef the problems whichmay be presented to us eithersingly or simultaneously.II. In the existing political*nd military circumstances, wecan do no more than initiate^reparations for allied intervention, namely:(a)    Prepare Allied bases inTurkey and at salonica.C omment 5.Wo entirely agree that atthis stage we should do no morethan initiate preparations for .Allied intervention.   On the otherhand we have hithertc- consideredour policy in the Middle East ona long term basis.      The french proposals now contemplate thepossibility of intervention at anearly dato i.e. Spring of 1940.This will involve a considerablechange in policy in that we have at present no resources availablefor effective intervention unlessthe neutrality of Italy is assuredbeyond doubt.      Such resources,can be built up only at thejexpense of Western Europe.    Major/questions of priority will thusariso and will have to be studied in detail with the French.Comment 4.The term &quot;Allied&quot; is somewhatmisleading.    In point of factwhat we require is that turkey and Greece should themselvesdevelop their ports, aerodromes and communications and be pre-pared to accept such heavy non-military equipment as may bestored in selected areas prior tothe development of any operations.Moreover in our case development will not be confined to Balkanterritory but must extenJL to egypt and Palestine.As regards Salonica we woulddirect special attention to the considerations set out in paras.13 to 17 of the Annex to.V.P.(39)  14,

(b)   Endeavour to secure under conditions of the utmostsecrecy, a discreet formof co-operation betweenthe General Staffs ofthe various Balkan powersand our own General Staffs,with the object of settlingvarious points of amilitary character.Comment 5-.,We were unaware of therecent approaches made by the yugoslavs,  the Greeks and the roumanians,to the French,described by General Gamelin inparagraphs 6,7 and 8 cfW.P.  (39) 159.       As the french have always maintained a close and special contact with themajority of the Balkan powerswe agree that they are in abetter position to engage inthis form of negotiation withYugoslavia, Roumania and Greece.In view of the close relations which exist between yugoslavia and Italy&apos; it is important thatno independent approach shouldbe made to the former whichmight cause friction with thelatter.      It would be undesirable that conversations should betripartite in view of theattention which they would attract.We consider that the Frenchcould well handle these[negotiations and without commit-committing  us, keep us fully informed.JThe case of Turkey, however,  is(different and negotiations shouldfbe tripartite in view of our5Treaty commitments.(c)    Assist those powers inthe economic sphere bythe grant of creditsand in the armamentsphere, by the supply,more particularly, of anti-tank and anti-aircraft equipment,together with certainaircraft, in so far aswe are able to deliversuch aircraft.Comment 60Quite clearly the supplyof these equipments can only becarried out at the expense of western Europe.      This will raise important questions of priority which will vary inrespect of each item of equipment and must be examined in detail by the joint Staffs and be madethe subject of a future report.The equipments which will berequired are the very articles rfwhich we, ourselves,  are so s^hortOn the other hand, as general weygand aptly points out&quot;Sacrifice on our part was essential.    In war time noone could have all they wanted.&quot;

Undertake a study on theAllied side of questions connected with theconstitution of ourinterventionary forcesin the several hypothesescontemplated with theconditions of transport and of the protection of transports, and with suchrapid assistance as we might he able to give inthe Balkans from the standpoint of&apos; the Air Force.Comment 7.we agree that a comprehensivestudy of the whole problem of intervention in the Balkans in the spring of 19^0 must be undertaken by the French and British Staffs in collaboration,regard must be created by theof shipping.In particular,  duepaid toseriousthe problemshortage5. We now turn to deal with certain other points raised in the discussion which have a bearing on the draft resolutionsput forward by General Gamelin.An approach ,.to I taly.6. The first of these is the question of an approach toItaly.      There is some diversity of views as expressed inparagraphs k-1 and U.8 of the record, of the discussion (V/.P,   (39)159).7. General Gamelin expressed the difficulty of the problem in the following terms:-&quot;The political question was a most delicate one,particularly as to when and how the matter shouldhe broached to Italy;    before the danger had actuallymaterialised? or only at the last moment?8, General Weygand maintained that it would be a great mistake to ask the permission of Italy before we did. anything in the Balkans in the way of preparation.      Such an approach would in his view almost certainly meet with rebuff.      It was preferable to proceed with our preparations and subsequentlyexplain to Italy that the defence of the Balkans against bolshevism was in accordance with traditional Italian policy,9. Iu parenthesis, we would draw attention to the remarksof M.   Leger to the British Ambassador in Paris as reportedin Paris Telegram 9?2 (Saving) to the following effect:-

&quot;It was, however, probable tha&quot;C if we merelyannounced our intentions to him (i,e. Mussolini)and accompanied&apos;the announcement with appropriateassurances,  the knowledge that we intended to oppose the German advance to the Aegean wouldfortify him in preserving his neutrality.&quot;10. In this connection it will be recalled that itwas agreed at the second meeting of the Supreme War council that Italy should be kept informed, at least in respectof any action arising out of the Turkish Treaty.     (VideS.W.C.(39) 2nd Meeting, page lx).      The course to befollowed now is a matter for political decision, but wewould emphasise that the whole of the Military situationin the Middle East will depend upon the outcome of thisdiplomatic problem.The  immediate initiation of preparations.11. If we are to be in a position to intervene inthe Balkans by the Spring of 19^0,  it is essential thatthe preparations, without which our intervention could not hope to be effective,  should be decided upon immediately.They will take some time to complete;    and if they arenot begun at once we may find ourselves either unable to intervene when the situation demands it or forced to do soat the risk of a repetition of those administrativefailures which have had such disastrous results in thepasta12. We would emphasise that a decision to set thesepreparations on foot at once in no way commits HisMajesty&apos;s Government to this or that course of action.It would merely confer upon them the power to interveneeffectively if it should be so decided in the light of future developments.      Without wishing to anticipate eventswe should again emphasise that if this decision were tobe forced upon us within the next few months,  in view ofour limited resources it could only be implemented at theexpense of our position in the West,.

Conclusions and RecormneiiNations o13.       Our conclusions and recommendations may besummarised as follows: -(a)    We recommend general approval of the draft-resolutions put forward by General Gamelin(Annex to paper No, W-P. (39)  159)  subjectto the comments which we have made againsteach of theirio     In particular -(i)    Wo cordially agree that in existingpolitical and military circumstances;we can doviio more than raalco preparations for AlliecT^intcrventioii in the BalkansotAn essential feature of such preparationsis the de^riopment of bases and communications nob only in Turkey andat...-Salonika, but also in Egypt andPalestineTy(ii) We recommend that the French should undertake immediate military conversations with Greece and Roumanianand also with Yugoslavia, provided thatthis can be done without offendingItalian susceptibilities.      The french should keep us informed of the progressof these conversations, but should not commit the Allies to any particular course of action without reference to the  Supreme War council      fjo far asTurkey is concerned, tripartiteconversations should be begun as soonas the Turks arc willing,-.(iii)    We endorse the French proposal that weshould assist the above Balkan powers in the spheres aoth of economics and ofarmamentSn      The latter will raiseimportant cueations of priority, not - ulyas between the Western and EasternTheatres^ but also as between the variouspowers concerned.      The Joint staffs should therefore be instructed toexamine and report as soon as possible on the character and extent of theassistance that can be rendered both bythe French and ourselves.(iv)    We agree that a comprehensive study ofthe whole problem of intervention in the balkans in the spring of 1940   r should boundertaken by the French and theBritish Staffs in aellaborat3 on,,

(b)    If we are to be in a position to interveneeffectively in the Balkans by the spring of1940, the preparatory action contemplated inthe preceding paragraph must be initiatedat once, especially in the administrativesphere.     What is required, therefore, fromthe military point of view is a definiteinstruction from the War Cabinet, and ultimately from the Supreme War Council, toprepare for the possible extension ofhostilities to the Balkans in the spring of1940.(c) The delicate question of when and how thematters dealt with in this Report should bebroached to Italy is a political one.     Wesubmit that it might with advantage beconsidered at an early meeting of the supreme war Qouncil.Central War Room,13th Deeember, 1939.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.&quot; EDMUND IRONSIDE.&quot; R.E.C.
