TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to 251MOST SECRET.      ensure the secrec* of this documeiCOPY NO     -   2hL &apos; &apos;W.P.(40) 7.WAR CABINET.THE AIR STRENGTHS OF GREAT BRITAIN,  FRANCEAND   GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State    for   Air.1.        At their 74th Meeting held on the 7th Novembers  1939,  theWar Cabinet took note of a statement&quot;&apos;&quot; furnished by the Air Ministryrelating to the aircraft production position in Great Britain,Prance and Germany during the period ending on the 51st March,  1940son the assumption that factories were not hampered by air attackduring the preceding six months.    This statement also containedinformation regarding the measure of expansion of our first line strength which might be achieved, and a forecast of the air personnel situation, over the same period.2.       At the same time I was invited to submit the following further papers to the War Cabinet:-(a) Beginning on the 1st January, 1940, quarterlystatements giving particulars for the ensuingsix months on the same lines as those given in w.P.(39)  102.(b) A statement showing what percentage of the totalcapacity of the aircraft industry would be devotedto the construction of the new heavy bombers (the halifax and Manchester classes) when these typoswere in full production.(c) Detailed analyses showing -(i)    The total production of aircraft of each maintype (e.g.  fighters, bombers, trainers-, etc.)between the 1st April, 1939, and the 1stOctober, 1939, and the purpose to which theaircraft in each of these main types were put.(ii) A similar statement in respect of the anticipated total production of aircraftbetween October,  1939, and the 31st March,1940.(iii) The statements in (i) and (ii) to show theuse made of any aircraft displaced by theproduction of newer types during these .periods.* W.P. (39)  102.

Production.3.      In accordance with requirement (a) above, I appendbelow an estimate, by types, of the production figures likely tobe reached by British industry in March and June,  19L0.     As I mentioned in my previous statement,  certain adverse factors whichhad then become apparent made it seem unlikely that the productionfigure of 892 for the month of September would be exceeded duringthe period ending the 31st March, I3k0,      This forecast has proved, true up to date, although the adverse factors in questionnaire likely to have a diminishing effect in future months unlessthe situation is again aggravated by a further calling up of men now engaged in the aircraft industry.     a number of the ArmyReservists who were temporarily released from military service to continue their existing employment are due for calling up not later than 1st March, 19^+0, and it is difficult to say what theeffect of this loss of labour will be.      The firms concerned have, however, had adequate notice of this loss, and it is to be hoped that any reduction of output due to this cause will be negligible.      The depletion of the resources of the aircraft industry in skilled personnel by reason of the calling up of menduring 1 9h0 is an altogether more serious matter.      It should be emphasised that unless effective steps are taken to protect theaircraft industry from the worst effects of the calling up,  theresult on aircraft production throughout the year will be grave.h.      The following is an estimate of the figures asked for:CLASS OP AIRCRAFT. MARCH,  19^0.    JUNE,  19^0.Bombers. 296 360Fighters. 152 237Army Co-operation and Reconnaissance. U1 5hCoastal and Ship-borne. 152 20hBomber- Transport. 5Trainers. 225 283869 &quot; 1,138

Bombers. 195Fighters. 175Reconnaissance. 115Coastal and ship-borne. 46Trainers. 250781The French Production Mission have not supplied figures showingtheir forecast of deliveries from March to June, 1940, but certain information which the Air Staff have obtained from theFrench Air Staff, on which the latter are understood to bebasing their plans, indicates that the total French productionmay rise to something over 900 per month by June.      There isno question that the French have, during recent months,approached the problem of aircraft production in a far more realistic manner than previously;    but I feel bound to suggestthat their forecasts are most unlikely to be realised.    for.     As before, the figures shown against &quot;Bombers&quot;include the total monthly output of Blenheim aircraft, although a number of these are now being employed as fighters and onreconnaissance and training duties as well as for bombing.     the type was originally designed as a bomber, and for the sake ofsimplicity it seems best to show the production under that head.It will be seen that my previous forecast of a sharp rise in theproduction of fighters in the months following March, 1940, islikely to be amply justified, the probable increase betweenDecember, 1939* and June, 1940, being in the neighbourhood of 100%.6.      On the 1st January the French Production Missionsupplied us with figures showing the output achieved by theFrench aircraft industry during October, November and December,1939* and their estimated deliveries up to the end of March,1940.     According to their forecast, their output, by types,during March, 1940, will be as follows:-

December and January the totals of aircraft delivered and fore-cast are only slightly above 400.7.     Reliable information on German production, difficult tobtain even in peace-time, is scarcer than ever in time of war.On the outbreak of war it was possible on the basis of the wide variety of data available to estimate the current rate of pro-duct ion and the rate of increase of production.     Under war conditions many valuable sources of information disappeared, and though other sources are gradually being built up, the problemof making a reliablo estimate of German production is one ofgreat difficulty,8.     The essence of the problem is to determine whether therate of increase of German production has been maintained sincethe outbreak of war.     We know that in our own case, the rateof increase has not boon maintained, and that, as pointed outelsewhere in this paper, the production rate achieved inSeptember, 1939, will not be exceeded until after March, 1940.Three of the main factors to which this is to be attributed,namely,  (a) calling up of reservists,  (b) black-out conditions,and,  (c) effect on production of change-over to more moderntypes may apply to German production.      But we have no definite evidence that these limiting factors are operating on Germanproduction, and still less is there any evidence on which tomake a quantitative assessment of their effect.     Again wecannot say for certain that either labour or raw material willexert a limiting influence in the period under review, though there are grounds for thinking they may well do so.     evidence from various sources is to the effect that the factory spaceavailable in Germany at the outbreak of war was fully adequate for the expansion in production estimated over this period. -On the assumption, therefore, that the German production ratehas continued and will continue to expand unrestricted by any*f the factors mentioned above, the rate of output by June, 1940might reach the figure of 2,050 a month.

5- ...2559.      There is, however, an important qualification to this statement.      It will he seen that the figure for German produc-tion quoted in paragraph 8 is based on the assumption,  inter alia,that no preparations are being made in the German aircraft industry during the period for a change-over of types.      If thisis so there will be a corresponding delay in the introductionof more modern German types.      If, on the other hand, a change-over of types does take place during the period (though as stated there is no present indication of this) a temporaryflattening of the production curve will certainly result, andthe figure of 2,050 a month will not be realised, with a corres-ponding effect on the Allied/German production ratio0Personnel:10.    The requirements, based on the known commitments inflying personnel and skilled tradesmen, which it is estimatedwill have to be maintained during the period up to June, 1940,are as follows:-Flying Personnel:Pilots 12,600Observers 1,500Air Gunners 3,800Slcilled Tradesmen:Fitter Group 35,000Wireless and electrical Group 11,800Instrument Group 1,850Armament Group 5,000The personnel position is, in general, satisfactory.On the assumption that the present rate of wastage continuesuntil 31st March, 1940, and that thereafter there are operations at the sustained rate, there would be certain minor deficiencies in regard to flying personnel.     These deficiencies would, inpractice, be met? by a small reduction in operational effortover the period,,     As regards technical personnel, a measure ofdilution in the highly skilled trades must continue, but, on

this understanding, and on the same assumption as regardsoperations, the situation can &quot;be regarded as acceptable.Percentage of Production devoted to Heavy Bombers.11.    As regards requirement  (b) in paragraph 2 above,  thepercentage of aircraft production which will be devoted to theconstruction of heavy bombers of the HALIFAX and MANCHESTERclasses is estimated as followsJuly,  1940. July,  1941. July,  1942.12.5^ 2533c/o 27,T/oThe above figures have been calculated on the basis of airframeman hours which represent the best basis of comparison in termsof productive effort in that it takes account of the work doneby sub-contractors as well as by the main firms.Analyses of the disposal of Productive Output,12.    The following is the analysis called for underrequirement  (c)(i) of paragraph 2r showing the deliveries of aircraft by main operational classes between 1st April, 1939,and 1st October,  1939, and the uses to which they have been put.General ArmyBombers.

Similarly, all Anson aircraft have been shown under the head-ing lGeneral Reconnaissance , although also used largely for training purposes.

13.    In order to fulfil requirement (c)  (ii) it is obviously necessary to make some arbitrary assumption as to thecourse of the war0      As a basis for a forecast,  it has been assumed that air operations on an intensive scale will not havebecun by 51st March, 1940, that wastage will continue to be experienced at approximately the present rate, and that theAir Ministry&apos;s present plans for the development of the RoyalAir Force will, in the main, be capable of fulfilment up tothe end of the period with which the analysis is concerned.14.    On the above assumptions it is estimated tnat the operational strength of the Metropolitan Air Force on the 51stMarch,  1940, will be 127 squadrons, totalling 2,038 aircraft,,This total excludes all squadrons which, although formed, havenot yet reached a state of training or equipment which would justify their inclusion in an operational total.      The totalfirst line strength, that is to say the total of the initialequipment of all formed squadrons,  is therefore higher thanthe operational total.      On the assumptions set out in paragraph15 above it is estimated that the first line strength on 51stMarch, 1940 will amount to 155 squadrons of 2,126 first line aircraft.15.    The operational total quoted above for 51st March,1940,  exceeds by 582 the operational total for 50th September,1959, which was l,456n      This increase is accounted for asfollows:-(a) The formation of 18 new fighter squadrons, of which14 will be fit to take their place in the operationaltotal by 31st March, 1940.(b) The raising of the establishment of all operationalheavy bomber squadrons from 12 to 16 initial equip-ment aircraft each,(c) The raising of the establishment of a number of army co-operation squadrons from 12 to 18 initial equip-ment aircraft each.

(See table overleaf, )(d) The raising of the establishment of a number ofGeneral Reconnaissance squadrons to 21 initialequipment aircraft each.(e) The inclusion in the operational total of 11 squadrons(9 Bomber, 1 Fighter, 1 Army Co-operation) which were excluded on 30th September,  1939, either because ofdeficiencies in training or equipment, or due to the&apos;rolling-up&apos; of squadrons on the outbreak, of war(see para.2 of Appendix A to W.PC(39) 102).16.    It should perhaps be stated that one factor whichlimits the rate at which our operational strength can increase is the necessity for utilising a proportion of our resources for the formation of operational training units.     These units(which are of course excluded from the operational, first line,and reserve totals) are used to train the output of the flying training Schools up to the standard at which pilots and crewscan join the squadrons and be ready for operations?     war experience has confirmed the need for, and the immense value of,these units, which nevertheless constitute an unavoidable call upon the total of men and equipment available for all purposes.17.    The allotment of operational types of aircraftproduced between 1st October, 1939, and 31st March, 1940 isanticipated to be as follows

Our policy is to despatch as fewaircraft as possible away from the Metropolitan theatre ofwar, and it is hoped that overseas commands will be. able tosubsist on their own resources,,(3)   No aircraft are shown as allocated to Dominion and Foreignorders because of the extreme difficulty of giving-even an approximate forecast;    any aircraft sent abroad will come out of reservess(4)    The total number of bombers and GSR* aircraft available for allocation during the later six months is less than that ofthe earlier six months.      The reason for this is, as regardsbombers, that a considerable proportion of the BATTLEaircraft now being produced are no longer operational types,but are capable of being used only for training purposes.As regards G.R. types, a limited number of ANSONS are also being produced which are suited only for training purposes.The principal factor in the smaller number of G.R. aircraft during the later six months is, however, the cessation of deliveries from America during a considerable period,(5)   Relatively few aircraft rjfrom production will be allocatedduring the later six months to re-arming and to increasingthe strength of first line squadrons, because the greaterpart of the aircraft required for this purpose will bedrawn from existing reserves, most of which were producedduring the previous period.

18.    The total number of trainer type aircraft deliveredfrom the factories during the period 1st April to 1st October,1939, was approximately 1,250;    the corresponding total for the later six months is estimated to be approximately 1,200, towhich should be added a total of 300 Battles and Ansons whichare not taken to meet operational requirements..19.    During both periods, aircraft released by re-armingsquadrons with newer types have been or will be placed in reserve behind the remaining first line squadrons still using the older type concerned, or transferred to training andtraining reserve.K0W0Air Ministry.5th January, 1940.
