OSTSSCRET.COPY NOWEEKLY REPORT (NO.19) ON AIR OPERATIONS and intelligence FOR THE WEEK ENDING MIDNIGHT14TH JANUARY.   194-0.OPERATIONS.B-qm.be r &quot;Command, c1.There have been no major offensive operations duringthe week, but patrol and reconnaissance activity has been on aconsiderable scale.      Offensive patrol over Borkum and Sylthas been maintained nightly, except on the 8th and 10th, whenweather conditions made it unlikely that enemy seaplanes could operate.     On two occasions bombs were dropped on flare pathswhich were promptly extinguished.2.        Combined leaflet and reconnaissance raids penetrateddeeplj7- to many parts of Germany during the week.      Reconnaissancewas particularly directed to any signs of unusual activity in thearea adjacent to the Dutch and Belgian frontiers and our patrols were over the railway marshalling yards of Emmerich, Rheine,osnabruck and Hamm on the nights of the 9th and the 11th.    Leafletraids have covered Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Kiel, Hamburg and Bremenand were extended on the 12th to Prague and Vienna,      Visibilits&apos;was good on most of these occasions,  and the black-out wasindifferent, especially in South Germany and in Austria.3.       Extensive North Sea reconnaissance was carried outon the 10th,  12th and 13th,  and on the first of these occasions a force of nine Blenheims was intercepted at sea by five        . &quot;Messerschmitt 110ss.      A running fight ensued at various heightsbetween 5,000 feet and sea level, in the course of which oneBlenheim was shot down and one was damaged but returned safely toits base.      One Messerschmitt was shot down in the sea, oneforced-landed in Denmark and one other was seen to be seriously damaged.      The enemy broke off the action after twenty-fiveminutes and our aircraft proceeded with their patrol 130 milesfarther eastward.

4. The Advanced Air Striking Force provided sixty-sevenfighter patrols during the week involving 119 aircraft, hut on theonly occasion on which an enemy aircraft was seen it evadedaction.    A Blenheim on photographic reconnaissance in the Trierneighbourhood on the 12th was attached at 20,000 feet by fourMesserschmitts.    Our aircraft was forced to breaic off there connaissance but landed safely at a French aerodrome.Fighter Command.5. The activities of Fighter Command during the week arebest summarised by giving brief statistics of their activity -patrols Aircraft.8th January 14 409th        &quot; 16 5210th        &quot; 84 24611th        &quot; 86&apos; 25212th        &quot; 78 23013th        &quot; 52 16314th        &quot; 16 46As will be seen,  patrols were greatly intensified as a result ofGerman activity against shipping and new standing patrols wereinstituted as an immediate measure.    On the 14th,  enemy activitydecreased, partly owing to weather conditions, and fewer patrols were necessary.    In future it is expected that the standing patrolmay be considerably reduced in scale owing to the extension ofother protective measures.6, On the 9th and 10th light fog made interceptionextremely difficult,    On the 11th,  a Heinkel 111 Mark V was intercepted off Cromer and seriously damaged, by our fighters whileattacking the S.S:   &quot;Keynes&quot;..    This enemy aircraft is possiblyidentical with the Heinkel 111 which forced-landed later in denmark.    On the 12th,  a Dornier 17 was sighted by our aircraft over the Thames Estuary,,    Anti-aircraft guns opened fire, but theraider was lost in cloud.    On the 13th.  a Heinkel 111K was caughtoff the Forth by three Hurricanes and four Spitfires (one armed with&quot;cannons) and was driven down into the sea..      One member of/the

the crew was rescued by one of our fast rescue launches after an exhaustive search.      The remainder of the crew had beenkilledoCoastal Command.7.       Forty-eight routine and ninety special patrols were flown during the week.      An escort was provided for forty-threeconvoys, including leave boats.     On the 10th, a Hudson had a sharp encounter with a Heinkel 111K some 170 miles off theAberdeenshire coast.      Our aircraft persisted in its attacksuntil its front gun ammunition was exhausted and its two rearguns jammed;    it then attacked with two 250 lb. bombs whichnarrowly missed astern.      The rear gun of the Heinkel had beensilenced and the aircraft itself appeared to be damaged.      Onthe 11th January,  three German destroyers were sighted by twopatrolling Hudsons in the eastern half of the North Sea andwere attacked with bombs without success from about 12,000feet;    the enemy&apos;s anti-aircraft fire was ineffective.      On thesame day an enemy aircraft was seen to approach the East Coastconvoy but it avoided contact when pursued,8.        Nine mines were seen from the air, mainly in theChannel, and there were four submarine sightings.      On the 15tha Coastal Command aircraft and. a high speed launch co-operated in searching for the c^ew of a Heinkel brought down off the firth of Forth and one German airman was eventually foundswimming 20 milen from, land.,Royal Air Force, Cpmgonent^- British Expeditionary Force.9o        leather conditions in France have improved somewhatduring the week and. have permitted a certain increase in activity.The usual fighter patrols and. training and. phtographic flights overthe British Expeditionary Force area have been maintained withoutencountering the enemy.,  and. there have been a number of more extensive reconnaissances of North Western Germany.      On the 10th11th and 12th January, Blenheims of the Air Component conducted&apos;photographic/

photographic flights over the Rhine continuing Northabout toaerodromes in England.      There was a slight haze on most ofthese occasions which, in combination with the regular pall ofsmoke over the industrial areas, restricted visibility;    someuseful results were nevertheless obtained.      Two similar dayreconnaissances and one night flight were made on the 15th by aircraft which returned to their aerodromes in Prance.Overseas Commands.10.     Anti-submarine patrols have been flown in theMediterranean and from Aden, and twelve convoy escorts were provided by aircraft operating from Gibraltar.AIR INTELLIGENCE.German Air Activity.11.      There has been a revival during the past week of thecompaign against small vessels in the North Sea which was begunon 17th and 18th December, and then abandoned.      The attacksopened on the 9th January and were particularly intense on that day when weather conditions were unfavourable to the defence.There were at least sixteen incidents,  two ships were sunk andone abandoned,.      Standing fighter patrols were then institutedand certain supplementary defence measures put in train.      Onthe 10th,  there were only two attacks;    on the 11th, nine;    andon the 12th, seven.      Since that date,  the usual meteorologicaland other reconnaissance flights have been maintained, butoffensive action has not been renewed.12.     Although the attacks were spread over most of theEast Coast area from Aberdeen southwards, a comparatively small number of aircraft were involved.      The most recorded as activeat any one time were seventeen on the 12th, and the attacks weremade by aircraft acting singly or in pairs.      Bombing seems tohave been somewhat more accurate than on previous occasions, andthe/

the number of ships set on fire suggests that incendiary bombs were used;    confirmation of this has not yet been obtained.German losses were:-(Certain)       One Heinkel 111K on the 13th.      ThisHeinkel belonged to a special reconnaissanceunit formed out of the Lufthansa fleet;(Possible)     One Heinkel 111, Mark V, on the 11th.Damage was also done to another Heinkel on the 10th.13.      Mine-laying has been reported on four occasionsduring the week, on one of these by seaplanes coming down onthe water at night.14,      The most recent information in regard to Flak ships is as follows.      There appears to be an outer ring of such ships located on the circumference of a circle radius 65 sea milesfrom Heligoland, and the ships are dotted thickly within 25 seamiles of the north west German coast.      They arealso locatedalong the west coast of Denmark within 40 sea miles of the coast.French Air Activity.15.      Activity was somewhat restricted in the earlier partdf the week, but conditions.improved after the 10th and operations have been carried out by day and by night over enemy territory.      Fourteen photographic and seven night reconnaissanceswere flown, and, during the latter, leaflets were scattered over germany.16.      Fighters made 468 sorties and engaged the enemy hnfive occasions;    two German aircraft were shot down.Belgium.17.      The number of aircraft with operational units is to-day approximately: -14 Battles20 Hurricanes18 Gloster Gladiators12 Renard (the only aircraft of Belgian design)60 Fairey Foxes60 Fairey Fireflies

18.      It is believed that the Belgians have a small numberof Fairey types in reserve, and that a considerable number ofthose given above as in units are actually undergoing extensiveoverhaul.      The Repair and Maintenance Organisation of theBelgian Air Service is extremely limited, and it is probable that not more than 140-150 aircraft could immediately take the air.19.      The Belgians are using every endeavour to obtainmodern aircraft from abroad, but it is unlikely that they willbe able to increase their first line strength by these meassbefore the end of the Spring,20,     While the effective strength of the Belgian Air force is likely at present to prove considerably less than its nominalfirst-line strength, there is reason to believe that thestrength of the antic-aircraft artillery exceeds the estimateshitherto current.      The guns in service are now believed toinclude 120 75 mns guns, 60 Bofcrs 40 mm, guns, and eightVickers 3.7&quot; guns.Russo-Finnish War.21.     Russian air strategy has shown no new developmentduring the week.      There have been regular bombing attacks onports and railway centres, in particular Helsinki, Aabo, Hangoeand Lahti.       Tone of these operations was particularly success-ful but their cumulative effect is likely to be serioiis,      a parachute attack which was attempted in the Isthmus front ended in Disaster.22.      Interrogation of prisoners confirms the impression of. the inadequacy of Russian training methods0      Few pilot6have passed through full courses of night flying training andinstrument training;    and advanced tactical and bombingtraining appears also to have been rudimentary-,23.      The Finns admit the loss of four Fokker GX;s (army co-operation) in addition to those reported in ,;eekly Report No.17, and now claim that 109 Russian aircraft were brought down upto/

to 25th December, of which eighty-eight were S.B. medium bombers.    Forty-three Brewster fighters which were being completed for delivery to the United States Air Corps are now tobe released for shipment to Finland.    Six are already available for shipment, and the remainder will be ready by theend of January.24,       Finnish bombing raids have so far been directed against ammunition dumps, Army Headquarters and the importantrail head at Petrozavodsk on Lake Onega, and Russian camp firesmade a particularly good target for night attack.    There havealso been leaflet raids on Leningrad.
