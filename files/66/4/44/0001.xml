14-:tAR CABINET.ASSISTANCE TO FINLAND.REFO...T BY TIE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFEL iCE.The Military Co-ordination Committee were instructed&quot;by the &quot;&quot;ar Cabinet at their Meeting on the 4th January, 1940**,to undertake, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal and arepresentative of the Foreign Office, a comprehensive examina-tion of all the methods,  short of direct military intervention,by which assistance could be given to Finland:  and to submit recommendations to the Jar Cabinet as soon as possible.Those Members of the Committee who were able to take partin the discussions have invited rne to report on their behalfto the v/ar Cabinet.2.        Our preliminary discussions on this subject have-immediately brought us face to face with two problems onwhich guidance from the war Cabinet is necessary:-(i)    The character and degree of assistance whichwe are prepared to render to Finland.(ii)    The form of organisation,  if any, required toco-ordinate such assistance, which in turndepends on the answer to (i) above.3. The terms of the resolution of the Assembly of theLeague of Nations on this subject which was adopted on the14th December,  :..939j,  are as follows:-&quot;The Assembly urgently appeals to every Member of theLeague to provide Finland with such material and humanitarianassistance as may be in its power, and to refrain from any action which might weaken Finland&apos;s power of resistance.&quot;V/e are already rendering material assistance to Finlandin the form of arms and military equipment, and a reporton the further requirements of Finland, from Brigadier Ling,who has been deputed by the   .:ar Office to visitGeneral Marmerheim, is awaited. ,&apos;e shall not be in a* Y/.Mo (40) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 6.-1-C0..T HO.0TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND feEY. 39It is requested that special care may be ty^ken toensure the secrecy of this document.

position to make our recommendations on this aspect of thematter until Brigadier Ling&apos;s report has been received.In the meantime the question arises of allowingvolunteers to proceed to Finland and of the Organisationrequired   in connection therewith-4* If, as at present, our assistance to Finland is totake the form of limited and occasional supplies of equipment(sometimes as gifts);,  there is no need, for any specialorganisation..      The business can be handled in the same way as we have handled assistance to Turkey, i,e.  each department concerned can deal individually with theFinnish representatives- any co-ordination necessary being undertaken by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.If, on the other hand?our assistance to Finlandis to take the form of a liberal and continuous flownot only of equipment but also of personnel (some of whommight conceivably be volunteers from the armed forces ofthe crown, released under special arrangements) a special &quot;Aid to Finland&quot; Organisation will certainly be required.5. The first questions for decision by the War Cabinetaccordingly appear to us to be as follows: -(i) Is our assistance to Finland to belimited,as at present,  to occasionalsupplies of equipment (sometimes asgifts)c      Or(ii) Is our assistance to be extended inthe form of a flow of equipment and of personnel?And if the answer to (ii) above isin the affirmative -(iii) Are such personnel to be recruitedand despatched by purely unofficialsources without Government assistance and control?If it is decided that Government assistance and control are necessary, this raises the question whether such control should be given overtly or sub rosas

A decision as to whether volunteers from the armed forcesof the Crown should he released under special arrangements, can be  held over for the immediate future.     We are hov/ever of theopinion that if volunteers are to he permitted to go to Finlanda measure of Government control and assistance, even if not overt,is desirablec    Moreover,  in the case of volunteers, a licencefrom the Grown would probably be necessary in order to avoid a breach of the Foreign EiajJJLstment Act.60 On the assumption that the War Cabinet decides to give assistance in the recruitment and equipping of volunteers, weare of opinion thax a special Bureau will &quot;be required.     in discussing the form which this Bureau should take, we have hadthe benefit of the advice of Lt.-General Sir George Macdonogh,G.B.3., K.C.B., K.C.M.G., President of the Anglo-Finnish Society.Broadly speaking, the Organisation to be set up may take one of two forms:-!1(i) An official &quot;Aid to.Finland&quot; Bureau under the aegis of a Minister - possibly the Minister for. Co-ordination of Defence, and supported againstcriticism from at home or abroad by the acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the resolution of theLeague of Nations quoted earlier in Paragraph 3 ofthis report.(ii) A professedly unofficial &quot;Aid to Finland&quot; Bureau, setup under the cloak of the Anglo-Finnish Society, but with official guidance and with official contact with Government Departments.We discuss these alternatives below, but we recommend that,whichever is adopted, Sir Goerge Macdonogh should be appointed as the Head of the Bureau.7. We would also emphasise that the Foreign Office considerthat in view of possible Swedish reactions, any ostentatious aid to Finland should be avoided.    The correspondence between  isMajesty&apos;s Government and the Swedish Government regarding help to be given to Finland (see Annex) shows that the -swedish government...are--par-tirmla^ly anxious not to be openly associatedwith any assistance which His Majesty.^ Government may be giving.It is to be expected, therefore, that unless they are handledvery carefully they may raise objections to the transit of Britishvolunteers through Sweden to Finland (apart from actualtechnicians accompanying war material supplied by this country).-3-

The foreign Office are of the opinion that it will probablybe necessary, therefore, to make sure that the Swedish Governmentare ready to connive at the transit of volunteers across Sweden,before any decision is taken to   facilitate or encourage theenrolment of such volunteers in this country07aQ       An Offficial Bureau would form a clearing house forall demands from Finland and for a(l enquiries and offers of assistance to Finland of whatever nature.      It would settle, by consultation with Government Departments,matters of policy and detail such as pay and conditions ofservice for volunteers, and would arrange for the necessary arms to be made available.     And it would necessarily include a section for recruiting purposes (with a separate office)which would be staffed by retired officers of recent armyexperience, responsible for recruiting, equipping anddespatching personnel, to form an organised unit or units on arrival in Finland.Sir George Macdonogh strongly supports an Official Bureauon these lines0     We must, however, point out that even if no steps to give publicity to such a Bureau are taken, the fact ofits existence   will inevitably leak out and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must be prepared to face enquiries as to its nature,standing and duties.8. An Unofficial Bureau (and Recruiting Office), whilefulfilling the functions detailed in paragraph 7a above, wouldostensibly have no connection with His Mn jestyJs governments    It would co-operate with the activities of all existing organisations, andwould be staffed by a whole time staff, the size of which couldonly be determined in the light of experience,      The cost of theorganisation would probably have to be borne by public funds,under some suitable camouflaged arrangement, and the Head of the unofficial Bureau would be given direct access to GovernmentDepartments, under an arrangement which would be notifiedconfidentially to them

Parallel to, and working in the closest connectionwith the unofficial Bureau itself, there would he a specialsection in the Office of the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence charged with the responsibility for dealing with questions of the supply of Government equipment (and ofService personnel if necessary) to Finland.9. It will he seen from the above that whichever formof Bureau is adopted, the results will be broadly the same.The point for decision, therefore, seems to be whether theWar Cabinet are prepared to co-operate openly in executionof the Resolution of the League of Nations (see paragraph 3)in giving assistance to Finland, or whether they would prefer to try to achieve the same end sub rosa.We are of opinion th Bureau should be set upimmediately, since many and complicated problems must be solved before our assistance can take a form other than the simple supply of equipment.      Sir George Macdonogh explained to us the importance of early action,  as Finnish civilian(as opposed to military) morale is suffering, and the earlyappearance of even a small body of volunteers from thiscountry may be expected to have an effect quite disproportionateto its size.10.       We, therefore, ask for a decision by the War Cabineton the following points:-(i)   Whether material assistance to Finland shall belimited as at present to the despatch of equipment or whether it should now be extended so as toinclude the despatch of volunteers (see paragraph 5above)(ii)    If volunteers are to be permitted, should the Bureauwhich will have to be set up, be official orunof f icial&amp;.(Intld.)

Aide-memoire communicated to Swedish Minister.His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French government having regard to the resolutions voted by the assembly and Council of the League of Nations regarding theassistance to be afforded to Finland against the attackmade upon her by the Soviet Union, are for their partdisposed to afford unofficially to Finland, for thedefence of her national independence,  all the indirectassistance in their power.The details of this assistance, which will in thenormal way take the form of the despatch of technicalmissions and the supply of material on credit or otherwise,are at present under examination.      In any case, however,it will be put into effect with all possible speed:    andthe two Governments in informing the Swedish Governmentof their action, trust that they will find them similarlydisposed to help Finland and ready to afford all necessary facilities for help from other sources.His Majesty1s Government and the French Governmentare indeed convinced that the fate of Finland could, in no circumstances be a matter of indifference to the swedish government, in view of the threat to the whole of NorthernScandinavia which the subjugation of Finland would involve;and they have no doubt that the Swedish and Norwegian Governments, while reserving to themselves the right totake, when necessary, such measures as their own interestsdemand, will be prepared to examine immediately, in a spirit of mutual solidarity, the situation prejudicial tothe interests of the Scandinavian community which hasalready arisen.      In this examination the attitude ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government will,of course, be an important consideration;    and they accordingly desire to assure the Swedish and Norwegian Governments that the preservation of the integrity and independence of Sweden and Norway, no less than that off inland&apos;s independence, constitutes in their view animportant element in European security.      They are there-fore prepared to consider in what circumstances and in what form an assurance could, in practice be given to sweden and Norway of Franco-British help against thepossible consequences to those countries of giving suchdirect or indirect assistance as the5 might afford to finland.Foreign Office,27th December,  1939.ANNEX

Memorandum communicated, &quot;by the Swedish Minister,tly Confidential. .The Royal Swedish Government have examined withthe greatest interest the communication received fromthe British and French Governments.      The swedish government fully share the views of the British andFrench Governments that the fate of Finland aannot be amatter of indifference to Sweden.      In fact, no other country could be more affected bj? the Soviet attack onFinland than Sweden.In view hereof, Sweden is endeavouring to assistFinland by all means in her power short of military intervention, v/hich has not been found compatible withthe exposed situation of the country.      In addition tohumanitarian aid, which Sweden has been giving and isgiving, Sweden has come to the financial assistance off inland in the form of funds collected from private persons, banks and companies.      These contributions havebeen very considerable, and only a minor part of their total amount has been brought to public knowledge.      Ofstill greater importance has been the fact that Swedenhas delivered to Finland considerable quantities of war materials,  the employment of which seems to have had,at least on some parts of the front, a decisive influence on the successful Finnish defence.      Material deliveredhas also included equipment for Swedish volunteers pro-ceedihg to Finland.      The material in question has beensent to such an extent that Sweden, in order to safe-guard   her own security, is now bound to endeavour toreplace this material from abroad with the utmost speed.In addition, the Swedish Government is endeavouring inevery way to strengthen its own defence forces.It is in these circumstances evident that theSwedish Government must welcome with great satisfactionthe fact that Finland is receiving from other sourcesthat assistance which seems absolutely necessary for continued successful defence.     Sweden is in consequencewilling to facilitate the supply to Finland of such material help as Great 3ritLin and France may be ready tofurnish or which may be forthcoming from other sources.In this connexion, the Swedish Govex^nment would, however,like to put forward some special considerations:-Collaboration between the two great Baltic Powersmay lead to such measures that effective assistance to finland may be prevented,  at least temporarily.      Suchconsequences may especially arise in case the measurescontemplated for the assistance to Finland were given insuch a way that it could be said with good reason either that Sweden was participating in a common international action against Soviet Russia under the auspices of theLeague of Nations, or that Sweden associated herself withan Allied action against that country.      An eventualcommon action by the two great Baltic Powers would,  inaddition to other consequences for Sweden herself, with

great probability lead to a speedy breaking down ofthe resistance of Finland, without,  as far as theSwedish Government can see,  the Powers outside theBaltic being able to prevent this.The Swedish Government would, in consequence,strongly recommend that assistance should be givenin such a way that Sweden would not appear to take part in an international action:,    that deliveries ofwar material be given the character of Finnishpurchases of war material from abroad;    and that thosetechnicians who are eventually considered necessary to accompany the war material in question be volunteersproceeding to Finland in a private capacity.      under such circumstances,  the Swedish Government is willingto facilitate as far as possible, and in every way,the transit to Finland and to organise the necessarytransport on application in each case from thatcountry.      The Swedish Government ventures speciallyto emphasise the necessity that no publication begiven to the assistance in question.The Sv/edish Government wish further to statethat they strongly hold the opinion that they bestfurther Finnish,  as well as cor.a-.ion European interests,by maintaining with firmness that policy of neutralitywhich tie Swedish Government declared on the outbreakof war on the 1st September,  1939.The Royal Swedish Government finally beg toexpress their appreciation not only of the valuable assistance to warring Finland promised in the communication from the two Powers, but also of theunderstanding therein shown with regard to theposition of Sweden.Swedish Legation in London,4th January,  1940.
