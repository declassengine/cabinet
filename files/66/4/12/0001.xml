I        this document is the property of his britannic-majestvs government 96Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1939.MOST SECRET. Copy No.    2 8W.P. (39) 162.TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.NORWAY-IRON-ORE TRAFFIC.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE effectual stoppage of the Norwegian ore supplies to Germany ranksas a major offensive operation of war. No other measure is open to us formany months to come which gives so good a chance of abridging the waste and destruction of the conflict, or of perhaps preventing the vast slaughters whichwill attend the grapple of the main armies.2. If the advantage is held to outweigh the obvious and serious objections,the whole process of stoppage must be enforced. The ore from Lulea, is alreadystopped by the winter&apos;s ice, which must not be broken by the Soviet ice-breaker,should it be attempted. The ore from Narvik must be stopped by layingsuccessively a series of small minefields in Norwegian territorial waters at thetwo or three suitable points on the coast, which will force the ships carrying-ore to Germany to quit territorial waters, and come on to the high seas, where,if German, they will be taken as prize, or, if neutral, subjected to our contraband control. The ore from Oxelosund, the main ice-free port in the Baltic, must also be prevented from leaving by methods which will be neither diplomatic normilitary. All these three ports must be dealt with in various appropriate waysas soon as possible.3.. Thus it is not a question of denying Germany a mere million tons between now and May, but of cutting off her whole winter supply except the negligibleamounts that can be got from Gavle, or other minor ice-free Baltic ports.Germany would therefore undergo a severe deprivation, tending to crisis beforethe summer. But when the ice melts in the Gulf of Bothnia the abundant supply from Lulea would again be open, and Germany is no doubt planning, not onlyto get as much as she can during the winter, but to make up the whole 9-J million tons which she needs, or even more, between the 1st May and the 15th December,1940. After this she might hope to organise Russian supplies and be able towage a very long war.4. It may well be that, should we reach the month of May with Germanystarving for ore for her industries and her munitions, the prevention of the[20491]
reopening of Lulea may become a principal Naval objective. The laying of adeclared minefield, including magnetic mines, off Lulea by British submarineswould be one way. There are others. If Germany can be cut from all Swedishore supplies from now onwards till the end of 1940, a blow will have been struckat her war-making capacity equal to a first-class victory in the field or from theair. and without any serious sacrifice of life. It might, indeed, be immediatelydecisive.5. To every blow struck in war there is a counter. If you fire at theenemy he wall fire back. It is most necessary, therefore, to face squarely the counter-measures which may be taken by Germany, or constrained by her from norway or Sweden. As to Norway there are three pairs of events which arelinked together. First, the Germans, conducting war in a cruel and lawlessmanner, have violated the territorial waters of Norway, sinking without warningor succour a number of British and neutral vessels. To that our response isto lay the minefields mentioned above. It is suggested that Norway, by way of protest, may cancel the valuable agreement we have made with her for charteringher tankers and other shipping. But then she would lose the.extremely profitablebargain she has made with us, and this shipping would become valueless to herin view of our contraband control. Her ships would be idle, and her ownersimpoverished. It would not be in Norwegian interests for her Government totake this step; and interest is a powerful factor. Thirdly, Norway could retaliateby refusing to export to us the aluminium and other war materials which are important to the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Supply. But here againher interests&apos;would suffer. Not only would she not receive the valuable gainswhich this trade brings her, but Great Britain, by denying her Bauxite andother indispensable raw materials, could bring the whole industry of Norway,centring upon Oslo and Bergen, to a complete standstill. . In short, Norway, byretaliating against us, would be involved in economic and industrial ruin.6. Norwegian sympathies are on our side, and her future independencefrom German over-lordship hangs upon the victory of the Allies. It is notreasonable to suppose that she will take either of the counter-measures mentionedabove (although she may threaten them), unless she is forced to do so by Germanbrute force.7. This will certainly be applied to her anyway, and whatever we do, if germany thinks it her interest to dominate forcibly the Scandinavian peninsula.In that case the war would spread to Norway and Sweden, and with our com-mand of the seas there is no reason why French and British troops should not meet German invaders on Scandinavian soil. At any rate, we can certainly takeand hold whatever islands or suitable points on the Norwegian coast we choose.Our northern blockade of Germany would then become absolute. We could, forinstance, occupy Narvik and Bergen, and keep them open for our own trade whileclosing them completely to Germany. It cannot be too strongly emphasised thatBritish control of the Norwegian coast-line is a strategic objective of first-class importance. It is not, therefore, seen how, even if retaliation by Germany wereto run its full course, we should be worse off for the action now proposed. Onthe contrary, we have more to gain than lose by a German attack upon Norwayor Sweden.   This point is capable of more elaboration than is necessary here.There is no reason why we should not manage to secure a large and long-continued supply of iron-ore from Sweden through Narvik while at the same timediverting all supplies of ore from Germany.   This must be our aim.8. The effect of our action against Norway upon world opinion and upon our own reputation must be considered. We have taken up arms in accordancewith the principles of the Covenant of the League in order to aid the victims of German aggression. No technical infringement of International Law, solong as it is unaccompanied by inhumanity of any kind, can deprive us of thegood wishes of neutral countries. No evil effect will be produced upon thegreatest of all neutrals, the United States. We have reason to believe that theywill handle the matter in the way most calculated to help us. And they arevery resourceful.
9. The final tribunal is our own conscience. We are fighting to re-establish the reign of law and to protect the liberties of small countries. Our defeat wouldmean an age of barbaric violence, and would&apos; be fatal not only to ourselves, butto the independent life of every small country in Europe. Acting in the name ofthe Covenant, and as virtual mandatories of the League and all it stands for,we have a right, and, indeed, are bound in duty, to abrogate for a space someof the Conventions of the very laws we seek to consolidate and reaffirm. Smallnations must not tie our hands when we are fighting for their rights and freedom.The letter of the law must not in supreme emergency obstruct those who are changed with its protection and enforcement. It would not be right or rationalthat the Aggressor Power should gain one set of advantages by tearing up alllaws, and another set by sheltering behind the innate respect for law of their opponents.   Humanity, rather than legality, must be our guide.W. S. C.December 16. 1939.
