this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.J C R E T.Lp.(40) 13.WAR OABIMET.DESPATCH OP FORGES TO NORWEGIAN PCRTS.Memorandum by the War Office.1.       At the meeting of the War Cabinet on 3rd January,the Secretary of State for War was requested,, inconsultation with his Service colleagues and the Ministerof Shipping, to arrange for the preparation of detailed plans for the oceupation of Stavanger, Bergen, and Trondheimand to submit a report as soon   as possible, showing:-(a) What would be icanediately involved and(b) What might be involved at a subsequent date,in the above operations.In particular, an early report was requested as the earliest late on which the forces could &quot;be ready to sail.2.       The plans for the despatch *f the military ferceswhich will be immediately involved, are now suffiently advanced for the War Office to be able to inform  he War Cabinetregarding these forces and the date by which they could be despatched.3.       The following force would be required:-Force Headquarters and Signals.Five infantry battalions.One Field Company, Royal Engineers.Ancillary personnel.The total strength of &quot;the above force is some 3,500men of whom approximately 3,200 are infantry.

4. The role of-the force would.tee to deny to the enemy theuse of the naval and air facilities at Bergen, Stavanger, andTrondhe im.5. The following would he the general initial-dispositions:-( H.Q. Force.Bergen   I Two infantry battalions.( Small detachment Royal Engineers.( Two infantry battalions.Stavanger (Detachment Royal Engineers.Trondheim One infantry battalion.6. Detailed arrangements regarding the despatch of theForce are being made by the War Office in conjunction with thedepartments concerned.      If the decision to despatch the force were taken at any time prior to noon on 15th January, theearliest time by which the force for Stavanger could heembarked ready to leave the United Kingdom is the evening of16th January.      The remainder could he embarked -ready to leave &apos;the United Kingdom by the evening of 17th January.The holding of a certain amount ef rolling stock isnecessary so long as the force remains at such short notice tomove.7. It must be emphasised that it is not possible to send anyvehicles with the force and that the administrative services have had to be reduced to a bare minimum.     At each destinationreliance is being placed upon the possibility of billeting, ofmaking local purchases, of hiring transport, and of usingNorwegian hospital accommodation.      Once the force has landed itwill therefore be able to carry out its rale only if assured, ofthe continual co-operation of the local civil and militaryauthorities.Finally it must be realised that no part of the force is organised to effect a landing against opposition.   ...

SUBSEQUENT IMPLICATIONS..8. There remains the question of what might be involved at a subsequent date in these operati line.      the size of the forces to be sent initially to each of the threeports is governed largely by the scale of enemy attack whichit is estimated might be brought against them under theclimatic conditions which are likely to prevail between now and the spring.      When,however, weather conditions and the melting of the snow make free movement possible, these forces will be inadequate to carry out the role now allotted.      Forexample, larger areas will become exposed to parachutelandings.      On the information at our disposal it is notpossible to make an accurate forecast of the &quot;additionaltroops that would be required, but it is likely to be ofthe order of an extra one or possibly two battalions at each port.      Moreover, complete reliance could not continueto be placed upon locally provided transport.      In order to&quot;possess the neoessary tactical mobility units would require a certain number of military vehicles.9. By undertaking these operations in Norway we mightplace Sweden in the position of having to declare herselffor the Germans or for the Allies.      If she declared herselffor the Allies we ought, both on moral grounds and in ourown interests,  to undertake the major operation outlined in W.P.(39) 180;     in this case Trondheim would assumegreat importance as a base.      If Sweden declared herselffor Germany, it is possible that the situation of our forces at the three ports might become untenable.      Themost they might achieve would be to do as much damage tothe aerodromes as possible before being withdrawn.

1. January, 1940.OTHER CONSIDERATIONS WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO AN INCREASEDCOMMITMENT.10.       It may also prove desirable at a later date tomake certain changes in the role of the forces, and thesepossible changes, though not strictly relevant to thepresent operations, should be taken into consideration.The changes might be:-(a)    The aerodrome at Stavanger may be required foruse by the R.A.P. as distinct from preventing its use by the enemy.      Since this would entailcontrolling a considerably larger area of countrythan is requir-ed merely to deny the aerodrome tothe enemy, the force at this point would have to beincreased, the extent of the increase dependingupon the circumstances at the time.     Moreover,a considerable organisation would be required.(b) The laying of the Northern Barrage may involve an addition to the role of the force at Bergen.Until the Chiefs of Staff have examined the full implications of this project, it is not possibleto estimate what demands may be made on the army for this purpose.(c) We might have to yield to the strong pressure which Norway would be likely to put on us toincrease the Allied forces supporting.her againstthe danger of German attack.
