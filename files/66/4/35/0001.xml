COPY N0.-..-&apos;:TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET,W.P.(40)  5.(Also Paper No.C.O.S.(40)1847WAR    CABINET *SCANDINAVIA.REPORT BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.The War Cabinet,  at their meeting on 2nd January,194CS:-&quot; i) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to give further consideration at once toparas.  79-85^ in the light of thediscussion which had taken place,with a view to defining more precisely:-( a)  the military consequences of aGerman occupation of southern norway.(b)  the steps which might be taken to obviate these consequences (e.g. byforestalling the Germans) or atleast to mitigate them.112. It is generally agreed that,  if we took actionagainst the export of iron   ore from Narvik, the germans might counter by establishing naval and air bases in southern Norway.      There are good aerodromes at Oslo,christians and, Stavanger, and smaller ones at Bergen andTrondheim.      The last four places are also suitable foruse as advanced naval bases.      Seaplane bases also exist in these local iti s, and facilities for operating seaplanescould be quickly improvised at many other points on theNorwegian coast.K W.M.(40) 1st Conclusions, Minute 1.0 Paper No. W,P,(39)  179.

3. The military consequences of the Germansestablishing themselves in Southern Norway were stated inparagraph 79 of our previous Report, but we elaboratethem as follows:-(a) Scapa and the Shetlands are only 250 miles fromStavanger, as compared with nearly 600 miles fromGermany.      The distance from Oslo to the Shetlands isnot very much greater, but aircraft would have to cross the mountains in Norway on each flight - a factor whichwould reduce the scale of operations over the North Sea,particularly in bad weather,,     Nevertheless the scale of air attack on our northern naval bases, and on our naval forces and shipping in northern waters, would bemuch increased.(b) German submarines could refuel and refresh on theNorwegian coast, instead of returning to Germany, butthere would be no substantial advantage to them in thisuntil our Northern Barrage had been laid - and then only if they had the use of Bergen or other harbours on thecoast to the northward.( c) When we have laid the Northern Barrage,  itsefficacy would be greatly reduced if the Germans held the Norwegian coast, on which its farther end must rest.They would be able to keep clear a swept channel, or even to prevent us laying mines   right up to the coast.(d) The possession by the enemy of bases in southern norway would facilitate both their naval and air operations. against the Norwegian convoys to the British Islesuntil the Northern Mine Barrage becomes effective.After the Barrage had become effective, naval operations against the Norwegian convoys would be extremely difficult.fS W.P.

4* In considering the steps which might he taken-fro -obviate these consequences or at least to mitigate them,it is necessary to take into account the probable Germanaction both in establishing bases and subsequentlymaintaining them.     We assume at the outset that, unlessthe Norwegian Government have previously invited us,  therecan be no question of forestalling the Germans byoccupying Norwegian territory before au invasion by them has started.5-. It will be convenient to consider each portseparately.Oslo.6* The Germans could carry out an o^eratioii on theAlbanian model,  i.e.  appearing off Oslo unheralded withwarships and transports covered by bombers.      The passagecould be done in the night.      The Norwegians would beunlilcaly no.--pwt. ug^ any-re_si-s-tan.ee.      All we could do would be to strengthen our submarine patrols in theKattegat and Skagerrack,  and to have them in position -and.,ready to--act before there was any likelihood of theGerman invasion being-made^.. J...sdjmltanecaasly with our     *taking action against the Narvik trafficw      It must be emphasised, however,  that it is very doubtful whether these patrols would be able to effect very much.      In thefirst place the movement of the transports would probablybe carried out by night, and our submarines would have great difficulty in sighting the German ships.      Moreovereven if they saw them they would have no means of knowingthat they were transports and not ordinary merchantmen,which they would not be permitted to sink at sight.

christians and,7. The landing at this port might take the same frrmas at Oslo5  or it might be done by air-borne troops.      Inneither event is the Norwegian defence likely to be effective, though tliey might put up some resistance toparachute troops, especially if we warned them to guard against that type of attack.8c Our own counter-action to a sea-borne attack wouldbe subject to the same limitations as in the case of Oslo.There would be no possibility of sending a force to try and forestall the enemy, as, even if this were possible,its subsequent maintenance would be too difficult.Stavanger.,9. The Germans would be less likely to undertake arsea-borne expedition to Stavanger in view of its liability to interruption by our naval forces.,    Stavanger, however,would be an important phje-ctive for the Germans, as it hasa good aerodrome and is in the best strategical positionff^r their purposeo      They might therefore send air-bornetrpops to seize itc10-. If the Germans attempt this operation at the outset, we cannot possibly forestall them,,    It is, however,possible r.hat they might postpone it until they had established themselves at the ports more accessible tothemo     We should therefore be prepared to take advantageof this possibility by despatching a small force in awarship to Stavanger the moment we hear that a german invasion of Norway has started.    If the force arrives intime, well and good.      If not, there would be no questionof attempting an opposed landing, and it would return,,

Bergen and Trondheinulie        These two ports can conveniently be consideredtogethero    A German sea-borne invasion of either portin the early stages is extremely improbable and an air-borne expedition scarcely less so, owing to theranges involved, the lack of adequate aerodromes andthe hazards of subsequent maintenanceo    Once however the Germans had obtained a firm footing in Norway,  theywould reach out to the northward and develop thesebases if they were allowed to do so.     Ve should thereforeoccupy these two places at the earliest possible moment with small forces of sufficient strength to deny them to the enemy0Preparation of Forceso12p        The forces destined for    Stavanger, Bergen andTrondheim together with the necessary shipping mustbe held in readiness for instant despatch from themoment that we take action to stop the Narvik oretrafficoPossible Subsequent Actiono13o        It will be seen from the above that we can dolittle or nothing to prevent an initial german occupation of Oslo and Ohristiansando    Vfe might be ableto anticipate them at Stavanger, and we should hope to succeed in doing so at Bergen and Trondheim,    As toour subsequent action,  the forces the Germans wouldemploy would be comparatively small, and consequently the quantity of shipping required to maintain them would not be-largeo    Maintenance could be carried outentirely through Oslo and Ohristiansand, the vesselssailing by night, and there is little we could do to interrupt ito

CONCLUSIONS a14o        To sum up, we said in paragraph 85 of our previous Report that the military consequences of aGerman occupation of bases in Southern Norway would be gravely to compromise our naval control in the NorthSea0     The further consideration that we have given tothe problem, the result of which is set out above, doesnot lead us to alter our opinion0     On the other hand,should we obtain possession of Bergen and the coastto the northward, although the increased air menace to our fleet bases and naval forces and shipping in thenorthern part of the North Sea would remain, neverthelessas a set-off to this we should be able to make theNorthern Mine Barrage effective right up to the Norwegiancoasto     This would not only increase the effectiveness of our Contraband Control but also provide increasedsecurity for our Northern Patrol both from surface ships and submarineso150       If the issue at stake were the cutting off ofa mere three quarters of a million tons of ore fromGermany, we could not recommend at the present time theacceptance of military consequences, which, until theNorthern Barrage becomes effective, are entirely to our disadvantage^      If, on the other hand, the War cabinet are satisfied that the stoppage of the ore from Narvik,so far from prejudicing the project for the complete stoppage of Swedish ore, is likely to facilitate it, adifferent complexion is put upon the matter,,16e       There is an important point to which we desirein conclusion to invite attention,,     Interference withthe iron ore traffic from Narvik will almost inevitably

attract Gersaan attention, to the whole problem of swedish iron ore, and in particular to the possibilityof our landing a force at Narvik to seize the Gallivaremines.     The Germans cannot establish themselves inNorthern Sweden until after the snow melts , but it willbe open to them to sabotage the railway between Narvikand Gallivare, and thus frustrate our designs.     In the face of this threat we feel that pressure may be put upon us to land a force at Narvik at the earliestpossible date, in order to -jeize the mines and therailway before the latter can be wrecked.     We desire toemphasise that the end of March is the very earlies-td^ttd&apos;lay-opi^^ -feb-isoperation.(Signed)      C.L.N.
