NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.THE outstanding naval event of the week under review has been the actionbetween H.M. Ships Exeter, A jaw and Achilles and the German pocket battleshipAdmiral Graf Spee off Montevideo on the 13th December. Details of this action,so far as known, are given in a. subsequent section.The first convoy of Canadian troops has left Halifax escorted and covered bystrong naval forces, and a military convoy from Bombay is also on passage.In addition to reporting the return of the German S.S. Bremen to Germanwaters, H.M. Submarine Salmon has been responsible for sinking a U-boat andtorpedoing a cruiser of the &quot; Leipzig &quot; class.The armed merchant cruisers have been replaced on the Northern Patrol by8-inch and 6-inch cruisers. Bad weather and continuous gales have again throwna heavy strain on our light forces and a number of these ships are now in processof repair, enabling the personnel to obtain a measure of relief from their duties.Enemy minelaying off the East Coast continues, but has not seriously curtailedthe movements of our ships up and down this coast.Home Waters.2. During the week under review units of the Home Fleet were employedin covering the outward and homeward-bound Norwegian convoys, which arrivedwithout incident. Very heavy weather, however, considerably delayed the passageof the homeward-bound convoy.A large force of destroyers carried out an anti-submarine sweep to the dutch coast on the 11th December, in co-operation with air forces, but no enemy ships were encountered.3. H.M. Submarine Salmon reported that on the 4th December she sank an outward-bound U-boat 75 miles S.W. of the Lister Light (southern point of norway). No further details will be forthcoming until H.M. Submarine Salmonreturns to her base.She also reported on the 12th December that the German merchant shipBremen had passed her within torpedo range, screened by aircraft, but that she had withheld her fire in accordance with the international rules of submarine warfare.4. H.M.S. Duchess (a destroyer of 1.375 tons) was in collision with H.M.S.Bar ham in the early morning of the 12th December and was sunk with heavy casualties, 6 officers and 123 men being lost.5. During the forenoon of Wednesday, the 13th December, our recon-naissance aircraft reported sighting enemy destroyers 120 miles west of Jutland.Later in the day a report was received from H.M. Submarine Salmon that she had sighted an enemy force consisting of two pocket battleships, two 8-inchgun cruisers and two 5-9-inch gun cruisers steering west, and had attacked bytorpedo one cruiser of the &quot; Leipzig class; but owing to her being subsequentlyattacked by depth charges it was impossible for her to make an earlier report.On the strength of this information the northern patrol areas have been reinforcedand additional units have been disposed to strengthen the covering forces forthe Canadian convoy crossing the Atlantic. All available submarines took upstrategic positions to intercept, and destroyers were ordered to sweep and patrolstated areas in the North Sea. The Germans have since announced that one oftheir cruisers sustained damage.Extensive air reconnaissance has been carried out since&apos; daylight on the14th, and ten aircraft which were sent out in the afternoon sighted one battleship,one cruiser and three destroyers in the neighbourhood of Heligoland. enemy aircraft, in force prevented an attack being made on these ships..6. H.M. Destroyer Kelly struck a mine on the 14th December off the entrance of the Tyne. No casualties are reported and she has proceeded intoport with tugs in attendance.
Foreign Waters.7. H.M.S. Ajaai, flying the broad pennant of the Commodore of the south american Division, reported sighting one pocket battleship 31)0 miles east ofMontevideo, steering towards the coast, at about 6 a.m. on the 13th December.Two hours later the Commodore reported that his squadron, consisting of one8-inch gun Cruiser (H.M.S. Exeter) and two 6-inch gun Cruisers (H.M.S. Ajcuvand Achilles) had been heavily engaged. H.M.S. Exeter had suffered considerablematerial damage, having only one gun in action when she was forced to drop outof the fight, and in consequence she had been directed to return to the falkland islands.The remainder of the squadron continued the engagement in pursuit of theenemy, who made for the River Plate, and eventually anchored in the Roads offMontevideo at midnight, where she was identified as the Admiral Graf Spee.(This class of ship mounts six 11-inch guns.)An authorised spokesman from the German Ministry at Uruguay reportsthat the Admiral Graf Spec had 36 killed and 60 wounded, and press telegramsindicate that the ship is considerably damaged. The British Staff C*officer(Intelligence), Montevideo, reports that she has suffered the following externaldamage: Starboard pair A/A guns damaged.One searchlight damaged.Rangefinder and control tower damaged.Aircraft wrecked.Large hole in hull, port side mess deck.Other minor holes.He estimated that fifty to sixty hits were obtained.The British squadron is guarding the exit from the River Plate, and hasalready been strongly reinforced.It is reported that the A admiral Graf Spec had on board six British merchantcaptains whose ships were captured off the South African and South Americancoasts. These ships are probably the Newton Beech, Huntsman, Trevanion andAshlea, referred to in last week&apos;s Resume, and the Africa Shell and Doric Star,which are known to have been sunk. The accompanying map shows what isthought to have been the Admiral Graf Spee&apos;s cruise since the end of September.8. On the 9th December HALS. Sussex and Shropshire captured the GermanS.S. Adolf Leonhardt (2,989 tons) off the Portuguese West African coast. Effortswere made to save her from being scuttled, but eventually she had to be sunk by gunfire.  Six officers and nineteen of her crew were rescued by H.M.S. Shropshire.Protection of British Seaborne Trade.9. The number of vessels convoyed on twelve routes during the week ending the 13th December was as follows : &apos;British       ...      ...      .........      ......      419Allied............      .........        24Neutral      ............      ...      ...       ... 1444The total number of ships convoyed up to the 13th December was 4,705.Two ships were lost in convoy during the week under review, and ten havebeen lost since the beginning of the war.   This gives a percentage loss of;    one:fifth of 1 per cent.10. The following forces have been employed on escort duty during theweek : 3 Battleships.1 Aircraft Carrier.5 Cruisers.6 Armed Merchant Cruisers.41 Destroyers.13 Escort Vessels.2 Submarines.In addition four French contre-torpilleurs and four submarines.[20485] &apos; b 2
Anti-Submarine Operations.11. During the week under review eight attacks have been carried out by-destroyers, escort vessels and anti-submarine trawlers, and two attacks were madeby French patrols.Although two or more TJ-Boats have probably been operating in the western approaches, only two ships have been sunk there during the week. One of these,S.S. Brandon, was in convoy, and the air and destroyer escort attacked the U-Boat,but no definite result is claimed.Off the north coast of Scotland an aircraft on patrol sighted a U-Boat on the surface, and carried out attacks which may have caused damage.On the 11th December anti-submarine trawlers made three attacks on aU-Boat located near Plymouth Sound.There are now 127 auxiliary anti-submarine trawlers converted and in commission, of which ten are working up at Portland. Fourteen more areexpected to complete before the end of the year.Of the 31 anti-submarine Yachts, six are now fitted with asdics and twelveare in process of being fitted.German Minelaying.12. Between 9 p.m. on the 7th December and 1 a.m. on the 8th Decemberthere were twelve raids by low-flying aircraft between Lowestoft and the thames Estuary. One aircraft flew low over Harwich harbour and droppedmines in the entrance, in consequence of which the harbour was closed to shipping.Sweeping was carried out for magnetic mines without result and the port wasreopened on the 10th instant. Owing to bad weather, there was little furtherenemy air activity until the 10th December, when mine dropping was reportedoff Newcastle and Hartlepool. HALS. Griffin observed two parachutes being dropped in the Thames Estuary and nine mines were reported to have been dropped off St. Abb&apos;s Head.13. A mine detonated alongside H.M. Drifter Ray of Hope on the10th December in the Thames Estuary, when she was trying to recover it with her nets, and the ship was sunk with the loss of nine killed. A magnetic minewas exploded off the entrance to Loch Ewe on the same day. Some damage wassustained to minesweeping gear. The first standing patrol over enemy seaplanebases at Borkum and Sylt was carried out on the 12th. The object of thesepatrols is to attack enemy aircraft which are responsible for mine laying.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.14. The British ship Eskdene reported in last weelds Resume was broughtsafely into the Tyne with her cargo of timber. The Danish ship Ove Toft,reported last week to have been sunk by mine, is now reported from Copenhagento have been torpedoed.15. During the week sixteen Allied and Neutral vessels have been lostdue to enemy action. The British loss amounts to approximately 30,000 tons,and it is worth noting that three out of four of the British ships torpedoedwere in ballast and two of the five British ships sunk by mines were under1,000 tons. It is possible that the Dutch ship Immingham struck a mine inthe Dutch defensive minefield; otherwise the losses from mines are restricted toa comparatively limited area on the S.E. Coast. Details of losses are given inAppendix I.16. It is also reported that the Admiral Graf Spee sank the british.S. Tairoa (7,983 tons) on the 3rd December, which sailed from Durban on the28th November, and S.S. Streonshalh (3,895 tons) on the 7th December, whichsailed from Montevideo on the 26th November.The total number of British, Allied and Neutral ships lost up to the presentamounts to 172 ships of 846,910 gross tons. Further details are given inAppendix II.
The average rate of sinkings per week for fourteen weeks of war is 11-8ships per week and approximately 44,500 tons. Charts showing British. allied and Neutral shipping losses during each week of the war to date, and british shipping losses are appended.Losses by Hazard.17. On the 7th December S.S. Whinton, 733 tons, was sunk off Cromer in collision with H.M. Trawler Leo, which was seriously damaged. All the crew were saved. On the 9th December S.S. Middlesbrough, 989 tons, struck a submergedobject (probably the wreck of S.S. Goodwood) off Flamborough Head and sank.Tlie crew were saved by the Icelandic ship Ruenborg. On the 10th DecemberS.S. Fireking, 758 tons&apos;, was sunk after colliding with S.S. Duke of Lancaster(Belfast mail boat) in Liverpool Bay.   Crew and passengers are reported safe.Additions to British Mercantile Ocean-Going Tonnage.18. During the week one new ship of 10.000 tons has been commissioned,and one tanker of 2,000 tons employed on the Great Lakes has been adapted forOcean Trade.The average weekly increment of British ships and tonnage over fourteenweeks has been approximately five ships and 24,000 gross tons. Compared withthis the average weekly loss of British ships and tonnage for the same periodhas been approximately seven ships and 30,000 tons.Vessels now under construction include ten tankers of 66,000 tons .andone hundred and thirty other vessels of 729,000 tons.Economic Warfare.British Contraband Control,19. Cargo seized in prize this week totalled 7,050 tons, of which the main items were, ores and metals 550 tons, non-metallic products 750 tons, oil seeds800 tons, food-stuffs and beverages 1,200 tons, feeding-stuffs 900 tons and cotton1,450 tons. The Italians, who continue to complain of the delays to their shipping, have shown more signs of impatience since the control of german exports was announced. They complain particularly of the delays attendant onthe examination of mails. A Contraband Control Station for enemy exports tothe East is being opened at Aden on the 15th December, which will work inconjunction with Port Said, under the Commander-in-chief, East Indies.French Contraband Control.20. Figures so far available for the French service show that up to the2nd December a total of 260,000 tons had been seized. During the fortnight ending on that date 45,000 tons were detained, of which 18,148 tons werefood-stuffs, 12,651 tons metals and ores, 2,236 tons textiles and 583 tons wine.German Contraband Control.21. It is understood that the German Control Station at Kiel contained40 Swedish, 27 Finnish and 13 Norwegian ships under detention at the end ofNovember. German trawlers and destroyers are operating against Danish foodships. Three Danish ships loaded with food-stuffs for England were interceptedoff the south-west of Denmark between the 6th and 9th December and taken intoa German port.German merchant shipping.22. S.S. Poseidon, 5,864 tons, reported as captured on the 25th October, isnow reported to have been scuttled off Iceland about the 27th October. &apos; Accordingto the latest information, there are 243 German merchantmen in foreign ports.
MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.23. There has been considerable enemy activity on the Rhine-Moselle frontthroughout the week. Patrols and local attacks, possibly with a view to ascertaining the sector held by British troops, have been a nightly feature. Inaddition, the enemy has made several determined attacks in the Forbach Salient,all of which were driven back.Some enemy activity has also taken place on the Rhine front, which hashitherto been extremely quiet. Small-arms fire from across the river was directedon French casemates and, on one occasion, a French post was machine-gunned bya German aircraft.24. There have been signs of enemy movement immediately behind the frontline in the Nied Valley area. Reliable information is not yet available, but themoves may have been due to the periodical relief of units holding this particularsector of the Saar front. Some movement of troops has also been reported atAachen and Erkelenz, and also in the area immediately adjoining theLuxemburg frontier.   Details are not yet known.Germany.Civilian morale.25. Contradictory reports of the state of civilian morale in Germany arestill being received and it is difficult to assess the situation accurately. Thedisaffection described in the Press is almost certainly much exaggerated, and itis suggested that the enemy may be deliberately spreading reports of the bad stateof morale in Germany in the hope that the Allies will believe that a collapse isimminent, and so consider it unnecessary to make their full war effort.Semi-military forces.26. In August 1939 the strength of the S.S. troops, whose primary dutyis to ensure internal security, was believed to be 200,000 men, of whom about half were permanently embodied.These permanently embodied S.S. units were organised, trained and equippedas the regular motorised infantry of the German Army and provided with thestandard armament of infantrj&apos;. With the addition of artillery and the necessaryancillary services, they would therefore form the equivalent of three motoriseddivisions and could be used side by side with Army formations in the field. the personnel, however, include the most loyal supporters of the present regime andtheir future employment will probably depend on the state of the home front andthe intentions of Herr Himmler, their powerful chief, who also controls theuniformed police and the Gestapo.The military leaders can scarcely view the expansion of the S.S. forces with pleasure, for the latter are steadily assuming the proportions of a privatearmy and may become a threat to the privileged position of the Regular Army, towhich Hitler gave the promise that it should be the only armed force in thecountry.Herr Himmler seems to have overcome the difficulty of equipping his privatearmy by seizing a big share of the Polish spoils from under the noses of themilitary authorities, an action which will not increase his popularity with the generals.Russia.27. A large proportion of the Soviet forces in Poland appear to have been withdrawn; indeed, one report states that there are now only fifteen divisions left in the whole country. Although this is probably an exaggeration, considerablewithdrawals have certainly taken place: for instance, three divisions, formerlybelieved to be in Poland, have been reported on the Finnish frontier.There have also been reports of the transfer of troops from the Far East to europe, but the significance of this movement cannot be assessed on the informa-tion at present available.
Italy.28. In accordance with the terms of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938,arrangements are being made to exchange military information during january 1940. Since the official publication of the strength of the Italian army at the end of November no subsequent reductions have been reported in Italy.Repatriations from Libya now total about 21,000 men, and are in accordance withthe general reduction of the Metropolitan Army to a strength of 868.000.A competent observer, who has frequent occasion for contact with the italian army, considers that the Italian mentality has, hitherto, been satisfied with the mere counting of heads rather than the intensive training of men called to arms,and that this, coupled with the lack of modern equipment (especially artillery),makes the general standard low. Nevertheless, the fighting efficiency of selectedbodies, such as the Alpini and Bersaglieri, should not be underestimated.Balkan States and Turkey.29. It is reported that Greek units on the Bulgarian frontier are beingreinforced by troops drawn from Western Greece. There is no indication,however, that the strength of the Greek Army is being increased.In Bulgaria, the 1938 class of recruit, Avhich had been retained with thecolours for an extra three months, is now being released, and the untrained menwho were called up for service in October will probably be released at Christmas,thereby reducing the army to its normal winter strength of about 70,000. It isexpected, however, that the 1940 class will be called up earlier than usual in theNew Year and that the strength will have risen to 110,000 by February. It maybe noted that the normal date for calling up the 1940 class of recruits has alreadybeen anticipated in Roumania and Turkey.Far East.30. Information about the military situation in Southern China is confused,but no appreciable change appears to have taken place at Nanning. Japanesereinforcements may, possibly, be on their way to extend operations in this area.AIR SITUATION.Home and North Sea Area.31. No German bombing attacks have been carried out during the past week.On the 7th December seven Heinkel Ills belonging to a bomber unit normallylocated near Hamburg were intercepted off the Scottish Coast, and although noaircraft were immediately shot down, it is almost certain that two bombers failedto return home. Enemy aircraft were active at night on various points off theEast Coast on the 7th and 11th instant. Fighter patrols were sent up on bothoccasions to try and make contact, but owing to the bad weather conditions andthe great difficulty of picking up enemy aircraft at night, no interceptions weremade. During the week the experiment was tried of maintaining a standing-patrol of Whitley aircraft over the German seaplane bases during the hours ofdarkness with the object of interfering with their mine-laying activities. bombs were dropped at Hornum and Borkum on various lights on the water whichwere believed to be connected with the operations of seaplanes. The immediateresults could not be. ascertained and it is too early yet to assess the value of such operations in reducing minelaying activities. It is, however, encouraging to note that our aircraft all returned safely in spite of being subjected to heavy a.A. fire at low altitudes, and that no interference from fighters was experienced.32. In addition to carrying out the usual heavy programme of convoy andother routine patrols, Coastal Command provided some fifty special patrols. Inthe course of these, two attacks were made upon enemy submarines, of which one was almost certainly successful. This took place 85 miles north-west of CapeWrath on the Sth of December, when two bombs were dropped upon a submarinethat was on the point of diving. After the second bomb the submarine surfacedapparently out of control. The bows then rose out of the water until thesubmarine assumed an angle of some 70 degrees, when she disappeared fromview stern first.
33. On the 13th December aircraft of Coastal Command located eight destroyers in a position approximately 128 miles S.W. of the Lister Light.A bombing attack was made, but a hit was not obtained. About the same timeanother patrol of three Hudsons attacked two enemy flying boats in the same area. Both enemy aircraft were damaged by machine-gun fire and their reargunners hit, but they then entered clouds and the final result of the combat couldnot be ascertained. There is little doubt that this surface and air activity wasconnected with the operations of the German pocket battleships and cruiserswhich were engaged by H.M. Submarine Salmon at approximately the sametime.   This force was not sighted by our aircraft patrols.34. Two reconnaissances in force by bomber aircraft wei&apos;e arranged for the14th December in order to locate and attack any German heavy ships found return-ing to Wilhelmshaven or Brunsbuttel. The intention was to send one force tosweep the area in the North Sea, up to Danish Territorial Waters, which might con-tain the damaged cruiser if she was being towed at slow speed. For this purpose a force of twenty-four Hampdens from Nos. 50 and 44 Squadrons were given orders to stand by from 8 a.m. on the 14th. At the same time arrangements were madeto send a force of forty-eight Wellingtons to sweep the area further south,including the estuaries on the north-west coast of Germany, in order to attack anywarships found in that area. This second operation was contingent upon weather conditions being such as would permit a high-level bombing attack. Theremainder of the bomber force was standing by to support attacks made by thesestriking forces and to provide a. force behind the searches carried out by coastal command in the North Sea, to the north and to the west of Scotland.35. On the morning of the 14th December the weather was bad, visibilitylow; there were thick clouds down to about 800 feet, and conditions generallywere most unsuitable for the attack of ships at sea. The two striking forces ofHampdens, of twelve aircraft each, took off at 8 a.m. and swept out respectively,one to the Horns Reef and then forty miles due south before returning to base, andthe other to a position 56Q N., 7Q 40&apos;&apos; E., and then due south before returning.These two striking forces encountered no enemy ships or opposition. One Flakship near the Danish coast opened fire with machine guns, but no action was taken against this.36. In the hope of the weather improving, the forty-eight Wellingtons were held until 11-45 a.m. There seemed no chance of clouds lifting, and, since theforce had strict injunctions not to enter the Jade-Weser Estuary unless it could reach some 8,000-12,000 feet to carry out a high attack, and as it was consideredthat the damaged cruiser had probably arrived at Wilhelmshaven orBrunsbuttel, the force was cut down to twelve Wellingtons of No. 99 Squadron,which took off at this time. They were routed out to the north of Heligoland andapproached Wilhelmshaven from a northerly direction.37. Just off the Jade Estuary, in position 54&quot; N., 8C E., the force observedone battleship and one cruiser, with some destroyers, steering 180o. weather conditions were most unfavourable the cloud ceiling about 1,000 feet or less.On account of this and the position of the ships no attack was carried out.Four minutes later the Wellingtons were attacked in force by enemy fighters in all some twenty Messerschmidts. Our force was proceeding on a westerly coursejust north of the Friesian Islands, and during a running fight which lasted forty-five minutes four Messerschmidts were shot down, two inflames, while we. sustainedthe loss of one Wellington shot clown by anti-aircraft fire. Two Wellingtonscollided during the fight and were lost. Two further aircraft are missing. our losses in this engagement were thus five, of which three only were from enemy action.France and Germany.38. There is little to report on the Western Front, where weather conditions have been extremely adverse. Early in the week German reconnaissance aircraft were reported over south-east and north-west France. A limited number of patrols have been carried out by fighters on both the French and British fronts,but no combats have been reported.
nRUSSO-FINNISH HOSTILITIES.Situation at sea.39. The Russian troops which occupied Hogland are reported to befortifying the island, apparently with the purpose of creating a new base forsea-borne attacks on the southern coast of Finland, where several landings havealready been attempted without success. Preparations for further landing-operations are also being hastened so that action can be taken before the ice setsin near the shore.   Freezing may be expected within the next fortnight.The Finnish coastal battery at Koivisto has been engaging units of theRussian Fleet, and an explosion from seawards has led the Finns to conclude thatone of the Russian ships was damaged.The Finnish naval forces are thought to be concentrated to the south-west ofthe Aaland Islands in order to control the passage into the Gulf of Bothnia,which has been mined. The passage to the eastward of the Aaland Archipelagois so full of skerries as to be unnavigable to all except local coastal craft.Following the blockade declaration, Russian minelayers are said to be laying-mines in the waters west of the Aaland Islands. It is also reported fromHelsinki that four Russian submarines have been sighted north of the Islands,past the mines recently laid.Provided the Finnish Navy is not driven off by Russian heavy ships, it shouldbe able to prevent Soviet light forces from raiding shipping in the Gulf ofBothnia.Situation on land and in the air.40. There has been little change in the military situation. Russian forces have advanced slowly at a number of points and have met with stubborn resistanceeverywhere. The Finnish troops have, for the most part, fallen back slowty, butin some instances have counter-attacked and recaptured ground. The maintheatre is the Karelian Isthmus. The Finnish General Staff consider operations on other fronts to be of minor importance owing to the difficulties of communica-tion and maintenance which the Russian advance must encounter. On the otherhand, a successful Russian advance across the &quot; waist line&quot; of Finland wouldhave serious results, since it would cut Finland&apos;s communications with sweden and Norway.The Finnish withdrawal to their main defensive line was more leisurely than had been anticipated by the Finnish General Staff. The Russian force on this front is the 7th Army, consisting of nine divisions. The initial thrust appearsto have been on the eastern flank, where the Russians made repeated attempts to force a crossing of the Vucksi waterway at Kiviniemi and attacked nearTaipale, on the shore of Lake Ladoga. Recently, there have been reports of fiercefighting in the centre of the Isthmus, which may indicate an attempt to pushforward west of the Vuoksi waterway.Soviet forces are now in contact with the main Finnish defences in theeastern and central parts of the Isthmus. Further west, where stronger Finnishdefences cover the Helsinki railway, they have made less progress. In no placedoes the main defensive line appear to have been breached.41. North of the Isthmus Russian forces have occupied Pitkaranta onLake - Ladoga and appear to have advanced from 30 to 40 kilometres nearStiojarvi (some 80 miles north of the Lake). Between this area and the extremenorth they have made little progress.In the extreme north, Petsamo is said to have changed hands more than once. At present it is probably occupied by the Russians, who also hold a stripof territory southwards along the Russian frontier. Soviet troops have not, how-ever, reached the Norwegian frontier, which is less than 20 kilometres fromPetsamo, and the nickel mines at Salmijarvi are still intact and in Finnish hands.42.   There has been little air activity during the past week owing to bad .weather. ... \M. Erkko, the Finnish Liaison Officer to the Swedish Defence Ministry, Crecently informed His Majesty&apos;s Air Attache at Stockholm that no italian aircraft, other than twenty-five fighters ordered before the war, are being delivered in Finland.  Of those fighters, two have reached Sweden and six are still detained   /in Germany.   With the exception of the Gladiators to be sent from this country  f!and a dozen fighters and a dozen bombers which Sweden proposes to send, nopromises of aircraft from any other country have been made.[20485]c
