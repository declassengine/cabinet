COPY NO,C RET.MO) 15.iso C . 0-. S . C 40) 190 .) WAR CABINET.POSSIBLE CAPTURE OF THE NORTHERN SWEDISH OREFIELDS BY GERMAN PARACHUTE TROOPS.&quot;Repprt by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.At their meeting on the 8th January   the Y/ar cabinet invited us to consider the possibility of the Germansattempting to seize the mines in Northern Sweden and/orthe port of Lulea by parachute troops.2. In paragraph 33 of our report on the military implications of a policy aimed at stopping the export ofSiWedish iron ore to Germany (W.P.   (39) 179), we stated:-&quot;The Germans might possibly attempt to seize Lulea orother points by parachute troops in conjunctionwith air landing battalions at Boden aerodrome,Such an operation would probably be undertaken inconjunction with air action or sabotage to delaycur advance from Narvik,      The Germans would, however,need aerodromes in Southern Sweden from which to despatch their air transports;      and they could notcommence the operation until at least 14 days after their first landing in Southern Sweden.    This would-deny them the opportunities of surprise,,    Swedishopposition should largelt mitigate the chances ofthis venture succeeding.    On the other hand, Swedishforces might not be suitably prepared, and it isdesirable that our advanced force-3 should i each theLulea area at the earliest possible date to secure      jthe aerodrome and -^ther key points. &quot;5. We have re-examined this question in the light of therecent secret reports in which it is alleged that the Germans&quot;&apos;- Ihave a considerable number of parachute troops standing by.These reports, however, throw no new light ..n the problem,We,  therefore,  adhere to our views as expressed above, butwe would take this opportunity of qualifying the statement that &quot;they could not commence the operation unoil at least14 days after their first landing in Southern Sweden&quot;,This statement ,$n reconsideration seems to us somewhattoo categorical-        Jt would have been better expressed ifwe had said &quot;it seems unlikely that they could    ommenceoperation until at least some days after the!:;- first landing in Southern Sweden, &quot;X   W.M.(40) 6th Conclusions, Minute 8,TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to    o    . -   &quot;ensure the secrecy of this document.

4. The distance from Northern Germany to Boden, the anlyaerodrome near the Northern ore fields, is 800 miles.,German aircraft have not the endurance to carry out both the outward and return journeys without refuelling.      TheGermans might decide to sacrifice a number of aircraft in anattempt to establish, and subsequently to maintain, a small force, but we consider that the chances cf this operationbeing carried out successfully in winter conditions, andin the face of Swedish opposition, are so slight as tobe negligible.       \(Signed) DUDLEY POUNDR.E.
