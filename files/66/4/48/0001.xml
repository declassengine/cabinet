(39) 1*1-8)and the recommendations for our long-term policy contained therein, and to submit their recommendations to the War Cabinet&quot;.2. In accordance with the above conclusion we examined the recommendations contained in the Report by the Chiefsof Staff (Paper No.W.P.(39) 148, paras. 23-25) at our meeting on the 3rd January, 1940.General Policy.3. Before dealing with the recommendations themselves,we desire to offer some general observations.      TheChiefs of Staff visualize that we may have to operateconsiderable forces- in the Near and Middle East to protectour vital interests and to support our Allies.      They donot recommend the dispatch of forces to this area atpresent.    Their proposal is only to proceed at once withall the administrative preparations necessary for theoperation of additional land and air forces in this theatre, in order that these forces may be able to functionwith the least possible delay should the strategical situation demand their despatch.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.

This policy seems to us a wise and prudent one, and it hasour fullest support.    Broadly speaking the conception is tohe administratively prepared to operate a force amountingto some 12 divisions and 39 squadrons of aircraft in theMiddle and Near East (excluding the squadrons allotted forthe defence of India and for co-operation with the Navy).Relative Priority of JdiddjLe ^awt - requirements,4o As the Chiefs of Staff indicate in their Report, any decisions to despatch additional forces to the Middle Eastwill have to be taken in the light of the strategical situation as it develops,.    We agree with them that in assessing therelative priority of the claims of the Middle East theatre?the security of the Western Front and of Singapore must atall times be assured.    It should be noted that the australian and New Zealand Divisions are being sent to Palestine and egypt merely as a convenience for training purposes.Implications of^ Policy vecomrnended.5. We were informed that the additional forces for whichpreparations are proposed are, generally speaking, includedin existing expansion programmes.    The expenditure involvedin the Chiefs of Staffs&apos; recommendations will therefore be incurred mainly in producing the administrative structurerequired for their operation.    Broadly speaking, thiscomprises such matters as the construction of storage accomodation, the improvement of docks and transportationappliances and the accumulation of reserves of supplies andexpendable stores.    For the air forces the provision of landing grounds and some extension of repair facilities willbe required.   Expenditure on the various items of the programmewrmld of c .-urse be referred to the Treasury in the ordinary way.lS;vel i-pnent of Supply Cap.aci.ty_East .qf the i\iedit mediterranean.5, X&apos;l the stntegicol position in the Mediterraneanseriously deteriorated, we might be compelled to send outlilic -\o.d-7. -Li -nrvl  forces envisaged in the   Chiefs of staff report at very short notice,    and to maintain then as far

as possible from sources east of the Mediterranean.    With this contingency in view, we consider it important that every form ofsupply capacity which already exists cast of the Mediterranean shouldhe exploited to the full;  and that steps should he taken to developfurther capacity in this area,  at least for the less complicatednatures of equipment.    The principle, in fact, would he to provide,for the maintenance of our strategical reserve of force in theMiddle East,  a corresponding strategical reserve of supply capacity in the same area and thus reduce their dependence on the line ofcommunication from Home which might he interrupted.    We realise that the advantages gained by this policy may result in payingslightly more for certain items of supply, but the extra expenditure involved may well prove a cheap insurance premium, more particularlyshould it result in some economy of-shipping, the vital importanceof which is stressed by the Chiefs of Staff in paragraph 21 oftheir Report.Recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff in detail.7. We turn now to the detailed consideration of the recommenda-tions of the Chiefs of Staff, which arc summarised in paragraphs23, 2h and 25 of their Report,Land Forces.8. &quot;(i) The development of base organisation inEgypt and Palestine and the gradualaccumulation of Material reserves for a force of 9 divisions (including thepresent garrison) should be put in   hand at once&quot;.We concuy.    The scale of reserves and of those for otherforces mentioned below,  is dealt with in paragraph 22c9. &quot;(ii) Reserves should be accumulated in India for 3divisions and mobile troops for employment inI I Iraq and Iran.    Basga^should be developed as aIf base port for a force of this size&quot;&apos;1.One of these three divisions would be that referred to inparagraph 10 below.    The other two would probably be British ors Note. The question of building up industrial capacity in Palestinehas already been before the War Cabinet, vide W.M.(39) 53rdConclusions, Minute 3(C) and 66th Conclusions, Minute 10.

Dominion.    The .cost of all the reserves, which would consist mainly of food, ammunition, clothing and transport, would fall upon theUnited Kingdom,10.        &quot;(iii) One division should &quot;bo concentrated early in Indiaand earmarked for the defence of the Anglo-Iranian oilfields.&quot;We arc informed that the Government of India has already offered to provide this division, which would he mainly composed ofIndian personnel.    We recommend that this offer should be accepted and the division prepared for service overseas without delay.      Itis understood that the offer is conditional on the full cost falling on the British Exchequer,  and the War Cabinet will no doubt wish tohave the advice of the Secretary of State for India on this aspect of the question,11. &quot;(iv) An African division should be formed in Kenya fromunits already there combined with one,  and laterwith a second, brigade of the R.W.A.F.F. fromWest Africa.&quot;Agreement has been reached between the Colonial Office andthe War Office on all the arrangements required to implement thisproposal, but no final decision has yet been taken by the WarOffice on the matter.&quot;12. In this connection the War Cabinet will recall an offer byGeneral Smuts to despatch a brigade from the Union of South africa to Kenya, which was considered by them at their meeting on the 18thDecember, 1939.      ^ov political reasons it was decided to inform general Smuts that it was not considered necessary for the JUnion tomove land forces to Kenya in the near future, but that the despatchof air forces would .be welcomed.    General Smuts was also told thatthe formation of an African division from the forces of the East and west African Colonies was under active consideration.13. It was felt by some of the Committee that it would be unfortunate if no use were made of these colonial forces, which arcof great potential value for operations anywhere in tropicalconditions.s W.M.(39) 118th-Conclusions, Minute 8.-2i-

14.        &quot;(v) ah additional battalion of. the Sudan-Defence Force should be raised,,&quot;!e concur^15. &quot;(vi)    Until the strategic situation as betweenthe West and the Middle East becomesclearer, we do not recommend the con-centration in the Middle East ofadditionalformations other than the above ^ and.those which have already been ordered there,viz.    the 1st Australian and   New ZealandDivisions and the 1st Cavalry Division.&quot;We have already expressed our general agreementwith this recommendation in paragraph 4 above.      Itshould be noted that, with the full concurrence of theFrench, the 7 infantry battalions due for withdrawal from Palestine on replacement by the 1st Cavalry Divisionhave been retained there pending further discussion withthe French on the details of the military policy of theAllies in the Near East.Air Forces.16. &quot;(i)    The institution of such measures as can betaken to improve the mobility of our existing squadrons in the Middle East.to enable them to operate from Turkeyor Greece, and also to handle such limitedair reinforcements as we might conceivably be forced to find, possibly as early as the spring of 1940.&quot;We concur.17.        &quot;](ii)    The &quot;gradual increase of our air forces inthe Middle East and India and thecorresponding base organisation up to thefollowing totals:-/ i. e*  those referred to in paras.  10, 11 and 14 above/

(a) Mediterranean and Middle East areayexcluding Egyptian and Iraq airforces).Bomber squadrons (heavy).., 4Bomber squadrons (medium)  . . 8Fighter squadrons ....... 3... .10Army co-operation squadrons. 5(b) India.Bomber squadrons (heavy)   ..... 2Bomber squadrons (medium)  ... 4Fighter squadrons ,. ........ 4Army co-operation squadrons. 4(The provision of fighter squadrons isthe most important requirement for India).&quot;We concur.The additions to the present air forces in theMiddle East which are involved in this recommendationare covered by the approved programme of the AirMinistry.     Additional squadrons would only &quot;be despatchedas and when they became available, and in accordance withthe requirements of the strategical situation.18.       In emergency, it would be possible to fly back the more modern types of bombers for operations in western Europe.19.       &quot;(iii) The provision as soon as resources will permit of shore base, storage anddepot facilities for the following:-Xa) to co-operate with the^Navy in theMediterranean or Red Sea^&quot;&quot;&quot;g&quot;.rV F/B.T. squadrons ... 3g.R. landplane squadrons. 4T.B./g.R.  squadrons  ..... 1(b) the Fleet Air Arm complement of2 aircraft carriers, amounting toa total of 6 squadrons with thenecessary reserves.&quot;This provision is for the contingency of war with/    Italy.      As regards (a) we recommend that the essentialaerodromes and minimum base facilities on a temporaryscale only should be authorized.20.       The necessity for the shore bases referred to in (b)

above is being further considered by the Chief of naval staff and Chief of the Air Staff.     V/e recommend, therefore,that a decision on this item should be deferred.21.       &quot;(iv) An administrative examination should beundertaken and planning should be begun to meet the above requirements and, inaddition, the necessary provision of basefacilities for a reinforcing group of 12heavy bomber squadrons from the United Kingdom.Authority should be afforded for the immediateinception of such measures as can be undertaken without reducing our resources in the West.&quot;We concurc22.        &quot;(v)    Measures which would be required to maintainthe Red Sea route should be more thoroughlyexamined by the Commanders-in-Chief, and thepossibility of obtaining the co-operation ofSouth African air forces should be explored.&quot;This matter is under examination by the Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East,     We have already referredto the proposed despatch of South African air forces to kenya in paragraph 12 above,All Services.23.       &quot;(i)    90 days&apos; war reserves should be authorised forall additional forces which may be added tothe strength of the Middle East garrisons.&quot;V/e concur.90 days&apos; reserves have already been approved forthe forces now in the Middle East,     The process ofbuilding up the reserves for the additional forces will inevitably be a slow one, and we recommend that a startshould be made at once.24.       &quot;(ii) The overland routes to Egypt should be developed as alternative routes for maintenance.&quot;The routes in question are:-(a) Bagdad-Haifa; and(b) Mombasa-Kliartov.r;. -Cairo .So far as the Bagdad-Haifa Road is concerned, weconcur.     In point of fact it has already been completedas an all weather road except for the section insideIraq.

jSp.       The Hombasa-Khartoum-Cairo route is only suitablefor a small force,  say a Brigade Group.     We do notconsider that any c^nsideriab-le -QxpejndLture^-siwild be incurred inits development&apos;.26. &quot;(iii)    The Turks should be induced to develop their air facilities and communications in Thrace and Western Anatolia, and ifnecessary technical advice and assistance should be afforded.&quot;We concur.Authority has already been given for our ServiceAttnrahes in Ankara to begin secret conversations withthe Turkish General Staff,.Conclusions.27. We recommend ;(i) that the V7ar Cabinet should approve thewhole of the recommendations of the Chiefsof Staff contained in paragraphs 23, 24 and 25of their Report on Military Policy in the middle east (V/.P.(39) 148) subject to the followingqualifications s -(a) A final decision on the desirabilityof forming an African division in kenya has yet to be taken by the WarOffice-.    It was felt by some of theCommittee that it would be unfortunate if the potentially valuable servicesof these colonial forces were not used..(Paras.  11-13).(b) No decision on the provision of shore-base,storage and depot facilities for the fleet air Arm complement of 2 aircraft carrierscan be taken pending further considerationby the Chief of Naval Staff and Chief of theAir Staff.    (Para. 19).(c) No considerable ea^^iditure should be incurred on the development of the overland route from Mombasa, through Khartoum, to Egypt.(Para. 25).

(ii) that the principle should he approved that theforces in the Middle East and in India should as far as possible draw their supplies from east of the Mediterranean.      To this end theMinistry of Supply should investigate thematter and prepare as early as possible such schemes for developing industrial capacity inthis area as can be brought to fruition withina reasonable time and with due regard to finance,,    The Ministry of Shipping should be consulted on the Transportation aspect of themaintenance problem^        (Par-aso 6 and 7).(iii) that the Ministries concerned should be instructedto proceed immediately with detailed planning and preparations on the basis of (i) and (ii)above.(Signed)    Cn15. 1. 40.hmond Terraces S.W. 1,,13th January9 1940.
