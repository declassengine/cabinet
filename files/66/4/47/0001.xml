NAVAL SITUATION.Home Waters.1. A force of heavy ships has been operating to cover the NorthernPatrol and the convoys to and from Norway.ELM. Submarine Trident is returning from a patrol off Murmansk, where she has been observing shipping activity.H.M. Submarine Seahorse is more than forty-eight hours overdue at herbase from patrol in the North Sea, and a search along the route of her intendedreturn passage is being carried out by aircraft, so far without success.2. During daylight on Tuesday, the 9th January, enemy aircraft attackedisolated ships, not in convoy, off the East Coast with bombs and machine guns.Three small British ships were sunk and two Danish steamers were badly damaged.One ship was attacked in a similar manner on Wednesday, the 10th January.Our own aircraft failed to intercept any of the raiders owing to poor visibility.Details of the ships attacked are given in Appendix 3.3. Three enemy destroyers were sighted by our aircraft reconnaissancepatrol off the Jutland coast on the morning of the 11th January. Four bombs were dropped without result. There was also considerable enemy air activitythat morning off the East Coast and, up to the time of going to press, elevenreports have been received of attacks on surface vessels and four reports of mine-laying by parachute.   Full details will appear in next week&apos;s Resume.4. On the 5th January S.S. Rothesay Castle (7,000 tons), homeward boundfrom America to the Clyde, ran ashore on the north-west point of Islay in thickweather, and has become a total loss. On the same day the armed merchant cruiser Laurentic (16,724 tons) went aground on the south-west shore of Islay.She was refloated on the following morning and proceeded to Belfast. Herdouble bottoms have been damaged, and number two hold has been flooded.H.M. Trawler Kingston Cornelian was lost with all hands following acollision with the French ship Chella at 11 p.m. on the 5th January in theStraits of Gibraltar.   One officer and sixteen men lost their lives.5. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Canton (15,800 tons), returning from northern Patrol to the Clyde, reported at midnight on the 10th January thatshe had grounded but refloated, and that the fore-peak and numbers one, two andthree holds were flooded. At 6-44 a.m. on the 11th she reported that she wasten miles north of Flannan Island, 45 miles west of the Butt of Lewis, steeringstern first, course south-west, at four knots. Destroyer and aircraft escort havebeen provided.S.S. Blairmore was in collision with the Armed Yacht Princess in the bristol channel at 2 - 30 p.m. on the 10th January.  The Princess sank without loss of life.Foreign Waters.6. The first New Zealand and Australian troop convoy has sailed. The NewZealand contingent, in five British and one Polish ships, left Wellington on the6th January and joined up with the Australian contingent of five ships outsideSydney Harbour on the 10th January. A powerful escort of British and dominion warships will accompany them.7. His Majesty&apos;s Ships Galatea and Antenor, with medical personnel and stores, have sailed for Turkish waters to render assistance to those affected by therecent earthquake8. The French Auxiliary Patrol vessel Bar sac went ashore near Vigo on the6th January.   Twenty-one of the crew are missing. .9. Additional information of interest concerning the battle off the RiverPlate has been received from the Rear-Admiral, South American Division, andfrom the Naval Attache at Buenos Atres, and has been inserted in a separateappendix at the end of this Resume.
Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. 463 ships have been convoyed during the week : 374 British, 29 allied and 60 neutral, of which one British ship, S.S. Duribar Castle, was sunk by a mine on leaving the Thames Estuary. The forces employed on escort dutyconsisted of 1 battleship, 3 cruisers, 4 armed merchant cruisers, 39 British and4 French destroyers, 17 escort vessels and 3 submarines.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. There has been a marked reduction in torpedo attacks on merchant ships by U-boats during recent weeks. This may be accounted for by a changein policy on the part of the enemy, who appears to be employing mines, manyof which have no doubt been laid by U-boats, in preference to torpedoing merchant ships.Only four attacks on possible U-boats have been carried out during theweek, one of which, by H.M.S. Vesper, 45 miles W.S.W. of Land&apos;s End, may have caused damage to the U-boat, which was seen to break surface and sink sternfirst.  No survivors or signs of wreckage were, however, observed.German Attacks on Seaborne Trade.12. Discounting the report from S.S. Kiruna referred to in Appendix 2,no British or Allied merchant ships have been attacked by U-boats. SevenBritish ships were mined and six of them were sunk; one small Dutch ship was mined and sunk.Three British ships were sunk after having been bombed and machine-gunnedby enemy aircraft.  The total tonnage lost during the week amounts to 30,804 tons. *S.S. Dunbar Castle, which was sunk by a mine in the Thames Estuary ontihe 9th January, was led into a dangerous area by the commodore of the convoy,whose pilot endeavoured to follow the instructions received by wireless from aforeign station.   This was contrary to the instructions issued by the Admiralty.A Norwegian ship, name and tonnage unknown, was sunk by a mine ortorpedo 45 miles east of Wick on the 9th January. This ship has not been included in Appendix 2.German Minelaying.13.. Reports were received of a U-boat sighted in the Bristol Channel onthe night of the 4th and the morning of the 5th January. It may have been layingmines.   Fast surface vessels were again reported in the Would, off Cromer, at p.m. on the 4th&quot; January, in the Thames Estuary and off the mouth of the&apos;Humber on the night of the 5th January, and again off the Humber on the night,of the 7th.The port of Dundee was closed for 49 hours as a result of the mining ofS.S. City of Marseilleson the 6th January.Enemy aircraft were reported in the entrances to the Humber, Tyne andHarwich after dark on the 9th January, and were seen dropping parachute mines in the Thames Estuary and off Cromer between 10-45 a.m. and 2-30 p.m. on the11th January. All the above reports indicate that a considerable number of enemy mines have been laid during the week on the East and South-East Coasts.British Mine Sweeping.14. Fog continued to interfere with mine-sweeping during the past week.Nevertheless, seventeen more mines were swept up in the Tyne area.Trials were carried out by the &quot;mine-bumper&quot; H.M.S. Borde, and on thefirst day she exploded a magnetic mine about 140 feet ahead of her. The onlydamage she sustained was one or two broken instruments and smashed crockery.On the 9th January H.M.S. Borde exploded four mines laid in a line 030o fromthe North Goodwin Lightship. The fourth explosion appears to have damagedher, and she is now in dock for examination and for fitting out with proper living accommodation.[20616]
A Wellington bomber fitted with an electro-magnetic coil and a dynamo,flying 40 feet above the water, successfully exploded one German magnetic minelying in 10 fathoms off the Tongue Light Ship in the Thames Estuary, and moreaircraft are now being equipped in the same manner.15. The standard L.L. sweep, in which the cable floats and does not have tobe supported by baulks of timber, &amp;c, should be ready in about a fortnights time.There is reason to hope, in view of the fact that our other experimental work has proved successful, that the L.L. sweep will also explode German magnetic mines;it has the great advantage or covering a much larger area and not being damagedwhen the mine explodes.British Minelaying.16. Up to and including the 31st December, 1939, the following numbersof mines were laid : The large number of mines laid in September, and the comparatively largenumber in October, is due to the laying of the Dover Barrage and other defensiveminefields for which plans and material had been prepared in peace. the november figures represent the reaction after this initial activity, but the upwardtendency in December reflects the formulation and implementing of a policybased on --(a) the accumulation and interpretation of enemy intelligence;(b) the freedom of movement of our own forces; and(c) the protection and control of allied and neutral shipping.Mines have recently been laid inside, the declared German minefield, in thepassage through which U-boats have been reported to pass.British Contraband Control.17. During the week ending the 6th January 6,264 tons of cargo Avereseized in prize. The main items are 1,135 tons of ore and metals, 2,400 tonsof petroleum and allied products and 1,488 tons of food-stuffs and beverages.On the 9th January there were 48 neutral ships in the three contraband control bases in the United Kingdom of which 24 had been there for five days or less.This total included 22 Dutch, 10 Norwegian, 6 Swedish, 5 Belgian, 2 Danishand 2 Panamanian. In addition there were one Italian and one United Statesship that had been detained for over five days.During the week ending the 6th January, the Contraband Control committee considered the cargoes of 105 ships, all of which had arrived since the30th December and, in addition, 36 outstanding cargoes from the previous week.In 84 cases the entire cargoes were released. 43 cases were dealt with underthe advanced copy of the manifest system and 31 of these ships were released by the Committee.German Merchant Shipping.18. Sixteen out of nineteen German merchant ships in the Dutch East Indieshave had vital parts removed by the authorities to prevent them sailing untilsettlement of their financial commitments has been made. The same fate hasbefallen two ships at Curacao, and the Windlmk (16,662 tons) has again beenforbidden to leave Santos owing to her refusal to unload a cargo embarked at port Elizabeth by an English firm before the outbreak of war.Four ships at Bilbao are preparing to sail, and the Bahia (4,117 tons), leftBrazil on the 5th January.   The Frankenwald (5,062 tons), which sailed fromSeptemberOctober ...NovemberDecember5,1193,9961,3681,911Total ...12,394
Narvik on the 29th December, ran ashore near Bergen and sank, and theTreue/ifels (8,457 tons) went aground off Halland. Vaero, and had to send toGermany for help.19. It is believed that the Lahneck (1,663 tons) has arrived at a Germanport and that the tanker Nordmeer (5,671 tons) has reached Vigo under theNorwegian^flag,: while the Lessee (2,624 tons) is reported to have Soviet emblemson. her fore-deck. The Pauline Friederich (4.645 tons), at Boston, has beenattached for arrears of payment. The Bahia Blanca (8,558 tons), which leftRio de Janeiro on the 6th December, reported late on the 9th that she had been damaged by ice and was sinking in the Denmark Strait.The Sao Paulo (4,977 tons) has sailed from Cabedello, Brazil. It is reported from Rio de Janeiro that the German Embassy has ordered and paid for oil fuelto be supplied within two days to the Windhuk, the BaMtonga, and the Dresden,which are at Santos. Brazil; and to the Konigsberg at Para. The Consul Hornsailed from Aruba on the 9th January.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.20. The 4th Infantry Brigade is now in the front line of the sector allotted to the British on the Saar front.Six hundred mules from India, in charge of a party of 150 Indiandrivers, arrived in Marseilles on the 6th January. This completes the concentra-tion of the animal transport required for the B.E.F.21. Enemy activity has been limited to minor raids on French posts,desultory artillery fire and active patrolling. On one occasion, a party of Germansdressed in white clothing approached the French lines across the snow. Theirwhite clothing did not prevent them from being seen, and they were driven oft&apos;with several casualties.22. Although no major troop movements towards the Dutch frontier haverecently been reported, certain items of information regarding the situation areof interest. Units of the S.S. Regiments &quot; Deutschland &quot; and &quot; Germania,&quot;both of which took part in the Polish campaign, have been reported on theDutch frontier. Fortification work on a large scale is being carried out in theneighbourhood of Meppen and opposite the Dutch province of Limburg. road and rail construction are in progress north of Meppen. The River Haas, which runs towards the Dutch frontier and joins the River Ems at Meppen, has beencanalised. Several short strips of wide road, all leading towards the dutch frontier, are being built in the area north of Aachen. Frontier traffic control isbeing tightened up, probably in order to prevent the leakage of information regarding German troop movements.Italy.23. The exchange of military information under the Anglo-italian agreement of 1938 took place simultaneously in London and Rome on the10th January.The most noticeable improvement in the Italian Army, since the recentchanges in the higher command, is the continued training of reserve officers and in.C.Os., in addition to the two classes of conscripts with the colours.An additional sum of 1,000 million lire has been allocated to the Ministryof War for the financial year the 1st July, 1939, to the 30th June, 1940, tocover additional and unforeseen expenditure &quot;arising out of the present inter-national situation.&quot; The total expenditure of the Ministry for 1939-40 is thusexpected to be raised to nearly  50 million compared with the ordinary armybudget of about  30 million. Further sums, such as were voted in 1938-39,may also be found from the extraordinary budget. Any such addition to theordinary budget would not be revealed until some time after the close of thefinancial yrear. There is little doubt that much of this additional expenditure is required to complete the armament and equipment of the army and that somehas already been devoted to improvement of frontier defences, &quot;including those
oil the German frontier. Reports -of concentrations in north-east; Italy continueto be received; but there appears to have been no important change since theend of November. ,    &apos; -Italian East A f-rica.24. Although the bulk of the white reservists called up in Italian EastAfrica in September appear to have been discharged and only specialists, retainedunder arms, the rebels, who have been encouraged by a good harvest, have continued to give trouble since October both to the south-west of Addis Ababaand, on a larger scale, north of Lake Tana. The Goggiam appears to have beenrelatively quiet since the Italian operations there in October. Abebe Aragai,whose submission was expected in the Ancober area, was reported in november to be in hiding. The main Italian concentration against the rebels appears tobe in the Uolcait district (N.W. of Lake Tana and towards the Sudan frontier),where the rebels were reported to be premeditating concerted action this month.They are, however, short of ammunition. A minor concentration of italian troops was operating in December south of Lake Ruspoli, to the south-west ofAddis Ababa.Turkey.25. The damage reported to have been caused to the railways by theearthquake on the 27th December, 1939. appears to have been exaggerated.According to official sources the railway line running eastward from Ankarato Erzerum had been interrupted only by one broken bridge between Sivasand Cetinkaya. By the 30th December, two trains from Malatya were evacuatingcasualties from Erzincan to Adana and south coast towns. Military barrackshad generally not been affected, and the total military casualties reported were less than a hundred. Troops were immediately sent to assist in the work of relief.No details have yet been received regarding damage caused by the floodsin western Anatolia.Russia.26. There are further indications that the Red Army is drawing draftsfor the Finnish front from formations stationed all over European Russia. Itis reliably reported that the authorities decided on this procedure in order toavoid further mobilisation, as the mobilisation against Poland showed seriousshortcomings. It is of particular interest to note that men and material havebeen withdrawn from Estonia, strategically a most important zone. This suggeststhat stocks of war material in Leningrad may be running low, and that congestionon the railways is such that the transport of even small quantities of warmaterial from distant depots is not easily arranged. The Finnish war appearsto have affected the situation as far afield as the Caucasus, as transport of warmaterial to the Trans-Caucasian Military District is reported to have ceased.The arrival of the 39th Division in the Caucasian area from the Far East hasbeen confirmed and provides some evidence of the reduced tension with Japan.The division is, however, probably only a replacement for a formation movedelsewhere and not a reinforcement.Far East.27.   Reports of the fighting in South China are conflicting.The Japanese forces in the Yungyun-Yingtak area (90 and 70 milesrespectively northwards of Canton) commenced to withdraw southwards on the1st January. The Japanese state that this move was voluntary, following the defeat of a Chinese army operating in the vicinity. The Chinese, on the otherhand, claim to have forced the Japanese to withdraw and, in one region, tohave inflicted a severe defeat on them. On balance there is probably moresubstance in the Japanese statement, although there is evidence to show thatthe Chinese have severely handled some Japanese units in South China.Further west, near Nanning, the situation is obscure, but it is fairly clearthat Chinese attempts to retake the city have been given up for the present.
The Japanese have intensified their air effort to interrupt rail communica-tions between Yunnan and Indo-China. Recent press reports state that animportant railway bridge on the vulnerable Yunnanfu-Haiphong railway hasbeen badly damaged and that through traffic will not be possible for a month.28. The total Japanese casualties from the commencement of hostilities upto the 31st December, 1939, are estimated at 500.000, of which 150,000 are believed to have been killed. There is no reliable data available for calculatingChinese casualties; but, at a conservative estimate, they have probably amountedto 1,500,000, of which about 700.000 may have been killed.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.Operations against the German Fleet,29. Owing to severe weather conditions Bomber Command units have only been able to conduct reconnaissance sweeps on two days during this week. Thefirst of these was on the 5th January when a force of sixteen Wellingtonsreconnoitred a specified area in the North Sea. Nothing of importance was seen. On the second occasion, the 10th January, a force of twenty-one Blenheimswas despatched between 1015 hours and 1035 hours in two formations. The firstformation of twelve aircraft completed its task and saw nothing of importance.The remaining nine Blenheims were attacked at a position approximately,;120 miles west of Sylt by five twin-engined German fighters. In the fight,which lasted 25 minutes, one Blenheim was shot down and one was compelledto leave the formation and return to its base. One of the enemy aircraft was seen to dive into the sea and one is reported to have landed and been interned in denmark. The enemy fighters eventually broke off the combat and our formationcompleted its sweep/without further incident and without sighting any German^fr^v-dl^naval forces. &apos; i^o t*Jbh t*Anti-Minelaying Operations Patrols over enemy seaplane bases. ^a,30. Bad weather was also responsible for the cancellation or curtailment of these operations on most nights of the week. Patrols had little to report of enemy activities at Borkum, Sylt or Heligoland except on the 9th Januarywhen the third aircraft on patrol bombed a row of lights on the water, indicatingenemy aircraft movements, in the vicinity of Sylt.Reconnaissance over Germany.31. Two Whitley aircraft operating from this country made successfulnight reconnaissance and leaflet dropping flights over the Hamburg and Bremenareas on the nights of the 4th and 5th January.32. A special night reconnaissance by aircraft of Bomber Command wasalso made over the Ruhr area on the 9th-10th January to determine the extentof enemy : railway activity. All aircraft completed their tasks Avithout enemyfighter opposition and only slight AA. fire.Fighter Command..33. During the early part of the week operations of Fighter command aircraft were confined to routine patrols over certain estuaries and the fishingfleet and fighter escorts for convoys and leave boats. In addition, high altitudepatrols were initiated to intercept enemy aircraft attempting reconnaissance at high altitudes.No identified enemy aircraft were plotted by Fighter Command prior to the11th January when three plots Avere definitely established as hostile. The fightersAvhich were sent up to intercept failed to make contact, but a section of Spitfireson patrol sighted a Heinkel 111 bombing a merchant ship about 20 miles off
Cromer. All the aircraft attacked and the enemy Avas seen to he seriouslvdamaged. Two of our own aircraft were hit, one making a forced landing nearCromer with a damaged radiator.The majority of the enemy air attacks on shipping on the 9th and 11th,referred to in a subsequent paragraph, were not recorded on Fighter Commandplots owing to the enemy&apos;s low height of approach and bad visibility.Coastal Command.34. Very little incident has occurred throughout the week&apos;s operations by coastal Command. Reconnaissance aircraft sighted and reported three Germandestroyers 40 miles N.N.W. of Horn Reefs at 1120 hours on the 11th. Theaircraft attacked with the anti-submarine bombs they were carrying, but did not secure a hit.One engagement, between one of our Hudson reconnaissance aircraft and aHeinkel 111, occurred on the 10th, 167 miles east of Aberdeen. The Hudson, afterexpending its gun ammunition, attempted to destroy the enemy aircraft, whichwas flying close to the water, by bombing. Two 250-lb. bombs were dropped, butthey missed, close to the tail of the Heinkel.Operations in France.35. Activity during the period was negligible. On the 10th and 11thJanuary Blenheims from France carried out photographic reconnaissances of north-West Germany, landing in England after the completion of their tasks.36.   French air operations have been confined to three photographic missions.German Air Force Activity.Operations. \37. German aircraft showed little activity during the first part of the weekapart from daily meteorological flights. On the 9th January the German bomber force resumed its attacks on merchant shipping off our East Coast. During theday various ships were attacked off Aberdeenshire and Norfolk, details of whichhave been given in a preceding paragraph. It is estimated that twelve enemy aircraft were engaged on these attacks. On the same day a solitary german aircraft is reported to have flown across France to the west of Paris, thenceover the English Channel, Kent and Essex and eventually to have crossed Hollandto its base. On the 10th January, at least twelve enemy aircraft were operatingover the North Sea, and from wireless messages intercepted it appears that these aircraft were in touch with a Bomber Group and were reconnoitring for possibletargets.German aircraft were again active off the East Coast on the 11th January.Merchant shipping was attacked off Peterhead, Flamborough Head andCromer, and mines were dropped by parachute near the Goodwins, Harwich andCromer. One enemy aircraft, which bombed a merchant ship off Cromer, wasdriven off by a fighter patrol. Another approached a convoy, but was prevented from attacking by the escorting aircraft.Troop Transport Aircraft.38. Recent. reports indicate that, in addition to the J.U. 52 transport aircraft, the J.U. 86 is also being modified to carry ten troops fully equipped, andit is estimated that there are now probably 100 of these aircraft in the german air Force. The J.U. 86 has a maximum speed of 193 m.p.h, with a range of830 miles with a full complement of ten troops:. It is now estimated that Germans could make available for the transportationof troops and supplies a total force of aircraft as under :  X   - X X&quot;.Parachute/transport Gruppen ...      ...      ...Transport aircraft in formations and reserveAircraft absorbed from the civil aircraft fleetAircraft absorbed from the civil aircraft fleetAircraft recently modified       ...1,230280 J.U. 52720 J.U. 52   &quot;100 J.TJ. 5230 (other types)100 J.U. 86
-A ir craft Industry.39. The Germans have now taken over the Polish &quot; PZL &quot; aircraft factory at Mielec, presumably with the object of incorporating it within the german aircraft industry. It is of recent construction and, so far as is known, not seriously damaged as a result of the operations in Poland.Turkey.Purchases from France.40. Delivery of the aircraft which the Turkish Government has purchased from France is progressing satisfactorily. The order for thirty Morane fightershas been completed, and the aircraft delivered. Twenty-five out of fifty trainingaircraft have also reached Turkey. The remainder of the aircraft on order areexpected to be delivered shortly.RUSSO-FINNISH  HOSTILITIES.Situation at Sea.41. Press reports to the effect that the Koivisto batteries covering the southernflank of the Karelian Isthmus defences have frustrated landing attempts canbe taken as correct. The report that the Russian battleship Oktiabrskaya-Revolutia (October Revohttion) had been hit and damaged by Finnish batteriescan also be accepted as true, but as the batteries concerned, which are the Koivistoones, are only 10-inch, the damage is probably not great. It is thought thatthe Russian Naval Staff work is so bad that proper information about thestrength of the Finnish batteries is not available to the Baltic Fleet, althoughit is known to the Naval Commissariat.The Finnish armoured ships Vainamdinen and Ilmarinen were attacked by aircraft on, or about, Christmas Day and suffered a few casualties. FourRussian planes were brought down. These ships, which have an anti-aircraft equipment of Bofors guns and two Vickers pom-poms, are probably being usedto escort Finnish convoys between Abo and Stockholm.A press report was received on the 5th January that a Swedish steamer the Fenris-w&amp;s attacked by a Soviet submarine south of Umea and eventuallysank. The Swedish crew state that the submarine did not approach closelyenough for her nationality to be seen. The Swedish Legation in Moscow hasbeen instructed to ask the Soviet Government to make an immediate enquiry.It has been suspected for some time that a few Russian submarines havemanaged to enter the Gulf of Bothnia, but it is most unlikely that they willbe able to operate effectively much longer. Lulea, Pitea, Pietarsaari andUmea are already closed, and Oulu and Vasa are only being kept open with ice-breakers. In the Gulf of Finland navigation in Hango, Bardsund and HelsinkiChannels is restricted to high-powered ships. Viborg is closed, but Kronstadtis probably still kept open by icebreakers.Situation on Land and in the Air.42. The most important news received during the week is that of a secondFinnish victory at Suomussalmi, about the 7th January. It appears that theSoviet 44th Division was ordered to intensify its attacks in this area where theSoviet 163rd Division had been overwhelmed at the end of December. The morale of the 44th Division must have become impaired, as one infantry regiment andthe divisional artillery surrendered with their hands above their heads. Thetwo remaining infantry regiments, without artillery and practically withoutwar material, were thereupon dealt with by the Finns.Little change appears to have taken place on other sectors of the front,though severe fighting is reported to be going on round Salla, some 190 miles north-east of the head of the Gulf of Bothnia.Soviet forces in the Karelian Isthmus have made a few local attacks, butthe weather has been too bad to give them much prospect of success.   Latterly[20616] c
tlhey have contented themselves with constructing a number of wired strong points, at intervals, in the western half of their line. The only significantdevelopment has been an attempt to turn the Finnish position by moving acrossthe ice on Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland. This method of extending the front is likely to become more prominent as the frozen areas increase, andmay seriously embarrass the Finns, who have few troops to spare.A striking feature of the fighting has been the success of the Finnish anti-tank defence, despite a shortage of weapons. Various methods, such as theflinging of incendiary bombs, bundles of hand grenades and bottles of petrol atthe tanks, have been employed. A new and ingenious tank obstacle has been produced by means of pit props, coated with ice and placed on the frozen ground.These props rotate under the tracks of the tank, which can make no headway.As an example of the success of Finnish tactics, the case may be quoted of thecommander of a Soviet tank brigade who surrendered after one big attack onthe Mannerheim Line because, as he put it, he could not bear to go back knowingthat he was responsible for the awful losses his brigade had suffered. One mightadd that he probably had a shreweji idea of the type of welcome he would havereceived, had he gone back. The Finns claimed to have destroyed 310 Russiantanks even before the recent destruction of  the 44th Soviet  division atSUOMUSSALMI.The Finns have also proved themselves superior in forest fighting, where their favourite tactics are to lure the Russians into a selected clearing and thenmow them down by fire from three sides. This ruse works well as the russians have been trained to press forward through the soft spots; and, if the Finnshold the front on either side of the clearing in some strength, the Red soldiers allstream forward into the trap. As many as three companies have been destroyedat a time in one of these clearings.43.   Several Russian air raids have taken place over the principal towns off inland, but little damage appears to have been inflicted.   Russian bomber aircraft have concentrated on attacking the seaports, and an air attack on Aboi was no doubt intended to interfere with shipments from Sweden.   Finnish/ morale is re23orted to have been noticeably affected by the frequency of these-Russian air attacks,In the early days of the war the Russians appear to have tried to emulatethe German policy, which proved so successful in Poland, of destroying aero-dromes. Although 200 bomber aircraft were used for the purpose and attacksAvere carried out from heights of 500 to 3,000 feet, the results obtained were very poor.The bombing of Helsingfors by a number of formations did no militarydamage. The targets appear to have been the Shell Company&apos;s oil tanks, therailway station and the General Post Office building adjoining it. Despite lowflying, they were all missed and only houses destroyed. At Kotka, large timberyards were bombed by high explosives, which destroyed the timber but caused nofire. This was an ideal target for incendiary bombs, but they were not used.Many workmen&apos;s houses were, however, destroyed.It seems that Russian pilots have consistently lost their bearings when flying-inland and experienced considerable trouble in locating their objectives.Although navigation is difficult in this region of woods and lakes, there is little doubt that the standard of navigation of the Russian pilots has been low.About one-third of the bombs released have not exploded.The Finnish anti-aircraft defence, which has been effective, owes part of its success, no doubt, to the Swedish personnel who went to Finland shortly beforethe outbreak of war to give instruction in the operation of the Bofors 40-mm. gun.Finnish aircraft have frequently operated at night, when they have usuallybeen employed to bomb Russian troops collected round fires. The Blenheims have proved a great success, particularly against Russian fighters. On two occasionsthey have been known to return to their base, after a long-distance reconnaissance,on one engine and with their petrol and oil tanks shot through. The Finns, how-ever, possess only eighteen of these aircraft, which have been used to attack dumpsbehind the Russian lines, to bomb the railhead at Petroskoi and to drop leaflets.The Fokker DXXL with its Bristol Mercury engine, has been the most:effectiveof the Finnish fighters. The Bulldog has also been in action, but onlyten out of seventeen of them are still serviceable. -: : r-    - sci
The United States are releasing, for shipment to Finland, forty-threeBrewster fighters which had been intended for the United States Air Corps. Sixshould now be available for shipment and the remainder by the end of the month.The Finns are also awaiting the bulk of an order of 1 million rounds ofammunition for the German 20 mm. guns, which they have purchased fromGermany. Twenty guns and 100,000 rounds arrived during the first week ofDecember, and it is understood that the German Government may agree to the delivery of the balance.General.44. -The situation of the Finnish armies remains satisfactory, and theunbroken series of victories must have done much to maintain the morale of thecountry. The heavy losses suffered by the Soviet Air Force the Finns claim tohavedestroyed over 200 aircraft, against a loss of under ten of their own must also have had a heartening effect. Against this, reliable reports indicate that, at anyrate before the latest victory, the Finnish authorities were much concerned at theeffect of continuous air raids on the civil population and at the shortage ofmunitions. They appear to fear that the spring will find the Finnish forces tiredand in difficulties, unless in the meantime they receive support, both in men and munitions. On the Russian side, the behaviour of the 44th Division atSuomussalmi suggests that the morale of the troops may be near breaking point.The Soviet can, however, go on drawing fresh troops from distant provinces, wherethe news of the disasters in Finland has hardly penetrated. The Soviet armiesnorth of Lake Ladoga are said to be short of supplies, and the XVI Army in theextreme north is reported to have had its rations reduced by a third. If, therefore,the Finnish ski patrols can interrupt the Murmansk railway continuously forany considerable period, there seems to be some hope that the condition of the&apos;Soviet northern armies will become desperate, and that a disaster of undisguisable;;dimensions may occur. If this were to take place, disaffection and discontentmight force the Soviet authorities to cease hostilities.kuoioj
The Battle off the River Plate.Report from Rear-Admiral, South American Division.A signalled report has been received from Admiral Harwood, summarisinginstructive aspects of the engagement against the Admiral Graf Spee on the13th December.2. Tactically, the enemy appears to have made two serious mistakes : firstly,in closing the British Cruisers (apparently in the expectation that they wouldretire), thereby enabling the 8-inch guns of H.M.S. Exeter and the 6-inch guns of A fax and A chilles to come into action at once. Secondly, in making no attemptto press the attack home on the Exeter after she had been seriously damaged and forced to drop out of the action. This was a critical moment in the fight, andhad he done this the end of the story might have been very different.3.   The fire of the enemy&apos;s 11-inch guns at a range of 13 miles was veryaccurate; this emphasises the necessity of zigzagging (speed permitting) to throwv out the enemy&apos;s range plot.  A drastic alteration of course at the moment a salvowas fired was found to be desirable.4. During the action the enemy altered course continuously behind smokescreens generated by chemical floats. It was found that hits on the AdmiralGraf Spee were rarely observed from the control, but splashes of our 8-inch shellcould be distinguished from those of 6-inch with ease.Flank marking of H.M.S. Exeter&apos;s fall of shot was carried out m H.M.S.Aja-x. No difficulty was found in observation, but casualties and damageprevented the reports being received in the former.5. Concentration of gun fire by His Majesty&apos;s Ships Ajax and Achillesappeared to be effective, until terminated by temporary failure of wireless after50 salvos had been fired.6. Spotting by aircraft from H.M.S. Ajax was carried out from about,000 feet; some difficulty was experienced in distinguishing the fall of shotfrom H.M.S. Ajax from those of H.M.S. Achilles after concentration ceased.Owing to smoke the air obseiwer found the length of the ship the best guide injudging distances &quot;over&quot; and &quot;short.&quot; Air reports were of considerable assistance in the latter part of the action. A torpedo track, slightly moredistinct than the track left by ours, was observed. The aircraft of H.M.S.Exeter was damaged before it could be catapulted, and petrol sprayed over theship; fortunately it did not catch on fire.7. British material proved most satisfactory. Except for minor mechanicalfailures, the 8-inch guns of H.M.S. Exeter, until put out of action by enemy fire,and the 6-inch guns of the light cruisers functioned well throughout the engage-ment. The 8-inch mounting proved its worth by the fact that the only turret( in H.M.S. Exeter not put out of action fired 95 and 82 rounds per gun.No serious fires occurred in either of two 8-inch gun houses which sustaineddirect hits by 11-inch shell, and the flash tightness of both 8-inch and 6-inchmountings appears adequate. This indicates that the lessons of the battle ofJutland, when three battle cruisers were lost (and H.M.S. Lion very nearly so)&apos; owing to lack of anti-flash precautions, have been effectively applied in our post-war construction.8. The 11-inch shell fired by the enemy were of two types, some being-armour piercing, with delay action before bursting, and others burstingimmediately on hitting ships or the water. These latter showered splinters,which caused many casualties and much unexpected damage; most of the bridgepersonnel of H.M.S. Exeter were killed by splinters ricochetting under the sideof the bridge roof.
9.   The electrical equipment generally functioned satisfactorily, and 36-inchsearchlight lamps and mirrors stood shock and blast well.    Telephoning was difficult, due to the majority of the upper deck personnel suffering from deafness. tand it is recommended that in future all should be supplied with ear defenders.10. Damage control worked well in all ships, and nothing unpractisedoccurred. Previous preparations to shore up bulkheads and hatches proved ofgreat value.Smoke and the extinguishing of all lighting brought out the importance of;&apos;secondary electrical illumination.  Burst fire mains and water used on fires causedminor flooding, and damaged equipment on deck level.   Fires were assisted bypaint pots, cleaning gear and loose paper.11. The Rear-Admiral concludes his report by various recommendations, themost important of which relate to splinter protection for certain instruments andexposed personnel, and the provision of some form of smoke-producing apparatus,fitted with remote control.With regard to the personnel in action, he remarks that the men should bespread out and lie flat on deck until required.   All ratings should carry torches&apos;worn on the body, and complete protective clothing, with sea boots to prevent,injury from wreckage, should be worn by fire and repair parties.Events subsequent to the A ction.12. The events subsequent to the action, and information of interestobtained from the Officers of British Merchant ships who were prisoners on board the Admiral Graf Spee, are dealt with in a despatch received from the british naval Attache. Buenos Aires.13. On arrival in Montevideo Harbour at high speed the AdmiralGraf Spee showed little apparent damage as a result of the engagement. Closerexamination revealed that she had sustained between fifty and sixty hits, but itwas difficult to assess the damage without going on board. It could, however, beseen that the control tower had received five hits, probably seriously impairing its efficiency, and that the range-finders on the fore superstructure were probablyout of action. Tier aeroplane was wrecked, one searchlight damaged, two anti-aircraft and a 5-9-inch gun disabled. There was a large hole on the port side ofthe hull, besides several smaller ones; and it was reported that there were twoholes below the water line. It was subsequently suspected that one, if not two, ofthe 11-inch guns in her foremost turret were out of action.14. Steps wei-e immediately taken by the British Naval Intelligence officer and Naval Control Staff to ensure that Admiral Harwood should receive warningthe instant the A admiral Graf Spee showed any signs of departure. considerable assistance in these arrangements was received from certain British residents, aswell as the Uruguayan official wireless station.15. As is known, her arrival was the signal for anxious consideration ofthe questions of International Law involved, and much diplomatic activity. Onthe 16th the Uruguayan Government decided that she must leave 72 hours afterher arrival, i.e., at 8 p.m. on the 17th.16. During this period, and right up to the evening of the 16th, strenuous efforts were made in the German Ship to effect repairs, men and material fromBuenos Aires being employed for this purpose. Next morning all repairmaterials were taken ashore and it looked as if she were going to sea. late in the forenoon, however, some extra boat traffic was observed, and then the wounded were brought ashore. In the afternoon, boat-loads of men and personaleffects were seen to be transferring to the Tacoma lying a short distance acrossthe harbour. At first there was an attempt, at secrecy; but later on boats full of men were openly ferried across, and by 5 p.m. over seven hundred had beencounted leaving.17. At 6-17 p.m. the Admiral Graf Spee, wearing a large ensign at theforemast as well as at the main, left harbour, shortly afterwards followed bythe Tacoma, and steamed to a position about five miles from the entrance, where
she stopped, Tacoma anchoring a couple of miles from her.   Several boats thenleft the Admiral Graf Spee for the Tacoma, and two tugs and a lighter arrived ...from Buenos Aires.All was now set for the final act, which was made as dramatic as possible. ;Exactly as the sun set the first explosion took place, while her crew, lined upon-the deck of the Tacoma, gave the Nazi salute.   Vast crowds on the shorewatched the whole performance.18.   Immediately after the destruction of the Admiral Graf Spee, her crew &apos;embarked in the Argentine lighter and tugs, and with the permission of theUruguayan Government proceeded to Buenos Aires.Information from British Prisoners in Admiral Graf Spee.19.   On board the Admiral Graf Spee were sixty-one British prisoners from eight British Merchant Ships which she had sunk.   Amongst these were.,the Masters or Chief Officers of all these ships : those of four of them had previously been prisoners on board hei supply ship, the Altmark.  All were landed at Montevideo the day after the A admiral Graf Spee&apos;s arrival.20. During their stay on board the A admiral Graf Spee they were treatedwell. They received the same food as the Ship&apos;s Company, were allowed every opportunity for exercise on deck, and were permitted to talk with the Officersand Men. Captain Langsdorff was described as &quot; a very courteous, charminggentleman.&quot; He made a point of never sinking a passenger ship, as femalepassengers would have been an embarrassment, and prided himself on the factthat he had not been the cause of a single death as the result of any of hisvarious captures. In the opinion of the prisoners, though pro-Nazi, he was notrabidly so, and was disgusted with the rapprochement between Germany and russia. He told the British Captains that as they were going to be internedin Germany, there was no reason why he should not talk freely with them:21. It was his practice when approaching a ship to close her end on, flyinga French Ensign. When he came close to, he displayed a large notice boardsaying &quot; Do not use your wireless, or you will be fired on.&quot; The initiation andcourage of some of the Masters as well as their wireless operators under thesecircumstances is commended by the British Naval Attached In this connectionall the prisoner Captains are unanimous as to the desirability of evolving some method whereby Allied warships could indicate to Merchant Ships they are approaching that they are friendly.22. The Admiral Graf Spee was magnificently equipped for manyemergencies. A considerable number of spare hands were included in her com-complement, the crew being said to number twelve hundred. Specialist officers ofthe Mercantile Marine were borne for purposes of boarding : and she also carrieda specialist &quot; Professor,&quot; expert in codes.   This reputed to be brilliantin everything connected with the handling of intercepted messages and alwaysaccompanied the boarding parties in search of papers. He was suspected of beingthe Gestapo Agent on board.23. It had been the intention of the Admiral Graf Spee to return toGermany for Christmas, but their plans had been upset by the sinking of theRawalpindi, after which Captain Langsdorff said he was aware that our patrolshad been very much tightened up. He mentioned that his ship would not proceedto any of the North Sea Ports in Germany, but would go to some port in east prussia, where they would be more immune from air attack.24. When asked why he had proceeded to the South American Coast, he stated that he thought things would become too hot for him near the AfricanTrade routes, and that he meant to show himself off the River Plate beforedoubling back across the Atlantic to Germany. He hoped to fall in withS.S. Highland Princess, whose presence in that vicinity he inferred from informa-tion in a newspaper found in the last ship he had sunk.25. He was under the illusion that we had only one cruiser off the mouth of the River Plate, and that we convoyed a certain number of ships out with two destroyers a force with which he could easily cope.   After the action,
talking to one of the British Masters, he said that when he sighted the cruiser and then the masts of two other ships, he was convinced that thev would be thetwo escorting destroyers. He was amazed at the speed and manoeuvrability ofour cruisers, and paid high tribute to the accuracy of the British gunnery. &apos; Hewas under the firm impression during the action that the Barham was &quot;in theoffing, and also thought that we had a, submarine oil&apos; Montevideo, and on that account entered the harbour at high speed, without stopping to pick up a pilot.26. His chief concern after being worsted in the &quot;action was that one of ourcruisers should not arrive in Montevideo first, and so deprive him of the rightto enter. He considered it essential to go into harbour in order to render the shipseaworthy and to repair the ship&apos;s galley and bakery, which had been completely destroyed, together with a large quantity of provisions which would have to bereplaced.27. Discipline on board the Admiral Graf Spee was lax compared with ourstandard, though the ship was clean and well kept. Officers and men had the-same food, which was lacking in quantity and quality.Much attention was paid to physical drill, which all Officers had to undergodaily as well as the men. The younger Officers were strongly pro-Nazi. TheOfficers and crew were mainly very young and inexperienced a fact frequentlycomplained of by the Captain. Nevertheless, their morale was high; they hadbeen told the most exaggerated stories about the speed of their ship, and were under the impression that there were only three ships in the British Navy theyhad to fear, as they could either run from or outgun all the rest. In thisconnection it is of interest to note that, when the Admiral Graf Spee leftGermany, the Captain told the Ship&apos;s Company that.their role was to sinkmerchant ships and to avoid encounter with any but inferior Naval Forces. Therewere to be no &quot; Falkland Islands &quot; or &quot; Coronels &quot; for them. For this reason it was not his intention to.close large convoys, but only the smaller ones, whichwould be less heavily escorted. Whether this was intended as a simple statementof policy, or as an encouragement to anticipate a safe return from their cruiseto the Fatherland, it scarcely seems the sort of language likely to foster the morale-or appeal to the pride of the Ship&apos;s Company.28. During the action the prisoners, who were locked up below, had anopportunity of observing a between-deck action party working the other side ofa bulkhead in which were some empty screwholes. They were unanimous thatit was an extraordinary thing to see how the morale faded away in that partyas the action progressed and they realised their ship was being hit. On arrival in harbour, when the prisoners were able to mingle with the Ship&apos;s Companyagain, they considered that morale had ceased to exist. However, on the next day, when the dead were landed for burial, the appearance of a large funeralparty of many hundreds was good; and the British Naval Attache notes thatthe men who could be seen on the deck of the Admiral Graf Spee appearedcheerful and happy, that the drill of the boats&apos; crews rivalled our own, andexpresses the opinion from his observation of men at work that, had the Captaingiven orders for the ship to go to sea, he would have had little trouble, if any,with his Ship&apos;s Company.29. The prisoners who had been confined in the .4 it mark gave some interest-ing details about this ship. She is a ship of some 20,000 tons, supposed to beable to carry 14,000 tons of oil, and capable of 25 knots. Her equipment is inevery respect extremely up-to-date, and she carries two large guns, concealedbehind flaps, on which Norge was written. Normally she cruised in an area tothe southward of Ascension Island, where exceptionally calm weather appearsto be usual.30. Captain Dahl, of the AItmark, a reserve officer of the old school, is astern disciplinarian, feared, respected and disliked. The crew are merchant service seamen, a discontented lot, and there was constant friction between themand the Naval Guard maintained on board her by the A admiral Graf Spee.31. The treatment of the prisoners on board the A it mark was very differentto that in the A admiral Graf Spee, being more reminiscent of slave-trading than ofthe present day. Their flats were so overcrowded that they had no room betweenmattresses which were verminous.   They could only bath on the upper deck in a
water ration of one quart of brackish water a day, which then had to be.usedfor washing clothes, and only twenty washing-bowls were provided for thecommon use of masters, officers and crews, white and lascar. There was littlesoap. Eating utensils were improvised out of old tins, and the food was insufficient and very poor in quality.The lavatories, which were open oil drums in the passages leading to theirflats, always polluted the&apos;atmosphere, and the masters were humiliated by beingmade to empty these in the presence of British and lascar crews.Exercise was very restricted and there were limitations on smoking.For political reasons the Indian prisoners received very much more lenienttreatment than the remainder.32. There are now over 300 prisoners on board the Altmark, and the captain has announced his intention of blowing his ship up with all the prisonerson board, rather than surrender her should he be attacked.
