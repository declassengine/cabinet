DECEMBER 1959.Appreciation &quot;by the Chiefs of Staff ComtnitteeaAt the request of the War Cabinet* we have reviewed the Sino-Japanese military situation at the present time.77e. submit our views in the following paragraphs.2. Japan is engaged in the present war primarily for economic reasons.      She wants to control the raw materials of North China and the China market and, as a corollary,to dominate China1s internal and foreign policy.    At thesame time her occupation of Inner Mongolia does serve as some check upon Soviet aggression against Manchuria.Japanese Situation.3. The Japanese forces have overrun about a quarterof China and control all the major ports.      Japaneseauthority in China is, however, limited to certain maincentres and to lines of communication, and Chineseguerrilla forces continue to take considerable toll of japanese garrison posts.    (See attached map).4. Recent operations in the Nanndng area of South Chinahave cut road communications with French Indo-China, andso closed one of the few remaining avenues by which China* W.M.(39) 96th Conclusions, Minute 8.
is a&quot;ble to import arms.      There is no reason to suppose that it is beyond the capacity of the Japanese Army and/or air Force to cut the Haiphong-Yunnan railway.     A- further advance by the Army to cut the Burma-Yunnan road would bea long and difficult operation, but large sections of the route are now within range of Japanese aircraft based onNanning.5. The Japanese army is heavily committed in China,where 30 out of a total of 48 divisions are engaged.      Ofthe balance,, 14 divisions and. most of the best equipmentare retained in Manchuria, Korea and Inner Mongolia as a safe guard against Russian forces in the Far East.In addition there are some 150,000 trainedreservists in Japan and Korea5  some of whom are probablybeing formed into new divisions.      It is estimated thatJax^an could liberate 14 of the 30 divisions now engaged inChina for operations elsewhere,  if she decided to curtailher offorts to retaining control of essential lines  ofcommunication and certain areas of ^arjor importance.6* Out of a total of 2100 first-line aircraft, Japan hasabout 1000 aircraft of all types disposed in China and.Formosa.     Both naval and army air services, have gained inefficiency as a result of the war and now play an important part in the present strategy of attacking towns and.cominunications in the attempt to break Chinese morale.Owing to the small opposition which the Chinese can offerJapan could at any time free a large part of the air forcesshe is at present employing in China for operationselsewhere.
79 In contrast to the Army, the Japanese ITayy is not,and never has &quot;been, deeply committed by the war.      In Tact,ohe 1st and 2nd, or main, Japanese fleets have not &quot;been engaged at all;    and only one or two out of six aircraft carriers and three or four out of seven seaplane carriersare employed in China,,      The Japanese 3rd Fleet is basedon the Yangtze and the 4-th and 5th Fleets, which have been recently constituted, are operating in the Gulf of Pakhoiand off the China coast between Canton and Swatowrespectively^There is little doubt, however,  that the war hasimposed a strain on Japanese shipping and it isestimated that about l - million tons, out of a totalcarrying capacity of some 4 millions, are being used for maintaining the Japanese forces in China.      This hasnecessarily restricted Japan&apos;s capacity for overseas trade-.8* Equally severe has been the strain on Japan&apos;industrial and financial economy.     Reliable estimatesindicate that the output of war material in Japan has now reached the maximum possible under the limitations of theavailable supply of skilled labour and the means to pay for greater supplies of imported raw materials,,     Meanwhilelittle, if any,  economic return is being obtained, from the territories overrun - even Manchuria is still absorbinglarge sums for capital investment - and Japan is living on her capital and drawing on her gold reserves to an increasing extent.     Despite these difficulties, we   are advised thatthe economic and financial strain is not so great that Itmust necessarily^ interfere with Japan&apos;s prosecution of the campaign for the next two or three years, and the war inEurope may give a welcome, if moderate, fillip to japan&apos;s
foreign trade.     In general, the lack of any   prospectof economic gain in the near future is, undoubtedly, a major factor influencing Japanese statesmen to work for anearly conclusion of the Sino-Japanese war.9* The fact that hostilities have been in progress for two and a half years is a sufficient indication of thefailure of Japan&apos;s original plan which envisaged a shortcampaign, and the people no longer regard the war with-enthusiasm.     The recent success at Manning, however, hasproTaably served a useful propaganda purpose in Japan andshould help the Japanese Army, temporarily at least, to regain the prestige lost as a result of its reverses atNomonhan against the Russians and, more recently, atChangsha against the Chinese.&apos;Chinese Situation.10*       fhe number of men (about two millions) &quot;under arms in China is no indication of her eventual chances ofsuccess, which depend on the maintenance of morale and the availability of military equipment.11.       Up  &quot;to. the present,Chinese morale has remainedsurprisingly good and,  from the few indications available,the effect of the recent reverse at Fanning has not yet beenpronounced.      It should be remembered, however, that Chinesemorale is sustained mainly from Chungking, the seat ofgovernment, and that morale in Chungking is, In turn,dependent to a great extent on the1 support afforded by foreign Powors, particularly the more powerful democracies^12a     The import of apms and war material into China isnow coofiacd to:-(a)    The long overland route from Soviet Russia,.Supplies by this route might cease in theevent of a Soviet-Japanese rapprochement.

The Burma-Yunnan road,  and(c) The Haiphong-Yunnan railway,Xiie present operations about Nanning are, almost certainly,,designed to hamper,  if not to close,  the import ofarmaments by the two latter routes.      China&apos;s means of importing armaments are,  therefore, severely limited;   butthere is probably sufficient war material in the countryalready to allow of the continuance of hostilities by theChinese, army on the present scale for nine months or more.Minor arsenals manufacture rifles and ammunition and, insome cases,  light machine guns;    and their output should allow purely guerrilla warfare to be maintained for an indefinite period,13.        Owing to her low standard of living and primitiveindustrial development, China is far less affected by economic considerations than Japan,      So long as the UnitedStates continues its present policy of purchasing silver,China should have no difficulty in financing her modestimports of armaments,14.        The standard of training and equipment of the ChineseArmy varies greatly.      Even in the Central Government form-ations, where the standard is highest,  there is a deficiency in artillery and tanks and a lack of leaders and trainedstaffs.      The army is in consequence incapable of staging a major offensive with any chance of success;    and guerrillaactivities, lacking extensive co-ordination and direction asthey do, will not achieve a military victory for the Chinese,however embarrassing they may be to the Japanese.      The smallChinese air force,  although improved in quality, can have only slight effect on the course of operations.      Only one aircraft factory is functioning and the Chinese are almostentirely dependent on Russian assistance, and aircraft whichthey are able tc import from the United States.

Russian influence,15. Russian influence lias an important bearing on the outcome of the present Sino-Japanese struggle.Japanese military leaders have a large measure ofcontrol over Japan&apos;s foreign policy,      Some of them would undoubtedly favour an arrangement with Russia    in orderto allow Japan to concentrate more fully on a solutionof the China affair.      They say that Japan is fightingChina with her left hand whilst having to keep herright hand free to deal with the potential menace ofRussia in the par East, a comment which is largely true;and urge that Russia,  for her part, would be free to devote her attention to the.West,  once she is relievedcf anxiety in the East,      These views have found strong support in Germany,16, An uncertain factor is Russian assistance to China.By offering   to withhold instructors and war material forthe Chinese armies Russia has a persuasive argument for use with the Japanese.      By threatening to withhold them she can bring pressure to bear on Chiang Kai-Shek to concedeher demands.      She is already trying in this way toohtain more executive power for the Chinese Communist and ex-Red Army leaders in tile conduct of Chinese affairs.The alliance between the Kuomintang and the communistelements is, in short, an uneasy one, held togetheronly by a mutual desire to resist Japanese aggression.17. Whatever the chances of a more extensiveaccommodation between Russia and Japan,  it is unlikelythat any arrangement would lead to a substantial reductionof their adjacent armies and air forces, i.e,, in manchuria and the Russian Par Eastern Provinces, owing tothe deep mutual mistrust which exists between the twocountries.

The United States.18. Japan&apos;s commercial relations with the UnitedStates are of extreme, if not vital, importance to her,in view of her dependence on the export trade to america.      On the other hand United States interestsin the Par East are not as extensive as those ofGreat Britain, nor do they form the same obstacle to Japanese expansion in China.The recent stiffening in the attitude of theUnited States over Japanese activities in China is causing some anxiety in Tokyo regarding the future,especially as the abrogation of the commercial treatyof 1911 between the two countries is due to become effective on the 26th January, 19^0.  The attitude ofAmerica will therefore have an important influence on japanese military policy - an influence that might beexpected to be decisive were it not for the hot-heads ofthe Army who may override more moderate political authority.Conclusions.19. Our conclusions regarding the presentsituation in China are as follows:-(a) Although two and a half years of hostilitieshave placed a severe strain on theeconomic and financial fabric of Japan,there is no reason to suppose that thepoint has been reached, or is likelyto be reached for some time, when she must abandon or restrict her military effort in China fro:-&apos; fear of economiccollapse0(b) On the other hand it is doubtful whethermilitary successes can contribute- muchtowards Japan&apos;s primary aim which iseconomic.      Her more cautious militaryand political leaders appreciate thefact that she is deriving little, ifany, material benefit from the occupied territories and,  for this reasonare extremely anxious to reach a successful conclusion to hostilities.

(c) Japan is at present trying to bring thewar to an end partly.by political meansthrough the establishment of puppetregimes, and partly through military measures designed to close chiang kai-shek -Shek&apos;s few remaining contacts withthe outside world.      So far her effortshave not succeeded in bringing about a collapse in Chinese morale, which depends greatly on the support afforded by the more powerful democracies and isthe most important factor in the wholeaffair.(d) The Chinese Government is hoping that Japan will exhaust herself and so be forced tocome to terms far more favourable to china than she is at present willing togrant.      Provided morale is maintained,Chinese military resistance on the present scale should be possible so long assufficient war material is available.Material already in the country should besufficient for 9 months or more.      Iforganised operations came to an end,guerrilla fighting might go on indefinitely,No outstanding Chinese military success,however,  is to be expected.(e) If Japan is prepared to expend the men and munitions, her    armies are capableeventually of over-coming almost anygeographical objective they may setthemselves in China, although the sub-jugation of the country might exhausther militarily and economically.      If,on the other hand Japan decides to limither commitments she could makeconsiderable military forces availablefor operations elsewhere and stillretain control of the chief communications and centres in China.      The main Japanesefleet still retains complete freedom ofaction, but Japanese shipping is deeply committed,(f) Any further stiffening in the Americanattitude will be an added inducement to japan to end the China incident at all costs.(g) No arrangement between Russia and japan islikely to free any substantial portionof the forces which Japan maintains in manchuria, Korea and Inner Mongolia.(Signed)    C.L.N.
