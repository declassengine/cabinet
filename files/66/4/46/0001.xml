Kj  C K E T.      it is requested that special care may be taken t(P0PY N0*_eLW P (40)16 ensure the secrecy of this document.(Also Paper No.n.O.S.(40)188)WAR CABINET.METHOD OF DESCRIBING D .YS IN PLANS and orders FOR OPERATIONS,MgiSggaSJ^L^ 11 e e,We think that the War Cabinet would wish to beinformed of a change that has been made in the system ofdescribing days in plans and orders for operations,  inorder to conform as closely as possible with the Frenchsystem and thus obviate the risk of confusion whenFranco-British forces are co-operating in the field.2. In the British fighting services the day on which an operation is to start has hitherto been referred toas &quot;Z&quot; day,  the    day before as &quot;Z - 1&quot; day and the day after as &quot;Z 4- 1&quot; day.      The French, on the other hand,refer to the day on which an operation is to start as&quot;Jl&quot;, the day before as &quot;J - 1 &quot; and the day after as&quot;J2&quot;.3. There have been occasions in the past when,through the similarity of &quot;Jl&quot; and &quot;Z * 1&quot;, Britishand French forces have started an operation on differentdays.      Such confusion might well have disastrous resultsand it has already been found necessary for the british expeditionary Force to conform to French practice.s   Abbreviation for &quot;Jour un&quot;.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.

4. The French system is both simpler and more logicalthan ours, and can easily be adapted to our use byreferring to the day on which an operation is to startas &quot;D 1&quot;  (Day one) , the next day as &quot;D 2&quot;  (Day two) andthe day before as (iD - l!i (Day minus one) .      It has there fore been agreed that this system should beadopted by the fighting services with effect from midnight 14th/15th  January, 1940, and that   itshould be used for any movement or operation which isdue to start on or after Monday, 15th January, 1940.5- Since Government Departments, other than theService Departments, which from time to time haveoccasion to co-operate with the Services in operations,and also public utility Companies such, for example,as railways, have hitherto used what may be called thezero system of de cribing days, they have been informed of the above change of system and.invited to adopt it.(Signed)    C.L.N.
