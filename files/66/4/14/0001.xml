Printed for the War Cabinet,   December 1939.SECRET.W.P.

The Swedish attitude has been firmerthan (had previously been expected, while the Norwegian attitude has been weaker,largely owing to the personalities of the respective Ministers for Foreign Affairs,M. Sandier and M. Koht. Even now that the Swedish Government has beeureconstituted without M. Sandier, the Swedish attitude is unlikely to change,since the Conservative party, who have now entered the Cabinet, are in favourof helping Finland, while M. Hansson, who remains Prime Minister, is opposedto an actual breach with the Soviet Union. The situation, therefore, may beexpected to remain as at present, with a steady stream of Swedish munitions and volunteers proceeding to Finland but without official Swedish participation in the war.2. It is of course questionable how long the Soviet Government will toleratethis situation. So long as they are confident of being able to overcome finnish resistance in a short time they may continue to ignore the Swedish intervention,as they are now doing, and they might even welcome it as providing them withan excuse for making demands upon Sweden at a later date; but if, as now seems more probable, they find their operations unexpectedly difficult, they maywell be tempted to put some of the blame on Sweden and demand her completeneutrality. The Swedish Minister in London thinks this a probable development;but he also thinks that in that case Swedish public opinion would not permit the Swedish Government to give way, so that Sweden might then find herself in a state of war with the Soviet Union.H.
3. Norway, on the other hand, does not apparently intend to give any directhelp to Finland, though the attitude of the Norwegian public opinion as a wholeseems less &quot; defeatist &quot; than that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It isreported, however, that the garrisons in the north of Norway (where there is acommon frontier with Finland) are being reinforced; and there seems no doubtthat any direct threat to Norway would be resisted. It is generally expected, bothin Norway and in Sweden, that, if and when the Soviet forces overrun Finland, theSoviet Government will then make demands involving Soviet control in some formor other of the Norwegian port of Narvik and the railway thence to the Balticrunning through the Swedish iron-ore district;, and the Finnish Governmentprofess to have evidence that that is, indeed, the Soviet intention (though it is, ofcourse, to their interest that this should be believed).4. Such a development would, of course, affect our own interests, and also those of Germany, in view of her dependence on Swedish iron ore; and for that reason it is difficult to believe that, as is sometimes asserted in both Swedish and norwegian circles, there is a Soviet-German understanding to facilitate it. Theevidence so far available, indeed, points on the contrary to the German Govern-ment having been taken by surprise by the actual Soviet attack on Finland, though they had been willing enough to see Soviet pressure on Finland in the negotiationspreceding it, which served their own purposes by frightening the ScandinavianStates; and it seems likely that, if Germany intervenes at all in this conflict, itwill be independently and with the object of safeguarding her own interestsagainst the Soviet Union, though that object may not be openly avowed. She hasnot hitherto taken any positive steps towards intervention; and she has no induce-merit to incur the risks of intervention so long as the area of the conflict is not extended beyond Finland. Her whole attitude, indeed, has been so vacillatingand her actions so inconsistent as to lend colour to the reports of a disagreement onthis question between Herr von Ribbentrop and Field-Marshal Goring, whichhave been received from various sources. For example, the German press hassupported the Soviet attitude, but the &quot; puppet Government &quot; at Terijoki has notbeen recognised; and though the German authorities at first put obstacles in theway of the transit of aeroplanes and war material to Finland from Italy, it now appears that transit is to be permitted and even that arms will be supplied secretlyfrom Germany herself.5. If. however, Sweden is involved in the conflict, either through Sovietreactions-to her unofficial intervention in- favour of- Einland-or- through- Soviet--demands on her after Finland has been conquered, Germany&apos;s interest insafeguarding her supplies of Swedish iron ore &quot;and, to a lesser degree, her interestin Sweden from the strategic point of view, will presumably compel her to take some action; and the obvious form for that action to take would be a demand that sweden should allow herself to be &quot; protected &quot; by German bases on her territory,on the model of the Soviet demands on the Baltic States and Finland. The Swedesare not likely to accept such a demand; and they might then appeal to the Alliesfor help.6. Germany has no such direct interest in Norway, though, so long as she can use the port of Narvik for the transport of some of her iron-ore supplies, sheis indirectly interested in ensuring that northern Norway does not fall under thecontrol of any other Power. In any case, however, it does not seem likely that norway would be involved in the conflict except as a consequence of Swedenbeing involved, since Narvik can only be reached through Sweden, while the otherNorwegian ports north of Narvik, which the Soviet army in Finland could reachwithout crossing Swedish territory, may have been coveted by Russia in the nineteenth century, when Murmansk was still undeveloped, but have noadvantages from the Soviet point of view as compared with that port. Moreover,the Soviet Government would scarcely be likely to commit an isolated act of aggression in a region more accessible to the British fleet than to the Soviet army.7. On the whole, then, it may be assumed that so long as the finnish resistance continues neither Sweden, Norway nor Germany will be involved inthe conflict to a greater degree than they are at present, except for the possibilityof the Soviet Government making unacceptable demands on Sweden as a resultof exasperation at Swedish unofficial help to Finland. It seems natural to suppose,however, that Germany, whose vital supplies of iron ore would be endangered
by Sweden becoming involved in war with any Power, would do all she could to dissuade the Soviet Union from forcing the issue in this way. There is,no doubt, the further possibility that she might herself put pressure upon sweden to stop this assistance to Finland; but that seems unlikely, as it must be wellknown in Germany that Swedish public opinion has been so roused as to makeit highly probable that such pressure would be resisted, with the result thatGermany might find herself involved in a war with Sweden which, howeversuccessful, would at the outset involve the stoppage of her iron-ore supplies and close Sweden as one of the channels through which Germany tries to trade withthe outer world.8. The position seems to be, therefore, that so long as the Finns holdout the situation will probably remain fundamentally as it is now. If andwhen they are conquered, further developments will depend upon whether ornot the Soviet Government make demands on Sweden and Norway. If. afterconquering Finland, they were definitely to declare that they had no furtherambitions, and to take some reassuring step such as a withdrawal of troops fromthe Swedish and Norwegian frontiers, it is probable that the Swedish and norwegian Governments would be only too glad to let matters rest there for thetime being; and the German Government, too, though they would much dislike aposition in which Germany&apos;s supplies of iron ore were under a constant threatfrom Russia, might acquiesce without taking guarantees from Sweden. On theother hand, Germany might feel it essential to intervene if the Soviet army was clearly threatening Northern Sweden even before Finland was completelyconquered. Soviet forces might push through to the Gulf of Bothnia in the northbefore they had made much progress in the south. Subject to any advice that theWar Office might give, it would seem possible for the Soviet army to develop sucha threat, though the difficulties of communication from their bases on the murmansk Railway must be very great. There is also a possibility that demandswill be made on Sweden at an even earlier date, if the Soviet Government becomeexasperated with Swedish assistance to Finland. It is not in Germany^ interests that either of these developments should take place; but if, nevertheless, suchdemands are made at any time and seriously pressed, she will almost certainlymake demands of her own with the object of securing her position and not of supporting the Soviet claims, which, for geographical reasons, can hardly fail to cover a part of Scandinavia in which she herself is vitally &quot;interested .&quot;97 &quot;The Allies will then be faced with the necessity of deciding whether, andif so how far, to assist Sweden and Norway to resist one or the other set of demands, or both. The Chiefs of Staff have already discussed some of the strategicaspects of this question in their memoranda C.O.S. (39) 7 and C.O.S. (39) 127of the 4th September and the 21st November last respectively; and althoughcircumstances have changed since those memoranda were written, and there might now be an over-riding political reason for taking action in spite of the strategicobjections raised therein, it presumably remains true that assistance to eitherSweden or Norway would create very serious problems which it is desirable toavoid if possible which provides yet another reason for doing everything possibleto maintain the Finnish resistance.
