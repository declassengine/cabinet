(39) 161.TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RELATIONS BETWEEN GERMANY AND THE U.S.S.R.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues for their information an interestingsummary of recent reports on relations between Germany and the U.S.S.R., whichhas been prepared by the S.I.S.  The general inference seems to be that -(1) The Germans have been &quot; let down &quot; by the Russians over Finland.(2) Joint Soviet-German action in the Balkans is possible, but no definiteproof of this is at present available.(3) The Germans are trying to persuade the Russians to concentrate onCentral and Near  Eastern Asia,  perhaps as  an alternative to&quot; expansion &quot; in the Balkans.(4) There is considerable dissatisfaction with Ribbentrop&apos;s deal on theGerman side, but nothing to show that any break with the U.S.S.R.is, at present, even remotely contemplated.I would ask my colleagues not to show this report to anyone else and to returnit to me when read.H.December 13. 1939.GERMANY AND THE U.S.S.R.THE following is based on various secret reports :  Finland and Scandinavia.(i) In mid-November it was learned on good authority that German influence in Moscow was being exerted against the Russians taking military measures against Finland; that, indeed, it was implicit in the German-Russian Pact thatthere should be no Russian invasion of Finland or any other Scandinavianterritory. The Germans welcomed Russian co-operation in applying pressure on the Northern Neutrals, but wanted it to stop at that.(ii) However, Hitler in October said that Finland belonged to the neutralRussian sphere of interest: the Finns must realize this : he would not raise a finger for the defence of Finnish obstinacy. He felt sure Russia had no intention of fighting Finland; but if Russia were provoked into war, thenFinland was lost.10764   [20476]
(iii) From what Hitler said on the same occasion, he appeared to regardNorway and Sweden as being more in his sphere; but there had been no fixing of spheres of influence yet with the Russians.   That might come later.(iv) Early in November the German Government notified the Finnish Govern-ment not for the first time that, despite Germany&apos;s sympathies for the Finnishpeople, Germany had no intention of becoming involved in a Russo-Finnishconflict. The German Government expressed the hope that the Finnish-Russiannegotiations would be concluded peacefully.(v) In sum, in this connexion, whether or not the Germans, as reportedin The Times of the 29th November, expressed full agreement with the Russiandemands, our information indicates that although the Germans did not intend to interfere, made that clear to the Finns, and counselled the latter not to beobstinate, the Germans, nevertheless, had counted on the Russians not goingto extremes. That had been implicit in the Moscow Pact, and the Russians,therefore, would seem to have let the Germans down.The Balkans.(vi) We have had good information pointing to the Germans having, as partof their Pact with the Russians, given the U.S.S.R. a free hand in regard toBessarabia.(vii) We have had nothing definite from our sources pointing to a widerGerman-Russian agreement affecting the Balkans, such as might involve a definition of spheres of interest. It seemed evident that by the end of Octoberthere had been no such agreement, because the advisability was then being mootedof making political concessions &quot; if necessary in the Balkans &quot; to the Russians, soas to make them more forthcoming over trade matters. Papen was strongly opposed to such concessions. A circular received from Berlin by a GermanLegation in the Balleans about mid-November referred to current German-Russiannegotiations regarding the possibility of concerted action by the U.S.S.R. in north-East Europe and by Germany in the South-East; but we are not sure howseriously that circular is to be taken. Early in November the Swiss Legation inBerlin had information pointing to the Russians having given some sort of assurance to the Germans that the Balkans would be regarded as a predominantlyGerman sphere once the Bessarabian question had been settled in favour ofRussia, but we have had no confirmation ourselves.(viii) In October, at all events, we had indications that the Russians would turn to the Balkans when they had consolidated their position in the Baltic.(ix) As regards Bessarabia, Potemkin told the Bulgarian Minister in moscow on the 20th October that he hoped the Roumanians would agree to cedethat territory to the U.S.S.R. But M. Antonov thought that the Russians would,if necessary, take Bessarabia by force, so as to crown their Baltic triumphs.(Potemkin also indicated that other Roumanian minority questions might be solved. M. Antonov foresaw the desirability of Bulgaria registering her claim tothe Dobruja, and expected that the Russians would require port facilities atVarna.)(x) We have so far no specific indication as to when the turn of Roumaniamay be coming, whether from the Russian or German side. No special Russiantroop movements have been reported of late, but, of course, there are alwaysstrong forces available in the Ukraine. There has, however, been a recent reportof Soviet air preparations in the area South of Tarnopol, which may be significantand which we are following up. (Weather conditions are certainly not favourable for land operations, but weather conditions have not proved a deterrent as regardsFinland.)&apos; (xi) It may be noted that Russian and German propagandists in the Balkans,and also in Turkey, have been taking advantage of the moves, or possible moves,of the other partner. German propagandists, for instance, have been exploitingTurkish and Roumanian fears of Russia.Central Asia.(xii) The Vblkischer Beobachter article quoted in our press on the 6th ...December reflected what we have previously reported regarding the aims of,in particular, Ribbentrop : aims envisaging, inter alia, the use of the Russians tofoment revolution in India, working through Iran and Afghanistan, and to stirup trouble in the Middle East generally.
(xiii) While there has apparently been some wishful thinking, coupled withopen propaganda, on the part of the Germans in this connexion, there have beencertain indications from the Soviet side, official and Comintern, that such plansmay develop in some way after the U.S.S.R. has got busy in South-East Europe.(The Soviet radio service has latterly been devoting attention to India.)(xiv) Nazi and Comintern propaganda has been working in double harnessin Iraq.(xv) There is information that in October the Germans pressed the russians to increase their forces in the Central Asiatic Military District, but that theRussians made excuses for not doing so at present. Up to the latter part ofNovember, there was no evidence of the Soviet Air Force in the C.A.M.D. havingbeen increased, but a reinforcement of aircraft at Batum and Baku is reported 70 at each place.General.(xvi) We have had much to point to growing dissatisfaction and disillusion-ment in Germany in naval and military circles, among diplomats, on the partof Goring and his entourage, and in the Party over the Russo-German Agree-ment. The German Ambassador in Moscow has warned Hitler of thefundamental hostility of the Soviet Government : Goring and Meissner havewarned him against being &quot;caught by Stalin.&quot; The surrender of the Baltichas caused widespread resentment, and in certain circles there is real fear of bolshevism in Germany. But, above all, the Germans have been disheartenedand angered, whilst experiencing a feeling of helplessness, by the Russianunreasonableness and hard-headedness in respect of supplies.(xvii) There is talk wishful thinking, maybe of the retreat from theBaltic being only &quot; temporary,&quot; and the Germans are constructing strong fortifi-cations in Eastern Poland.(xviii) But we have nothing yet to point to any sort of break with theRussians being in sight. Indeed&quot;, the Germans seem prepared to put up with agood deal in order to keep the Pact going and in the hope of it yielding concreteresults. Hitler in October, at a private meeting, stoutly defended Ribbentropand said, at any rate, that the friendship with Russia would last indefinitely.December 7, 1939.
