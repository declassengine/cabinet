NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.Throughout the week under review the Northern Patrol has been maintained by a strong force of cruisers and armed merchant cruisers. A force of heavy shipshas been operating to cover the patrol, the convoys to and from Bergen and thehomeward-bound convoy from Narvik.   These convoys arrived without incident.2. Strong submarine patrols have also been maintained in the approaches to the Skagerrak and Heligoland Bight, but there has been comparatively littleenemy activity either of surface ships, U-boats or aircraft, due possibly to thebright moonlight and the foggy weather in Home Waters.3. No merchant ships, allied or neutral, have been attacked by U-boats, and losses due to mines are again small.4. The second Canadian troop convoy sailed from Halifax on the23rd December with a powerful escort of British and French warships, and themilitary convoy which left India on the 10th December, with four animal transport companies, has arrived at Marseilles.Home Waters.5. Two strong composite forces have been at sea, one covering the convoysto and from Norway and the ships of the Northern Patrol, and the second covering the passage of the second Canadian troop convoy. No enemy merchant vesselshave been intercepted in Home Waters, but S.S. Glucksberg (2,680 tons), whichsailed from Cadtz on the 26th December, beached herself a few miles to thenorthward when signalled to stop by HALS. Wishart. Her crew were taken off by the Spanish ship Ciudad.de Melilla.6. On the 26th December H.M. Submarine Triumph, while on patrol250 miles east of Rosyth, struck a floating mine, which exploded and severely damaged her bows and prevented her diving. Air and destroyer escorts were sent out and she arrived at Rosyth safely on the 28tli December. There were no casualties.7. Air reconnaissance in the Heligoland Bight area was carried out onfive days of this week, details of which are given in the Air Section of this report.No sightings of enemy capital ships were reported, but attacks were made without result on two armed trawlers sighted off the Horn Reefs on the 24th December,on another two armed trawlers on the 25th December in the same area, and on a force of two destroyers and four minesweepers sighted off Borkum on the27th December, when one minesweeper was hit by a bomb. One enemy aircraft was seen over the Orkneys on the 25th December.8. On the 23rd December a British minefield was declared stretching froma position twenty-six miles north of Buchan Ness to the latitude of Harwich,at a distance of approximately fifteen miles off the coast. The purpose of theminefield is to obtain greater control over neutral vessels approaching our coast.At the moment this minefield is largely a paper one, but parts of it will shortly be laid.On the 22nd December a deep minefield was laid in the mouth of the Thames.The South Inchkeith Channel in the Firth of Forth has now a shallow mine-field across it, and in the Dover Straits a further deep minefield has been laidacross the searched channel oil&apos; Folkestone.9. Further progress in the development of sweeps to clear magnetic mine-fields has been made. This week, two more magnetic mines were exploded bysweeps, and detecting devices have enabled three mines to be countermined. Otherdevices to compete with the magnetic mine, including a special coil fitted to an aircraft, are nearing the trial stage.10. On the afternoon of the 21st December H.M. Boom Working VesselBayonet struck one of our mines when starting- to work on an obstruction offLeith.  One officer and two ratings were killed, and one rating seriously injured.11. Before daylight on the morning of the 25th December H.M.S. Derby-shire (armed merchant cruiser) was in collision with the Motor Collier Ed&amp;nwood
(1.167 tons) in the approaches to Spithead. The collier was sunk and her crewsaved;   There was no damage to the Derbyshire.12. H.M. Auxiliary Anti-Submarine Vessel Lodh Doon must now be pre-sunied to be lost with all hands. Her crew consisted of one officer and fourteenratings. She was last heard of on the morning of the 25th December when shereported sighting a floating mine off Blyth. which she was proceeding to destroy.Foreign Waters.13. Following the destruction of the Admiral Graf Spee off Montevideoon the 17th December, the forces which had been hurrying towards the Platefrom the northward carried out a sweep to locate the German tanker Altmark(20,000 tons), from which the Admiral Graf Spee had fuelled on the 7th December.The Altmark is believed to have on board about 300 prisoners, the remainder ofthe crews of the merchant vessels sunk by the Admiral Graf Spee. This sweephas now been completed without success. The French have disposed a numberof submarines and armed merchant cruisers to intercept the Altmark should shework towards the North Atlantic.   The area to be covered is a very large one.14. To obviate hurting American susceptibilities it was decided to dis-continue the watch just outside the three mile limit off the coast of Floridaon the German S:S. Arauca, which took shelter in American Waters when inter-cepted by H.M.S. Orion on the 20th December. Following the action withthe A admiral Graf Spee the American Republics have prepared a common protestat the violation of the declared area off the American Coast, inside which it is desired to prevent any action by belligerents.15. The naval prize ex-German S.S. Dusseldorf (4,930 tons) passed throughthe Panama-Canal on the 25th December, despite the protests of local Germanconsular authorities.  She has now arrived at Kingston, Jamaica.16. During the past fortnight one of H.M. Submarines has been employedon a search of isolated and uninhabited islands in the Southern Hemisphere,which might possibly be used by enemy supply ships. This work involved acruise of 3,000 miles and the chance, of an encounter with enemy forces of unknownstrength. For such services, and the above incident is not an isolated one, sub-marines with their high endurance and ability to act unsupported are particularlysuited.17. The Imperial Airways air liner, which left Sollum on the 21st Decemberon passage to Malta and was lost, had three naval officers amongst her passengers,of whom two were killed.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. Several days of thick fog in Home Waters, and in the Thames Estuaryin particular, have caused considerable delays in the despatch and passage of convoys. Two convoys, totalling 127 ships, cleared from the Downs on the27th December, leaving 85 ships still at anchor. Four minor collisions occurred in the fog-details are not yet known.19. A total of 471 vessels has been convoyed this week; of them 417 were british, 26 French and 28 neutral ships. The increase in neutral vessels acceptingconvoy is 26. Except for two ships damaged by mine in a north-bound East Coastconvoy, no ships were lost by enemy action; and both these ships reached harbourin safety.The British Forces employed on escort duty included 45 destroyers, 15 escort vessels, besides 4 cruisers, 4 armed merchant cruisers and 1 submarine for oceanescort.&apos; From the French Navy, 1 battleship, 2 cruisers, 6 large destroyers and1 submarine were on convoy duties.Anti-Submarine Operations.20. During the week under review no ships have been sunk as a result of direct U-boat action. There have been only two indications of U-Boat activityoutside the North Sea; the first was the sinking of S.S. Stanholme, mined in the bristol Channel off Barry on the 25th December, and the second was thesighting of a U-Boat 180 miles south-west of Berehaven on the 26th December.Attacks on the latter were carried out by H.M. Ships Venetia and Volunteer.[20539] b 2
T,wo other destroyers, H.M. Ships Wren and Witch, weve also ordered to humthis U-Boat, but results are not yet known. Of the eight hunts reported b\surface craft during the week, with the exception of the attack referred to above,it is considered that the targets attacked were &quot;non-submarine&quot; targets. Noattacks by aircraft have been reported.German Fleet Intelligence.21. There are indications that the pocket battleship Admiral Scheer leftGerman Waters on the 14th December for a long cruise, but there is, as yet, no positive evidence of this. The battle cruisers Gneisenau and Scharnhorst were reported to be lying off Brunsbuttel on the 18th December; they probably passed through the canal to Kiel, where they were reported on the 24th December.The cruiser Blucher was reported at Hamburg on the 18th December. Ifthis is correct, it may mean she is undergoing repairs.A photographic reconnaissance of Wilhelmshaven on the 27th December didnot show any heavy ships to be there.22. Twenty German merchant vessels were reported passing northwardthrough the Great Belt on the 24th December, and to be north of Anholt Islandon the 25th December, presumably engaged in the Narvik ore trade. There washeavy German wireless traffic on the 25th December, on the operation frequencynormally used by the German Fleet in the North Sea.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.23. This week there is again a slight reduction in casualties to Allied and neutral shipping. No ships have been lost by U-Boat attack. One small british merchant ship (2,500 tons) was sunk by mine and three larger British ships were damaged by mine. Eight neutral vessels were lost by mining (12,300 tons).In addition, a British trawler and a small Estonian coaster were lost as a resultof air attack at the end of the previous week.The hulk Pandora was also sunk by mine, while being towed into Blyth tobe broken up. This ship had served in the Navy as a submarine depot ship formany years, as H.M.S. Pandora and later H.M.S. Dolphin.The details of ships mined and the totals of losses to date are given inappendices to this report.German Mine Laying.24. The German minefield in the Tyne area continues to give trouble. Itseems certain that the mines laid there have delayed release, so that it is notpossible to guarantee that the Channel has been cleared. This has resulted inthe Tyne and the ports of Sunderland and Blyth having to be closed at various times during the week.It is probable that the loss of S.S. Stanholme, sunk oft&apos; Barry on the25th December, was due to a magnetic mine and it may have been one of a fieldin this area which had previously been declared dangerous.There is no definite evidence of fresh German minelaying this week. Tworeports of suspicious activities have been received; one by the Dutch S.S. Ingathat a German merchant vessel was apparently laying mines off Sylt on the17th December, and the other to the effect that Danish fishing smacks equipped with wireless were sighted 250 miles east of Aberdeen in close formation andnot fishing.25. German aircraft were observed to come down to about 1,000 feet offthe Humber on the 23rd December. This is the normal height for droppingparachute mines. In addition, there have been seven reports of unexplainedexplosions off the East Coast, which may be premature mine explosions.Economic Warfare.British. Contraband Control.26. During the week 6,824 tons of cargo were seized. Of this, the principalitems were 670 tons of ore and metals, 4,658 tons of petroleum products, 614 tonsof food-stuffs and 660 tons of feeding-stuffs. One small Dutch ship, the Njord(374 tons), was seized in prize.
The difficulties in connection with contraband control and Italian trading-have increased considerably. Endeavour is being made to persuade the Italiansto form a joint committee with us and so reduce the possibilities of friction.The trade agreement with Sweden has now been signed.French Contraband Control.27. It is reported that 16 ships passed into the French contraband controlbetween the 18th and 24th December, and that 40.000 tons of cargo were seizedin prize.German Contraband Control.28. Such information as is available suggests that German activities are mainly confined to small Baltic and Scandinavian ships. Since the 6th Decemberinformation has been received that eight vessels of a total tonnage of 10,344 tonshave been taken to German ports. There axe indications, too, that the combina-tion of minefields and German control to the south of Sweden and the DanishIslands has had the effect of driving Baltic trade overland.MILITARY SITUATION.British Expeditionary Force.29. Headquarters and ancillary units of the 5th Division have now arrived in France, thus completing that formation.Reports from the British sector of the Saar front state that there has been no activity apart from patrolling. The 3rd Infantry Brigade has been relieved by the 12th Infantry Brigade on this front.Western Front.30.   No&quot;major operations have taken place.On the Rhine-Moselle front several minor German attacks were launchedon French positions and successfully repulsed.On the Rhine front a tentative attempt by the garrison of a German casemateto fraternise with French troops was interrupted by French machine-gun fire.Norway.31. It has been reported that only eight battalions and four artillery groups of the Norwegian Army had been embodied on the 17th December, and that halfthis force was in the extreme north-eastern district, based on Kirkenes. this may be an underestimate, as His Majesty&apos;s Representative, Oslo, reported onthe 19th December that there were 20,000 Norwegian troops guarding the Finnishfrontier.The Balkan States and Turkey.32. A Bulgarian official statement of the 7th December stated that thenumber of troops on the Turkish frontier was being reduced.Far Bast.Military Operations.33. Japanese military operations during the past week have been confined to north-west and south-west China.In Shansi and Siuyuan, large-scale operations against Chinese guerrillashave taken place. They do not appear to have been entirely successful, as press reports state that the Japanese encountered unexpected Chinese resistance nearPactow, the western terminus of the Peking-Siuyuan Railway. ConsiderableJapanese troop movements from Manchuria to North China have also beenreported, and it is possible that the Japanese may have underestimated thestrength of the Chinese opposition likely to be met in this area.In south-west China the Japanese have continued their advance fromNanning, and now hold a line some 10 to 20 miles north-west and north of thecity. Press reports also state that Japanese troops have reached the boundary ofFrench Indo-China in two places.
. The object of these operations is, presumably, to consolidate the Japaneseposition in the &quot;occupied&quot; areas and to cut the remaining supply routes intosouth-west China.Situation at Tientsin.34. Discrimination against British civilians still continues, and cargo is usually held up for many hours unless bribes are given to the Japanese-sponsoredChinese police. The attitude of the Japanese military authorities in Tientsinhas recently been slightly more friendly, but this is probably only a temporaryimprovement due to the reduction of the British garrison.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.Operations against German Naval Forces.35. During the week under review a number of reconnaissances have takenplace with a view to locating and attacking enemy naval forces.On the 24th December seventeen Wellingtons made a reconnaissance of an area off the west coast of Denmark and sighted several patrol ships in a position40 miles north-west of Horn Reefs. The ships were steaming in pairs and, afterchallenge and counter-challenge, they opened fire on the aircraft withpom-poms. Three Wellingtons attacked, dropping eight 500-lb. bombs from aheight of 4,000 feet. Observation was rendered difficult by clouds and it is not known if any hits were made.36.   There were other bomber reconnaissances of specially selected areasmade on the 21st. 23rd and 26th December, but no enemy warships were seen.All the aircraft engaged on these reconnaissances returned safely.Other A activities.37. On the 23rd December four Whitleys from No. 4 Group carried out the dual operation of reconnaissance and the dropping of leaflets over Bremen and hamburg as well as an offensive patrol over the enemy seaplane bases at Borkum.nor deney and Sylt. There was no opposition either by enemy aircraft or by anti-aircraft fire.38. Two Blenheims were detailed on the 24th December to carry out aspecial photographic reconnaissance of Wilhelmrhaven, but cloud over the harbour made photography impossible. On the return flight the aircraft passed over Heligoland and observed no large vessels or unusual activity.This operation was repeated on the 27th December. The photographs showtwo warships cmisers or destroyers -lying at the eastern end of the HipperHaven, one destroyer and one submarine at anchor in the roads between SchilligPoint and Mellum Island and six auxiliary vessels lying off WilhelmshavenHarbour. In addition, a convoy of seven or eight merchant vessels, each of about,000 tons, was observed 30 miles east of Heligoland steering south. the photographs reveal that five of these ships were towing paravanes. One of our aircraft is missing.Fighter Command.39. Fighter aircraft made a total of eighty-four patrols during the week.These included special escorts for leave boats on the cross Channel service, andpatrols over the fishing area off the Norfolk coast.Several plots appeared on the table during the week, but only two wereidentified as enemy raids. The first of these occurred on the 22nd December, whentwo enemy aircraft were reported 40 miles north-west of St. Abbs Head soon after 1000 hours. Two sections of 602 Squadron were ordered to intercept. one section sighted the enemy about 15 miles east of May Island, and attacked them.The enemy dived into the clouds. It is possible that these aircraft were&quot; Junker 88 &quot; the latest type of German bomber as shortly afterwards aHudson encountered an aircraft of this type 120 miles east of Farne Island.   It
was noticed that three large objects were slung under the wings of the enemy aircraft, which might have been either bombs or mines.The enemy raid on the 27th December proved to be a Dornier 17. It was reported just before 1200 hours travelling north off the east coast of Norfolk.Two patrols were despatched to intercept, but they were unable to overtake it.Coastal Command.40. The usual routine anti-submarine patrols, reconnaissances, searchesand convoys were maintained, in addition to several special patrols andreconnaissances.On the 22nd December a Hudson from No. 18 Group sighted S.S. Uka, asmall Estonian vessel flying the Panamanian flag, 170 miles east of Girdleness,She was stationary, and appeared to be considerably damaged. The Hudson madecontact with S.S. Soumi, directed her to the Uka and waited while a search wasmade for survivors.41. Coastal Command aircraft had engagements with enemy. aircraft onthe 22nd and 27th December. On the 22nd a Hudson encountered the Junker 88,referred to above. 120 miles east of Farne Island. The enemy aircraft openedfire from about 400 yards, and a combat ensued, in which the Hudson managed to get two long bursts into the Junker, which broke off the fight.On the 27th December a section of No. 220 Squadron attacked twoDornier 18&apos;s 75 miles west-north-wrest of Horn Reefs. There was a sharp fightwithout decisive i*esuit.Later three Hudsons from No. 224 Squadron made several attacks on aDornier 18 which was approaching the damaged submarine Triumph in a position195 miles east of Bass Rock. A large number of rounds appeared to enter thehull of the enemy aircraft, which was last seen losing height in a slow spiral.42. Aircraft of this command also made attacks on enemy surface vessels in the North Sea.On the 25th December an aircraft of No. 220 Squadron saw two armed merchant vessels or minesweepers similar to the Beowulf Class 42 miles north-north-west of Horn Reefs. It dropped four bombs on the starboard ship,two falling within 20 yards of the port side and twro about 50 yards on thestarboard side.On the 27th December a section of the same squadron sighted two destroyers and four minesweepers 28 miles north-west of Borkum and seven patrol vesselsabout four miles south-east of this position. They bombed the patrol vessels from,000 feet. A bomb was seen to explode on the stern of one of the patrol vessels.The aircraft then returned to the destroyers and minesweepers and made oneattack. No damage was observed. Heavy A.A. fire was encountered from allsix ships. &apos;Operations in France.43. A number of patrols were despatched by the Advanced Air Striking-Force during the week. The only operation of special interest was one in whichthree Hurricanes were engaged on the 22nd December. When patrolling on our side of the line they were attacked by eight Messerschmitts 109. The fight lastedabout eight minutes. Two Hurricanes and one Messersehmitt were shot down.It is believed that a second enemy fighter was destroyed, but it was not actuallyseen to crash.44. The Royal Air Force component of the field forces also despatchedseveral patrols. A Blenheim of No. 57 Squadron carried out a photographic reconnaissance of a portion of the Siegfried Line on the 21st December, and tookphotographs. On the 22nd another aircraft of the same Squadron carried out aphotographic and visual reconnaissance of another part of the Siegfried Line,and photographs were taken from 20,000 feet. Neither aircraft encounteredenemy opposition.Operations by the French Air Force.45. Activity by the French Air Force over German territory during theweek the 20th-27th December was more extensive than at any time since thebeginning of November. The most important reconnaissance of the week was undertaken during the night of the 22nd-23rd December, when French aircraft
spenetrated German territory as far east as Munich. On this flight, and during asecond reconnaissance over the district south of Karlsruhe, propaganda leaflets were dropped. At the same time a reconnaissance was carried out over the black Forest area. Five photographic missions were executed on the22nd December, in the vicinity of Saarbrucken and north of the Ohrenthalsalient, while on the 24th December a further short reconnaissance was made overthe right bank of the Rhine north of Mulhouse.German Air Force Activity.&quot; 46. There has been little enemy operational activity during the past weekand flights over the North Sea have been below normal. There have been no enemy bombing attacks on trawlers or merchant ships since the 19th December.Reconnaissance.47. Reconnaissance flights were made on the 22nd December over theFrench-Swiss frontier west of Basle, on the 23rd December over Laon and overthe whole length of the Franco-Belgian frontier, and on the 24th December overAlsace.Enemy A aircraft Losses.48. During the week ending the 24th December, a total of thirteen enemy aircraft casualties were confirmed. The details are as follows: On the18th December it was reported and confirmed by crews of Wellington aircraft during the Heligoland-Jade Roads engagement that six Messerschmitts 109 and six Messerschmitts 110 were shot down by our bombers. Although final confirma-tion has not yet been received these twelve losses are provisionally accepted. OneMesserschmitt 109 was shot down on the 22nd December by Hurricanes inFrance.In addition, during this period, nine unconfirmed losses are reported, asfollows :  On the 18th December, off Heligoland, two Messerschmitts 109 and fourMesserschmitts 110 in addition to those mentioned above.On the 21st December a Messerschmitt 109 was believed to have been brought down by French fighters North of Vieux Brisach and a second North of Freiburg.On the 22nd December a third Messerschmitt 109 was believed to have been shot down by Hurricanes in France.Totals for the week are therefore : Messerschmitt. Confirmed. Unconfirmed. Total.109 7 (5) (12)110 6 (4) (10)Total      ...       13 (9) (22)RUSSO-FINNISH HOSTILITIES.Situation at Sea.49. The ice conditions in the Gulf of Bothnia are rapidly precluding thepossibility of Russian submarine action in this area. A Russian communiquehas been issued denying press reports regarding damage to the Soviet battleshipOktiabriaskaya Revoluiia.Situation on Land.50. Information received during the period under review shows that thesituation of the Finnish armies has improved considerably in all sectors.51. On the Karelian Isthmus a major Soviet offensive which took place between the 19th and 21st December failed to make any impression on the Finnishdefences, though it was accompanied by very heavy bombardments by artillery and aircraft. Lack of success appears to have reacted unfavourably on the morale of the Red Army; and, though the offensive has been continued, it has achievednothing.
52. On the eastern frontier Finnish troops have scored a number of successes,helped by severe weather and by increasing Soviet maintenance difficulties.In the sector immediately north of Lake Ladoga the Finnish counter-offensivewhich began in the middle of the month in the neighbourhood of Tolvajarvi hasmade considerable progress and Finnish troops are now east of Aglajarvi. this movement became a threat to the Soviet forces operating round Lieksa andLoimola and forced them to withdraw; the Finns now claim that they are operating in Soviet territory east of Lieksa.Further north the Finns claim successes round Suomussalmi and on the outskirts of Saixa. while the Soviet offensive in the Petsamo sector appears tohave come to a standstill, probably owing to the weather. Any danger that there might have been of a Soviet advance reaching the Gulf of Bothnia in the nearfuture has now receded.53. These successes have greatly improved Finnish morale, and the high command are now very confident. They find the enemy&apos;s leadership feeble,his tactics poor and wasteful, his troops inferior. They express themselves asable to hold the Karelian Isthmus against any attack the Soviet can make and consider that maintenance difficulties will prevent attacks in other sectorsdeveloping on a dangerous scale. In spite of Finnish confidence it is doubtfulwhether it would be physically possible to hold any position against the weightof artillery which the Soviet could deploy against the Karelian Isthmus position,unless the defenders possessed large quantities of artillery and aircraft to carryout counter-battery bombardments on a large scale. It is, therefore, to be hopedthat-Finnish optimism will not lead them to undertake any dangerous counter-offensives, which might well result in losses of men and material the country could ill afford. It should be remembered that the Russian soldier always gives a much better account of himself in defence than in the attack.On the Soviet side it appears that the High Command have been attempting to reverse the course of events by bringing np further reinforcements, a doubtfulremedy in a war where lack of communications and limited frontages are the decisive factors. There is. how7ever. some chance that Russian numbers maytell in the south, once the ice on Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland becomesthick enough for Soviet troops to operate across them.The latest reports suggest that there are eleven Soviet infantry divisions in the Karelian Isthmus and sixteen divisions between Lake Ladoga and theArctic Ocean. A partial evacuation of Leningrad is reported to have takenplace so as to facilitate the working of the principal base of these large forces.Air Situation,54. Numerous raids were made on Finnish towns by the Soviet Air force during the week under review, especially on the 21st December, Stalin&apos;s birthday,and on Christmas Day. Altogether. 42 civilian centres were bombed, Helsinkiand Viborg in particular. The damage done was not considerable, and civilian casualties were relatively small, although many aircraft were engaged in the attacks. As many as 30 to 40 aircraft were engaged in an attack on Viborg.The Finnish authorities have ordered all who are able to do so to leave this town.The Soviet Air Force have also bombed moving trains, railway centres and coastal batteries.   No damage of military importance has been reported.Finnish aircraft have bombed Terijoki, the seat of the puppet &quot; Governmentof Finland,-&apos; and some of the Islands taken over by the Russians. They7 also bombed the Leningrad-Murmansk railway.Finnish communiques state that 25 Russian aircraft were destroyed by theirnaval and air forces combined during the week.The Finnish Air Force has, in spite of its numerical inferiority (it comprises144 aircraft only), put up an outstanding performance.The Russians have so far failed to inflict damage of any consequence on military targets, and appear to be remarkably short of trained pilots, especially for night flying. In spite of numerous attacks on Finnish aerodromes, they allremain serviceable.Only four Finnish aircraft have been lost since the outbreak of war, and the morale of the Finnish Air Force is very high, except for real anxiety over theshortage of aircraft.[20539]
