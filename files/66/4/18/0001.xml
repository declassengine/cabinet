Printed for the War Cabinet. - December 1939.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (39) 168.TO  BE KEPT  UNDER  LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE GERMAN IRON-ORE  TRAFFIC.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I HAVE carefully studied the memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty, W.P. (39) 162 circulated to the War Cabinet on the 16th December,regarding the iron-ore traffic to Germany from the Norwegian port of Narvik,and. although the pioposal made therein raises great difficulties, as the FirstLord recognises. I should certainly not desire to take unnecessary objection toany course of action which could be shown to be vital to the prosecution orabbreviation of the war. I am. moreover, in full agreement, with the First Lordwhen he argues that we cannot fight this war on the basis of allowing Germanyto break all the rules while we keep them; and I feel, as I think all my colleagues would feel, that a distinction can justifiably be drawn between such violations of international law as, on the one hand, the torpedoing of merchant vesselswithout warning and, on the other, the infringement, without danger to humanlife, of national rights in territorial waters. I think it may also be assumed that public opinion both here and abroad has been deeply affected by the recentRussian aggression on Finland, for which Germany must share the responsibility.We may hope in consequence that, even in countries desiring to remain neutral,there is now a greater readiness than ever before to recognise the broad issues involved in this struggle, and perhaps, therefore, to judge more leniently of ourdisregard of rules which could justly claim observance only so long as thatobservance was general, and warfare was conducted with traditional regard forconventional practice.2. The present case, therefore, in my judgment, would fall to be decided inthe light of what might, after examination of all the relevant considerations onwhich other Departments and the Chiefs of Staff may advise, prove to be thebalance of advantage and disadvantage arising from any course of action proposed, even if it violated international law, provided that it was not in itselfinhumane or otherwise repugnant to morality. If, on such general examination,the advantage of taking the action proposed were held proved, I would accept adecision to take it on those grounds and proceed to consideration of the furtherpoint which would then arise, viz., the best method of making the decisioneffective.3. As I understand it the case for stopping the iron-ore traffic from Narvikto Germany by action inside Norwegian territorial waters rests on the facts thatGermany now requires at least some 9 million tons of Swedish iron-ore per annum,and that all of this cannot be exported to her through Swedish Baltic ports, owingto the main port, Lulea, being frozen in the winter, while accommodation further south is inadequate, so that a certain proportion of it must come through the port of Narvik and thence by ship along the Norwegian coast in territorial waters.10776   [20509]
The vital questions therefore are : (i) what is the difference between 9 million tonsand the amount which could be exported in a year through Swedish Baltic ports;and (ii) if this amount is not by itself sufficient to produce the result we want,what are the prospects of being able to stop the trade in the Baltic?4. The Ministry of Economic Warfare, in their memorandum of the18th December, estimate that the loss of the Narvik route would curtail Germany&apos;supply of ore during the four winter months by some 1 million tons, which, how-ever. could be largely made up if she still had the use of the Swedish ports afterApril next, when&quot;the Baltic will cease to be frozen, so that the total reduction inthe year would be comparatively small in fact, it appears from paragraph 9 inpart 1 of the memorandum that it would be practically nothing, since it is therestated that &quot; a resumption of deliveries from Lulea- when the ice has melted . . . .should enable Germany to increase her imports .... to a level which, evenwithout the use of Narvik, would bring her total Swedish imports to a figure ofat. least 9 million tons by the end of the first year of war.&quot; Would a temporaryreduction, therefore, of 1 million tons produce a sufficiently severe crisis inGerman by next spring to justify the disadvantages of bringing it about by themeans proposed. The Ministry of Economic Warfare themselves seem to havedoubts, for it is stated in paragraph 11 of the memorandum that &quot; the closure of Narvik alone might not cause more than acute embarrassment to Germany,&quot;whereas &quot; the closure of Narvik followed by a stoppage of exports via Lulea mightwell bring German industry to a standstill.&quot; In this connection it seems relevant to note that even during the four winter months about 300,000 tons a month of iron-ore are shipped to Germany from the more southerly Baltic ports ofOxelosund and Gavley, &amp;c.; and I presume that, if the Narvik trade were stopped,attempts would certainly be made to increase these shipments. The figures for october last show that these ports then shipped more than half as much asLulea 294.700 as against 570.000 tons.1 5. As was discovered during the recent negotiations with Sweden for a war trade agreement, there is at present no means of preventing exports of ore toGermany through Swedish ports, so long as Sweden is not herself involved in war;and the utmost concession on this point which could be extracted from the Swedishnegotiators of the agreement was an unofficial promise to do what was possible toprevent an actual increase in the exports through refusing to improve railway and port facilities, &amp;c. It would seem, therefore, that the only way to cut off theseexports would be to involve Sweden in war. either against Germany, or against russia over Finland, in which latter case the exports, though not necessarilystopped, would inevitably be very greatly curtailed.6. The conclusion would seem to be that, unless we can be fairly sure ofinterrupting not only the traffic from Narvik, but also that from Lulea and other/ Swedish ports, we can hardly count on achieving, by the interruption of the narvik traffic alone, a result substantial enough to outweigh both the materialdisadvantages summarised in the letter from the Minister of Economic warfare covering the above-mentioned memorandum from his Department, and alsothe imponderable reactions which may be expected from Norway and Sweden, and,indeed, from every neutral country.7. If, nevertheless, it were decided that action against theNarvic tradewas essential, as part of a larger and practicable scheme for stopping the bulkof German supplies, the further question arises whether this action as regardsNarvik should be taken by means of laying a mine-field, as now proposed, or by sending our ships to patrol inside Norwegian territorial waters, as the First lord had formerly suggested. I gather that the former is now preferred to the la,ttermethod, because there seems reason to believe that the Norwegians may attemptto escort trade through their territorial waters with their own naval forces, sothat the interception of the iron ore traffic by British ships might involve anincident with a Norwegian escort. It is not confirmed, however, that the norwegians have this intention; and even if it were practicable for them withtheir very small naval forces to establish a regular escort system capable of protecting all the trade passing along the Norwegian coast, it seems doubtfulwhether the risk of incidents with a convoy inside Norwegian territorial watersis much greater than that likely to arise from the adoption of the mine-layingscheme.
8. For we must assume, either that the Norwegians will acquiesce in ourillegal actions, or that they will be so incensed by them that they will bedetermined to protect the trade at all costs. In the former event they will notresist if we interfere with their convoys, wherever they are: but in the latterevent they will resist, and if we lay mines and force their convoys.to come outside territorial waters at one point, they may well declare that we have forfeited our right to treat the convoys at that point as if they were on the high seas, and willresist there just as if they were in territorial waters.9. There is also the further danger that the Norwegian authorities maystart mine-sweeping operations; and if this were to result in some of -theirmine-sweepers being blown up and the men killed, the &quot; incident &quot; would be quiteas serious, if not more so, than if it arose out of interference with a convoy.10. If, in consequence of our adoption of the patrolling system, a ship were captured in Norwegian territorial waters, it would be open to the norwegian government to make a claim in the Prize Court for her release on that ground,in which case we should have to try to persuade the Prize Court that the capturewas justified in view of German violations of Norwegian neutrality. It is,however, conceivable that the Norwegian Government might make a similar claimif the vessel, though actually captured on the high seas, had been forced out of territorial waters by a minefield laid in those waters, and, if so, the above con-sideration, while perhaps an argument in favour of the minefield method, is nota particularly strong one. In any case, this difficulty might be reduced by making-captures at the point or points where, I understand, ships normally have difficultyin proceeding through territorial waters, if this is practicable.11. Finally, there is a psychological consideration which is of importancein dealing with the Norwegians, who are an obstinate people and more difficultto handle than other Scandinavians, but have legalistic minds and are prone to seek for any technical excuse even a quibble to justify action really dictated by their own interests. There is now evidence that German submarines aresinking merchant ships in Norwegian territorial waters, and that the Norwegiannaval forces are not in a position to stop this indeed, that is the sole reason why they are believed to contemplate a convoy system; and if we were to statethat we must take action in their waters because German submarines were operating in them, and tell them privately at the same time that they would bewell advised not to start a convoy system for fear of incidents with our patrols,they might possibly regard their consciences as salved if they acquiesced in thesituation without taking any positive counter-measures, though they would doubtless raise a great outcry. If, on the other hand, we were simply to laymines in their waters, which could not possibly be represented as a defensivemeasure or even as a reprisal for any specific German act, they would be facedwith a naked act of force in clear violation of their sovereign rights and ofinternational law, and would be left unprovided with any excuse for not reactingagainst it as violently as their own instincts and German instigation would impelthem to do.12. There is, after all, a certain rough justice in the argument : &quot; You havebeen unable to look after your own territorial waters, with the result that our ships and neutral ships have been sunk in them by the Germans in a mostinhumane manner. We therefore claim that we are entitled to operate in thosewaters, as the Germans have done, though our operations will be humane and directed merely to preventing the supply of an essential war material to anenemy who has been guilty of every offence against humanity and the laws of war,including the sinking of Norwegian ships -with the loss of Norwegian lives.&quot;H.Foreign Office, December 20, 1939.
