TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.kj, C R E T.b.(39) 173*Abo Paper No.hTo.S. (59)172)COPY KTO. AWAR CABINETASSISTANCE TO FINLAND AND THE bCANDINAVIANCOUNTRIES.Report by the   Chiefs of Staff Committee.The War Cabinet at their meeting on the 22nd Decemberinvited us to consider -&quot;(a) The character and extent of the indirect assistance which thiscountry could render to Finland,with particular reference to thedespatch of technical missions and the supply of material:(b) What assistance could, in practice,bex v cu   oOSweden and Norwayagainst the possible consequences to them of such direct or indirectassistance as they might afford to Finland:&quot;Character and Extent of Assistance to Finland.2. At Appendix A we attach a list showing the naval,military and air equipment asked for by Finland and theextent to which supply is being met.      We also attachat Appendix B a note by the Air Staff on the Supplyof Aircraft to Finland, from which it will be seen thatin addition to the despatch of the 30 Gladiators andthe 28 Gauntlets,  it is proposed to supply 12 Blenheimbombers.      The present intention is that Finnishpilots should take over the Blenheims in England, but inorder to save time&apos;we put forward the suggestion thatthe Foreign Office might consider whether there wouldbe any objection to these aircraft being flown byBritish crews in plain clothes to Norway or Sweden,where they could, be taken over by Finnish crews.Other measures.3. The list of requirements in Appendix A representthe demands which Finland have so far made upon us..

There are, however, certain other measures which we might take to assist Finland, although they have not&quot;been specifically proposed by the Finns themselves.Volunteer aircraft Crews .4. we suggest that  a limited humber  if volunteer aircrews should be called for from the Service nnc. sent to Fin-lnnd in pin in clothes.. They wouklhqve to be called for without unduepublicity, but they might be 01  great assistanceto the Finns apart from the undoubted good effect which their presence in Finland v/ould have on Finnishmorale.Polish Submarines.5. Three Polish Submarines have been interned in stockholm.    These are of French and Butch manufacture,and it would be possible to provide for them fromallied sources the necessary torpedoes and ammunitionwhich they would require for operations.    The ForeignOffice might approach the Swedish Government with aview    to releasing them for operations against theRussian Fleet in the BalticS. ^part from the measures proposed above and the equipment which we already propose to    hand over to finland, we wish to point out that demands from finland,  Norway and Sweden for war material arearriving daily and those listed in Appendix A cannotbe regarded as final.     ;e have therefore,  to consider our attitude regarding further demands.7. Hitherto when considering the supply of warmaterial to potential allies we have for the mostpart kept in the foreground the prior needs of the defences of the United Kingdom,   the security of France,and the requirements of countries,  such as Turkey,with whom we have contractual    obligations.    Hostof the sources from which war material can be drawnhave already been tapped and it is evident that no appreciable increase in our supplies of equipment to finland can be made unless we are prepared to makeconsiderable sacrifices either in France, or at home,or in the Liiddle East.8* This brings us to the crux of the problem whichis whether we ought to.regard Finland&apos;s struggle against Russia as the possible prelude to the spreadingof operations to Scandinavia.This is a question on which a decision canonly be taken by the War Cabinet in the light ofthe wider appreciation which we are in the courseof preparing&apos;on the subject of stopping Swedish iron ore supplies to Germany.

Technical Mission.9. As regards the despatch of missionsto Finland,    we have no hesitation insaying that,  in our opinion,  the Finns donot require a Military Mission,  i.e. a professional, body to help then to directtheir campaign against the Russians.10. The Question of a Technical Missionis different.      Up to date we have notsupplied any military material of aparticular complicated sort.      If, however,we do so in future, the Finns may requireadvice regarding both the operation andmaintenance of such equipment.     Anti-aircraft guns and predictors are an example of what we have in mind.      It would, nodoubt, be possible to arrange suchassistanceo     The subject is one whichwould now be discussed with the FinnishAttache in London and our Military and AirAttaches in Scandinavia.      ,.7e should askwhat forms of assistance they require and make it clear that we shall do our best tomeet their requirements.Assistance tpM Sweden and Norway.11. We have been asked what assistance could be given to Sweden and Norway againstthe possible consequences to them of suchdirect or indirect assistance as theymight afford to Finland.12. Y/e do not feel in a position at . thepresent time to give a comprehensive and fully balanced answer/er to this question,  sincethe considerations involved must inevitably be  affected by the comprehensive appreciation of all the implications of stopping iron ore from Sweden reaching Cermany, which weare preparing as a separate paper,13. There ore, however, certain generalpoints which we think stand out clearly.14. The most likely action by Germanyagainst Norway and Sweden would bethe seizure on Norwegian and Swedishshipping in the Baltic and attacks on thisshipping in the North Sea   md the   atlantic and sea-borne    land attack on southern norway  \nu Sweden.    It is possible thatshe may by air attack on the cities ofSouthern Scandinavia attempt to compelthem to submit to her demands and so avoid the dispersal of force and effort whichland invasion would involve.

15o As a counter to the above forms of attack all we can say at the present time is that we could not directly protect theSouthern Scandinavian cities against air attack, nor could we protect Scandinavianshipping in the Baltic although we could give it protection outside.-     iioreoverwe could not prevent a land invasion ofSouthern Norway and Sweden;16o It should &quot;be pointed out, however,that if Germany combed Scandinavian citiesand invadeo. their territories this wouldresult in the  immediate loss to Germany ofthe Swedish iron ore, until she had. beenable completely to over-run Sweden andrecondition the mines and railways whichthe Swedes would undoubtedly have sabotaged.&apos;A. should;  therefore, make it  clear at anearly opportunity that air attack on Scandinavian-riftvian citj us would be-regarded in the samelight as an  *ir attack on Great Britain andwould invite r similar retaliation on our part.Conclusions and recommendations.17. The provision of war material to finland, on any scale greater than that atpresent in hand is dependent upon adecision as to whether such provision should be made at the expense of our security elsewhere,  or  of our capacity tohelp Sweden and Norway should the major operations to prevent the export of swedish iron ore to Germany be ultimately decided upon.     A final decision on this point,however, must rest on  the results of our examination of the military implications of our whole policy in Scandinavia,  and upon the attitude of Norway and Sweden asmay be disclosed by the results of the approach which has now been made by theForeign Office,18. Meanwhile, the Finnish need is urgent and if the opportunity is nowallowed to slip by, we may lose norwegian and Swedish confidence in our ability and determination to help them if they are,in turn,  threatened,  and thus prejudice our ability subsequently to stop theexport of Swedish iron ore to Germany.

19.        &apos;v*e recommend -(a) That we should meet the demands of Finlandfor war material as set out in the listin .\ppend:.x A to this Report as far as available supplies will permit.(b) That the question of the despatch of a technical mission to Finland should bediscussed with the Finnish Attache inLondon and, if necessary, in consult-:.tionwith our military and Air Attachesin Scandinavia.(c) That the question of sending volunteers,particularly trained aircraft crews,to Finland should be examined.(d) That the Foreign Office should be invitedto approach the Swedes with a view toinducing them&quot; to release three Polishsubmarines now in Stockholm for operationsi in the Baltic.(e) That the question of further assistanceto Finland f over ana -above the existingFinnish da;., aids, ana to Sweden and Norway,snould bo re-ex ::uinoc  in th . light cf th juidar appreciation which wo are now pr.:-paring on th:: subject of th j stoppage of Sw\dish iron or., to Germany.(f) That we should make it clear atan early opportunity that air attacks on Scandinavian cities would beregarded in the same light as an air attack on Great Britain and would invite a rimilar retaliation on our part.(Signed)    DUDLEY POUNDH.R.  17 army(for C.

APPENDIX B.175Air Staff Note on Supply of immediate assistance to Finland.1. We are already supplying the Finns with a considerablenumber of aircraft.   We are despatching to them the thirtyGladiators they asked for,  and have added twenty-eightGauntlets released by the Union of South Africa.     It isproposed to supply the first twelve Blenheim bombers for whichthey have asked,  and these will be ready for despatch by thetime the Finnish pilots arrive to take them over.     Wesuggest the Foreign Office should consider whether there is any objection tea    these aircraft being flown by British crews inplain clothes to Norway or Sweden where they could be taken over by Finnish crews.2. We cannot advise any further assistance of this nature.The Finnish Government have now asked for an additionaltwelve Blenheims, making a total of twenty-four.    Our own position however is by no means satisfactory in respect ofBlenheim reserves.   We are faced also with the urgent necessityof rearming existing squadrons with long-nosed Blenheims and of expanding our home based Blenheim squadrons.   Moreover we haveno long-nosed Blenheims in the Middle East and the aircraft of this type are essential if we are to carry out air operations against Baku0     As regards fighters we are far &quot;foelowthe standard of strength required both in England and France.The Gladiator is now out of production, and the despatch even of thirty to Finland? has reduced our reserves to a dangerousdegree.      This is the type with which our Squadrons in theMiddle East are equipped.3e There are no obsolete aircraft of a type suitablefor operations in Finland other than those which areperforming an essential function in the training organisation.

And it is extremely doubtful whether,  even if they couldbe made available, they could effectively be operated in finland, since the Finns have no experience of them, norare there any spare parts or maintenance facilities forthem in Finland-, as there are for Blenheims.4ft Actually it is doubtful whether the Finnish AirForce could make use of more than those aircraft with whichwe are now supplying them, at least for some time.   Finally,it must be remembered that we have other pressing demands upon us, such as from Turkey;    and if the situation developsin Scandinavia we shall no doubt be met with fuller demands from the Norwegians and Swedes.50 The conclusion is that from the Air Force point ofview we can offer no more assistance in material to Finlandthan we are already affording while adhering to presentpolicyD
