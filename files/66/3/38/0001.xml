COPY NO.    C^CfWAR CABINET.DIVERSION OP SHIPPING.Report by the ChiefB of Staff Committee.The War Cabinet at their meeting on the 23rdOctober, 1939, (W.M. (39) 57th Conclusions, Minute ll),when they had under consideration the diversion ofshipping from East Coast to West Coast ports, agreed:-&quot;(a)   that, for the time being, instead of allshipping being diverted to West Coast   Ports,ships should be allowed to use East coast ports in special cases where this wasnecessary to avoid substantially increasedexpense, or delay that would have serious effects on production;(b)   That, in the meantime, the examination intothe possibility of effecting improvements inthe capacity of the Western Ports and the related transport facilities should bepushed on as rapidly as possible.&quot;2.        In pursuance of Conclusion (a) above, diversion ofshipping to West Coast ports has been considerablydiminished, although enemy mine-laying activities haverecently caused one homeward-bound convoy intended for london to be diverted almost in its entirety to the West.Despite this limitation of diversion, however, we areinformed that import and export programmes, labour and therevenue of the ports on the East Coast have been seriously affected.   Delays to shipping for various reasons areextensive, and a considerable reduction on the normaltonnage using these ports will be inevitable under war conditions.

3.       We have recently examined this question from the strategical point of view and now recommend as ageneral policy:-(a) That diversion of shipping from the east coast ports should in future be imposedonly if forced upon us by enemy action.(b) That unless serious losses occur, noarbitrary interf erence  should be placed upon the flow of shipping, subject tothe condition that at no time should anabnormal amount of tonnage be allowedinto any East Coast port.4.        At the same time v;e desire to emphasise theimportance of improving the capacity of the westernports and their related transport facilities, which are referred to in the second of the War Cabinet&apos;conclusions quoted above.     It is impossible to foretellwhen complete diversion of shipping to the West may be forced upon us, and we feel strongly that nothing shouldbe left undone in preparing for such a contingency.(Signed)   C.L.H. NET/ALL.&quot; DUDLEY POUND.&quot; H.E.S. MASSY.(For C.I.G.S.)Central War Soon,26th November, 1939.
