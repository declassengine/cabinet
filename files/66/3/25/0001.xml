This paper will also be circulated as DJM.V. (39) 3.W. S. C.Admiralty, November 17, 1939.AUSTRALIAN NAVAL DEFENCE.(WlNTEB 1939.)SINGAPORE is a fortress armed with five 15-inch guns, and garrisoned by nearly 20,000 men. It could only be taken after a siege by an army of at least50,000 men, who would have to be landed in the marshes and jungle of the Isthmuswhich connects it with the mainland. As Singapore is as far from Japan asSouthampton is from New York, the operation of moving a Japanese army withall its troopships and maintaining it with men and munitions daring a siegewould be forlorn. Moreover, such a siege, which should last at least four or five months, would be liable to be interrupted if at any time Great Britain chose tosend a superior fleet to the scene. In this case the besieging army would becomeprisoners of war. It is not considered possible that the Japanese, who are aprudent people and reserve their strength for the command of the Yellow Seasand China, in which they are fully occupied, would embark upon such a madenterprise.2. Even less likely is the invasion of Australia by Japan. To do this japan would have to despatch and subsequently maintain a large army mote than2,000 miles from home, with the possibility that at any time a British fleet would arrive to cut the communications; in which case all would be lost. Such an operation in its political aspects -would certainly be resented by the United States,hut as long as there is a well-armed Australian military force and a superiorBritish fleet in being in any part of the world, it is needless to suppose that suchan enterprise would be attempted.[20334]
It is always possible that a long-range submarine or raiding cruiser might turn up and insult Australian shores by firing a few shells into some seaport city,or cause temporary inconvenience by disturbing the coastal trade. But japan would hardly be likely to reap any result except Australian resentment from such escapades.3. The power of a predominant fleet is exercised simultaneously in all quarters of the globe in which it has bases. This is irrespective of the stationit occupies at any given moment, provided that it is not permanently tied tothat station. At the beginning of the present War, the Admiralty had to eon-template fighting Italy in the Mediterranean as well as Germany and the U-boats in the North Sea and the Atlantic. This was thought to be not beyond our strength. In these circumstances the first step obviously was to beat the italians and recover the command of the Mediterranean. With the French Fleet, whichis highly efficient, and as strong as the Italian, this ought to have been achieved in a few months. Meanwhile, Singapore, even if it had been attacked, could haveresisted. However, if the result in the Mediterranean had been long delayed,or the German and U-boat pressure had become too severe, the Admiralty ooaidhave closed the Mediterranean at Gibraltar and at the Suez Canal, and, sacrificingcur important interests in that area, proceeded to the relief of Singapore, or. ofcourse, a fortiori to the aid of Australia supposing she was the victim of a seriousattack.4. Now, however, that Italy is neutral and may even became &amp; friend,the British Fleet has become again entirely mobile. Only a very few capital ships are needed in the North Sea to contain the small German Fleet and supportthe blockade from Scotland to Greenland. All the rest are now ranging freelyabout the oceans, either on convoy work, or hunting raiders. Although it is notat present within our power to place a superior battlefleet in the Home waters of japan, it would be possible, if it were necessary, to place a squadron of battleshipsa? Singapore, sufficient to act as a major deterrent on Japanese action so far fromI Home, or to send capital ships to Australian waters. This would, of course, beI done from the moment that the danger to either Singapore or Australia devolped in a mariner which made their protection a real and practical war need. TheAdmiralty accepts the full responsibility of defending Australia or Singaporefrom a Japanese attack on a large scale, and after containing the German heavyships they have forces at their disposal for these essential purposes. The chiefdifficulty would arise from the stringency in destroyer strength; but this situation should improve as our building programmes develop and as the U-boat is masteredby our attack. It is, however, wise to use every vessel we possess to the highest possible advantage in the fighting area, and only to move them to other waterswhen the War moves thither. The Admiralty are, therefore, most grateful to theCommonwealth Government for the loyal and clairvoyant strategy which has tothe uninstructed eye denuded Australia of naval force. In particular, theassistance of the Australian destroyers is of invaluable aid. But we wish tomake it plain that we Tegard the defence of Australia, and of Singapore, as astepping-stone to Australia, as ranking next to the mastering of the principalfleet to which we are opposed, and that if the choice were presented of defendingAustralia against a serious attack, or sacrificing British interests in theMediterranean, our duty to Australia would take precedence.It seems very unlikely, however that this bleak choice will arise during thenext year or two, which is what we have to consider at the present time.5. Finally, it must be pointed out that we are now at the lowest point ofourstrength compared to Germany and Japan. As our new battleships now being built come into service, the relative position should steadily improve.There are no naval grounds, therefore, always assuming that the UnitedStates is our friend, which should prevent the despatch of an Australian anavto the decisive battlefields, where their name stands so high.w. s. c.November 17, 1939.
