In accordance with the decision reached by the WarCabinet at their Meeting   on 15th November, the military co-operation-ordination Committee has examined the various proposals and requests submitted to the Service Departments byGeneral Sikorski, the Polish Prime Minister, and consideredthe general policy which should be followed in respect ofthem.GENERAL SIKORSKI&apos;S MAIN PROPOSALS.2. General Sikorski outlined what he described as his&quot;chief proposals&quot; in a letter to the Secretary of State forWar on the 31st October, 1939.     These and our recomraend-ations on them are as follows:-(I)       To form 3 to 5 Infantry Divisions in France.3. This is a matter for the French, but we suggestthat they should be requested to keep us in touch with what they are doing.x War Cabinet (39) 84th Conclusions,Minute 6.copy NO

(II) To form 1 to 2 Divisions In Canada.4.        Me attach importance to this proposal on both military and political grounds, although ve understandthat the Canadian Government is at present disinclinedto look favourably Upon it.     The Secretary of State forV,&apos;ar has undertaken to take up  the proposition with theSecretary of state for Dominion Affairs.(III) To form 15 to 20 Air Force Squadrons and thecorresponding formations of a.A. Artillery,either in England or in France according to decisions which will be taken.5.        As regards the formation of Air Force Squadrons,agreement has been reached with the French whereby polish air Force Fighter personnel shall be allotted to Franceand their Bo;.iber personnel to this country.     The lattercomprise some 300 pilots and 2,000 other ranks, who are ready to come to this country as soon as the order isgiven.     As a start the Air Ministry has made arrangements to form:-Two (First Line) Medium Bomber SquadronsandTwo (Reserve) Medium Bomber Squadrons.6.        These Squadrons will be equipped with Battleaircraft and their flying and maintenance personnel willbe Poles, but they will be strengthened on the adrainis-trative side by an infusion of British personnel.V.        A number of other questions of detail have alreadybeen settled direct between the Air Ministry and thePolish Air Attache in London.

8.        The question of the formation of Anti-AircraftArtillery forms part of other demands which the Poleswill make upon the War Office.     These were expressed ingeneral terms hy General Sikorski in an interview whichhe had with the Secretary of State-for War, who asked thathe should specify them in detail in a written statement which is now av/aited.     The supply of this type of equipment will clearly present difficulties.(IV) To form a large armoured unit in Prance.9.         The same remarks apply as in the case of (i) above,but it is thought that General Sikorski is hoping that weshall be able to supply at least a proportion of the equipment for this unitc.     In view of our own requirementsthis will clearly present difficulties.(V) To ensure that the Polish Naval Forces pursue their co-operation with the British Royal Navy.10.       The Polish Naval Forces attached to the Royal Navycomprise three destroyers and two submarines with theircrews.     These units are being preserved as Polish entities,and the existing arrangements for their employment are satisfactory.CONDITIONS OF SERVICE.11.       The conditions of service under which Polishpersonnel serving with forces formed in this countryraise a number of administrative problems, e.g. pay and

allowances0 pensions to dependants, etc., discipline andso forth.  Agreement has been reached with the Treasury asto the rates of pay   to be paid to Polish Air Force personnel,and as to the conditions under which pensions will be paidto their dependants.     The Treasury has expressed the viewthat the cost of equipping and maintaining the Polishsquadrons, and of the pay and allowances etc., of theirpersonnel, should be finally charged to the credit already established in this country in favour of the Polish Government,12.       Personnel of the Polish detachment working with theRoyal Navy are being paid at Polish rates of pay by means of advances from the Admiralty, v/hich are, in turn, recovered from the Polish Embassy.    An agreement embodying thisarrangement has been drawn up to be signed on the18th November.13*        Inevitably there will be some disparity between theconditions of service of Polish personnel serving with ourforoes, and those serving with the French, but we take theview that this difference must be accepted and should not beallowed to delay a speedy fulfilment of our own arrangements.POLISH IDENTITY OF UNITS.lk*        General Sikorski has attached particular importance topreserving the Polish character of the units which are to be formed in this country, and in France, as evidence of Poland&apos;scontinued part in the war.     Special consideration has beengiven to this question by the Air Ministry in connexion with the bombing Squadrons which are to be attached to the Royal AirForce.    As already stated, these units will be equipped with british aircraft, but after careful consideration the AirMinistry have decided,that it would be preferable that theyshould carry R.A.F. markings, and that their personnel should

be dressed in R.A.F. uniform.     They see no objectionshowever, to the personnel bearing a special insignia asa mark of their Polish nationality.15.        Consideration has been given to the question of the oath which they shall take and, -prima facie, no objection is seen to an oath of allegiance both to His Majesty andto Poland.POLISH ASSOCIATION &apos;ffITH THE SUPREME WAP COUNCIL.16.        General Sikorski has made a special point of the representation of Poland, if not on the Supreme War Council,at least on some body as will ensure that Polish military requirements receive an adequate hearing.     There are obvious objections to granting Poland a permanent place in.theSupreme War Council.     During the last war Great Britain,Prance, Italy and the United States of America were alonegranted permanent representation on the Supreme War Council;and such smaller Powers as Belgium and Roumania were onlyrepresented when their special interests were underconsideration.    We are of the opinion that the same rule should apply, and that Poland should not, therefore, be permanently represented on the Supreme War Council.     if general Sikorski should press his claim, the case of Belgiumin the last war could be quoted to support our refusal.17o       Apart, however, from the question of Polishrepresentation on the Supreme War Council, General Sikorskimade a request to the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence that a Polish Military Officer of suitable rank

should he associated with the Anglo-French PermanentUilltary Representatives In London.    \7e see noobjection to this provided that the French agree, andthat it is clearly understood that the Polish representative will be invited  only to Meetings atwhich questions affecting Poland or Polish personnel are under consideration.AGREE! JET  /ITH THE POLISH GOVDRIE11HT.18.        Finally, we invite attention to the proposal byGeneral Sikorski that formal agreements should be drawnup codifying the conditions of service of Polish Unitsservinc alongside the French and British Forces.19.        *7e take the view that a comprehensive agreementembracing the various points referred to in paragraphs11-17 above would require very careful drafting and couldnot be concluded at short notice.20.        The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence has accordingly asked General tsikorski to suggest the formof an agreement in very general terms which would be acceptable to him to cover the needs of the immediatefuture and suggested that agreements on variousadministrative matters such as pay, discipline etc.should be concluded and annexed to the original agreement,as addenda.

SUMMARY. &apos;21.       We summarise our conclusions and recommendations as follows :-(i)   We strongly favour the proposal that Polish units should he formed in this country, in Canada, andin Prance;   and we recommend that this shouldhe pushed on as fast as possible by theDepartments concerned.(ii)   We ask the War Cabinet to endorse the arrangements which have already been made by the Air ministry for temedJately raising two First Line and twoReserve Bomber Squadrons as Polish units in thiscountry.(ill)   The precise details of Polish Army requirements are not yet known, but General Sikorski hasbeen invited to submit them in writing tothe Secretary of State for War.(lv)   The existing arrangements for the employmentof Polish Naval forces now serving withthe Royal Navy are satisfactory, and willcontinue.(v)   We recommend the acceptance of the arrangements which have been agreed by the Treasurywith the Admiralty and the Air Ministry,regarding the pay and allowances etc., ofthe Polish personnel who will be serving in this country;   and, in particular,approval of the Treasury view that the costof equipping and maintaining the PolishBomber Squadrons, and of the pay and allowances, etc., of their personnel, shouldbe finally charged to the credit already established in this country in favour ofthe Polish Government.(vi)   We recommend that the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should endeavour to persuade the Canadian Government to agree to the formationof one or two Polish Divisions in Canada.(vii)   We recommend that, subject to the approvalof the French, a Polish Officer of suitablerank should be associated with the   Anglo-French Permanent Military Representatives inLondon, on the understanding that he should beinvited only to those meetings at which Polishquestions are under consideration.

(viii)    We BUggest that information of the steps which we are taking inthese matters should hecommunicated to the French throughthe channel of the Anglo-FrenchLiaison Section, and that they,for their part, should he asked togive us reciprocal information&apos; of what is being done in France.(rnt&apos;d)C.on behalf of theSub-Committee.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.18th November, 1939.
