For some time past the method of meeting the air requirements of theArmy for &quot; direct support&quot; has been under discussion, and it was the earnestdesire of the War Office that an early settlement should be reached in principleso that, if possible, the mtervening months between now and the Spring couldbe used to bund the required organization. --The Land Forces Committee at their first meeting upon this subject/(conclusion (&amp;))* put into train certain enquiries relating to the drawing up of aspecification of an aircraft suitable for mass production.It was realized that, although the implementing of this conclusion must betreated as a matter of urgency, some little time would elapse before a report could be made to the Committee, and before production could begin.In the meantime (conclusion (a)) the Secretary of State for Air was; toexamine and report to the Committee &quot;... on the means by which an additional250 fust line aircraft, suitable for the close support of the Army and acting under .its orders (together with the necessary pilots and reserves) can be made available by the Spring of 1940 &quot; *2. It now appears that the Secretary of State for Air contests this conclusion in principle and is not wilting to place additional machines at thedisposal of the Army to act under its orders. I understand that he would only be prepared to continue the present system whereunder the Army couldask for these machines for employment on a particular operation.3. In a paper which I had laid before the Land Forces Committee(L.F. (39) 19) I had made it clear that this spasmodic allocation of aircraft forthe Army would never be satisfactory, and it must, I submit to my colleagues,be axiomatic that (to employ words once used by Lord Balfour) &quot; A fightingdepartment should as far as possible have the whole responsibility (subject to treasury and Cabinet control) of the instruments it uses, the personnel itcommands, and the operations which it undertakes &quot;.&quot; Direct support&quot; aircraft like any other Army supporting weapon, must,if the Army is to fulfil its functions adequately, be continually under Armycontrol for the purposes of training and action. It is a weapon of opportunity and must therefore be a permanent part of the mechanism directly under theCommander-in-Chief in the Field.4. I attach at Appendix A four extracts from good authorities which show how essential it is that the Army should not be deprived of the oprx)rtunhy of developing a tactic available to the forces to which we are opposed.* Conclusions of the 4th Meeting of the Land Forces Committee held on 23rd October, 1939.
&quot;&quot; &quot;51 Throughout the last war the Army bad control of its own essentialaircraft, and even at the conclusion of the war the following Army Order(A.0.100,1918) was in operation: &quot; (i) The Army Council will indicate to the Air Council the number of squadrons of the various classes required for all military commandsat home and abroad; where necessary, they will inform the air council of any increases or decreases which the3r consider should bemade.(ii) The Air Council will organize and equip these forces and band the mover as complete organizations to the military commanders. Theywill maintain them in personnel and equipment........................&apos;6. With the decline of the Army into what can only be described as apolicing force, its right to indent for its air requirements.fell into abeyance.With the decision taken before the war to recruit a continental army the questionbecame important again, but discussions by the outbreak of hostilities had notled to an agreement7. Believing that the establishment of a clear principle can alone enablethe slow processes of deliberation and argument to be replaced by action, I ask my colleagues if they will give to the Army an opportunity to work out the tactical application of the weapons necessary for its success in modem warand to agree that the Army shall have the right to order and to control theaircraft which it requires in the same way in which it orders and controls theother weapons which are essential to it . -8. If my colleagues so agree, the Army would be content to start with an initial force, however small, and for the purpose of assisting the Air ministry in its admitted difficulties to provide forthwith at least 100 partly trained pilotsfrom its own ranks, and to begin the assembling of a ground organization.We would require at all stages the help of the Royal Air Force.9. I would also ask that the War Office be authorized to acquire civilmachines to form the nucleus of a troop-carrying transport service which would greatly increase the effectiveness, by adding to the mobility, of our Middle EastReserve.:10. Agreement to the moderate demands which I make would go far toremove a feeling, growing ever more prevalent in the Army, that it lacks anessential arm of its equipment and that it is being sorely hampered by thepresent restraint upon its natural evolution.L. H-B.The War Office,2nd November, 1939.
APPENDIX Ai. Extract from a directs; issued by General Vuillenun, Commander-in-Chief of the French air Forces, on 16th September, 1939. .. - &apos;&quot; I advised yon that the bomber forces of the German Air Force had carried out attacks in Poland during 2nd September at. generally speaking, a height of less than 30 metres byflights of three aircraft.&quot;2. Extract from the Report of the Military Mission to Poland by the Army representatives.(c) &quot; In addition to normal reconnaissance duties, German air forces were used extensivelywith the army for two special purposes: (i) To provide covering fire for the attacks of armoured formations by low-flying attackswith bombs and machine-guns. These had considerable moral as well as physicaleffects.(ii) To &apos;* smother &quot; Polish counter-attacks before they could be launched.  Apparentlyreconnaissance aircraft wrjuld report the assembly of troops for a counter-attack,and bomber aircraft would be despatched at once to break it up. So general and effective was this tactic that eventually Polish counter-attacks were always stagedin the dark.The use of aircraft for this purpose necessitates the employment in recon-naissance craft of officers trained to recognize the implications of troop activity in the forward areas.&quot;3. Extract from the Report of the Air Attache working with the Military Mission to Poland.&quot; It seems beyond doubt that this cooperation had an enormous influence on the outcome of the war on the ground quite apart from the destruction of communication with the higher command in the field and with Polish G.H.Q. German infantry attacks (were) made simultaneously with low bombing and M.G. attacks on the Polish infantry facing thern.&quot;4. Extracts from an article by &quot; A Military Correspondent &quot; in the &quot; Times &quot;, 25th October,1539.german method in attack&quot;... the type of offensive advocated by German writers and carried out in the Polishcampaign is largely an adaptation to improved armament of that envisaged in the instructions issued for the offensive of March, 191S. Storm troops were to move in the van, followed byskirmishing lines and small composite forces of all arms; aircraft were to fly obliquely to the front and dive over the hostile infantry, which they were to attack with machine-guns and evenbombs ...&quot;the polish campaigx&quot;... Tanks and armoured cars to a large extent took the place of the storm troops of March,ioiS. Once again, the fastest set the pace; once again, breaches were vigorously exploited; once again, touch with the enemy rather tnan touch with the flanks was the goal. The tanks were certainly not tied to the infantry; in fact, they frequently left it far behind, in some cases perhapsscores of miles. Their salvation lay in their close co-operation with the overwhelmingly superiorGerman aircraft which enabled them to transgress with impunity every rule of prudence. Theaircraft kept them informed of Polish dispositions, protected them from interference by Polishaircraft, bombed centres of resistance which confronted them, swooped low and engaged withnrachine-gun fire the infantry which attempted to oppose them, and even broke up counter-attacksdirected against them, often before these were actually launched. The tanks in return distractedthe attention of the defence from the aircraft and permitted them to manceuvre at very low altitudes.&quot;(B39/8) $5 11/39 w.ojp. 4oz8
