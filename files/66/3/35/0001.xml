Printed for the War Cabinet.  November 1939.SECRET. -&apos;yyCopy No.W.P. (39) 185.     /TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to: ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND NAVAL DEFENCE.(Winter 1939.)I CIRCULATE herewith for the consideration of my colleagues, amemorandum on Australian and New Zealand Naval Defence. -SINGAPORE is a fortress armed with five 15-inch guns, and garrisoned by nearly 20,000 men. It could only be taken after a siege by an army of at least50,000 men, who would have to be landed in the marshes and jungle of the Isthmuswhich connects it with the mainland. As Singapore is as far from Japan asSouthampton is from New York, the operation of moving a Japanese army withall its troopships and maintaining it with men and munitions during a siegewould be forlorn. Moreover, such a siege, which should last at least four or five months, would be liable to be interrupted if at any time Great Britain chose tosend a superior fleet to the scene. In this case the besieging army would becomeprisoners of war. It is not considered possible that the Japanese, who are aprudent people and reserve their strength for the command of the Yellow Seasand China, in which they are fully occupied, would embark upon such a madenterprise. &quot;2. Even less likely is the invasion of Australia or New Zealand by Japan.To do this Japan would have to despatch and subsequently maintain a large armymore than 3,000 miles from home, with the possibility that at any time a british fleet would arrive to cut the communications; in which case all would be lost.Such an operation in its political aspects would certainly be resented by theUnited States, but as long as there is a well-armed Australian military force anda superior British fleet in being in any part of the world, it is needless to suppose that such an enterprise would be attempted.It is always possible that a long-range submarine or raiding cruiser might turn up and insult Australian or New Zealand shores by firing a few shells into some seaport city, or cause temporary inconvenience by disturbing the coastal trade. But Japan would hardly be likely to reap any result except resentmentfrom such escapades.3.  The power of a predominant fleet is exercised simultaneously in all quarters of the globe in which it has bases.   This is irrespective of the station[20353]Admiralty. November 21, 1939.W. S. C.
it occupies at any given moment, provided that it is not permanently tied tothat station. At the beginning of the present War, the Admiralty had to con-template fighting Italy in the Mediterranean as well as Germany and the U-boats in the North Sea and the Atlantic. This was thought to be not beyond our strength. In these circumstances the first step obviously -was to beat the italians and recover the command of the Mediterranean. With the French Fleet, whichis highly efficient, and as strong as the Italian, this ought to have been achieved in a tew months. Meanwhile, Singapore, even if it had been attacked, could haveresisted. However, if the result in the Mediterranean had been long delayed,or the German and U-boat pressure had become too severe, the Admiralty could have closed the Mediterranean at Gibraltar and at the Suez Canal, and, sacrificingour important interests in that area, proceeded to the relief of Singapore, or, ofcourse, a fortiori to the aid of Australia or New Zealand supposing either wasthe victim of a serious attack.4. Now, however, that Italy is neutral and may even become a friend,the British Fleet has become again entirely mobile. Only a very few capital ships are needed in the North Sea to contain the small German Fleet and supportthe blockade from Scotland to Greenland. All the rest are now ranging freelyabout the oceans, either on convoy work, or hunting raiders. Although it is notat present within our power to place a superior battle fleet in the Home waters of japan, it would be possible, if it were necessary, to place a squadron of battleshipsin the Far East sufficient to act as a major deterrent on Japanese actionso far from home, or to send capital ships to Australian or New Zealandwaters from the moment that the danger to either Singapore, Australia or new Zealand developed in a manner which made their protection a real and practical war need. The Admiralty accepts the full responsibility of defending Australia, New Zealand or Singapore from a Japanese attackon a large scale, and after containing the German heavy ships they haveforces at their disposal for these essential purposes. The chief difficulty would arise from the stringency in destroyer strength; but this situation should improve as our building programmes develop and as the U-boat is masteredby our attack. It is, however, wise to use every vessel we possess to the highest possible advantage in the fighting area, and only to move them to other waterswhen the War moves thither. The Admiralty a*re, therefore, most grateful forthe loyal and clairvoyant strategy which has to the uninstructed eye denudedAustralia and New Zealand of naval force. In particular, the assistance of theAustralian destroyers is of invaluable aid. But we wish to make it plain that we regard the defence of Australia and New Zealand, and of Singapore as astepping-stone to these two Dominions, as ranking next to the mastering of theprincipal fleet to which we are opposed, and that if the choice were presented of defending them against a serious attack, or sacrificing British interests in theMediterranean, our duty to our kith and kin would take precedence.It seems very unlikely, however, that this bleak choice will arise during thenext year or two, which is what we have to consider at the present time.5. Hitherto this note has dealt only with the gravest issues of a major attack upon Singapore or a serious invasion of Australia or New Zealand. However,the question has been raised of an encroachment by Japan upon the DutchColonies in the East Indies, probably arising out of a German invasion of holland, in which event it might be assumed that we should be involved in a stateof war with Japan. It seems very unlikely that the United States wouldimpassively watch the acquisition by Japan of Naval bases west and south-west of the Philippines. Such an act of Japanese aggression would seriouslycompromise the whole American position in the Pacific, and it cannot be doubtedthat Japan would weigh this consideration with the utmost care before committingherself, having regard especially to the fact that she is already deeply entangledin China. The contingency must, therefore, be regarded as highly improbable,unless,,of course, Great Britain and France are getting the worst of it, when manyevils will descend upon us all.However, should Japanese encroachment begin, or should Great Britain pass into a state of war with Japan, the Admiralty would make such preparation&apos;dispositions as would enable them to offer timely resistance either to the seriousattack upon Singapore or to the invasion of Australia and New Zealand. Thesedispositions would not necessarily take the form of stationing a fleet at
Singapore, but would be of a character to enable the necessary concentrations to:be made to the eastward in ample time to prevent a disaster.  With our presentlimited forces we cannot afford to have any important portion of H.M. Fleet idhvAll ships must play their part from day to day, and there are always the hazards.^of war to be faced, but the Admiralty can be trusted to make the appropriatedispositions to meet events as they emerge from imagination into reality.6. &apos; Finally, it must be pointed out that we are now at the lowest point of our strength compared to Germany and Japan. As our new battleships now being built come into service, the relative position should steadily improve.There are no naval grounds, therefore, always assuming that the UnitedStates is our friend, which should prevent the despatch of Australian andXew Zealand armies to the decisive battlefields, where their name stands so high.w. s. c.November 21, 1939.
