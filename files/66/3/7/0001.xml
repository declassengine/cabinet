[ &quot;Report by the Chiefs of Staff Comultteo.sThe War Cabinet   at the Meeting on 23rd October,asked us to consider with particular reference to TelegrauNo. 161, dated 21st October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s-Minister, Helsingfors, what are the relative advantages r-nddisadvantages which would accrue to us if, either formallyor inf ormally, we were to declare war on the U.-3.&amp;.R. ac theresult of Soviet aggression against Finland or against suy ofthe other Scandinavian countries.We would mention at the outset that any suchaggression would be a very formidable military enterprise,especially at this time of year;   and one on which Russia is unlikely to embark.LOCAL MILITARY IMPLICATIONS IN SCANDINAVIA.2.        Any effective Russian attack on Norway or Sweden must-involve an invasion of Finland as an essential preliminary,although sea-borne attack on a light scale, or air attack,would^-be feasible.    The invasion of Finland itself, however,would involve no military threat to the Allies.3.        If Russian aggression in this region were to continue,the next step would be an invasion of Svfeden.     This, ifdirected with the ultimate idea of occupying NARVIK, wo Idpass through the principal Scandinavian iron ore districtupon which Germany relies for her requirements.    A Russianinvasion into Sweden as far as the iron ore fields, or evendown to NARVIK in Norway, would not materially affect the tane-diate military situation between ourselves and Germany, but wesl W.M..(39)57th Conclusions, Minute 8*Annex.,     &apos;

could not be certain, that it would? stop there.    Any fus?the!pRussian penetration Into Norway, or the eBtahlishment ofRussian naval ana air oases in Norway on the lines of therecent soviet-Esthooisa &quot;agreement&quot;, would progressivelyincrease the ultimate threat to the security of the british isles..4.       Ws$ could afford naval support to Norway in the eventof a Russian sea-borne expedition against Narvik.    A landijjstpasion would be a long and  difficult operation for the-Russians.    A small British force, say a Brigade Group, based.on the Narvik-Boden railway and operating in support of the norwegians and Swedes, might have an effect out of all proportion to its size.     Although campaigning conditionsin Scandinavia would be extremely arduous, the despatch of asmall expedition would be a practicable proposition.    We rioul&amp;jhowever, afford no assistance to Finland against russian aggression,So       The German reaction to a Russian invasion of scandinavia would depend upon how far it seemed likely toprogress.    We cannot believe she would agree to Russiandomination of the Scandinavian States right down to theSkagerack, even if her present relations with Russia   are asgood as she pretends.     Even the occupation of the swedish iron ore fields would be   a matter of considerable concernunless she could trust Russia   absolutely.6.       We are unable to assess what Germany&apos;s attitude wouldbe to a Russian invasion of northern Scandinavia, but it mightwell provoke a German invasion in the south.    This combination,resulting in German-Soviet domination of the Scandinavianpeninsular, would constitute   a   serious threat to our interests which it would be to our advantage to resist.Nevertheless the question of whether we should fight Russiaeas well as Germany, cannot be determined   on the single issueof the Scandinavian States, since it involves far wider issues.

7. V7e have already examined some of the implications of Russian assistance to Germany (Paper Mo. C.O.S. (39) 69)and. the conclusions we then reached were as follows i-&quot;(a)   Russian propaganda, particularly in the KiddleEast, which is an inr-iediate menace to our&apos;interests would he intensified,   Urgentsteps should he taken to counter this.(b) German-Russian economic co-operation would slowup the effect of our economic pressure on germany, and she might feel, she could affor$to play a waiting game.(c) Russian intervention may have blocked the way InSouth-Eastern Europe to German penetration, &quot;butat the same time it protects to some extentGermany1s flank and rear.   In consequence theWest is more than ever the decisive front andis likely to be the scene of any immediateGerman offensive. - Direct Russian co-operation on the Western Front w-uld probably be limited in character.(d) It is by penetration into Iran, Iraq and afghanistan that Russia could cause us the mostserious embarrassment.   This combined with a hostile Italy would present a problem almostinsoluble with our present resources in theKiddle East.   Even with Italy neutral theposition would be most serious.   Only if italy were definitely friendly, could we afford to,denude the Middle East cf land and air forces inorder to reinforce the threatened area.(e) The danger of Japanese alliance with Germany has passed but the lapse of Russian interest in Gh^x^will tend to free the hands of Japan. &quot;..&apos;e cannotassess where the bal ance of advantage lies.    \&apos;(f) If Russia were openly hostile submarine warfarewould probably be intensified in home waters. &quot;*&apos;More determined action by German surface vesselswould have to be expeoted and the availability of the ice-frse port of Murmansk would broadenthe base of the ene.&apos;uy&apos;s operations.   A minor &apos;threat to British trade might develop in the^Pacific.(g) Partly because&apos; of the slowing up of our economic pressure, and partly in consequence of thedispersion of our strength in secondary theatresthe date When the Allies could pass to the offensive on land and in the air ^ould probablybe postponed.

(a) A partnership between Nazi Germany and BolshevikRussia must, however, be an uneasy one.   contact with the Russian Armies and the disquietingeffect of the Susso-German rapprochement will increase the chances of an internal break up inGermany, especially if she suffers ass? militaryreverses.&quot;8. An examination of these conclusions sho^s that (a),(b), (c), (e) and (g) are already operative although we arenot yet at war with Russia,9. In fact the main disadvantages of declaring war would be that we might soon have to face an attack by Russiaagainst Iran., Iraq and India and there would be someintensification of Haval attack upon our trade.10. One of the most important consequences which weshould have to assess would be the effect on Husso-german relations and upon the internal situation in Germany.   On theone hand, the fact that Russia jmd Germany were both at war with us might weld them together into a most formidablemilitary combination. On the other hand, if Hitler, who hasalwayB championed the Nordic races, should now agree to theBolshevisation of the Scandinavian States, the result mightwell cause grave misgivings in Germany.11. On the long view, however, there are certain additional factors of which we eight to take account in determining our attitude towards Russia.12. At present the sincerity of Prance and Great britain is being questioned, and force is being added to german propaganda, particularly in Italy and Spain, because we havenot declared war on Russia in spite of the fact that she hasalready interfered ^ith the liberty of small states in much the same way as Germany.   Moreover, most neutral states seemto regard the spread of Bolshevism as worse than Sitlerism,against which we have set our faces.   There is, therefore,

Some danger that, if we fail to stand up to Russia, we maylose the sympathy of neutral states to an extent whichmay have dangerous military implications.   Even Turkey,who is more anxious than ourselves to avoid hostilities with Russia, has already sho^vn that she is not prepared to sacrifice her liberty of action on this account.13. -       Moreover, it is not only Europe and the middle east that we have to consider.   In the Par East, Japan hasalready reacted strongly against a bargain between Germanyand Russia, and a firm attitude on our part towards russia might at least ensure   the sympathetic neutrality of Japan.The United States also have clearly shown that theirsympathy lies with Finland and the Scandinavian States.14. On the other hand the doubtful neutrals such asItaly and Japan, although apparently prepared to encourageus to stand against Russia on moral grounds, might hope thutthis would lead to our undertaking a military commitment which was beyond our strength and of which they could latertake advantage.CONCLUSIONS.15. The question thus seems to resolve itself intowhether any advantage which might accrue from the supportof neutrals, consequent upon a stand by us against russian aggression, will outweigh the disadvantage which we shouldincur by the undoubted increase in our military commitmentrand by the probability that we should weld Germany and russia more firmly together.16. The key of the neutral situation is the UnitedStates of America. There is no doubt that the open supportof the United States would decide the attitude of Japan andprobably that of Italy and Spain.   The resulting accretion

to our military strength would for. outweigh the additional commitments we should undertake in going to war with Russia.We are, however, not in a position to assess the possiblereaction of neutrals in general or of the United States inparticular.17. In our view we and Prance are at present in noposition to undertake additional burdens and we cannot,therefore, from a military point of view, recommend thatwe should declare war on Russia.   On the contrary we should endeavour to postpone the issue until we are stronger, andwe should try to avoid any action likely to consolidate the alliance between Germany and Rxissia.18. If; however, the War Cabinet decides that we must take a stand against Russian aggression in Scandinavia, then we feel that it is important to select the right moment to announce our intention.   This should be when it is clearbeyond doubt that Russia intends to invade Sweden or Norway.No assurance of support should be given to Finland alone, o.-to Sweden in connection with the threat to Finland,(Signed)   0.L.No NEWiajj.; EDMUND IRONSIDE.to.V.

Magog- L-Q-ITi-D SISTHIBtlTioa,-De cypher.   Mr. Snow (Helsingfors)2lst October, 1959.D.        10.7 p.m.      21st October, 19S9.H.        11.10 p.m.     21st October, 1939.Ho. 161.S S S X s immediate.Very Gonfidential. iKy telegram Ho. 15B.While the outcome of the Moscow negotiationscannot as yet be foresdenj His Majesty1 s Governments couriof action in the case of aggression on this country by russia is no doubt already receiving consideration.   i assume condonation of so cold blooded a crime to be outof the question on the part of protagonists in theidealist war against aggression and that,, in view of earlier Soviet treachery, a complete breach with theSoviet Government would command nation-wide support,while condonation would not only involve our professionsin complete discredit in Scandinavia and elsewhere butalso at home and in our own hearts as well.    I put thispoint first, but the question also arises what groundthere is to believe that a Soviet attack on Finland wouldstop there or that the Russians will not instal themsolveion the Norwegian seaboard and menace us permanently from there.2.        On these grounds I assume that the choice before his Majesty&apos;s Government, in the case of the iniquitouscrime in question, will present itself as a choice betweeibreach of diplomatic relations with Russia or declarationof war.3.        In the latter connection I venture to suggest(a) that Stalin is a more likely winner than Herr hitler and, if left to his own devices, is accordingly possibly the greater menace of the two, (b) that, in view of trcpotential danger of Soviet-German predominance in scandinavia (and also of the risks of Soviet actionelsewhere) and policy which would damage the Soviet merethan ourselves would be preferable to 2? form o ? negativepolicy of breaking off relations.4.        If this be granted, the question arises how theSoviet could be damaged and I venture accordingly tosuggest the extreme desirability of giving ear and themost unprejudiced consideration possible to the con-elusion of an arrangement with Japan.     Japan, rhiehwould be in a position to deal Russia&apos;s criminal policy a sickening blow, is animated by a deep-seated hostility to Bolshevism and temporary suspicion of Germany andalso long-felt sympathy with Poland as the Soviet&apos;sneighbour on the other side.    At the same time theprospect of securing Viadivostoic, Amur and the maritimeprovinces of Saghalin and leased fisheries appealprofoundly to Japanese aspirations.

5. President of United States of America having authorised representations at Moscow on behalf of Finland and given Soviet warning against aggression, Anglo-Japanese action against Soviet in case aggression in Scandinavia would be in line with United States policy, and I assume if and when Soviet commit aggression on Scandinavia, Japanese aggression on Soviet would not be considered improper.

6. While I fully realise the weight of departmental precedents against entertaining proposal here put forward, it should perhaps be recalled:

(a) that last Anglo-Japanese alliance brought nothing but benefit to both countries; and particularly Japan&apos;s success in its last war with Russia brought benefit:

(b) that Manchuria, presumably North China as well, would long since been Russian if Japan had not risked its own existence in excluding Russia in 1905.

7. Military and Naval aspects of proposal are naturally out of my view but I venture to suggest Hitler and Stalin might not be necessarily more dangerous in closer association. The latter may be what each most dreads and nearer association might only intensify friction. Against the risks of Soviet air and submarine operations must presumably be weighed advantage, in eventuality supposed, of denying Norwegian coast to Soviet air and submarine fleets, of denying Scandinavian resources including Swedish iron ore to Germany; and finally advantage of securing Japanese co-operation which besides military effects would no doubt powerfully assist process by which German and Russian peoples will be only day weary of their leaders.

In view of confidential nature I have desisted from repeating my telegram (sic).
