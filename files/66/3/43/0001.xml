(39) 126), I think it may be useful for mycolleagues to see the attached historical summary of the treatment of this question with the Norwegian Government in 1918.H.Foreign Office, November 28, 1939.LAYING OF MINES IN NORWEGIAN TERRITORIAL WATERSIN 1918.ON the 7th August, 1918, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Christiania, acting on instructions, handed to the Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs a secret memorandum in the following sense :-In order to prevent attacks by German submarines on both Allied and neutral shipping, the Allies had constructed a minefield barrage betweenGreat Britain and Norwegian territorial waters. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment confidently relied upon the Norwegian Government preventing, inaccordance with a Norwegian Royal resolution of the 30th January, 1917,the use by German submarines of Norwegian territorial waters in order toobtain access to the open sea. His Majesty&apos;s Government possessed ampleevidence that German submarines were, in fact, so violating norwegian territorial waters, and therefore considered themselves obliged to invite theNorwegian Government to enforce their own decree impartially against allbelligerents. In their view, the only means by which this could be doneeffectually was for Norway to mine her territorial waters to the eastwards ofthe Allied minefield, precedents being quoted of the action of Sweden in mining the Kogrund Channel and of Denmark in mining the passage betweenSaltholm and Amager. Refusal by Norway to comply with this requestwould be equivalent to discrimination in favour of Germany and againstthe Allies, and would permit German submarines to violate with impunityregulations adopted by Norway in order to preserve her own neutrality andwould facilitate the illegal destruction; of Norwegian shipping.   His10728   [20392]
Majesty&apos;s Government therefore confidently expected that the norwegian government would either place the necessary minefields or permit the allies to do so. His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer the former alternative,and the measure should be carried out without loss of time.2. In conversation with Sir M. Findlay, the Minister for Foreign affairs agreed that any action which might be taken should be taken by Norway on her own initiative and without any appearance of being adopted at the suggestion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and he undertook to consult his Government andthe Norwegian Admiral at once. Sir M. Findlay was supported in his repre-sentations by his Allied colleagues (although the United States Minister did notrefer to mining as the only effective method), and he continued to press theNorwegian Government for an early decision. On the 12th August theNorwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs handed to Sir M. Findlay a memo-randum giving the reply of the Norwegian Government. This expressed concernat the British reports of German violations of the Norwegian Resolution of the30th January, 1917, as this had not been established by the reports in the possession of the Norwegian naval authorities; they proposed, however, to take immediate steps to render still more effective their supervision of norwegian territorial waters and had contemplated requesting an explanation from theGerman Government, but had felt precluded from taking such action in view ofthe confidential nature of the British communication; as regards the proposal that the Norwegian Government should mine their territorial waters, however,the memorandum proceeded as follows : &apos;&apos; The obligations based on International Law which War imposes upona neutral State with reference to its territorial waters consist partly in thatit shall prevent by the means at its disposal any of the belligerents fromutilising them for warlike operations or as a base for such operations, andpartly in that it must enforce the regulations issued by it impartiallytowards all the belligerents. Beyond what accrues from these obligationsnone of the belligerents is justified under International Law in requiring theadoption of special measures by the neutral State within its own territorial waters. In both respects the Norwegian Government are conscious of havingunhesitatingly fulfilled their obligations. As their efforts from the beginningof the war have been directed towards the maintenance of an inviolableneutrality, so it is also tfleir firm intention to uphold it in the future andto avoid every step whic$ may be regarded as a deviation from this attitude.&quot; The above-mentioned Norwegian resolution of the 30th January. 1917,regarding the passage of submarines through and their tarrying in terri-torial waters is framed solely out of regard for Norwegian interests. It isof course not its intention to facilitate the belligerent operations of either the one or the other belligerent. Nor does it impose upon Norway any obligation under International Law other than that of enforcing theresolution impartially towards all parties which, as already stated, theNorwegian Government are conscious of having done. It cannot give to any state the right to require special measures to secure its observance.&quot;The memorandum went on to say that if it were established that german submarines were passing through Norwegian territorial waters, the norwegian government would at once consider what measures were called for in their own interests. In their opinion the negotiations at the Second Hague PeaceConference preceding the acceptance of Article 4 of Convention No. VIII did not show that it was possible to rely upon any general recognition of the right of a neutral State to lay mines when the defence of the country itself against attack was not in question, and this consideration would be all the greater if the laying of mines was undertaken as the result of representations by one belligerent party;and it was quite clear that a breach of neutrality would occur should Norwaypermit one of the belligerents to lay the mines. Apart from questions ofinternational law, the laying of mines as proposed would have a restrictive effecton Norwegian shipping.3. Although the Norwegian Government were not prepared to comply withthe Allied request, they expressed readiness to take other measures to increasethe efficiency of their watch on their territorial waters.   The question was
considered by the War Cabinet on the 16th August, when the First Sea Lordexpressed the view that the proposed Norwegian measures were quite inadequate for the purpose of preventing submarines passing the eastern end of the north sea barrage. The view was taken that it was necessary to impress on theNorwegian Government that the mining of their territorial waters was the only effective method, but it was recognised that the situation was delicate and difficult, and that it would be undesirable to present an ultimatum insisting that unless the work were carried out by a definite date it would be undertaken byHis Majesty&apos;s Government; it was also realised that Norway, by closing the gap, might lay herself open to a declaration of war by Germany, in which casesome measure of assistance would have to be given to Norway.&apos; As a result ofthis discussion. His Majesty&apos;s Minister, on the 19th August, handed to theNorwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs a secret memorandum regretting thatthe Norwegian reply could not be regarded as otherwise than unsatisfactory;details were given of German violations of Norwegian waters and the norwegian government were requested to take steps effectually to enforce their own regula-tions; otherwise the immunity given to German submarines at a critical point oftheir passage would be regarded almost as amounting to an unfriendly act asaffording assistance to one belligerent at the expense of the other. Thememorandum expressed the view that the Norwegian Governments own proposals were inadequate for the purpose, stated that mining was the only effective method and pointed out that the right of neutrals to mine their territorial waters was clearly admitted by Article 4 of Hague Convention No. XVIII, which had beenadopted unanimously; the Allied Governments did not wish, however, to givethe Norwegian Government reason to feel that they were being treated harshlyor inconsiderately, so His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to postponeany action for a short period in the confident expectation that the norwegian government would themselves become convinced that the passage of. submarinescould not be prevented by any amount of patrolling.4. In handing this memorandum to the Minister for Foreign Affairs,Sir M. Findlay expressed his personal conviction that, should Norwegian vessels on patrol fire on German submarines, Norway would be taking much greaterrisks of war than by laying mines to bar the waters in question against allbelligerents, and. taking advantage of this aspect of the question, gave an indication of the measure of assistance which His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe prepared to give to Norway in the event of her being involved in war withGermany. The representations of His Majesty&apos;s Government were supported bythe other Allied Governments, and care was taken by all to avoid threateninglanguage to the Norwegian Government.5. On the 30th August, the Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs handed to Sir M. Findlay a copy of a telegram addressed to the Norwegian repre-sentatives at belligerent capitals instructing them to inform the respective governments that a submarine had been observed in Norwegian territorial watersoff Karmoen, that the Norwegian Government regarded such infractions of theirregulations with increasing anxiety and must warn belligerents that they hadalready increased their supervision of the waters in question and would be obliged, in order to protect their rights, to adopt &quot; special military measures.&quot;Sir M. Findlay expressed the hope that this meant that the Norwegian authorities were now prepared to lay mines. In reporting this conversation, he expressedthe opinion that the attitude of the Norwegian Government appeared to bestiffening, but doubted whether they would dare to act as desired unless germany were to suffer some decisive disaster they appeared to be deterred only by fearof Germany, and this fear was decreasing.6. On the 20th September Sir M. Findlay was able to report the receipt of confidential information that the Norwegian&quot; Government had decided to laymines, this being due chiefly to a report from the Norwegian Minister at Berlin,who had hitherto opposed the measure, to the effect that it could now be donesafely. Sir M. Findlay expressed the opinion that this change of opinion mightbe due to the increasing weakness of Germany as a result of military reversesand internal troubles, and he had no doubt that the Allied military successes had had a great influence on the attitude of the Norwegian Government.
7. On the 28th September the Norwegian Government addressed messages to the belligerent Governments reporting that they had found it necessary to laymines in certain parts of Norwegian territorial waters because &quot; the anxiety ofthe Norwegian Government has been augmented, as they have not been able to close their eyes to the risk existing that the many instances which have been ascertained beyond doubt may not at any time be followed by further instances of violation.&quot; (It is worthy of note that the communication addressed to HisMajesty&apos;s Government protested specifically against an (admitted) violation of norwegian territorial waters by a British submarine, thus emphasising theimpartial nature of the Norwegian Governments action.) On the same day anotification was published giving the position of the minefield and closing the waters concerned for general traffic as from the 7th October.8. Having taken the decision, the Norwegian Government still considered it necessary to discuss the question from the point of international law. In amemorandum handed to His Majesty&apos;s Minister on the 28th September it was stated that Hague Convention No. XIII laid down definitely in Article 10 thatthe neutrality of a country could not be compromised merely by the fact thatbelligerent warships were permitted passage through its territorial waters, andthat this made no exception in regard to submarines; the fact that Norway, bymeans of a municipal regulation, had conditionally forbidden such war vessels topass through her territorial waters did not in any way affect her internationalposition and did not give the belligerents any right to make demands upon herwhich were not based upon general international Taw; the Norwegian regulationwas called for exclusively in Norway&apos;s own interests, and, inasmuch as a similarmeasure had not been adopted by all of the other neutral States, Norway wouldbe fully justified in international law in cancelling the regulation if the circum-stances at any given moment were no longer such as to render it in&apos; accordancewith her own interests.9. His Majesty&apos;s Government, having secured their object, did notthereafter continue the discussion of the theoretical aspect of the question.Foreign Office, November 27, 1939.
