This memorandum has been drawn up on the basis that we shouldaugment the British Army in France to the maximum extent possible in the shortest possible time. In considering what may be practicable it is necessary tohave regard .to the equipment which is, or is likely to be, available not only forthe troops already in France and for those that may be sent out in the next fewmonths, but also for the essential requirements of A.D.G.B., Home defence and Training Units at home, and for the Middle East and garrisons abroad, etc.2. After careful consideration of the equipment position I have taken asthe immediate &quot; target&quot; the increase of our force in France to a strength of10 Divisions by the end of February, and I set out hereunder, firstly, thepremises as regards rate of despatch, composition of the Force, scales of reserves and equipment, etc.; secondly, a statement of the more important items wherethe equipment or maintenance position is below the standard hitherto laid down,and an indication of the probable extent of the deficiency; thirdly, some generalremarks on the situation.3. It is assumed that:  (a) the rate of despatch from the United Kingdom will be as follows:  1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions: in France already.5th Division: forming in France now, and ready by 15th December, 1939.48th Division: to be despatched from the United Kingdom on 1st January,1940.51st, 52nd, 44th and 50th Divisions: despatch from the United Kingdom to start on 15th January, 1940.)(b) the expenditure of ammunition and wastage of equipment due too operations commenced, on the scales laid down, for the first four divisions on15th November, 1939, and that it will commence for subsequent formationsaccording to their dates of arrival.(c) the process of building up A.D.G.B. will continue.(d) one cavalry division will proceed to Egypt in December. No further increases of equipment held by garrisons overseas will be made.(e) a minimum scale of training equipment will be provided for troops inthe United Kingdom and for Dominion Contingents expected in the Middle East.if) the scale of reserves in France is 6 weeks&apos; wastage for ammunition and3 nronths&apos; for equipment, except in the case of tanks, for which 6 weeks is allowed,ancTrespirators where extra reserves are allowed for to cover the risk of gasattack. ,(g) the forecasts of deliveries issued by the Ministry of Supply are fulfilledand no deliveries are allotted elsewhere than to the ten divisions, except tomeet (c), (d) and (e) above. -4. A detailed statement is attached (Appendix A) which shows the position^ICIexcifs 0^ ^e var*ous Divisions in regard to the more important items of equipment upt&apos;Equip. to Ist March, 1940. At the foot of that statement the requirements for mainten-pN&apos;T. ance are shown in relation to the further deliveries likely to be corning forwardbetween January and June, 1940.
: &apos;hv        -;V2.-:&apos;-&apos;-;:--Pv7.-v:: fyy.- ; -VV&apos; &quot;      &apos;:.v-&apos;-&apos;5. The calculations that have been made on the premises stated abovebring out clearly certain shortages in equipment The more important of these&quot;shortages are described below so that the degree of risk involved in the fulfilment of the programme, or the extent to which the equipment available falls below the standards which have been set in the past, can be readily seen.6. Breit Guns. After taking credit for estimated deliveries, and allowing for further commitments more tully referred to in paragraph 21 below, therewill be a shortage of 2,400 guns by March. Because of this it will be necessaryto allow for a reduction in the reserves to slightly below 50 per cent, and for replacement of only 50 per cent, of the scale of wastage, and to reduce the initial equipment of the 2nd Contingent to 75 per cent The shortage, however,can be made good progressively after March since deliveries exceed the full rateof wastage by 924 guns per month.7. Anti-Tank Rifles and Ammunition. The equipment, reserve and main-tenance position for the first six divisions is fully covered, though the position for the last lour divisions is not so satisfactory.The ammunition position, however, for these rifles is that approximately50 per cent, of the requirements of the ten divisions can be met up to the1st February, 1940, and thereafter only about a third of the monthly wastage.8. Small Arms Ammunition. Owing to the stocks of ammunition built up inpeace, there is no shortage until the first ten divisions are fully operating. Theproduction immediately in sight is not sufficient to meet the demands of the three services which have very largely increased since the outbreak of war. allocation of that production is still under consideration, but it is clear that, even if theI Anny received 75 per cent., the quantity available to the Army for some months after March will still be considerably short of their wastage requirements.9. Respirators. The requirements for equipment, normal reserve andwastage are fully covered, but there is a shortage in regard to the very largedecontamination reserve designed to provide against intense and continuousgas attack.10. Wheeled Vehicles. On the basis of requirements for mobile warfarethere is a considerable shortage in certain types of these vehicles, particularlyin the reserve position.11. $-inch and 2-inch Mortars and Ammunition. The supply of 3-inchMortars is adequate, but the ammunition situation is not yet &quot;satisfactory,particularly in regard to wastage for some period after February, .1940.   Thej supply of 2-inch Mortars is also adequate, but the ammunition shortage is likeiyI to be acute in the initial stages.12. 25-mm. Anti-Tank Gun. (A French gun held as an infantry anti-tank! weapon.^--The equipment position for the first six divisions is covered. NoneI of these weapons are at present available for the last four divisions. these weapons are not manufactured at all in the United Kingdom, and we entirelydepend on the French both for making good the equipment position, and for providing maintenance requirements. If there is difficulty or delay in obtainingfurther supplies from France, there will be a serious shortage, which of courselias to be considered in relation to the British anti-tank gun. (See paragraph 16below.)13. Field Guns and Ammunition. Since it has been impossible to meet our requirements of the 18/25-pdr. conversion and the new 25-pdr. weapon, theshortage has been made up to a considerable extent by the use of i8-pdr. gunsand 4&apos;5-inch howitzers, but it cannot entirely be made good. There will be an initial shortage in ammunition which can be measured by the fact that reserveswill be reduced to one third and the rate of fire to approximately two thirds ofthe wastage rates laid down.14. Medium Artillery and Ammunition. Since the new 5-5-inch howitzeris not yet ready, medium artillery consists of 60-pdr. guns and 6-inch howitzers.There is a slight shortage in pieces, but there is a serious shortage in 6-inch
howitzer ammunition, which is likely to persist until new capacity comes into production. The effect of this shortage will be a rationing in the rate of fir^pf6-inch howitzers to approximately one third of the wastage rate laid down.0 &apos;15. Heavy and Super-Heavy Artillery Ammunition. There will have to besevere rationing of expenditure of ammunition since supplies are sufficient onlyto meet a fraction of the rate of wastage.16. Anti-Tank Guns (Artillery Weapons). On approved establishmentsthere should be thirteen anti-tank regiments supporting ten divisions, but it willnot be possible to equip more than seven by March, and it will be some months before the additional regiments can be equipped after providing for reserves and wastage of the regiments already operating.17. Heavy Anti-Aircraft Guns. Out of 118 3-inch and 245 3-7-inch anti-aircraft guns (the latter required for the protection of base areas) there areavailable 120 3-inch and 55 3&quot;7-inch anti-aircraft guns after allocation has beenmade to A.D.G.B. and allowance for other commitments referred to in paragraph21 below.18. Light Anti-Aircraft Guns. The demand for this weapon for the field force is of very recent origin and it will not be possible to provide by March for more than 30 per cent, of the approved requirements for equipment, reserves and maintenance after allocation to A.D.G.B. It will be remembered that untilthe war the whole of this production came from abroad.IQ. Tanks. On approved establishments there should be&apos; two brigades (300tanks) of infantry tanks supporting ten divisions. It has only been possible tosend one battalion (50 tanks) with the first four divisions, and, if there is wastage,it will not be possible to send a further battalion before March. There is no possibility of sending out the 1st Armoured Division before March and probably not for some months thereafter.20. No attempt has been made in this paper to indicate the varying degrees of importance to be attached to the items where deficiencies exist it will beobvious that some are more important than others and the C.I.G.S. will be able toinform the War Cabinet of the military view as to this. It should be noted thatthe position described in this paper assumes full rates of wastage as from15th November, or the dates of arrival of the respective divisions in the line. Tothe extent that the commencement of active operations is delayed the position willbe correspondingly better. On the other hand, it will be realised that beforeadditional divisions beyond the first fpnr can be sent overseas such shortages asexist will have to be made good and further stocks of equipment accumulated.21. In this connection it may be appropriate to remind the Cabinet that thecalls other than those of the Field Force on the available equipment have been and are considerable.  Three examples may be given : Bren Guns. Some 18,000 have been delivered. Of these between 5,000 and,000 are now in France, nearly 7,000 are at present in this country, 2,900 have beensent to Ports Abroad including the Middle East Garrison, and just over 2,000have been sent to other customers, including Egypt, Palestine, etc. There are inaddition unfulfilled orders for 12,400 from other customers, the chief of which areIndia 6,100, Egypt 2,200 and South Africa 1,500.S.A.A. Apart from the requirements of the other Services, there are orders from Egypt, Turkey, New Zealand, African Colonies, Irak, Australia and Eiretotalling some 200,000,000 rounds, of which only a small proportion has been supplied.Heavy A.A. guns. Orders have been received from other customers notably Turkey, South Africa, Egypt, Portugal and India for 623 guns of thesetypes.   Of these over 100 have been supplied or are awaiting shipment.Although these calls may not represent firm promises; there are strong reasonsfor fulfilling such commitments, and it is likely that demands from our Allies andfriends will tend to increase.
,, Everything, therefore, points to the urgent necessity to do all in ourlo increase the supplies from home production and from abroad ofI-important items of equipment referred to in this paper, but I am advisedlHy little improvement in the position as regards major items can belid by the Spring of 1940.1 should add that the particulars as to the supply position have beenedin conference with the Minister of Supply.ij.
