I understandthat the War Office and the India Office are in general agreement with theconclusions of the memorandum.H.December 6, 1939.THE SOVIET THREAT TO BRITISH INTERESTS IN THEMIDDLE EAST.FROM being a comparatively remote possibility, the danger of Sovietexpansion in the Middle East has in the past weeks become a threat which it isno longer possible to ignore. The appearance of this new factor in the inter-national situation is not the consequence of any fundamental change in thecharacter of the Soviet State, or indeed in Soviet policy, but results from thelogical continuation of that policy in altered international circumstances.2. With the conclusion of the Soviet-German Treaty and the outbreak ofhostilities between Germany and the Allies, the German threat to the soviet union, for so long the dominant factor in Soviet policy, has, to a great extent,become neutralised. Likewise, the danger of a clash with Great Britain, which for close on a century has alone set bounds to&apos;Russian expansion in the middle east, has been diminished, if not entirely removed, by the prospect of a long warnecessitating the concentration of all available British resources in the west. Inthe circumstances it would only be logical for the Kremlin to give free rein to theexpansionist tendencies inherent in the character of the Soviet State in a regiontraditionally the goal of Russian ambitions, and offering considerable advantages in return for comparatively little effort. Such a move, moreover, would clearlyenjoy the full support of Germany.3.   It seems likely that, were such a course decided upon, Soviet expansionwould, in the first instance, be directed against Iran and Afghanistan, and that10748   [20439]
an attempt would be made to bring, at any rate, part of the territory of these;States under Soviet domination by means either of military penetration, by the mixed process of military and economic pressure and political intrigue, which has proved so successful in Sinkiang, or, simpler still, by the newly evolved &quot; Baltic &quot;method. An examination of this problem in collaboration with the War Office, theresults of which are recorded elsewhere, has shown that, from a military point ofview, the task would present comparatively few difficulties, while the internalstructure of the States concerned would make them easy victims,of intrigue andof the Soviet propaganda weapon, and probably render a thorough-going militarycampaign unnecessary. Although the Red army would almost certainly be nomatch for the armed forces of a great European Power, experience has shown thatit is quite capable of occupying territory where no real resistance is encounteredor of dealing with an enemy unprovided with modern means of defence.4. It does not seem probable that, in present circumstances, a Soviet landattack on India or Iraq need be feared, in view of the excessive strain which suchan effort would be likely to place on the Soviet military, economic and politicalmachine. Soviet penetration into Afghanistan or Iran, however, would constitute a definite advance in this direction and, whatever form it might take and whatevermethods might be employed, it would deal a grave blow to British prestige, andwould be likely to nave serious repercussions throughout the Middle East.Furthermore, it might eventually lead to an air attack on India or Iraq.5. If our resources permitted, it would, of course, be desirable to answerthis threat by direct military action. British armed forces, acting ostensibly in defence of the countries concerned and in conjunction with their troops, couldadvance as far into Iran or Afghanistan as was required by strategic considera-tions, and direct action might even be taken against Trans-Caucasia, if Turkishsupport were forthcoming. It seems probable, however, that, so long as GreatBritain is fully engaged m the West, it would be difficult, if not impossible, tomake available the necessary resources, and that any military counter-measures taken would have to be almost entirely defensive in character and limited toholding the frontiers of India and Iraq and possibly certain adjacent positions of vital strategic importance on Afghan or Iranian territory. Apart from theseminor defensive measures, our hopes of checking a Soviet advance would dependalmost entirely upon indirect methods, including propaganda.6. As regards these, so long as the situation in the Middle East remainsstable, any attempt at subversive activities inside the Soviet Union is both uncalledfor and impracticable; indeed, in present conditions, even the organisation of asatisfactory intelligence system is likely to prove extremely difficult. If, however,the Soviet Government were to adopt a forward policy in the Middle East and to advance on one pretext or another beyond their own frontiers, the situation wouldundergo a radical change and many of the present difficulties would automaticallydisappear. In the first place, the movement of troops, the occupation of foreignterritory and the ensuing confusion in the frontier districts would render the frontiers of the Soviet Union less impenetrable than is at present the case.Furthermore, any territorial annexations would mean the inclusion of foreign and potentially unstable elements in the population of the Soviet Union, which has for the past twenty years been carefully preserved from any contact with the outerworld. These factors could not fail to produce an unsettling effect on theinhabitants of the neighbouring Soviet provinces, and a review of the presentsituation in Soviet Central Asia and Trans-Caucasia, based on recent first-handobservation, leads to the conclusion that, while the difficulty of initiating arevolutionary movement would. be considerable, once this difficulty had been overcome, the possibilities of turmoil in these regions would be very great.7. In order to be able to take full advantage of a situation offering, at anyrate, some possibilities of embarrassing the Soviet invader, it would be necessarythat we should, if and when the occasion arose, have at our disposal an organisa-tipn capable of, operating on territory threatened with invasion, on territoryactually under Soviet control, and finally in any adjacent regions of the soviet union which might in the circumstances have become accessible. The aims ofsuch an organisation would be, briefly, to stiffen the resistance of the national forces and population against Soviet encroachment or invasion in territory ofwhich the subjugation had not been completed, to promote rebellion against
Soviet rule, and if possible guerrilla warfare, in occupied territory, and, finally,to establish contact with disaffected elements in the Soviet Union itself and raisethe standard of revolt in as large an area of Soviet territory as possible. In SovietCentral Asia and Trans-Caucasia appeal would have to be made to such religiousfeelings as still exist amongst the population, to any nationalist or any anti-Russian feelings they may have, and to the bitter hatred which the present regimeis bound to have engendered in many classes of the population.8. As a preparation for such an eventuality the organization of an effective /intelligence system in the regions in question is the first essential. So far as india and Afghanistan are concerned, action is already being taken by theexisting Indian intelligence authorities to improve their sources of information about Central Asia, and the Afghan Prime Minister has promised his personalco-operation. Similarly, in Iraq and Iran attention is being given to the questionof improving intelligence in consultation with the Middle East IntelligenceCentre. It is suggested that, in collaboration with the existing intelligencesystems, the necessary steps should now be taken for preparing an organizationof the kind contemplated in paragraph 7, and, if possible, for establishingprovisional contact with disaffected elements inside the Soviet Union. Themethods by which the necessary agents would be recruited and cadres formed are discussed in detail in a Foreign Office memorandum of which copies have beensent to the Departments concerned.9.. Various considerations would seem to render India and Iraq the mostsuitable control centres, while the nature of the scheme makes it inevitable thatit should come under the heading of Military Intelligence, although clearly close co-operation between all the Departments concerned would be necessary. above all, it would seem essential that those responsible for its execution should includenot only experts in Persian and Afghan matters, but also officers or officials withrecent first-hand experience of the Soviet Union, and, in particular, of SovietCentral Asia and the Caucasus. The Soviet Union is not altogether a normalcountry, and, in endeavouring to determine the likely reactions of the soviet authorities and population in any given circumstances, or in estimating the valueof information received, the importance of first-hand experience cannot beoverrated.10. It is to be hoped that, in spite of the strong temptation for the SovietGovernment to take advantage of so promising a situation, the dictates ofprudence and, in particular, fear of British reactions, may prevail with Stalinand cause him to refrain from embarking on any venture of the kind indicatedin this memorandum. The existence, however, at the present time of anundeniable threat to British Imperial interests renders it imperative to ensurethat, in the event of this threat materialising, it will not find us altogetherunprepared.11. For the present little more than purely preparatory measures could betaken; but it is evident that the elaboration of a*scheme such as that contem-plated, and, in particular, the formation of the necessary cadres, would requiretime, and uncertainty as to Soviet intentions makes it essential the preparations should be begun without delay. It is accordingly suggested that the Departmentsconcerned should be given authority to take the necessary action forthwith.Foreign Office, December 6, 1939.
