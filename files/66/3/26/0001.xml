THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC EJflJESTY&apos;S G0YERSI2.IEBTSECRET.W.P. (39) 12&amp;WAR CABINET.THE NORTHERN BARRAGE.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.AFTER much consideration I commend this project to my colleagues.There is no doubt that, as it is completed, it will impose a very greatdeterrent upon the exits and returns of TJ-Boats and surface raiders. Itappears to be a prudent provision against an intensification of the U-Boatwarfare, and an insurance against the danger of Russia joining our enemy.By this we coop the lot in, and have complete control of all approaches aliketo the Baltic and the North Sea. The essence of this offensive minefield isthat the enemy will be prevented by the constant vigilance of superior naval force from sweeping channels through it. &quot;When it is in existence we shallfeel much freer in the outer seas than we do at present. Its gradual butremorseless growth, which will be known to the enemy, will exercise adepressive effect upon his morale. The cost is deplorably heavy, but a largeprovision has already been made by the Treasury, and the Northern BarrageJS far the best method of employing this means of war.Although a further provision of ten ships for mine-carrying and mine-laying is needed, and this is a very heavy drain upon our straitened shipping resources, we ought to get this tonnage back many times over in the coarseof the first year that the barrage-is in working order.W.

Printed far Ike War Cabinet. Noeem&amp;er 18SS.secret.P. (39) tSB.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care ma; be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE NORTHERN BARRAGE.AT the present time, almost the whole of the British Fleet is on the defensive, in order that the essential flow of trade may be maintained. In spiteof the fact that this Country, allied to France, is at war with Germany only, thenumber of ships in service of all kinds, with the exception of Capital Ships, is insufficient. The defensive dispositions which have been adopted are due to thenecessity of dealing with (ef Raiders, (6) U-boats, (c) Air attack and (d) Mines.2. Though the number of German men-of-war suitable for operations on thetrade routes is small, they may he sent out one at a time over a long period. Inaddition, Germany possesses a very considerable number of merchant shipssuitable for conversion for raider operations. These may also endeavour to breakout of the North Sea at irregular intervals. Hence, there is no certainty that therewill be any release from the defensive dispositions covering the trade routes.3.  If the number of U-boats operating does not materially increase, it ishoped that they may he defeated by: (a) Perfection of the convoy system.(6) Continuous escort of convoys throughout their passage.(c) Arming of all ships.(&apos;/) Increasing the number of hunting vessels.4. There is every Indication, however, that the output of U-boats will belai-geiv increased, and information has been received that the Germans are endeavouring to purchase Russian and Italian submarines. It is also possible thatthe development of new U-boat tactics, or a large increase in range of action,would require still further defensive measures. As ksig as the U-boats are ableto reach the Empire^ trade routes, tier will continue to cause some kisses and willhe a SOUree of rwntinnal awniHy-Air Attack.-5. Air attack an trade has not yet proved to be sarious, and aircraft, whichhave attempted to attack merchant ships in convoy o2 the East Coast, have been driven off before inflicting damage.Readers.U-boats.[20298]
Mines. :6. The Germans are known tc have very large stocks of mines, and at anytime the menace from mines may assume serious proportions.Cumulative effect of these forms of attack.7. The cumulative effect of Raider, TJ-boat, air attacks and stines may bevery considerable. If air attack on trade proves to be really serious, it will be essential to eliminate as far as possible all other causes of loss. As long asRaiders, U-boats and U-boat Minelayers can break out of the North Sea, shippingmay be subjected to these forms of attack everywhere. Bat if they can be prevented from leaving the North Sea, the raider menace will be eliminated andthe U-boat and Mine menaces will be jestricted to the North Sea.The only means of doing this is to lay a Northern MinsBasrage.Additional Reasons for laying a Northern Barrage.8.  A mine barrage would be of great value: (a) To assist in Contraband Control in the North Sea Ana;(6) To provide protection for Scandinavian convoys;(c) To reduce the chance of loss of Capital Ships by attritkzi, throughU-boat action.Contraband Control in the North Sea.9. Owing to weather conditions in Northern latitudes, particularly in winter, it is necessary to employ Armed Merchant Cruisers for interceptingshipping. In the course of their duties, these large and valuable ships have to stop for boarding purposes. If the Germans abandoned submarine attack on trade for a month and concentrated on attacking ships of the Northern PatroLthere is no doubt that they could cause such heavy losses in Armed merchant cruisers as to force the patrol to be abandoned. Were this to happen, there &quot;wouldbe no restriction of trade and the relentless pressure of sea power oa germany would largely cease.The Scandinavian Convoys.10. Unless a large part of the Home Fleet is used to provide cover for the scandinavian convoys, there is every chance that regrettable incidents will occur.There were two occasions in the Great &quot;War when serious ksses resulted from attack by superior forces. Had the Germans been more enterprising, there wouldhave been many more.If Capital Ships are used as cover for this convoy route, they will providegood opportunities for attack by U-Boats. Once the Northern Barrage becomeseffective, however, the protection of these convoys will be greatly facilitated.The Northern Mine Barrage.11. To achieve the object in view, the shortest practical barrage would hein the area between the Orkneys and the Norwegian coast. This position hasthe following advantages: (A) It is sufficient distance from enemy bases-(i) To render minesweeping impracticable, except as part of a majoroperation supported by a Fleet.(ii) To make air attack, on a scale sufficient to present miuelayingoperations at night, unlikely.(B) It is close to the main Fleet bases, and this wiB fadlitafce sbe nrosisksof cover for the laying operations.(C) It will not seriously &quot;interfere -with the operations of the Main Fleet ordetacned forces in the North Sea.(D) It covers the entrances to the Baltic as well as the German North Seaports.
12.  The&apos; disadvantages: (A) The Pentland Firth is uncovered. This, however, owing to the strongtides, is unsuitable for navigation by submarines when submergeuL.(B) The Eastern end rests in neutral territorial waters. The mine barragecould not be made really effective unless the Norwegians can be induced to lay mines to extend the barrage through their territorial waters to the coast, as was done in the last war.The Northern, Barrage laid in the Great War.13. Laying operations started on the 8th June, 1918, in the centre and eastern sections. By the end of the month approximately 7.000 mines had been laid. In July approximately 17.000 were laid, in August 13,000, September18.500. and October 15.000, the barrage being completed on the 26th October, 1918,when approximately 70,500 mines had been laid.Results obtained.14. Xo mines were laid in the area next to the Orkneys until the7th September, yet two days later it is recorded that U-92 and U-102 were destroyed in this area. These were the first known casualties. On the25th September it is claimed that three submarines were destroyed. Finally, aU-boat was mined in the Barrage on the 19th October, making a total estimated as six in just under six weeks. It is believed that three more German submarines were damaged by this mine-field but managed to reach port. This was probably due to the fact that many of the American antennae mines laid in the early stageswere set to explode outside &quot; killing &quot; range.Number of mines required for proposed Barrage.15. In any future barrage in a similar position, it is estimated that fourlines of mines at each of seven depths would be necessary, in order to extend the barrage down to a depth of 300 feet.   This would require 36,000 large andRate of Manufacture.16. A rate of manufacture of 3,000 large and 12,000 small mines per monthcan be obtained by tbe end of June 1940, provided available capacity is given at anearly date. Certain components could, it is hoped, be made in Canada. Inaddition, it is anticipated that 2,000 large and 4,000 small mines could be producedper month for other commitments. 10,000 large mines should be available by april 1940; the small type are not yet in production.Loading Ports for Minelayers.17. An investigation into possible loading ports for minelayers resultedin the Eyies or1 Loch Alsh being selected as being the most suitable from all points of view. In order to disperse the risk from, enemy action and to avoid the traffic congestion inevitable if large quantities of mines are dealt with atone place, a second embarkation port is essential. It has been suggestedthat Invergordon be used for this purpose, but the practicability of using Oban or the Fort William area is being investigated in case the Inver-gordon project has to be abandoned. It is estimated that embarkation arrange-ments at the Kyles of Loch Alsh could be ready by April 1940, and a secondembarkation port two or three months later, provided requirements weresimplified to the minimum. It is intended to obviate the necessity for large-scalemine-assembly depots, by arranging as far as possible for mines to be delivered bythe manufacturers as complete units.16. It is estimated that 10 ships will be required for laying mines and thatthe work of converting them to lay mines from two decks will take 4-5 months.Therefore, if a start is to be made to lay the barrage at the earliest practicablemoment, it is necessary to take up and convert the tonnage required forthwith.
Cost of the Mine Barrage.19. The estimated total oast, spread over a period of two years, is: Small mines  ......     t..      ...     ...     .-.     ... 10360,-000Large mines ...     ...     ............... 5,000,000-4-20 &quot;per cent, for various factors such as assembly andtesting plant at mine depots, rail and lighter trans-port charges, additional plant at contractors&apos; works,rising costs of production, &amp;c.      ...     .u     ... 3,000,000Works requirements ............     ...... 500,000Taking up and conversion of 10 ships for minelayiag ... 600,000Hire of ships......     ............... 480,000Dockyard plant at embarkation ports    ......... 125,000Total............     ......^19,705,000Other mining commitments during the first two years of war are estimated to cost  11,000.000. Had no question of the Northern Barrage arisen, it was anticipated that mining operations costing  25,200.009 would be carried out during the first two years of war. With the Northern Barrage, the total costduring two years amounts to  30,705,000; without the Northern Barrage 25,200,000. Thus the total additional cost, including all services, is estimated,as  5,505,000.20. When it is realised that a modem 15-knots meat ship with its cargo isworth in round figures  f million, and that a 12-knot tanker carrying 10,000 tonsof petrol,  330,000, the additional expenditure over normal estimates incurred by laying the Northern Barrage is a not unreasonable insurance for the safety ofsuch valuable ships. This is a long-term project, requiring at least six months of preparation and subsequently a year for completion. However, the minefield willbe partially and progressively effective from the time that the first mines are laid(as vras the case in 1918). Its moral effect will start from the declaration ofthe mined area and the laying of navigational marks.21. The Northern Barrage is a huge project, but like any minefield whichcannot be swept up, it is an offensive operation of which there are so few whichare practicable.22. Unless we lay the Northern Mine Barrage we  hall not have done every-thing possible to protect the trade which is vital to this country.
