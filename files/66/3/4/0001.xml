As a result   of thediscussion the War Cabinet:-&quot;(a)   Invited the Committee consisting of -The Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence,The Three Service Ministers,The Minister without Portfolio, andThe Three Chiefs of Staff,(which had been appointed at the iieeVngreferred to in the margin) to considerthe best methods by which this country could afford naval, military or airassistance to&quot;Turkey against aggression by Germanyand/or the U.S.S.R. on theassumption that Italy is an assured ncatral.(b)   Authorised the Minister for Co-ordinn &apos;.action of  Defence, as Chairman of the above committee, to arrange at his discretionfor a preliminary technical examinationof the problem by the. Chiefs of Staff.&quot;2.        In accordance uith  Conclusion (b) above, I arranr&amp;da preliminary technical examination of the problem by theChiefs of Staff.     Their Report   (Paper No, C.0.S.(S9)9i)is attached hereto.* W,M.(39) 54th Conclusions, Minute 6.

eiS    The Committee considered this Report on the 26thOctober, and desire to submit the following commentary andrecommendations to the War Cabinet.4.    We agree that we could not at the present time affordTurkey any support With land or air forces, unless Italianneutrality were absolutely assured.   This condition doesnot, however, necessarily apply to naval forces.5*    Prom the Juridical point of view we should be entitlsito send naval forces through the Dardanelles if Turkeyconsidered herself to be threatened.   It is not improbable that the Russians might, prior to a declaration of war,despatch forces to seize the Bosphorus in order to secure their Black Sea communications, and it might not be possiblein all circumstances for our naval forces to reach that areabefore the Russians.   Moreover it is doubtful whether theTurks could prevent such an occurence without our assistance.It is therefore essential that the Turkish Government should clearly understand that no time should be lost in invitingour naval forces to pass through the Straits in order to forestall such a surprise attack by the Russians.6.     We therefore recommend that the Pirst Lord of theAdmiralty should be invited to inform General Orbay in theabove sense and to say, without entering into any definitecommitment in the matter, that in the event of actual or threatened aggression against Turkey we should probablybe prepared to lend immediate assistance with naval forces.The Pirst Lord, in making this communication, to emphasise the importance of ensuring that the Turkish naval fcases araadequately defended for the use of our fleet, and suggestthat Staff Conversations on this question should be put iahand forthwith between the respective Naval Staffs.

7.        It will be seen from tho Report that,provided Italian neutrality is assured, substantialland and air forces could be made available from ourpresent resources in Palestine, Egypt and the Sudan.In addition, the Chief of the Imperial General Staffsuggested that we might draw upon our Colonial forcesin East and West Africa.8.        The despatch and subsequent maintenance of land and air forces, raise formidable administrative problems.Some months would elapse before the bulk of the land forces could operate in Turkey.9.        We recommend that the Chiefs of Staff shouldbe invited to institute a detailed enquiry into theadministrative implications of despatching to, and maintaining in, Turkey the forces contemplated inparagraphs 18 and 26 of their Report, and shouldestimate the time that would elapse between 1heissue of the order for their despatch and their concentration in Turkey.10.      The Report by the Chiefs of Staff deals only with the employment in aid of Turkey of the forces which could be made available f:&apos;om our existing resources in the Middle Easto     They inform us that they have under examination the much wider question of building upsubstantial reserves  .in that area   .in order to meetthe following contingencies:-(a) a combined Russo-German drive through the balkans on a v/ide front;or(b) a situation in which Germany appeared tobe cracking and we might be able tosway the Balkan bloc in our favour and take the offensive from that direction.We attach importance to this long-term study.

11.      In this connection the Secretary cf Statefor Var raised the question of the poasihility ofmaking our forces in the Middle Bast as far aspossible self-supporting by establishing factories in Palestine, which could utilise raw materialsdrawn from adjacent territories and countriesfurther to the East.     In his view there would be great strategic advantages, both in peace and war,in such an arrangenent.    Some of the committee felt that it would be seme time before a project ofthis kind could begin to bear fruit, but there was general agreement that it was worthy of careful examination as a long-term policy.12.      The Var Cabinet will recall (see W.M.(3953rd Conclusions, Minute 3(c)) that this proposals is already under discussion between the Ministry ofSupply and the Colonial Office.    We recommend thatthe War Office aid Air Ministry should furnish theMinistry of Supply with such information of theirrespective requirements as would form a basis for the examination of the project.13.        In paragraph 22 of their Report the Chief8of Staff point out the difficulties that may ariseover the question of Inter-Allied command of theforces in Turkey.    They regard it as nost important that the command of the Angle-French forces shouldbe vested in a British Commander-in-Chief.    7eentirely agree that this is desirable, but we donot think that the question can be decided inadvance.     The decision will probably depend on

the relative else of the French and Britishcontingents.    We recommend, however, that in no circumstances should our forces be placed under thecommend of a Turkish Commander-in-chief.(initialled)    C.Richmond Terrace, S.V.I.29th October, 1959.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.COPY NO.J?WAR OABTWBTchiefs m? ^^Ytsmn^is.,and/or w^E^mEm^^report we have been asked by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence to consider and report on thefollowing terms of reference:- ;&quot;On the assumption that Italy is an assuredneutral and that ix is necessary to assistTurkey against aggression by Germany and/orRussia, what naval, military and air forces could be made available for this purpose,and how should they be employed&apos;?Calculations should be based on theassumption that the forces in question willhave to be maintained in the Near East for aconsiderable period.NOTE.   For the purposes of thisappreciation it should be assumed that the French will make the full contribution of which, accordingto information already in ourpossession, they are capable;   butthe French Staff should not be consulted in regard to this problemuntil a de&quot;cision has been reached by the War Cabinet in regard to theextent and character of the Britisheffort.&quot;2..        The whole of the following -paragraphs, which deal with the assistance we could give to Turkey against german and/or Russian aggression, are based on theassumption that no military -precautions need be taken against the ^ontingftncsv^of Italian hostility.     this implies not only that Italian neutrality is assured at

-the- time a but that any change in her -attitude.may alsobe ruled out.---Bfe lay particular emphasis on this pointbecause some of the movements referred to in the remainder of this paper are such as might arouse serious misgivingsin the minds of the Italian Government.Naval Forces.3.        The main body of the Mediterranean Fleet is nowbased at Alexandria.     The available strength, under theorders-of-the Conmander-in-Chief,^JLs approximately as follows.&quot;-3 battleships.3 8&quot; gun cruisers.3 6&quot; gun cruisers.6 destroyers3 submarines    ))   at Malta.12 M.T.B. )If required these forces would be immediately available tosail for Turkish waters, but a reinforcement of 2 flotillasof destroyers-from home would be required.4.        The most suitable-jdefended harbours in Turkey foraccommodating-a fleetare at Ismid (inside the Sea of marmora) and at Smyrna.     Ismid alone possesses repairfacilities for a fleet.    Our information, with regard tothe local defences of the Turkish naval oases is incomplete,and our knowledge of the A.A. defences is particularlylacking.5.        If Foissia or Germany attacked Turkey, Bulgaria mightpermit her air bases to be used by German bombers forces. Ismidis only 125 miles jfroni/tlifi^Bul^ar

than .S00 miles from Philippopolis.     It is under-stood. tnr.t there tire ct present cone 9 aerodromesof varying size   end quality  in Bulgaria  cootfliich modern bombers could be operatod.      It ispossible, therefore, that a substantial scale of attackcould be brought to beer against Turkey from these bases,particularly after they had been improved and extended.6.     If the Russians or Germans are only threatening,the prompt arrival of the British Mediterranean Fleet in strength at Iemid would be most opportune from the point ofview of encouraging the Surka.    But if the threat developedintoJioatile.Jaction, the position of naval foroas at I amid,if inadequately defended, might be rendered untenable by air action.     The effect of a precipitate withdrawal of theFleet in these circumstances would be most unfortunate;it would be better that it should never have been sent.7.     Smyrna is the alternative, and possesses a fineharbour, but the local naval defences aro in an unsatisfac-tory state, and-inadequate for protecting the Fleet againstsubmarine attack.     Only light indicator nets are availablelocally, and these are insufficient for the requirementsof the port-     There are no booms.8.     Submarine attack on the fleet in Smyrna is improbablebut cannot be excluded-     The passage of the Bosporusand Dardanelles would, however, be extremely hazardousfor Russian submarines, particularly if the anti-submarinenet defencesx at Ghanak had been placed.     On the otherhand, we can here nc Tertpinty of excluding Germanx  These are new heavy nets, and are kept with thenet-laying vessels at Chanak

submarines from the Mediterranean.9.     It appears, therefore, that    an essential preliminary to sending any part of our fleet toTurkish waters would be  to   ascertain forthwith the6tate of the air defences and of the local navaldefences at Smyrna, with a view to making good the deficiencies in advance of the flecfs arrival.This question would have to be referred to ourCommanders in the Middle East to be taken up withthe Turks as a matter of urgency.10.   If Germany attacked Turkey the mediterranean fleet&apos;s immediate task would be to protect sea communications with Turkey and to co-operate inContraband Control;    the use of Turkish harbourswould be required for our light forces.     If we foundourselves at war with SusBia, our strategy would be tokeep the Russian naval forces shut up in the black sea by the closing of the Dardanelles and Bosporusin the first instance,  and later on, at our chosentime, to operate against them in the Black Sea.11.   Despite the unsatisfaofcpry state of the defencesof the Turkish bases for our heavy ships, their use by our light forces should enable us to provide adequate security for oar Meo-i+^Mediterranean^etm sea comnunica-tions t- Turkey-

Land Forces.    - &apos;12.      An attack nn Turkey would sUmost certainly be combined with-attacks upon, or threats to, other Britishinterests in the Middle East, and in estimating thesupport which we could provide for Turkey we must allow forthe forces necessary to safeguard such of those interests as are essential.     These are the maintenance of internal security In Palestine and Egypt, including the Canal Zone,and the protection of the Anglo-Iranian oilfields.     Wehave also treaty obligations to Iraq, but the defence ofIraq must be placed :ln a lower category of importance inthe situation we are considering.IS.       In Palestine there are eight infantry &quot;rattalionsend two cavalry regimental-earmarked for the maintenance-of-jTttemnl .security,..and these -cannot be counted on forany other purpose.     There are also stationed in Egypt, theSudan and Palestine approximately--cne armoured,division andtwo infantry-divisions.14. The equivalent of one division would be requiredfor the -safeguarding. .of the-essential interests, apart from palestine, referred to in paragraph 12 above. The removalof the threat of war with Italy would therefore release for operations elsevdiere one division and one armoured division from the troops at present stationed in Egypt and the Sudan.15.      The land forces which we could send to Turkey, are limited primarily by administrative considerations, not by the numbers r*which-Could. be T&amp;ade^yailable^-f or the

following jreasohs:- i(a) A British Army in Turkey, could only &quot;bemaintained by sea, since the Anatolian railways are insufficient for the purpose.(b) Large-scale base development, including air defences, would have to be carried out beforethe despatch of the force     No base and L.of C. units are at present available in theMiddle Bast, nor anti-aircraft units for baseprotection on an adequate scale.   These wouldhave to be provided from Great Britain.16.      A British Expeditionary Force of four divisionstook some 4 or 5 weeks to concentrate in France, thisafter months of preliminary staff work, with first-classbases and railways available, a short sea voyage and all theshipping resources of Great Britain^     The administrative difficulties in despatching a large force from the Middle east to Turkey would be infinitely greater and would takecorrespondingly-longer0     The project is not one that couldbe carried out under a matter of months.17.      Once we were at war with Russia, India would cease tobe a source of reserves owing to the potential threat to afghanistan and the North West Frontier,,    We should have to rely on our resources in the Middle East, supplementedat a later date by troops from Great Britain and the Dominions.18.      Taking into account all the above considerations we estimate that the forces which could be sent to Turkey&apos;sassistance would be as follows:-(a)   Within a month or two of the outbreak of war withRussia (depending on the&quot;&quot;availabiiity ofsuitable shipping).1 field regiment R.A, ) From1 medium regiment R.A. ) Egypt1 anti-tnnk regiment R.A.        )From the 1 and the1 or 2 loedixBT tank battalions. ; armoured ) Sudan.division

There is only one British anti-aircraft battery inEgypt;   The various conflicting claims on this battery,including the defence of the Anglo-Iranian oilfields, wouldhave to be taken into account and settled at the time.(b) As soon as a base and adequate anti-aircraftprotection at the base had Deen developed (amatter of some months7^One armoured division from Egypt, less those unitsalready sent under (a) above.Dp to a division from the Jfiddle East, to bereplaced to the necessary extent by units drawn from Africa.Further reinforcements according to the generalsituation existing at the time, particularlyin France.It is understood that the French intend to provide twoor more dlvisAdifs^f rom-Syria at -ihisjlater- stage.19.        Although the -military assistance we can offer to-turkey in the early stages is small, it should be noted&apos;that she has not yet asked for anything more than certain technical-unitsJ- It-is some of these technical units which we should be offering at the outset of hostilities.20.        The scale of immediate military support which wecould provide in the event of Russia being neutral, and adrive into the Balkans being conducted by Germany alone,would be unaltered, since the limiting factor of maintenancewould remain until bases had been developed.21.        Whatever form an attack on Turkey might takeBritish reinforcements would have to be confined eitherto Thrace, or to Salonika, for which we have accepted ajoint defensive commitment with the French under Article 4of the Military Convention...   The maintenance of any but the smallest detachmen.t-on.the Cwcasia^front--woiild be aJ7-

matter of the-great ^i^admiiastrativie difficulty.Moreover this front is of much Ijess -strateg-Ur-fLi gni n f-flr^ft,,22.      The question.of -command of the allied forcessupporting Turkey may present some difficulty.   unified command of at least the Anglo-French forces would clearly be most desirable^   The responsibility for the securityof the sea communications and for the maintenance of theforces in &quot;Turkey would fall ;ipc.n the 3ritish, and in any event the Middle Bast is predominantly a British sphere of interest.   We consider it essential, therefore., thatthe Allied Commander-in--Chief siioulo be a British ucneral.There is however the difficulty that General Weygand hasassumed coiumand of the French Array of the Levant, andhe is too senior an officer tc serve in a subordinate&apos; position.   A further possible complication is the factthat the Turkish Marshal Fevsi Chavmak is also a verysenior officer, and acutely conscious of his seniority.He might claim supreme command of all forces in Turkey,including the Franco-British contingent.   This wouldhave to be resisted.:   Further discussions with the Frenchonlhis question will obviously be required.23.      Before leading the question of land forces, we must emphasise that our Commsnder-s in the Kiddle East wouldhave to be consulted before any large-scale plans for the reinforcement of Turkey were decided on.   A large amountof detailed staff work would be involved before bases and communications could be developed.Air Forces.24.      The present air forces in Egypt ares-6 Bobber Souadroais2 Bomber Transport Squadrons3 Fighter Squadrons and1 Army Co-oper&amp;tion Squadron.In addition there is one Bomber Squadron in Iraq.,and two in the Sudan0   -g-.

25.    Even if the Egyptian Government were willing to agree tothe Yeooval of all our air forces from Egypt, we should probably have to retain, at least initially, one squadron in Egypt againstthe possibility of serious disaffection in that country.     Itwould also be undesirable immediately to denude the Sudan of ailair forces.26.     If Germany only were the enemy we might send as many asseven bomber, one A.C. and three fighter squadrons to supportTurkey.    In the event of Russian hostility it seems inevitable that we should have to despatch air reinforcements, includingfighters, to India - whether or not it had proved possible towithdraw   to India the two bomber squadrons now at Singapore.Site consider, therefore, that it would be unwise to rely on more than a maximum of four bomber , one A.C., and possibly as many as two fighter squadrons to support Turkey.     In theevent of a large concentration of Russian lon^-range bombersin the Central Asian Military District we mi^ht even have tosend   two fighter squadrons to India.27.     It must be borne in mind that although the squadrons inEgypt have, on the whole, satisfactory reserves of aircraft,they have very inadequate reserves of personnel.     Moreover,neither in aircraft nor personnel are they sufficiently wellprovided to carry on sustained operations for any considerable period, and any reinforcements can only be found from theUnited Kingdom. ,28.     The time which must elapse before any of these units could operate in support of Turkey would depend upon:-(a) The location oftheir new aerodromes.(b) The extent to which previous preparations have been madeat these aerodromes in respect of petrol, S.A.A., bombs,aerodrome equipment, ground defences and personnel,etc(c) The communications and means of transport availablebetween the present and future aerodromes of the forces.29.    As matters stand to-day, it is considered that one month isthe minimum time which the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle-9-

East, would require in order to make the necessary preliminaryarrangements for such a move, on the assumption that he receivedfull collaboration from Turkey from the outset.50.    Alternative dispositions would have to be prepared to meetthe three possible hypotheses of(a) German attacks(b) German and Russian attack.(c) Russian attack.In the first two instances the main air threat would be to western Turkey, whereas if Russia alone were attacking Turkeythe threat would be from the -Hast.31.     For (a) and (b), therefore, our bomber squadrons shouldbe located in Western Turkey.     Our fighters also would berequired in that area in the event of German hostility, withparticular reference to the protection of our base ports against air attack from Bulgaria.52.     In the event of Russian attack alone, the main dangerand the most vulnerable points at which to hit Russia tjould beon the Caucasian front, and our bomber squadrons mi^ht be located at Marbekir and liosul, whence they could attack the Russianlines of coirounication into Turkey and Iran   and also threaten the Caucasian oil fields.     Such fijhters as can be spared fro,the defence of India nijht be allocated for the protection againstRijssian attack of our bomber aerodromes, or of objectives inIraq, particularly the Anglo-Iranian oil fields.53*     If our sjuadrons &quot;ere to operate from bases in Iraq andDiarbekir it should be possible, providing that the conditionsof paragraph 29 are satisfied, for them to start-operations--atreduced efficiency on dates varying from Z t 2 to Z * 10.Owing to the complexity of the administrative problem and thenumber of unknown factors involved, it would be unsafe to slvdany estimate of the time factor for the operation of squadronselsewhere in Turkey.

Further reinforcements wouldhave to come from outside the Middle East.(vi) Two or more French divisions might also be sent atthis stage from Syria, but it is essential thatthe command of the Allied Forces should be inBritish hands.(vii) Before any large reinforcements could be sent to turkey, detailed staff conversations with theTurks would be necessary.Air Forces.(viii) The extent to which we could afford air support to turkey would depend lar^oly on. thrs Russian threat toIndia.
