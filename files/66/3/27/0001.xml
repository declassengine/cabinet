CABII3ET.AIR RE^UTTC.^5TS OF TIE ABMV LIT FRANCE.gemorandua by the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.Tart I.I was asked hy the &apos;^ar Cabinet at their meeting on 8th November - W.L. (39)75, liinnte 8, Conclusion 5, - to workout in association with the two Departments a scheme for agreedtypes and numbers of the machines mentioned in conclusion h.A copy of the conclusions is reproduced in Annex II to this Paper.2.       By arrangement vith the Secretaries of State for Warand Air, I held t.;o meetings accordingly with the D. C.I.G.S.and the D.C.A.S. representing the General and Air Staffs, atwhich the general problem was investigated and certain possiblesolutions were considered.     At the second meeting I also hadthe advantage of the presence of Lt.-General Pownall, Chie^ ofStaff to the Commander-in-Chief, B.E.F., the Secretary of Statefor War having arranged for him to come over to London.3*       As a result of the progress made at these two meetings,I requested the two Deputy Chiefs of Staff to continue thediscussions without me and to endeavour to obtain an agreed solution of the problem within the limits of the Cabinet decisionsad likely to be acceptable to the two Services.   I am nowable to report that ^ir Marshal Peirse and major-General liass^rhave prepared in full agreement a proposed solution which Ihave carefully examined with them, and which is appended as annex I to this Memorandum.h.       Nature of the Proposals.The proposs&apos;2 scheme which is based on the analogy of

-frBS-ffristins Relationship between the Royal Navy and the Coastal(jcraaand, R.A.F., is generally as f ollowsi-(a) an HA.F. Command to be established in France toco-ordinate the operations of all R.A.F. units therej(o) The Commander to be designated the Air OfficerCotmanding-in-Chief, British Air Forces in France,his position being similar to that of the Commander-in-chief, B.E.F., except that he will not be under any French Commander.(c) The Command will include all the bomber squadrons ofAvthe Advanced^Striking Force in France, which willbe detached from the bomber command.(d) The -advanced Air Striking Force, or any part of it,when ordered to operate in conjunction with the bomber command in some strateRic operation, otherthan in support of the armies in Prance, will passtemporarily under the command of the A.0.0.-in-C*,Bomber Command, who will issue operation orders direct to the A. O.C. Advanced Air Striking F&quot;orce.It is agreed that such an order would only be given by the Chiefs of Staff Committee with u;ar Cabinet- . sanction.(e) The Air component of the B.E.F. will he absorbed intothe new coamand but will remain under its own A.O.C,who will act as adviser to the Commander-in-Chief,B.E.F. and under his operational control.(f) The A.O.C. -in-C. will be charged with the responsibilityof seeing that the Conaander-In-Chief, B.B.F- has atall times &quot;full assurances regarding air support&quot;.Accordingly, he will place at the &quot;disposal of theCcsmsander-in-Chief&quot; such bomber squadrons as the &quot;latter may, in consultation with him, consider necessary from time to time.

.. (g)The precise arrangements te give effect to -thfndecision to be concerted in detail between theCommander-in-chief, B.E.F., and the A.O.C. -in-C.British Air Forces in France, who will consult, as necessary, the French Sigh  Command.5. Training.Satisfactory arrangements are made for training anilare referred to in paragraph 4 of Annex I.    This system isalready in operation.6. The availability of forces required by the Army.There are at present in France with the Advanced air striking Force 10 bomber squadrons, a total of 160 bombers.It will be recalled that in Paper        (39) 330 the lord privy seal, as Chairman of the Land Forces Coaaaittee, stated that&quot;the Army requirement of bomber aircraft is assessed by theITar Office as 250 first-line aircraft on the basis of 15divisions s together with the necessary maintenance reserves of pilots and machinesa.     I am informed that this figure of 250,arrived at at a combined General and Air Staff meeting, was a rough-and-ready calculation of the number of bombers whichmight be required to support an Army of about 32 divisionsdefending itself against an attack on a 30 mile front acrossan arbitrarily selected bit of country in France.7. It is recognised that the air requirements of an Armycannot be calculated on a divisional basis;   they depend ratherupon the length of front held, the probable scale of attack, aswell as the type of aircraft and. the nature of the terrain over which the attack must pass.    At the same time it is fair toassume that the larger the size of the B.E.F. the greater thenumber of boabsrc *h**t should be allotted for its support,although it does not necessarily follow to my Trind that this increase of air support should be oro rata.    The intention ofthe Cabinet, however, was not at this moment to look too far

AA *ahead, but rather to concentrate on our requirements in thisrespect for the next twelve months. &apos;8.        I had, however, to ascertain generally whether, ifthe Cabinet accepted the proposed solution, it would be clearthat the Air Ministry &apos;s plan for production would provide thenumber of bashers of a suitable type eventually likely to berequired for supporting the Army.9.       There are at present 16 first-line squadrons of medium bombers, i.s. 256 aircraft (Battles and Blenheims) inthe Metropolitan Air Force.     Of these 10 are in France, and remain at hose.     Zhus there are already available the numberof aircraft estixaced to be necessary on the basis described in paragraph 6 above.10.      As it sc happens the Air Ministry programme alreadyprovides for the continued production of sufficient medium bombers to maintain a force rather in excess of this figureuntil 1942.I am informed by the Air Staff that for operationsother than in support of the Army they propose to replace thesedium bomber by heavier types.     As, therefore, heavy bomberproduction increases with the passage of time, there will beless likelihood of say medium bombers being withdrawn from theA.O.C. -in-C., British Air Forces in France for operations underBomber Command (see Annex I, paragraph 5).32.      Air Cogponent. v &quot;I am informed -that all arrangements are also made toensure that the Air Component is strengthened pari-passu asthe Army increases.Having discassed the proposed solution with the Secretaryof State for &quot;&quot;Ear and t he Secretary of State for Air and obtainedtheir general concurrence, and wxth the assurances as to supplyreferred to in paragraphs 6-1C, I recommend approval of the agreed solution,

PART II.Development of Prototypes.It will be remembered that conclusion 1 of w.H. (39) 75, Minute 8, was worded as follows:-&quot;(1) that steps for   the development of prototypes ofan aircraft susceptible to mass-productionmethods, and complying as nearly as possibleAlthough not within the instructions from mycolleagues, I considered it desirable, after discussing thematter with the Lord Privy Seal- to look into this Question tosome extent.      Accordingly on the 10th November I interviewedColonel Moore-Brabazon who, it will be remembered, had made certain proposals to the Land  Forces Committee for massproduction for special aircraft suitable for  Army purposesonly.     Colonel Moore-Brabazon offered to proceed at onoe toManchester to investigate the possibilities further.He reported to me on the 16th November that he had had to rule out any question of a simple single-engined pusher-type of machine as, although it had attractions, it could notbe produced straight off the board and time would be wasted.There was, however, the possibility of a twin-engined machineof the following specification:-He believed that if every support was given to this problem,with the requirements of the  War Office,should be continued as a matter of urgency.&quot;Single seater.Gross weight 6,500 lbs.Range 3 hours.Bomb load 400 lbs.normal;   up to1,000 lbs. overload.4c Browning Guns forward.Speed 200 m.p.h. max.Cruising 170.Economic 120.Ceiling 22,000 ft.Pilot armoured against-rifle fire.the production could start at the end of 1940 and reach 100 aweek quickly.No prototype would be necessary.

A first-class designer would have to he secured, and production iaconjunction with mass-producing engineering to he undertaken undera suitable manufacturer, such as Messrs. JDZLD.14.       I consulted the Secretary of State for Air on thisproposal and he informed me he considered protection of a mwrihinaas suggested went far beyond any original intention of tbe land forces Committee or the   War Cabinet.      He emphasised that the speedy which would he 130 xs.p.h. slower than the standard Germanfighter9 and the lack of rear gun protection were serious defects,,The engine required (the Cheetah) was already folly counted on for training requirements, and duplication in the time rasaimpracticable.    He was straggly opposed to the proposal,15.        The Secretary of   State for ISar, on the other hand,proposed that a prototype of this machine should be produced asa matter of urgency, and that all arrangements, such as thepreparation of tools, etc,, should be ready for mass production as soon as the prototype was passed by the two Services.16.       It is clear that even If such a machine as suggestedby Colonel Moore-Brabazon -ma satisfactory, production could notstart until 1941 and then only, in the opinion of the AirMinistry, by considerably affecting their planned programme.Moreover this ma chine would be very definitely inferior in all respects to the medium bomber which the Army would now heassured of by the proposals in Part I of this Eemorandumo17.       I therefore further discussed the question with theLord Privy Seal and Colonel Hoore-Brabazon on the 50th november.The conclusion was arrived at that, in view of the new proposals in Part I and as it appeared clear that the A2Ejy&apos;s needs would now be well met by existing types of medium hBE&amp;ers, thusenabling existing sources of production to cmfeinue their

prograjsisa and the creation of new sources of supply to boavoided, it would be wisest to abandon further action onColonel Hoore-Braaazan&apos;s proposal for production.IB.       There resains for consideration and Cabinet decision,in accordance with conclusion 1 of W.M. (59) 75, Minute 8,whether the design and production of a special army supportprototype should be proceeded with.2 hope the above examination of the problem will facilitate a discussion of this question.&apos;/ .(Initialled)   C.Richmond Terrace, S.W.X.,2nd December,, 1339.

HCIi ^LiBIHSSIOH TOLORD C:iA.T?IELD.The V/air Cabinet at its meeting s held on 8th November, 1939 had under consideration variousMemoranda on the air requirements for the Army.    The&quot;.?ar Cabinet agreed, inter alia:-X X X&quot;(3) that in present circumstances it was essential that the whole of our air striking Force should be availablefor whatever purpose the strategical situation might requires(h) that, subject to (3), the Army shouldhave full assurances regarding air support, and with a view to operationsnext year: a proportion of suitablemachines should be earmarked for work with the Army, these machines tobe at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief unless some emergency arosewhich made it necessary to use themfor other purposes:(5) to invite the liinister for Co-ordinationof Defence to work out, in association with the Departments, a scheme foragreed types and numbers of the machines mentioned in Conclusion (h)&quot;.     X2o       The following arrangements, which are based onthe analogy of the relationship between the Royal Havyand the Coastal Command R.A.F., have been agreed betweenthe General and Air Staffs to meet Conclusions (3) and(4) above.3.       An R.A.F. Command will be formed in France toco-ordinate the operations of all R.A.F. units in France.The Commander of this force will be designated the air officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Air Forces in France.His position vis-a-vis his own Government will be similarto that of the commands-in-Chief, British Expeditionarym See W.H. (39)75th Conclusions, Minute ;8.-3^

Force, hut he will not he under the ordexs of any PreachGenaralok&apos;        This Command will include all the &quot;bomber squadrons of the Advanced Air striking Force in France, which willbe detached from Bomber Command.    These squadrons will receive such special training as may be necessary for workin support of the Array.    The type of training to be carriedout will be decided by the General and Air Staffs inconsultation, and arrangements fur training will be madeby the above Staffs conjointly.    In order, however, to preserve the homogeneous character of the British bomber force as a whole, and to ensure that the A.A.S.F. remainsfit tD take its place with the Itomber Command in any majorair operations of whatever character ( see paragraph 1,Conclusion 3 above), the Commander-in-Chief, 3omber Command,will continue to be responsible for the training of theA. A. b.F., other than the special training mentioned at thebeginning of this paragraph.5*        -Then the Advanced Air Striking Force is allotted to operate in conjunction with Bomber Ccsauand in some major air operation other than in support of the armies in France (see ^paragraph 1, Conclusions (3) and (4) above),the operational control of that force will pass temporarilyto A.O.C.-in-C, Bomber Consaand, who will issue operationorders direct to the A.O.C., Advanced Air Striding Force.For this reason, and for that outlined in paragraph h above,it is essential that good ccsnmuoications should bemaintained between H.     Bomber Command and A-A.S.F.8as well as H.Q. British Air Forces in France.    Moreover,A-O.C.-in-C*, bomber Command must he iept constantlyinformed of the state of readiness for action of the A.A.S.F.

6.       She Air Oxnponent of the British ExpeditionaryForce will he absorbed into the new Command, but willremain as at present under the Command of an A.Q.C whowill continue to act as air adviser to the C-in-C.,B.E.F., and under his operational control.7*       The A. 0.C-in-C., British Air Forces in Prance willbe charged with the responsibility of seeing that theCommnTider-in-chief, B.E.F., has at all times &quot;fullassurances regarding air support &apos;.    Accordingly, theA. Oo C. -in-C. will place &quot;at the disposal of the Commaader-in-Chief&quot; such bomber squadrons as the latter may, inconsultation withhim, consider necessary from time to time.6.       The fact that the B.L.F. are holding only a fraction of the Allied line creates a complication, since it is clearly necessary that British bomber units in france should be allocated in accordance with the day-to-dayneeds of the Allied situation on the Western Front as awhole.9.        The precise arrangements which should be uade to  iveeffect to the system outlined in this Paper should beconcerted in detail between the C-in-C., B.E.F, and theA. 0. C-in-C, British Air Forces in France, imnediatelythe latter is appointed.    In devising these arrangements,the two CommandeiB-in-Chief would of course take the french high Command into consultation.10.      In the event of disagreenaat on this or any othermatter, the question at issue will be referred to theChiefs of Staff.(Signed)   S.E.C. PEIESK.I1.C.A.S.n        H.R.S. MASSY.*. .
