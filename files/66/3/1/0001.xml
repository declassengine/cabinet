NAVAL SITUATION.Home Waters General.A full enquiry into the circumstances attending the sinking of the.M:S. Royal Oak whilst at anchor in Scapa Flow during the nignt of the13th-14th October, is being made. It seems clear that it was the work of aU-boat which succeeded in escaping from Scapa Flow after the attack.German Attach on Trade.2. On the 21st October the North and South-bound East Coast Convoyswere attacked by German aircraft. No damage to ships, or casualties, weresustained. The Naval escorts included special A/A defence cruisers. Detailsof attacks are given in the air section of this resume.3. The U-boat activity, which broke out afresh on the 12th October, hascontinued during the period under review, although their efforts have been moresporadic and widely dispersed. The first really definite report of a U-boatin distant waters was received from H.M.S. Danae, which sighted a submarine700 miles W. of Walfisch Bay (W. Coast of S. Africa) on the 24th October.This submarine may have been responsible for a report which was received froman unidentified British Merchant vessel that she was being attacked by gunfirein the same area two days earlier.4.  Five British ships, of a total tonnage of 19,968 tons, have been sunk by submarine action during the last week: S.S. Sea Venture (2,327 tons), North Sea.S.S. Clan Chisholm (7,256 tons), 150 miles N.W. of Cape Finisterre,in Convoy.S.S. Tafna (4,413 tons), Menin Ridge (2,474 tons) and Ledbury(3,528 tons), 90 miles W. of Gibraltar.Two British ships have been sunk by mine in the North Sea S.S. Orsa (1,478tons) and Whitemantle (1,(592 tons).Four neutral ships were sunk in the North Sea, viz.: By U-boat-Swedish S.S. Gustav Adolf (926 tons);By mine-Norwegian S.S. Deodata (3,295 tons);Swedish S.S. Albania (1,241 tons);Greek S.S. K. Hadjipateras (5,962 tons).5. During the week news was received of the sinking of S.S. Stonegate(5,044 tons) in a position 500 miles E. of Bermuda on the 5th October by a raiderbelieved to be the Deutschland. This ship stopped the United States shipCity of Flint on the 9th October, transferred crew of Stonegate to her and put an armed guard on board. The City of Flint remained with Deutschland untilthe 15th October, then proceeded to Tromso, where she arrived on the21st October and landed the Stonegate&apos;s crew. Later the same day she sailed, andis reported to have arrived in the Kola Inlet.The Deutschland also sank the Norwegian S.S. L. W. Hansen (1,918 tons) onthe 14th October, in position about 400 miles E. of Cape Race, and latertransferred the crew to the Norwegian S.S. Kongsdal, which landed them atKirkwall on the 21st October.6.  Losses of shipping by enemy action up to noon the 26th October, were:  .Number.Tonnage.220,02442,05066,848BritishAlliedNeutral51627Total84328,922
Antisubmarine Operations. -&apos;i7.  Apart from the attacks on merchant ships which have occurred, therehave been few definite contacts with U-boats during the week.  Fourteen huntshave been carried out.  In two cases in the Western Approaches, and in anothercase in the North Sea, it is possible that some damage was inflicted.Keppell on the 24th attacked a contact 100 miles West of Gibraltar,following the sinking of three ships there, without definite result.Following attacks carried out by the Patrol Vessel Puffin and TrawlerCayton Wyke on the 24th October, U.14 (small type) was found wrecked on theGoodwin Sands the following day.Convoys.8. Of the ships sunk by submarine this week only one ship S.S. ClanChisholm was sunk while in convoy. This ship was in the same convoy as the- S.S. Yorkshire and City of Mandalay previously reported, but the information wasnot received in time for this sinking to be included in Weekly Resume&quot; No. 7.Convoy has now been instituted for ships carrying iron-ore from Narvik toMethil.In view of raider activities in the N. Atlantic, steps have been taken toprovide additional protection for the transatlantic convoys. French naval forces are co-operating.The total number of vessels convoyed since the convoy system came intooperation is now 1,949, and of these only 6 have been lost (-3 per cent.).Mining.9. Special action is being taken to overcome the mining danger in the comparatively shallow waters of the East Coast route.The Dover barrage was completed during this week, and the first section ofa deep minefield off Flamborough Head has also been laid.German Merchant Shipping.10. Six German merchant ships were intercepted by the Northern Patrol S.S. Phoebus (8,863 tons), Gloria (5,896 tons), Bianca (1,675 tons), Poseidon (5,864tons), Biscaya (6,369 tons), and Gonzeheim (4,574 tons). All except the latter ship,which scuttled herself, have been sent in.Economic Warfare. -11. Last week 128 ships were detained for examination. With 47 still under detention from the week before, the total number of ships dealt with was175, or nearly 50 per cent, more than in any previous week. It is not possible togive the details of cargo seized in prize this week as the lists have not yet beencompleted. In some cases the delay in clearing ships from Contraband control bases is due to the non-arrival of satisfactory guarantees as to the final destination of cargoes consigned to neutral ports.12. There are considerable difficulties in exercising an efficient contraband control in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean. Up to date it has proved possible to seize comparatively few cargoes. The intelligence preparation forcontraband control is a special problem in the Mediterranean area. As Yugo-slavia and Italy are both contiguous to Germany and other neutral MediterraneanStates are well placed for trading with her, this question has become an urgentone.THE MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.General.- 13.. During the last week the British Expeditionary Force has continued the preparation of field works.. As a result of the operations on the Moselle-Rhine front, the French have withdrawn from German territory, and, speaking generally, the dividing line between the two armies is now the national boundary.   .[20203] B 2
Operations. i,r&apos;;,?A14. On the Moselle-Rhine front the abnormal activity of the 16th-17thOctober, which was described in our last week&apos;8 resume, has not continued.Reports since that date indicate that the Germans have been concentrating^ the consolidation and defence of their newly won positions. On the 18th October, fora reason which was at the time believed to be political, the Germans withdrewtheir troops from all French territory previously held by them. The reason,however, to which this move was attributed no&apos; longer holds good, since theirpatrols crossed the French frontier again on the 20th October.The Rhine front has been quiet throughout the week. The river is in fullflood and several casemates in the Kehl and Istein areas are surrounded bywater, and are believed to have been evacuated.Enemy Movements.15. Reports have been received of considerable movements of troops from east to west through Stettin and Hamburg. These are probably troops whichhave been sent by sea from East Prussia, but no details are yet known of theformations involved. There has also been a report of the arrival of units of an armoured division in Munster.Several reports have been received of troop movement towards Moravia andSlovakia, of troop trains on their way to the west being stopped and sent backto Moravia, and of troops from Poland arriving in Vienna by road and being sent in a north-easterly direction soon after arrival. These reports, which havenot yet been confirmed, may indicate either that troops are being sent toSlovakia and thence to South Poland for garrison duties or that the internal situation in Moravia and Slovakia requires additional troops for security duties.There has been some railway activity on the Freiburg-Basle line. Otherwise,little information has been received regarding local troop movement on theWestern Front, but bad weather has made air reconnaissance difficult and on some days impossible. It is certain, however, that some troop movement musthave taken place since the number of divisions identified on this front hasincreased.Distribution of enemy forces.16. The distribution of forces in Western Germany is now believed to beas follows: North Sea- includingRheineExcluding   Rheine including AachenExcluding    Aachen-Moselle -Moselle - Saar - RhineUpper Rhine....Complete Formationsidentified.2 infantry divisions....1 armoured division....3 light divisions13 infantry divisions1 motor division12 infantry divisions1 armoured division....2 motor divisions27 infantry divisions13 infantry divisions ....Elements only ofFurther Formations.1 armoured division.5 infantry divisions.&apos;2 infantry divisions.2 armoured divisions.1 light division.8 infantry divisions.:2 infantry divisions and tank units.It will be seen that seventy-five enemy divisions, compared with sixty-five aweek ago, have been identified, together with elements of a further sixteendivisions. The greatest density is still in the Moselle-Rhine sector. This shouldnot, however, be taken to indicate that that sector is necessarily where an attackis to take place. The headquarters of General Blaskowitz have been moved fromthe neighbourhood of Frankfort-on-Main to Dusseldorf, and a report allegesthat he is assembling an army in the Dusseldorf-Neuss-Krefeld area,i.e., opposite the Dutch frontier. General Blaskowitz is one of the bestcommanders in the German Army.The locations of the armoured, light and motorised divisions produce no definite pointers as to the future course of events.  The greatest concentration of
elements of mechanised forces appears, admittedly, to be in the Koln-DiJsseldom-Aachen area. It is necessary, however, to bear in mind that theGerman General Staff may consider that this area would be suitable for operation by British armoured formations. Latest reports indicate movements of tankssouthward from the Dusskldorf area towards the Moselle-Rhine sector of theWestern Front.German Army.Morale.&apos;.17. The following notes have been made from a French General Staff reporton German morale obtained by questioning prisoners of war. The statements of these prisoners, all of whom came from the Maine-Wiesbaden district, may to some extent have been made in order to get better treatment, and should there-fore not be taken as the general attitude of the German soldier on the western front: (i) Food.Insufficient in quantity, of poor quality, monotonous; little meat.Brought up in a mobile cooker every twenty-four hours at about noon, or,in the case of advanced elements, at night by fatigue parties. Foodarrives cold and unappetising.(ii) Clothing.Each man has spare under-clothing and boots, a greatcoat and abivouac tent. No blankets. Men have to sleep in pill boxes on theground, using their greatcoats and bivouac tents as covering. Prisonerscomplained of intense cold at night.(iii) Officers and N.C.O.s.Very strict with men.  Unpopular.(iv) Propaganda.Soldiers do not read newspapers. What is the use ? They all repeat the same thing and nobody believes them!(v) State of Morale.In Germany many things are unobtainable, chocolate, for example.Everybody is afraid of his neighbour; concentration camps are the lot of those who complain. That is why the country appears to follow itsrulers.The Ten Commandments of the German Soldier.18. The following &quot;Ten Commandments of the. German Soldier&quot; areprinted in the inside cover of every German soldier&apos;s pay book. They read asfollows: (i) The German soldier fights for the victory of his people.  Cruelty anduseless destruction are beneath his dignity,(ii) Every combatant must be uniformed or wear a badge which is clearlyvisible from a reasonable distance. It is forbidden to fight in civilianclothes without such a badge.(iii) No enemy who surrenders may be killed, not even snipers or spies.These will be brought to justice later by a military court.(iv) Prisoners of war must not be maltreated or insulted, nor may their personal property be touched..(v) Dum-dum bullets must not be used.   It is forbidden to convertprojectiles into dum-dum bullets.(vi) The Red Cross is not to be violated. Enemy wounded are to be treated with consideration.   Army medical staff and field chaplaina mustnot be hindered whilst carrying out their duties. .......;[80203] *   &quot; B 3
(vii) The civil population is not to be attacked.  Soldiers are forbidden toplunder. Historic monuments and buildings devoted to churchservices, art, science or public welfare are to be treated with special care. The civic population must not be asked for services of any kind without orders from superior officers and without indemnification.(viii) Neutral territory may neither be crossed by air nor by land.  It is for-bidden to turn neutral territory into a sphere of operations.(ix) If a German soldier is taken prisoner he must, if asked, state his name and rank.   On no account is he allowed to disclose to what unit hebelongs or to make any statements on military, political or economic-conditions in Germany; he must not be induced to do so either by   jpromises or by threats.(x) Any soldier disobeying these orders will be punished.  If the enemyviolates any of the commandments (i) to (viii), such violations are tobe reported immediately. Retaliation measures are only permissibleby order of the Higher Command.Retirement of German Officers.19. There is no confirmation of the Press report of the 23rd October, which stated that a number of senior German officers on both the Active and ReserveLists had been relieved of their command for supporting a restoration of theGerman monarchy. Among officers alleged to have been retired were Generalvon Hammerstein (who was Chief of Staff before General von Fritsch) andGeneral von Stulpnagel (Deputy G.I.G.S.).Sonet Russia.Entry of Soviet troops into Estonia.20. The movement of Soviet forces into Estonia, which was provided for inthe Soviet-Estonian Pact and had been postponed, took place on the 18th october and was accomplished without incident. Reports show that the movement wasnot carried out efficiently. It appears that the change of date was due to thedisorganisation of the railways. Even on the day of the move, one of the columnswas late, there were numerous breakdowns of mechanical transport, and the totalnumber of vehicles and tanks which appeared are said to have been only half whatwas expected.The Finnish Frontier.21. Reports indicate a certain increase in military activity on the Finnishfrontier. Five divisions are reported to be on the Carelian Isthmus comparedwith the peace-time three, and three divisions on the Murmansk railway comparedwith the peace-time two. Six out of eight of these divisions are at their peace-time stations, and the increase of force can be accounted for by the factthat three of the regular divisions in tlhose stations are believed to be able to throw off reserve divisions on mobilisation.There has also been a report of intense activity on fortification work onthe extreme north of the Finnish frontier during September.Soviet moves in Lithuania&apos;.22. Reports on the course of the Soviet-Lithuanian technical conversationsstate that the Soviet is going to erect fortifications along the German-Lithuanianfrontier from the sea to the R. Niemen and thence along the Niemen to the newSoviet frontier. Press reports state that Soviet garrisons are to be established at Kelem-Vilkaviskis and Kaisiadorys, and aerodromes at Palanga andRadivilisilis are confirmed.The Caucasus and Chinese Turkestan.23. Reports on the situation in the Caucasus indicate no unusual military activity.The arrival of small bodies of additional Soviet troops in Chinese Turkestanis reported from three different sources, one of which states that they are the advanced detachments of important forces.
? ; -Efficiency of the Russian Army. : i:. [-T &apos;v;&apos;; ;V24. The efficiency and equipment of the Red Army are still the subject of criticism. In particular the Germans appear to have been disillusioned by olosercontact with their new friends. On the other hand eye-witnesses have been definitely impressed by the numbers arid efficiency of the Soviet tanks.Baltic States.Memel.25. It is reported that the construction of fortifications at Memel has been entirely suspended and that coast defence batteries, already sited, have beendismantled and the guns moved elsewhere. This report may be connected withrecent press statements that Memel territory is likely to be handed over toLithuania in the near future.Lithuania.26. It appears that Lithuanian troops have not yet occupied Vjlna. this may be due to disorders in the town. Reports, some of which originated fromGermany, have stated that the Russians are denuding Vilna of machinery andmaterial and that there is widespread distress among the population. There is,further, a possibility of resistance to the Lithuanian advance by Polish elements.Finland.27. His Majesty&apos;s representative has been officially informed that all theforeign press reports of the Soviet demands on Finland were untrue.&apos; Finlandappears to have succeeded in completing her military preparations by the21st October, when the negotiations in Moscow were to begin again. Mobilisationproceeded smoothly.Sweden.28. Although press reports on the subject have been exaggerated, some measure of mobilisation appears to have been undertaken. It is reported thatsome units mobilising in the sparsely populated northern districts have been movedacross the frontier into Finnish territory, where more accommodation is available.This would indicate a closer agreement between the Swedish and Finnish General Staffs than has been officially admitted.Hungary.29. Demobilisation has now been in progress for some weeks and the hungarian Government is reported to intend the gradual demobilisation of alltroops in excess of the normal classes.The Russians are stated to have closed the frontier, a measure by no meansunwelcome to the Hungarians, since it gives them an opportunity of making the closure bilateral without offending the Soviet and of controlling the influx ofRed propaganda into Ruthenia.Moreover, suspicion of Soviet intentions has led the Hungarian Governmentto decide on the fortification of the Ruthenian frontier. In order not to makethe measure appear too obviously directed against Russia, it has been decidedalso to construct fortifications on the Transylvanian, i.e., Roumanian, frontier inRuthenia. The defences against Russia are reported to be three lines, of whichthe last.is to be the River Tisza, thus affording great depth to the defences, asthe Tisza lies inside what has always been Hungarian territory.Italy.30. Military activity in Italy appears to have diminished considerably. Assnow can shortly be expected to rule but active operations on a large scale alongmost of Italy&apos;s land frontiers, there are valid reasons for gradually reducingthe number of men under arms. Watchfulness on the Franco-Italian frontierhas decreased, and some formations on both the French and Yugoslav, frontiersare reported to be returning to their normal peace stations.
In Libya the Italian authorities are controlling the consumption of foodstuffs and petrol. The press is warning the population against the evils of hoarding.Natives of the Libyan Sahara are evincing a certain uneasiness, and it is reportedthat some have tried to move into French territory. An unconfirmed reportstated that a serious mutiny involving casualties had occurred recently in a nativeinfantry unit at Bardia. Apart from the relief of reservists, there are no indications of the decrease in the Libyan garrison which had been rumoured.The total strength of the Albanian garrison appears to have risen above70,000; but information is lacking on which any more reliable estimate could bebased.   The formations in the country nevertheless remain, apparently, below,their full war establishment.In Italian East Africa preparations were made towards the end ofSeptember for Italian troops to begin active operations again against the rebelsin the Jimma and Ancober areas, as was expected with the advent of the dryseason in October. A.reliable report now indicates that an influential rebel leaderin the Ancober area may be obliged to submit in the near future, owing to shortage of arms and ammunition. In that event, the rebel opposition in theAncober area is likely to collapse.British Garrison in Egypt.31. One field company, Sappers and Miners, and certain medical andtransport units have arrived, in Egypt from India. These are to be included inthe garrison of Egypt. They are all additional to India&apos;s External defence troops. Further ancillary units are due to leave India for Egypt in the courseof the next few days.Far East.32. It is established that the Japanese have withdrawn in the YangtzeValley to positions occupied prior to their abortive Changsha offensive. FurtherJapanese reinforcements for central China have arrived during the past week;reports indicate that some of these troops have been drawn from south China,whilst others are said to have come from Manchuria. There are indications thatthe Japanese may intensify their air attacks against Chinese communications insouth-west China, Their object would be to interrupt the flow of imports intoChina through harbours on the south China coast, which the Japanese navalblockade has failed to close, and through French Indo-China. It is doubtful,however, whether this can be achieved by air action alone, and for this reason it ispossible that Japanese troops may land in the Pakhoi area.There has been no improvement in the situation at Tientsin, and anti-British agitation continues at Peking. Chinese terrorists, connected with theJapanese-sponsored regime, have been responsible for a fresh outbreak of violence,at Shanghai, particularly in the British western defence sector. Lawlessness inthe western district is placing an increasing strain on the British garrison, andis probably part of a plan to compel the withdrawal of British troops from thearea.AIR SITUATION.German Air Force.Operations over the North Sea.33. Apart from reconnaissance, enemy action over the North Sea has been confined to the unsuccessful attack of East Coast convoys on the 21st and the22nd October.34. Eleven German aircraft are confirmed as destroyed in the raids onthe Fleet in the Firth of Forth and Scapa Flow on the 16th and 17th october and against the convoys on the 21st and 22nd October. Nine were brought downby fighters and two by A.A. fire. In addition to these, others are known tohave been damaged by gun fire, some of them were probably forced down before reaching Germany. In this connection, the Air Attache at The Haguehas been, reliably informed that only seven out of fourteen aircraft that took part in the raid on the 17th October returned to their bases, four having come
down in the North Sea. This is three more than we had claimed as havingdestroyed.35. In all four raids, the German aircraft operated in loose formations oftwos and threes. Under these conditions, the efficacy of the eight-gun fighter and the ineffectiveness of the German bomber defensive armament weredemonstrated, only two of our aircraft suffering slight damage. On each occasion the German formations consisted of flights from different units. This suggeststhat the raids may have been of an experimental nature and to give experience to future leaders.Disposition of Air Force Units.36. There have been no important changes in the disposition of the german air Force during the past week, and the long-range bomber force remains evenlydispersed throughout Western Germany. In view of the facilities for operating from advanced aerodromes it is doubtful whether any major redistribution wouldtake place as a preliminary to large-scale operations. As an example, at least one of the aircraft which took part in the raid against Rosyth come from Erfurtin Southern Germany. The unit had refuelled at an advanced landing ground&apos;in North-West Germany..37. The only other types of aircraft which might provide an indication offorthcoming operations are the long-range fighter units and the reconnaissanceunits. The main concentration of long-range fighters is now in the Cologne area,whilst reconnaissance aircraft have been located north of the Ruhr. Thisdistribution is more consistent with operations across the Low Countries than with operations over France.German Air Force Operations dver France.38. During the week German air forces carried out a number of reconnais-sance flights, including flights over the line Besancon-Montbard-Chaumont,over Neufchateau, Frouard and Romilly, along the Franco-Belgium Frontierfrom Dunkirk to Mezieres, and over the country west of Dijon. From theseflights and others which the German Air Force has made sines the outbreak ofhostilities, the French infer that the German object has been to obtain informa-tion not so much of troop movements, as of possible bombing targets, especiallyindustrial objectives in the districts of Valenciennes, Lower Seine, Creusot.and Lyons, and Air Force depots at Romilly and Chateaudun.Royal Air Force Operations.Fighter Operations.&apos;39. Fighter patrols were despatched to investigate doubtful enemy plotsoff the East Coast on the 20th, 23rd, 24th and 25th October.On the morning of the 21st October, twelve Spitfires engaged six enemy aircraft near the Southbound convoy off Flamborough Head; two enemy aircraft were probably destroyed in the engagement. In the afternoon of the same day,four Spitfires and three Hurricanes engaged two formations of nine and twelveenemy aircraft which were attacking the Northbound and Southbound Convoys,then passing each other off Spurn Head. Four enemy aircraft were certainlydestroyed and probably one other. On the 22nd October a flight of No. 603Squadron, patrolling over the convoy off St. Abbs Head, shot down a Heinkel III,which fell in the sea. Throughout all the engagements no damage was sustained by our aircraft except a few bullet holes in three fighters.Operations of Bomber A aircraft.w k*^   ^0 ma&apos;&apos;0r 0Perat*ons were undertaken by our bomber forces during theOn the night of the 24th-25th October four Whitley aircraft operating frommis country carried out a night flight over the Berlin area, Magdeburg and hamburg, during which leaflets were dropped. All aircraft landed safely attheir aerodrome of departure. A single aircraft reconnaissance of the Hamburg-Bremen area was also made on the same night. A striking force has been heldready to attack units of the German Fleet in the North Sea.
Atr Component of the Expeditionary fore,  .41. Operations by the Air Component of the Expeditionary Force were&apos;limited to local flying and photographic sorties.Operations of Coastal Command Aircraft,42. Routine patrols and convoy escorts have been maintained throughoutthe week with negligible interference from the weather. Ill addition, searches,reconnaissances and anti-submarine patrols have been intensified, particularly innorthern waters and in connection with tlhe search for the United States steamshipCity of Flint.A number of merchant ships have been reported and four submarines sighted.Three of these were attacked. ^Air escort was provided on forty-four occasions to convoys in the north sea, English Channel and Western Approaches.French Air Forea. -&quot;Organisation. -43. Two more bomber groups, making four in all, have now been withdrawnfrom first-line for re-equipment, with modern aircraft. Two groups, however,equipped with Amiot 143 aircraft have joined tlhe 1st Air Army (North East.France) from North Africa. The 1st Air Army has also been reinforced by 4fighter group from the 3rd Air Army. Approximately 85 per cent, of theMetropolitan Air Force is now in position against Germany.Tne present operational strength of the 1st Air Army is about 1,167 aircraft of all types; that of the 3rd Air Army 177 aircraft.44. It is anticipated that within a short time two-fifths (about 100 aircraft)of the army co-operation units will have been withdrawn into general reserve.These aircraft are of old types and have been found unequal to the task of operating against modern German aircraft; and the French are determined to preserve the trained crews until they can be re-equipped with modern material.Air Operations.45. There has been comparatively little French air activity during the weekowing to bad weather, but some useful reconnaissance flights were made, whichat times encountered strong A.A. fire.
