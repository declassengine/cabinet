THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT      - M---   27TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SEC &apos;BJL&amp;COPY HO.WAR     C A B I H B T.CHIEFS OF STAFF CO&amp;CTTTEE.VISIT OF DOMINION MINISTERS.REVIEW OF THE STRATEGIC SITUATION.Introduction.1.        Germany started with an initial advantage in readiness for war in general.     She was superior in land and air forces, the Allies having superiority at sea.We were compelled for political reasons in fulfilment ofour pledges to Poland to accept the challenge of war withthe Allied re-armament programme still far from complete.2.        Poland suffered complete military defeat very shortly after hostilities had broken out, and nothing which the Allies could do on the Western Front would havesaved her.     If we had attempted to undertake some formof offensive on land or in the air we might havejeopardised our chance of ultimate victory.THE PRESENT SITPATIOH.3.        The German superiority on land and in the sircontinues at the present time.     In the air she possess &quot;anumerical superiority of roughly two to one cea -ared wiiRthat of the Allies.

4*        The only sphere in which we can take the offensiveis in that of economic pressure.     Using our superiority at sea, in combination with diplomatic and financial action,we are already exercising economic pressure on Germany.This  form of warfare, however, takes considerable timeto produce its effect.    Germany started well prepared tomeet it, and we cannot rely on the exhaustion of her stocks in a short time, particularly if she does not undertakelarge-scale offensive operations..   Russian economic co-operation may further a low up the effects of our economic pressure.5.        Owing to our numerical inferiority in the air,Germany has the initiative in that element..    So far as enemy action permits, we must conserve and develop our airresources until the gap between our respective strengthsis narrowed.   In particular, we should not fritter awayour air striking force on unprofitable objectives in deference to clamour for retaliation or to criticism atinaction.    The same principles must be applied to alliedstrategy on land.6.        We should only abandon this policy if the enemytook some action which seemed to threaten decisive resultsagainst us or the French.     In that event all our resourcesincluding our Air Striking Force, would have to be throwninto the. battle.

THE THEATRES OP WAR.7.        Before dealing with the war effort required, it &apos;will he convenient to review the various theatres of warTHE WAR AT SEA.8.        The German Navy, in relation to its strengthvis-a-vis the British and French Navies, has been pursuing a much more enterprising strategy than in the last, war, andhas been engaged from the outset in attacking our sea communications.     In conjunction with their Air Forces,German action in the West has bo far been directed almostentirely against British Sea Power.9.        A vigorous D-boat offensive has been conducted inthe Western Appreaches, and sporadic submarine attack on trade has also occurred in areas as widely distant asNorth of the Shetlands and Cape St. Vincent.10.      German raiders have commenced operations against our trade in the North and South Atlantic, and there is evidence that the Armoured ships &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and&quot;Deutschland&quot; are both operating in the Atlantic.     Theappearance of these ships on the trade routes constitutes a very serious threat.11.      We have also Buffered losses recently through mines and every thing points to the enemy&apos;s -ninlng campaignbeing intensified.-

18;      The total losses of shipping by all forms of enemy actionup to noon 28th October. 1939* were as follows:-Kol. Tonnage.British 62 220,586*Allied &quot;6 42,059neutral 29 72.82187 555,466^his represents 1.2 per cent, of the total British ocean goingmerchant tonnage and a daily loss of .95 ships.   By comparisonour losses from submarines and mines at the peak of the german submarine offensive for the month of April j 1917, were 210 ships(551,000 tons) at a daily rate of 7 ships.   Since the ctinvoysystem was introduced in the present war we have lost 0.3 per cent,of the total ships convoyed, as against 0.53 per cent, of thetotal ships convoyed in the last year of the 1914-1918 war.13.      Sporadic attacks on our Naval forces and convoys in theNorth Sea by German Air forces have caused only small damage sofar, and have been comparatively costly to the enemy.  Bp to the present the Germans have not attacked in strength.14.      The most serious losses suffered by the Royal Navy havebeen the sinking of H.M. ships &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Royal Oak&quot; by submarine action, but the strategic situation vis a vis germany is unchanged thereby.15.      We are countering the German attacks on our seaborne tradewith all the means at our disposal.16.      With the extension of the Convoy System as more escortsbecome available, and with the development of our full anti-submarine resources, we can confidently expect to get the betterof the submarine menace.     By our latest estimate 14 enemy submarines have probably been destroyed already, a further 13are believed to have been damaged, 6 of these probablyseriously.

17.       To counter the activities of the surface raidersconsiderable re disposition of important units of the AlliedNavies haB been made, to form croups working from thevicinity of the main focal points of trade in the atlantic and Indian Oceans.     The naval forces of the Dominions have -cperated actively in this.IS.       Contraband Control in Nerthern waters is in operation against the enemy&apos;s seaborne supplies.     In the Mediterranean,political, geographical and.technical difficulties have-weakened the efficiency of contraband control, and this problem is being urgently studied, since Russo-german economic collaboration has greatly increased the importanceof cutting off enemy sources of supply in that sea. Ujj to 14thOctober 338,000 tons of contrcbmd had been seized in prize.19.       Italian neutrality.has greatly relieved our anxietiesin the Mediterranean.     German submarines have .not yet at-tempted to commence operations there, and we have little to fear from surface or air attack.     In consequence we have beenable to reduce the strength of the Mediterranean Fleet, andto sail shipping unescorted.20.      Naval operations have not yet extended to the Far East.At some future date however we may have to attempt to exercisecontraband control over imports through Vladivostok.8.1.       The Germans may intensify their naval action against our trade with surface raiders and sfemarines, and combine it with a. concentration of their whole air strength against our naval forces and their bases in home waters as well as our commercial ports and our shipping in the narrow seas andesturaries.       Such an onslaught, particularly if unrestrictedwarfare is adopted, will tax our   resources to theutmost, more especially in respect of naval escorts and fighterdefences..    The longer it is delayed however the strongerdoes our position become.22.      The successful waging of the war at sea and in the airagainst a determined enemy, such as the Germans, striking withall their power at the sea communications on which the BritishEmpire depends for its existence, will call for our maximum effort-5-

993&amp;WESTERN EUROPE. great Britain.85,     Apart from the air action we have Just consideredGermany might attempt to reduce our war effort by attack on other objectives in this country such as the following:--(a)&apos; Our air forces and their maintenance organisation,including our home aircraft industry on which we now rely for 90 per cent, of our war potential.(b) Our industrial resources as a whole withparticular reference to the steel industry.Germany might even endeavour, as a last resort, tobreak the morale of the people by unrestricted attack upon our main centres of population, exploiting to the full theeffect of incendiary and gas bombs.34.      Attacks against these objectives would, however, haveto penetrate into our defensive system, whereas attack at sea and on our ports might to some extent evade it.     Forthis reason combined attack by German naval and airforces against our sea communications, including merchantshipping, ports and bases, may prove to be the most dangerous threat.     V/e are continually studying this problem in order to Improve the measures we can take to meet it.France.86.      The Germans have the strategic advantage in the Weston land, since they are numerically superior to the Alliesand for defence have only to consider their common frontierwith France (150 miles).    They know that the Allies are extremely unlikely to infringe the neutrality of the low countries or Switzerland.26*      The Allies, on the other hand, may have to repelattack at any point from the North Sea to the Mediterranean(800 miles).&apos;    The Germans may consider a frontal attackon the Magi not Line impracticable, and attempt therefore -to

outflank it through the Low Countries and/or Switzerland.       -In the air Germany can direct a very heavy scale of attack in support of a land invasion of Prance,    She can alsoseriously threaten French war industry from the air.2%      The great disparity^ between the French land and air^strehgth and that of the Germans - a disparity which may wellincrease as time goes on * makes it imperative that we shouldmake a big. effort in France to ensure the integrity of Frenchsoil.    The defeat of France would be a disaster of thefirst magnitude;MIDDLE EAST AND BALKAN8,North and East Africa.28i      The danger of Italian hostility seems to be recedingbut an Allied reverse might still bring Italy in against us.We must therefore be prepared to fight Italy both in Northand East Afribai     The hostility of italy; involving the closing of the Mediterranean to our through shipping, wouldmean that the war would be initially divided into two main theatres.The Balkans and Turkey.29.      A German and/or Russian drive in South East europe would compel us to go to the support of Turkey in Thrace,and possibly of Greece at Salonika, where we have undertaken,in the Turkish Military Convention, to provide an allied force for defensive purposes.     In the near future we should only be able to make the most limited contribution.6 Note.   The estimated number of French and German Divisionsine^evani^8 (French ^A^u^68 include North Africa and&apos;   French. German.Present&quot; 101     132Spring 1940      114     l60NEventually        114    250 minimum.   This is a french estimate and does not inour view take into account the capacity of, German industry,particularly if it is also tomaintain the German Air Arm.

50,      If a German and/or Russian drive were not held inTurkey we might ultimately be compelled to take up a defensiveline   facing north in Syria, or Palestine.Iraq and Iran.31.      Hostilities with Russia would almost certainly lead toa threat to our interests in Iran and Iraq - the Anglo-Persianoilfields and our line of communications from the Persian Gulfto the Mediterranean.     Even if we did not have to take military action against a Russian offensive, we should have to combat   the subversive influences of Russian propaganda, andthis might involve the despatch of troops.Afghanistan   and India.If 32.      We may be faced with a civil disobedience campaign inV India in the near future, possibly supported and financed by\ Russia.Should Russia take action in Afghanistan we may becalled upon for assistance by the Afghan Government, and inany case the resultant disorder on the North-West Frontier and within India itself may be expected to impose a severe strain on the Army in India, perhaps so severe as to necessitatereinforcement from other sources.Conclusions on Middle East and Balkans.33. From the above it is clear that the potential threatsin the Middle East and Balkans are many. We must thereforebuild up a reserve in that area.Far Bast. . a34.      Japan is heavily committed in China, but we must expecther to take every opportunity of exploiting the situation toher own advantage.     The recent stiffening of the attitude ofthe U.S.A., however, may have a salutary effect.

35. .   Our Naval strength at the present stage of re-armament coupled with the Naval dispositions at presentrequired to deal with enemy commerce raiders, and taking into account our losses and possible future losses, wouldmake it difficult quickly to concentrate a Fleet in theFar East in the event of a Japanese threat to Singapore.This situation has always been foreseen and steps havealready been taken to reinforce the garrison of the fortress and enlarge its reserves of supplies and stores,thereby increasing the period for. which it may beexpected to hold out against attack.     Until the Japanese had reduced Singapore and thus made it impracticable forthe British Fleet to operate in the Far East, they couldnot contemplate large scale operations against australia or New Zealand.     In any event such operations wouldinvolve very heavy military commitments which Japan isnot at present in any condition to undertake.36.^      If therefore Japan adopts a policy of aggression against the Allies, this seems most likely to be directed against Allied interests on the mainland, such asShanghai, Hong Kong and ultimately perhaps Indo-China.We feel that the immediate danger to Australia andNew Zealand is remote.

9 p00.    OPR. STRATEGIC POLICY.Immediate Alms0 i37^       Our immediate aims are to provide for our security on the following broad lines:- .^(a) V/e must defeat the attack on our sea communications,,(b) V.fe must counter the German air threat so asto ensure that it does not dominate strategyin the Y/est.     &quot;e can only do this effectivelyby building up our fighter strength and air defences, and by developing a striking forcecapable of equivalent retaliation.(c) Prance must not be defeated on land, even thougfcher fortifications should be outflanked by an advance through the Low Countries orSwitzerland.     This requires large land forces as well as air forces.(d) Vie must safeguard our interests in the middle east and India against the threat ofGerman and/or Russian aggression by building up a Middle Bast reserve of land and airforces.(e) In the Far East we must maintain thesecurity of Singapore.War effort required.36.        In order to achieve the above we must redress the unfavourable balance of our own comparative strengths.This must take time and will require the maximum possibleco-ordinated war effort from all parts of the BritishCommonwealth of nations.Sa        As a start we have provisionally undertaken thefollowing production programme:-(a) The Naval \7ar Building Programme designed&apos; \to exploit fully the warship buildingcapacity of the Empire.     512 warships arenow building or immediately projected inthe United Kingdom alone, apart from over500 which are being reconstructed orconverted, and ranging from capital ships to auxiliary small craft.(b) A military production programme based on50 divisions, plus a 10% margin as a reserve,i.e. a total of 55 divisions.We hone thci the Dominions will do their utmost towards contributing &apos;jo this total.

(c) The aircraft production programme which aimsat a total output from all sources of2,550 per month.(d) Mercantile Marine Building Programme of1,100,000 tons gross per annum to replaceinevitable war losses, and increasing demands for tonnage.Some indication of the colossal expenditure these programmes will involve may be drawn from the fact thatthe current annual budget fcr defence purposes amounts to 1,250 million.     This includes a vote of credit of  500million which may well be increased.40.        The fulfilment of these programmes will only bepossible by the economical use of our man power.     It isnecessary to maintain a proper balance in the allocation ofman power to production, to the fighting forces, and tothe export trade.     Recruiting is also being carefullyregulatod to keep pace with the production of equipment.1*GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.41.        We cannot count on an early collapse of Germanythrough internal dissension or through shortage of food orlacx of raw materials.     We must therefore aim at developingour resources until we can exert effective pressure on heron land and in the air as well as at sea.     It is quite clear that some time must elapse before we can seize theinitiative and in the meanwhile the international politicalsituation may well change.     Nevertheless neutrals will be influenced mainly by the strength and determination wedisplay.42. The Allied strength at sea should ensure not only that the German&apos; attack on our seaborne trade and sea communications will eventually be overcome but also that themaximumpossible interruption of the enemy,s overseassupplies will be achieved.

43.        On land and in the air   our strength must be developed in two separate theatres - in the West and in theMiddle East.     Y/ith adequate forces in these two maintheatres we should be able to secure our essential interestsagainst any development which we can at present foresee, andto exploit any sign of cracking on the part of Germany.?aphical reasons, having regard to the possibilityof Italy being^hostile, Australia, Hew Zealand, the Unionof South Africa andindia are best placed to co-operate inthe initial stages in thXprovision and maintenance of forces in the Middle East and Afjyaca, while Canada directsher resources to the weste(Signed)       C.L.N.

TABLES   III.DOMINION AIR EFFORT.1.       The major air effort of Canada, Australia and New Zealand is the Empire Air Training Scheme,whioh cannot conveniently be indicated in tabular form.     The object of the scheme is to ensure a constant flow of pilots to this oountry, where the first call on the Dominion personnel would naturally be for such air force units as the several Dominions might be prepared to provi.de and maintain.     Inorder to be able to exert their full effort on the scheme itself the Dominions have been foroed to limit their direct initial contribution to the overseas theatre.The scheme provides for elementary training in all the Dominions and advanced training in Canadafor both Dominion and United Kingdom personnel.2.
