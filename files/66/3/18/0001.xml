The Conclusionsof this Committee came before the War Cnbinet3&apos;, and, after,a further reference to the Chiefs of Staff Committee andthe War Cabinet , a uemoiiJidom was drawn up for communication to the French.     a copy is attached as Annex I.2.        This Memorandum was despatched to Prance by the hand ofAir Vice-Marshal Jvill with instructions to communicate itpersonally to General Garaelin, and to elaborate and explain any points on which further information was required.In accordance with these instructions, Air Vice-Liarshtl-ivill had a full discussion with General Gamelin and GeneralVuillemin on the 24th October:   and on the following day a foncalexpression of the views of the French High Command was received in the form of a letter from General Gamelin to Air Vice-tiershal3*111 (Annex II).x V.k.(39) 47th Conclusions, kinute 4./&quot;   W.li.(39) 5bth Conclusions, Minute 5.-1-TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.

Ml3*        It will be observed from this letter that general gamelin does not agree in certain essentials, with theproposals put forward in our Memorandum.     On the contraryhe is of opinion that -(a) In the event of a German Invasion of Belgium,more satisfactory results would be gained byattacking the German columns, railway lines,and aerodromes rather than by directing theheavy bombers against the Buhr.(b) Air attack on the Ruhr would not materiallydelay the progress of the invading forces;and(c) It would in any event be advisable to postponeany such attack until next Spring, eventhough the result of such postponement were a total or partial occupation of Belgium bythe Germans.4.        It is clearly of the highest importance that thisdivergence of opinion should be reconciled, in order thatdetailed plans may be concerted with the French as to theaction which our respective air forces should immediatelytake if the Germans were to advance into Belgium.    unless this is done, dangerous delays may ensue, and goldenopportunities may be lost0    We have therefore thought it right to re-examine our Memorandum in the light of theviews expressed by General Gamelin, with a view to afurther approach to the French on the whole subject.5.        It has been specifically decided by the War Cabinet(see Anneal, paragraph 2(b)) and agreed by the French high command (see Annex II, paragraph 3 (i)) as one of theprinciples that should govern the employment of our airforces in the immediate future, that &quot;we must not shrinkfrom using all that we have got if enemy action against either

Prance or ourselves looks like being decisive.    Inthat event ov.r striking force must be employed atall costs, in the manner that holds out the best hopeof obtaining decisive results against Germany&quot;.6V      Accordingly, the first point for decision is-whether a German invasion of Belgium this winterwould or would not put her into a position, which,once consolidated, would enable her to bring decisivepressure on England or France.     The French HighCemmand hold the view (see Annex II, paragraph 7)that, even if Belgium were &quot;invaded totally orpartially&quot; we would be well advised to play for time.    We ourselves hold a contrary view for thefollowing reasons:-(a) If tbe Germans established themselves in belgium they would be enabled -o bring a heavierscale of air attack to bear on Great Britain, andon our naval forces, and shipping, in the HorthSea Emfi the Channel.     The scope of that attackcould be extended to our Southern and Western ports,and even to the western Approaches to the Channel.The latter would be of particular importance since it might well be very difficult to use the Port ofLondon.(b) -Ihe enemy would be able to escort hisbombers over a wider area of England and the north sea, and possibly even establish such a degree of

air superiority, as might make an invasion ofEngland a less improbable contingency.(c) The Germans would gain depth in front ofthe Ruhr, and thus greatly increase the power ofthe defence of that area.(d) The possession of the Belgian coastwould gravely complicate our naval problem..7. On the other hand there are great advantages to be gained if the Franco-british forces could move forward, and occupy the lineAntwerp-Hamur, which is very much shorter thanthe line on the Franco-Belgian frontier, andwould release about 20 divisions to reserve.-In exceptionally favourable circumstances, we might even be able to reinforce the Belgianson the Meuse.     In either case it is important to save as large a part of Belgium as possible and thus keep back the German air bases, whilecorrespondingly advancing our own.     The french commander-in-Chief has made a definite plan forthese operations but its execution will depend upon time and space.8. If the force of these arguments beaccepted, it follows that, in accordance with theprinciple quoted in paragraph 5, we must, in theevent of an invasion of Belgium employ our air striking Force in the manner that holds out thebest hope of obtaining decisive results.    How thenshould this be done?

9.        Our Air Striking Force IB partly equipped withmedium bombers of shorter range, which are suitable for undertaking operations against the enemy&apos;s Army, includingcommunications and installations in its immediate rear.This part of the Striking Force suitable, therefore, for undertaking that direct action against the advancing german army, which is advocated by General Gamelin, and contemplated in our Memorandum (See Annex I para S (iii).It would be a grave error to neglect any opportunityof inflicting loss on the German Army in the course of itsadvance and of preventing it from establishing itself on the franco-Belgian Frontier.     Pre-arranged plans exist forsuch action, and authority has already been given by tbeWar Cabinet to the Chiefs of Staff to put these plans intoforce immediately certain information is received of a2German advance into either Holland, Belgium, or Luxembourg.Thus there is no divergence of opinion between ourselves andthe French as to the employment of this part of the striking force.10.      An important proportion of the Air Striking Force isequipped with heavy bombers of long range and great strikingpower designed primarily for attacking military objectives in the enemy &quot;s country which are vital to the continuance ofhis war effort.     To employ these squadrons on objectives inthe forward areas of the land battle (especially in thecircumstances engage) *wuld be grossly uneconomical *     Itis for this reason that we have recommended (see Annex II,para. 3. (iii) that this portion of our Air Striking force should &quot;attack the Buhr as our first and chief objective&quot;.The plan which now exists for this attack entails the systematic ^sii rcticrr of a number of vital industrial and transportation targets wi^ ch, if successful, should not onlys  W.M.(39) 46th Conclusions, Minute 7.-5-

usbring industry in the KUHR practically to a standstill, but would also cause great confusion and dislocation in a very important sector of the lines of communication of the enemyarmies invading BELGIUM.     In our view, Buch action would be effective in dislocating enemy operations in BELGIUM, thoughthe effect would not be immediate.11-      The Erench High Command hold the view that it wouldbe unwise to do so this winter, whatever the provocation.They consider that it would be better to plan for time until next spring.12.      After a full consideration of these arguments, weadhere to our original conception for the following reasonss-(a) The Ruhr is the outstanding economic objective in Germany3 and its successful dislocation and evenpartial destruction would have a most important effecton Germany&apos;s capacity to continue war.     Many of theobji-otives in the plan are relatively remote from oeuireBof populations and the plan would probably involve no more loss of civil life than attack on railway centres and other narrowly military objectives. &apos;   Moreover,many of the civilians killed would be German munition workers instead of Belgian peasants, of whom many mustlose their lives in our operations against the GermanArmief. in Belgium.(b) The most favourable moment militarily forattacking these objectives in the Ruhr would bethe moment at which the German Army started itsadvance, since it would not have had time toestablish air defence in depth and would be particularly susceptible to the confusion anddislocation which our attack would cause inits rearward comnrunications.

(c) Pyscho logically, the moment would be signally opportune.The bombing of objectives in the Buhr would, notonly be directly related to the battle on land,but would also be justified as a retaliation fora completely unwarranted violation of the neutrality of a small Nation.    If the Buhrwere not bombed at that particular moment, soreasonable a justification might never recur.(d) In war, the effect of separate operations iBgreatly increased if they are executedsimultaneously.     Consequently our attack on theBuhr should be timed to synchronise with theland battle.13,     In the light of the above arguments we invite theWar Cabinet to reconsider one of their previous decisions.They have laid it down (see Annex I, para. 2 (d), and para.3 (iii)), that we should not initiate air action likely to cause civilian casualties.    Accordingly, an essentialpre-requisite to any attack on the Buhr is that the germans should either have -(a) undertaken intensive and indiscriminate air action against France or ourselves;   or alternatively.(b) have caused considerable civilian casualties in the process of violating Belgium.

HI14*       German action, tinder (a) would be easily andquickly established; and our air force could undertakeimmediate retaliation.   German action under (b) on theother hand, could not, it is thought, be definitely established in sui-icient time to enable the air force to seize what must in any event be a fleetingopportunity.   In the first place. It -would be verydifficult to obtain definite evidence from the confusionof the battle front, in the second place it would benecessary to get a Jar Cabinet decision). and in thethird place it would be necessary to get -the agreementof the French.   All these processes will take time, andthis is the one thing that we cannot afford.15.       We hold the view that to bomb the Ruhr inthe circumstances, under consideration is fully justified by the action which the german Air Force took in Poland;when they attacked factories, power stations, railway communications etc, etc   The only reason that werefrained at that time from taking similar actionagainst comparable German objectives was that ofmilitary expediency.   We submit moreover that anentirely unjustifiable attack by Germany on a smallState whose neutrality they are pledged to upholdwould be sufficient justification for our attacking

Hthe Ruhr9 irrespective of whether irrefutable evidencewere available of their having caused civilian casualities.16.      In these circumstances we ask for discretion to bombspecif led military objectives in the Ruhr immediatelyBelguim is invaded, without further reference to the WarCa&amp;ine&amp;e17o      la this Memorandum we have confined our attention tothe invasion of Belgium and its results.    If Germany wereto invade Holland simultaneously with Belgium, the problem is the same though the arguments are intensified.IB.       If Holland only was invaded but the Belgians calledus in to their (I,e. Belgium&apos;s) assistance, our policy wouiaagain he the same.19.      If, however, Holland was invaded anc. Belgium did notcall for assistance, separate issues would be raised and weare examining this problem as a matter of urgency.    Muchwin depend on the exact circumstances and particularly onthe attitude of the Butch themselves.20o     Finally, we have to report that during the visit ofthe Chief of the Air staff and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral staff to Paris on the 9th November, 1939, general gamelin was again consulted on the question of Air Policy.He refused to be shaken from his previous views as summarised in paragraph 3 above:   Indeed he reaffirmed themwith emphasis.Perhaps the most important consideration in the minds of the French High Command is that attack on the Ruhr wouldinvolve retaliation on French Industry, and particularly ontheir aircraft factories, which they want to avoid at all costs,for the time being.For this reason it is, in our view, important that after a decision by the War Cabinet this vital question should hedisctSBed at a meeting of the Supreme War Council.-9-

21a-     To sum up&apos;:-(a) He consider that a German invasion of Belgiumwould constitute action w.i.ch &quot;looks like beingdecisive&quot;, and therefore that we ghmiiri &quot;notshrink from using all that we have got&quot; to defeat it.(b) He therefore recommend that, in the event of this contingency:-(i) Immediate action should be taken by thoseportions of the French and British airForces which are particularly suitable forthe purpose, to attack the advancing german army, in accordance with pre-arranged plans.(ii)The remainder of our bombers should immediately attack specified military objectives in the fiuhr.(c) Ue ask that we should be authorised by the BarCabinet to take action under recommendation (b)(ii)above immediately definite information is received of the enemy&apos;s entry into Belgium in the sane way as we are already authorised to take action on(b)(i).(d) tie consider that the above policy should apply equally if Holland only is invaded but the Belgianscall us in to their (i. e. Belgium,s) assistance,. Weare considering as a separate issue what our policy should be if Holland only is invaded and Belgiumdoes not call for help.(e) As General Gamelin, who is in Supreme Command both ofthe French Army and of the British ExpeditionaryForce, holds different views from those summarised above, ws recommend that if our policy is approvedby the War Cabinet, the whole question should bediscussed at a meeting of the Supreme War council as scon as this can be arranged.(Signed) C.L.N* NE3ALL.Rooir &quot;        DUDLEY POUND.November. 1939c &quot;        EDMTJHD IBONHUDE.-10-

AHHEX  I.   &apos;1AR CABIHgr.AIR pcltcy.Memorandum -for gcmramlcationto the French.The British Chiefs of Staff have recentlyexamined the principles -ahich, in the face of thesituation tshich now confronts the Allies, should govern the employment of the British bomber force,and the manner in which these principles should beput into effect in various alternative situations.2. On the question of principle, the conclusions which they have reached and which have been generally approved by the War Cabinet, are as follows:-(a) The Allied inferiority vis-a-vis Germany in existing air strengths.     Prom this it follows that for the present the initiativeis with Germany:   our action must beconditioned by her action.It also follows that, so far as enemy action permits, we should conserve and develop our resources until the gap innumerical strength is narrowed.     Inparticular, we should not fritter away ourstriking force on unprofitable objectives in deference to public clamour for-retaliation or public criticism at inaction.(b) On the other hand, we must not shrink from using all that we have got if enemy actionagainst either Prance or ourselves lookslike being decisive.     In that event, ourstriking force must be employed at all costs In the manner that holds out the best hope of obtaining decisive results againstGermany.(c) Germany*s weakest spot is the ruhr, the heart of which is about the sise of greater london, and in which is concentratedapproximately &amp;0% of Germany&apos; s vital industry.It contains, ss^rsover, a population which

might be expected to crack underintensive air attack.   Such attacksY/ould involve a heavy casualty rollamong civilians, including women andchildren.(d) We should not be the first to &quot;take thegloves off&quot;.   From this it follows that until and unlesi Germany, by killinglarge nurabers of civilians, either byIndiscriminate air attack on France orGreat Britain, or in the course of a violation of Belgium, gives the necessaryjustification, there could be no questionof attacking *he Ruhr, or anything otherthan strictly military objectives.3-      The application of tha above principles to various alternative hypotheses may bo illustrated as IoIIotts.-(i) If tha enemy confines his attack, either on the French or ourselves, to strictly military objectives, we should reply bystrictly limited attacks on correspondingGerman objectives, i.e. we should continueour present bombardment policy.(ii) If the enemy attacks convoys or even ourEast Coast ports indecisively, i.e. if theyare not doing vital damage - we should still not do anything to invite retaliationwhich might do us vital damage.(iii) If the Germans should either undertakeintensive and indiscriminate air actionagainst France or ourselves, or alternatively,if they were to attack France through belgium and cause considerable civilian casualties in the process of violating the latter, itwould be a matter for immediate decision bythe British War Cabinet whether we shouldattack the Ruhr as our first and chiefobjective.   In the latter alternativethis attack would be combined with pctionagainst any favourable military targetspresented by the advance of the German forcer-.4.        The British Chiefs cf Staff would be glad to b-?informed whether the French High Command are in agreementwith the views erpresr-ad in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.23Lst October, 1939 -

Copy of a letter dated   25th October. 1939*from general gamelin to Air Vice Marshal Evlll.x       x   - .Follovring our meeting of 24th Octolier, -sould yoube good enough to accept as follows the point of viewof the French High Command, as General Vuillemin and my-self have already explained it to you, in relation to thequestions set forth in the Memorandum rxmexed to the. letterfrota Air Chief Marshal Newall dated 23rd October, 1939.The French High Command are in agreement vith youas regards the principles expounded in paragraph 2 of theMemorandum.     Eo?:ever, it appears to them very difficultto forecast the moral effect on Germany as the result ofa heavy bombardment of the Ruhr.     (See footnote.)With regard to the application of these principles:(1)   The French High Command ere in full agreementwith the conclusions as set forth inparagraphs (a) and (b) of the third paragraph.(2)   They are also of opinion that if the Germanstake the initiative in starting anunrestricted war in the cd.r, we shouldretaliate immediately with ell our Forces,and without any restrictions.NOTE:     It is to be noted that this region is very strongly protected by Anti-Aircraft artillery and fighter aircraft.   &apos;

The French High cenoand are in agrecaanfc withyon that the invasion of Belgium by the Germans would constitute a very serious threat to Great Britainand France, in view of the new air bases which theenemy would find available in that country.The French High Coraaand considersj, nevertheless,that intensive aerial attack on the Suhr, whateverimportance that objective may possess from every point of view, would not materially delay theprogress of the invading forces^Would not the action of the Bombing Squadrons,acting alone or in conjunction with the ground forces, if these are called upon in time by theBelgian Government, bring about much more satisfactory results by attacking the German columns,railway lines, aerodromes?On the other hand, by gaining time, we shall find ourselves in the Spring in a clearly morefavourable position.   Belgium, if invaded totallyor partially, will offer a. battle ground upon whichwe will be able to use, with every chance of success,the powerful air and military weapons which will thenbe at our disposal.Finally, the attack on the Buhr will causeheavy casualties among the civilian population.It will inevitably produce violent retaliation against objectives, some of which, in i?rance, are essentially vulnerable.   This attack mast bedecided upon by our Governments.Consequently, the French High Conmand areof opinion that it will be necessary to prepare two

plans Tor the eaploysent of oar Boshing Forces in theevent of the violation of Belgian neutrality by Germany.One plan, to be put into operation directly by theCosnandj, having in view the attack of strictly military objectives, troops, lines of communications, aerodromes.Another pliin, for the heavy bombardment of theBuhr, the execution of rhich would be subordinate to the decision of our Governments.(Signed)   E. GxHELIN.General Headquarters.
