naval SITUATION.German Attack on Sea-tome Trade.During the week under review only one small British ship has been lost by enemy action. This was the S.S. Carmarthen Coast (961 tons), which was minedoff Seaham Harbour. Two of the crew were killed by the explosion, theremainder were saved.S.S. Brandon (6.668 tons) reported having been missed by a torpedo 129 miles west of the Hebrides on the 4th November. She was not in convoy at the time.With reference to the sinking by submarine of S.S. Clan Chisholm on the17th October off Cape Finnisterre, S.S. Capetown Castle on arrival at Capetownreported having picked up a lifeboat with nineteen Lascars on the 21st October.It is believed that all the crew of the Clan Chisholm are now accounted for.2 In the past week two neutral ships were lost bv mine off the Humber,the Norwegian S.S. Sig (1.342 tons) and Danish S.S. Canada (1L108 tons). Thelatter ship disregarded the instructions she had received. Fourteen of her crew were landed by the Humber lifeboat and the remainder were picked up by theNorwegian S.S. Ringhorn. Since the 21st October ten ships totalling 34.056 tonshave been lost by mine in this area.A Greek vessel. S.S. Nicolaos Embiricos (5,295 tons) was mined off theSotrrn Goodwin light vessel on the 4th November, having disobeyed her routeinstructions.  Her crew were eaved.3. The Greek ship Thrasyconlos (3,693 tons) was sunk on the 30th Octoberby U-boat 240 miles West of Land&apos;s End while on passage from Swansea to new York, but was not included in the previous resume. Six of her crew wererescued by Norwegian S.S. Hatnoy. but twenty-two are unaccounted for. Shewas not in convoy.4. On the 4th November a TJ-Boat stopped the Norwegian motor vesselStoranger (9,223 tons) 107 miles West of Lisbon and asked for diesel oiL but none was provided. The crew of this submarine was reported to have lookedven&apos; emaciated.5. There have been no attacks by aircraft or surface raiders reported during;&apos;the past week, nor has there been any reliable information of the pocket! battleships previously reported on the trade routes. Three British ships reportedj overdue at Freetown in last week&quot;s resume are, however, still unaccounted for,l and the M.V. Tretanion (5.299 tons), which sailed from Table Bat on theI7th October and was due at Freetown on the 1st November, has also not yet arrived. A diagram showing the weekly losses of British shipping since thebeginning of the war is attached as an Annex.Anti-Submarine Operations. h* \-6. The reduction in submarine activity has been reflected in theLsubmarineoperations. Only six attacks have been carried out, four by surface snip, one by submarine and one by aircraft. No definite success has been claimed.7. Three of these attacks took place in the English Channel, one byGreyhound South of Start Point on the 2nd November, two by His Majesty&apos;&quot;sCanadian Ship Assiniboine East of Start Podst during the early hours of the4th November and one by Grenade and Exmouth South of the Lizard on thenwrnini ^ ^ ^ ^vem*&apos;er faring which forty-five depth charges wereIn the southen^part of the North Sea H.M. Submarine Sealion attacked aU-boat on the 6th November. The weather was bad and the torpedoes missed,worth of Cape Wrath on the 3rd November aircraft bombed a U-boat, but therewas no visible result after the submarine had dived.8. Five bodies of German officers and seamen, wearing escape apparatus,nave been washed up on the Kentish Coast, but the identity of the submarineconcerned has not been established.v 9- At noon, Thursday, the 9th November, one submarine was reported ini ell Sound (Shetlands). The remainder now at sea are believed to be on their way borne. None is reported to be coming out from Germany.
10. The following are the estimated casualties to U-boats up to the6th November: Known sunk   ...     ...     ...     ...... 7Probably sunk............     ___ .      12Probably seriously damaged......     ... 6Probably slightly damaged......      ... 7Convoys.11. Twenty-six convoys, comprising 319 ships, have sailed from, or arrivedat, ports of the United Kingdom during the period under review.No ships have been lost on convoy. Convoys have varied in size from 52 ships to only 5.On an average 17 convoys have been at sea each day, requiring the dailyemployment on this service of one battleship, four cruisers and twenty-onedestroyers, besides escort vessels and trawlers. In addition, the French have5 destroyers or Scouts at sea daily escorting between Gibraltar and western approaches. Armed Merchant Cruisers have been taken into service for oceanescort duties.12. The first outward Norwegian convoy arrived in Norwegian waters onthe 7th November, and the homeward Norwegian convoy left on that day andhas now reached Scottish waters.Defensive Equipment of Merchant Vessels.13. Up to the 31st October, 130 fast liners and 654 other British and dominion merchant vessels had been given a low-angle defensive armament.The majority of the fast liners and approximately 40 per cent, of the remainderhave also a high-angle gun. For ships sailing in East Coast convoys a ma^hi-nogun for anti-aircraft purposes is provided. At least one naval rating is providedfor each ship defensively equipped, but the bulk of the guns&apos; crews are taken from ships&apos; crews. Arrangements are made for special training of guns&apos; crewswhen ships are in harbour.It is intended to arm all ships of 500 tons gross and over, which involves the total provision of 3,600 equipments. In addition, 19 selected vessels havebeen equipped as armed Merchant Cruisers during this period.&apos; 14. The value of defensive armament was demonstrated in the case of theS.S. Stonepool, which was attacked by a U-boat on the 13th October whilst on passage from Mn-FORn Haven to St. Vincent, Cape Verde Isles. The Masterimmediately altered course to put the U-boat astern and brought his gun into action with such effect that the submarine broke off the action 15 minutes later.The Stonepool, though holed, returned safely to harbonr.Home Waters General15. The Home Fleet has been at sea for the greater part of the periodcovering the Scandinavian Convoys and the Northern Patrols.Enemy aircraft attacked the Polish destroyer Blyskawica on the7th november in the Southern portion of the North Sea and fired a torpedo at her, which sheavoided. This is the first case of torpedo attack by enemy aircraft which hasoccurred. The 5th Minesweeping Flotilla off Cromer was unsuccessfully attacked by bombs on the same day. H.M. Submarine Seal was also unsuccessfully attacked by aircraft about this time when returning from patrol. HM. SubmarineUrsula was unsuccessfully attacked by a U-boat.Gales have been experienced over the whole Atlantic Seaboard and have resulted in some casualties. H.M.S. Kelly lost two boats and a man overboard, andstrained her plating to the extent that she is no longer capable Of high speed inrough weather.&quot;City of Flint.&quot;16. The City of Flint, accompanied by a Norwegian Gunboat, anchored offHacgesund on the 3rd November for the purpose, as stated by the officer in chargeof the prize crew, of obtaining medical assistance for one of the ship&apos;s crew. TheNorwegian Authorities interned the prize crew and released the ship, in con-fonnity with their own neutrality regulations and International Law.[20292] b 2
The rule is that &quot; a prize may only be brought into a neutral port on accountof unseaworthiness, stress of weather or want of fuel or provisions, &apos; and a neutralmust therefore release a prize brought into one of its ports under other circum-stances. This rule treats the cargo and ship as one, but in any event a neutralhas no right to interfere with goods consigned to a belligerent. It now appearsthat the City of Flint is to discharge her cargo in Norway.Mining,17. The Dover barrage is being further strengthened. Ten thousand mines have now been laid by the British.The German declared area off the Sound has recently extended so as toencroach into the Swedish buoyed channel, with, it is suggested, the intention offorcing ships to pass the examination service at Kiel. The U.S.S.R. have declared the whole of the Gulf of Kola, in which lies Murmansk, a prohibitedarea.Finland has declared Hango mined, and also an area up to the Russianborder. The Dutch have mined the mouths of the Scheldt and Rhine and the entrance to the Texel.German Merchant Shipping.18. The German Hansa liner Uhenfels (7,603 tons) which, disguised as aDutch ship, had sailed from Lorenzo Marquez in a third attempt to get away, was captured by H.M.S. Herevard on the 5th November, after being intercepted by aircraft, about 300 miles West-South-West of Freetown, whither she was taken with prize crew on board-Economic Warfare.19. Tonnage seized by Contraband Control Authorities in Great Britainthis week is 19,500 tons, of which 11,648 tons are cereals.214 ships have been dealt with, which shows a marked speeding up sincethe total dealt with from the beginning of the war is about 900. No returns areyet available for Contraband Control bases abroad.The Germans are reported to have taken into their ports for examination aLatvian, a Finnish and a Swedish ship (total tonnage 7,600 tons), two of these are bound for the United States.Casualties to Personnel of Merchant Nary and Fishing Fleets.20. Casualties to personnel of the merchant navy and fishing fleets for theperiod the 3rd September to the 31st October are provisionally estimated at307 dead, 79 injured and 11 prisoners out of a total crew of sunken ships ofabout 4,000, giving 8 per cent, killed and 2 per cent, injured. It is not possibleto give casualties amongst neutrals.Additions to His Majesty&apos;s Navy since the Outbreak of War.9221.

MILITARY SITUATION.   ,,Western Front. . .Operations:22. German operations daring the period under review have been limitedto patrols, minor attacks and artillery harassing fire in the Rhine-Mosellesector. The main centres of such activity have been the Warndt Forest,Forbach, the Blees valley and the area to the north of Wissemburg. On theBhine Front the flooded river has been gradually subsiding and the germans have been able to carry out fortification work.German troop movements.23. The eentre&quot;of interest in the &quot;West is the situation on the Dutch and belgian frontiers. Reports have been received of the presence at Duisburg andKrefeld of cavalry forces believed to have been transferred from East Prussia;the arrival of medium and heavy artillery, tanks, engineers and bridging units in the area Duisburg-Rees; the arrival of a heavy artillery unit ana tanks atAachen; and the despatch of considerable quantities of petrol to the dutch frontier and of several train loads of pontoon bridging material to Emmerich.These reports do not necessarily mean that an invasion of Holland or Belgiumis imminent. On the other hand, the numbers of reports received cannot be overlooked and the deduction seems to be that, for some reason or other, military measures have been taken on the frontiers of Holland and Belgium which would facilitate military action against those countries. . &apos;24. Some two hundred heavy guns, believed to be of Czech and Polishorigin, are reported to have been transferred to the area between Koblenzand Pirmasens, and heavy troop movements are said to have taken place recentlyfrom Berlin westwards by rail.Reliefs of Divisions.25. Several divisions, which have been in the front line of the Rhine-Moselle sector since the outbreak of hostilities, seem to have been withdrawn and their areas taken over by fresh divisions.A new measure to ensure secrecy is apparently the allotting of false namesto formations and units. Names are changed weekly. Several corps, divisions and units bearing such false names have already been reported.British Troops.26. The 1st Battalion, the Welsh Guards, left Gibraltar on the8th November for France.Poland.27. The Germans are reported to be erecting barbed-wire defences andconstructing trenches, reinforced by concrete, along the line of the rivers VrsTDXAand San. There are also rumours of clashes between German and Russian troopsin Poland and of the Russians fortifying their own frontier.Soviet Russia.Activities in Latvia and Finland.28. The movements of Soviet troops to their stations in Latvia have been taking place gradually and under cover of the strictest secrecy, and is probablycomplete by now. No further activity has been reported from the Finno-Sovietfrontier with the exception of an unconfirmed report that the Russian forcesopposite the eastern border of Finland have been increased from three to four divisions.Propaganda in Ruthenia.29. The Hungarians are reported to have forced down two Soviet aircraftcarrying propaganda leaflets and flying over Ruthenia-[20292] B 3
Caucasus.30. There has evidently been some troop movement to and from the Trans-Caucasian Military District. This may be due to the relief of Mohammedanunits, many of whom are not considered reliable; but it is impossible as vet to assess whether the district has, on balance, been reinforced or not. A broadcastfrom Erivan, which ordered reservists of the 1913 to 1916 classes resident in the caucasian Republics to report to their units by the 25th October, suggests thatformations in th&quot; Trans-Caucasus District have&apos; been brought up to war strength,and that possibly some reserve formations are to be mobilised. A subsequentofficial denial of Jie authenticity of this broadcast need not necessarily carryconviction.The Red Army in Poland.31. The following is a summary of the report of a Polish reserve officer whosucceeded in escaping to Ronmania: &quot; The average tactical unit of the Red Army appeared to be a columnconsisting of: (a) Fifty to sixty tanks.(6) Tractors carrying fuel and food for the tanks and their crews,(c) Light lorries carrying soldiers.Behind these came detachments of approximately 460 infantry.There were no light tanks. All the tanks seen were of twelve to fifteen tons weight and appeared to work in sections of three. The infantryhad one light machine gun to fifteen men, and one automatic rifle to everyten men. The discipline and marching of the columns were good, though the casulties among vehicles were unduly high. The clothing of the men wasvery bad. The Russian troops seemed amazed at the freedom of purchase in civil life. Officers ordered vast quantities of food in the restaurants; andhave been known to rip the leather upholstery off motor cars and carry offtyres. Supplies of sugar and flour were requisitioned on a large scale.In a report on the movement of Soviet troops into Estonia the followinginteresting points were brought ont: &quot; The staff work connected with the move was indifferent. The soviet authorities had asked for six train timings over the Estonian railways forthe 18th October, none of which were they ready to use. During the actualmove nobody seemed to have any clear idea of the times at which the columnwould pass various points, and roads were closed over an unnecessarily long period. The standard of march discipline and driving was on the wholesatisfactory, though there was a tendency to bunch at defiles. casualties among vehicles seemed unduly high in the armoured brigade, which was onlymoving an average of fifty miles a day along a fair road. For example,motoring along a road over which a column of two hundred vehicles had passed three hours before, the observer counted seven tanks, five lorries andthree caterpillar tractors in trouble.&quot;Deductions drawn from a comparison of numerous reports on the efficiency of the Red Army in Poland are as follows: The first armoured units to enter the country made a good impression, but therest of the army was of poor quality. Officers appeared to lack intelligence andto be poorly educated; the men were generally well behaved, but seemed apatheticand of poor physique. All were delighted at the opportunities for purchasingfreely and paid cash for everything. The equipment of the first line units was good; that of the second line very poor. Clothing, even in first line units, wasbad, and boots were insufficient and of poor quality!The Soviet tanks seemed powerful and very numerous, but they had a disproportionate number of breakdowns.Jfa! general impression gained regarding petrol supply was that the reservescarried by each column allowed for a considerable radius of action, but that, oncetins was expended, there were apt to be great delavs before further supplies were brought up. KP
32. There is still no confirmation of the precise degree of demobilisationintended in the Italian Army, but some reservists continue to be released. Itseems probable that the older (1902 and 1903) classes at least will be whollyreleased both in Italy and overseas. Unless other classes are also discharged, thetotal strength of tbe Italian Army will be about 1,250,000.In Libya the number of colonists that actually arrived was under 12,000instead of the expected 20,000 (see Weekly Resume No. 9, paragraph 30). About10.000 of these are estimated to have landed in Cyrenaica. The total increase inpotential man-power for military duty is calculated at 2,000 only.The Balkans and Turkey.33. The situation on the frontier between Hungary and Rcamania seems likely soon to be restored to normal.In Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey the situation remains unchanged.Bulgaria has not yet announced any measures of demobilisation consequent onthe Turkish decision to reduce the garrison in Thrace from about mid-November.34. The remaining mechanical transport, and ancillary units of the 4thIndian Division were due to arrive in Egypt on the 8th November. With the arrival of these units the 4th Indian Division will be complete on a two-brigadebasis.Far East.Military Operations.35. The military situation in China remains virtually unchanged. Thereare further indications that the Japanese may be contemplating an extensionof military operations in south China to supplement air action against Chinesecommunications.Japanese bombers have been increasingly active; particularly againstChengtu, the capital of Szechwan, and on roads connecting Kwakgsi Provincewith Ikeo-Cheia.British Interests. *38. Anti-British agitation, fostered by the Japanese military forces, shows signs of decreasing in north China; this is probably due to the fa l that funds,hitherto devoted to the purpose, are being withheld. &apos; -The General Officer Commanding, China, has made the following reply tothe Japanese demands made in October for revision of the Shanghai defence scheme: &quot;No withdrawal of British-troops from their present responsibilities in Shanghai can be contemplated until all danger to British lives and property has been removed and circumstances permit a general reconsider a-tion by nations concerned of the defence arrangements for Shanghai.&quot;    )Disturbances in the western district of the British concession at Shanghaicontinue. It appears, however, that the local Japanese authorities are beginning to be anxious about the situation they have produced and it is possible that conditions will not deteriorate further&quot;.United States.Army Reorganisation.37. Recent reports on deficiencies in training and equipment in the UnitedStates Army have led the War Department to recommend various changes, and
the European situation has caused plans to be expedited.. The mainchanges are:  ....A recommendation for the expansion of the United States army from 227,000to its full authorised peace-time strength of 280,000 men. To implement this itis reported that new units for a GJI.Q. reserve, and army and corps troops areto be formed, together with a second cavalry division. AH formations are to commence field training immediately and to receive higher training. Previously,the latter took place in army areas in rotation, once in four years. The RegularAnnv Reserve is also being recruited rapidly, but is still below its maximumstrength of 75,000.Immediate reorganisation of five out of the nine American Army divisionsis to be undertaken.Large orders have been placed for additional equipment, which includestanks, semi-automatic rifles and motor vehicles, many of which will be used fortowing artillery. Although equipment is good and morale excellent, the UnitedStates Army has a lot of leeway to make up before it reaches the standard oftraining of a western European army.Belgian Mission to the United States.3S. A Belgian military mission is reported to have left for the United Stateslast month. It is to purchase aircraft, aerial instruments, anti-aircraft guns andarmv equipment. Its purchases are expected to amount to approximately 1,700,000.AIR SITUATION.German Air Force Actmty.Operations.39. On the Western Front, the German Air Force carried out a number ofreconnaissance flights over the interior of France, and on the 5th and6th November dropped pamphlets at points in the Vosges and in the districtsouth of Saverne. During the day, the 7th November, they also dropped pamphletsin the Paris Region and over Amiens. There have been a number of instances of violation of Belgian and Dutch neutrality by German aircraft, not only ontheir homeward but also on their outward journey. Such violations of Belgiumby German reconnaissance aircraft flying at high altitudes are becoming frequent,and the Belgian Government has protested.German reconnaissance flights over the North Sea were limited for the first half of the past week, largely on account of bad weather, but aircraft were very active during the last two days.Movements.40. No moves of bomber forces have been reported during the past week, andno nerr units have been identified There has been a continuation of activity by german bomber units in the Baltic; this activity includes dive bombing practiceagainst moving targets. A few fighters and army co-operation units are reportedto have moved from the Aachen area northwards to the Oldenburg area, east ofthe Dutch frontier.Preach Air Force.Operations. -41- Bad weather on the Western Front has continued and air activity on both sides has been restricted. Nevertheless, the French Air Force carried outmrnng the early part of the week a number of reconnaissance missions over the. j^Ti[Moselle. Black Forest and Upper Danube areas, and a large number of individual fighter patrols over enemy lines. Leaflets were dropped by the French
in the direction of Matetcs on the 3rd November. On the 6th November therewere three encounters with German aircraft:     f .Four French fighters engaged six enemy fighters, with no result.Nine French fighters and two reconnaissance aircraft were engaged byeight German fighters North-East of Metz, two of the enemy were snot downin French territory and one in German territory. Both the French recon-naissance aircraft were destroyed.One French fighter encountered an unidentified enemy aircraft whichwas shot down south of Fobbach.These actions were originally reported as one engagement between nine Erenchand twenty-seven German aircraft in which, it was claimed, the Erench hadshot, down nine Germans.42. A number of reconnaissance flights were made on tbe day of the7th November over the Moselle and Saar areas, bat no abnormal activity was observed. Enemy AA. guns were active and shell bursts from big-calibre AA.guns were observed as high as 8,000 metres (26,000 feet). That niffht (the 7th-8th)reconnaissance flights were made over the Lahn Valley and the Rhine up toCologne, no road or rail activity being observed (enemy searchlights active, AA.guns limited). On the 8th November, it is reported that the French shot down a German reconnaissance aircraft.Czech Personnel in French Air Force.43. It is possible for foreigners to enter any of the French Fighting Servicesafter serving in the Eoreign Legion, and in August last an apparently considerablenumber of officers and N.C.O.&apos;s of the Czech Air Force joined the Foreign Legion.A number of Czech pilots are now being drafted into fighter squadrons of theFirst Air Army.Re-equipment of Observation Squadrons.44. The re-equipment of French Observation Squadrons in the line hasstarted, and five squadrons, it is officially reported, will have received three aircraft each by about tbe 10th November.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.45. Bomber aircraft in this country and with the Advanced Air striking force in France have carried out no operations over enemy territory during thelast seven days. Fighter squadrons attached to the Advanced Air Striking Forcehave made a total of 105 routine and interception patrols. On the 8th Novembera patrol of two Hurricanes engaged two enemy reconnaissance aircraft at27,000 feet. One of the enemy was snot down and crashed near a French village.On another occasion nine German fighters forced a Hurricane aircraft down inFrance.The &quot; M&quot; Ballots Unit despatched a number of balloons carrying leafletsover Germany on the 4th and 6th November. A total of over 300,000 leaflets were distributed by this means.Royal A ir Force Component with the Expeditionary Force.46. The Army OiMiperation Squadrons have continued to photograph thearea of the British Expeditionary Force.On the 6th November five Blenheim aircraft made long-distance reconnais-sanees over Germany. Four landed in England: one is missing. Their tasksincluded the photographing of the Siegfried Line and reconnaissance of certain areas in North-West Germany as far north as Borkum. No fighter opposition was encountered and their tasks were completed successfully.A similar task was undertaken by five Blenheims on the 7th November; all aircraft, except one which is missing, landed safely in England. They reportedno abnormal enemy activity.
Coastal Command.47. The bad weather round the British Isles duriDg part of the week hasmade conditions difficult. Routine patrols, convoy escorts and searches have not,however, been appreciably curtailed. A large humber of merchant ships havebeen reported. An aircraft attacked a submarine in a position 85 miles .N.W. of Cape Wrath, dropping one bomb beside the conning tower before ithad submerged. Another submarine was sighted 40 miles S.S.W. of Portland,and reported to the Canadian destroyer Assiniboine, which was in the vicinity.Our reconnaissance aircraft have encountered enemy reconnaissance aircraft over the North Sea.on several occasions during the week and a number of engage-ments have taken place. On the 7th November three such engagements were reported. A Hudson chased a Heinkel 60 miles east of Spurn Head, bnt lost itin a rain storm. An indecisive engagement between an An son and a Bonderoccurred 95 miles east of Flamborodgh Head; the enemy, after returning theAnson&apos;s fire, escaped into cloud. Two Ansons 110 miles N.W. of Terschelungfired several bursts at short range at a Heinkel, which appeared to be in difficulties as it dived into cloud.On the 8th a fight took place between an Anson and a Heinkel 44 miles west of Terschelllng, in which the Heinkel crashed in the sea. Photographs were obtained of the wreckage. Another engagement occurred between two Ansonsand two Dorniers 110 miles east of Flamborough Head. One Bonder is believed to have gone down out of control.Fighter Command.48. The investigation by Fighter Command aircraft of doubtful enemy aircraft movements during the week accounted for fifty-six patrols involving180 aircraft.
