(89) 116.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.STATEMENT BY THE FIRST LORD TO THE FRENCH ADMIRALTY.I CIRCULATE the attached statement, which I made to the FrenchAdmiralty during my recent visit to France, for the information of my colleagues in the War Cabinet.W. S. C.THE naval war alone has opened at full intensity. The U-boat attack oncommerce, so nearly fatal in 1917, has been controlled by the Anglo-French anti-submarine craft. We must expect a large increase in German U-boats (andpossibly some will be lent to them by Russia). This need cause no anxiety providedthat all our counter-measures are taken at full speed and on the largest scale.The Admiralty Representatives will explain in detail our large programmes.But the full development of these will not come till late in 1940. In the mean-while, it is indispensable that every anti-submarine craft available should be finished and put in commission.2. There is no doubt that our asdic method is effective and far better than anything known in the last War. It enables two torpedo boats to do what tenwere required for in 1917-18. But this applies only to hunting. For convoys,numbers are still essential. One is only safe when escorted by vessels fitted withasdics. This applies to warships equally with merchant convoys. The defeat ofthe U-boat will be achieved when it is certain that any attack on French or british vessels will be followed by an asdic counter-attack.The British Admiralty is prepared to supply and fit every French anti-submarine craft with asdics. The cost is small and accounts can be regulatedlater on. But any French vessels sent to England for fitting will be immediatelytaken in hand; and also we will arrange for the imparting of the method aflrttraining to be given in each case. It would be more convenient to do this atPortland, the home of the asdics, where all facilities are available. We contem-plate making provision for equipping fifty French vessels if desired.3. But we earnestly hope that the French Marine will multiply their asdicvessels, and will complete with the utmost rapidity all that can enter into actionduring 1940. After this is arranged for, it will be possible six months henceto consider 1941. For the present let us aim at 1940, and especially at the spring and summer. The six large destroyers laid down in 1936 and 193&quot; will[20261]
be urgently needed for ocean convoys before the climax of the U-boat warfareis reached in 1940. There are also fourteen small destroyers laid down in 1939,or now projected, which will play-an invaluable part without making any greatdrain on labour and materials. Total twenty vessels which could be completed during 1940, and which, fitted with asdics by us, would be weapons of high con-sequence in the destruction of the U-boat offensive of 1940. We also venture to mention as most desirable vessels the six sloop minesweepers laid down in1936, and twelve laid down in 1937, and also the sixteen submarine-chasers of theprogramme of 1938. For all of these we offer asdics and every facility. we will fit them as they are ready, as if it were a field operation. We cannot,however, consider these smaller vessels in the same order of importance as thelarge and small destroyers mentioned above.4. It must not be forgotten that defeat of the U-boats carries with it the sovereignty of all the oceans of the world for the Allied Fleets, and the possibilityof powerful neutrals coming to our aid, as well as the drawing of resources fromeven&apos; par&apos; of the French and British Empires, and the maintenance of trade,gathering with it the necessary wealth to continue the War.5. At the British Admiralty we have drawn a sharp line between largevessels which can be finished in 1940. and those of later periods. In particular,we are straining every nerve to finish the King George V and the Prince of Walesbattleships within that year, if possible by the autumn. This is necessary becausethe arrival of the Bismarck on the oceans before these two ships were completedwould be disastrous in the highest degree, as it can neither be caught nor killed,and would therefore range freely throughout the oceans, rupturing all communications. But France has also a vessel of the hfghest importance in theRichelieu, which might be ready in the autunm of 1940 or even earlier, and will certainly be needed if the two new Italian ships should be finished by the datesin 1940*at which they profess to aim. Not to have these three capital ships inaction before the end of 1940 would l)e an error in naval strategy of the gravestcharacter, and might entail not only naval, but diplomatic consequences extremelydisagreeable. It is hoped, therefore, that every effort will be made to complete the Richelieu at the earliest possible date.With regard to later capital ships of the British and French Navies, it wouldbe well to discuss these in April or May next year, when we shall see much more clearly the course and character of the War.6. The British Admiralty now express their gratitude to their Frenchcolleagues and comrades for the very remarkable assistance which they have givento the Common Cause since the beginning of this War. This assistance has gonefar beyond any promises or engagements made before the Wrar. In escorting home the convoys from Sierra Leone, the French cruisers and destroyers have played apart which could not otherwise have been supplied, and which, if not forthcoming,would simply have meant more slaughter of Allied merchantmen. The cruisers and contre torpilleurs which, with the Dunkerque, have covered the arrival of convoys in the Western Approaches, were at the time the only means by whichthe German raiders could be warded off. The maintenance of the Frenchsubmarines in the neighbourhood of Trinidad has been a most acceptable service.Above all, the two destroyers which constantly escort the homeward and outward-bound convoys between Gibraltar and Brest are an important relief to onrresources, which, though large and ever-growing, are at full strain.Finally, we are extremely obliged by the facilities given to the Argusaircraft-carrier to carry out her training of British naval aircraft pilots underthe favourable conditions of Mediterranean weather.7. Surveying the more general aspects of the War: the fact that the enemyhave no line of battle has enabled us to disperse our naval forces widely over theoceans, and we have seven or eight British hunting units joined by two Frenchhunting units, each capable of catching and killing a Deutschland.&apos; We are nowcruising in the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic and the Indian Oceans. Theresult has been that the raiders have not chosen to inflict the losses upon the convoys, which before the War it had been supposed they could certainlv do. Thefact that certainly one. and perhaps two. Deutschlandsbaxe been upon the mainAtlantic trade routes for several weeks without achieving anvthing. makes us feeleasier about this form of attack, which had formerly been rated extremely
dangerous. We cannot possibly exclude its renewal in a more energetic form.The British Admiralty think it is not at all objectionable to keep large vessels in suitable units ranging widely over the oceans where they are safe from Air attack, -and make effective and apparent the control of the broad waters for the Allies.8. We shall shortly be engaged in bringing the leading elements of theCanadian and Australian Armies to France, and for this purpose a widespreaddisposition of ail our hunting groups is convenient. It will also be necessaryto give battleship escorts to many of the largest convoys crossing the AtlanticOcean. We intend to maintain continually the Northern Blockade fromGreenland to Scotland, in spite of the severities of the winter. Upon thisblockade, twenty-five armed merchant-cruisers will be employed in reliefs,supported by four 8-inch-gun 10.000-ton cruisers, and behind these w? alwaysmaintain the main fighting forces of the British Navy, to wit. the latest battle-ships, and either the Hood or another great vessel, the whole sufficient to engageor pursue Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau should they attempt to break out.We do not think it likely that in view of the situation in the Baltic, these twovessels will be so employed. Nevertheless, we maintain continually the forcesnecessary to cope with them.It is hoped that by a continuance of this strategy by the two Allied Navies,no temptation will be offered to Italy to enter the war against us. and that theGerman power of resistance will certainly be brought to an end.9. The French Admiralty explained that they were in fact proceeding withthe completion of the vessels specified, and that they gladly accepted ourAsdic offer.Not only will the Richelieu be finished in the.summer of 1940. but also theJean Bart in the autumn.w. s. c.November 3, 1939.
