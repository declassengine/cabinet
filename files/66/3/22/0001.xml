THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTTS GOVERNMENT1&quot; TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.(aJsjnSgEgFNOoCOPY 210.He/AIR POLICY IN THT ITO&quot;T 0? A GERMAN INVASION OPHOLLAND. IF BELGIUg BOSS NOT CALL FOR ASSISTANCEReport by Chiefs of Staff Committee.our Report on Air Policy  we confined our attention to the circumstances which would arise if Belgiumwere invaded.     v&apos;e also stated that if Germany were to invade Holland simultaneously with Belgium, the problem wouldbe the same and the considerations affecting an invasion ofBelgium alone would also apply.Furthermore, we expressed the opinion that if holland only was invaded, bu:; the Belgians called us into their (i.e. Belgium&apos;s)assistance, our policy would again be the same.2. In this memorandum we have considered what weshould do if Eolland only were invaded and the Belgians donot call upon the Allies for assistance in the followingcircumstances:-(a) In the event of a German land invasion of holland, and(b) If German action was confined to flying their aircraft over Holland for the purpose ofmaking a major air attack on Great Britain.General Considerations. * .3. Anglo-French strategy for the conduct of the war against Germany has been to build up our forces in initial stages and, as far as our Air Force is concerned, to conserve our resources until the gap in our r-ir strength isnarrowed or until it is expedient for us to aepart fromthis policy.    &quot;7e do not recommend any departure from thispolicy.s Paper No. C.0.S.(39) 115 alsoPaper No. W.P.(39)118

4*        In Paper Be. C.0.Sc(39) 115 we considered tint -&quot;A German invasion of Belgium would constituteaction which looks like being decisive andtherefore that we should not shrink from usingall that we have got to defeat if.5.        Major British strategy is therefore quite clearlyto advance into, and hold as raich Belgian territory aspossible so as tc deny this to German Air and Naval Forces.!6s        The plan already agreed with ^he French high command, in the event of an invasion of Belgium is for an advance of the Allied Land Forces to hold positions inthat country as far forward as time and space will permit, subject to the caveat that we should avoidbecoming engaged in an encounter battle.7.        In order to bring all our Forces tc bear to achieve this aim, we have recommended the full use of the air striking Force, both against the German advance itself in belgium   and also against the specified military objective:&apos;.n the Ruhr (calculated to ceu*vo the maximum disruption to german war potential) simultaneously with the land action.Thus air strategy and land strategy are coraplementary.In fact, we do not regard tiie former as being decisive by itself.Action in the Event of an Invasion of Soil and.8.       If Germany invades Holland, ana the Belgians do notcall for assistance, there is nothing which we can do on land to prevent a German occupation of Holland.9.        In these circumstances any action which we take inthe air would not be complementary to our land strategy asin the case of a German invasion^of Belgium^10.       For these reasons we consider that it would not beto our advantage to attack with all our resources in theair and we recommend that our action &quot;aiould be confined i;oattacking such military objectives as would assist theDutch to delay the advancing German coTirnas.     Owing tothe lack of previous collaboration with the Butch, this action would have t:-b^ 7uin.ited to the bombing of the rear of the German columns on German territory.    This might at least enable the   Dutch tc carry out their inundationseffectively and allow time for the execution of plans to deny Dutch resources to the enemy.11.       Finally there is the political consideration thatsuch action, limited though it would be. would demonstrate that we are not permitting German aggression of Hollandto take place unopposed?Action in the Event of the Germans flying over Holland.12.       The mere violation of neutral air by Germany wouldnot confer upon her advantages commensurate with those she would obtain from a land invasion.     Clearly, therefore,there would be even less reason to depart from the agreed

policy set out in 3raragr --h 3 above.    Our action, there-fore, should be to make such use cf Butch air as ire rish,but to continue to pur-rue our present policy as agreed withthe French in respect of the selection of objectives.    Inthese circumstances it would be to our advantage for theDutch not to take any action likely to provoke  a Gernmland invasion.35,-     ^0 see up:-(a) Ho action of curs by land or air cenprevent a German occupation of Holland.(b) The cossiderEtions which have caused us torecommend a departure from cur original air &apos;strategy to meet the exceptional case of an invasion of Belgium (Paper Ho. 0.0.8.
