SJ Copy Ho. t%4*WfP,(?9) 112, IWAR CABIHET.     &apos;AIR REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARMY.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.The Lord Privy Seal in his memorandum .P..(39)110 has put forward for the consideration -of the itarCabinet a broad issue of policy on which a difference ofopinion has arisen between the War Office and the AirMinistry, involving a suggestion for a fundamentaldeparture from existing air policy and practice.2.     Briefly the point at issue is this:-The Secretary of State for War demands in effect thecreation of an Army Air Arm, under the complete and permanent control of the Army and ultimately trained and administered by the War Office.     This iB to include a large force of special type bombers manned by army officers, amounting to a total of 250 first line air-craft, together with the necessary pilots and reserves,by the Spring of 191+0 and ultimately to a much larger number, to be a &quot;permanent part of the mechanism directly under the Commander-ia-Chief in the Field&quot;.3.    The Air Ministry propose that bomber support for the Army shall be found from the main Air striking force, from which Squadrons should be allotted by theChiefs of Staff to operations in support of the Army, insuch proportions as may be necessary according to thesituation or to the plans projected.    The Air ministry are arranging for a proportion of the bomber force toreceive special training with .*Bie Asety- -just as a/proportion

mproportion now receive special training for the attack of ships at sea.    But they consider it vital to retain the Bomber Command a8 a homogeneous force, of which anypart, or the whole, can be immediately concentrated onwhatever task is of greatest importance at the time,whether it be counter-offensive operations in connectionwith the defence of this country against air attack,operations in support of the Navy against enemy navalor air forces threatening our coasts and sea bornetrade, or operations in support of the Allied Amies in france against enemy land and air attack.4.     The Secretary of State for War in his paper.P.(39) 111, after quoting a draft conclusion of thei+th Meeting of the land Porces Sub-Committee (which wasnot agreed and which in my view did not represent the sense of the Meeting) says that I am &quot;not willing toplace additional machines at the disposal of the Army toact under its orders&quot;.     I am not clear in what sensethe Secretary of State for War uses the word &quot;additional&quot;.I must emphasise at once -that, quite apart from theprinciple involved, it is impossible to provide, completewith the necessary reserves and trained personnel, bothground and air, 250 aircraft by the Spring of 19hO, saveby accepting a corresponding reduction in some otherdirection.    The outbreak of war found the air programmefar from completion, not only as to reserves of both menand material, but also as to first line aircraft.    We &apos;have many commitments of vital importance to be fulfilled, first among which is the need for manyadditional fighters to provide for the protection of theUnited Kingdom and our fleet bases from air attack, for/which

which purpose wo are Sorasiag new sguadrans as fast aspersonnel and material will permit.    The new situationin the North Sea forms an added commitment for our existing bomber force;   and in the Spring of 191(0 we mayhave to face a major enemy offensive through the low countries which; in accordance with our agreement withthe French, will involve the use of all availablebombers on tasks which can in no sense be described asclose support with the Army.5*     On a longer term view, moreover, I must remindmy colleagues of a factor of first-class importance,namely, the object of our air policy vis-a-vis Germany,which, under successive Governments and with&apos; the full agreement of the Chiefs of Staff for years past, hasbeen to achieve parity in air striking power withGermany.     The Prime Minister himself has expressed theview that the development of our air power must havefirst priority.     It was, indeed, on this proviso thatthe I*nd Forces Sub-Committee based their first report.As the War Cabinet are aware, the Air Ministry haveembarked on a programme of production aiming ultimatelyat 2,550 aircraft a month;   and on a correspondingpersonnel programme involving a vast training organisa-tion both at home and. in the Dominions.    But the fruitsof these efforts cannot &quot;be achieved for a considerable time.    If, therefore, a considerable proportion of our air resources is to be allotted exclusively to one role,and more especially If this proportion of our reservesis devoted to a class of tsnit which will be quite   .useless except in that one role, we must contemplate the indefinite postponement of the date when we can hope to/nave

have a striking force comparable to that of Germany.When I remind my colleagues of the dominating influencethat the German bomber force has exerted in recent timesI feel sure that our present grave Inferiority in thatvital direction is not a situation they would be willingto perpetuate.6.    The Secretary of State for War acknowledgesthat the problem of air support to the Army only assumedImportance consequent upon the decision, reached just before the war, to recruit a continental Army.     The AirMinistry, of course, do not question that decision, and fully accept- its implications.     It represents a fundamental change in our general defence policy, andour air policy must be adapted to meet it.    The AirMinistry are only too anxious to do all in their power,as I have shown, to make the new Army policy effective,but they cannot do this at the cost of abandoning thewhole basis of our accepted policy in the air.7*    A continental Army involves heavy demands onour resources in classes of aircraft other than bombers.It requires large numbers of Army Co-operation and reconnaissance Squadrons as well as Fighter Squadrons,and these must be found at the expense of Home DefenceFighter Squadrons, Coastal Command Squadrons, the fleet air Arm, or the Air Striking Force.    I must stress thefact that until the rate of aircraft production risesand training of personnel has made substantial progress,even the provision of the essential number ofReconnaissance and Fighter Squadrons will be a matter ofthe utmost difficulty.     If in addition we are to find/large

largo numbers of bombers &quot;continually under Armycontrol&quot; then they can only be found by taking themaway from our main Air Striking Force.    An allotmentof 250 first line bombers with reserves would mean areduction In this force of nearly 50% of its presentfirst line strength.    In any event, since specially designed aircraft (even if they wore desirable) cannotbe produced in quantity for at least 18 months andprobably more, the types to be provided for an Army air arm can only be those at present existing, namely, theBlenheim and Battle.8.    As regards the quotation from Lord Balfour inparagraph 3 of W.P. (39) 111, and the extract from theArmy Order of 1918, I would suggest that in these daysall three services are essentially inter-dependent andany attempt at complete self-sufficiency by any one service is bound not only to be uneconomical, but alsoto react adversely on the spirit of co-operation and mutual support which is absolutely essential if we areto win this war.     I cannot subscribe to the statement that direct support aircraft are like any othersupporting weapon and must therefore be continually underArmy control if the Army is to fulfil its functions.This is not the system in Germany, and the operations in poland were a conclusive proof of the efficiency withwhich an entirely autonomous air force can support anArmy.    Further, I must contest the deduction made inparagraph k in respect of these operations.     I am aware that there were instances in which close support on the battlefield was effective.    But by far the greatesteffect was achieved by long range bomberB of the same/types

types as those recently shot down&apos; in Scotland, operating against the enemy reserves, communications and head-quarters, miles to the rear of his forward troops.    I attach as Appendix A a short note by the Air IntelligenceStaff on this point.9.     Finally, I hope my colleagues will reject atonce the implication in paragraphs 7 and 8 of theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for War - namely,that,-at this of all times, we should break up thepresent organisation of the Air Force, and return to the bad old system of dual control and competition in production, man power and training, which, until theintroduction of unified control in these matters, was such a wasteful and inefficient feature of our air -organisation of the last war.     In particular, I wish to record my conviction that if the War Office is to beallowed to enter into competition with the Air ministry in ordering or acquiring airframes, aero-engines and accessories of any type for any purpose, then the resultin the sphero of aircraft production will be chaotic.10.   We have built up a great Service in the last21 years,, a Service which lias never-been lacking in thespirit of co-operation with the two older arms.     Ishould regard any attempt to upset the organisation ofthat Service as intensely undesirable at any time;   todo so in the opening stages of a great war, in flatdenial of the lessons learnt in 1914-18, when all ourenergies should be directed to the ultimate defeat ofthe enemy, would, in my view, be disastrous.     I,therefore, ask my colleagues to instruct the General/Staff

Staff and Air Staff to work out in conjunction, and toput into effect immediately,, the measures necessary toenable the Air Force to afford the greatest possiblesupport of all kinds to the Army, on the basis of our existing organisation and within the framework of our existing system of co-ordination and control.Air Ministry.3rd November, 1939*NOTE:   I attach as Appendix &quot;B&quot; a short note on thepresent arrangements for the air supportof the Army, which are slightly different from those outlined in paragraph 3 of theMemorandum by the lord Privy Seal.

Appendix A.Note on the organisation of the German reconnaissance andbomber forces.In the German Air Force reconnaissance is regardedas a specialist subject read units are provided and trainedto meet the particular requirements of each branch of theservices.    Thus there are long range reconnaissancesquadrons to provide information for the Bomber Force^There are long and short range reconnaissance squadrons to provide information for the Army Commander cv for the corps and Divisional Commanders, and finally there arereconnaissance squadrons for operations over the sea.Specialisation does not, however, extend to the bomber force, which is organised and trained with one object inview, namely to attack whatever targets are allotted to it.-As an example a long range Geschwader K,G.26 took part in theoperations in Silesia in Septemher, and was next indentified in the attack on units of the Fleet to the North of scotland on the 9th October.2.      Furthermore, there is no differentiation betweenthe heavy long range bomber and the short range dive bomber,-and the type to be used for any particular purpose isselected according to the distances to be flown and the type of target to be attacked.     In the particular circumstances in Poland the long range bomber appears tohave been more successful against troops ttian the divebomber, which was largely used against bridges, power stations, aircraft factories, etc     The German organisationaims at achieving the maximum flexibility, so that the wholeBomber Force can be switched at short notice from onecategory of targets to another.

a.5,    She effective use of German bombers against thePolish, formations was solely due to the absence of any properanti-aircraft and fighter defence.    The tactics which were successful In Poland would have involved prohibitivecasualties if attempted against an organised system of air defence.    Even in the Spanish War the German units wereforbidden to make low attacks against troops in the battle area, owing to the heavy casualties which had been sustained in some of the earlier attempts.4.    The German Staff Manual is clear on this point.After referring to the importance of attacking objectives-^in the rear of the zone of operations it states&quot;In the actual theatre of ground operations there&quot;are as a rule no suitable objectives for bomber forceB.&quot;On the whole, in ground bombing methods, the result does not&quot;correspond with the amount of men and material involved.&quot;The nature of the terrain may Improve the prospects of&quot;intervention in the theatre of ground operations, but&quot;bomber forces used in this way are greatly endangered.&quot;Very critical situations may, however, necessitate the&quot;use of bomber forces in the theatre of ground operations.&quot;5.    It is therefore clear that German Staff doctrineis against the use of bombers in the land battle.    Even in poland, where there was virtually no anti-aircraft defence in the zone of the armies, the main weight of German attack was directed against objectives in rear of the militaryoperations.     It was the delay and confusion caused by damage to railways, roads and telegraph ccanmunlcations which was mainly responsible for the disaster of the Polish retreat.

Co-operation, etc.,Fighter protection.Found by squadrons of the Air Component, under the command of C-ln-C.., B.E.F.Bomber Support.Found by squadrons of Bomber Command, which will be allotted to support of the B.E.F. by the Chiefs ofStaff in accordance with the requirements of thesituation.     Such support will normally be provided in the first instance from the medium bomber squadronBof the Advanced Air Striking Force located la France.In the event of land operations of major importance,additional support may be made available to the B.E.F.,or the Group of Allied Armies of which it forms a part,by a decision of the War Cabinet acting on the advice of the Chiefs of Staff.     In addition there is anarrangement whereby C-in-C. B.E.F., can call direct onthe Advanced Air Striking Force for up to two squadrons to meet a fleeting opportunity, If the Advanced air striking Force is not fully engaged in other duties.The general direction, allocation of objectives, etc. tobomber squadrons operating in support of the Army willbe the responsibility of the Army Commander concerned.(NOTE: There are two medium bomber squadrons includedin the Air Component of the B.E.F., but their role is primarily long distance reconnaissance).APPESDIX *B*The present arrangements for the air support ofthe Army are as follows:-:Reconnaissance, Artillery
