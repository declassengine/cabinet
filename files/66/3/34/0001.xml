(39) 134.COPY NO.  3 bGERMAN OIL SUPPLIES.First Report by the Minjeter without portfolio and the U-nister forCo-ordination op Defence!I.     GENERAL.1.On 17th October the War Cabinet invited us to keep under constant review, in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, the action being taken to prevent oil supplies from reaching Germany and the organisation required for thispurpose j   and to keep the War Cabinet informed of the position.(Cabinet 50 (39), Conclusion 8).     This interim report is submitted in order to inform the War Cabinet of the presentposition.2o        Our enquiry orginated from a report by the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee covering the report of an Interdepart-mental Committee on the oil situation in Germany which hadbeen prepared under the Chairmanship of the Secretary for mines (W.P. (39) 90).     Although it was emphasised in thelatter report that there were many unknown factors in thesituation, the general deduction was that, in the spring of1940, Germany&apos;s oil position is likely to be critical as shewill by then have expended an amount equivalent to all herincoming supplies, and, even taking maximum supply figures,two-thirds of her war reserves.     This calculation was basedon the assumption that contraband control measures are sucess-ful in preventing the re-export of petroleum to Germany fromadjacent neutral countries, and that means can be found ofdealing satisfactorily with the potential transit tradethrough Italy.-1-

II.     DEPARTMENTAL ORGANISATION AIDCO-ORDINATION.S.        The main responsibility for preventing oil supplies from reaching Germany rests with the Minister of EconomicT7arfares but in this matter, as in the case of other supplies,active co-operation is given by other Government Departments.It would be beyond the scope of this report to describe thegeneral system of co-ordination between the Ministry andother Government Departments.     It is necessary, however, to mention one item in this system which applies to oil productsonly, namely, a Committee for securing co-ordination with the oil Control Board and the Petroleum Department, which areresponsible for effecting purchases on behalf of the ministry for the purpose of preventing oil from reaching Germany.Details of the Co-ordinating Committee are given below inparagraph 9.4.        When the War Cabinet discussed the matter on 17th0ctoberthe Minister for Economic Warfare advised that some expansionof his organisation would be necessary to deal effectively with the subject.     It was of supreme importance to get thefullest possible information, which was obtained from both &apos;consular and secret sources, though as yet proper co-or*linatiorwas lacking.5.        It is, of course, essential that the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare should be equipped with an adequate andcompetent staff to handle the large amount of intelligence thatreaches Headquarters.     That was one of the main difficultiesat the first, but thanks to the co-operation of the Treasury,who realize the great importance that the War Cabinet attach to the oil factor in economic warfare, this particular difficulty is being surmounted.6.        At the time when we began our inquiry the organisationof the Ministry of Economic Warfare for handling oil questionswas still in embryo. .   The Minister, however, has now made pro-gresB with his plans for setting up a special organisation in-2-

his Department to deal with the oil problems as awhole.     The information upon which this specialorganisation bases its work includes the following subjects:-(1)   Estimates of Germany&apos;s stocks, domestic production, capacity and imports,.(2)   Details of German refining plants and installations and rail and water transport facilities where applicable.(3)   Statistical information covering shipments to contiguous neutrals, together withestimates of stocks and consumption ineach neutral country concerned^(h)   Collection and appreciation of other information germane to the problem,especially as regards leakage ofsupplies to Germany from all sources.7.        The collection and collation of this information is the work of a special Petroleum Section in the intelligence Department who obtain their information from records already available, from correspondenceintercepted by the Censor, from contacts with tradesources and other sources of intelligence mentionedin Section III below.8.        This special Section consists of three officials of the Intelligence Department who give their whole time to this work and are assisted, as the case may require, by other Sections of the Intelligence Depart-ment and hy a petroleum expert working under theAdviser on Policy.9*        The collated information thus provided isconsidered by the joint committee already mentionedin paragraph 3, which consists of the Eead of the intelligence department and the Adviser on Policy withtheir assistants, and a representative of the petroleum Department.     The latter official acts asliaison officer for oil questions between the two-3-

Departments both for interchange of information an&amp;for giving technical advice as necessary,.    Thiscommittee, which advises the Minister as to policy,is designed to combine the Petroleum Department9 experience and contacts with the fresh informationcoming daily into the Ministry of Economic Warfarefrom all sources.10, At the present time purchases of oil in neutral countries which as will be seen later, are an important factor in the exercise of economic pressure on germany, are dealt with by the Petroleum department under the authority of the Oil Control Board.     In any point of difference where agreement cannot be reachedthrough the machinery indicated in the preceding para-graphs we recommend that the matter should forthwith bereferred to ourselves (the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence and the Minister without Portfolio) for settlement. ^III.     FOREIGN UTTELLIGENCE.11.        The intelligence system abroad, on which theDepartment depends for the supply of the essentialinformation mentioned in paragraph 6, involves adequateintelligence from many sources, e.g.(i) Consular information of sailings of tankers.(ii) Consular information of arrivals atneutral ports.(iii) Information from the contraband controlsin the North Sea, the approaches to the thames, and in the Mediterranean now &quot;being established.(iv) Secret information as to how much oil.iscrossing the German Frontier,particularly &quot;train watching&quot;.12.        In order to obtain this information it has been necessary to increase the consular staffs in certainplaces.     Here again the Treasury is giving every possible assistance.     Additional funds were also

required for S. 3. sources and are being supplied.13.        The above arrangements are designed to providea system of checks and counterchecks by which toobtain reasonably accurate intelligence of movementbof oil into Germany, but it must be realised thatthe enemy has learnt a great deal from his experience in the last war and is resorting to all kinds of cunning devices in order to evade our measuresof observation and restrictions    The intelligencesystem of the Ministry of Economic warfare, besidesobtaining information, has the task of unveilingand countering these designs.IV.       COHTSABAIH) COETROL.1h*        As already indicated, contraband control is required in connection with oil supplies partly for checking information,.     In addition, however,it i6 essential for the purpose of stoppingsuspected vessels and sending them into port forsearch or as prize.15*        In northern waters the system of contraband control Is rapidly improving as the number of auxillary merchant ships available for the northernpatrol increases and as experience is gained.The leakage of oil into Germany for October was estimated by the Ministry of Economic Warfare at10,000 tons through Holland, and 32,000 tons throughScandinavia.    We are informed, however, thatthe Contraband Committee has some doubts asto the reliability of some of the Dutchguarantees and that the Ministry of Economic

Warfare has the matter vii&amp;er active consideration16.     In the Mediterranean contraband control is especially important for the reason that the Italians have indicatedtheir inability to control transit trade through the port of Trieste, where, by treaty, part of the harbour has become a  German free port;   also because there is little likelihood-hood of obtaining agreement from the Yugoslav Government toprevent the transit of goods from Susak or other ports toGermany.17.     Contraband control has been in operation for some timein the Straits of Gibraltar and for ships entering theMediterranean through the Suez Canal.     The establishmentof contraband control at the entrance to the Dardanelles-^has proved more difficult, since there is no adjacentBritish port or anchorage to wMcii ships can be taken for examination, and the conduct of a contraband control service in the open sea, especially in winter, presents considerabledifficultiesi     After discussion with the Admiralty and theMinistry of Economic Warfare we recommended the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to sound His IJajesty&apos;s ambassador at Ankara as to the possibility of allowing Turkishterritorial waters to be used for this purpose, but the ambassador advised that the Turkish Government was not likelyto agree in existing international conditions.,     The prospects of a successful appeal to Athens for the use of Lemnos or some other Greek Island were also not considered very hopefil.The Admiralty have accordingly decided, and given orders tothe Naval Conrnander-^i-Chief, to establish at once aninterception patrol off the mouth of the Dardanelles and tosend ships in for examination to Malta or to Haifa as may be most appropriate.   . We agree in this decision and in theAdmiralty view   that only if it fails to give satisfactory results should further consideration be given to thepossibility of persuading Greece to provide us with a base.--6-. &apos;

V.       ITALY AIE) SVflTZERLAHD.18.     We have already referred in paragraph 15 to thedifficulty of preventing oil from reaching Germany throughItaly.     The Italian Government have undertaken to notify tous through the Joint Cavu-committee in Rome the names of ships carrying oil supplies whose destination is Italy^ and thatgoes some way towards simplifying the problem.     It will,however, be necessary to keep a careful watch to see that this undertaking   is observed, and that can only be done by agents.19.     One complication has already been mentioned, namely,the free port established by agreement between the Germanand Italian Governments in a part of the harbour at Triestewhere consular officers, supplemented by agents, will watch the situation.     Another complication is the refineries atAquila near Trieste and at Romsa, the products of which arenot easy to follow up.     Information on the subject hashitherto been somewhat conflicting.     On the one hand we were informed that the only shipments to Germany since the out-break of war from the Aquila refinery were on pre-war account and came from vessels which had taken refuge in Trieste, andthat the Company has cancelled its pre-war contract withGermany.     On the oth^r hand it is reported that early inOctober 10,000 tons of petroleum were despatched from the refinery by rail to Germany.     The Rorasa refinery also has a contract to export to Germany, which, so far as is known, hasnot been cancelled, and there are reports of train-loads ofpetroleum products leaving Genoa and Venice as well as Triestefor the German frontier via Tarvisio and Udine.20.     A third complication is the position of Switzerland,which can be supplied with oil partly through the Rhine,partly through Prance, but mainly through Italy.     Switzerlandalso is in the French sphere of economic warfare andarrangements have to be concerted with the French authorities.There is some reason to believe that a leakage -of oil into germany is taking place through that country, and as soon asdefinite evidence can be obtained appropriate action will betaken.

21.      An estimate basea on the actual arrival or dates dueof ships carrying petroleum to Italy indicates that during october Italian imports did not much exceed 250,000 tons,including orders for Ocvernment   account.    This figure is somewhat lower than average monthly Italian imports,5 but. .there has been a fall in Italian consumption since the out-break of war, and the Ministry of Economic Warfare&apos;s estimateplaces German imports of oil through Italy during Octoberat 45,000 tonso22.      The Minister of Economic Warfare hopes to reach an understanding with the Chief Italian importers of petroleum products with the object of guarding against the re-export to Germany of imported supplies.     Nevertheless, the complications in.the Italian position mentioned above tend to.emphasise the importance of an adequate intelligence system and of contraband control at all the entrances to theMediterranean. , .VI.       ROUKANIA.   PURCHASE OF OIL.(The general purport of this section of ourmemorandum was reported to the War Cabinetverbally oh November 16th ).23*      So far as Roumanian oil products are concerned, theprincipal method of keeping them out of Germany is by purchase.A contributory method both for preventing supplies from reaching Germany and for slowing down their arrival is bypurchase or charter of means of transport such as tugs andbargeB on the Danube and oil waggons on the railways.   Resorthas been made to all these methods.24*      Dealing first with purchase, on 12th September theWar Cabinet decided that steps should be taken to buy asmuch as^possible of the Roumanian oil with the object of preventing it from going to Germany.x   In 1938 Italian imports per month were290,000 tons according to figures in the petroleum Department.

25*    When we began our enquiry on 17th October we found thata plan for carrying out this decision by using, for purposesof purchase, commercial oil companies under British and Frenchinfluence, was in full operation.    We were informedperiodically that the operation was believed to be proceedingaccording to plan, but on 10th November we learnt that it wasnot likely to be as successful as had been anticipated.Corrected figures show that the total amount of British andFrench purchases for the months October to December was about551^000 tons   (See Appendix ).26.    The reasons given by the representatives of the companies for this comparative failure were partly financial and partlypolitical.     The financial reasons were due in part to thedecision of the Cabinet on 13th September that all payments should be made in blocked sterling, but they were also affectedby the rates of exchange for Lei which were allowed by theterms of the clearing arrangements.   At the end of the first week in November negotiations had taken place between theTreasury and the Roumanian Minister in London as to the clear-ing arrangements, as the result of which fresh proposals bythe Treasury affecting oil purchases were forwarded by courierto Bucharest by the Roumanian Minister.   At the time when thedisappointing results of the purchase arrangements were reported to us (lOth November) no reply had been received.27.    Turning now to the political side, the difficulties inmaking purchases on the desired scale were reported to be due mainly to Roumania,s fear lest, by allowing the Allies topurchase too much oil, they might irritate Germany to thepoint at which she would take forcible actions   An additionalreason was the desire, by playing off Germany against theAllies, to raise the price of oil, with the result that thenegotiations threatened to become more those of an auctionroom than of a business transaction.

88* -      In consultation with the Minister of Economic War-fare, the Secretary for Mines, representatives of the Treasuryeand Foreign Office, and Lord Cadman, we arranged that a mission composed of Mr. Bridgeman, the Adviser on Oil to theMinistry of Economic Warfare, and a representative of theTreasury, Mr. Hall-Patch, should proceed at once to Bucharest.Their main object was to be to elicit an immediate reply tothe Treasury1s proposals for revising the clearingarrangements and, if necessary, to make recommendations forthe modification of these proposals in order to obtain the desired result - that is to say, the purchase on the mostreasonable terms possible of the maximum amount of oil.   Theseofficials were instructed to make contact with MonsieurWenger, the French expert engaged on similar operations.   Ithad been represented to us that it was most important thatthe above mission should receive the strongest possiblediplomatic support with the King and the Government ofBoumanla.    We therefore   asked the Foreign Office to draft instructions to the British Minister so as to secure hisfull support.29.       The Foreign Office instructions are, of course, basedon the Cabinet*s policy to purchase as much as possible of roumanian oil with the object of preventing it going toGermany.    The British Minister in Bucharest, however, haswarned the Government, as has Monsieur Wenger, that it wouldbe fatal to press the Roumanian Government beyond a certainpoint, and that Roumania would have to be allowed to send acertain amount of oil to Germany just as Denmark has been allowed to send a certain amount of food to Germany in orderthat we might obtain our own requirements from that country..In these circumstances the Foreign Office urged that it wouldbe impossible for the British Minister to conduct a negotiation unless he were given some idea of the amount

of oil which His Majesty1 s Government felt oouM bo allowedto go to Germany without upsetting our own policy.After considering the matter with the Ministers and departments concerned we came to the conclusion that the approximate figure should not exceed one million tons per annum.     This quantity corresponds with the figurearrived at quite independently by Monsieur Wenger, andwas the actual amount imported by Germany from Roumaniaduring the last year before the war.     It is three-quarters of a million tons less than the maximum figure importedby Germany from Roumania in any of the last four years,and it is a quarter of a million tons below the average figure for that period.     It is much less than theestimates o? probable and maximum imports contained inthe Report of the Committee presided over by theSecretary for Mines (W.P.(39) 90), which varied between a&quot;probable&quot; and &quot;maximum&quot; supply of 2 and 4 million tons for 12 months from 1st September, 1939.30.      The War Cabinet, to whom we reported thesematters verbally on 16th November, endorsed our decision that the figure allowed to Germany should notexceed one million tons a year.31.       It is not contemplated that the two expertsreferred to in paragraph 29 should remain in Roumaniafor more than a week or two.     After that they will bereplaced by a permanent official who will be attachedto the Legation at Bucharest to arrange and co-ordinatefuture purchases.     This official will represent boththe Petroleum Department and the Ministry of economic warfare.    His reports will normally be sent throughthe Minister, but he will have the right to communicate

direct with the two Departments on matters concerningthem.     The official in question has been selected andis spending a week in this country to study the various aspects of the questions with which he 1b to deal before proceeding to bis post.    We should have liked to have seen a Treasury representative attached permanently tothe Legation at Bucharest to collaborate with therepresentative of the Petroleum Department and theMinistry of Economic Vifarfare, but we realise that inthe present pressure it is impossible for the Chancellorof the Exchequer to spare an official for this purpose.32.      We wish to emphasise that the function of thetemporary officials referred to in paragraphs 28 and 31,as well as of the permanent official mentioned inparagraph 31 are not themselves to purchase petroleum products on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    Weare assured that the establishment of a quasi-Governmentalorganisation in Roumania for oil purchase would be extremely vulnerable to German pressure.     Their object is rather to establish political and financial contactswhich will smooth the path of the commercial purchasersand enable them to carry out the task already entrusted to them.33.        The oil purchased by the oil companies will be sold either to the Petroleum Board or to Mediterraneancountries.     The Petroleum Board will take as much ubpossible, but it is undesirable to disturb homemarkets unduly.

54.        It is to be feared that high prices are bound toprevail as   Germany&apos;s need for oil products is such thatshe will pay almost any price.      If this happens Roumanianoil may reach a price beyond the capacity of the normalpurchasers in the Mediterranean and it might even benecessary for our companies to sell some of -Eae oil theyhave purchased at a loss, with reimbursement from theBritish Government.        In that event especially, butindeed in all sales to Mediterranean or other foreigncountries within reach of   Germany, it will be necessaryfor the Ministry of Economic   Warfare and the PetroleumDepartment in conjunction to exercise the utmost vigilanceand to assure themselves that conditions are attached whichwill prevent the oil in any circumstances from reachingGermany.55.      In order to avoid continually rising prices it isdesirable to make purchases as far ahead as possible.     the ideal would be to buy Roumania&apos;s total output for a periodof, say, a year, but in practice, having regard to thecustom of this market, it is unlikely that we shall beable to purchase for more than two months ahead.VII.       ROUMANIA._CHARTERING OF TRANSPORT.36.        As mentioned above in paragraph 23, a supplementarymethod of hampering German purchases of oil in Roumaniais by purchasing or chartering the various means oftransport.37.        On 16th November the   War Cabinet authorised theBritish Minister in Bucharest to take advantage of aopportunity of 48 hours within which to charter a fleet of 90 grain barges of a capacity of 100,000 tons, togetherwith 19 tug boats totalling 5S600 horse-power at a totalcost of about  54,000.        The interesting features of

this transaction are first, that the   German State&apos;8Grain and Foodstuffs Purchasing Department have hitherto&quot;been operating this fleet and had asked their suppliers to renew their charter;   and second, that we had learnt onthe previous day that the Germans intended to convertgrain barges for the use of oil.      The Admiralty areexploring the possibility of utilising in the eastern mediterranean barges taken up in Roumanian if this is permitted by the terms of the charter and the barges provesufficiently seaworthy.       It should be noted that thisis not the first transaction of the kind, and that, inaddition to barges, a certain number of oil railwaywaggons have been hired and removed to the Eastern part of roumania.38.        There is a good deal of evidence, both from public and secret sources, that the transport of oil to   germany from Roumania has been considerably hampered.       TheMinister without Portfolio made a verbal statement on certain aspects of Roumanian comnunications at the meetingof the War Cabinet on 3rd November (W.M. (39) 69thConclusions, Minute 5).VIII.   RFJ-AFJCS.39.        To calculate the amount of the oil products ofwhich Germany can dispose will always be a matter ofc-considerable difficulty.     At the present time, when ourorganisation is still in embryo on the sides of intelligence and of planning and of action, it is particularly difficult.All we have to work upon are the monthly reports fromthe Ministry of   Economic Warfare&apos;s Intelligence department for September and October, which are compiled inconsultation with the Petroleum Department and will become more reliable as the sources of intelligence are developed.

In the following table these results are compared with theestimate of the position in the first six months of a warcontained in the   Report of Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd1 s Committee(W. P.(39)90).Geoffrey Lloyd Report(W.P.(39) 90T.Col. 1.1st 6 months.tons is 1   Sept. 3,000,0001959.Col.Averageper month,tonssticroductionia 4land, (probable)ajaxinum)oniaion ofJmtrabandControl1,200,000     200,000250,000800,0001,600,00042,000133,000)266,5,00o](probable) 375,000 J(maximum)    508,000 \Reports from M.E.W.Intelligence department/351/1. &quot;Col. 3.September.tons200,00010,00090,000129,000429,000Col. 4.October.tons200,000^9,00094,0007,00067,000397,000Estimated.      ^40.       In examining the comparison it is important to note that the Geoffrey Lloyd Report did not attemptan estimate for evasion of contraband control.   Suchevasion is, of course, always bound to take place in greater or less degree, but it could not be calculated in advance.   As the machinery improves the extent ofthe evasion should be reduced, and it is satisfactory to note that the figure for October (87,000 tons) is considerably less than that for September (129,000 tons.)

41,     In almost every other respect the monthly figuresof oil obtained by Germany are markedly below the monthly average calculated from the Geoffrey Lloyd Report, e.gRussia and Poland about 10,000 tons a month compared withthe Geoffrey Lloyd estimate of 42,000 tons, and Rounanlaabout 92,000 tons compared with the estimate of from133*000 - 266,000 tons.42.     At this early stage, however, we do not attachmuch reliance to these estimates, and it would be premature, in view of the extraordinary difficulties with which the Ministry of Economic Warfare is confronted,for us to venture on any forecast of the prospects of reducing Germany^ stocks and supplies of oil to thepoint where her military effort would be seriouslyhandicapped.43.     In consultation with the Departments concerned we propose to continue to keep a vigilant eye on thesituation and to render to the Ministers concerned allthe support and assistance in our power withoutencroaching in any way on their responsibility.   we will see that the Cabinet are kept informed on tillsimportant aspect of economic warfare.(Signed) Hanky..CHATPIELD.!12ShSovember. 1939. &apos;
