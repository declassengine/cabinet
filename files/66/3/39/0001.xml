Copy No&quot;.WEEKLY REPORT (NO.12) OP AIR OPERATIONS AMDINTELLIGENCE FOR THE WEEK ENDING MIDNIGHT, 26THNOVEMBER j 1939.I?  &quot;   &apos; : &apos;German Air Force.1.     There has been little activity by the German bomber force during the past week.     Recent flights to the Shetlandsand the north of Scotland have probably had a direct connectionti iiwith the movements of the Deutschland.     The week has beennotable for the use of aircraft for the first time in layingmines:   they weigh about 1,000 lbs. and have been carried by german seaplanes operating from stations in the heligoland bight.     Mines could, however, be carried by some of the Germanlong distance bombers with some modification of the normal bombstowage.2.     Pursuing German Aircraft into Neutral Air.     TheFrench Government have notified the Belgian Government that french aircraft will pursue German aircraft which attempt to escape pursuit by flying over Belgian territory.French Air Force.3.     The French air force has continued to makereconnaissance flights, and pamphlets have been dropped InGerman territory on a number of occasions:   no unusual activity has been observed behind the enemy&apos;s lines.    A large number of patrols have been carried out by individual French fighters, andit is reported that on the 22nd November three enemy fighters were shot down:   another was destroyed probably by anti-aircraft fire, and yet another landed intact at Strasbourg,probably owing to engine trouble.     On the same day an enemybomber was shot down near Ostend.     Three enemy bomber &apos;reconnaissance aircraft are. reported to have been destroyed bythe French on the 23rd November, and one by French and Britishfighters.A.

2. i    -; -it-.     Enemy Air Activity.    From the 11 th to 20th NovemberGerman reconnaissance flights have been directed over theChannel coast area from Dunkirk to Treport, along the Franco-Belgian frontier^ and over the interior of France.     The flightsover the Channel coast and the Franco-Belgian frontier tookplace when German operations against Holland were expected.They were presumably undertaken to discover the location andstrength of the Allied forces along the Belgian frontier and tofind out whether reinforcements were arriving at the channel ports.     The long flights over the interior of France were almost certainly undertaken for propaganda reasons.     TheGerman Air Attache&apos; in Madrid stated to some of his colleagues that they were intended to show the public in Spain and Italythat flights similar to those of Royal Air Force aircraft over germany could be undertaken by German aircraft.ROYAL AIR FORCE OPERATIONS.Bomber Command.5.     Operations against the German Fleet.     As a result ofthe location of the &quot;Deutschland&quot; in Icelandic waters onThursday November 23rd, arrangements were made to meet anydevelopments which might have arisen in the naval situation.All mobilisable squadrons, except one; v/ere ordered to standby at one hour&apos;s notice from 6.30 a.m. on 20th November.    the equivalent of four bomber squadrons, consisting of Hampden andWhitley aircraft, were sent to aerodromes at Wick and Kinlossin the North of Scotland.     Bombs had been loaded before theaircraft left their parent stations, and they stand ready for operations.6.     Reconnaissances of German Naval Bases.    At therequest of the Admiralty, four Whitley aircraft made a reconnaissance of German naval bases at Wilhelmshaven,Cuxhaven, Brunsbuttel and Heligoland on the&quot;night of 2h/25th/November,

November, &quot;but poor visibility and unfavourable weatherprevented useful information being obtained.     In order to conceal from the enemy the purpose of the operation,propaganda leaflets were dropped.     The reconnaissance was repeated on the following day by four Blenheim aircraft, but no capital ships were Been.7.     Night Recomaissance and Leaflet Dropping.     On fouroccasions successful leaflet-dropping flights were carried out without casualties to our own aircraft:   a total of 720,000leaflets of a new style, printed in the form of a newspaper,were dropped over Bremen, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Stuttgart.Fighter Command.8.     Enemy Aircraft.     German aircraft increased their activities during the week over the North Sea and along ourcoasts.     A number of flights were made over ports andestuaries for the purpose of laying mines, and reconnaissancesand raids took place over the Orkneys and Shetlands.On November 20th a Heinlcel III crossed the south coast at Brighton, and after flying over London and Eornchurch,turned east along the Thames estuary.     The aircraft was engaged by a section of 7h (Fighter) Squadron, but the engage-ment did not appear to be conclusive;    the crew of the Heihkelwere, however, picked up in the North Sea on the following day by H.M.S. &quot;Gipsy&quot;.     On the same day a German seaplane,reported eight miles east of Clacton, was engaged by fighterswithout known result.    After dark on the 20th November anumber of enemy aircraft were reported off the coast in variouspositions between Felixstowe and Dungeness;   one flew down theStraits of Dover and others were active off Harwich, Deal, andin the Thames estuary.     These movements were reported at once to the Admiralty in a note which suggested that the aircraft might have been engaged in laying mines./On

On the 21st November a Dornier17 approached thecoast off Deal and rae shot down by three of our Fighters:there were no survivors.     After nightfall enemy seaplanesdropped mines off Harwich, Dover, and in the Humber estuary.One of the enemy seaplanes alighted on the water:   it tookoff soon afterwards and disappeared into the clouds.     our fighter aircraft were hampered by fog, but a Blenheim engagedone of the enemy without definite result.On the night .of the 22nd November, enemy aircraftagain carried out mine-laying operations in the thames estuary, dropping mines off Southend, Shoeburyness, and alsooff the North Foreland and Dunkirk.     It was reported at thetime that anti-aircraft guns had brought down an enemy air-craft off All Hallows.     Wreckage subsequently discovered mayhave come from this aircraft.On November 22nd, six enemy aircraft dropped bombs on Lerwick North Harbour.     One flying-boat moored in the harbour was hit and destroyed.     To meet raids in this areathree fighter aircraft have been detached to operate fromSumburgh in the Shetlands.9.     Long-range Fighter Fatrols.    Long-range fighterpatrols have been arranged with the object of destroyingenemy mine-dropping aircraft before they leave their bases.On the 26th November, the first day on which weather conditions permitted an operation of this nature, eightBlenheim aircraft set out for Borkum, but owing to extremelybad weather conditions and low visibility, they failed tomake a landfall and returned without having sighted anyhostile ships or aircraft.10.   Defence against Mine-drooping.     As ail additionalpercaution against the dropping of mines by enemy aircraft,/balloons

balloons are to bb flown from lighters in the Thames estuary,and off Harwich.     Water-borne searchlights will be provided to increase the illuminated zone in the Thames estuary, andBoforB guns will be mounted in small craft.Coastal Command.11.   Routine patrols, anti-submarine patrols, searches,reconnaissances and convoy escorts have continued, althoughroutine patrols were considerably modified during the latter part of the week in order that aircraft might be free to search for the &quot;Deutschland&quot;.     Offensive patrols have been undertaken by Hudson aircraft with the object of locating anddestroying enemy aircraft;   the fishing fleets in the Northand Irish Seas have been provided with escorts on all days when the weather was suitable, and 28 convoys have receivedair escort, involving the use of 12h aircraft.As a result of these activities, one submarine, alarge number of merchant vessels, several mines, and ten enemy aircraft have been sighted.     The submarine was attacked withunknown result, and two of the enemy aircraft were engaged.One of the aircraft, a Dornier 18, had been attacked three times when a Heinkel III appeared and forced our aircraft toabandon the fight.     It is believed that the Dornier suffered damage, but there has been no confirmation that it was shot down.     On one occasion an aircraft was diverted from patrolto go to the assistance of a merchant ship which was beingshelled by a O-fboat;   the merchant, ship, S.S. &quot;Pensilva&quot;, waslocated in a sinking condition with a^djestroyer standing by.Depth charges were dropped from the destroyer , and large airbubbles and oil appeared on the surface.     No bombs were dropped, since it was considered that the U-boat was at too great a depth for bombing action to be effective./Intensive

. v  - tm-   I I pp &apos; 6.    &apos; &apos; W:AIntensive searches for the ^Dcutschland&quot; have &quot;beencarried out since the 23rd, weather interfering to a great extent on the 26th.    One flying boat set out on patrol at  .30 p.m. on the 23rd, and did not return until 9.0 a.m. onthe 20th, during which time it reconnoitred a largo area of sea to the north of the Faroes;   the search has so far been unsuccessful.Advanced Air Striking Force.12.   There have been 57 patrols during the week, ofwhich 23 were made on Thursday, 23rd November.     Qn this day,the only one on which engagements with enemy aircraft tookplace, seven enemy bombers were shot down, six falling in french territory.     One of our fighters was forced to landowing to enemy fire, and one crashed on landing as a resultof a French fighter colliding with it.Boyal Air Force Component of the British Expeditionary Force.13.  ^Army Co-operation.     All three Wings have continued their training and photographic tasks as ordered by Generaland Corps Headquarters.1h*   Fighters.    Patrols have been carried out daily whenweather conditions permitted, and two engagements with enemy aircraft have been reported.     On November 21st, a Heinkel IIIwas engaged, by a pilot of No.85 Squadron, who fired sevenbursts, but the enemy disappeared, in a spiral, through theclouds.     This engagement took place at the same time, and inapproximately the same area, namely, near Deal, as thatreported in paragraph 8 above, between aircraft of No.79 .  .Squadron and a German aircraft.     Only one aircraft hasjhowever, been confirmed as crashing into the Bea.On 23rd November, two fighter pilots engaged anenemy aircraft over the coast.    After several bursts had/been

&quot;been fired, the enemy dived into the clouds, from which it wasnot seen to emerge.     An unconfirmed Preea notice states thaton the same day a German aircraft forced-landed in Belgiumafter being attacked by two fighters.15.   Bombers.     Owing to unfavourable v/eather, only tworeconnaissances have been carried out during the past week.On the 23rd November, one aircraft carried out a reconnaissance of north-west Germany, but the photographs taken wereunfortunately unsuccessful owing to the freezing of thecamera.     Another photographic reconnaissance, the results ofwhich have not yet been received, was carried out on the 25thNovember;   the aircraft returned safely.Overseas Commands.16.   Reconnaissances and anti-submarine patrols havebeen undertaken by aircraft from the Mediterranean Command,and air escorts have been provided for ten convoys in theMediterranean area.Air action has been taken in the Aden Protectorateagainst local tribes who have been raiding caravan routesabout 150 miles from Aden.     0n the second day of theoperations, the crew of a forced-landed aircraft v/eremurdered by tribesmen.     Operations are still continuing.
