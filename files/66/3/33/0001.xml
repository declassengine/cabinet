THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MfiJESTVS GOVERNMENT     242TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It ir requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.O^11&apos; COFSBO. Af/L(MOjofisSLiSZ)wuv CABINET *The Foreign Offiae lias   asked for our views on themilitary implications of giving an assurance of support to the Scandinavian Countries in the event of aggressi**iaby Russia or Germany.2.        The War Cahinet will recall that a confidentialhut formal conminication   has already heen uade to theNorwegian authorities to the effect that:-&quot;His Hajesty&apos;s Government would regard a Gernan.attack on Norway as tantamount to an attackon this country.&quot;3.        Uore recently wo reported on the relative advantages and disadvantages which would accrue to us if, eitherformally or informally, we were to declare war on theU.S.S.R. as a result of Soviet aggression against FinlaiaS.or against any of the other Scandinavian Countries.     Oarconclusions in this report were to the effect that theprohlem of whether or not we should declare var on Rassiain these circurastances raised very wide iBsues, involvissH See telegram at Annex I, and also Paper no.V^P.fJ3S^7.Paper No. W.?.(39)107, also paper Ho.

the attitude of neutrals and in particular the attitudeof the U.S.A.     We and Prance alone were in no positionto undertake new commitments.     The War Cabinet endorsedthese views.4.        In that same papev, however, when discussing -haft*.military support 1. laight be possible to send to the scandinavian Countries, if we were forced to fight Russia,we expressed the following opinion:-&quot;4.     .7e could afford naval support to Norway in theevent of a Russian sea-borne expedition againstNarvik.     A land invasion wov.ld be a long and difficult operation for the Russians.    A small british force, say a Brigade Group, based on the narvik-Boden railway ana operating in support ofthe Norwegians and Swedes, might have an effectout of all proportion to its size.     Althoughcampaigning conditions in Scandinavia would beextremel;&apos;- arduous, the despatch of a smallexpedition -would be a practicable proposition,   Wecould, however, afford no assistance to Finlandagainst Russian aggression.11(Paper ifo. V/.P.(39)107, also Paper Ho.- C.0,S.(5J)10S, paragraph 5.)5.        \ie have since made a fur-her and more detailed examination into the possibility of despatching a small force to Scandinavia.     We have reached the conclusionthat it might be extremely difficult to limit our commitment and that, once British troops had landed in norway, a commitment of a small force might rapidly growinto something far larger.     While, therefore, we adhere toour view that the despatch of a small expedition would be practicable, on fuller examination we coipi&amp;er it would be undesirable and we are therefore unable to recommend it.6. Our views on the questions raised by the ForeignOffice are therefore as follows:-/  W.M.(39) 69th Conclusion, Minute 9.

(a) In view of the assurance which has alreadybeen given to Norway in respect of german aggression, it is for consideration whethera further conimznication should be made to theNorwegian Government explaining that theextent of our support must be limited to naval action-(b) That no assurance should be given to Sweden onthe question of German aggression.   any assistance we could render would be inherent inthe fact that we are already at war withGermany.(c) That no assurance should be given to anyScandinavian State as regards Russian aggression.(d) If we were already at war with Russia before shetook action against Scandinavia, or if we felt obliged on political grounds to go to war withRussia in consequence of her aggression in scandinavia, our assistance to the scandinavian countries must be limited to naval action forthe maintenance of Norwegian sea communications and the protection of that country againstRussian sea-borne attack.(Signed)   C.L.N.

A R N B X.(H 4218/0) I   \To NORWAY.Cypher telegram to Sir C. Dormer, (Oslo).Foreign Office, 11th September, 1939,   7.30 jp.nuNo. 50.Your telegram No. 46 ^of 5th September:   Norwegianattitude to British blockade measureg7.1.     You should inform Norwegian Government confidentiallybut formally that His Majesty&apos;s Government would regard aGerman attack on Norway as tantamount to an attack on thiscountry.2.     For your own information, Hia Majesty&apos;s government consider that in view of our naval superiority Germany would find it very difficult to attack lTorway effectively, and thatshe would also be chary of taking such a step owing to theprobable reactions in other Scandinavian countries and theneed for concentrating her forces elsewhere.     You should make use of these arguments in any informal conversations which you may have with the Norwegian authorities regarding the Germanreactions to Norwegian acquiescence in our blockade measuresor in the interruption of the iron ore trade with Grrmany viaNarvik.3.     Should the Norwegian authorities themselves raise thequestion of British assistance in the event of German air attacks on Norway, you should intimate that such assistancedould in the nature of things be indirect only.    You should however, endeavour to avoid discussing this point. .
