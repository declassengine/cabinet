gggJB copy boWEEKLY REPORT MO. 10 OF AIR OPBAND INTELLIGENCE: FOR WEEK ENDING- MIDHXSHS-       Bth N6vEMBERt ISaS.:GERMAN AIR FOBCBt1.      Bombers.    There has been little activity of theGerman bomber force during the week.    An unidentified bomberunit has been located in the Frankfurt area, and another knownto have been recently in Austria has now been identified onthe aerodrome at Crailshaim, west of Nuremberg,    Germanbomber units in the Baltic area continued their practiceagainst moving targets:   an additional bomber unit is knownto have taken part in this activity.2. Fighters. No information has been received to alter the general distribution, as estimated by the Air Staff, of theGerman fighter units, but there is a reliable report that a fewfighter and army co-operation units have moved from the ares ofAachen northwards to the district of Oldenburg.3.      Breaches of Neutrality.    There have again beeninstances of the violation of Belgian neutrality by german aircraft, mainly by those engaged on reconnaissance.Violations have taken place both on the outward and homewardjourneys.FRENCH AIR FORCE.4.      The French Air Force has been very active and numerous reconnaissances over German  territory have beenmade.    The German Air Force has been similarly active overFrench territory, and reconnaissance aircraft have appeared,for example, over Dunkirk, Lyons, Paris and Bourgea.    Someof these aircraft dropped leaflets.ROYAL AIR FORCE OPERATIONS.B0M3ER COMMAND.5.      Operations against the German Fleet.    A striking

force of bomber aircraft has been held ready to Attack vnits ofthe German Fleet, if any should be reported.    Additionally, with   1the object of attacking possible fortuitous targets, a sweep tobe made by from three to six bombers over a specified area inthe North Sea has been instituted.    Owing to unfavourable :weather conditions, only one such sweep has been made duringthe past week and no enemy vessels were encountered.6.      Beconnaissance of Heligoland.    As a result of anAdmiralty report indicating the possible presence of navalconcentrations near Heligoland three Blenheim aircraft were sent out at 11.15 a.m. on the 11th November to Investigate.The leader of the formation, who was the only one to return,reported that the weather grew worse as the reconnaissance aircraft flew east, until eventually the pilots were flyingat about 100 feet above the sea in conditions of poor visibility.At the estimated time of arrival over Heligoland, which was notin fact sighted, the formation broke up, and the leader did notagain see the accompanying aircraft.7.      On the night of the 10/llth November, four aircraft from France left to make a night reconnaissance over central and southern Germany, including the towns of Nuremberg and Munich.Three returned safely, but the fourth crashed and burnt oatsouth of Nancy and the five members of the crew were killed.The cause of the accident has not been determined, bat it ispossible that the pilot flew into the ground on the way home from the Munich area.8.      ,Ht Balloon (Leaflet Dropping) Pnittt    This unit hasoperated on five nights during the week, and a total of 2179balloons, each carrying 3,000 leaflets, have seen released.The winds, blowing mainly from the south-wesftg have been favourable for this type of operation and it is estimated thatthe area covered has extended to the approximate line Magdeburg-Wittenburg-Bresden-Gorlitz-Hirschberg:   it is possible therefore

thai acae of the leaflets have been scattered over parts Of the* protectorate8 of Bohemia.FIGHTER COTOHD.9.     Enemy Aircraft.    German aircraft were active over theNorth Sea during the-week, and as a result a total of 79 patrolsinvolving 235 aircraft were sent out from Fighter Commandstations:   no contacts, however, were made.    The particularsare briefly as follow:&quot;various plots of possible raiders were investigated by fighter aircraft on the 6th and 7th November, but no enemywereseen.    Doubtful tracks, and the reports of enemy air activity directed against tbe fishing fleet, were investigated by fighter patrols on the 8th November, and on the same day theEast bound convoy, which was reported to be followed by ashadowing aircraft, was escorted by fighters:   in neitherInstance was contact made with enemy aircraft.On the 9th November a section of Hurricanes fromManston was sent up to intercept three aircraft plotted off^Deal, but no enemy were found:   one of the Hurricanes left the? formation and was last seen going down through the clouds.The Hurricane did not return and a search patrol sent out by coastal Command found no trace of it.    Fighters sent up duringthe same day to patrol or to investigate various other plots of enemy aircraft made no contacts.A total of 27 fighter patrols were despatched inconsequence of the detection of four separate aircraft by theR.D.F. chain and by the Observer Corps on the 10th November.The first aircraft, which was first plotted at 9.22 a.m.heading south west off Lowestoft at 15,000 feet, went down theDover Straits and faded out at 9.55 a.m. south-east of Dungeness:there were heavy layers of cloud and our fighters did not sightthis aircraft.    The next track indicated one aircraft at 16,000feet at 9.28 a.m. off Cromer travelling at 230 m.p.h.     It

crossed the coast about midway between Cramer and Yarmouth,and appears to have gone by way of Windsor to Bristol andCardiff, on to Liverpool, and subsequently across England -toits exit on the East Coast at Middlesbrough.    Although squadrons-along the route sent up fighter patrols no interception wasmade:   during the flight the greater part of England was covered by clouds-0    Another aircraft was plotted at 9.51 a.m,about 80 miles east of Newcastle but fighters sent up to intercept failed to make contact.     Three aircraft detectedwell out to sea approaching the Kentish coast on the same daywere not found by our fighter patrols.Only one aircraft was detected on the 12th November.It was first plotted about fifty miles east of Fellxatowewhence it turned south and ultimately passed over the french coast at Cap Blanc Nez.    A fighter pilot from Mansion wentup through the clouds to intercept and saw what was thought to be an enemy aircraft at about 7,000 feet, but the enemy8if such it was, disappeared into the clouds and was notsubsequently seen.COASTAL COMMAND.10.     Though hampered by bad weather, routine patrols,searches, reconnaissances, the escort .of convoys, and anti-submarine patrols have been continued during the week.    Asa result merchant vessels, tankers, mines, sixteen aircraft,and two submarines were sighted.Both the U-boats which were sighted were attacked.In one instance the submarine appeared to be holding up a norwegian merchant vessel, but the U-boat submerged before the bombs were dropped.    With regard to the second submarine itis estimated that one of a stick of three bombs made a direct hit.Air escorts, involving a total of 140 aircraft, were provided for eighteen convoys.

Of the sixteen enemy aircraft sighted daring the weekseven were engaged and two of them shot down.    The particulars of these successful combats are as follows:-(i)   On the 8th November an Anson of No. 205 Squadron-   was pursued by a Heinkel 115 about fourty-fourmiles west of Terschelling.    The Anson pilotmade a vertical turn and as he did so theenemy tried to keep station on the tail of theAnson.     The Royal Air Force pilot increased the rate of his turn until he saw the enemy aircraft through his sights when he at onceopened fire:   meanwhile, fire had been openedfrom the rear gun in the Anson.    The Heinkelbroke up and fell in the sea where it sank,leaving floats and a parachute on the surfaceof the water.(ii)   On the 10th November three Hudson aircraftfound a Heinkel 115 about- seventy-five miles east of Spurn Head.    They pursued the enemy,but by making skilful use of the clouds theGerman pilot escaped.    During the encounterone of the British pilots lost sight of theother aircraft and returned home.     Theremaining two continued their patrol andsubsequently picked up a signal made by no. 18 Group, resulting from a telephone message received from the Headquarters of...    Coastal Command, which gave a directionfinding report of a German aircraft believed to he moving north west in the neighbourhood.The two Hudson pilots set a course to Intercept . -and found a Hornier 16 flying-boat in the area in which they had -expected to make the interception.     Both the Hudsons engaged the flying boat in which the rear gunner was hot almost at once.    After an engagementlasting about ten minutes the Dornierplunged steeply down and made a rough landing on the sea.     Immediately after alighting adinghy issued from the flying boat.    One ofthe Hudsons, in which bullets had cut someelectric cables and shattered the petrolgauge, returned, leaving the second Hudson 6-to watch the Dornier.&quot;    After a time theDornier flying boat heeled over and sank,and three of the crew took to the dinghy,A second Dornier 18 arrived on the sceneand was engaged by the Hudson which droveit off with some good bursts of fire:   1%was last seen disappearing into the clouds.ADVANCED AIR;STBIKING FORCE.11,    Arrangements continue in being by which the squadrons of the Second Echelon will be able to move to France withinfourteen days of a decision being taken.Fighter aircraft assigned to the Advanced Air striking force made a number of patrols during the week.    On the 6th .

Hovember a Hurricane fighter which was about to attack aGerman Heinkel reconnaissance aircraft over the German lineswas attacked by nine Messerschmidt fighters s   he found no great difficulty In eluding them although ten bullets holeswere discovered in the tail when the Hurridane landed.    On&apos;the 8th November two Hurricane fighters on intercepter patrolsaw two German reconnaissance aircraft at 27,000 ft. underfire from anti-aircraft guns.    One of them, a Dornier 17, wasovertaken and shot down:   it crashed and the occupants were found dead.    The second reconnaissance aircraft was alsoengaged and the Hurricane pilot believes he disabled theenemy:   French ground, observers reported that this aircraft was last seen in a steep dive near the German lines.Unfortunately, the pilot of the Hurricane in this encounterlanded at Esch, on the Luxembourg side of the French frontier,in the mistaken impression that he was in France:   he has been interned.ROYAL AIR FORCE COKPONENT OF THE BRITISH EXPEDITIONARY FORCE.12.    Fighters.     It was decided on the 10th November, asa precautionary measure, to move two additional squadrons toFrance;   the servicing unit for the reception of these squadronshas been in France ready against such an emergency.    Owing toadverse weather the squadrons have not yet flown across.Fighter patrols have been carried out daily in Franceduring the week, bat no interceptions have been reported.     Onthe 10th November a Hurricane aircraft which flew away from a formation in order to investigate an unidentified aircraft.,made a forced landing in Belgium.Bombers.    On the 6th November five Blenheim aircraft,one of which failed, to return, made a successful reconnaissance of the Siegfried Line and of north west Germany.     150photographs of the Line were taken and many others of townsand. aerodromes in the specific area in Germany.    Photographs

mwere also taken of a balloon barrage, which was in the form ofa ring, north west of Hheine0    An additional reconnaissancewas made by six aircraft on the 7th November, but owing toclouds the results were meagre?   one of the aircraft failed toreturn?ARMY C^operation-IS.    The squadrons of the two Army Co-operation Wings have continued to photograph the area of the 3*1*4*1* Exp^di-fcianaryForce, and have been   engages, la. training.
