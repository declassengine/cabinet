It was agreed to invite theFrench to communicate forthwith the views held by their High Command on thissubject.2. Subsequently, on the 30th November, t the War Cabinet considered our report on the Strategical Situation in South-East Europe with particular reference to the activities of General Weygand (Paper No. W.P. (39) 142), whenit was agreed to invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to instruct HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris to suggest to the French Government in the mosttactful way that they should take steps to ensure that there should be no departure from the policy in regard to the Balkans, which had been agreed between the twoGovernments.3. We have to-day completed a review of what we consider should be our military policy in the Middle East. This has been circulated to the Cabinet asPaper No. W.P. (39) 148, but has not yet been discussed by them. We have also received the views of the French High Command, and these are attached to thisMemorandum (Annex), together with our comments thereon.4. It will be seen that there are certain important divergences of opinion between the French High Command and ourselves. We therefore desire guidancefrom the War Cabinet before proceeding to Paris to discuss the whole problem with General Gamelin.French Policy.5. The French are in favour of a forward policy in the Balkans! Theyanticipate that events may render the presence of an allied expeditionary forcein the Balkans necessary as early as next Spring. They therefore advocateimmediate negotiations, which are to be completed by the end of this year or theearly days of 1940. They appear to ignore the political dangers to which we referbelow in paragraphs 9 and 10.  They also ignore the administrative difficulties* .W.M. (39) 95th Conclusions, Minute 5.t W.M.

Nor have we thought it right, from the military point of view, to press Turkey to declare herself too openlyat this stage.Military Considerations.7. Our views on our military policy in the Middle East are set out at some length in Paper No. W.P. (39) 148. Broadly speaking, we propose a limitedreinforcement of Egypt and Palestine&apos; and the development of administrativefacilities in those countries and in India, so as to allow the concentration ofadditional forces, should the situation demand. This is a long-term policy andwill take many months to complete, and we certainly never contemplated an earlyconcentration of Franco-British Forces in Thrace or Anatolia. All that we hadin mind was that the Turks should be pressed to develop their communications,ports and aerodromes. Even without formal staff conversations with the Turksit might be possible to secure the preparation of these administrative facilities.8. The military considerations affecting the despatch of forces to the balkans were summarised in our Report to the War Cabinet (Paper No.W.P. (39) 142) as follows :----I &quot; 12. We desire to emphasise that, from the military point of view, wef    are at present in no position to undertake any adventures in the Balkans.The over-riding consideration of Italy&apos;s neutrality has not yet been achieved.I The administrative facilities required for the operation of large forces in this theatre are at present totally lacking, and would- require development on alarge scale, while the strain which the maintenance of these forces would impose on our resources of shipping would be very heavy. Any commitmentonce started would inevitably grow; and in this connection it must beremembered that any diversion of force to the Middle East must result in acorresponding diminution of our military effort in France. This is a point which no doubt the French Government would be quick to appreciate.&quot;&apos;The Political A speet.9. From the political point of view we consider that the French policy isequally dangerous. Italy is slowly, but unmistakably, moving in the right direction. Turkey, although nervous of her military position and of her relationswith Russia, has so far encouraged us to think that she would come in with usin the event of a serious threat to our joint interests in the Middle East. Theother Balkan Powers, though nervous and restless, show no particular desire toenter the lists on one side or the other.10. In our view, overt preparation for the despatch of a military expeditionto Turkey would cause violent political repercussions in the Balkans and in theMiddle East. First it would be necessary to press the Turks for immediate staff conversations, which would be most unwelcome to them. Secondly, such action would probably give rise to grave suspicions in Italian minds. Our misgivingsseem to be shared by M. Daladier, as is shown by the following extract from areport of a conversation which he had with Sir Percy Loraine (vide Rometelegram No. 367, Saving): &quot; &quot; If Germany attacked Hungary and Italy went to the aid of Hungary,Italy would, ipso facto, be coming into the war on our side. If, on the otherhand, the Allies had made prior military preparation which Italy might regard as contrary to her policy of preventing the extension of war to the balkan area and to the Mediterranean, there was a clear risk of our drivingItaly into the arms of Germany. All in all. therefore, I felt myself that thecase was one in which political considerations ought to take precedence ofmilitary considerations. M. Daladier said he thought I was probably right.&quot;
11. It is true that if Germany or Russia in the near future made a sudden &quot;descent into South-East Europe we could not stand by and do nothing. Indeed,if Turkey considered her vital interests to be threatened, we should be boundto intervene on her behalf. In these circumstances we would, of course, have todo our best, but our assistance would perforce be limited, for the military reasonsset out in paragraphs 7 and 8 above, to the supply of such material and technicalunits as we could spare and the despatch of a small token force if the Turksshould ask for it.The Suspense Clause in the Anglo-French-Turkish Treaty.12. There is one final point to which we invite attention. One of the objec-tives of the visit of the Turkish Secretary-General to this country is to dispose ofthe Suspense Clause in the special agreement between Great Britain, France and turkey. In virtue of this Clause Turkey cannot be called upon to fulfil herengagements under the Treaty until she has received delivery of the armamentsof which she is in urgent need, particularly anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns.13. We have already agreed to make a substantial allocation to Turkey of anti-aircraft guns, which, in view of our own needs, we cannot recommend shouldbe increased. As regards anti-tank guns, there is a very grave shortage of these weapons for our own army. Moreover, new supplies are not, as yet, coming alongin large quantities. In these circumstances, we are unable to meet the Turkishdemands, and we feel that, even if this means that the Suspense Clause must remain in operation, we should in present circumstances refuse to release to theTurks any further equipments of a type which we so badly need ourselves.14. If, however, a heavy attack developed in South-East Europe, it mightbe thought right to transfer some of the equipments which Turkey and we ourselves so badly need from the Western Front to Thrace. A decision on this could only be made in the light of circumstances.Conclusion.15. The French have asked that discussions on Anglo-French military policy in the Balkans should be undertaken in Paris at the earliest possible moment they even suggested Monday, the 4th December, as the opening day.General Gamelin himself proposes to take part in the discussions; and general weygand. who is now in Paris, will doubtless also be present. In these circum-stances, we have agreed to go to Paris ourselves at an early date probably nextMonday. We therefore ask for the guidance of the War Cabinet as to the line we are to take, with particular reference to the apparent divergence of opinion between the French High Command and ourselves, as summarised inparagraphs 5, 6, 9 and 10 above.(Signed)        C.

ANNEXANGLO-FRENCH POLICY IN THEMIDDLE EAST20133C
TRANSLATION OF MEMORANDA BY THE FRENCH.Note dated November 30 by the French Delegation in London.(Paper No. DF. 47a-)AT their last meeting the Supreme War Council decided that the military experts should resume consideration of problems arising in the Balkans.Since that date, the French Government have been led to the view that steps should be taken at an early date to ensure that the Allies shall not be taken bysurprise by events, should Germany or Russia seek to bring about a political orstrategical modification of the present balance in the Middle East.Since document MR. (J.) (39) 8 was issued on the 30th September thesituation has altered considerably as a consequence of the expansionist policy adopted by the U.S.S.R. and of the signature of the Anglo-Franco-turkish treaty. It is therefore very desirable that the Permanent Military Representa-tives should resume their consideration of Allied intervention in the Balkans.See The policy contemplated by the French Government consists in essence ineumment l. a detailed preparation forthwith of all the steps involved in the despatch of aFranco-British Expeditionary Force to Thrace or Anatolia, in such a manner that this force can be installed there before any German or Russian threat arises in the Balkans.We attach to this note:(1) A memorandum stating the general view of the French authorities;(2) A statement of military data likely to assist in a systematic study ofthe question; this statement is in no sense limitative and furthersuggestions will be welcomed;(3) Proposals regarding the conclusions which it is thought might beadopted.TRANSLATION OF A MEMORANDUM DATED NOVEMBER 30 stating the GENERAL VIEW OF THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES.(Paper No. DF. 47b.)Memorandum.THE High Command of the French Land, Naval and Air Forces have considered the question of Allied military intervention in the Balkans and theNear East and have reached the following conclusions: I. The western area of operations, comprising the land front in Franceand Belgium, the North Sea and the North Atlantic,-must remain the principalarea of operations.The forces available to the Allies next spring on land, at sea and in theair, will not be sufficient to allow of the diversion of considerable effectives to the balkans or the Near East.*Sea transport facilities will also be insufficient to permit of any large-scale operations.Hence the objectives of the Allies in those areas, at any rate in the initialstage, must remain limited ones and must pay due regard to the pursuit of their primary aims.* It does not appear likely that the Allies will have a numerical superiority on the western front by next Spring. . .-
COMMENTS BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF ON THE MEMORANDA BYTHE FRENCH.Comment 1.The French are contemplating the preparation of plans for the despatchof a Franco-British Expeditionary Force to Thrace or Anatolia, in such a manner that this force &quot;can be installed there before any German or Russian threatarises in the Balkans &quot;Such a proposal appears to us to be tantamount to an attempt to precipitatewar in the Balkans, whereas we have always favoured the maintenance of a neutral Balkan bloc which would be supported by Italy. There is therefore a fundamental divergence of principle between ourselves and the French in thewhole of the Paper under consideration, which raises questions of the veryhighest policy.[-20422 j
In the light of the present general political situation, those limited objectivescan be defined as barring German and Russian access to the Straits and the-(aegean, one the one hand, and possibly to the Persian Gulf, on the other.See Only if Italy should join the Allies or give full and complete assurances(omment 2. of benevolent neutrality could the forces to be used in the Balkans and the near east be increased, and our objectives there correspondingly extended, withoutputting into question the prior claim of the Western Front.II. The position of Yugoslavia if attacked by Germany, and that of roumania if attacked by Germany or Russia, would be greatly improved ifBulgaria adopted an attitude of genuine and permanent neutrality.Similarly the prospects of Allied including Turkey action would be greatly enhanced if Bulgaria was on our side: cover for the Straits and the coasts of the jEgean could then be provided much further North, whileRoumania&apos;s resistance could more easily be stiffened. Every possible effort should therefore be made to secure at least the benevolent neutrality of Bulgaria.See III.   The benevolent ueutrality of Italy would render it easy to transportjomment3. an(j SUppiy the Allied Expeditionary Force in the Balkans. Yugoslavia couldbe supplied through the harbours on the Dalmatian Coast. The hostility ofItaly, on the contrary, would rule out any possibility of Allied intervention basedupon the home country or upon North Africa, and practical assistance to Turkeycould in that event only be organised using Egypt or the over-land route acrossAsia Minor as a base.The participation of Italy as an Ally would open up the widest strategicalprospects for successful action in the Balkans.IV. Such being the main principles to be taken into account, the detailsof the contemplated Franco-British action will be governed by the severalhypotheses regarding enemy aggression in the Balkans and the Near East, whichthe course of events will in due course make clear.See In the existing circumstances, the French High Command considers thatnmment 6- Thrace would provide the most effective base for the Expeditionary Force. Hencewe should endeavour forthwith to obtain the approval of our Turkish Allies tothe organisation in Thrace and Anatolia of the facilities required for the rapidinstallation of Allied forces. The French High Command holds the view thatthe general course of events may render the actual presence of an ExpeditionaryForce in the Balkans necessary as early as next spring.See At the same time it is realised that it might well be desirable, as a measuretomment 6. 0f security, to land an Allied force at Salon ica in order to deny the enemy access to the uEgean. It is, therefore, thought that consideration should be given tothe number of effectives which should be reserved for this particular purpose,and to the most suitable place where such reserves can be maintained.See V.   The French High Command believe that all studies and negotiations inKunment 7,   this connection should be completed by the end of the year or the early days of1940.  It is, they believe, necessary that the Allies should be in a position toproceed to the active stage in January and not later, if they are to be enabled to&quot;face a German or German-Soviet offensive in the Balkans next spring.
Comment 2. ..This reference to the possibility of increasing the forces to be used in the balkans and the Near East, if Italy should join the Allies or give full and complete assurances of benevolent neutrality, is misleading. In point of fact theseare the only circumstances in which any forces (other that a few specialist unitsor a small token force) are likely to be despatched.Comment 3.The statement that &quot; the benevolent neutrality of Italy would render iteasy to transport and supply the Allied Expeditionary Force in the Balkans &quot;seems unduly optimistic. It disregards the difficulties of maintaining such forces by sea and the very limited capacity of the Anatolian railways. Moreover, even with a benevolently neutral Italy, some increase in our present light naval forcesin the Mediterranean would be necessary to secure the communications of a Balkanexpeditionary force. These increases could only be provided at the cost ofdepleting our security in home waters.Comment 4.The participation of Italy as an ally would open up the possibility of a campaign on the line Trieste-Vienna, which would be a much shorter route toGermany and easier in every way than any operations based in the southernBalkansComment 5.The administrative difficulties inherent in the maintenance of Allied forces in thrace are dealt with in paragraph 8 of the Annex to Paper No. C.O.S. (39) 146.*It is questionable whether the very limited communications available would suffice for anything more than the Turkish forces destined for the defence of theThracian frontier. The most they could support in addition would probablybe certain specialist units and perhaps a small token Allied force.Comment 6.The considerations relating to the despatch of a force to Salonica and tothe defence of Greece in general are dealt with in paragraphs 4 and 13-18 ofthe Annex to Paper No. C.O.S. (39) 146.Comment 7.The precise implication of the phrase &quot; to proceed to the active stage inJanuary is not clear. Even if we accept the French proposal to press forward with planning, the active steps which could be taken in collaboration with greece and Turkey must depend on the result of diplomatic negotiations. The Turkshave shown themselves most unwilling to enter into detailed Staff conversations,and the Chiefs of Staff have already advised against Staff conversations with greece, in view of the danger of jeopardising the maintenance of Italian* Also circulated as Paper No. W.P.

ftTRANSLATION OF A STATEMENT OF THE FRENCH POINT OFVIEW, FOR DISCUSSION BY THE PERMANENT military representatives (DATED NOVEMBER 30).(Paper No. DJF. 47c.)The organisation of a Balkan front raises a certain number of questions-which can be classified under the following heads: A. Purposes of and general conditions governing military intervention by france and Great Britain in the Balkans;B. Means available, immediately and subsequently;C. Points at which the Franco-British forces can be applied;D. Conditions governing the gathering, transport and installation of theforces;E. Allocation of tasks as between the French and British on the one hand,and as between both and their Balkan allies on the other hand;F. Negotiations to be initiated with Turkey, and possibly other countries,in connection with the proposed operations.A. Purposes of and General Conditions governing Military Intervention by france and Great Britain in the Balkans.(a) Objectives to be attained.(1) General Objective. To prevent Germany or Russia from upsetting totheir advantage the strategic, political and economic balance at present obtainingin the Balkans;See (2) In any event, to keep the Straits in the hands of the Anglo-Franco-ament 8,   Turkish Coalition and to deny the enemy access to the JEgeaa;(3) // possible, to aid and assist Roumania, and in certain circumstancesYugoslavia, with the following aims in view: Firstly, to prevent Germany from gaining access to the mineral and agricultural resources of those two countries;and secondly, to keep the Rumanian and Yugo-Slav armies in fightingcondition, thereby compelling Germany to earmark part of her forces to the holding of the Rumanian-Yugo-Slav front set up against her.See (4) Eventually, and if Soviet action should constitute a threat in thenment 9. direction of Iraq and the Persian Gulf, to retain a possibility of impinging uponthe freedom of decision and action of the U.S.S.R. by exerting a threat onthe oil-producing area of the Russian Caucasus by sea, in the air and by land(N.B. Batoum is only 25 kilometres from the Turkish frontier).(b) General Conditions governing Military Intervention.(1) The proposed intervention must be Franco-British in character.(2) Its details must be settled without delay if we agree that we most be onthe spot by next spring.(3) It must be carried out with sufficient resources to ensure that with due regard to such,Balkan Powers as may be on our side the minimum objective,namely, the preservation of the Straits, can be attained.(4) The expeditionary forces must be brought together, transported, landed,maintained and supplied under conditions offering the required degree of safety.This leads&apos; us to consider the Italian factor, and hence to examine the two following hypotheses :-Italy doubtful (as at present) or hostile;Italy giving reliable assurances of neutrality.
Comment 8.It is suggested that this objective would be more correctly worded asfollows: &quot; To keep the Straits in the hands of the Anglo-Franco-Turkishcoalition in any event, and, if possible, to deny the enemy access to the aegean.&quot;This would accord more closely with paragraph (b) (3) below, and would bein line with our own views.Comment 9.It is possible that the translation of the French word &quot; eventuellement &quot;as &quot;eventually&quot; may be misleading and would be more properly &quot;if circum-stances should permit.&quot; The possibility of attacking the Caucasian oilfields is discussed in paragraph 21 of the Annex to Paper No. C.O.S. (39) 146. It wouldbe our intention to attack these objectives as early as possible after the entry ofRussia into the war on the side of our enemies.
Set (5) The Staff conversations of last September, which led to the issue ofI comment 10. document M.E. (J.) (39) 8, brought into relief the difficulties of any action in the balkans should Italy be hostile. On the other hand, the Anglo-Franco-turkish treaty and Military Convention were initiated under the assumption of hostilityon the&quot; part of Italy and Bulgaria, and it is provided that, should this assumptionmaterialise, French forces limited in numbers would be landed and Alliedattack be made on the Dodecanese. It, therefore, appears desirable to undertake a fresh study of the question with the object of defining the line to be followed in the event of Italian hostility. There are the following alternatives: A campaign may be initiated against Italy with the object of puttingher out of action in the first place;or action can be confined to the Dodecanese;or the action considered appropriate in the Balkans can be carried out,notwithstanding the attitude of Italy.B. Means A vailable Immediately and Subsequently.(a) // Italy is doubtful or hostile (1) Means available at once would be 3 French divisions, together with certain effectives from the general reserve in the Levant;British forces (numbers to be established) from Palestine and Egypt.Document M.R. (J.) (39) 8 drew attention to the difficulties the British .would meet in reducing their Palestine and Egyptian effectives in the hypothesisnow under consideration. Reinforcements since dispatched to the Near East, andthe improvement of the defensive organisation, should by now have renderedcertain sacrifices possible in the interests of the front in Thrace, in view of theimportance of the latter.(2) Subsequently, subject to adequate supply arrangements: -1 or 2 Anzae Divisions and 1 or 2 Colonial Divisions from Indo-China.(3) The above forces will have to be supplemented without delay with Fighter and Bomber Aircraft,A.A. equipment,Armoured vehicles, .Anti-tank equipment.Seacomment 11.Seecomment 12,See (4) Arrangements will have to be made on the spot for the supply of stores,comment 18. ammunition and food for a period of six months (N.B. supplies for 3-4 months have already been accumulated in the Middle East and Egypt).(b) If Italy is neutral and we have full freedom of action in the Mediterranean; (1) The means available at once could be increased by the addition of . Certain French effectives (2 or perhaps 3 infantry divisions with 2 or3 tank battalions) from French North Africa or perhaps the metropolitanterritory.See British reinforcements drawn from Palestine and egypt, bringing upcomment 14. to a minimum of 1-J infantry divisions and 1 armoured division of 5 tankbattalions* the total land strength of the British part of the ExpeditionaryForce.(2) The means subsequently available might be increased by the addition of3 or 4 Polish and Czech Divisions provided the Governments agree.(N.B. This would depend upon the attitude of Yugo-Slavia.)* The 3 cavalry regiments being reckoned as 3 light tank battalions.
Comment 10.P*f%*ph deals with action in the Balkans in the event of Italianflinty are dealt with in detail m paragraphs 25-34 of the Annex to PaperStitade&apos;of ffiv^/rtf^-1?4^ aCt^0V? the Balkans &apos;&apos;notwithstandingXattitude of Italy   (the third alternative) is entirely contrary to our ideasTComment 11.The movement by sea of any troops in the eastern Mediterranean would be out of the question until the Italian threat had been liquidated. We do not agree,therefore, that it would be possible to despatch British and French forces in the initial stages if Italy were hostile. &apos;Reference is made in this paragraph to British reinforcements despatched to the Near East since Paper No. M.R. (J.) (39) 8 was drawn up. This is incorrect,since these reinforcements are limited to the despatch of a few anti-aircrafttroops.Comment 12.We have not the resources available to despatch fighter and bomber aircraft and armoured fighting vehicles. Anti-aircraft and anti-tank equipment is, however, the most pressing need of the Turks, and on its supply depends to alarge extent the implementation of the Anglo-Turkish Treaty. particular reference was made to these weapons by M. Menemenjoglu in his recentconversation with the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.* The French papercontemplates that it would be sent to Turkey after the despatch of the forcesreferred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.Comment 13.We agree that six months&apos; reserves of stores, ammunition and food wouldbe desirable. At the present time the building up of three to four months&apos; reserves in the Middle East and Egypt has not yet been completed and, owing to theshortage of equipment, is not likely to be completed for many months.Comment 14.The French assumption as to the number of British divisions which couldbe made available is in accord with the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staffin Paper No. CCS. (39) 94, but it.should be noted that these recommendations were made on the assumption that Italian neutrality was assured beyond allpossible doubt; they have not yet received the approval of the War Cabinet.[20422]* CCS. (39) 140.
uSee (3) As under the first hypothesis, the above forces would require immediatetomment 15. strengthening by the addition of aircraft, AA. equipment, tanks and,i : anti-tank equipment ;&quot;.   . .. .       &apos;.&quot;C. Points at which the Fritnco-British Forces can be applied.Bee (a) In the initial stage, subject to the concurrence of Turkey and Greece,iiimments 16 these points might be: I   and 17. r &amp;(1) The Adrianople area, reached through IstambuL or(2) The Salonica area, or(3) Both.The means immediately available will not allow of simultaneous landings at salonica and Istambul. A choice must therefore be made between the two.Both places provide the same degree of facilities for the landing of an expeditionary Force, and transportation from the points of embarkation to either of these two ports could be effected in very similar conditions (see below).(b) The French Government and High Gommand favour Istambul, for thetomment 18. following reasons: (1) A landing of Franco-British forces in Turkish Thrace would be less likely to alarm Italy, since it would fit into the framework of Anglo-: Franco-Turkish collaboration.  A landing at Saionica would be quiteanother matter, and could only be justified from the political andmilitary standpoints if Italy or Germany threatened to force their way to the JEgean through Yugoslavia, Greece or Bulgaria.(2) A landing of Franco-British forces in Turkish Thrace rather than at salonica can be justified by reference to the rearming of Bulgaria,which Germany is now converting into an armed fortress, and to the pressure Russia is now exerting on Bulgaria.It will be easier to oppose Bulgarian action from Turkish Thracethan from Salonica.(3) A landing in Turkish Thrace can also be justified from the franco-British point of view by reference to the necessity for taking a firmhold of Turkey and of securing freedom of action in the Black Seathrough the possession and free use of the Straits.(4) Again, a landing in Turkish Thrace can be justified in the light ofour undertaking to assist Roumania.(5) Finally, and above all. it will be justified by the degree of security it will afford to our Expeditionary Force. That Force will be a limited one,at all events in the initial stage, and even with the addition of someGreek Divisions, would not be sufficient to provide for the defence ofSalonica should Italy cut our Mediterranean lines of communicationSee and make further reinforcement impossible.  The situation would becomment 19. quite different in Turkish Thrace, where the Franco-British forces would be integrated into a Turkish organisation which is already welldeveloped, close-knit, coherent, solid, buttressed by natural defensivefeatures and provided with overland lines of supply.(c) Although the French Government and High Command have, in theexisting circumstances, selected Turkish Thrace as their first choice, they are not see       unaware of the desirability of despatching an Expeditionary Force to Salonicacomment 20. should circumstances change, e.g., if Italy became hostile or if Germany invadedYugoslavia. In such a case, it would become necessary to investigate the character and details of Allied intervention with due regard to the forces at our disposal in turkish Thrace, Syria, Palestine and Egypt.
SBComment 15.The provision of additional aircraft, anti-aircraft equipment, tanks and anti-tank equipment would depend on the situation on the Western Front.Comment 1%.It is true that both Istanbul and Salonica &quot; provide the same degree of facilities for the landing of an Expeditionary Force,&quot; but these facilities are equally limited in both places. The bases available and the communicationsleading inland from both ports are equally restricted, and form the limiting factorfor a force of any size operating up country.Comment 17.A point to which the French do not appear to have given sufficient attention is the vital importance of ensuring adequate air support if troops are to be putinto Thrace (see paragraphs 7 and 8 of Annex to Paper No. C.O.S. (39) 146).Comment 18.The considerations set out in these paragraphs are mainly political in character. Any idea of intervention purely on the grounds of the rearming of bulgaria would be contrary to our general policy. We assume that the reference in paragraph (3) to &quot; the necessity for taking a firm hold of Turkey &quot; does not imply any idea of forcing the hand of the Turks by sending troops to Thracewithout an invitation from the Turkish Government, but the point should be cleared up with the French. -&apos;In general we agree that it would be better to despatch forces to Turkeyrather than to Salonica, but we hold the view that the premature despatch of aaAllied Expeditionary Force to Thrace would be a most hazardous proceeding.We, therefore, recommend that, should a threat to Turkey develop in the nearfuture, Allied assistance in Thrace should be strictly limited, and that we should support the Turks in Anatolia rather than Thrace, should they be driven backacross the Bcsphorus.  (Paper No. C.O.S. (39) 146, Annex, paragraphs 7 and 8.)Comment 19.The last sentence of this paragraph states that in Turkish Thrace &quot;the franco-British forces would be integrated into a Turkish organisation.&quot; Itis not clear whether the French envisage a Turkish Commander-in-Chief forthe Anglo-Franco-Turkish forces, but the Chiefs of Staff have already expressedthe view that any such arrangement would be quite unacceptable (vide PaperNo. C.O.S. (39) 94, paragraph 22). /*Comment 20. - --&apos;From our examination of the problem of the defence of Salonica in para-graphs 14-17 of Paper No. C.O.S. (39) 146, in which we reached the conclusionthat a minimum of 20 to 24 divisions would be required against a determinedadvance through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, it is clear that even if Italy remainedneutral we are unlikely to have sufficient forces available to hold Salonica. if italy became hostile the maintenance of an adequate force at Salonica wouldbe impossible until she had been defeated.[20422] d 2
D. Conditions Governing the Gathering, Transport and Installation of theForces.(a) Questions connected with the bringing together and conveyance by sea and land of the Expeditionary Force are being studied by the General Staff; theresults will be communicated to our British colleagues in due course. Theyindicate:  . -S*e (1) That the transport to Thrace by sea of an Expeditionary Force consistingr   &apos; of four Divisions and the appropriate supplies would occupy some two months and call for the use of some 300,000 tons gross;(2) That the transport to Thrace overland (i.e., by the Anatolian Railways)of a similar force, on the assumption that Italy was hostile and thattransport by sea was unsafe, would occupy an appreciably longer period and would necessitate considerable additions to the rollmg-stock(both locomotives and wagons) in the territories under FrenchMandate.(3) That in the case of sea transport, harbour equipment in the French Levantwould be inadequate and that use would have to be made of the harbours of Beirut, Tripoli and Haifa.(6) The landing of an Expeditionary Force in Turkish Thrace presupposesthe earmarking for Allied use of part of the harbour installations at Istanbuland the Turkish base of Ismid.(c) The maintenance of an Expeditionary Force in Thrace and Anatolia willrequire detailed arrangements with the Turks. There would be considerabledifficulty in keeping substantial French and British forces in Thrace during thewinter, but it would appear that the Valley of the Sakaria affords facilities forcamps, &amp;c., which should be investigated forthwith.E. Allocation of^Tasks as between the French and British on the one Hand!and as between both and their Balkan Allies on the other Hand.(a) The allocation of tasks between British and French is already providedfor in part under existing agreements. Thus (1) A pre-war agreement lays down that the Eastern Mediterranean fallswithin the sphere of the British Navy;See (2) The Anglo-Franco-Turkish Military Convention provides, under article 3,comment 23. that the three signatory countries shall co-operate in the capturewithin the shortest possible time of the Italian islands in the dodecanese. The same article goes on to say that the Frenchcontribution is to include air formations withdrawn from Syria, forthe use of which bases are to be provided on Turkish soil beforehostilities break out.(b) This allocation of tasks must be completed after due examination of thepossibilities of action on the British and French sides in the Near East.The French High Command consider ;&apos; (1) That the sea transport of the Expeditionary Force must be provided forby both British and French means;...(2) That the task of ensuring the safety of this transport falls, under&apos; theterms of existing agreements, to the British;See - (3) That the air and AA. equipment of the Expeditionary Force must becomment 24. provided for the greater part by the British, while the French will on n - their side provide the major part of the land forces and of the anti-tank equipment.
itComment 21. . ,We think the French underestimate the importance of shipping which wehave inferred (paragraph 21 of C.O.S. (39) 146) might very well be a limiting factor. This question will require much detailed examination at the appropriatestage.Comment 22.The landing of an Expeditionary Force and its subsequent maintenance,whether it be in Thrace or in Anatolia, are obviously questions which wouldrequire to be discussed with the Turks in the greatest of detail. It would bedifficult to conceal such conversations from the Italians and the Germans.Comment 23. -In point of fact, Article 3 of the Turkish Convention makes no provisionfor the capture of the Dodecanese &quot; within the shortest possible time.&quot; On theother hand, the development of aerodromes which would be required for this operation is equally necessary for any operations in support of the Turks in thrace or in Anatolia.        *Comment 24.While we agree that the provision of this equipment would be essential, if italy is hostile no such equipment would be available, and even if she werefriendly it can only be provided at the expense of our security on the western front, of the defence of the United Kingdom, or to a lesser degree of overseasports.
Seeeimtxient 25.TRANSLATIONS OF DRAFT RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED%Y THEFRENCH DELEGATION IN LONDON.(Paper No. D.F. 47d.)The French Delegation submits the following Resolutions: 1. Suggested Time Limits.The object in view is to place the Allies in a position to take action in the balkans next Spring with the object at least of supporting Turkey against any german or Russian undertaking.For this purpose it will be necessary to begin the concrete preparatoryoperations at the end of January 1940.Consequently the studies and negotiations must be concluded by the end ofthe year or the first days of next January.&apos;-- &apos;&apos;- &apos;        .2. Extent of proposed intervention.Bee This will depend upon the Italian attitude; in view of the provisions of thement 27. new Treaty, however, we cannot abandon Turkey to her own resources even if italy becomes hostile.(c) As to the allocation of tasks between the Franco-British forces and theirBalkan Allies, the question should be studied in the light of: (1) The general strategical problem.(2) The tactical considerations governing the use of the various Alliedcontingents.A joint plan of operations should be drawn up as soon as possible and at the latestby the 1st February, 1940, by the French, British and Turkish General Staffs,F. Negotiations to be initiated with Turkey, and possibly other -countries, .in connection with proposed operations..These negotiations should be conducted in the light of the following considerations: See ::- (1) It is essential (as Article 2 of the Special Anglo-Franco-Turkishment 26- Agreement states) that Turkey should without delay be placed in aposition in which she can effectively resist any attack which maymaterialise very shortly against her European frontier or againstthe Straits. Hence a joint plan of action must be prepared and an inter-Allied Command must be created.(2) A considerable period will be required to transport an ExpeditionaryForce consisting of four or five Divisions to Turkish Thrace and toplace it in position. *. (3) It will be necessary to make the fullest possible use of the AnatolianRailways in order to reduce the extent of sea transport and itsaccompanying risks; for that purpose: Reserves of equipment, ammunition and food must be constituted forthwith, both in Thrace and Anatolia;Camp areas must be organised without delay;Naval bases as well as the means of communication requiredmust be equipped;Bases must be organised and equipped for the mobileformations of the British and French Air Forces, which the twocountries will only be able to withdraw at the last moment fromtheir metropolitan territories.
&quot; &apos; * -&apos; &apos; ;    *      &quot;Comment 25. . .... . t   ; -..We agree that the preparation of a joint plan of operations at an early date would be desirable, but this again is dependent upon the withdrawal of thesuspensive clause to the Treaty, and the ultimate decision of the War Cabinet toauthorise Staff Conversations with the Turks. &apos;Comment 2b.This emphasises the necessity for providing the Turks with sufficient equip-ment to enable them to hold their Thracian frontier. On the other hand, it isclear that this equipment is not at present available and cannot be provided bynext spring. The Turks should, however, press on with the training of personnelso that they can handle the equipment when it does arrive.Comment 27.We have clearly pointed out (Annex to Paper No. COS. (39) 146), para-graph 27) that if Italy is hostile we can afford no direct support to Turkey orGreece.
Beecomment 28.It will be necessary to determine whether, in the event of Italian -hostility,the object should be &apos;--&apos;- -    - -. To attempt to put her out of action at once, or, &apos; .      &apos;&apos;...&apos;&quot;)&apos;,To drive her out of the Dodecanese only, or, &quot; &quot;To proceed with the proposed action in the Balkans notwithstandingItalian hostility, in which case the problem of sea transport, with a fulleruse in consequence of the Anatolian railways, would arise.3. Point at which the Allied Forces should be applied.This should be Istanbul and Thrace rather than Salonika, but the latter point may nevertheless be used for subsidiary purposes in certain circumstances.Transport to Thrace.4. The transport of an Expeditionary Force to Thrace whether by landor sea, or both, will require lengthy preparation.In the first place a plan of action will have to be agreed to with the Turkswith the object of defining the areas to which the Expeditionary Force is to be conveyed, the lines of communication to be used, the bases for supplies, &amp;c., andthe resources available on the spot. The next stage will consist of work forthe improvement of transport facilities, the supplying of camp areas,&apos; the mobilisation of local resources and the accumulation at the selected bases ofsupplies and the various forms of equipment required.5. Consideration should be given to the possible placing of the Expedi-tionary Force in the Winter in an area with a less unfavourable climate thanthat of Thrace, e.g., the valley of the Sikaria.6. The allocation of tasks as between the French and British Forces is governed by the existing agreements, which will require completion in accordancewith the following main principles : Sea transport to be provided jointly by France and Great Britain.The protection of the transports to be assured by the British Navy.Aircraft and A.A. equipment to be provided mainly by the British.Land forces and anti-tank equipment to be provided mainly by France.7. Allocation of tasks as between the Franco-British forces and their BalkanAllies must be provided for in a plan of operations which should be completedas soon as possible and at the latest by the 1st of February, 1940, by the French,British and Turkish General Staffs.8. In order that the Allies may be fully prepared within the stipulatedtime limit (see (1) above) the following diplomatic action should be initiatedas soon as possible:  ---(a) Negotiations should be set on foot with the Turks in order to reach agreement;on the principle of Allied intervention and the conditionswhich should govern such intervention;on the material preparations for such intervention, taking into account- VDefensive requirements on the Thrace Front, naval bases, &amp;c.;Communications (improvement of existing facilities andbases, creation of Air bases, &amp;c.);Administrative requirements (camp areas, accumulation of supplies, food, &amp;c.); &apos;. -
Comment 28.Reference is made to the use of Salonica for &quot; subsidiary purposes.&quot; Wewould point out the danger of assuming that we may be able to limit our eventualcommitment once we are in Salonica at all.Comment 29.Clearly, a great many of the proposals which the French put forward in this paper would necessitate intimate Staff Conversations with the Turks. This is contrary to the policy at present approved by the War Cabinet and to the express&quot; wishes of the Turkish Government. The Turks have specifically statedthat they do not want any allied formations to take part in the defence ofThrace. * Their immediate concern is to obtain the necessary equipment to enablethem to defend their Thracian frontier with their own troops. Already our negotiations for the provision of this material are at a deadlock, and it seems doubtful whether we shall be.able to persuade the Turks to withdraw thesuspensive clause, unless we can find some way of meeting their requirements..Even if we persuaded the Turks to agree to Staff Conversations, probably against their will, it would be to our disadvantage to have to reveal the fact that we arenot in a position to afford them the support of Allied troops or aircraft, and asimilar deadlock might well ensue. We recommend, therefore, that carefulconsideration should be given to this question before we initiate Staff Conver-sations. In any event, before such conversations took place, it would be necessaryto obtain Italian concurrence.On the other hand, it should be possible to ask the Turks to develop communi- .cations, ports and aerodromes, as we have recommended (paragraph 25 (iii),Paper No. CCS. (39) 146), without recourse to formal Staff Conversations.[20422] e
8eo- m        (&amp;) Discussions should be entered into with Italy with the object of securingwmmeat        .         - her consent, if possible, or at any rate some clarification of the attitudeshe may adopt if the proposed intervention takes place.....In view of the urgent need for maintaining secrecy as long as possible,diplomatic action in other Balkan States should preferably be postponed until&amp; Inter dfitc.
Comment SO. tThe French proposal that we should undertake a diplomatic approach toItaly raises a question of high policy. Hitherto our policy has been to avoid any action which might prejudice the possibility of Italy becoming a benevolentneutral, or even joining the Allies. It seems possible, however, that Russia&apos;8attack upon Finland may have improved the chances of a successful approach onthe lines proposed by the French.
