(89) 119.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure die secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE EFFECT OF THE DROPPING OF LEAFLETS IN GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for^Foreign Affairs.IN continuation of the memorandum W.P. (39) 82 of the 9th October.I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum summarising further information received as to the effect of the dropping of leaflets in Germany.H.Foreign Office, November 8, 1939.SINCE the last memorandum IP. (39) 82 was prepared for the WarCabinet on the 9th October, additional information has been received which is summarised below.The new information has. as before, been classified, according to source, under three heads: (1) Foreign Governments; (2) Private sources in central countries;and (3) Secret sources.(1) Foreign Governments.(a) Unfavourable.Yugoslavia. - .On the 4th October His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Belgrade were informed bythe Yugoslav Foreign Office that their Consul at dusseldorf, in whom they had great confidence, had reported that tfee contents of the British leaflets had had little or no effect on the local population. He had suggested that it would be advisable to concentrate the leaflet propaganda upon the theme that germany was in for a long war if the Hitler regime were not removed.(2) Private Sources in Nechal Countries.(a) Unfavourable.Holland.On the 7th October a member mf the staff of His Majesty*s Legation atThe Hague reported a conversation with a German business man opposed to the nazis, who maintained that the leaflet raids had been a complete failure, and10684   [20281J
had only cemented German feeling, against the Allies. The leaflets regardingthe fortunes of Nazi leaders had at first been effective, but they had been exploited^so far that the average German had begun to doubt their credibility.On the 19th October the Dutch Secretary of the Amsterdam branch ofthe Netherlands-England Society informed His Majesty&apos;s Legation that a reliableDutch resident of Vienna, who travelled a lot in Germany, had reported thatthe pamphlets made no impression at all, in view of the German victory in poland and the absence of spectacular Allied successes.Switzerland.On the 11th October His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Berne reported the viewsof an important German industrialist from the Bhineland opposed to the nazi regime, obtained through a Swiss banker. According to this informant, theeffect of our leaflets had been the reverse of that intended, and they had createdanti-British rather than anti-Nazi feeling. This particular weapon was notcalculated to impress the German people, who laughed at the idea that Germanstrength could be broken by printed leaflets rather than by armed force. a diplomatic colleague of Sir G. Warner criticised the leaflets on the ground thatthey gave an inadequate return for the risk involved to onr aircraft. Amongthe Swiss, Sir G. Warner reported some divergence of opinion on the value ofthe leaflets.On the 14th October His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Zurich reportedcriticism of the leaflets by a well-informed Swiss, who thought they should concentrate upon exposing the Nazi leaders, and particularly Herr Hitler, ratherthan upon emphasising the hardships which Germany would suffer under theAllied blockade.Denmark.On the 16th October a friendly Danish journalist, who had jnst returned from a ten days&apos; journey from the Danish to the Swiss frontiers of Germanyto ascertain the feeling of the man-in-the-street in Germany, informed HisMajesty&apos;s Legation in Copenhagen that the effect of our leaflets had been slight.Belgium.On the 19th October His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels, in a generalreport on information reaching Belgium about conditions in Germany, statedthat a Dutch tobacco merchant of Antwerp, after a business visit to Hamburg,Aachen. Cologne and Westphalia, had said that nobody in Germany botheredabout the British leaflets at present.On the 9th and 10th October an anti-Nazi German business man from the rhineland, interviewed in Brussels, maintained that the British propaganda leaflets were quite useless and would remain so. The Germans already distrustedtheir own propaganda, and would distrust enemy propaganda even more.(b) Favourable.Denmark.On the 7th October Mr. F. E. Jordan, a former Berlin representative ofthe Federation of British Industries, who had left Berlin on the 1st september and remained in Copenhagen until the 2nd October, criticised the actnaltechnique of the leaflets, but said that according to his information the Germanpolice were very quick to seize upon them, and that the German propagandasen-ices were at great pains to produce as soon as possible indirect replies tothe leaflets in the German press.Holland.On the 11th October the Acting British &quot;Vice-Consul at Leeuwarden reportedinformation from Dusseldorf suggesting that the effect of the leaflet raids was considerable, because people objected to constant air-raid warnings and the consequent interruption of their normal life.
sGeman$.Ob the 19th October Mr. Baylis of the Hamburg Consulate-General, whohad just been released from Germany, said that the leaflets appeared to havehad some effect, mainly because they proved that British aircraft had been ableto fly over Germany.(3) Secret Sources.(a) Unfavourable.According to a report on the 14th October summarising fragmentaryinformation received from all over Germany, the leaflets have not had mucheffect, although it has been greater in the Ruhr than elsewhere. The Gestapoare not. however, leaving anything to chance.On the 25th October a former German diplomat, patriotic but anti-Nazi,-condemned what he called the &quot;childish leaflets.&quot; His relations and friends in Germany had written to him in Switzerland to say how lamentably thispropaganda had failed in its intended effect. The only positive result had been to annoy the anti-Nazis, who resented &quot; enlightenment&quot; from outsiders.German psychology only appreciated force and could only be convinced by military action and not by leaflets.A report from Sir C. Stuart dated the 29th October suggested that inWestphalia the Nazis were attempting to remove apprehension by saying thatour aircraft only dropped leaflets and not bombs.(b) Favourable. *    &apos;Recording to a report of the 6th October, a good German source who hadtravelled recently in different parts of the country said that the leaflets werepretty widely read in spite of the German police measures. They were, however,in his opinion too complicated and had not enough punch.On the 7th October a British source in Copenhagen reported that leafletsdropped in West Germany had been found in Berlin, which proved that theywere circulated. The stringent measures taken bv the German police to preventthe circulation of leaflets was also significant. A German informant in Flensburg(Schleswig) thought the effect was far greater than was believed in Denmark.The leaflets were read and discussed on the quiet and everybody seemed to knowtheir contents.On the 29th October Sir C. Stuart reported that he had heard that the leafletsdropped in the Ruhr were taken into workshops and picked up by children inthe streets.
