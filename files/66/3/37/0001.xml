THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTSECRET i; 0*93 W*l04TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WEEKLY RESUME(No. 12)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR SITUATIONr -        12 noon November 16th to12 noon November 23rd1939Central War Room,November 24, 1939
; i : NAVAL SITUATION.General Notes.THE outstanding event during the week under review has been the intensifiedGerman mining operations in the Thames Estuary and off the Humber, in whichaircraft have played an important part. Enemy mines in these areas haveaccounted for 5 British, 1 French and 5 neutral merchant ships. As a precau-tionary measure Harwich, Humber and the entrances to the Thames were temporarily closed to shipping, the Humber and Thames being reopened on the morning of the 23rd November to a restricted degree. The Germans are apparently using a magnetic mine which raises new and difficult problems ofminesweeping.2. In consequence of this illegal use of mines, following on the numerousinstances of German disregard of the accepted rules of International Law intheir attack on British sea-borne trade, His Majesty&apos;s Government has decidedto institute control over German exports as a reprisal.3. At the commencement of the week the necessary redistribution of british naval forces in Foreign Waters took place consequent on the appearance of theGerman raider in the Indian Ocean, which was referred to in last week&apos;s Resume.Home Watan. &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;*&quot;*&quot;4. In the early part of the week the Home Fleet was engaged in coveringand escorting the homeward bound Norwegian convoy. Since then light forces have been continuously at sea, in an endeavour to intercept the Bremen, whichwas reported to have left Murmansk.5. During the week the Northern Patrol has been maintained between the orkneys and Greenland by an average strength of five cruisers and five armed merchant cruisers. Six German merchant ships have been intercepted in this area, of which three scuttled themselves to avoid-capture. - -.-   ,-.- -   ..6. Minelaying by enemy aircraft, using parachutes, was carried out&quot; bymoonlight on the nights of the 20th, 21st and 22nd November on the East Coast.A number of minor unsuccessful attacks by aircraft on naval vessels in theNorth Sea have taken place. Details of these incidents are given in the AirSection of this Resume.      . V.7. H.M. Submarine Thetis has been safely berthed in Cammell Laii&apos;d&apos;s atBirkenhead. where she will be reconditioned for service in the Fleet.8. At the time of going to press an extensive redisposition of forces in home Waters was in progress, in conjunction wjth air searches, as a result of thesighting of the German pocket battleship Deutschland by H.M.S. Rawalpindi(armed merchant cruiser), between Iceland and The Faroes on the evening ofthe 23rd November. Rawalpindi reported she was being chased by Deutschland.Later reports indicate that Rawalpindi was sunk, and H.M.S. Chitral (armed merchant Cruiser) has picked up 10 survivors.9. In the Thames area H.M.S. Mastiff (minesweeper) was sunk by a mineon the 20th November. Five of the crew are missing, presumed killed, i died ofwounds, and 9 others are wounded.10. H.M.S. Belfast (10,000-ton 6-inch-gun cruiser) was damaged by a mineon the morning of the 21st November in the Firth of Forth and was subsequentlytowed to and docked in Rosyth. Damage is said to be extensive. Three ratingswre seriously wounded and seventeen slightly wounded.11. H.M.S. Adventure (minelaying cruiser) reported mined in last week&apos;resume&apos; was docked on arrival at Sheerness.  She requires an extensive refit.12. H.M.S. Gipsy (destroyer) was mined at the entrance of HarwichHarbour on the night of the 21st November. She was proceeding to sea outsidethe normal channel as aircraft had been observed to lay mines in the Fairway.She is now beached with her back broken.. One officer was seriously wounded and2 slightly wounded; 29 ratings are missing, presumed killed, 1 rating was badlywounded and 10 slightly wounded. &apos;
13. On the 22nd November M/S trawler H.M.S. A ragonite, while returning from patrol to Dover, was mined in the Downs and. subsequently sank. Fourratings were slightly wounded. /14. H.M.S. Inglefield (destroyer leader) was apparently twice missed bytorpedo on the 22nd*November off the Abekdeenshire Coast. In each instancean explosion took place close astern.15. Between 2-30 p.m. on the 20th November and 9-20 a.m. on the2tst November a number of fishing trawlers were attacked by gunfire, from aTJ-Boat and sunk. Full particulars are not yet known, but it is feared that sixor seven have been lost, including Thomas Hawkins, Seasweeper and Del-phine.Foreign Waters.16. From the interrogation of survivors of the S.S. Africa Shell (reportedsunk in last week&apos;s Resume) it is probable that the German raider off the east coast of Africa is the pocket battleship Admiral Scheer. There are no furtherconfirmed reports of ships sunk by this raider, but one merchantman must beadded to the four previously reported as overdue. Directional wireless reports on the 17th November save the position of the raider 500 miles East by Southof Durban. Powerful hunting groups are being maintained in the North andSouth Atlantic and Indian Ocean to cover focal areas of our trade.17. The German merchant ship Adolph Woermann (8,577 tons) which was reported to have left Lobito. West Africa, in company with the Windhuk, aprobable armed raider, scuttled herself to avoid capture by H.M.S. Neptune,which picked up one hundred and sixty-two passengers and crew. The GermanS.S. Trifels (6,200 tons) has been captured by a French Armed Merchant Cruiser400 miles west of the Azores.18. The 1st Motor Torpedo Boat Flotilla consisting of 12 boats is era route for England from the Mediterranean. One of them, M.T.B. No. 6 sank without loss of life in a storm off Sardinia while on passage from Malta to Marseilles.M.T.B.&apos;s No. 1 and 19 proceeded into the Gulf of Asinarch for shelter, while theremainder have arrived at Aiaccio.19. It has now finally been decided to withdraw all gunboats from the partof the Yangtze controlled by the Japanese.Anti-Submarine Operations.20. During the week under review 8 attacks have been carried out by destroyers and patrol vessels, 4 by anti-submarine trawlers and 2 by aircraft. no definite success has been claimed.&quot; but an attack by H.M.S. Echo on a U-boat whichhad been shelling a merchantman, and had subsequently sunk another by torpedo250 miles W. of Usbant, is considered to have been successful and the U-boatprobably sunk.21. It is estimated that 2 U-boats are operating in the Western Approaches,one on the East Coast, and in addition there are reports of JT-boats in the Clyde,Liverpool Bay, Bristol Channel and English Channel.22. Deep British minefields have been laid in the Thames Estuary and inthe mouth of the Clyde, and two further lines in the Dover Barrage have beencompleted.23.   The estimated casualties to U-boats up to the 20th November were Known sunk       ...      ... ......... 7Probably sunk     ....     .^              ...... 14Probably seriously damaged ...      ...... 5Probably slightlv damaged ...      ...... 0Not yet classified......&quot; ...      ...      ... 3There are now 112 auxiliary anti-submarine trawlers in commission, anincrease of 13 since the beginning of the week under review. A large number ofthese trawlers are now patrolling off the East Coast, in the Irish Sea and theEnglish Channel.[20371] b 2
Distribution of Gorman Main Fleet.24. The following units of the German Fleet were located by air recon-naissance on the 17th November: Schillig Roads      ...     ...     ...     1 Battle Cruiser.3 Destroyers.Off Wilhelmshaven ...   .......      1 Battle Cruiser.* Inside Wilhelmshaven     ......      1 Cruiser &quot; Ko n &quot; Class.6 Destroyers.1 Torpedo Boat.1 Battleship.No important movements were reported thereafter except that eleven Germandestroyers were reported 200 miles north of Amsterdam at 2 p.m. on the22nd November.German Attack on Sea-Borne Trade.Submarine A Hack.25. In addition to the trawlers sunk by shell fire off the North-West coast ofIreland which have already been mentioned, four British ships (not in convoy)and one French ship (in French convoy) have been sunk by torpedo during theperiod under review. AH except one of these were sunk in the western approaches.The details of these ships are as follows: S.S. Arlington Court (4,915 tons) with a cargo of maize, originally inoonvoy, Sierra Leone to Hull, was torpedoed and sunk on the 16th November inthe Western Approaches. Twenty-five survivors were landed by the DutchM/V Algeniv and seven by the Norwegian Spinongar. One killed and fivemissing.Trawler Wigmore (345 tons) was destroyed by an explosion, presumed to bea torpedo, 20 miles North of Kinnatrd Head (E. of Moray Firth) on the18th November. The crew of sixteen were all killed.S.S. Pensilva (4,258 tons), with a cargo of maize, was first shelled by aU-boat and then sunk by torpedo on the 19th November in the western approaches. She was unarmed and not in convoy. All the crew were rescued bythe destroyer Echo, who subsequently attacked the U-boat with probable success. -S.S. Darino (1,351 tons), with a cargo of wine and general cargo, was suiilc&apos;by torpedo on the 19th November in the Western Approaches.  She was unarmedand not in convoy. Eleven of the crew were picked up by the U-boat, who latertransferred them to the Italian S.S. Caterina Gerolimich.On the 22nd November a French ship (name unknown at present) was sunk bytorpedo in the Western Approaches. She was in a French convoy. Details of casulties not available.Mining.26. Four British, two French and eight neutral ships have been sunk bymines. Eight of these ships were mined in the approaches to the Thames and.except for S.S. Lowland, the positions are shown on the attached chart. Thedetails of these ships are as follows: S.S. Blackhill (2.492 tons), with a cargo of iron-ore. Two men and pilotreported drowned, Captain wounded. Twenty-two survivors landed byH.M.S. Gipsy.S.S. Torchbearer (1,267 tons), with a cargo of coal for London. Fourjofcrew missing. Thirteen rescued by H.M.S. Greyhound, four of whom were seriously wounded.S.S. Geraldus (2,495 tons), with a cargo of coal bound Tyne to Bruges., H-M.S. Witern picked up all the crew.
S.S. Lowland (974 tons), collier, was sank at 6 p.m. on the 22nd Novemberwest of the Sunk Light Vessel. The master was killed and eleven of the creware missing.  Two. survivors landed by a trawler. &quot; &apos;.French S.S. Rhuys (2,921 tons) was sunk 3 miles south of the HumberLightship on the 19th November. Fourteen survivors were landed atGrimsby.French trawler Sainte Marthe (250 tons) was sunk off Boulogne on the21st-22nd November.  There was one survivor.Yugoslav S.S. Carica MiUca (6,370 tons) bound from Ttne toDubrovnick.   The crew of twenty-six were saved.Dutch S.S. Simon Bolivar (8,309 tons) struck two mines at 10-minuteintervals. Eight killed, including Master. Seventy-six missing. Eighty-four in hospital.Italian S.S. Grazia (5,857 tons) from Tyne to Italy. Five killed.Twenty-six survivors rescued by H.M.S. Griffin and Gipsy.Lithuanian S.S. Kaunas (1,521 tons) sunk near Rotterdam on the19th November.  The crew were saved.Japanese Terukuni Mara (11,930 tons), general cargo, bound Yokohamato London. One hundred and seventy-eight Japanese and twenty-sixpassengers saved, three being slightly wounded.Italian S.S. Fianona (6,660 tons). All the crew are safe. The fate ofthis ship is uncertain.Swedish S.S. B. O. Borjessen (1,586 tons), in ballast for Tyne and sweden, was mined and sunk A\ miles off the mouth of the Humber on the19th November. Six missing. Thirteen saved, eight of whom were wounded.Greek S.S. Elena (4,500 tons) was sunk near Portland Bill on the22nd November, it is believed by a mine. The crew of twenty-four were landed at Weymouth without serious casualties.British S.S. J. J. Maguire (10,000 tons), tanker, outward bound in convoy,struck a mine, but managed to reach Harwich. She will be docked atTilbury.27. Coastguards reported an unusually heavy explosion near Lowestoft onthe morning of the 17th, and another in the evening. Two heavy explosions were reported in the Bristol Channel, south-east of Swansea, on the 21st. these reports may indicate that enemy mines are prematurely exploding. In the humber area nine moored mines were swept up South of the Humber Light Vesselon the 20th November. A mine dropped from aircraft has been recovered fromthe sea off Shoeburyness and is being closely examined.Surface Raiders.28. An unconfirmed press report states that S.S. Clan Ogilvy (5,802 tons),bound from Lorenco Marques in E. Africa to Madagascar, has been sunk off theMozambique coast, presumably by the A admiral Scheer.29.

&quot;protection of Sea-Borae Trade.     -Convoys. - &apos;/, &apos; &apos; V      &apos;30. Eleven convoys, comprising 232 ships, have sailed from or arrived at ports of the United Kingdom during the period under review. This is lessthan last week due to the fact that two convoys have been held up in theDowns and off Harwich to enable the Thames approaches to be cleared of mines.No British ship has been attacked by U-boat in convoy, but a French ship in convoy was sunk in the Bay of Biscay on the 22nd instant. The homeward convoy from Norway, consisting of eleven ships loaded with iron ore, timber, wood pulpand pit props, arrived safely on the 18th instant31. The average number of convoys at sea was 18. The escort forcesemployed daily amounted to one battleship, one cruiser, four armed merchant cruisers, five escort vessels and twelve destroyers, besides three French scoutsescorting between Gibraltar and the Western Approaches. The French are running slow convoys, speed 8 to 12 knots, from Casablanca to Bordeaux,St. Lazaire and Brest every 8 to 10 days.Economic Warfare.British Contraband Control.32. Ninety-one neutral ships of 405,402 tons and 3 British ships of10,986 tons were in British Contraband Control Ports on the 22nd November;31 of these ships have been in over a week and only 9 over a fortnight. Norwayheads the list of ships detained. During the week ending the 18th November,205 ships were dealt with by the Contraband Control, 74 of these being final decisions in cases shown in previous returns. In this period 47 ships were detained,148 released and a part or the whole of 38 cargoes seized.33. At the present time there are now nearly 160 ships in the Downs owingto through traffic having been stopped whilst the channels are thoroughly swept,which is causing considerable congestion. A Contraband Control Base is nowbeing formed at Falmouth.34. Of the 14,000 tons of cargoes or parts of cargoes seized in Prize thisweek. 1,150 tons of ores and metals, 3,100 tons of petroleum products, 1,550 tonsof oil seeds, 1,850 tons of food-stuffs and 2,900 tons of cotton are the mostimportant items. Since the 7th October 55 ships, of an average capacity of ,000 tons, have cleared with iron-ore from Narvik. Of these, 20 were British,6 German and 29 Neutral.35. The United States State Department have made it clear that theyvery much dislike the idea of American ships being taken into Kirkwall forcontraband control purposes now that Kirkwall is in the area designated by president Roosevelt as prohibited under the Neutrality Act.German Contraband Control.36. The Germans are reported to be enforcing their contraband control inthe Baltic and its near approaches with, the assistance of aircraft and armed trawlers. The German Official News Agency announces that during september and October 127 neutral ships carrying 245,455 tons of merchandise were broughtinto German Control Stations and explains that in some cases the cargoes werenot confiscated.MILITARY OPERATIONS.Western Front.Operations.37. Apart from patrolling by the Germans on the Rbtne-Moselle portionof the front, there is little to record. The River Lauter is in full flood, andthe high level of the Rhine has forced the enemy to evacuate some of his fortifications-tions on that front. Otherwise he has spent the week improving his defences nearTorbach in the south, in the Rhine-Moselle sector, and on the extension of the siegfried Line to the north.
tEnemy movements. &quot; &apos; -      %      .38. Few reportsof enemy troop movement have been received The mostimportant is the arrival of a motorised division in the Aachen area on the1/th November. More recent reports, however, indicate that troops on the dutch frontier between Sittard and Roermond have been moved about ten miles east-wards, which may mean a redistribution of German forces opposite this frontierSoviet Russia.39. No events of military importance have occurred during the week, andthere does not appear to be any abnormal activity on the Finnish and Roumanianfrontiers. Further reports that the Red Army is constructing fortifications along the new frontier in Poland have been received.Poland.40. From recent reports it would seem that any former inhabitants of Polandwho can choose their place of residence within the old boundaries are faced with achoiceof misfortunes. The Russians, professingto bring freedom to the Ukrainiansand White Russians, have killed or deported the landowners, professional men andpolitical leaders,removed most of thefood supplies and commandeered all &quot;spare&quot;clothing not actually in wear. Boots can still be bought for  8 a pair. By wayof conciliation, the land has been divided to give each peasant about 2 hectares:collective farms have not yet been formed; churches are still open; self-government is pretended and the Poles that are left are treated withouthostility. German policy, on the contrary, is founded on hostility. Many Poleshave been shot and whole families exterminated. All Poles and Jews are beingdriven from the Corridor and the Silesian districts, and all, except peasants,from the Lodz area and south of it. Large estates are being divided to providefarms for repatriated Germans. The homeless are left to settle in the devastatedarea east of Lodz, and Jews, including many from the Reich, are to be herded&apos;into a small area about Lublin which is unlikely to be able to support them.As in Russian Poland, food queues are general. Whereas the Russian attemptto prevent emigration to Roumania has not been very successful, the germans have organised a special corps of Ukrainian emigrants, the Sitchovitsi, to preventthe escape of the miserable Poles over the Slovakian border. It is not beyond thebounds of possibility that these Ukrainian malcontents may later be used forsubversive activities in Russian Ukraine. In both parts of Poland guerrillabands, organised by ex-Polish officers, are active in the forest districts, and considerable secret stores of arms are available to sustain their efforts.Finnish Defences.41. The Finnish defences are mainly concentrated in the KarelianIsthmus, but extend slightly to the north of Lake Ladoga. Bevond this there isno continuous line. Troops are posted at intervals along the whole length of theeastern frontier to the Arctic Circle. Wherever such troops are to be found somedefences exist, usuallv in the form of felled trees with a little barbed wire and simple trenches The Isthmus Line, which lies about twenty-five miles north of thefrontier, was first traced in 1919-20 and fortified with blockhouses and pillboxes,but nothing larger. Its development in depth was only undertaken in the spring of 1939. It contains no heavily fortified defensive works and relies mainly on anti-tank obstacles in the intervals between the many lakes. The lakes themselvesform a strong natural defence, though for some time after the New Year they,are frozen hard and can be crossed bv the heaviest traffic. They afford the bestdefence in the early winter and again in the spring when they have sufficientice to prevent the use of boats, but insufficient to bear troops and transport.
There are no important defences forward of the Isthmus, although acertain amount of work has been done nearer the frontier, more especially by voluntary labour during the summer of 1939; this consists of tank-pits,chevaux-de-frise and ordinary trenches without any reinforcement. Should theFinnish Government agree to the cession of this frontier district to Russia, there might be considerable anger among the troops and the population at the doubleindignity of being asked to give up soil to the historic enemy and hand overfront-line defences which, though unimportant in themselves, had been constructed with enthusiasm by all classes.Italy and Italian Possessions.42. Further indications confirm the impression that special attention isbeing paid to the completion of army organisation and the improvement oftraining. Reports of partial demobilisation continue to be vague and conflicting.Overseas garrisons are little short of war strength, but the situation in Italy is obscure. Leave was granted to reservists from about mid-September for essential agricultural work, but there is no information to show if those reservistshave returned to the colours. Men required by industrial concerns are apparentlyreleased from service on the request of their employers. Although manyindividuals appear to have been granted indefinite leave, there is as yet noreliable evidence of the release of any complete class of reservists. It seems likely, therefore, that the degree of demobilisation is being intentionally obscuredin order to effect economy by discharging soldiers without the concomitant riskof appearing unprepared. Contrary to previous reports, it seems that about two-thirds of the colonists that arrived in Libya were landed at Tripoli, and only about one-third in Cirenaica. The military situation in other Italianoverseas possessions remains generally unaltered.The Balkans and Turkey.43. Demobilisation from 180,000 effectives to about 90,000 has been pratically completed in Greece. It seems possible, although not yet certain,that Bulgaria may also reduce the strength of her army to about half its present strength of 200,000. In Turkey and Roumania, however, there are,no signs ofdemobilisation.Far East.Military Operations.44. The Japanese have made two main landings on the coast of westernKwangtung, one near Pakhoi and the other 50 miles further west in theLukgmun area. The latter is, apparently, the principal operation. FromLrxGMUN Japanese forces have advanced inland, obviously directed on Nanning,80 miles to the north. The capture of Nanning would cut road communications with Indo-China, where large quantities of war material have been accumulatedat Haiphong for transport into China. On the 22nd November the Japanese were reported to have reached the border of Kwangsi, where the Chinese claim to havehalted the Japanese advance.Situation at Tientsin.45. Discrimination against British nationals at the barriers to the concession, and against British interests generally, continues. River navigationis subjected to crippling restrictions. Modification of restrictions in one directionis quickly neutralised by new restrictions in another. The local Japanesemilitary commanders have indicated openly that they regard their, hold ouTientsin as a useful means of forcing a solution of the Tientsin problem in a manner satisfactory to themselves, and aver that restrictions will not be relaxeduntil they have achieved their purpose. ;
-     t   fRusso-Japanese relations. 1    -* - .   -46. An increasing number of rumours are prevalent regarding attempts toimprove Russo-Japanese relations. These attempts are mostly attributed to theJapanese, with German support. Some of the Japanese extremist militaryleaders would probably favour a form of accommodation with Soviet Russia, onthe German model, in order to allow Japan to concentrate more fully on a solutionof the China affair. It is conceivable that these rumours have been strengthened by the agreement reached, during the past week, between japan and Soviet Russia on the composition and work of a mixed commissionto demarcate the frontier between Outer Mongolia and Manchuria in thearea which was the scene of recent fighting between Soviet and japanese forces. An uncertain factor in Russo-Japanese relations is Russian assistanceto China. By promising to cut off supplies of instructors and war material forthe Chinese armies, Russia has a persuasive argument for use with the Japanese.As a threat, the same factor can be used to bring pressure to bear on chiang kai-shek -shek to concede Soviet demands. Russia is already trying, in this way, toobtain more executive power for the Chinese Communist and ex-Red Armyleaders.AIR SITUATION. ;German Air Force.Operations over the North Sea.47. Enemy coastal aircraft have shown considerable activity over the North .Sea, and seaplanes have dropped mines in shallow waters. On the night ofthe 20th November eleven raids of varying size were plotted between 6-20 p.m.and 7-25 p.m. from Felixstowe down the coast to Mahgate, and on the eveningsof the 21st and 22nd further raids were reported off the Humbeb, andThames Estuary. Fighters, sent up to investigate failed to make contact.On the night of the 21st November an enemy seaplane was seen to landon the water off the Humber, and appeared to be laying mines; reports ofapparent mine-laying from the air were also received from Dover, Harwich andGhimsby (where two parachutes were seen to be dropped). An enemy seaplanewas picked up by searchlights and shot down by anti-aircraft guns from the isle of Grain in the Thames Estuary about 10 p.m. on the 22nd November.48. Enemy reconnaissance aircraft have also appeared over the Shetlands,Scapa Flow and Cromarty Firth. On the 22nd November six enemy aircraftapproached the Seaplane Depot ship Manela, lying in a Shetland anchorage,but they turned away on being engaged by the anti-aircraft guns ofH.M.S. Coventry. Later Leewick Harbour (Shetlands) was attacked by four enemy aircraft with incendiary bombs. A seaplane lying in the harbour was destroyed, but there were no casualties. One bomb was dropped near H.M.S.Boadicea on the 20th November about 60 miles east of Chomer. There was also an attack on H.M.S. Jaguar.Mines Dropped by Seaplanes.49. We have secured a specimen of the mines dropped by German seaplaneswhich proves to be about 5 feet 6 inches long and fifteen inches in diameter.It is fitted with a parachute to reduce the speed at which it hits the water and,presumably, to ensure that it lands in an upright position. The size and weightof the mine should enable it to be carried on the German long-range bomberwithout undue modification of the bomb-carrying gear. So far, however, theenemy appear only to have dropped mines from the seaplanes of their coastal units.It is not known what is the maximum height at which they can be effectivelyreleased.[20371]
Operations on the Western Front.50. The German Air Force hare been very active, particularly in recon-noitring the French coast between Donetsk and Boulogne. It would appearthat they have directed special attention to the railway system and aerodromesbehind this line of coast. The enemy have also reconnoitred widely over theinterior of France, dropping leaflets in the south-east, south, centre, and extremesouth-west. \In the course of their nights the German Air Force have continued to violateBelgian neutrality, and on a number of occasions Swiss neutrality also.German Bomber Force Activity.51. Apart from normal training, there has been little known activity ofthe German Air Force bombers during the past week.Expansion of German Aircraft Industry.52. Further evidence of the intended expansion of the German aircraft industry is shown by advertisements which have appeared in German newspapersthis month. A close watch is being kept on these developments, which appear toindicate that new factories are being built and other factories enlarged.French Air Force.Operations on the Western Front.53. A number of valuable long and short reconnaissance flights have beencarried out, but these have generally failed to disclose any exceptional activitybehind the German lines. The French in these flights have dropped a number of propaganda pamphlets. Fighter sorties have been numerous and, although onmost days no enemy aircraft were actually engaged, on the 21st November threewere shot down a long reconnaissance aircraft and two fighters and on the22nd five German aircraft were destroyed (one by AA. fire) and a sixth landed in France.   .Royal Air Force Operations.Western Front. ^54. On the 16th November two Blenheims were despatched on a photo-graphic reconnaissance of the Siegfried Line near Emmerich. One of these aircraft was forced down near Ghent due to freezing of the controls, the othercompleted its task and landed in England with reports of heavy traffic on the rhine, but no unusual road or rail movements. On the 20th November twoWhitley aircraft from Dishforth carried out a night reconnaissance overHamburg and Bremen, and dropped leaflets in that area.On the 21st two Whitley aircraft took off from France to drop leaflets overthe Dusseldorf, Stuttgart and Frankfurt areas. No casualties occurred in either of these flights.55. Eighty-nine fighter patrols, involving two hundred and eleven aircraft were sent up during the week, but only on two occasions was contact made withthe enemy. One of the engagements was indecisive, but in the other, one enemy aircraft was shot down.Bomber Operations over the North Sea.56. On the morning of the 17th November four Blenheim aircraft of No. 2Group carried out a reconnaissance of the naval bases at Heligoland andWilhelmshaven. Good photographs were obtained. No vessels of importancewere shown to be at Heligoland, but a number of important units were observedat Wilhelmshaven and in the Schillig Roads (see paragraph 24 above).
