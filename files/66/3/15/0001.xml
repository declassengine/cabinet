Bay Reconnaissances.        Six Blenheim aircraftleft on the 30th October to reconnoitre aerodromes andestuaries in north-west Germany with the object of testingthe accuracy of reports of concentrations of german aircraft and of transport vessels;   the aircraft, whichflew separately, were each allotted specific reconnaissanceareas.    Conditions of low cloud and poor visibility were encountered, and there was opposition both by enemy aircraft and by anti-aircraft gun-fire, but excellent results were nevertheless obtained, including photographs taken from low heights;   one of the pilots flew at 200feet above the docks at Wilhelmshaven.
