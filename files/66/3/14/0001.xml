NAVAL SITUATION.German Attack on Sea-borne Trade.DURING the week under review three British cargo vessels and two trawlersof a total tonnage of 18,774 tons have been lost by enemy submarine action. OneFrench ship was also sunk by submarine.   Details are as follows: S.S. Bronte (5,317 tons). .........Torpedoed at midnight 27th-28th October in the Western Approaches,when outward bound in a convoy escorted by 2 destroyers. She -remainedafloat and was towed towards Swansea until the 30th when owing to a galeshe broke adrift and was sunk. All the crew were saved by the destroyerWalpole. -&quot;S.S. Malabar (7,978 tons).Torpedoed in the early morning of the 29th October in the western approaches, when homeward bound in a convoy escorted by 2 destroyers.This ship carried the Commodore of the convoy and, except for 1 engineerand-4 stokers killed by the explosion, the whole crew were saved by the destroyer Grafton when she sank the following afternoon. Her cargoconsisted of 5,200 tons of food-stuffs and 1,000 tone of tobacco.S.S. Caimmona (4,666 tons).Torpedoed on the night of the 30th October off Eattray Head while on passage to the Tyne with general cargo, 41 of her crew of 44 were saved.Trawlers St. Nid-an (565 tons), Lynx II (250 tons).Sunk north of Cape Wrath on the morning of the 28th October, the crews being rescued by trawler Lady Hogarth.French S.S. Badoule (5,874 tons).Sunk on the 31st October north of Cape Finjsterre. , She was in a french convoy. :.......There have been no British or French ships lo3t by mine or air attack thisweek On the 31st October the northbound East Coast Convoy was attacked byone enemy aircraft which dropped two bombs without damage to ships orcasualties to personnel. - .....-2. No neutral ships have been sunk by submarine or air attack, but twohave been lost by mine in the North Sea, viz.: Norwegian S.S. Varangmalm (3,618 tons).Crew of 30 saved.  Cargo iron ore.Finnish S.S. June (1,241 tons).26 saved, 5 missing.  In ballast.The City of Flint is reported to have left Tromso on the 30th Octoberescorted by a Norwegian destroyer, and by noon the 2nd November she had notbeen sighted by our forces patrolling the Norwegian coast.3. There has been no report of enemy surface raider activities this week,bat three British ships which left South African ports at the end of Septemberare overdue at Freetown. It is, however, too soon yet to presume they have been lost, as they may have proceeded direct to the United Kingdom.4. The total losses of merchant shipping from enemy action up to the endof October were: No. of :Ships.        Tonnage.British......      .,.   ......   56 238,798Allied     ...............       6 42,059Neutral   ...............     29 71,70791352,564
The average daily rate of sinking from all causes up to the 28th Octoberiras ships 1-5 and tonnage 5,900. Comparative figures for the peak period in1917 are^-ships 5-7 and tonnage 18,100. *5. It is reported that thirty-eight neutral ships have been stopped by theGermans and sent in to German ports for examination in the month of October of these, the majority are either Finnish or Swedish ships.A^tj-Snbrnapine Operations. .6. There have been fourteen attacks, nine by ships and five by aircraft, on enemy submarines this week. In no instance has success been definitely proved,bat there is reason to hope that damage may have been inflicted on two occasions.Of these the most promising is an attack carried out at midnight, 30th-31st Octo-iet, by HJI.S. Somali on a submarine off Kiknaird Head, which appeared to have been lying in -wait for a special Norwegian Convoy. After being located ahead of the Convoy, the submarine seems to have dived under it. She was located againas she came clear astern, and a great many attacks were delivered in the ensuinghunt, which was continued for more than 24 hours. The other attack, which mayhave produced damage, was carried out by His Majesty&apos;s Sb.ipg.-fr/nwwa andZulu- off St. Abbs Head, in the evening of the 28th October. fitt*Mij7. Of the remaining attacks, one was carried out by H.M.S. Whirlwind onihe submarine which had first torpedoed S.S. Bronte on the 27th October. Therewas, however, no apparent result. The Polish destroyer Blyskawica attacked aperiscope off the Mull of Galloway on the 28th October, with no apparentsuccess. In addition to the attacks there have been eight hunts for submarineswhich had been reported, but no attacks resulted. ...8. The identity of the submarine reported in Weekly Resume No. 8 as beingashore on the Goodwins on the 25th October is in doubt. It has not yet beenpossible to enter this submarine, which is now sinking into the sand. On the morning of the 26th October H.M.S. Beagle picked up four bodies North-West of cape Grisnez wearing life-saving apparatus labelled U. 14. Medical opinion was that the bodies had only been dead for a matter of hours. The body of anofficer, believed to be the Captain of U. 14, was picked up by French authoritiesoa the 27th October to the West of Cape Grisnez, and medical opinion is thatthis body and that of another officer were only recently dead.On the 29th October French authorities picked up near Calais the body ofXapt-leutnant Von der Ropp wearing escape apparatus marked D. 12. Medicalopinion was of the opinion that the body had been in the water about three weeks.There is no record of attack to conform with this information, and it is thoughtpossible, therefore, that the Dover barrage may have accounted for othersubmarines than those known to have been sunk.9. The estimated positions of U-boats on the 2nd November were: 1 off Norwegian Coast.1 off East Coast of Scotland.1 West of Hebrides (Homeward bound).1 West of Iceland (Outward bound).3 in Western Approaches.1 West of Gibraltar.10. Seventeen convoys, comprising a total of 339 ships, have sailed from orarrived at ports of the United Kingdom during the week under review. Twoslips (S.S. Bronte and Malabar) were lost in convoy.It is perhaps of interest to note that there is at present on passage one convoyoi 53 ships, including 20 tankers.Ccasoya.[20250]b 2

The total number of vessels convoyed up to the 31st October was: British.........2,164 Ships lost in ConvoyAllied.........     120 6Neutral.........      17 Percentage loss- 0-3 per cent.2^01Home Waters GenaysL12. The arrival of several more armed merchant cruisers has enabled thenorthern patrol to be further strengthened. The Home Fleet has been almostcontinuously at sea covering the operations of this force, the passage of the narvik convoy and the operations for intercepting the S.S. City of FUnt. the lack of an adequately defended operational base for the Home Fleet is proving aserious handicap. The light forces based on the East coast have been considerably increased.Mining. *13. A further extension to the British minefield off Flam borough Headhas been made.The work of clearing the German minefield off the Humber entrance hasbeen interfered with by bad weather, and is being continued. Two neutral ships were lost in this area during the week.The bad weather has also been responsible for several mines being washedashore on the East Coast. One exploded against the sea wall at Bridlengton and caused damage to windows and doors of nine or ten houses in the vicinity, andthere was a similar incident at Flam borough Head.Naval Casualties.14.  The total naval casualties by -enemy action to the end of October are: Killed. Wounded..Officers        ...     ...     .........        74 8Eatings.......     ...     ......     1,379         48Maltese ratings      ......      ...... 181,471 36German Merchant Shipping.15. The S.S. Emmy Frederick (4,327 tons), which left Tampico on the20th October with large quantities of provisions, was intercepted by H^LS.Caradoc on the 26th October and scuttled herself to avoid capture. Her crew were taken to Bermuda in the cruiser. Since the outbreak of-war nine Germanmerchantmen have been captured, totalling 51,837 tons; and 7 ships, totalling33,959 ton6, have sunk themselves to avoid capture.16. In the past week there has been some activity amongst the german ships that took refuge in neutral ports at the outbreak of hostilities. Fourhave sailed from various ports, and one is known to have arrived in norwegian waters. The crack liner Scharnhorst at Kobe has stocked up with provisions,including 45 tons of beer.Economic Warfare.17. 181 ships have been adjudged by the Courts during the past week,and the whole or part of 51 cargoes were seized in prize. Some idea of the extensive work of the contraband control ports is given by the following figuresfor the 30th October. At Kikkwall, Bamsgate and Weymouth on this daythere were 92 neutral ships of an aggregate tonnage of 387,281 gross tons, this number includes 25 Duteh, 19 Norwegian and 12 Greek ships.
18. Since the beginning of the war 401,078* tons of cargo destined for germany have been seized at sea.included in this figure are  TonsMineral ore and metals ...Fuel and lubricating oil ...Wheat and other food-stuffs     ...Oil seedsHubber170,00087,00029,00029,000S.C0OMILITARY SITUATION.&apos;vWestern Front &quot;Operations.19. The weather has been bad throughout the week and there has been littleoperational activity. The Germans have carried out normal patrolling on theMoselle-Rhine sector of the front, with occasional, local attacks supported byartillery fire. The floods on the Rhine front reached their peak point on the27th October, since when they have been gradually subsiding. On the 28thOctober the water had gone down sufficiently to enable the enemy to reoccupysome of the defensive works which he had been forced to evacuate several daysearlier. The general impression of the past week is that the Germans have not made any serious attempts to establish contact, but have concentrated on the consolidation of their positions along the frontier.Troop Movement.20. Unfavourable weather conditions have made strategic air reconnaissance of German roads and railways difficult, and no reliable information of movementshas been obtained. There are, however, indications that some movement offormations from Central to Western Germany has taken place, and unconfirmedreports have been received of the presence of armoured units opposite the dutch frontier. One point of interest is the number of reports of concentrations in north-West Germany and on the coast between the Rivers Weseh and Emsof parachute troops and material for landing operations. These reports haverevived the rumours of raids being intended in the near future against GreatBritain, either by air or sea, of an attack against Holland, or simultaneous raids against Great Britain and Holland. If this is the intention, the Germans have very obligingly disclosed their plans.Communications.21. Some bridging activity has been reported opposite the southern portionof the Dutch frontier. A pontoon bridge has been built across the Tiver Rhineat Emmerich.On the 26th October considerable alarm was caused in neutral countries bythe interruption by the Germans of all telephonic communication between germany on the one hand and Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Belgium and Switzer-land on the other. These communications were re-established later in the day,but on a considerably reduced scale. The interruption is thought to have been due to the German intention of tightening up censorship.Distribution of German forces.22. The total number of enemy divisions is believed to be a hundred and thirty-two. Of these, seventy-seven are known to be in Western Germany, andelements of a further sixteen divisions have been identified in the same areas.Changes in the German High Command.23. Reports continue to be received of the replacement of General vanBrauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, by General von Reichenan. Itis impossible to get confirmation of the change, but, whether he has become Com-mander-in-Chief or not, General von Reichenau is likely to ^)lay an important part in the war. He is fifty-four years of age and was commissioned in 1903 in[20250] \ b3
a Guard Artillery Regiment In 1938 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief,4th (Mechanized) Army Group. General von Beichenan is a voang, energeticand ambitious, political soldier and a strong supporter of the Nazi Party.British Expeditionary Force.24. No change has taken place on the British front during the week. Theconstruction of field fortifications has continued, and the defence system is steadilybecoming more extensive.Gibraltar25. One battalion from Gibraltar is being sent to France. This will reducethe number of the battalions in the garrison from three to the normal two. Thethird battalion was only sent out in the spring, when the attitude of Italy and spain was threatening.Sosiet Russia. vStrain of Mobilisation.26. It is becoming increasingly evident that the Soviet Union is sufferingfrom the strain of partial mobilisation. Train services throughout the country were seriously disorganised, and as late as the 19th October normal services hadnot been resumed. Mobilisation was carried out at very short notice. Peasantsand even factory workers were taken straight from their work and despatched by rail to their units. There has evidently been great difficulty in equipping reserve divisions, while the supplies of clothing for regular divisions proved unsatis-factory. It is universally believed that the Soviet Union is having trouble in maintaining her armies in Poland.Food supplies in Moscow have been fairly well maintained, though probablyat the expense of drawing on reserve stocks; the very ample supplies of meatavailable suggest, moreover, that abnormal slaughtering is taking place owing to lack of adequate fodder for the winter. The food situation in Leningrad hasbeen less satisfactory.The weight of evidence tends, therefore, to confirm previous estimates thatBussia could not at present fight a serious offensive war.Relations with Baltic States.27. During the week Soviet moves to consolidate the position on the BalticCoast have made some progress, though the Finnish question is still unsettled.It is believed that the principal obstacles to an agreement are the demands forthe lease of naval bases and a mutual assistance pact. The Soviet demands hadbeen kept a close secret by the Finns, who hoped thereby to avoid involving Sovietprestige; their publication by M. Molotov came as an unwelcome surprise.The Soviet-Lithuanian Military Agreement was signed on the 28th October,despite some difficulty over the size and location of the garrison which the Sovietproposed to keep at Vona. A Soviet garrison of one infantry division and onemechanised brigade is now established in Estonia, and the garrison of Latviawill probably be of the same composition.Hungary.28. Since the Soviet occupation of Poland several incidents have taken placejn Euthenia. These include the hoisting of a red flag outside some militarybarracks, shooting between two peasant groups, one of which was agitating forunion with Bussia, an attempted march of malcontents into Soviet-occupiedPoland and the distribution of pro-fiussian propaganda leaflets.Italy and Italian Possessions.?9- The demobilisation of certain classes of reservists; although not yetdefinitely confirmed, and the withdrawal of units from the Italo-french frontierindicate that Italian defensive measures continue to be gradually relaxed.
It has recently been disclosed from an official source that the Italian Armyreorganization commenced about December 1938 has not yet been completed in ailits details. The experience of two months of mobilization has also revealeddeficiencies in armament and equipment, showing that the Italian Army wasnot adequately prepared for war on a European scale. These circumstances mayhave hastened the removal of Pariani from the dual post of Chief of the ArmyStaff and Under-Secretary of State for War, capable soldiers (Graziani and Soddurespectively) being appointed to each of these posts. The allotment of additional funds for military expenditure over the next few years is a further indication that preparedness for war may now be pressed on with greater vigour.30. In Italian overseas possessions the military situation remains generallyunchanged. Operations against the rebels are proceeding in Italian East Africa,as is normal at this season of the year. In Libya the military garrison appears tobe at war strength. The arrival of 20.000 more colonists, the bulk in Cihenaica,is, however, estimated to increase the potential man-power for military duty byabout 4,000 men.The Balkan States and Turkey.31. The approach of winter reduces the likelihood of military operations on a large scale, and both Yugoslavia and Greece appear to be discharging some ofthe reservists previously called to the colours.Roumania and Bulgaria do not, however, appear to have relaxed militaryErecautions. Roumania is still apprehensive of Russia, and the greater part ofer army remains concentrated in her eastern districts. Bulgaria still professesto fear Turkey&apos;s intentions. The decision to hake the number of Turkish troopsin Thrace during November may, however, lessen Bulgarian suspicions and leadto an improvement in Turko-Bulgar relations.Far East.Withdrawal of British garrison from North China.32. The withdrawal of the British battalion from Tientsin and Pektn andits replacement by token forces from Shanghai wiB begin as soon as the british ambassador has told the Japanese Government of our intention.Operations.33. Apart from some troop and staff movements which may presage a-landing in the Pakhoi area of South China, there have been no important militaryoperations during the week. In the political sphere, however, the Japanese,under the direction and incentive of the Army, are working assiduously on their plans for establishing a &quot; puppet&quot; Central Government for occupied China.The morale of Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Government remains good, but is likely to be influenced by the attitude of the Democratic Powers towards Japan.The restrictive and discriminatory measures employed by the Japanesetowards British nationals at the barriers to the British Concession at Tientsinremain as intolerable as ever.-----At Shanghai terrorists of the Japanese-sponsored regime have been lessactive.AIR SITUATION.German Air Force.Movement of-Bomber Forces.34. No movements of bomber forces have been identified during the past week. Rumours of large concentrations in North-West Germany have beencurrent, but no faith need be placed in these rumours, which vary in degree and location from day to day. A reconnaissance of the Heligoland Bight on the30th October showed that the distribution of coastal units on the Island of Syltwas normal, and a few aerodromes seen inland appeared empty. There is no necessity for the German air force to concentrate prior to an attack, and in the attacks during the past fortnight bombers have come from units as far south asErfurt, south-west of Leipsig.
A further reason for treating reports of large concentrations in the coastalbelt with reserve is to be found in the flooded state of some of the aerodromes inthis area. It will be some time before the runways which are now being constructed will be finished.35. From the 26th-28th October there was activity in the Baltic, which appeared to indicate that some form of combined operations between aircraft andsurf ace craft were being practised.German Air Operations.36. In the North Sea area the Germans have continued their routinereconnaissance flights with coastal aircraft located in the Heligoland Bightarea. On one of these flights three German aircraft machine-gunned H.1LS.Franklin off the Goodwin Sands, and on another occasion the 7th destroyer flotilla was attacked 110 miles east of Spurn Head. A single German aircraft on a third occasion dropped two bombs near an East Coast convoy.37. On the Western Front German reconnaissance aircraft flew over theNancy-Strasbourg area on the night of the 27th October, and during the dayof the 30th October the Germans carried out numerous flights west of the Vosgesand over the regions Franco-Belgian frontier, south of Maubeuge, Mezteres,Laon, Rheims, Nancy, Bar-le-Ddc and Revigny. The plotted positions of theGerman aircraft which took part in the reconnaissance flights along the Franco-&apos; Belgian border reported in last week&apos;s resumed, show that these aircraft flew overBelgian territory.German A aircraft Industry.38. In Ministry of Economic Warfare Paper No. 1/51 it was estimatedthat the total monthly output of all types of aircraft in Germany, which was1,000 on the outbreak of war, would rise to 2,400 within the first twelve months.This calculation was based on the maximum output of the existing german aircraft industry, and it was recognised that a further increase could be obtainedif new factories were established.Indications that such an expansion is taking place are given by advertise-ments appearing in German newspapers. The Junkers factory at Schonebeck,which has hitherto been producing aero-engines, advertised on the 15th Octoberfor tool designers for their newly established pressing works for airframes.On the same day the Heinkel Works at Rostock advertised for a number ofbuilding foremen and architects, from which it appears that an expansion of thefactory is a&quot;bout to be undertaken.The Arado Factory at Potsdam is also advertising for preliminarycalculators interested in series preparation and preliminary calculation of newlydeveloped aircraft types. They also require lay-out workers with long experience in aircraft construction for the observation of the assembly of prototypes.An advertisement has also appeared for works&apos; engineers, layout workers,buyers, foremen, &amp;c, for an aircraft works in former Polish territory.Taking these factors into account, together with the &quot; sheltering &quot; of theindustry from the effects of mobilisation, and the increasing amount of femalelabour which has been drafted into it, it appears that the estimate of german aircraft production is likely to be fully realised.French Air Force.Organisation of 1st Air Army.39. There have been changes both in the organisation and command of theAir Force in the Metropole. The First Air Army has now been formed into three zones, the zone Sud (headquarters provisionally at Besancon) having been added to the zones Nord and Est.Operations,Reconnaissance.40. Five missions were carried out on the 25th October and one on the27th October over the Saar and Rhine. They met with active AA resistance.On the 30th October French reconnaissance aircraft made seven day-flights at
high altitudes over the Rhine, Moselle, Black Forest and Upper Danube areas.Fighter aircraft carried out a total of sixteen patrols. Bad weather, however,prevented flying during the greater part of the week.Flights near the Belgian frontier.41. French pilots had, until recently, received orders not to operate in abelt 50 kilometres from the Belgian frontier (so as to avoid any possibility oftheir infringing Belgian neutrality) and not to engage single reconnaissance aircraft. It is understood that these orders have now been cancelled, and thatsingle reconnaissance aircraft are to be attacked and followed right up to theBelgian frontier. Great care, however, is to be taken not to cross the border,and in view of the difficulty of engaging single reconnaissance aircraft operatingat great heights fighter patrols are being instituted over points of special importance, e.g., Maubeuge, Hibson, Mezieres, Verdun and the important rail-way communication centres St. Quentin-La Fere-Laon-Chauny.Production.42. The production of fighters in France is reported by the French mission to be over 250 a monthRoyal Air Force Operations.Tighter Command.43. Aircraft of Fighter Command have made a total of 56 patrols during theweek to investigate reported and doubtful movements of enemy aircraft off the east coast. Enemy reconnaissance aircraft were encountered on the following three occasions: On the morning of the 27th October German aircraft were reported to be approaching Grimsby at 20,000 feet. Three fighters which had been sent up to investigate intercepted a Heinkel III at 17,000 feet 17 miles south-east ofGrimsby; there was an engagement from which the Heinkel escaped by divinginto clouds. At 6-30 a.m. on the 29th October a single aeroplane was detectedapproaching the Firth of Forth at 12,000 feet. It crossed Scotland, went out to sea over the Clyde, and returned again over Glasgow ; during the course ofthe night the height of the enemy aeroplane varied between 2.000 feet and20.000 feet. It was eventually intercepted by Aiwriliaiy fighter pilots betweenGlasgow and Edinburgh and brought down near Dalkeith. On the 30th Octoberanother single enemy aircraft was identified near North Berwick, andintercepted by fighter aircraft. The latter were not, however, able to make contact owing to low visibility and the enemy&apos;s escape into clouds.Bomber Command.Operations against the German Fleet.44. On the 30th October a striking force of bomber aircraft, which has beenheld ready to attack units of the German Fleet in the North Sea, took off toattack five enemy destroyers which were reported to be in a position 26 milesXN.E. of Bohkum. Clouds and visibility were low, and after a 45 minutes&apos;sweep of the reported position the force was unable to locate any target. all aircraft returned safely.Reconnaissances and Leaflet dropping.45. On the night of the 27th-28th October five Whitley aircraft droppedleaflets in the area Munich-Xcbemburg-Frankfurt-Stuttgart. On the30th October six Blenheim aircraft left this country on a daylight visual andphotographic reconnaissance of aerodromes in North-West Germany and to reportsay concentrations of merchant shipping or small craft in the estuaries of theRivers Ems, Jade, Weser and Elbe and elsewhere along this coast. All aircraftexcept one returned safely. Another reconnaissance was made by bomber aircraftuom this country on the &quot;night of the 31st Oetober-lst November of estuaries andTlTers in North-West Germany.
Advanced Air Striking Force.46. On the 30th- October, No. 1 (Fighter) Squadron at Yabsikcoubt shot down an enemy bomber; a Dornier 17-A ir Component of the Expeditionary Force.47. Weather conditions during the week hampered the reconnaissance workof the air component. Aircraft of Nos. 50 and 51 Wings have, however, continued the reconnaissance and photography of the British Expeditionary Force area. Inaddition, special reconnaissances have been made of railways and roads in North-West Germany; aircraft landing in England after completion of these tasks.Coastal Command.48. In conditions of bad weather, routine searches, reconnaissances, anti-submarine patrols and escorts to convoys have been maintained by Coastal Com-mand aircraft. These patrols have resulted in the sighting of several neutralmerchant vessels, tankers and trawlers. Aircraft have also sighted nine enemy submarines, five of which were attacked with unknown results. Patrolsencountered enemy air reconnaissances on ten occasions. Three indecisive engage-ments took place.49. On receipt of information that the 7th Destroyer Flotilla was being attacked (30th October) by enemy aircraft 110 miles east of Sptjen Head, nineCoastal Command aircraft were despatched. The enemy disappeared beforeinterception could be made.A ir Unit at Gibraltar.50. A suspected enemy submarine was attacked from the air 70 miles west of Gibraltar on the 26th October without result,51. During the month ending the 29th October, 1939, the activities of aircraft stationed at Gibraltar included 24 sorties on convoy patrol, and49 sorties on anti-submarine patrol.
