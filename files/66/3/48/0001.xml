In the more recent past we have considered in variouspapers possible German and Russian action in the Balkans, and what assistance we could give to Turkey. The one fact which has stood out clearly is that ourpresent resources in the Middle East will not permit us to give substantialsupport to Turkey or Greece against any German and/or Russian threat, unless and until the neutrality of Italy has been assured.2. On the other hand, Germany&apos;s central position in Europe and resources on land and in the air enable her to embark on an offensive in the Balkans atcomparatively short notice. Russia might decide to participate in such a driveor might merely take advantage of the situation to further her own aimselsewhere very probably to the detriment of British interests. Italy&apos;s attitudehas been taken as varying from benevolent neutrality to open hostility. In this paper we have not considered the effect of active Italian participation on our side, which would obviously alter the whole character of our strategy in the balkans and the Middle East.3. We think it is desirable that future French and British policy in theMiddle East should be co-ordinated soon in view of the possibility of the Balkansbecoming a theatre of war in the spring. As a first step we have considered, inthis Paper, what our own policy should be and what on a long-term view weshould do to increase the strength of our resources in the Middle East.4. The review of the various threats which might develop and our possiblecounter-measures is necessarily a somewhat lengthy document, and we have therefore attached it as an Annex to the Paper. In the paragraphs which followwe summarise, for the consideration of the War Cabinet, the conclusions we have drawn from this examination.The Balkans.5. In our report on the subject of Balkan neutrality (PaperNo. W.P. (39) 18) we stated that from a military point of view we should prefer to have-the Balkan Entente neutral so long as Italy also remains neutral. Thisreport was approved by the War Cabinet.*  Again, the recommendation of the* W.M. (39) 15th Conclusions, Minute 6.[20421]D
joint Anglo-French Staffs (Paper No. W.P. (39) 20, approved by the War cabinet at their meeting on the 6th October) was that &quot;in the event of no German attack in South-East Europe, our policy should be to maintain the neutrality of Italy and to consolidate the balkan states into a benevolently neutral bloc.&apos;&apos;Nothing that has happened since has caused us to alter our view that it is toour advantage to keep the war out of the Balkans as long as possible, and toavoid provoking Italian hostility. The paragraphs which follow, therefore, are-written on the assumption that German and/or Russian action forces us to departfrom this attitude.Turkey.6. There are no Balkan Powers capable of offering serious resistance toGermany, except Turkey. We estimate that existing communications mightallow Germany to maintain some 40 divisions on the Turkish and Greek frontiersbetween the Black Sea and Albania, and to operate some 30 squadrons fromBulgarian and Yugoslavian aerodromes. A serious threat to Turkey and Greecemight, therefore, arise at comparatively short notice in the worst case this might take place in a matter of some weeks after the beginning of a Germandrive into the Balkans. Not only have we given a formal guarantee to greece and concluded a military convention -with Turkey, but it would be a serious disadvantage to us if the Germans reached the JEgean or the Bosporus.7. The Turks consider that they can hold their Thracian frontier provided they receive adequate material and some supporting units from the AlliesWe are, however, doubtful whether -they have fully appreciated the weight ofGerman air attack which might be brought against their restricted communica-tions in Thrace, and have no hesitation in saying that the despatch of an allied expeditionary force to Thrace in the face of this threat might be a most hazardousproceeding. At present the assistance in the form of aircraft or other warmaterial that we can offer Turkey for her own forces is limited. Should aGerman attack develop in the near future, therefore, we must do our utmost to send some air and specialist units and it may be necessary for political reasons to accept the military risks involved in the despatch of a small token force toThrace. Later on if there were a stalemate in the West, if Thrace were still held, and if administrative facilities have been developed, we could increase this force with the object of ultimately assuming the offensive. We consider it essential, however, that the Turks should be pressed to develop to the utmostcommunications and aerodromes in Western Turkey, without which we shallbe unable ever to afford them adequate support.8. If the Turks were driven &quot;back across the Bosporus, the consequences would be serious but not disastrous so long as they held on to the southern shore of the Sea of Marmora, which they should be able to do even if deficient incertain items of equipment. In such a situation we could and should assistwith a small Expeditionary Force based on Smyrna in order to sustain Turkishmorale and prevent possible disintegration of their forces.Greece.9. It is estimated that a minimum of 20 to 24 divisions would be essentialto cover Salonika against a determined advance through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria,and to prevent that advance penetrating into the Southern part of the GrecianPeninsula. The Greeks, who could provide 10 ill-equipped and poorly traineddivisions, could not stop a German advance without substantial Allied land and air support. In the present circumstances the scarcity of aerodromes and lack of depth for their defence make it impossible to give adequate air supporteither, to the Greeks or to any Allied forces in the Salonika area. Moreover,the existing port facilities at Salonika would not suffice to maintain an allied force adequate to resist the scale of attack which the Germans could develop,and it is most unlikely that adequate Allied forces could in any case be madeavailable during the first half of 1940.For some time to come it will therefore be doubtful whether the Allies coulddeny Salonika to a strong German attack.   They certainly could not do so by
the Spring of 1940. If Salonika could, not be denied we should, however, try to stop a hostile advance into Southern Greece by holding the line of the EubceanChannel and the Gulf of Corinth, for which a relatively smaller Allied force would be required. In either case it would be necessary for the Greeks to developaerodromes before adequate air support could be given.10. At present we are not in a position to send any forces to Greece. should threat develop in the near future, however, the French may be able to makelimited forces available to help the Greeks. In any event we consider that anyAllied&apos; force sent to Greece should have a defensive role only, and should notbe so large as to prejudice the support we can give to Turkey on whom our defensive plans in the Middle East should be based.Iran and Iraq.11. At the first signs of Russian aggression against Iran, we should haveto provide for the internal security and air defence of the Anglo-Iranian oil-fields and the port of Basra. Initially this might not be a large commitment,but, if the Russian advance progressed, we should be forced to defend Iraq andto protect the Anglo-Iranian oilfields, both for strategic reasons and on accountof our Treaty obligations. It is of particular importance that a Russian advanceshould not be allowed to penetrate far enough to deny us the air bases we should require in Iraq and Turkey in order to strike at the centres of Russian oil production in the Caucasus, the only objectives in Russia open to effective attack.A afghanistan and India.12. Although Russia can only develop a land attack against India as avery long term project, it would be comparatively simple for her to annex thenorthern provinces of Afghanistan. Such action would to some extent increase her ability to attack India by air and would inevitably lead to disturbances intribal territory on the North-West Frontier and perhaps also within India itself.In such circumstances we could not leave India in her present defenceless stateagainst air attack and &quot;might even have to reinforce her with troops.Italian hostility.13. Italian hostility would not fundamentally affect the areas or scale ofGerman and Russian aggression, but we should be faced with serious additionaldifficulties: (a) Our reinforcement route through the Mediterranean would be temporarilyclosed and the route through the Red Sea would be liable to seriousinterruption.(6) We should have to provide for the defence, as well as the internal security,of Egypt, Aden, the Sudan, Somaliland and Kenya.(c) It would be necessary to eliminate the threat to our sea communications from the Dodecanese before we could provide effective support to turkey and Greece.(d) Italian invasion of Greece from Albania might be added to German orRussian attacks in the Balkans.14. In effect, the intervention of Italy against us would completely alter thewhole picture and our first preoccupation in the Middle East and Mediterraneanarea would be the defeat of Italy and the resumption of full use of theMediterranean. We could afford no direct support to Turkey or Greece in thesecircumstances, and our action vis-a-vis German or Russian aggression would haveto be confined to such purely defensive measures as we could take to secure Syria,Palestine and Iraq, and the Persian Gulf.Basis for Planning.15. It is, of course, impossible to foretell the action which Germany willadopt from the Spring of 1940 onwards, but the increase of economic pressure to be expected from our attack on her exports makes a German advance into the balkans by no means improbable. Although Russia may not openly enter thewar on Germany&apos;s side, we have no doubt that she will do all she can to furtherher interests at the cost of our own.  In these circumstances we think that Italy[20421] b 2
will probably remain neutral, but wv cannot afford to ignore tbe possibilityof her entering the war against us. This, as we see it, is the political background. which must at present fonn the basis of our military strategy in the Middle East.At the same time it must be lemembered that our interests in the Middle East,important as they are, are not as important as the security of France and Britain,or of Singapore. Steps to increase our forces in the Middle East must, therefore,not be at the expense of our essential requirements in the West or our ability to defend Singapore. At.the -sme time a show of force in the Middle east would have a salutary political effect there as well as in the Balkans.16. The main factor which governs the building up of a Middle East reserve\s that we cannot operate additional forces in the Middle East until bases and communications have been developed. This administrative development,particularly in respect of land forces, will be a more lengthy process than thejictual concentration of troops and air forces.17. Our policy should, therefore, be to proceed now, without waiting forconcurrence by the French, with the necessary administrative development, butto keep the general strategic situation in the West, the Middle East and theFar East in review and only to concentrate additional forces in the Middle Eastwhen the situation admits and our resources permit.Land Forces.18. We must at all times maintain in Egypt, Palestine, the Sudan, kenya and Aden the minimum forces necessary for the internal security of these territories. Over and above these, we must retain in these countries sufficientforces to defend our essential interests against Italian land attack. With minorexceptions our military forces in these areas are considered adequate for thesetwo purposes except for a deficiency in anti-aircraft units.19. So long as there is the remotest possibility that Italy may one day turnhostile it would be imprudent not to retain somewhere east of that portion of oursea communications which may be closed by Italian action, adequate forces to check Russian aggression in Iran or Iraq. Any forces which eventually operate in these countries would be best based on India, and the administrative develop-ment necessary for this should be put in hand at once.20. If Italy turns hostile there can be no question of sending forces to operate in Thrace or Greece. If, as is more probable, she remains neutral, itwould be uneconomical to retain forces in the if iddle East merely on the scorethat they might be required in Turkey or Greece. In any case, a force of anysize could not operate in the Balkans until considerable administrative prepara-tions, which will take time, had been made. Advanced base facilities in Egyptare necessary, and we should endeavour to get. the Turks to improve their com-munications. Plans for transferring forces from France to the Middle Eastshould be drawn up as soon as the administrative facilities are available and such forces can be spared. It will be necessary to keep under constant review theshipping situation, since the rapid transfer of troops through the Mediterraneanmight impose a big strain.21.   As a general point we would draw attention to the vital importance ofthe shipping factor in connection with overseas expeditions, observing inparticular that for the maintenance and reinforcement of expeditions in south-east Europe, the train on interior lines will always beat the ship on exterior.  Itis already clear that the shipping tonnage available, even on the most favourableI assumptions, for our essential needs in the United Kingdom allows little margini for large scale military commitments overseas.  For this reason alone such com-i commitments should be limited to the absolute minimum essential for the preservationj of vital allied interests.Air Forces.22. With regard to air forces, we cannot at present afford to reinforceEgypt at the expense of Home Defence and the Western Front, even to the extentof providing adequate forces to meet Italian attack, let alone build up reservesagainst the further contingencies we are considering. Some time must elapse before this situation changes.   On the other hand, war might extend into the
Balkans next spring and, if Italy is friendly, we might have to operate air forces from Turkey, Greece and Iraq, instead of from Egypt and the Sudan, Our firstrequirement is, therefore, to increase the mobility&quot; of our existing units and toensure that existing- air facilities on Turkish ana&apos; Greek soil are improved. Itmight, however, be essential to find reinforcements despite our present shortage,and our maintenance facilities would then have to deal with an increased load.As a long-term policy we should aim at building-up our air strength generally in the Middle East to more adequate proportions, and providing, in addition, abase of operations for a proportion of our metropolitan striking force./ . Recommendations.23. We therefore recommend that the following measures for building up our land and air forces in the Middle East should be approved: Land Forces.(i) The development of base organisation in Egypt and Palestine and the gradual accumulation of material reserves for a force of 9 divisions(including the present garrison) should be put in hand at once.(ii) Reserves should be accumulated in India for 3 divisions and mobiletroops for employment in Iraq and Iran. Basra should be developed as a base port for a force of this size.(iii) 1 division should be concentrated early in India and earmarked for thedefence of the Anglo-Iranian oilfields.(iv) An African division should be formed in Kenya from units alreadythere combined with one, and later a second, brigade of the R.W.A.F.F.from West Africa.g(v) An additional battalion of the Sudan Defence Force should be raised,(vi) Until the strategic situation as between the West and the Middle Eastbecomes clearer, we do not recommend the concentration in the middle east of additional formations other than the above, and those whichhave been already ordered there, viz., the first Australian and NewZealand divisions and the 1st Cavalry Division.Air Forces.24. As a policy to be aimed at, we consider that we should build up our airresources in the Middle East on the following programme :--(i) The institution of such measures as can be undertaken to improve the mobility of our existing squadrons in the Middle East to enable themto operate from Turkey or Greece and also Jo handle such limited air reinforcements as we might conceivably bfe forced to find, possibly as early as the Spring of 1940.(ii) The gradual increase of our air forces in the Middle East and India, andthe corresponding base organisation up to the following totals: (a) Mediterranean and Middle East Area (excluding Egyptian and iraq Air Forces).Bomber Squadrons, Heavy*    ......... 4Bomber Squadrons, Medium   ......      ... 8Fighter Squadrons       ............ 10A.G: Squadrons ...      ...      ......... 5t(b) India.:  Bomber Squadrons, Heavy     ......... 2Bomber Squadrons, Medium   ......... 4&quot;Fighter Squadrons       ......      ...      ... 4A.C.

The above requirements are subject to further examination by the Chiefs of Staff.)(iv) An administrative examination should be undertaken and planning should be begun to meet the above requirements and, in addition,the necessary provision of base facilities for a reinforcing group of12 heavy bomber squadrons from the United Kingdom.&apos; authority should be afforded for the immediate inception of such measures as can be undertaken without reducing our resources in the west.(v) The measures which would be required to maintain the Red Sea routeshould be more thoroughly examined by the Commanders-in-Chief andthe possibility of obtaining the co-operation of South African AirForces should be explored.All Services.25.(i) 90 days&apos; war reserves should be authorised for all additional forces which may be added to the strength of the Middle East garrisons,(ii) The overland routes to Egypt should be developed as alternative routesfor maintenance.(iii) The Turks should be induced to develop their air facilities and oom-munications in Thrace and Western Anatolia, and, if necessary,technical advice and assistance should be afforded/26. When the policy to be adopted in the Middle East has been discussed and agreed with the French, the Service Ministries should be instructed toproceed with detailed planning.(Signed)        C. L. N.

Our principal strategic interests in the Middle East are: (a) The Sea Route through the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal,, and theRed Sea to the Far East.The Canal depends for its security on the defence of palestine and Egypt, and the latter country contains the only base from which our fleet can operate in the Eastern Mediterranean.(b) The Anglo-Iranian Oil-fields.The security of these is very much bound up with the integrity of Iran.(c) The North-West Frontier of India.The security of India is largely dependent on the existence ofa friendly and stable Afghan Government.2. Werequiredepthtodefendtheseinterests. Depth can be obtained in turkey and Iraq. Turkey is, in fact, the first line of defence of the Suez Canal against aggression from the north. Similarly, it is from Iraq that we might first checka Russian advance from the Caucasus or the Caspian to the Persian Gulf. Thedefence of Turkey and Iraq therefore is of the greatest military importance to us,quite apart from considerations arising from our treaty obligations and theneed to maintain our prestige in the Moslem world.
The Balkans.German and/or Russian Aggression,3. The considerations affecting a German or Russian advance in the balkans are: (a) Although Roumania is the most attractive objective in the Balkans for both Germany and Russia, the advance, once started, may not stopthere.(b) No Balkan Power is capable of serious resistance, except Turkey.(c) German aggression by itself is possible, but it is unlikely that Russia,would willingly stand aside and see the entire Balkans fall toGermany.(d) Existing road and rail communications in the Balkans would enableGermany to maintain up to 16 divisions against Turkey and about24 divisions against Greece. She might support this force with some30 squadrons of aircraft operating from Bulgarian and Yugoslavianaerodromes, of which the majority could be long-range bombers.It is unlikely that the capacity of the Balkan railways could bemuch increased within, say. six months, but the steady developmentof Balkan communications over a long period would permit of anincrease in the scale of attack.(e) A limited number of Bulgarian formations could still operate, even if allmain communications were being used by German troops.(/) The intervention of Russia would not appreciably increase the potentialscale of attack against Turkish Thrace or Greece. Even if she usedBulgarian ports, the limiting factors would still be the roads and railways of Bulgaria and Southern Yugoslavia, rather than the troopsor aircraft available.A Russian sea-borne expedition against Thrace or the Bosporuswould stand little chance of success in the face of opposition fromTurkish forces supported by British light naval forces.(g) It would be to our advantage to check a German or Russian advance asfar north as possible, but considerations of time and space alonerule out any hope that we could support Roumania, Hungary orYugoslavia except possibly with a limited amount of material.(A) While it is of importance to prevent Germany or Russia reaching the aegean or Sea of Marmora, we must above all ensure that Turkey is&apos; not defeated, since this would seriously threaten our whole positionin the Middle East.Policy agreed with the French.4.   It has already been agreed with the French that: &quot; (i) If Germany does press on (i.e., in the Balkans), we should concentrate on building up our resources in Turkey, backed by our own forces in the levant and Middle East, with a view to forming a military front with turkey in Thrace.(ii) No military commitment should be undertaken at Salonika except at the invitation of Greece and with the prior agreement of Italy. The role of any forces sent to Salonika must be limited to stiffening Greekresistance and must be purely defensive.&quot;(Paper No. C.O.S. (39) 63.)Military Convention with Turkey.5. Under Article 4 of the Turkish Military Convention we are committed in the following terms: &quot; The contracting Governments recognise the importance in the eventof aggression by a third Power of not allowing this third Power to seizeSalonika; and of making the defence against the common enemy in this.- region inter-allied in character from the outset. It is, however, understoodthat the defence, of Greek territory is essentially the task of the greek army.&quot;
/Defence of Turkish Thrace. -6. The Turkish General Staff have, as recently as the 21st October, statedthat they can hold their Thracian frontier against 30 divisions, given technicalaid, material and the assistance of certain supporting units from the Allies. Asfar as can be foreseen, it will not be possible, without interfering considerablywith our own rearmament programme, to supply several important Turkisnrequirements for some time to come. Should a German or Russian advance inthe Balkans start in the near future, however, it may well be necessary for us tomake sacrifices and take risks elsewhere in order to take such measures to supportTurkey as could be implemented at short notice. It is impossible to forecast how long it would take for a German advance in South-East Europe to reach thefrontier of Turkey: it might be only a matter of weeks, it might take months.7. Although the Turks consider that they can hold their frontier withoutthe assistance of allied formations, we think they may be optimistic in thisrespect.It has been clearly demonstrated in Poland that, if troops in defence are notestablished in prepared positions, no amjunt of gallantry on their part will suffice to withstand land attack if that attack is overwhelmingly supported fromthe air. While the strength of the Turkish defences on the Thracian Frontiermay be expected to afford some measure of protection, we should be unwise to rely upon Turkey being able to hold the German advance with her own forcesuniess France and ourselves are able to afford adequate support against theGerman air force.It will be extremely difficult for us to find such support without runningserious risks in the Middle East and possibly also in the West. Nevertheless, wemay be compelled to send such air support as can be made available, even at come degree of risk, particularly in the form of fighters and A.A. weapons to assist inthe defence of Thrace.Moreover, even if the Turks have to fall back east of the Bosphorus, it will still be necessary to provide some air assistance to afford a measure of security against hostile air attack in Western Turkey and to the Fleet base at Smyrna.In either event it will probably be undesirable to base British or French airforces in Thrace, and this emphasises the essential need for the Turks immediately to undertake a considerable measure of aerodrome development in WesternAnatolia, and to improve road and rail communications in that area.6. Turning to the consideration of whether we should send land forces toassist in the defence of Thrace, it is clear that there are serious difficulties anddangers in such a project.First, while the few roads and the one railway in Turkish Thrace may havethe capacity to maintain the 20 to 25 divisions which the Turks intend to deployon their frontier, they would probably not suffice in their present state for an allied expeditionary force in addition.Second, if the Turkish forces were driven out of their prepared positions onthe Thracian frontier, an orderly retreat might be extremely difficult to carryout in the face of heavy air attack, as the war in Poland has clearly shown; and turkish difficulties would be accentuated by the lack of depth and restrictedcommunications.Third, our line of communications to an allied force in Thrace would be via the Dardanelles and Sea of Marmara. This runs practically parallel to the front and would be exceedingly difficult to maintain in face of determined air attack.Moreover, should the Turks not succeed in holding their frontier, the extricationof the force might be impossible.9. We would point out, that up to the present the Turks have made norequest for allied formations in Thrace. Moreover, they are most unwilling toenter into Staff Conversations and adequate preparations for the operations ofan allied force are therefore impossible. At the same time we must face the factthat if and when a serious threat developed in the Balkans, the Turks may make an appeal for assistance which it would be extremely difficult to refuse: &quot;If it then becomes essential, in order to retain Turkey as an Ally, to go to her support,the force despatched should be the minimum required as a token of support.Later on, if there were a stalemate in the West, if Thrace were still held; and if[20421] c
administrative facilities had been developed, we could increase this force withthe object of ultimately assuming the offensive.10. If the Turks were driven back across the Bosphorus, the consequences would be serious but not disastrous, so long as they held on to the Southern shore of the Sea of Marmora, which they should be able to do even if deficient in certain items of equipment. So long as this line were held, free passage through theStraits would be denied to the enemy. In such a situation we could and shouldassist with a small expeditionary force based on Smyrna, in order to sustainTurkish morale and prevent possible disintegration of their forces.11. Above all it should be noted that the degree of assistance we could afford to Turkey in Thrace or Anatolia-whether by land or air or both would mainlydepend upon the extent to which the local communications, aerodromes, &amp;c, hadbeen developed by Turkey. At present these facilities are quite inadequate tomaintain more than extremely limited forces, and their capacity would be absorbed by Turkish forces to a considerable extent. We therefore attach thegreatest importance to the development of communications and aerodromes by turkey, particularly in Western Anatolio.12. We have already informed the Turks that, in the event of russian aggression, we would be ready to furnish naval assistance subject to the provisionby them of adequate local defences at Smyrna and Ismid.Defence of Greece.13. Should the German advance be directed on Greece rather than, or inaddition to, an advance on Turkey, any measure of success which would^seriouslythreaten our sea communications in the Mediterranean and ^gean Seas wouldbe to our grave disadvantage. We have already recorded our opinion that &quot;It is most important that the territory south of the line between theGulf of Corinth and the Euboean Channel should not be overrun.&quot;&apos;The first objective of a German advance into Greece would probably beSalonika. The capture of Salonika would not only give Germany a naval basefroni which she could attack our sea communications, but would be an essential preliminary to a further penetration of Greece.14. It is estimated that a minimum of 20 to 24 divisions would be essentialto cover Salonika against a determined advance through Yugo-Slavia and bulgaria, and to prevent that advance penetrating into the southern part of theGrecian peninsula. It is unlikely that the Greeks could provide more than about10 ill-equipped and poorly-trained divisions for the purpose. A large allied expeditionary Force would therefore be necessary and we should have to providematerial and specialised units to stiffen Greek resistance. The port of Salonikawill not suffice without further development for the maintenance of more than5 or 6 divisions. (The improved facilities provided for the last war have largelydisappeared.) After such development, however, Salonika would maintain *the requisite force.15. On the other hand, any force covering Salonika can only be maintained by sea. through a single base lying within easy reach of aerodromes in hostileterritory capable of operating a considerable force of heavy bombers. Thecountry lends no depth for the air defence of Salonika and there are only threeaerodromes in Northern Greece; for this reason it may well be impossible toprovide the very substantial scale of fighter and anti-aircraft defence that wouldbe essential if a force of any size were to be maintained. In any event, it wouldbe a long time before the necessary forces could be made available.Moreover, Salonika is not a suitable place from which to launch an offensive,since the nature of the country would enable a small enemy force to hold up the advance of a much larger Allied force.16.. Our conclusion, therefore, is that, however desirable it may be to denySalonika to the Germans, the possibility of doing so is doubtful; and, in any event, the necessary resources cannot be provided in the predictable future (and certainly not by the Spring Qf 1940), more particularly as our primary commit-&quot; * C.O.S. (39) 45.
ment in the event of a German advance in the Balkans would be in Turkey, andnot in Greece. Even should it be impossible to defend Salonika, it would still be most desirable to-ensure the defence of Southern Greece. This could best be doneby stopping the eriemy&apos;s advance on the line from the Euboean channel and theGulf of Corinth. Although the Greeks should be able to provide some 16 divisions on this line, there would still be need of an allied force of some 4 to 6 divisionswith adequate air support to ensure that the German advance was finally held up.17. It will be clear from the above that, on a short-term view, to ensurethe defence of Salonika, or even of Southern Greece, would require resources which at present we have not got.18. As a general point we would draw attention to the vital importanceof the shipping factor in connection with overseas expeditions, observing inparticular that for the maintenance and reinforcement of expeditions in South-Eastern Europe the train on interior lines will always beat the ship on exterior.It is already clear that the shipping tonnage available, even on the most favourable assumptions, for our essential needs in the United Kingdom allowslittle margin for large-scale military commitments overseas. For this reasonalone such commitments should be limited to the absolute minimum essential forthe preservation of vital Allied interests.Summary.19.   The conclusions we draw from the above review are: (a) The best method, in the long run, of assisting in the defence of Thraceis. by providing the Turks with the material and equipment they want. Since it is very unlikely that we shall be able to do this in thenear future there is the greater need to make preparations to sendsuch supporting units (Anti-tank, Anti-aircraft, and medium artillery) as we can spare from elsewhere.(6) In view of the lack of communications and the impossibility of providingadequate air support, we should send no force (beyond a fewspecialised units) to assist the Turks in Thrace unless politicalexigencies override military considerations, when the Force shouldbe kept to the minimum necessary to afford a token of support. later on if a situation arises in which an offensive in the Balkans provespossible and communications have been improved, a larger allied expeditionary Force could be provided.(c) The capacity of the communications in Thrace and Western Anatolia,of the Port of Smyrna, and of the aerodromes in Western Anatoliashould be improved. We should press the Turks to put these measures in hand immediately since they take a long time to complete and weshall be unable to give any substantial assistance to the Turks unless they are undertaken.-id) We should make plans to provide air support based on WesternAnatolia and to despatch a small expeditionary force to be based onSmyrna.(e) The essential conditions governing the despatch of an expedition adequate to defend Salonika are the availability of forces and shipping, thedevelopment of the port itself and the communications running inlandfrom it, and the friendliness of Italy. Even if all these conditions were favourable, the feasibility of maintaining an expeditionary force would still be extremely doubtful in view of the inevitable concentra-tion of resources at the one port of Salonika, the paucity of aerodromes and the lack of depth available for air defence.(f) If it proves impossible, as it may well do, to defend Salonika, we should still try to stop a hostile advance on the line of the Euboean channel and the Gulf of Corinth. For this the Allies would have to providea force of from 4 to 6 divisions. The Greeks, for their part, wouldhave to develop the necessary aerodromes in Southern Greece inaddition to providing military forces.(g) On a short-term view, the defence of Salonika, or even of SouthernGreece, would require resources in excess of those we have at present or are likely to have in the near future.[20421] q
Russian Aggression outside the Balkans.20. Apart from the Balkans, Russia could attack Turkey in the Caucasusand British interests in India, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. As we said in a previous report, however, &quot; in spite of her great man power and natural resources, we do not consider that Russia is likely to embark on active hostilitieswhich are liable to lead to a heavy military commitment.....She may welldoubt the capacity of her military forces to sustain large-scale operations againsta first-class Power outside Russian territory &quot; (CCS. (39) 69, paragraph 7).There is, therefore, a limit to the extent to which the possible threats ofRussian action, which we discuss below, can be developed.Caucasus.21. The difficult nature of the country in the Caucasus would precludeRussia from attacking Eastern Anatolia with more than some 10 divisions.Since there are few important objectives in Eastern Turkey, Russian action would probably be designed to lock up Turkish forces in Anatolia or to gaindepth for the Russian air defence in front of Baku. Turkey should require nohelp on land from the Allies in this area, except perhaps for a few technical units.On the other hand, practically all the Russian centres of oil production lie in the Caucasus. These, together with the ports through which oil can be transported to the Danube, are within range of modern bomber aircraft based onEastern Turkey and Iraq. The attack on her oil resources is practically the only means of bringing considerable pressure to bear upon Russia. Moreover, one ofthe two main lines of communication to any Russian forces concentrated againstAfghanistan runs through Baku. In the event of Russian aggression, we shall require to operate air striking forces from Iraq and Turkey against objectives inthe Caucasus. It is extremely important, therefore, that a Russian advance onthis front should not be allowed to penetrate far enough to deny us the requisiteair bases in Eastern Turkey and Iraq.Iran and Iraq.22. Russian aggression in Iran might take the form of an advance onTabriz with five or six divisions, or^ seaborne expedition across the Caspianwith Teheran as an objective, or a combination of both these courses. Thiswould bring ibe Anglo-Iranian oilfields within reach of Russian bombers, andwe should have H^provide the necessary fighter and AA. defence. We considerthat a minimum^! one fighter squadron would be necessary in the neighbour-hood of Abada^I^Moreover, Russian air action, combined with propaganda,might cause dissefrsron both in Iran and Iraq, and at the first signs of a russian advance we stoswl^ievefore, have to take steps to. ensure the security of the oilfields and the^^fO? Basra. We estimate that one division would be requiredfor this purpose^^fte first instance.23. ExcepYif^Siaps for a minor diversion across the Iraqi frontier atRuwanduz, a fuk^fS^Russian advance would have to follow the Hamadan-Kermanshah roao/^jwards Iraq or the trans-Iranian railway towards Abadan,and must necessarily be slow. The communictions would severely limit the size of the advancing forces. On the other hand, we have both to defend the Iraqifrontier in order&quot; to secure our air bases in the plain, to protect the Anglo-Iranian oilfields and to ensure internal security in Iraq. Ultimately, therefore,we might have to employ not less than three divisions in a defensive role.A afghanistan and India.24. Russia cannot develop a land attack against India except as a very. long-term project, but she has ample resources on the spot to annex the northernprovinces of Afghanistan, and she could bring air attack to bear on afghanistan and Northern India. Such action on her part would certainly be accompaniedby a vigorous propaganda campaign and might endanger the security of theAfghan Government. Moreover, this situation would almost certainly lead todisturbances in tribal territory on the N.W. Frontier and perhaps also withinIndia itself. In such circumstances India would cease to be source of reserves and would, in fact, become a liability in so far as air.defence is concerned. At
IBpresent Russia does not maintain many heavy bombers in the Central Asianmilitary district, and the scale of air attack which she could direct on to india would probably hot be very heavy initially. Nevertheless, we could not possiblyleave India in her present defenceless state against air attack. We are therefor of the opinion that we should be prepared to provide A.A. defences and to buildup to a total of not less than six bomber squadrons, four fighter squadrons and four army co-operation squadrons for the defence of North-West India against air attack.. Italian Hostility.25. If Germany openly declared her intention of carrying the war intothe Balkans in order to enforce her economic demands, Italy could not remainindifferent. She has already associated herself with the Balkan bloc, and hersympathy for Germany has decreased in proportion to the latter country&apos;s supportof Russian demands. Much would depend upon whether Russia participatedopenly in a Balkan drive, and what line of advance Germany adopted. Anyinvasion of Yugoslavia must, however, greatly increase the chance of Italianintervention on behalf of the Allies. We have not, however, taken account ofthis possibility in this examination since such action on the part of Italy wouldcompletely change our strategy against Germany. In fact we are still in theposition of having to consider the possibility of Italian hostility aud the following paragraphs are based on this hypothesis.26. Italian hostility would not fundamentally affect the areas or scale of Russian and German aggression outlined above, but we should be faced withthe following additional difficulties: (a) Our reinforcement route through the Mediterranean would be temporarilyclosed and the route through the Red Sea would be liable to interruption-tion which might be serious. The overland routes from Basra to palestine, and from Mombasa to Egypt, have not sufficient capacity to enable us to maintain our existing garrisons in Egypt and Palestine,let alone any additional forces.(&amp;) We should have to provide for the defence, as well as for the internal security, of Egypt. Aden, the Sudan, Somaliland and Kenya.(c) It would be necessary to eliminate the threat to our sea communications from the Dodecanese before we could provide effective support to turkey or Greece.(d) Italian invasion of Greece from Albania might be added to Germanand/or Russian attacks in the Balkans.27. In effect, the intervention of Italy against us would completely alter the whole picture and our first preoccupation in the Middle East and mediterranean area would be the defeat of Italy and the resumption of full useof the Mediterranean. We could afford no direct support to Turkey or Greecein these circumstances, and our action vis-a-vis German or Russian aggressionwould have to be confined to such purely defensive measures as we would take to secure Syria, Palestine and Iraq and our interests-in the Persian Gulf.The Red Sea.28. The war reserves authorised for, but not yet accumulated in the middle east should suffice to maintain the forces we now have in Egypt for a periodof 3 months of war. Moreover, we might expect that even in the early stages,it wouid^bejDossible to pass occasional convoys through the Red Sea, and a limitedcontribution would be possible via the overTancTT^utes] On tne other hancTltis clear that, apart altogether from undertaking operations in Thrace or elsewhere,we must secure our Red Sea communication if we are to maintain our positionin Egypt.29. It is the Italian naval and air forces operatiohg from Italian EastAfrica which would threaten our Red Sea communications. The air threat wouldprobably be the greater, although both would be wasting efforts. Subject, there-fore, to the retention in Egypt of the minimum air forces essential to preserve thesecurity of that country, we should have to concentrate the remainder against[20421] d 2
East Africa. At present there are not adequate air forces for use in East Africa,and we should, therefore, explore the possibility of obtaining South Africa&apos;sco-operation in this theatre. The raising of the tribes in Ethiopia against theItalians would have a diversionary effect on the Italian Air Force, and compre^hensive preparations for this are being made. An additional battalion of theSudan Defence Force is, however, required to support, and to control the issueof equipment to the tribes. At the same time no guarantee that the Red Sea com-munications will be free from serious interruption within a period of threemonths can be given. Overland communications to Egypt, should, therefore, be developed as supplementary routes for maintenance.30. The possibility of reducing the Italian scale of air attack in italian east Africa by means of a land offensive from French Somaliland has been examined. An offensive of this nature would require the concentration of aconsiderable body of troops. A concentration of this size, prior to the outbreak ofwar, would be contrary to our present policy of avoiding any course which mightbe considered provocative by Italy; after the outbreak of war it would behazardous until the scale of Italian air attack had been considerably reducedwhen the need for it would have passed. Moreover, a land offensive into EastAfrica could not be effective in time to be of value. Apart from these considera-tions there is little doubt that the necessary specialist units, e.g., air squadrons,anti-aircraft units, tank and anti-tank units, &amp;c, could not be made available.The whole question of clearing the Red Sea route requires further examination by the Commanders on the spot.Local Defence of Egypt and the Sudan.31. The land forces at present in Egypt and the Sudan (approximately two divisions, an armoured division and the Sudan Defence Force) are consideredadequate to defend our essential interests in these countries against Italianattack. We are, however, at present still short in respect of air forces andAA. units. These are, therefore, our immediate requirements.Local Defence in East A frica.32. The Italians have some seven divisions in East Africa which could notbe reinforced while we held the Suez Canal. Internal security requirements andthe nature of the country would probably preclude the use of more than oneMetropolitan division for attack on French and British possessions, and localresources would limit the duration of the offensive. We think that we should bejustified, therefore, in taking reasonable risks in the Sudan, Kenya and Somali-land, in so far as they do not involve giving up bases required for operations to reopen the Red Sea. We estimate that the Sudan Defence Force and one regularbrigade, with the addition of one battalion, would be sufficient for essentialdefensive purposes in the Sudan, and the King&apos;s African Rifles and one brigade of the R.W.A.F.F. in Kenya. Somaliland would not be reinforced, unless it became necessary to stage an offensive from Djibuti.Italian Threat from Libya.33. Before we could undertake operations for the support of Turkey orGreece we should have to secure our base in Egypt and the fleet base at alexandria. The necessary degree of security could not be obtained until the threat from Libya had been removed. This could best be achieved by land and air operations from Tunisia combined with naval action against Italy&apos;s sea communications. Owing to the difficulties of the country, action.by land forcesin Egypt would only be of a diversionary nature, and air action would be limitedto that which was necessary to ensure the defence of Egypt.The Dodecanese.34. The removal of the threat of Italian action from the Dodecanese shouldbe well within our capacity if, by the time we are required to undertake it, our air resources in the Middle East can be reinforced in adequate strength, and provided that we can operate from Turkish bases in conjunction with the Fleet.Although the Anatolian railways cannot maintain any but small allied land
forces in Turkey, it would be possible to- establish and maintain the air forcesnecessary for this purpose. There are too many uncertain factors to assess how long this operation might take. .....Building Up of a Meddle East Reserve.Need for increasing our Forces.35. Our forces in the Middle East, in co-operation with the French, are sufficient, apart from a weakness in air forces and anti-aircraft artillery, tosecure our interests against Italian attack alone. We should, however, requireadditional land and air forces to defend our interests, and to prevent the defeat of Turkey, if Germany and/or Russia commenced determined offensive operations in the Middle East. If Italian hostility was combined with German and russian aggression, the situation would not necessarily call for further increases, but itwould affect the method and order of employment of our forces, because weshould have to deaj with Italian theatres of war before any assistance to Turkeyor Greece was possible.Policy.36. Our interests in the Middle East, important as they are, are not as important as the security of France and Britain or of Singapore. Steps toincrease our forces in the Middle East must therefore not be at the expense ofour essential requirements in the West or our ability to defend Singapore. Atthe same time a show force in the Middle East would have a salutary political effect there as well as in the Balkans.37. The main factor which governs the building up of a Middle Eastreserve is that we cannot operate additional forces in the Middle East until bases and communications have been developed. This administrative development,particularly in respect of land forces, will be a more lengthy process than theactual concentration of troops and air forces.38. Our policy should, therefore, be to proceed now with the necessary administrative development, but to keep the general strategic situation in theWest, the Middle East and the Far East under review and only to concentrateadditional forces in the Middle East when the situation demands and our resources permit.Land Forces.Scale of Administrative Development Required.39. It is impossible to foresee exactly the land forces we may need to employin the Middle East in the event of German, Russian or Italian aggression. Thefollowing is, however, an estimate intended to form a basis for administrativeplanning: (i) For the defence of Egypt and the Sudan 2 divisions, 1 armoured division and Sudan Defence Force.(ii) For the internal security of Palestine, Egypt and the Sudan, includingthe defence of the Suez Canal 17 battalions or equivalent units.(iii) For the defence of Iraq and the Anglo-Iranian oilfields 3 divisions and mobile troops in India.(iv) For the defence of Trans-Jordan, Somaliland and Kenya Local forces and one brigade E.WAF.F.(v) As a central reserve in Egypt or Palestine, available for use in the middle east at short notice 3 divisions.Say, a total of L2 divisions.
Areas in which Administrative Development is Required.40. As regards the areas in which administrative developments arerequired, there can be little doubt that the majority of our land forces would be most suitably based on Egypt or Palestine. Base development is required in this area, therefore, for the equivalent of 9 divisions and also the development of theoverland routes to Egypt.41. There are, however, advantages in supplying forces required for use inIraq and Iran from India, sinoe (a) The Red Sea route might be interrupted at a critical period, whereas thePersian Gulf would be less liable to interference.(6) India possesses armament resources and a manufacturing capacity whichhave no counterpart in Egypt and Palestine,(c) Shipping is usually available in Indian ports.Our requirements here are for the accumulation of reserves in India for three divisions and mobile troops, and the development of communications in Iraq andthe port of Basra to an extent which would enable them to be used at short noticefor a force of that size.42. A brigade, and when available a second brigade, of the Royal west african Frontier Force should be transferred to Kenya, which would be the mostsuitable location with a view to its possible employment in the Middle East.Existing facilities at Mombasa should be ample, but the building up of thenecessary reserves in Kenya is desirable when resources permit.43. If possible, the Turks should be pressed to develop their communications in Thrace and, in particular, in Western Anatolia.Concentration of A additional Troops.44. The considerations which should govern the concentration of additionaltroops in the Middle East, as opposed to the development of administrativefacilities, are: (a) We have still only a small army in France, and the Germans may launch a major offensive on that front in the spring. We are not, therefore,in a position to increase our Middle East forces at the cost of those inthe United Kingdom or France.(6) While Italy is neutral, we can send troops through the Mediterraneanor Red Sea, but, so long as her attitude is doubtful, we are runninga risk in not maintaining a reserve in the Middle East or India, since we may have to meet the additional commitments discussed in this paper.\c) If Italy were hostile, we could not operate in Thrace or Greece evenif we had the necessary troops available in the Middle East.(d) The country precludes major land operations from Egypt against Libya,so that a reserve in Egypt is not required simply for that purpose.(e) Although it would be possible to move a reserve from Egypt to Iraqby overland route, should a threat in that area mature, it would subsequently have to be maintained from India.(/) Egypt is probably a better training ground than India for any Australianor New Zealand divisions which may become available in the nearfuture.(g) The availability of shipping and escorts is a limiting factor in con-sidering the policy which should govern the provision of any forces required for operations in Turkey or Greece. It is essential that the move should be so arranged as to make the minimum demands inthese respects. This necessitates the concentration area being situatedas close as, possible to the scene of operations, and the concentrationbeing spread out over as long a period as possible.
45.   Taking all these factors into account, we conclude that:  .(i) One division should be concentrated early in India and earmarked forthe defence of the Anglo-Iranian oilfields,(ii) An African division should be formed in Kenya from units already there,combined with one, and later a second, brigade of the R.W.A.F.F.from West Africa. J(nil An additional battalion of the Sudan Defence Force should be raised.(iv) Until the strategic situation as between the West and the Middle Eastbecomes clearer, no further formations should be concentrated in theMiddle East beyond those already ordered there, viz., the firstAustralian and New Zealand divisions, and the 1st Cavalry division.Air Forces.Policy to Govern the Building Up of Air Resources for the Middle East.46. Any increase in our air strength overseas can only be made-at theexpense of the Air Force in the United Kingdom or France. We are still far short of our requirements in all classes in the Metropolitan area; although weare embarking on an ambitious programme of air expansion, it will be a long time before we can spare aircraft or personnel for the Middle East without perpetu-ating a position of dangerous numerical inferiority in the West.The priority to be accorded to air requirements in different theatres mustbe kept under constant review, and decisions to form or despatch squadronsoverseas must be made from time to time in the light of the situation as itdevelops.47. As a policy to be aimed at, we consider that we should build up our airresources in the Middle East on the following programme : (a) The institution of such measures as can be undertaken to improve the mobility of our existing squadrons in the Middle East to enable themto operate from Turkey or Greece, and also to handle such limited air reinforcements as we might conceivably be forced to find, possibly as early as the Spring of 1940.(6) The gradual increase of our air forces in the Middle East and India andthe corresponding base organisation up to the following totals: (i) Mediterranean and Middle East Area (excluding Egyptian and- Iraq Air Forces).Bomber Squadrons, Heayy*     ...      ......       4(ii) India.Bomber Squadrons, MediumFighter Squadrons.A.C. Squadrons  ......8105tBomber Squadrons, Heavy      ...... 2Bomber Squadrons, Medium    .........       4Fighter Squadrons       ...     -.........       4A.C. Squadrons...............       4J(The provision of fighter squadrons is the most importantrequirement for India.)(c) The provision, as soon as resources will permit, of shore base, storage anddepot facilities for the following: (i) To co-operate with the Navy in the Mediterranean or Bed Sea : GJL F./Bt. Squadrons.........      ... .3G.E. Landplane Squadrons     ......... 4T.B./G.R. Squadron............ 1(ii) The F.A.A complement of 2 aircraft carriers, amounting to atotal of 6 squadrons, with the necessary reserves.(Note. The above requirements are subject to further examination by the Chiefs of Staff.)g Tli is recommendation is at present under discussion between the War Office and theColonial Office and is therefore provisional. -* Also available for troop transport,f Or according to strength of army in the area.% Including India Air Force.
48. An administrative examination should be undertaken and planning should be begun to meet the above requirements, and, in addition, the necessary provision of base facilities for a reinforcing group of 12 heavy bomber squadronsfrom the United Kingdom. Authority should be afforded for the immediateinception of such measures as can be undertaken without reducing our resources in the West.Everything possible should be done to induce the Turkish Government toimprove aerodrome facilities in Turkey, and, if necessary, technical advice and assistance should, be offered.Miscellaneous Considerations.49. A scale of 90 days&apos; war reserves for existing troops in the Middle Easthas already been approved by the War Cabinet. This same scale will be requiredfor any further forces which may be built up.50.   The&quot;.detailed calculations for the development of the administrative &quot;facilities we require will necessarily be the work of the Departments concerned.The following factors would, however, appear to merit consideration when thosecalculations are made : (a) The existence of local resources, e.g., in Egypt or Palestine.(b) The possibility of expanding Indian factories and developing SouthAfrican or other resources East of Suez.
