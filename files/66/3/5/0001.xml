WEEKLY REPORT NO,8 OP AIR OPERATIONST-        AND INTELLIGENCE FOR THE WEEK ENDINGMIDNIGHT 29TH OCTOBER, 1959.GERMAN AIR FORCE.1. No movementb of German bomber squadrons have beenestablished during the week though there have been repeatedrumours of large bomber concentrations in north-west Germany.A concentration of ten squadrons of twin-enginedfighters (Messerschmidt 110) has been identified in the Colognearea, additional to the light fighter squadrons (Messerschmidt109) already stationed there.     It is of interest also that anumber of large aerodromes in the Ruhr area have been vacatedby training schools, and the aerodromes are, therefore, ready for use by bomber aircraft attshort notice.     The identificationof long-range reconnaissance aircraft near the Dutch frontieragain attracts attention to this area;   the movements are consistent with possible preparations for an attack acrosBHolland.Activity In the area of the Baltic during the past few days would appear to indicate that combined opera.ionsbetween aircraft and surface craft are being practised.FRENCH AIR FORCE.2.      Bad weather in France has curtailed air activity,but in the middle of the week the French made some usefulreconnaissance flights.     German aircraft have penetratedfarther into France than before.     The inference drawn by theFrench Staff from these flights, and from others made sincethe outbreak of war, is that the German Air Force has been making reconnaiBEances of possible bombing targets, e.g,industrial objectives in. the districts of Valenciennes, LowerSeine, Creusot, and Lyons, and also the air force depots

; -2--v-   / &quot;.-r-     ; &apos; V-at Romllly and Chateaudun.The French First Air Array has now been sub-dividedInto three zones, namely Nord, Est and Sudj   it is not yet known what air force units have been allotted to zone Sud.General Fennes, who was commanding the zone Est,has been appointed to the command of the.air force in north africa and has been succeeded in command of the zone Est byGeneral Tetu.   General Eousoat, lately commanding in north africa, will take over from General Tetu as Chef de l*Etat-Major at General Vuillemin-s Headquarters.ROYAL AIR FORCE OPERATIONSFIGHTER COMMAND3.      Enemy Reconnaissances.   There have been no attemptedbomber attacks by German aircraft during the week, butreconnaissance aircraft have been encountered on two occasions on the morning of the 27th October five German aircraftapproached Grimsby at,.20,000 ft.   Three fighters which hadbeen sent up to investigate intercepted a Heinkel III at17,000 ft., seventeen miles south-east of Grimsby;   there was an engagement from which the Heinkel escaped by diving intoclouds.   At 8.30 a.m. on the 29th October a single aeroplanewas detected approaching the Firth of Forth at 12,000 ft.It crossed Scotland, went out to sea over the Clyde, and returned again over Glasgow:   during the course of the flightthe height of the enemy aeroplane varied between 2,000 ft. and20,000 ft.   It was eventually intercepted by Auxiliary fighterpilots between Glasgow and Edinburgh and forced down nearDalkelth.4.      Patrols.     The investigation by Fighter command aircraft of doubtful enemy aircraft movements during the weekled to a total of 58 patrols involving 162 fighters:   the only

interceptions made were those referred to in paragraph above.5.        Movements.    There are now four squadrons of 8-gunfighters in the Forth-Clyde area for the protection of theFleet.    Arrangements are in being whereby additional fighterreinforcements can be moved rapidly to the area if continuousheavy attacks should develop.6.        Balloons.      It was decided on the 27th October thata balloon barrage should be established in the Greenock areaof the Forth:   17 balloons were flying by mid-day on the 29thOctober.BOaBER COMMAND7.        Operations against the German Fleet.   A striking force of bomber aircraft has been held ready to attack unitsof the German fleet in the North Sea;   reconnaissance aircraft have not, however, reported any targets judged suitable fornttac-i.8. 1      Propaganda Campaign.     On the night of 24/25thOctober leaflets containing an extract from the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech were dropped over the area Berlin-Hamburg-Magdeburg:the aircraft engaged returned safely.     The broadcasting ofRibbentrop&apos;s Danzig speech, which was being made while theoperation was in progress, was suddenly interrupted, possiblybecause of the giving of air raid warnings in Germany.     Onthe same day six aeroplanes had flown to France with the objectof dropping leaflets over areas in southern Germany.     Because .of unfavourable weather the flight did not take place untilthe night of the 27/28th October, when five aircraft droppedleaflets in the area Munich-Nuremburg-Frankfurt-Stuttgart.

One of the aeroplanes made a forced landing on its return owingto ice accretion:   the aeroplane caught fire, but the crewescaped and the fire was extinguished;   another aeroplane crashedin flames on the Argonne, but the crew of five landed safely byparachute.   No opposition was encountered during the flightsover northern and southern Germany, but searchlights were active.9.      A Whitley V bomber aeroplane which left to make a night reconnaissance of north-west Germany on the 24th Octoberfailed to returns   it was last heard about 60 miles eaBt ofFlamborough Head on the homeward journey, and a subsequent searchfound no trace of the miBsing bomber.COASTAL COMMAND.10.       In conditions of bad weather routine searches,reconnaissances, anti-submarine patrols, and the escorting of convoys have been maintained.   A large number of merchant vessels and some mines have been reported, and six U-boats have beenBighted.   Of the submarines sighted, four were attacked, withoutdefinite result.   One of the attacks, which forced the U-boat tosubmerge, was delivered when the submarine was in theneighbourhood of a merchant vessel.11.       Two matters of interest arising out of coastal command activities may be mentioned:(i)   an extended but unsuccessful effort was madeIn northern waters to locate the &quot;City ofFlint&quot; before it was known to have reachedMurmansk;(ii)   a special reconnaissance was made in toeneighbourhood of Rockall Island to tracewhat was suspected to be a German armedraider accompanied by three other ships:the vessels were found but were identified as British merchant ships.

Because of unfavourable weather only one reconnaissance.of north-west Germany has been attempted:     this was made bydaylight and no anti-aircraft gun fire or enemy fighters were encountered:     cloudy conditions prevailed during the flight.     Nounusual activity was reported.
