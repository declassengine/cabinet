We have^had under consideration a letter from theForeign Office   referring -to General Weygand1s activities inthe Balkans and. tilddlo 3ajt.   The Foreign Office express their concern &amp;t tius part played by General v/eygand in therecent Anglo-French- -I^arMsfc. discussions at Angora,General Worgand-c policy a      *-2.        In these discussions General Weygand recommended secretconsultations with the Greeks regarding the possibledespatch of Allied forces to Salonika, and that Frenchofficers should go to Greece in plain clothes to work outdetails with the Greek General Staff.     General Weygandfurther suggested secret negotiations with the Yugoslavsand the Roumanians regarding their lines of defence.     It .also appears that his Staff at beyrout propose to press the Turks for Staff conversations when the Turks are, infact, most unwilling to have them.3.        Generally speaking, General Weygand shows himself in favour of a more forward policy in the Balkans regardless ofthe possibility that this might bring Italy and Russia intothe war.     He is still strongly pressing his proposal forthe formation of an &quot;eastern front&quot;.4.        The Foreign Office are of opinion that steps shouldbe taken to curb General Weygand&apos;s activities, and suggestthat this might be done, either through-the channel of theFrench Military Representatives in London or on a higherplane through the normal diplomatic channel.Agreed Policy in the Balkans.5.        From the military point of view we ourselves areno less apprehensive than the Foreign Office regarding these activities of General Weygand.     As will be seen from thequotations that follow, we have consistently advised infavour of keeping the war out of the Balkans as long as possible,and of doing nothing wbidi would arouse Italian suspicions,or jeopardise the maintenance of Italian neutrality.   We have recommended that, if the war did spread to the Near East, weshould restrict our commitments in the Balkans to the minimum.s  Annex     .

6.        In a Report on the subject of Balkan neutrality of the 9thSeptember- 1939 (W.P.(39)48), we were asked to consider &quot;whether at the present time and in the present circumstances it is preferable from the military point of view:-(a) To have the Balkan Entente neutral so long as Italy alsoremains neutral;   or(b) To have Turkey, Greece and Roumania &quot;belligerent on our side,even though this would inevitably involve the accession of Italy to Germaayo&quot;We reported&quot;We have no hesitation in saving that at the present time and inpresent circumstances (a) is preferable from a military pointof view.&quot;7.        The French Government at this time showed themselves equallyanxious to do nothing which would upset Italy.   The Supreme WarCouncil at their first meeting on 12th September, 1939, discussedAllied policy in the Balkans, and in particular General Weygand&apos;mission to the Hear East,   The following is an extract from the record of the Meeting:-&quot;The Council were informed that the purpose of General Weygand&apos;mission to the Near East was to study the dispositions thatwould be necessary on the Balkan front to meet the contingencyeither of Italian intervention or of a German advance throughthe Balkanss   Emphasis v/as laid on the necessity for ensuring that these precautions were kept in the background and werenot regarded by Italy as being directed against her.118.        Shortly after it was suggested by the Foreign Office that itmight be an opportune moment to furnish the Greet Staff with definiteindications of the- cc-operation that ./e should expect from Greece incertain circumstances and of the co-operation which the Greeks might expect from us;   and we were asked for our opinion on this proposal from the military point of view   In reply we stated that -&quot;the disadvantages of the possible repercussions of any conversa-tions with Greece at pres&apos;si.a*- ^ou?r- far outweigh any militaryadvantages we could possibly obtaino&quot;These conclusions were based on the danger of an unfavourable Italianreaction to any Staff conversations rath Greece- and on the considers-tion that we could not provide any British land or air forces toassist Greece unless the neutrality of Italy were assured beyond allpossible doubt. *9.        At the second meeting of the Supreme War Council on 22ndSeptember, 1939, the subject of Allied strategy in the Balkans was again discussed, and it was agreed:--&quot;That the possibility of establishing and maintaining an allied force either at Constantinople or at Salonika? with a view to preventing the domination of Balkans by Germany, should be examined by the Franco-British Staffs in London.&quot;The War Cabinet had, in fact, already agreed at their meeting on20th September, 1939:-&apos;(a) That the Chiefs of Staff Committee, taking aB their basistheir Appreciation of the Possible Future Course of the War(W.P. (39)33) ... should initiate the examination by theBritish and French Permanent Military Representatives on theSupreme War Council, of the croa - military strategy to beadopted in the Near East, including in particular the balkans.E. S 2    &quot;

10.      A Joint Report on this subject by the Anglo-FrenchPermanent Military Representatives (W.P.(S9) 70) was approved by the War Cabinet at their Meeting on 6th October,1939 (W.M.(39) 39th Conclusions, Minute 7).     On thehypothesis of Italian neutrality, the agreed reconmendatlonssubmitted by the joint Staffs were that:-(a) In the event of no German attack inSouth East Europe:-&quot;(i) Our policy should be to maintainthe neutrality of Italy and to consolidate the Balkan Statesinto a benevolently neutralbloc.(ii) We should endeavour to build up our potential militaryresistance to Germany by concentrating our available resources on supporting turkey and by forming an amply equippedstrategic reserve in Egypt and syria as forces become available.&quot;(b) In the event of a German attack in SouthEast Europe:-&quot;(i) We should concentrate on backingTurkey with war material.(ii) We should endeavour by diplomatic action and economic measures,backed up if possible by tokensupplies of arms to Greece and yugoslavia, to maintain a Balkanbloc, which might be turned togood account if Germany^ alreadyprecarious line of communicationwere extended towards the Aegean.&quot;As regards Salonika, it was recommended that:-&quot;No military commitment should be undertaken at Salonika except at the invitation of greece and with the prior agreement of Italy.The role of any force sent to Salonika mustbe limited to stiffening Greek resistanceand must be purely defensive.&quot;Danger of General Vfeygand&apos;s activities.11.       It will be clear from the above quotations that both the British and French Governments and their military advisers are fully agreed as to the desirability of acautious policy in the Balkans with a view to maintainingItalian neutrality.     It is equally clear, however, fromthe reports which have been received that General Weygandha8 very different ideas.

/12.      V/e desire to emphasise that from the military point ofview we are at present in no position to undertake anyadventures in the Balkans.     The over-riding consideration ofItaly&apos;s neutrality has not yet been achieved,   The administratively--ive facilities required for the operation of large forces inthis theatre are at present totally lacking, and would requiredevelopment on a large scale, while the strain which themaintenance of these forces would impose oh our resources ofshipping would be very heavy.     Any coraoitment once startedwould inevitably grow; and in this connection it must beremembered that any diversion of force to the Mi-Adle East mustresult in a corresponding dicinutian. of our military effort in france.     This is a point which no doubt the French Governmentwould be quick to appreciate,,Forthcoming Anglo-French Conversations on Hear East Strategy.13.       The War Cabinet are a wire that the French are nowpressing for an early resumption of conversations between thetwo Staffs on Allied co-operation in South East Europe.    Theyhave suggested that thia discussion should be held in Parisrather than through the normal channel in the Anglo-FrenchPermanent iiilitary Kepreseiitafcives in Londor.o   The War cabinet agreed at their meeting or. 26th November, 1939 (W.M.(39) 95thConclusions, Minute 5) thar. the torn? of the reply to the french should include:-nX st 3  &amp; X(ii)   A preference for dealing with this matterthrough the machinery of the permanent military Representatives in London.-(iii)   A willingness to meet General Gamelin&apos;sconvenience by holding a meeting inParis of officers of suitable rank ifhe desired to take part in the discussions.&quot;14.      General Weygand is shortly due back in Paris and maybe drawn into discussions on future inter-Allied policy inSouth East Europe.   It is important, therefore, that his viewsshould be brought into line at an early stage with the policyalready accepted by the two Governments.   In view of hisposition in France we are of the opinion that this can best be done through the diplomatic channel. Conversations betweenthe two staffs can theri be resumed in accordance with theprocedure proposed by the War Cabinet (Paragraph 13).15.        To sum up -(a)   V/e have consistently taken the line that it is to our advantage from themilitary point of view to keep thewar out of the Balkans   as long aspossible and to do nothing which would arouse Italian suspicions and therebyjeopardise the maintenance of Italianneutrality.

(b) We agree with the view held by theForeign Off ice that General Weygand&apos;aactivities and intentions as regardsthe Balkans and Middle East rundangerously counter to the above policy.(c) We understand that General Weygand hasnot got the French Government behindhim, and we consider that steps shouldbe taken to curb his activities.(c)   We recommend   that action in accordancewith (c) above should be taken with theFrench through diplomatic channels.C.L.N.

annex copy of a Letter dated 25th November. 1939,from the Foreign Office&quot;to the Secretary.OfficeB of the War Cabinet.  .X   XXX   XWe have been rather disquieted by the part played by General Weygand in the recent discussions between him andthe Turkish Marshal and General Wavell at Angora as recorded in the minutes recently received.     It is particularlyGeneral Weygand1s attitude as regards Salonika which makesus uneasy.     In his note on the conversations, of which acopy was sent to Nichols by Mallaby, General Wavell says that General Weygand was as anxious as ever about Salonikaand gave the impression that his Government had put thebrake on him.     In the course of the conversations, general weygand reco, amended secret consultations with the Greeks and asked whether it would not be possible to obtain permissionfrom the Greek General Staff to allow French officers, suitablychosen from the point of view of discretion, to go to Greecein mufti to work out details with the Greek General Staff(page 9 of the record of the second day&apos;s conference).     Itwill be remembered that General Weygand made the same suggestion to a Greek Staff Officer at Angora in September (see Hugessen&apos;telegram No. 435 of the 12th September, copy enclosed).*2.        General Weygand also recoinaednded secret negotiationswith the Yugoslavs and the Roumanians regarding their linesof defence (page 10 and page 12 of the second day&apos;s record).Generally speaking he expressed himself as in favour of amore forward policy in the Balkans with less regard for thepossibility of bringing Italy and Russia into the war (page18).3.        No doubt General Weygand would justify the line he took during the conversations by saying that the object ofStaff conversations is to discuss the military measures tobe taken in all eventualities, and that the discussions ofthe eventualities does not mean that they are bound to arise.Nevertheless Ms remarks on the subject of Salonika seementirely to ignore our view that Greece should remain neutralas long as possible, except in the&apos;special case of Italyand Bulgaria both entering the war on our side.     Moreoverhis recommendations about Staff talks with the Yugoslavsand the Roumanians vrauld certainly be most unwelcome to boththe latter;   and his general attitude as regards policy inthe Balkans is at variance with our present desire to encourage the formation of a neutral bloc, and to keep the war out ofthe Balkans.4.        In one of his resent telegrams Hugessen says tliathe gathers that General Weygand&apos;s staff at Beirut are showingsigns of undue activity as regards pressing the Turks forx Enclosure.

Staff conversations when the Turks ore in fact mostunwilling to have them (i have written to you separatelyon the subject of staff conversations), ana that thisis said to be embarrassing his French colleague.5.        In addition to all this, Nichols has had a letterfrom Rendel at Sofia recording a conversation with theFrench Minister there in which the latter told Rendelthat General Weygand was still strongly pressing his proposal for the formation of an &quot;Eastern front&quot;.According to the French Minister General Weygand was infact actively collecting an army which he would expect to be allowed to use, and it would be very difficult, theMinister feared, to get the idea of an &quot;Eastern front&quot;completely abandoned.     The Minister added that whatevermight or might not be likely to happen, the Bulgarianswere well aware of General Weygand&apos;s scheme and were by no means confident that it would not at some stage be proceeded with.     He therefore felt that the rjumpinessthat the Bulgarians had lately been showing was at anyrate explicable.6. It seems altogether undesirable that general weygand should be left free to take this rather forwardline of his own as regards policy in the Balkans and we feel that scmethiug ought to be done to see that he iscurbed. -. It occurs to us that this might be done either(a) by putting in a word with the French military representatives here, or (b) by talcing the matter up through our Embassy in Paris, as we did last September.     Method(b) would probably involve the more severe snub to general weygand than method (a) and conceivably might not thereforebe to our (i.e. British military) ultimate advantage.But if you agree that something should be done we would leave the choice of methods to you.X    X    X    X   X    X(Signed)   o*G.

ENCLOSURE TO ANNEX.Copy of cypher telegram elated 12th September, 1939from II. Li. Ambassador, Turkey to the ForeignOffice./So. 435^GECKuT.Uy telegram iJos -423.Following io military Attached report of interview withGeneral Vteygand on 12th September.2. General Weygand first explained his position and taskin Syria and that he had already made contact with british military, air and naval authorities in Egypt.   He had come toAngora to make contact with Turkish General Staff and to meet aGreek officer of operations bureau who had been sent by GreekChief of the Staff to give him information regarding Greek&apos;dispositions and plans.   He had&apos;found Turkish General Staffabsolutely loyal to Franco-3ritish agreement but very bitterabout quantity and slowness of delivery of material.   TurkishGeneral Staff had not yet made preliminary approaches to GreekGeneral Staff envisaged in paragraph 4 of draft MilitaryConvention nor would they do so until Convention had been signed.3.        From information from Greek officer he consideredGreeks better prepared than he had expected though lamentablyweak in aviation.4.        Greek officer on his return to Athens was to askGreek Chief of Staff whether General Weygand could send staff officers in plain slothes to study the situation at Salonika onthe ground.5.        He then explained his theory that stronger allied action was needed in the Balkans, that Greeks must be reinforced,and that if this brought Italy into the war, it was merelyprecipitating what in his opinion was a foregone conclusion.He knew that this view was different from that of His -.Majesty*s Ambassador.   He had therefore reported his views&apos;,home in order to try and force the two home Governments toagree to a policy.   He explained that he had at present twostrong brigades in Syria available for shipment overseas andthat he was shortly to receive a division from Morocco, thusforming an army corps. - He was returning to Beirut on 13thSeptember but was leaving railway staff officer to continuestudy of problem of movement of French troops from Syria toSmyrna or Pandirma which were the only two portB the Turkscould allot.   TMp ^^officer would keep Military Attacheinformed as studies proceeded.Please inform War Office.Addressed to Foreign Office No. 435 of 12th September!repeated to Athens.
