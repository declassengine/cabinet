Copy- No. 19mm (39) 131.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK /AND KEY.It is requested that special care n\iy be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.I trust.my colleagues will take these matters into consideration.W. S. C.November 21, 1939.INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION IN EIRE.Memorandum by the Naval Staff.-Present inability of obtain sufficient information from Eire.JBK. IN-no civilised part of the world is Great Britain less able to obtain vital unique;lnformation than in Eire.- This situation arises out of the political anomaly that intelligenceJjEife, whife nominally endowed with the status of a Dominion, will not accept organisation-that status.   If Eire fulfilled the obligations of Dominion status, she would in regard:Jo-operate.with the Imperial Government in the supply of information vital to t0  Ire-ilbe security of the Empire.fio y If,: on the other hand, she were &quot;treated like a neutral foreign country, LimitedjGreat Britain would establish a S.I.S. organisation and have consular representa- Informationftlbh to protect her vital interests: - available.2. Without S.I.S. organisation, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government hasno organised means of detecting enemy activity in Eire, and is forced to rely on : ? . &apos;&apos; ip) . Such information as the Government of Eire itself may choose to supply;-&quot;-&apos;.- &quot;or&apos;(b) Information volunteered by members of the public, which is usually secondor third hand, is most difficult to verify and is almost invariably toopss i-      Mate;for any possible action.-Potentialities of Eire as a field of enemy activity.fj-i 3. Eire is at least a potential, probably an actual, field of enemy activity Eire afieldIn the following respects, namely:- actfvity/(a) As a country much affected by enemy penetration and a centre for enemyespionage (fostered by the presence of the German Consul and hisMl staff&apos;in Dublin).&apos; (6) As a centre of distribution of information helpful to the enmy.m: (c) As a base for U-boats.  (The word &quot;base &quot; is used loosely in this para-graph, as explained more fully below in paragraph 7.)[20344]
Three v :::problems todeal with.This Memo,deals only with questionof obtaining information.&apos;vif ,;4.   The following-problems therefore arise,.-namely: - (a) How to neutralise enemy espionage in Eire.    ---.(b) How to prevent leakage of information through Eire.(c) How to obtain information relating to maritime everts on the coasts- of Eire. . l&apos;rLi5 - Of these problems (a) and (6) are outside the scope of this memorandum the War-Cabinet has already considered (6) and action is being taken to giveeffect to its conclusions. The object of this Memorandum is to deal withproblem (c) and suggest the solution for this problem.Necessity for Obtaining more Information.ftatetf ^- Present unsatisfactory state of affairs can best be understood, byaffairs shown   consideration of the available evidence in regard to the question of U-boat;%by U-boatposition,activities in Eire territorial waters.U-boats in territorial waters.7. A detailed memorandum On this subject has already been submitted&quot;(N.I.D. Memo. No. 01513, dated the 11th October), summarising the available evidence down to that date on the question of U-boat activity. The conclusionsdrawn in that memorandum were that although there was then no evidence proving&apos;the existence of refuelling bases, there was evidence to show that U-boats were at least using Eire territorial waters for purposes of occasional rest, and quitepossibly were also landing crews for purposes of relaxation and obtaining freshprovisions.8. Since the 11th October, a trawler has reported a U-boat seen on the8th October, 2 miles West of Rathlin 0&apos;Byrne, and an aircraft has reported onewest of the Blaskets on the 16th October (apparently just outside territorial waters).&apos;A-:rep*ort has also been received of a U-bbat. seen from the shore, nearBundoran (Donegal Bay) on the 27th September, which may have been the sameas that seen in Donegal Bay on the 30th September1 (see N.I.D. MemorandumNo. 01513, paragraph 19 \e)). - .: There is also a considerable and increasing body of. information of U-boatcrews landing and obtaining provisions at places on the West and South coasts of eire. most.of which it is impossible to check by any of the existing methods ofobtaining information, and therefore can neither be accepted, nor wholly dis-counted. One such report, however (of a U-boat coming into Bantry Bay,and.taking in provisions on the evening of the 9th November), comes first-hand from.areliable source:9.

There is amplfe evidence that the coasfcwatchihg organisation in Eirecannot be relied on. by His Majesty&apos;s Government as1 a&apos; means of obtaining;information.12.

Lastly, the U-boat seen on the 27th September was reported to the localIPLvic Guard, and in this case, also, no report reached London.16.   The only satisfactory feature is that on the 4th November Mr. Walshe Report of-Of the Eire Government verbally reported to the Naval Attache in Dublin that-j^e?&quot;&quot;&quot;submarines had been sighted by Eire Coastal Aircraft on the 7th and 12th October aircraft,and the 2nd and 3rd November, and reported en clair by the sighting aircraft to Dublin.17. .
