ggCHCTII E II 0 R A N D TJ H0 NTHE   DEFE1TCE   OF   GREAT   BRTTAPI . AGAINST   INVASION1.   Scale of Attack.The maximum possible in any conceivablecircumstances is an attack by 4,000 men dropped byparachutes, followed by 15,000 men carried in civil aircraft, and one or more divisions, each in 20 transports,arriving, presumably, in series..It has been suggested that the method ofprocedure would be for the parachutists to be dropped onan aerodrome, which they would seize, and so permit of the landing of the civil aircraft.    The force so landed, ora   portion of it, would then proceed to seize a port forthe disembarkation of the divisions coming by sea, andHarwich and the Humber have been mentioned as the mostsuitable.&apos;!2.   Defence Measures now in operation.(a)   Civil defence, including anti-sabotage.     (SeeMaps I &amp; II). 7&quot;        &quot;There are, at the present moment, 34,000 soldiers,armed with rifles, guarding various vulnerable points,including aerodromes.    These aerodromes also have anumber of men belonging to A.D.G.B. or the B.A.F..respectively, .who are armed or being armed with Small Amweapons by the responsible authorities.In support of the above, bodies of troops aredistributed over the country, close to all importantcentres of population, as reserves in support of civil authorities/   -

authorities in case of bombs dropped from the air.    Thissame distribution will be equally effective if it is menwho are dropped from the air*There are also over 160,000 men in various stages of training in training centres all over the country.(b)   In support of (a) is the remainder of the field army, the units of which are concentrated for training purposes according to the state of their training, i.e.in the case of the 51st and 48th Divisions, which arefirst to go overseas, concentration is comparatively close,whilst in the case of the second line divisions there isa much greater degree of dispersion owing to the fact thatthey are still partly engaged in taslc (a) above.Between these two extremes other divisions arein various stages of concentration, but all have mobiledetachments ready to move at various degrees of warning.3.   Measures to meet dangers envisaged in paragraph 1.It i3 axiomatic that men landed from the air can bring little with them but rifles, light machine guns, anda very limited amount of aoounition, and would therefore have no staying power nor poi?er of irjanoeuvre, unless quicklysupported and maintained from the sea. -   Thedisembarkation, however, of a field force is a very slow andformidable undertaking, even if entirely unopposed, and therate at which it can be carried out depends largely on thenumber of ships which can be handled simultaneously, andconsequently on the number of quays, wharves and cranesavailable.    For instance It would take several days to landa Division at Harwich complete with transport.To /

To be successful, therefore, entails the Beizure ofa considerable port, and our defence measures are such thatthis could not be done froa the sea by a &quot;coup de main&quot;.If carried out by troops landed from the air, the latter would have to be dropped in an unenclosed area otherwise theycould not collect again, which means some delay in actuallygetting control of the port.     This would take time becausethe defence would have to be driven from all ground covering the docks, anchorage or entrance to the port before the transports could enter and commence to unload.Once landing from the air in any force hascommenced the point of attack has been disclosed and cannotagain be changed.     It would be supremely dangerous to attemptto conraence sea-borne operations until the success of theair landing operations was quite certain, so if the initialair landing operations are a failure, the operation cannotproceed further and has definitely failed.Arrangements to ensure this are as follows and are shown in broad lines on Hap III which gives thedistribution of the formations of the Field Army.     Attachedto this Map is a table showing the composition of theformations available for active operations and the number oftheir units which are immediately mobile.     In addition,there are of course large numbers of troops of A.D.G.B. and. in Training Centres which are too numerous to show.The plan of operations, generally speaking, is asfollows :-1st STAGETroops in the area attacked would inflict themaximum amount of casualties whilst the enemy were actuallylanding /

landing and collecting from their parachutes or transportmachines, in which, of course, the former.would be assisteuby the A.D.G.B. and by any R.A.F. personnel on the spot.2nd STAGEIf a landing in any force were actually effected,a cordon would be drawn round the area by the troops in thevicinity, using their first line transport, which is now in course of provision, the object being to immobilise theinvader until further troops could be brought up to finishhim off.     Quick action is largely a matter of warning,depending on early reports by Observer Corps units -of theR.A.F. and by A.D.G.B. units which completely cover the area in question, and by the Civil authorities, with whom themilitary authorities are in close touch.3rd STAGEIf a landing from the air had been effected in east A1TGLIA, LUTCOUJSHIRE or YORKSHIRE, units of the armoured and 1st Cavalry Divisions which are being movedcloser to the danger areas, would be at once despatched tobreak up the enemy formations whilst they were stillendeavouring to concentrate.There are also ample troops South of the THAMESto deal with any attempt in KENT.4th stage the larger formations   shown on the map underEastern, northern and Scottish Commands, would concentrateforward towards the threatened area, moving by road, with transport earmarked to be ready at six to eight hours&apos;notice or, in a few cases, to be requisitioned when theemergency arises.It /

It is not, in practice, possible to place troops at shorter notice than six hours without stopping alltraining and adding very greatly to boredon and monotony,which are the principal dangers against which we have to contend during this coming winter.     Furthermore, to placetroops at shorter notice than six hours would mean thepermanent hiring of transport, which would prove verycostly and interfere with civil transport facilities.It is not considered that the additionalsecurity to be obtained by maintaining troops andtransport permanently at such short notice wouldcompensate for the disadvantages, in view of the high degree of security which can be obtained without so doing.th STAGESHove General Headquarters reserves, viz., 51st48th and 55th Divisions, using road transport previouslyearmarked for the purpose.:&apos;&apos;-av.Mv: i :        ;;- :fr:-     &apos; . &quot;.
