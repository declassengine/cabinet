ENCLOSURE.,I.O.S. (39) 117 (J.P.J7       WAR   CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMIilTTEE.GERMAN INVASION OF HOLLAND.Report by the Joint Planning Sub-Committee.At their meeting on the 10th November, the Chiefsof Staff Instructed us:-(i)  To examine the French plan for the occupationof the Scheldt, on the alternative hypothesesof:-(a) A German invasion of Holland with a request by Belgium that we should cometo their (i.e. Belgium&apos;s) assistance.(b) A German invasion of Holland with norequest for help by Belgian.(ii)  To examine the general French plan for the advance into Belgium at the request of the belgians, and, on the understanding thatwe accept tlie plan, to see what we can do to help.2.       We have set out in the Annex a short precis of theFrench plan.3.       Since the above terms of reference were drafted,we have been informed of General Gaaelin*s intentions inthe circumstances in which, although Holland is invaded,the Belgians do not call for allied assistance.The French say that in these circumstances they arenot authorised to enter Belgium and could not do so. Sincethe occupation of the mouth of the Scheldt was only intendedas prolongation of the general moveaent towards the Scheldt-1-

by the French and British forces, if Belgium remainedneutral, and did not invite assistance, there would beno question of occupying either the islands Korth ofor the region South of the Scheldt.h.        In view of the above, we have assumed that an examination under the hypothesis in paragraph (i) (b)above will not now be required.     We have thereforeconfined our report to an examination of the French plan in accordance with paragraphs (i) (a) and (id) above.EXAMINATION OF THE FRENCH FLAN FOR OCCUPATIONOF THE MOUTH OF THE SCESLPT..(para. 1 (i ) (a)).5.        The-French consider the establishment ofcontrol in the Scheldt area of importance for the following reasons(a) The occupation by the Germans of the mouth of the Scheldt would constitute a navalthreat to Great Britain.(b) If the proposed military movement throughBelgium took place the occupation of the mouth of the Scheldt would provide coveron the left for the Belgian and french forces operating in the region of Antwerp.(c) Generally the islands in the mouth of the scheldt and the area there would providea valuable base for enemy operations ifthey fell into German hands.The threat to Britain.6.       The denial of the West Scheldt to the ggaaanacould be achieved by the occupation of the South bank and without occupying the islands.    Moreover,, unlessthe Allies can control the whole delta as far Northas the River Mass, the occupation of the l*est Scheldtalone, would not remove, the German naval threat whichcould be developed from thi^ area.-

7. Similarly from the air- point of view the threat of German air attack on Great Britain whichcould he developed from Dutch territory would not hematerially affected &quot;by the occupation of Ifalcherenand South Beveland.Military Aspects.8. At the present moment the left of the Belgiandefences round Antwerp rests on Berendrecht which ison the East bank of the Scheldt Estuary, five miles south of the Eastern toe of South Beveland.     Unlesstherefore the French intend to take up a defensiveposition on the mainland in Dutch territory, so as tocover tie--causeway-to-the island, German forces wouldbe able to turn the Belgian left flank, the weakestpart of their defences, even if the islands were in french hands.     Even were the Franco-British linemoved forward into Holland to cover the causewaythere would still be insufficient depth on this -flank.If it were possible to swing the Franco-Belgian left flank to approximately the line of the Eiver Hark,ana -join up with the Butch about Breda, this wouldgive far greater depth for the defence of Antwerp,and would appear to be a sounder military proposition.This would however entail the Belgians leaving theirprepared positions and it is extremely doubtfulwhether French forces could arrive on this line and consolidate it sufficiently before the Germans arrived.

St,        Two further military points not mentioned by theFrench are:-(i)   The occupation of the Islands of &quot;alcherenand South 3eveland would not prevent theGermans bringing artillery fire to bear onthe Vest Scheldt.    It would be necessaryto go further forward in order to achieve this.(ii)   The use of Antwerp as a port could be denied to the Belgians in any case by air attack,and, as soon as the Germans came up againstthe Antwerp defences, by long rangebombardment.Economic Aspect.10.      The economic consequences for Belgium of a german invasion of Holland, are briefly as follows: -(a) German control of the T7est Scheldt would giveher an economic stranglehold on.Belgian.(b) If, however, at the saiae tine the Germansover-ran the Eastern half of Belgium, theeconomic life of the country would virtuallybreak down,, and the control of the WestScheldt would then be uninportant.(c) The remnant of the Belgian population andindustry behind the Anglo-French-3elgianlines, could probably be&apos; supplied acrossthe French frontier and through the BelgianBerth Sea ports.-It will be seen, therefore, that there i7ill be no economic advantage to Belgium in the occupation ofwalcheren and South Beveland even if we could retain theuse of the port of Antwerp, butv as we have shown above,the occupation of the islands would not achieve this.Sfe therefore feel that the occupation of the islands would not in fact &quot;be effective cover for the left flank of the Belgian and French forces operating in the region of Antwerp.    Clearly the position of the troops on the island, in the absence of adequate A.A. defences and fighter support, would be precarious, and more so whenthe German advance reached the left of the Belgian defencesround Antwerp.

IBSConclusions on the Trench Plan to occupy the month of the scheldt.     ^ &quot;&quot; . ....   ^        .025; V/e do not consider that the occupation of thej 6lands of &apos; alcheren and South Develand could have any effect in reducing the scale of naval or air threat to this country, consequent upon the German occupationof Holland.    Nor would it appear that the presenceof French troops in these islands would he sufficienteither to provide adequate cover to the left -fia^frof the Belgian defence, or to afford us the use ofAntwerp.     Nor is It necessary to occupy the islandsto deny the use of the waterway to the Gardens.23m        On military grounds we suggest that the correctstrategy would he eitherj-(a) That the Belgian left flan^ should &quot;be moved forward so that the French canlink up with the Dutch about Breda, or(b) That the French should occupy Dutchterritory on the Couth &quot;bank of the Scheldtso as to deny the waterway to the germans and should make every effort to stlficnthe left Hank of the Belgian def-jnuor;.As it seem most unlikely that (a) could heachieved in time, the correct plan therefore is featset out in (h).BRITISH ASSISTjSJCS TIT THE EXECUTION OF TEL.&quot;   GENERAL FRSyQK PLAN.    (Para. .1 ill A.X5.       We now turn to consider what we can do to helpin the execution of the general plan on the understandingthat it is accepted.

3A      The British Ezpeoiticmary Force is raider theorders of the French andifcs action is under the direct control of the Consnander-ln-Chief.     la feel sure that the French High cosEiand is fully alive to the tinefactor and will not cossait the British ExpeditionaryForce to an encounter &quot;battle.Air Assistance.Bombers.15     The action of our bombers will be in accordancewith the existing plans for resisting the invasion ofBelgium.     when the invasion of Holland was previouslyconsidered the Chiefs of Staff concluded that -&quot; we might be able to retard the invasion toa very limited extent by air attack,but such action srould be expensive incasualiti es and would have no effect in thelong ran. &quot;We should therefore earploy our bombers Chiefly with theobject of assisting Franco-British forces to established themselves forward in Belgium.FipfaterB.28*     We have two squadrons of fighters now in Francewith the British Expeditionary Force, and two more squadronsunder orders to iiiove on 11th November.    There are inaddition two squadrons with the Adrranced Air striking force whose functions are to cover the Derations ofthat force.     Arrangements also exist whereby additionalHurricane Souafirons could be operated from East Kentover northern Belgium and Tfestern Holland, and aservicing base has &quot;been established at Eouen to. aecoEsaodate two Fighter Sqpadrons.

Both the latter arrangements are of course dejendantoa the air situation in the united Kingdom and the north sea &quot;being such as to justify the release of the squadrons from  their home stations.2 .    He would however draw special attention to two points -(a)   It is most important that the advanceof the Franco-British forces into belgium E-rurLd not be unduly erpoBedto attack by the German bomber force.To afford adequate cover to their advance is likely to absorb all theefforts of the French and British fightersavailable.(b)   A Gar;ear. Invasion of Holland might wellcoincide with a determined attach onthe ITnit^cL Kingdom, or on the BritishFl^et and convoysc     It might, therefore&quot;ba impossible to release more thanthe two squadrons now under orders to goto France.In general, for the above reasons and in view ofthe distances involved even adequate support for   a&apos;Franco-British advance in Belgium may be difficult andit would be quite impossible to guarantee the necessary-degree of air superior! ty over the Vtelcheren area.Assistance in the Occupation of the Islands.Assistance on Land.Iflp    On the assumption that the French insist on theoccupation of the islands we have considered whether we could afford them assistance with troops.29.    British troops would have to be transported by seafrom england and this would take a longer time thanthe French movement, even If the French troops embarkedat Bunkerque.    Eoreover the French have not in fact

masked na to send British troops in the first instance.SO.      It would not be a Bound proposition to transportsmall bodies of troops to Flushing by air, especially esthe only aircraft available for this purpose are unarmedcivil aeroplanes.    We could not therefore hope to fore-stall the German parachute troops. 1.      We have no A. A. defences which we could make available to protect French troops on the island.22.      We feel therefore that we can afford the Frenchno assistance with troops in thi s - operation.   Theultimate relief of the French by British troops, whichwas suggested by the French, would result in an isolatedBritish detachment between the Butch and French armies,which, would be undesirable.    Any additional british forces which may become available would be better-employed in s-trsngthening the British ExpeditionarySorce.23.      The best means of denying the islands to the germans would appear to be by arrangement with the Butch for their forces to be allotted to tsur task.Naval Assistance.24.      If the French decide to carry out that part of their plan which involves occupying Walcheren and South Beveland,British naval light forces could he disposed to givestrategic cover to French troops moved by sea fromTJunkerque ar Zeebrugge to Flushing.26.      It will be possible to allocate two A.A. cruisersto support the French expedition for a short period chileit is in actual process of moving to Flushing.    the cruisers could.not, however, remain in the Scheldt, and could only be provided at the expense of the protection ofour Bast Coast convoys, at a time which might be one ofspecial danger to the latter.-8-

I9uThe security of the water ccsamniicatioDS acrossthe West Scheldt between the mainland and the islands would he dependant on the efficiency of the existingcoast and local naval defences, of which we have verylittle knowledge.    The French nay be able to supplement the coast defences with mobile guns.(Signed? J.K.&quot;. ZETTiSUY.\&quot;      J.C. SLCSSQR.&quot;      E.C. CTCCFCa.-tral WaP Soon,[10th. Noveaber,1939.

ANireg IPS, ^GLOSUHE. jprecis o? raetics plan.general Conception.1.        Two primary objects;-(a) To aeny the Wii of the Scheldt toGermany, and(b) To stop the German advance as far forward in Belgium as possible, but not at therish of fighting an encounter battleat a disadvantage.2*       There are two lines in Belgium whioh General Gamelinconsiders suitable for holding up a German advance.   These ars-(a) Antwerp - Ttevre - Namur - and Southalong the River Heuse.(b) Antwerp - ilalines - Ghent - Audenarde -Tournai - Valenciennes.3.        If it can be consolidated in time the forwardline has many strategic advantages e.g., -(a) It gives greater depth for organising our air defences and at the same timebrings out air bases closer to Geisany.(b) It enables the main Belgian redoubt roundAntwerp to be included in the defensiveline without creating a salient.(c) It shortens the Allied line.Plan.h.        To make a methodical advance first to the line 2(b)and then, if circumstances permit, to the line 2(a).The occupation of the Dutch islands of ^aleherenand South Beveland, as a prolongation of the French left flank, is to be included in the first movement if it provespossible in the time available.
