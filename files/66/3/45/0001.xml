NAVAL SITUATION. *General Review.THE search for the German warships that sank H.M.S. Rawalpindi hasbeen the dominant feature of the naval operations in Home Waters. these operations have been hampered by bad weather, and up to the moment of goingto press have not been successful.2. Further German magnetic minelaying in the shallow waters of the east coast has taken place, but on a reduced scale compared with the previous week.Seven merchant ships (six British and one Polish) nave been sunk in this area.3. Nothing further has been heard of the raider reported in the Indian-Ocean. The re-disposition of British Forces in foreign waters referred to in lastweek&apos;s Resume has proceeded except for certain modifications made as the resultof the sinking of H.M.S. Rawalpindi.Home Waters.4. From interrogation of the ten survivors of H.M.S, Rawalpindi that werepicked up by H.M.S. Chitral and later information received, the following briefoutline of the action can be deduced : Rawalpindi was on a north-westerly course when, at 3-30 p.m. on the23rd November, the enemy was sighted to Jhe westward steering north. Chitralwas to the northward and the cruisers Newcastle and Delhi were to the southward,the nearest ship being more than thirty miles away. Visibility was good,and after about ten minutes Rawalpindi altered course 180 degrees to starboard,which brought the enemy on the starboard quarter. Smoke floats were dropped,but did not give any effective screening. The enemy first sighted closed rapidlvand signalled &quot; stop &quot; and &quot; what ship,&quot; and a few minutes later fired one round,which fell short. Soon after she opened fire and her second salvo hit somewhereon the boat deck and started a fire, the range then being about 44,000- yards.Rawalpindi replied to the fire, but two of her guns were soon put out of action;one gun, however, claimed to have scored three or four hits. The first enemysighted soon crossed astern and a second enemy ship was now sighted to starboard,and it was this ship which appears to have done most damage. Rawalpindigradually lost her speed as the range fell to 8,000 yards and the fire spread.5. Two boats were got away, the first with four men in it and the second withten men. A little later a water-logged boat drifted by and a Chief Petty Officercalled to some of the men on deck to swim to it, and it seems that about thirtymade the attempt, but only ten reached it and remained in it until Chitralpicked them up at 11 o&apos;clock next morning. Whilst these survivors were in thisboat, one of the enemy ships came up. but before they were picked up it seems thisship was recalled by the other enemy ship and she made off at high speed.6. It appears that the foremost magazine blew up at about 5 o&apos;clock, butRawalpindi did not sink till three or four hours later. Efforts to flood magazineswere made as the fire got more furious, but shell fire had destroyed the floodingarrangements. A young steward who had remained on board till the ship sankwas picked up by Chitral the following afternoon. He and three others hadbeen thrown near a capsized boat, to which they had clung, but the othersgradually became exhausted and fell off. The survivors&apos; descriptions of theenemy ships are conflicting, but from their evidence it seems possible that one ofthem may have been a battle cruiser.All witnesses state that there was no panic whatsoever in Rawaljnndi, anda Petty Officer said that everyone had appeared to do all that was possible.7. On receipt of the news of the sinking of H.M.S. Rawalpindi the home fleet took up positions in the North Sea calculated to intercept the Germanwarships, should they be attempting to return home. Strong searching forces were ordered towards Icelandic waters and the armed merchant cruisers were temporarily withdrawn from the Northern Patrol. ^Special submarine patrols were disposed in the North Sea and special air searches and patrols were alsoarranged to be flown. These operations have continued throughout the week underrenew.
&quot;... 8. A trawler which arrived in the Htjmber on the 29th November reportedhaving sighted at 5-45 p.m. on the 24th November a battle cruiser and a smallerwarship in a position fifty miles North of where the Rawalpindi was sank,from which it appears that the raiders remained in this vicinity for. twenty-four hours after the attack.9. &quot;Enemy air reconnaissance of the Shetland Islands took place on the24th and again on the 25th November, when an enemy plane was engaged anddriven off by H.M.S. Coventry. In the North Sea seven enemy aircraft attackedH.M.S. Aurora with bombs on the 25th November, and later the same dayfourteen bombs were dropped in an attack on H.M.S. Inglefield. No hits were obtained in either.of these attacks. On the morning of the 29th November,ELM. Ships Aurora, Ilex and Newcastle all reported being shadowed by enemy aircraft in the Dorthern part of the North Sea. Some of our aircraft were sent to attack but no engagements are reported.10.   On the 28th November H.M.S. Norfolk, while on passage to a patrol line^in the North SeaJ reported&quot; an explosion astern of her. She at first thought this&quot;\b be the result of bombs from aircraft, but it is now considered she wasunsuccessfully attacked by submarine, in view of the German broadcast claim that a British 8-inch cruiser was sunk by a U-boat that day in approximatelyihe position in which H.M.S. Norfolk was in at the time this incident occurred.11. The German S.S. Borkum, intercepted in the Denmark Strait byH.M.S. California on the 18th November, was shelled and set on fire by a german submarine on the 23rd November whilst on passage to Kirkwall with a prizecrew on board. She was abandoned and finally drifted ashore on AikernessSkerry (Orkney Islands). The prize crew and her own crew were rescued.The German S.S. Konsul Hendrik Fisser (4,458 tons) was captured byH.M.S. Calypso north of the Faroe Islands on the 23rd November and has beensent in to Leith with a prize crew.        .     ...12. H.M.S. Triad (submarine) broke down off the Norwegian coast on the afternoon of the 27th November. Two destroyers were sent to her assistance, butthe weather was too bad for her to be taken in tow at once. On the 28thH..M.S. Inglefield took her in tow, but the tow parted when twelve miles west ofFistan Light. On the 29th November a Hudson aircraft was sent to locate herand maintain a protective patrol to the southward, and later H.M.S. Inglefieldagain took her in tow. When about fifty miles west of the Norwegian Coast itwas decided to take her into territorial waters to effect repairs if possible, and shearrived in the Skudesnes Fjord on the 30th November.Baltic13. A German armed trawler of 400 tons is reported to have been mined and sunk off Langeland Island in the Great Belt on the 27th November. Thereare said to be only three survivors. A German patrol vessel was also mined inthis position on the 25th November and no report of the casualties has beenreceived. ; .French Naval Co-operation.14. In the special dispositions made as a result of the sinking ofEM.S. Rawalpindi the French Navy have taken an active part. A French battle cruiser, two cruisers and destroyers are carrying out a sweep with British forces to the west of the Hebrides.A battleship, two cruisers and four submarines are acting as escorts for north Atlantic convoys.French convoys and French naval escorts are in operation in theMediterranean and homeward to and from Gibraltar, and special patrols arealso in operation off the Spanish Coast. A submarine patrol is being maintained in the Canaries and an armed merchant cruiser patrol in the Azores area.French aircraft patrols have been greatly increased in the Channel and are co-operating closely with British forces in.this area.In the South Atlantic one battle cruiser and two French cruisers are co-operating&quot; with our forces and they have a number of long-range flying boatsoperating from Dakar.[20409] i2
In the Indian.Ocean, too, an 8-in. French cruiser and two escort vessels are working with British forces patrolling.German Magnetic Mines.15. During the week under review German aircraft have continued to laymines off the East Coast. Mines were dropped by aircraft in the thames estuary on the 24th November, and on the 25th November trawlers reported themoff the coast of Northumberland. There appear to be two types of minelayingaircraft. One type alights on the water to lay the mine, and in the other minesare dropped while in the air with a parachute attached. It is believed eachmachine can carry two mines. Two magnetic mines were recovered on the23rd November, and these have been fully examined. They are designed to lie onthe bottom and are fired by the magneticfield of the ship passing over them.16.   The following counter-measures have been taken: (a) On the 28th November an air raid was carried out by our long rangefighters on Borkum, which is the base for the minelaying aircraft.Further details of this attack are given in the Air Section of this sum6.(b) A balloon barrage of thirty balloons is being installed to the eastward ofSouthend Pier, and from the end of the barrage to the EdinburghChannel. A.A. guns and mobile searchlights on self-propelled bargesare being provided. A gun area has been arranged in the EdinburghChannel, to be served at night by three anti-aircraft cruisers and twopaddle minesweepers mounting Bofors guns. Further extinctions of navigation lights in the Thames Estuary are being made.(c) A special magnetic sweep has been prepared,Jb^ased^on data obtained fromthe mines recovered. (A. magnetic mineswas successfully exploded by -v^Jl        this sweepjin the Firth of Forth area^ a-*^c o-n*- oj Anti-Snbmarine Operations.17. During the week under review there have been twelve attacks onsubmarines by destroyers and anti-submarine trawlers. On the 25th November,after S.S. Royston Grange had been torpedoed and sunk whilst in convoy, twoof the convoy escort, H.M.S. Versatile and Witherington, made contact with thesubmarine and carried out what appears to have been a successful attack. late in the evening of the 25th November the French destroyer Indomptable attacked a submarine 100 miles west of Cape Finisterre. (This was probably thesubmarine which sank the S.S. Uskmouth.) The attack was believed unsuccessful,since another French destroyer carried out an attack in the same position early next day, also without apparent success.18. On the afternoon of the 29th November, H.M.S. Icarus, escorting theNorwegian convoy, attacked a submarine without success owing to breakdown in her anti-submarine gear. H.M.S. Kingston and H.M.S. KashmXtir were sent tocontinue the attack, and as a result of the former&apos;s attack the L&quot;-boat was sunk;the whole crew, four officers and thirty-nine men, were saved.19. The remaining attacks in which there were no definite indications ofsuccess were carried out: two in the Clyde, three off the East Coast, one in the bristol Channel and two in the Western Approaches. In connection with the attacks in the Clyde diving operations are being carried out.Distribution of the German Main Fleet.20. There has been little information regarding German Forces this week.An unconfirmed report stated that the cruiser Hipper completed refit and was due to meet Scharnhorst and Admiral Graf Spee at Heligoland on the25th November, and that the Gneisenau and Nurnberg were in the Schillig Roadson the same date. But on the 25th November air reconnaissance was carried out over the Heligoland Bight without any heavy ships being seen in the SchilligRoads, at Wilhelmshaven or at Heligoland . In addition to the two German
ships which sank H.M.S. Rawalpindi south-east of Iceland, there is probably a German Pocket Battleship in the Indian Ocean, as reported in last week&apos;sRcsunm.German Attack on Sea-Borne Trade.U-boat A attack.21. Two British and two neutral ships have been sunk by submarines duringthe period under review. With one exception, none of these were in convoy.The details are as follows : S.S. Royston Grange (5,144 tons), with a cargo of cereals and meat fromthe Argentine, was torpedoed and sunk while in convoy 150 miles to the westward of Lands End. All the crew were saved. She was not defensivelyarmed.S.S. Uskmouth (2,483 tons), with a cargo of coal from Sotjthend to &apos;Monaco, was found capsized 100 miles west of Cape Finisterre, having been sunk by shell fire by a U-Boat.  She was not defensively armed or in convoy.Three members of the crew were killed; the remainder were saved.Dutch S.S. Sliedrecht (5,133 tons), oil tanker bound from Abadan toTrondheim, was torpedoed and sunk 150 miles west of Ireland. the captain and five of the crew, who had been ordered on board the submarine and were subsequently picked up by the British trawler Menisia, state thatthe ship was torpedoed without warning as soon as they had arrived in theU-Boat. Twenty-seven of the crew are missing.Swedish Gustax E. Renter (6,000 tons), tanker, was.reported torpedoedfourteen miles west of Fair Island and broke in two. The fore part sank,but the after part was taken in tow and remained afloat for two days, buteventually had to be sunk by gunfire, as salvage operations proved too difficultunder existing circumstances. Thirty-three of the crew have been rescued.A later report suggests that the ship was not torpedoed, but blew up due toan internal explosion.22. In addition to the above, British S.S. Loch Lomond (5,452 tons) was attacked off Lundy Island. Loch Lomond, which had left a homeward-bound convoy shortly before, engaged the submarine with her defensive armament andescaped.  (The submarine was subsequently attacked by H.M.S. Walpole.)23. The trawler William Humphries is now presumed to have sunk offMalin Head, North Ireland, during the attack by a U-Boat on the 20th and21st November, reported in last week&apos;s Resume. It is feared there are nosurvivors.24. The unknown French ship, reported in last week&apos;s Resume as beingsunk on the 22nd November in the Western Approaches, proved to be the A rijon(4,374 tons).Mining.25. Six British, one Polish and one Dutch ship have been mined. Of these,five were in the Approaches to the Thames, two off the Humber and one of!Great Yarmouth.  The details of these ships are as follows: S.S. Hookwood (1,537 tons), with cargo of coal, mined and sunk while in convoy in approaches to Thames. Two of crew missing, fifteen survivors,of whom eight were wounded.M.V. Sussex (11,063 tons), general cargo, struck a mine off Sheerness,but was able to return to Gravesend under her own power. It is understoodthat this ship had disobeyed the instructions she had received.S.S. Rubislaw (1,041 tons), in ballast, mined and sunk in approaches toThames.  Four survivors, thirteen missing.S.S. Ionian (3,100 tons), cargo fruit, nuts, beans, &amp;c., mined and sunkwhile in convoy north-east of Great Yarmouth. The crew were all saved.(It is possible that this ship was torpedoed by a submarine.)S.S. Mangalore (8,886 tons), cargo manganese ore and pig iron, mined and sunk in entrance to River Humber. Pilot and 76 members of crewlanded at Grimsby.
GSS. Sheaf Crest (2,730 tons), in ballast, mined and sank while in convoyin approaches to Thames. Captain missing, one killed, fifteen woundedtaken off by minesweeper, some picked up by Polish destroyer.Polish S.S. Pilsudski (14594 tons), no passengers or cargo, mined ortorpedoed 17 miles off River Htjmber entrance, and sunk, if aster and oneboy killed: 79 survivors rescued by H.M.S. Valorous. This ship had just been converted into a transport.Dutch S.S. Spaarndam (8,857 tons), cargo, coffee and lubricating oil,from Tampico to Rotterdam. Mined off the approaches to the Thames.Five of the crew were killed by the explosion, and the ship was abandoned.She did not sink, and some twelve hours later was reported to be drifting tothe northwards and on fire: she was still on fire in a position twenty miles south-east of Harwich at 11-20 a.m. on the 29th.26. Italian S.S. Fianona, reported in last week&apos;s Resume mined off Deax,has arrived at Calais to be docked for repairs. . &apos;     .Surface raiders.27. The Press Report referred to in last week&apos;s Resume to the effect thatS.S. Clan Ogilvy had been sunk off the Mozambique Coast proves to be withoutfoundation, the ship having arrived safely at Mauritius, via Tamatave inMadagascar on the 27th November.Summary of losses by enemy action.28. The total losses by enemy action up to the present time amount tothe following :-* - , GrossBritish   &apos;         -     -                       Ships.

The average weekly increment of British ships and tonnage over twelveweeks was approximately five ships and 25,000 gross tons. Compared with this the average weekly loss of. British ships and tonnage for the same period was approximately 6-6 ships and 24,000 gross-tons.32. Vessels under construction now are 10 tankers of 66,OCfO tons and 128other vessels of 718,000 gross tons.33. Charts showing the combined British, Allied and neutral shipping losses from the commencement of hostilities and the British weekly shipping losses are attached.Protection of Sea-Borne Trade.34. Between the 22nd and 29th November twelve convoys comprising452 British, 33 Allied and 6 Neutral ships have been sailed, bringing the totalnumber of ships concerned up to the 29th November to 3,802. Three ships havebeen lost while in convoy this week making a total of five since the beginningof the war, which gives a percentage of losses of ships in convoy of one-seventhof 1 per cent. The average escort forces employed daily amount.to one cruiser,three armed merchant cruisers, six escort vessels and sixteen destroyers; inaddition, three French destroyers daily escorting between Gibraltar and theWestern Approaches.Economic Warfare.British Contraband Control.-35. On the 28th November there were 86 ships in the three BritishContraband Control ports.  (Kirkwall 42, Ramsgate 26, Weymouth 18.)In the Mediterranean 51 ships were held (Gibraltar 24, Malta 10, Haifa 13,Port Said 4). Out of 134 ships examined, 24 have been seized in prize, and the cargo seized in prize this week is 21,550 tons, including 11,700 tons of petroleum products.The control of German exports will come into effect on the 4th December in home Waters and on the 11th December in the Mediterranean; for a time it will only be partial in its application, as ships which have sailed before these dateswill not be affected. Ships having a &quot; Navicert,&quot; or which carry no goods from enemy territory, will be allowed to proceed. Certain goods and mails willbe exempt from seizure. It is probable that one or two new&quot;control stations willbe opened. . .- .    --  - .German Contraband Control.36. On the 28th November the Germans seized the Danish S.S. Cyril(2,116 tons) with a cargo of British coal, while she was waiting outsideStockholm.   During the week eleven neutral ships of a total tonnage of
21,836 tons have been reported as having been taken into German control stations.The Swedish press states that thirty-eight Swedish ships mostly with cargoes of cellulose for the United States were under detention in German controlstations on the 27th November.Casualties to Personnel of the Royal Navy.37. The Captain of H.M.S. Gipsy, who was seriously wounded last weekwhen this destroyer was mined off Harwich, has since died.The casualties in H.M.S. Rawalpindi were 39 officers and 225 ratings, ofwhom 26 are believed prisoners of war.H.M.S. Imogen had one rating killed due to enemy action.H.M.S. A rgus had one officer killedAccidents due to war service : three killed.The total naval casualties to date are: Officers. Ratings.Killed.       Wounded. Killed. Wounded.101 15 1,715 177MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.Allied Forces.38. The British Expeditionary Force is to extend its left to take over thefront hitherto held by the French 51st Division, which is being withdrawn from lord Gort&apos;s command on the 1st and the 2nd December.Operations.39. Except for a minor raid on a French post to the south of Waldwisse(east of Apach in the Moselle Valley) on the morning of the 27th November, theGermans have confined their operations to patrolling, artillery fire and the consolidation of their defences. Extremely bad weather has, no doubt, been onecause of this inactivity.Iroop Movement.40. The main flow of movement appears to have been by sea from east to west. Between the 18th and the 20th November the Kiel Canal was closed to commercial traffic to allow for the passage of troop ships, and the movementappears to have continued through Hanover and Essen in a south-westerlydirection. There have also been reports of the transfer of troops eastwardsfrom Aachen. These may indicate the relief of troops on the Dutch and Belgianfrontiers by newly-arrived units from Eastern Germany.Movement of War Material.41. There have been a few reports of the movement of war material towardsthe Dutch frontier, but it is not believed that this has reached any considerableproportions. On the other hand; it appears that considerable quantities of warmaterial, including ammunition, have recently been sent by rail to the Prum-Pronsfeld area, opposite the Luxemburg frontier.Bridging.42.  Bridging activity on the rhine has been in three main areas.(a) North of Wesel. In this area five bridges had been located up to themiddle of November, but there have been no reports since then toshow any further activity. In fact, recent air reconnaissancesreported no bridges between Emmerich and Bees. On the otherhand a report of approximately the same date stated that the pontoonsof the bridges between these places had been moored to the river bankThese reports are somewhat contradictory, and it may be that thepontoons have been moored to the banks and were not seen from
the air, or that the bridges have been dismantled and the pontoonsmoved elsewhere, or that they have been carried away in the recentheavy floods. I(b) Between Cologne and Coblenz. Five bridges had been located by themiddle of October, but little activity has been observed since then.A recent report stated that a pontoon bridge had been located atAndernach and that another bridge was being built south of Bonn,but details have not yet been obtained. The construction of a bridgesouth of Cologne, to carry the new Cologne-Aachen road, has alsobeen reported. .(c) Between Mainz and Mannheim. During October there was much activity in this area and at least seven bridges were located. Since thenbridge building appears to have diminished, if it has not ceasedaltogether.43. Early in October the Germans threw ten bridges across the Saar on a14-mile front north and south of Merzig. Since then their bridging activity in this area also has diminished considerably.German Army.&apos;4A. Owing to the limitations imposed upon Germany by the VersaillesTreaty, certain annual classes did not receive the normal two-year conscripttraining. After the re-introduction of conscription men of these classes, thoughby no means all of them, were called up individually from time to time and given a&quot; period of about three months&apos; training with supplementary (Erganzungs)units. These &quot; E &quot; Reservists, as they are called, are believed to be now serving in active or reserve units.Men of the 1911-12 classes, who have so far avoided this short-term training for various reasons, appear to have been called up in the Berlin area betweenthe 10th and 15th November. The calling up of these classes may, indeed, havebeen general throughout Germany, but there is no definite information to that effect. These men are reported to be wearing the numerals of active units ontheir uniforms. Presumably, therefore, they are to be used as reinforcements for active units when they have completed training.Reorganisation of the Hungarian Army.45. Several million peng&apos;6es* have been voted for the construction of newbarracks and the modernization of existing accommodation in order to cope withthe changes in organization scheduled for 1940. Under the new programme the brigade organization is likely to be abolished in favour of the divisional.Reported increases in establishment include armoured fighting vehicle, cavalryand mountain artillery formations.Soviet Rnssia and Finland.46. Interest has centred on the Soviet-Finnish dispute, which flared upafresh as the result of an alleged incident on the 26th November, when sevenFinnish shells were said to have fallen among a party of Soviet troops; a chargewhich the Finnish authorities deny as they say that no Finnish artillery was within twenty kilometres of the frontier. The Soviet Government allege that the incident took place at 3-45 p.m. on Sunday, but they had their official protestready to hand to the Finnish ambassador by 8-30 p.m. on the same night, and itseems highly probable that the incident had been foreseen. The subsequentbreaking-off of diplomatic relations shows that the Soviet is determined to force the pace and at least to subject Finland to the maximum degree ofintimidation which she can exert.On the military side, the Soviet demand that Finnish forces should withdrawtwenty kilometres from the frontier appears to be an effort to renew, ina different form, the political demand for Finnish territory on the KarelianIsthmus. The area the Finnish troops are now asked to evacuate is not as great as that claimed by the Soviet during the recent negotiations, nor is it of great* Par value 27-82 pengdes to the  .[20409] ....... c
military importance as it does not include any of the main Finnish fortifications.The Soviet is said to have concentrated 350,000 men, 750 tanks and 1,500 aircraftagainst Finland. This suggests a force of from twelve to fifteen divisions andone or two armoured brigades, and would probably be adequate for the openingphase of a campaign. Reports that Soviet troops have crossed the frontiermay, therefore, be more than minor incidents.Finland is also reported to have some 350,000 men under arms. These,however, have to guard the whole length of the eastern frontier as well as vitalcentres such as the Aaland Islands. It is unlikely, therefore, that there are morethan three weak divisions in the Karelian Isthmus. This force, helped by thenatural advantages of the ground, might temporarily withstand the Sovietformations likely to be deployed against it in trie initial stages of an attack.The season of the year is in trie defenders favour. A combination of hard frostand small depth of snow which might occur at this period would, it is true, makethe marshy ground more suitable for mechanical transport than at any otherseason, but the lakes are the positions great strength, and these should, by now,be partially frozen and thus obstacles to an advance either by boat or mechanical transport. Should the Soviet decide to press an attack in strength Finland mustbe over-run, but she would never be pacified and the task of seizing and holdingany considerable portion of Finnish territory would probably prove a test of theefficiency and morale of the Red Army to which the Soviet Government mayhesitate to subject it.The Finns appear to be ready to make minor concessions which, whilesufficient to satisfy the requirements of Soviet prestige, would not prejudice thedefence of their country. They have, as a final concession, offered to withdraw their troops as far as is reasonably necessary to remove the reputed threat toLeningrad, and it is believed that they would not oppose seizure of the smallFinnish islands in the Gulf of Finland.Lithuania.47. The Lithuanian Army formally entered Vilna on the 28th October.The city, whose normal population of 220,000 had been swollen by thirty toforty thousand refugees, had been in Russian occupation for some weeks. Russianroubles and Polish zloty were discredited, exchange rates wildly fluctuating,prices rising and bread running short. The Lithuanian Government supplied10,000 kilograms of bread and 30,000 kilograms of flour daily to the Vilnabakeries, but the bakers refused to sell to refugees for zloty which were worthless.On the 31st October demonstrations of Polish youth and Jewish Communistsled to a pogrom, and order was restored by the police only with the aid of the lithuanian Tank Corps. The Government then fixed the zloty-lit exchange, for limited quantities of currency, in order to allow the refugees to buy food; andthey anticipate a loss of eighteen million lits on the deal. Ration cards were alsointroduced, but with little success since the local Jews immediately used them as a speculative counter.The Government have now started a process of &quot; Lithuanization&quot; byreplacing Polish officials by Lithuanians. A deputation representing fifteenthousand of the former waited on His Majesty&apos;s Representative to ask him to intervene on their behalf with the authorities.Italy.48. The garrison on the French frontier appears to consist almost entirely of Alpini units. Seven infantry divisions are, however, concentrated west of theline Milan-Genoa, in addition to the formations normally stationed in that area; and two mobile divisions, over and above the peace garrison, are believed to be near the Yugoslav frontier.The fortifying of the Brenner continues to be reported. One report, which isthought to be reliable, says that the headquarters of the Army of the Po (a group of seven mobile, motorised and armoured divisions) is studying the problem ofdefence against a German advance over the Brenner Pass or through Yugoslavia.There have been several indications that military activity is now directed towardspreparing the army for war some time between the 1st March and the 1st April,1940. Reports do not indicate preparations against any particular enemy. the melting of the snow will, of course, uncover italy&apos;s frontiers in the spring.
Egypt-49. Personnel of the 9th Anti-Aircraft Regiment arrived at Alexandria onthe 28th November. The regimental transport is still en route. As soon as itstraining is complete, the regiment will take over the anti-aircraft guns at alexandria, which are at present manned by Royal Marines and personnel from gibraltar. The Gibraltar personnel will go to Haifa on relief to man the four3-7-inch anti-aircraft guns which have just been sent out.Far East,Military Operations.50. Japanese forces reached Nanning, in south-west Kwangsi, on the24th November, ten days after landing in the Pakhoi and Lungmtjn areas near the extreme southern corner of China. By the 26th November mopping-up opera-tions had been completed, and Japanese detachments were being moved towardsPinyang and Wuming, important road junctions twenty-eight and forty-eightmiles respectively to the north-east of Nanning.The Japanese forces so far employed for these operations have not exceededtwo weak divisions. They were opposed by approximately an equal number ofKwangsi provincial troops and guerrillas. Meanwhile, 50,000 Chinese troops from Kweilix, the Kwangsi capital, are reported to be moving south-westtowards Nanning. Three hundred miles further east desultory fighting is takingplace north of Canton, and minor encounters have occurred 5 miles outside theLeased Territory at Hong Kong.The Japanese Army has succeeded in cutting road, but not railway,communications between China and French Indo-Ciiina, and has achieved aspectacular victory which can be used for propaganda purposes at home, wherethe people, after two and a half years of war, no longer regard the campaign inChina with enthusiasm. Further, it is probably hoped that the success will attract Chinese adherents to the secessionist Government which the japanese have for some time been planning to establish in occupied China. It is too early to judge reactions on Chinese morale, the most important factor in the situation,but from the few indications available the effect is so far not pronounced.Situation at Tientsin.51. The situation shows no improvement, although it is now reported that supplies of coal are to be allowed into the Concession.AIR SITUATION.German Air Force.Coastal Operations.52. Aircraft from German coastal units showed continued activity off theEast Coast and Thames Estuary during the first half of the week, but duringthe last few days activity in this area has decreased. On the nights of the23rd and 24th. several enemy aircraft were plotted over the Thames Estuary,Whitby and Sheerness; sound plots were also recorded as far inland as Oxford.On the morning of the 24th, aircraft were over the Shetlands. On the night of the 27th and morning of the 28th, unidentified aircraft were plotted offFelixstowe and approaching the Firth of Forth and on the 30th oft north foreland.A number of reconnaissance aircraft have been reported each day wellout to sea off the east coasts of England and Scotland. On the morning of the29th there was unusual reconnaissance activity in the area lying between the shetlands and the coast of Norway.A bombing attack was made on the cruiser Aurora and the destroyerInglefield on the 24th off the Norwegian coast.Mine-laying by Aircraft.53.

military importance as it does not include any of the main Finnish fortifications.The Soviet is said to have concentrated 350,000 men, 750 tanks and 1,500 aircraftagainst Finland.&apos; This suggests a force of from twelve to fifteen divisions andone or two armoured brigades, and would probably be adequate for the openingphase of a campaign. Reports that Soviet troops have crossed the frontiermay, therefore, be more than minor incidents.Finland is also reported to have some 350,000 men under arms. These,however, have to guard the whole length of the eastern frontier as well as vitalcentres such as the Aaland Islands. It is unlikely, therefore, that there are morethan three weak divisions in the Karelian Isthmus. This force, helped by thenatural advantages of the ground, might temporarily withstand the Sovietformations likely to be deployed against it in the initial stages of an attack.The season of the year is in the defenders favour. A combination of hard frostand small depth of snow which might occur at this period would, it is true, makethe marshy ground more suitable for mechanical transport than at any otherseason, but the lakes are the position&apos;s great strength, and these should, by now,be partially frozen and thus obstacles to an advance either by boat or mechanical transport.

On their return theaircraft of this unit have frequently passed over Holland.Operations over France.55. During the period 11th to the 28th November German flights havebeen directed towards three distinct areas: (a) The Channel coast from Dunkirk to Treport and from Dunkirk along the Franco-Belgian frontier. Between the 11th and the 23rd theenemy made nine day and two night reconnaissances of this coast line and four reconnaissances of the frontier. There has been no furtheractivity in this area since the 23rd. The above flights took place atthe time when German operations were anticipated against Holland.They were presumably undertaken to establish whether there were anysigns of reinforcements arriving at the French Channel ports; to discover the location and strength of the allied defences along theBelgian frontier, and to locate aerodromes and rail-heads in the areabehind the frontier.(b) Over the. area behind the Maginot line. This was normal reconnaissanceactivity undertaken with the object of reporting movements in rear of the battlefront and ascertaining rail-heads and supply points.(c) Over the interior of France. On several occasions enemy aircraftreached the outskirts of Paris, and on one day a series of long flightswere made by single aircraft and by small formations from the Franco-German frontier near Switzerland through south-eastern, central and southern France reaching the Atlantic Coast near Bayonne.These flights were almost certainly undertaken for propagandareasons. The German Air Attache in Madrid admitted to some ofhis colleagues that they were intended to show the public in spain and Italy that flights similar to those of Royal Air Force aircraft over Germany could be undertaken by German aircraft.56. The enemy have continued to drop propaganda leaflets. These were released over Mulhotjse and Dijon and on the 22nd November hundreds fell inParis. The theme of the leaflet was to the effect that Germany had no quarrelwith France.French Air Force.Operations on German Frontier.57. Reconnaissance flights were made by the French on the 20th, 21st, 22ndand 23rd November. Photographic missions were carried out and pampMetsdropped on a number of occasions. Generally speaking, little unusual activity has been observed behind the enemy&apos;s lines. Since the 25th November the weatherhas deteriorated and made operations difficult.During the earlier part of the week a very large number of flights were madeby French fighters on single patrols. It is reported that, on the 22nd November,three enemy fighters were shot down by French fighters, and one probably byA.A. fire. Another landed intact at Strasbourg. On the same day an enemybomber was shot down in the neighbourhood of Ostend.On the 23rd November three enemy bomber reconnaissance aircraft are reported to have been destroyed by the French and one enemy bomberreconnaissance aircraft by French and British fighters.58. The French Government have notified the Belgian Government thattheir aircraft will pursue any German aircraft which attempts to escape by flyingover Belgian territory.
asRoyal Air Force Operations. s   &quot;;Reconnaissance of German Naval Bases.    &apos;    &apos;    &apos; &apos;159. Six Whitley aircraft carried out a reconnaissance of Wilhelmbhavek,Cuxhaven, Heligoland and Brunsbuttel on the night of the 24th-25thNovember. Leaflets were dropped in the course of this operation. there connaissance was repeated on the following day by four Blenheim aircraft.The position of certain warships was reported, but no enemy capital ships were observed. All Our aircraft returned.A similar reconnaissance by six Whitleys took place on the night of the27th-28th. The flight encountered severe weather conditions, which madeobservation difficult. One aircraft, which descended to 2,000 feet for closerobservation, met heavy anti-aircraft fire and was attacked by fighters. Theaircraft was badly damaged, but was able to regain its base.Sweep for Enemy Surface Vessels.60. Six Wellington bombers conducted a sweep of the North Sea in thedirection of Sylt on the afternoon of the 25th, and returned to their basewithout incident.As a result of the appearance of enemy warships in Icelandic waters on the23rd a number of bomber squadrons stood ready for immediate operations on receipt of reconnaissance reports.Fighter Operations.61. Long-range fighter patrols have been arranged with the object of destroying enemy mine-dropping aircraft. Formations of six and eight aircraftengaged on this task swept the area lying between the British and enemy coastson the 25th and 26th November without sighting any hostile aircraft.With the same intention, twelve Blenheims of Nos- 25 and 601 fighter squadrons carried out a low-flying attack on the seaplane base at Borktjm atdusk on the 28th November. Three seaplanes found on the slipways were attacked with machine guns, and attacks were made on the enemy pom-pom and machine-gun defences which were firing. A number of ships in the channel tothe south of the island opened fire as the Blenheims turned away from the attackNo enemy aircraft were intercepted on the return flight. All aircraft landedsafely at Debden.62. A number of interception patrols have operated from the fighter groups in England and Scotland in connection with enemy reconnaissance activity of four coasts. The only contact which occurred took place between a Hurricaneand a Heinkel near Farn Island on the 29th. The fighter fired a large numberof rounds into the Heinkel, which dived through low cloud and is believed to havecrashed.Operations of Coastal Command Aircraft.63. An intensive air search has been instituted in northern waters for theDeutschland. Routine patrols, anti-submarine patrols, searches, reconnaissancesand convoy escorts have been continued, though some modification has been necessary.A number of long-range patrols have been carried out by Hudson aircraft to search for enemy aircraft. On the 25th one of these aircraft had an indecisiveengagement with a Dornier 18 and a Heinkel 111 60 miles from Lister Light.On the 29th two Hudsons attacked and shot down a Dornier 18, 70 miles offLister Light.Western Front.64. Owing to very poor weather conditions during most of this period,long-range reconnaissances were not possible. One photographic reconnaissancewas, however, carried out on the 24th over the area Cleve-Borkxtm-Nordhohn.In addition, a number of short reconnaissance sorties were made.
On the 23rd four Dorniers 17 were shot down by British fighters and oneK.E. 111 by British and French fighters (referred to in paragraph 57 above).One of our fighters was forced to land owing to enemy fire, and one crashedon landing as a result of collision with a French fighter. We suffered no othercasualties.During the week 79 fighter patrols were sent up, involving 189 aircraft.Overseas Command. N65. Reconnaissances and anti-submarine patrols have been undertaken by aircraft from the Mediterranean Command, and air escorts have been providedfor ten convoys in the Mediterranean area.Air action has been taken in the Aden Protectorate against local tribes whohave been raiding caravan routes about 150 miles from Aden. On the secondday of the operations, the crew of a forced-landed aircraft were murdered bytribesmen.  Operations are still continuing.
