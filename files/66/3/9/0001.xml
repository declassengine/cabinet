TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.Jt Is requested that special care may be taken;ensure the secrecy of this document.;Tola document is the Property of His /ritannic Majesty&apos; government.109.E T. WAR    CAB I H 5 T. Copy No.,^MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO TURKEY -Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.&apos;IIn pursuance of W.M.(S9)66, Item 10, Sub-Section(ii) (a), the First Sea Lord and I received General Orbaythis afternoon, and informed him as follows:-In the event of Turkey being menaced by Russia,His Majesty1s Government would be disposed, upon Turkishinvitation and in certain circumstances, to come to the aid of Turkey with naval forces superior to those of russian the Black Sea. For this purpose it was necessary thatthe anti-submarine and anti-aircraft defences of the gulf of Smyrna and the Gulf of Ismid should be developed,British technical officers being lent If necessary. Theseprecautions would be additional to the existing plans for placing anti-submarine nets in the Dardanelles and in the bosphorus.We were not now making a promise or entering into any military engagement; and it wsb probable that the contingency would not arise. We hoped that Russia would maintain a strict neutrality, or even possibly becomefriendly. However if Turkey felt herself in danger, and asked for British naval assistance, we would then discussthe situation with her In the light of the Mediterraneansituation and of. the attitude of Italy with the desire toenter into a formal engagement. It might be that the arrival of the British Fleet at Smyrna would in itselfprevent/

prevent Russia from proceeding to extremities, and tbatthe advance of the British Fleet to the Gulf of Ismidwould prevent a military descent by Russia on the mouth of the Bosphorus. At any rate it would be from this position that the operations necessary to establish thecoirmand of the Black Sea would be undertaken.General Orbay expressed himself extremelygratified at this statement.   He aaid that he understoodperfectly there was no engagement. He would report tohis Government on his return, and the necessarypreparatory arrangements at the bases would be undertaken.I aid not attempt to enter into the juridicalaspect as that would no doubt be thrashed-out should &quot;wsever reach the stage where a formal Convention had to bedrawn up.   It was assumed that Turkey would ask forBritish aid only in circumstances when she felt herself in grave danger, or had actually become a belligerent.W.S.C.ADMIRALTY,S.W. 1* : &quot; &apos;1st November,1939.
