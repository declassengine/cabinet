W.November 29, 1939.PURSUIT OF GERMAN AIRCRAFT ENTERING BELGIUM from france.On the 19th November the French Ambassador at Brussels left an aide-memoire with the Secretary-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in thefollowing terms: &quot;In recent weeks, both on outward and return journeys, german aircraft carrying out reconnaissance flights in France have flown over Belgian territory. On return journeys this violation of Belgian neutrality has enabled German machines to escape pursuit by French and British machines,which have turned back at the Belgian frontier.The advantage thus gained by the German aircraft cannot be allowedto continue, and orders will have to be given by the French High Commandthat German machines which, having flown over France, seek to escapethrough Belgium, shall be pursued over Belgian territory.&quot;-2. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris has informed us that this step wastaken at the request of General Gamelin, and that the French authorities do notat present propose that French aircraft should enter Belgian territory to engageGerman aeroplanes coming to France through Belgium, as distinct from thosewhich try to escape by returning from France through Belgium.10730   [20395]SECRET.W.P. (39) 145.
&quot; &quot; &quot;      .... . ,    , \3. General Vuillemin has since informed the Air Ministry, through No. 1Air Mission, that he has been authorised by General Gamelin to permit pursuitonly in the following circumstances: (a) against enemy aircraft retreating into Belgium after combat has startedover France;(6) up to a maximum distance of 10 kilometres beyond the Franco-Belgianfrontier.General Vuillemin has asked whether the Air Ministry are willing to adoptthe same procedure, and is awaiting their agreement before issuing his ownorders.4. The question thus arises as to what instructions should be given to theR.A.F. and what should be said to the Belgian Government on behalf of HieMajesty&apos;s Government. The R.A.F. are at present under the most emphaticorders not to enter Belgium in any circumstances.5. So far as our information goes, it cannot be said that the consequences of German violations of Belgian territory are as yet very serious. At the sametime we cannot well continue to disregard them, especially in view of the,communication which has already been made in Brussels by the French Govern-ment. By flying over Belgium the Germans largely avoid our fighter and anti-aircraft defences, and are thus able to reconnoitre and photograph our positions in France at the minimum risk.6. In reaching a decision on the question we must give due weight to thefollowing considerations: (a) Our own pilots have from time to time inadvertently violated Belgian territory.($) It is desirable, on general grounds, not to cause serious embarrassment to the Belgian Government (His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Parisreports that the Belgian Government were a little nervous at theprospect opened to them by the French communication).      i j(c) We must take the utmost care not to give the enemy any reasonablepretext for violating the neutrality of the Low Countries by land.7. Of these, the last is the most important, and it would be better to put up with certain inconveniences and disadvantages, if there were any real dangerof our giving such a pretext to the enemy. If the Allies now resort to a counter-violatiou as a reprisal for a German violation of Belgian neutrality, this maylead to a cumulative scale of violations and counter-violations tending ultimately to the complete disregard of Belgian air and then perhaps to the occupation&apos; of belgian territory by the enemy.8. If, however, we limit our reprisals to close pursuit of enemy aircraft by our fighters into Belgian air, i.e., when combat had already been joined, oris about to be joined, ovef French territory, and limit the penetration of Belgianair to a prescribed depth (10 kilom.), this would be on the whole unlikely to cause an increasing scale of violations, and the fact that German aircraft hadbeen shot down by the Allies in Belgium could hardly afford the Germans areasonable pretext for drastic action. It is true that this might perhaps Jeadto the enemy sending fighter aircraft into Belgium to meet our fighters, but thereis no strong probability of this.9. From the legal point of view, it would be a legitimate reprisal to pursueGerman aircraft into Belgian air provided that suitable representations hadbeen previously made to the Belgian Government and the facts showed that the belgians were unable to prevent the use of their air by German machines.10. In all the circumstances, it is suggested that the best course would befor His Majesty&apos;s Government to inform the Belgian Government through the diplomatic channel of specific recent cases in which, on outward or returnjourneys or both, German aircraft carrying out reconnaissance flights in Francehave flown over Belgian territory; to point out that this violation of Belgianneutrality has enabled German machines to escape pursuit by French and Britishmachines, which have turned back at the Belgian frontier; to add that theadvantage thus gained by German aircraft cannot be allowed to continue, and
that, in these circumstances, orders will be given to the B.A.F. that, in future.German machines which, having flown over France, seek to escape throughBelgium are to be pursued over Belgian territory. We should add that we intend to use the right which we claim very sparingly, and, in any case, only in the eventof close pursuit, that is to say, when combat has already been joined, or is about to be joined, over French territory.11. The foregoing instructions correspond to the communication made in brussels by the French Government, except (i) That we propose to quote specific instances of German violations of belgian territory,(ii) That we propose to add the last sentence, which is new.12. Before making the proposed communication to the Belgian government it is desirable that the French Government should be notified of our intendedaction, preferably, in the first place, through the diplomatic channel. It shouldalso be suggested to the French Government that it is desirable that in mattersof this kind a common policy should be established before any action is taken,and that it would have been better if the Foreign Office had been consulted beforethe instructions in question were sent to the French Ambassador in Brussels.13. After the communication to the Belgian Government has been made,we should concert with General Vuillemin for the simultaneous issue to Frenchand British aircraft in France of instructions in similar terms to those proposedby General Vuillemin.
