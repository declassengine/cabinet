WEEKLY REPORT (HO. 13) OF AIR OPERATIONS-   AKD IN&apos;m.LIGEiroS rOR&apos;THL TTE5K SiDETG MIDNIGHT3RD DEGaBIIR, 1939.ROYAL AIR FORCE OPSRATIOHS.Bomber Command.Operations apralnst the German Fleet.     On December 3rd,2k Wellington aircraft engaged on a reconnaissance in forceinto the Heligoland Bight located a number of German warshipsoff Heligoland.     The aircraft proceeded to attack, and semi-armour piercing bombs were dropped at heights between 7*000and 10,000 feet.     One section reported hits with a &quot;stick&quot;of three bombs on one of the larger ships, and two near missesclose to one of the smaller vessels.     Another sectionreported one probable hit on a large ship and a very nearmiss, Tmlch must have caused casualties.     Photographs were taken, but owing to the prevailing cloud, and the smoke ofthe bomb explosions, only indifferent results were obtained,and, in consequence, it is difficult to establish definitelythe classes of ships attackedc   . Heavy anti-aircraft fire wasexperienced, and a number of Messerschmitt fighters were seen,but the fighters showed a marked aversion from attacking,apparently holding-off to avoid interfering with the anti-aircraft defences.     The only fighter which made a determinedattack encountered heavy fire from the Wellington reargunners and was shot down.     All our aircraft returned safely.2.    A Striking Force has continued to be held in readiness at advanced bases in Scotland to operate againstthe &quot;Deutschland&quot; or other important units of the GermanNavy located in northern waters.     The bomber squadronsallocated to Coastal Command for attack on enemy units in theNorth Sea have carried out several reconnaissances in force,but no enemy ships have been seen.

. ^ 3292. /    ..    3*.    Reconnaissance of German Naval Bases.     On the night of 27/28th November, six Whitley aircraft were detailed for a night reconnaissance of Wllhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, Heligolandand Brunsbuttel.     As a cover to the operations, leaflets were dropped.     Bad visibility and electrical storms made-reconnaissance extremely difficult, and no information was obtained.Fighter Command.h*     Befance against mine-drooping.     Further measures have been taken to strengthen the air defences of estuarieswhere enemy mines have been dropped.     Light anti-aircraft gunsare being mounted in pairs on paddle vessels &apos;in the^ Thames,and water-borne searchlights are being provided to extend theilluminated zone.in the estuary.     Balloons are already flyingfrom barges in the estuaries of the Thames and Tyne, and atHarwich.     Equipment to aid fighters to intercept in darknessis being installed on high priority.     The Observer Corps and anti-aircraft and searchlight personnel are co-operating withNaval units in plotting the positions of mines which are seen to fall from enemy aircraft.     From the 2nd December a standingpatrol by fighters has been maintained daily during the hoursof daylight between Clacton and the North Foreland with theobject of intercepting hostile aircraft approaching to laymines,5.     Enemy Aircraft.     Fifty nine patrols were despatchedduring the week, but only three aircraft were intercepted andidentified as hostile.     Of these, two were located over the firth of Forth and one was engaged inconclusively before it took refuge in the clouds.     The third, a Heinkel 111, was intercepted above the clouds about eight miles off Amble by a fighter which took off by instruments in bad weather.     On/emerging

emerging from the clouds, the pilot closed the enemy, firingcontinuously.    After the first hurst, the enemy&apos;s rear gunstopped firing and the aircraft, pouring out smoke, tinned onits side and dived into the clouds-.     The fighter pilot, whofollowed closely, only saw the sea just in time to pullviolently out of his dive.     It may he assumed that the enemy aircraft was unable to recover before striking the water;and this is confirmed by an independent report of an aircraftseen to dive into the sea.6.     Long-range Fighter Raid on Borkum.     On 28thNovember, twelve Blenheim fighters of Kos. 25 and 601Squadrons were despatched to the seaplane base at Borkum to search for and attack enemy seaplanes or flying boatspreparing or taking off for attacks against this country.The attack was a complete surprise, and met with no fighteropposition.     The Blenheims carried out repeated attacks onfive seaplanes on the slipways and on enemy pom-pom and machine gun positions.     All aircraft returned safely.Coastal Command.7.     Routine patrols, anti-subiuarine patrols, searches,reconnaissance and convoy escorts continued throughout theweek.     The extensive search for the -&quot;Deutschland&quot; which wascarried out, necessitated some modification to the northernpatrols.     H.M. Submarine &quot;Triad&quot;, which had been damaged by heavy weather near the Norwegian coast, was given aprotective escort of Hudson aircraft on three consecutive daysuntil she put in to Stavanger for repairs.     In the course ofthis duty there were a number of engagements with enemy aircraft.     In all, six Bornier 18&apos;s were encountered, all ofwhich were engaged.     One Dornier 18 was shot down, and asecond was damaged, the rear gunner being shot.

8.     During the week, three enemy submarines were sighted.     Two of the U-boats were attacked, and although itis not considered that the first of these suffered damage,the second, which was attacked on December 3rd, ho miles north-west of Terschelling by an Anson aircraft, received adirect hit on the base of the conning tower.     OiX andwreckage were thrown up by the explosion, and photographswere taken confirming the result.     It is believed that thissubmarine was of the large ocean-going type.9.     In addition to the combats referred to inparagraph 7, there were two further engagements with enemy aircraft, the results of which were indecisive.10.   Thirty eight convoys have been provided with airescort, involving the employment of 118 aircraft.Advanced Air Striking Force.11.   A number of fighter patrols were despatched duringthe week, but no engagements were reported.Royal Air Force Component of the British Expeditionary Force.12.   Bomber Squadrons.     A reconnaissance cf north-west germany was carried out by a single aircraft on December 3rd.The task was photographic reconnaissance from Erkenz toCleves and visual reconnaissance for&quot; pontoon bridges acrossthe Rhine.     A trench and fortification system betweenSchwanenberg and Weberg was reported, but no pontoon bridgeswere observed and there was no unusual rail activity..Overseas Commands.13.   Anti-submarine patrols have been undertaken by aircraft from the&quot; Mediterranean and Aden Commands, and inaddition, air escorts have been provided for convoys in theMediterranean area.     The operations by the Aden Command/against

against the Wahidi tribe referred to in Weekly Report No.12are still proceeding, hut no further details are yet available.INTUiLIGgliCE.German Air Force.1b,.   Bomber and Fighter Squadrons.     Two bomber unitsnormally located in Silesia are now believed to be located inthe Wurzburg area (S.E. of Frankfurt).     There has been noknown change in the distribution of the German fighter force.15&quot;   Reconnaissance.     The reconnaissance unit based atMunster has been carrying out frequent flights in the southern half of the North Sea during the week.     The duties of thisunit include meteorological observations.16.   Coastal Squadrons-     The activity of German coastalaircraft in the North Sea has continued.     On November 25thflying boats believed to be from a unit based on the Island ofSylt shadowed naval units, including the third destroyer flotilla.     Two unsuccessful bombing attacks were made by about six aircraft.     On November 29th, there was again considerablereconnaissance activity between the Shetlands and theNorwegian coast.     About twenty aircraft took part andremained in the vicinity for three hours.     This activity mayhave been due to the fact that there was a British &quot;cruiserline&quot; in the area.17.   Enemy Air Activity over France.     Weather conditionsrestricted German reconnaissance activity over eastern France.Enemy reconnaissances were,   however, made over the Rhinefront, the Calais coast, the Franco-Belgian frontier, and the saar front.     A more extensive flight was made on December3rd over, districts in Burgundy and Champagne./French Air Force.
