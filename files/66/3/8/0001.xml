TOR CABINET.MILITARY IMPLICATIONS OP A GERMAN INVASION OF HOLLAND.Report by tho Chiefs of Staff Commlttoo.We have examined the military implicationB of a german attack on Holland by land and/or by sea, assuming that Germanystops short of an invasion of Belgium.   We have considered(a) How this attack might be carried out.(b) What action we could take to stop it.(c) What would be the results on our strategicbriefly of:(a) Forward Defences - the line of the Rivers IJSSELand HAAS.(b) Intermediate Defences - In the North - the GREBBE line(inundated).   In the South - the PEEL Marshes whichare partial obstacles to large scale movements andhave behind them a line of road blocks and pill boxes. and the ZUID WLLLEMSVAART Canal as a support to this line.(c) Inner Defences.(i)   The New Holland Line (Inundated),(ii)   The AMSTERDAM Defences.BOnly attached to copies issued to members of the War Cabinet.position if it were successfuloIB&apos;The Dutch defences (shown on the attached map)   consist

15.       The Batch Army (now mobilised.) consists of 8 divisions and 1 light Division.    Their present dispositions (videmap) are, in general:North of Biver SHINE - 4 Divisions.Between Piver SHUTS and thcVTLtEJiSWiAKr end-al - 2 Divisions.South-East of PEEL Marshes - 1 Light Division,Behind New Holland Line -   Divisions.The Army is ill-equipped and inadequately trained to resist a first-class enemy. The anti-aircraft.defences are quite inadequate-4.        The Dutch Air Force is not intended for anything morethan a limited amount of close co-operation with the Army.5.        The Dutch maintain no naval forces in Europe capableof. offensive operations.     A certain number of coast defence Units are available for the local defence of ports.6.  &apos;    The main German rail communications to the dutch frontier pass through EMMERICH, CLEVE and GENNEP.     Theselead directly to that part of Dutch territory most Bui table for rperations, &quot;is. the country lyiag between the RHINEand the PEEL Marshes.     It seenis likely, therefore, thatthe main German attack would be put in astride the WAAL.The Germans could employ a force of some 12 Divisions inthis area.     The main attack could be combined with an advance to the lixe :f the River USSEL..7.        A second possible line of advance is throughROESM0ND,     The gap between the PEEL Marshes and the Belgianfrontier is, however, so narrow that it is unlikely thatthis line would be employed, at least for the primaryadvance.

8.        It is unlikely that the Butch could put up any effective resistance in their forward defences and it isprobable that the Germans would quickly over-run the country at least up to the New Holland line.    Thereafter theinundations might impose some delay but it would only bea matter of time before the country wbb completely over-run.9.        The Germans would probably employ their air forcesin direct support of the Army in the normal way, though it    -1b possible that parachute troops might be used in the later stages to create disorganisation in the AMSTERDAM-EOTTERBAM area.10.      We have considere d the pos sibility of the Germanscarrying out some form-of sea-borne land attack againstHolland.     In view of the ease with which they could over-run the country by invasion over the common frontier, wecan see no reason why they should expose themselves to. the risks   and difficulties attendant on a venture of this nature.     The German transports and their escorts would he    .vulnerable to British naval and air attack, and the sea communications for the subsequentjasiiitenance-of the force would also be open to-attack.FRANCO-BRITISH ACTION TO DEFEND HOLLAND. ASSUMINGBELGIUM WAS NEUTRAL.At Sea.11.      On the assumption that there was no seaborne expedition,the British Navy could not give any direct assistance to holland in resisting aggression, ether than maintainingAn &apos;hotewn ffnT 1 nnr. and-ffrmt. to..T1.

12.      The most potent deterrent to a German attack onHolland probably lies in the fact that Rotterdam, whichis the greatest entrepot port in Europe, is, as long asHolland remains neutral, an extremely important channelfor German imports.Assistance with Land Forces13.      Even if it were possible to reinforce Dutch troopswith British or French land forces sent by sea, anyexpedition of this kind would be vulnerable to German air attack.     Moreover, it would be impossible in the time available to establish in Holland a force of sufficient strength to give any effective assistance.     It would,therefore, probably only be a short time before we shouldbe faced with the problem of withdrawing this force from holland,in still more difficult circumstances.14.       Even if political conditions permitted, it wouldbe unwise, in view of the Allied numerical inferiorityon land and in the air, to attempt an advance throughBelgium in order to assist Holland.15.      It Is clear, therefore, that we are not in aposition to assist Holland on Innrt.

Assistance by Air.16*       British bombers could attack the German armies invadingHolland and their communications from bases in this country andPrances though from the latter tney would have to fly roundBelgium.   The German Air Forces, however, would be greatly,superior in strength to our own, and choreas we should be operating far from our bases, the Germans would be close to theirown.   Further9 our intervention against the German military forces might lead to heavy air attack on this country; the subsequentaction of our bombers aoula then have to be determined by considerations of the security of Great Britian, and we CEnnotforecast how long we could render support to the Dutch Army.   Inany event we could not hope to impose more than a slight delayon the German invasion.The larger issue of whether a counter to an invasion of holland, should^ as in the case of an invasion of Belgium, be an air attack on the Ruhr, is being dealt with as a separate issue.17.       It should be noted that so soon as the integrity of holland was violated, British and German bombers would be able to fly direct to attack objectives in each others&apos; countries.Denial of Dutch Resources to the Enemy.13.       Plans have been prepared and the necessary forces have been organised to destroy certain defences, oil stocks and other facilities in Holland, subject to the connivance and co-operationof the Dutch authorities.   The purpose of these demolitions wouldbe to deny their use to the enemy&apos;s and they would not htmper theGerman occupation of Holland.Conclusion.19o       Prom the above it seems quite impossible for France and ourselves to prevent a German occupation of Holland.   We might be able to retard the invasion to a very limited extenthy air attack, but such action would be expensive in casualitiesand would have no effect in the long run.-5-   &quot; -     . -   -;&apos;&quot;

THE BFF-30T OK GREAT BRITAIN OP A GI3KAN OCCUPATTOB OP ftnTJ-ATTO.Haval Operations.20.     Gei-many could use Dutch ports for her submarines and light surface craft.     These ports are within striking distancein air striking power makes it improbable that we could maintainattacks against them for long.     The threat to our East Coastshipping and cross-channel communications would be increasedboth from naval and air action.     On the other hand theoperation of our Northern Contraband Control would be facilitated.Air Operations.21,     Germany could bring London and certain other importanttargets within reach of her short-range bombers, and moreovercould escort her bombers with fighters to a far greater extent than she is now able to do.     German heavy bombers, by flyingdirect across Holland, could maintain a higher scale of effortagainst the British Isles and damaged aircraft would not have to face the dangers of the long return journey over the sea to north-West Germany.     If the German Air Force were attackingshipping, German bombers could reach areas, including the Channel,with greater ease than if they had to fly round the North of holland.22.     As soon as Germany invaded Holland we should be free to fly-over Dutch territory.     This is the shortest route to the Ruhrfrcci our aerodromes *in East Anglia and would involve the.leastpenetration of the present German air defences.

f 1^     III   t liM^83Land Operations.23.       Once Germany was established in Holland she could attack Belgium simultaneously from both the BorHiand the Bast, and thus facilitate any subsequent out-flanking movement against the Western Front.    By thusbroadening -the area through which her communications toher right flank would pass, Germany would increase the case with which she could reinforce and maintain troops on that flrak.24.        It is possible that an invasion of Holland mighthave the effect of deciding the Belgians to collaborate with the French and ourselves in the formulation of plans to meet a further advance into Belgium.23-        Although an invasion of Great Britain would still be subject to most serious difficulties, thecomplete occupation of Holland by Germany would shorten the sea passage if she decided to attempt any suchoperation^     It would also permit her to cover theoperation with more fighter aircraft.&apos; 5--          Airman occupation of South WeBt Holland andthe islands off the mouth of the Schelt would enablethem completely to control the navigation of the Scheltand the approaches to Antwerp.    Apart from the fact thatthe occupation of this area would give the Germans a footing in the rear of the defences of the Belgiannational rsdoubt, it would give them a strangleholdover JB-Csiaa trade.Other theatres of War.27.       Ths fact that Holland had been brought into tht-war would rneiv that we should have the collaboration of the Dutch in the East Indies.
