THIS DOCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.  63- - -   It is requested that special care may be taken to*^ E C R E T. ensure the secrecy of this document.W.P.(39) 1S6. i ,$aflKTSi.,   FOR INFORMATION.j COPY NO. cJ-iy.WAR CABINET. -GERMAN INVASION OF HOLT./\pn.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF COIGJgTEE.At the meeting of the War Cabinet held on 9th Novemberx an explanation was given of the French plan for an advance into Belgium, in the event of a requestof the Belgian Government, following the discussions whichhad taken place in Paris on the same day, betweenthe Chief of the Air Staff and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff and Generals Gamelin and Georges.2.        The main feature of the plan was an Anglo-Frenchadvance to certain pre-arranged lines in Belgium^ the selection of which would depend on the time and spaceproblem, if a German invasion took place.     These projectedoperations had been previously agreed between the french high Command and the British Comnander-in-Chief.J.        A novel feature of the French plan was the proposalto occupy with French forces the Dutch islands of Walcherenand South Beveland.     This project had not previously beenconsidered by the British Chiefs of Staff and, at theconclusion of the Meeting with General Gamelin, he had asked that the plan should be studied by the British Staffs andthat they should inform the French High Command as to theextent to which British naval, military and air forces could co-operate, if the plan v;as put into operation.4.        Subsequent to the meeting between the Chiefs of Staff(see paragraph 1 above) a note wes received from the french high Command, explaining in aore precise terms the roasonswhich, in their view, rendered it very desirable to seize the Dutch islands in question.     These, in summary, are asfollows:-(a) The occupation of the Islands would provide an essential measure of protection to the left wing of the Allied forces whetheroperating on the Waal or on the Scheldtitself.(b) The occupation of the Islands would providethe only possible liaison with the Southernving of the Dutch defensive forces situatedeither in the Bergen-op-Zoom and Rosendaal.3cW.M.(39) 77th Conclusions, Minute 1.-1-

(c) The Islands must be occupied if the Scheldtis to be held since otherwise Allied forces might be attacked, from the rear by enemy forces occupy ng them. -(d) Our occupation of the Islands would preventenemy vessels, stationed in the eastern mouth of the Scheldt, from shelling Antwerp.S.       In accordance with General Gaaelin1 s request, referredto in paragraph 3 above, the French plan, and its implicationsas far as British co-operation was concerned, were consideredby the Joint Planning Sub-committee, and on the basis oftheir Report we issued a Dircctif to the British permanent military Representatives, authorising them to inform theirFrench colleagues that we were prepared to co-operate asfollows :-(a) Naval Assistance.British light nave.1 forces could be disposed togive strategic cover to French troops moved by sea from Dunkirk or ^eebrugge to Flushing.   Twoanti-aircraft cruisers could support the Frenchexpedition for the short period while it is in actual process of moving to Flushing.(b) Assistance on Land.No British troops would be available to take partin the operation.   Nor could r.e convey smallbodies of troops to Flushing by air, since theonly aircraft available are a number of assortedtypes of uncrmed civil aircraft, which era quiteunsuitable to send into an area   which may be full of -enen-y fighters.   Some anti-aircraft artillerynight be mace available to protect the French.motorized Divisions on their move up to occupy the islands.(c) Air Assistance.Arrangements already exist for the operation ofour bobber forces to delay the enemy invasion of rlollanc and assist the move of the army forwardinto Belgium.   The French have urged us.to affordfighter protection to their operations on thecoast and to the seizure of the Dutch Islands..This.question is now un^er discussion by thePer;..anent military Representatives, but the line we are taking is.that, since fighter patrols overi the Dutch Islthds from Kent could only bespasmodic and ineffective, any additionalfighter squadrons that can be spared from thiscountry should be employed in the centre wherethe other British fighter squadrons already  -in France will be opereting, thus releasingFrench fighters to cover their own operations on the cocst from bases in northern France.

6.        Details of the British co-operation, in accordancewith paragraph y above, are now being discussed with theFrench Permanent 1&apos;ilitary Representatives.   Theconclusions reached will then be translated into plansby the appropriate French and British Staffs.(Signed) C.L.1T.
