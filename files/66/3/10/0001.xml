THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYfjwNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.C R B- *COPY hoWAR CABINET. .air BxaoiREunrjs for the ably.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.1.       In accordance with the decision reached by the WarCabinet on 19th October, 19S9 (v;.L. (39;53rd Conclusions, Linute11) s the Land Forces Committee have had under consideration the air requirements for the Army, and in particular theprovision of close support aircraft for the Army.     The WarOffice draw the lesson from the German operations in Polandthat the Army should have under its control large numbers of close support aircraft, and, since we at present possess no special aircraft of this type, they suggest that we should atonce design and build an aircraft of simple construction onmass-produced lines s which could probably be provided fromcapacity not required by the Air liinistry.     They furtherexpress the hope that the new aircraft could be produced in quantity for the Spring campaign of 1940, and be brought intooperation therein as a* surprise to the enemy.2.       Examination has shown that it is most unlikely that special aircraft of this type can be made available by the spring of 1940, but the ./ar Office and the Air kinistry haveagreed to produce two prototypes of a special close supportaircraft of the general characteristics asked for by the WarOffice.Pending the production of these two prototypes, thereis no further action which could usefully be taken to develop a new aircraft of this kind.3. Tiicre remains the question of the action to be takento meet the War T^fice requirements for the spring campaign of 1940.

The present arrangements for the air supportof the Army are as follows:-Air Component.Eeconnaisance aircraft.Small numbers of bomber and fighter aircraft.Permanently undercommand of theArmy.Advanced Air-S triking Force.Bomber aircraft.Placed s&quot;t thedisposal of theArmy by arrange-ment with theCommander,Advanced Air-Striking Force or with the AirMinistry.Air-StrikinpForce.(Bomber Command)Bomber aircraft.Placed at thedisposal of theArmy by consentof the AirMinistry or alternatively,by decision ofthe War Cabinet.4.For the spring campaign of 1940, the Army require-ment of bomber aircraft, over and above the Air Componentmentioned in paragraph 3, is assessed by the War Office onthe basis of 12 to 15 Divisions, as 250 first-line aircrafttogether with the necessary maintenance reserves of pilots and machines.     It is the view of the Secretary of Statefor War that the arrangements outlined above for providingthese aircraft from the advanced Air Striking Force and theAir Striking Force are inadequatte to meet Army needs.He asks that the aircraft should be placed under control of the Army and should thus be primarily availablefor duties in connection with army operations.    Accordinglyhe wishes to establish the principle that the Army must be directly responsible for the command of, and ultimately forthe training and maintenance of its own close support aircraft,just as of any other of its supporting arms, e.g.artillery or tanks.     Further he maintains that pilotsfor close support bomber duties must be familiar withthe methods of the arm -vrhich they are supporting andshould therefore come predominantly from that arm.

5.       The Secretary of State for Air states that he cannotproduce 250 additional first line aircraft complete withpilots and reserves by the spring of 1924.0, and that thereforethis Force could only be placed at the exclusive disposalof the Army by t eking it away from the Air Striking Force.He^points out that the Air Force which we have been building up will provide only a minimum standard of protection against the German 3omber Force and that it must be seriously inadequate for a long time to come for the counter^offensive role.     The withdrawal from the Air striking force of the 250 first-line aircraft and reserves requiredby the Army would reduce the counter-offensive force by about50$ of its strength, and in the opinion of the Air ministry would weaken our standard of air defence to a most dangerousdegree.6.        !dy colleagues will see that a fundamental difference of opinion has arisen between the War Office and the AirMinistry.     in the opinion of the former, the close supportbomber aircraft required by the Army for next year&apos;s campaignshould be placed primarily at the disposal of the Army andunder its command, and should only be released for other duties against the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief in theField by an over-riding decision of the War Cabinet.     Onthe other hand, the Air Ministry state that these bomber aircraft can only be provided by depleting our existingcounter-offensive bomber resources to a dangerous extent,end that they must, therefore, remain part of the air striking Force as at&apos; present, and be placed at the disposalof the Army only by consent of the. Air Ministry, or alternatively, by decision of the War Cabinet.

7.        The question of principle at issue cannot Tie dealtwith by the Lend Forces Committee and I refer it accordingly to the War Cabinet.(Intd.) S.H.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.2nd November, 1939.
