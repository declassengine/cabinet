DOCOHEKT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT&amp;NKIO MAJEBTTB GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that speoial care may ba taken to .ensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET COPY NO.^^W.P.(39) 102THE AIR STRENGTHS OF GREAT BRITAIN.     1      &apos;FRANCE AND GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1.      At their 32nd Meeting held on the 30th September,the War Cabinet took note of a statement prepared by theAir Ministry showing the air strength of this country andFrance in relation to the air strength of Germany, and asked me to furniBh certain additional information on theproduction position during the next six months:   on the increases that would be made in the number of first-linesquadrons:   on the air personnel situation;   and on types of aircraft in this country and in Germany.Production.2.       The figure for production in this country duringthe month of September was 892.K    During October we must expect an appreciably lower figure&quot; and it is unlikely thatthe September figure will be exceeded during the sixmonths&apos; period covered by the War Cabinet Conclusion.This falling off is to be attributed to four main causesjo(i) The calling up of reservists and otherpersonnel with Service obligations employedwith aircraft and allied industries:(ii) Black-out conditions:(iii) The stoppage of American deliveries:   and^The corresponding figures since ApriTT&quot; 1938, have been:-Aprll 1938 - 158: October 1938 - 348: April 1939 - 670.

(iv),The fact that the peak figure has now been passed in the production of certain types.In.addition more than the usual 10% of output is being .diverted for the production of spares.S.      Bearing in mind these factors, the first twoof which though undoubtedly marked are difficult to assesswith accuracy, the following estimate has been prepared by-types.   It is, of course, subject to the assumption thatthe factories are not hampered by air attack.ClaBS of Aircraft &apos;	Dec.1939.	Mar.1940.Bombers (Air Striking Force) Fighters Army Co-operation and Reconnaissance. Coastal and ship-borne Bomber transport Trainers	.260 120 40 110 4 200	2B0 165 40 145 4 170 1	734                  804	If American deliveries are resumed they will be mainly inthe Coastal and Trainer classes, during the six monthsunder review.This forecast may prove to have been too cautiousand conservative, and in any case I should anticipate a sharp rise in production, particularly in fighters, in the months following March, 1940, as new capacity comes intooperation.I should, perhaps also mention that the figureshown against &quot;Bombers (Air Striking Force)&quot; includes anumber of Blenheim aircraft which are actually being converted and uBed as fighters.   Although originally designed as a bomber this type has been found valuable as a fighter,

particularly for night work and for long range work ove*the North Sea. .4.      It is exceedingly difficult to forecast theFrench delivery figures during the next six months.   Iwas informed last week by the French Air Minister thattheir September delivery figure was 318 aircraft ofservice types.   To this must be added some output oftraining aircraft.   He went on to say, however, that the .French Air Ministry anticipate a fall In October due tothe calling up of reservists.. They also anticipate that the effects of this calling up will be felt through-out the period.   While, therefore, they anticipate being able to improve upon the September figure, I am doubtfulwhether we should be wise to count on any substantial increase. &quot;5.      It is even more difficult in existingcircumstances to calculate German production.   Steps have certainly been taken in Germany to screen the aircraft industry from the full effects of general mobilisation.The Germans were, moreover, in the position of having morepotential capacity available for immediate use than either the French or ourselves.   So far as we can judge too ameasure of priority is still being given to aircraft work.Difficulties may of course develop in Germany, e.g. inregard to labour or the supply of raw materials, but Ithink that we must assume that the production position inGermany as compared with this country and France will, atthe end of the next six months, certainly not be less favourable to Germany than It is at present, and that itmay be appreciably more favourable.Increases in first-line strength.-t---6.      it is clearly Impossible, without knowledge ofthe probable course of operations during the next six

ISmonths, to forecast the increase which may be effected inour first line strength.   The rate of wastage which we .&apos;.shall experience during that period is an unknown factor,but it is one which, as explained in the fuller- note at appendix &quot;A&quot;, governs the rate of expansion which we mightachieve.   As the experience of this war has beeninsufficient to produce reliable data regarding currentwastage, detailed forecasts can only be based on twohypotheses.   First, we can assume peace rates of wastageof which we have long experience.   Alternatively, we canassume war rates of wastage on the scale.which has alreadybeen estimated as probable during a period of sustainedoperations.&apos;7.       Steps are now being taken to form 18 additionalsquadrons during the next month.   On the first hypothesie,-this measure of expansion will result in a first-line strength on 31st March, 1940, of 1,948 aircraft includingthe Fleet Air Arm.   On the second hypothesis this strengthcould not be reached, and in fact there would be somedecrease in the numbers already mobilized.Personnel..8.      The establishment in flying personnel and skilledtradesmen required by 31st March, 1940, to man thisexpanded Force are as follows:-   &quot;Flying Personnel.Pilots . 12,150Observers 1,600Air Crews 3,450Skilled Tradesmen.Fitter Group 32,600Wireless and electrical Group 11,000Instrument Group 1,800Armament Group 5,000* -Recruitment and training have been calculated   -in such a way that this establishment should be provided

even on the second hypothesis, i,e., oasualties resultingfrom sustained operations, and it is anticipated even atthis rate of wastage that requirements will be met in mostcategories.   Some difficulty may be experienced in providing the full complement of observers if the wastageis as high as has been assumed, and dilution will berequired in the principal ground trades.Types of aircraft.... .9.      I attach as Appendix &quot;B&quot; particulars of aircraft in service and in production in this country and inGermany.   I would again stress the extreme difficulty of attempting to draw exact comparisons in this matter.New types are constantly being developed, but the mainstrength of any armed service will at any one time lie intypes which have been in production for some time..  It isessential too to bear in mind that in air warfare aircraftdo not normally engage with aircraft of the same type.The bomber does not, for instance, engage bomber.   Theimportance of fire power must also be constantly in mind,and In this connection it is necessary to take account ofthe considerable advantage possessed by British types inthe power-operated turret.   The individual workmanship isalso better in British types, and this country, of course,possesses a considerable advantage in regard to engines.10.      The German Air Force are at present using a fuelof about 87 octane, but there are no technical difficulties in the way of producing and using a fuel of100 octane.   The Eoyal Air Force is similarly situated,and considerable reserves of 100 octane fuel have alreadybeen accumulated in this country.&apos;28.10.1939.K.W.

APPENDIX A.- -THE WASTAGE FACTOR IN RELATION TO--&quot;HRST-LlME STRENGTH.&apos;    ;-1.      The Increases In our home defence and continentalair strength which it may be possible to make between new and31st March 1940 depend almost entirely upon the incidence ofwar wastage during the period in question *   If we could be certain that wastage will continue to be negligible, the bulkof our resources could be devoted to increases in our first-line strength and to a contingent expansion of our training organisation.     If, however, wastage turnsoutto be continu-ously in excess of production, the first-line strength and reserves of the force will automatically decrease..  very limited wastage may be incurred for a considerable period -as in the last six weeks; but all measures of developmenttaken during this period must in common prudence take accountof the possibility of increased wastage at any time in thefuture. . The increase from the present low rate may be suddenand very marked.     If first-line expansion were to be continuedwithout regard to this possibility, then the force, whensuddenly subjected to serious wastage incurred in intensiveoperations, would be lacking in adequate resouroes of material and personnel to maintain it in action, and the first-linesquadrons would suffer what might amount to a collapse inoperational efficiency,2,      In view of the considerations outlined above, it hasalways been a cardinal point in our policy to conduct ourdevelopment programme with continuous regard to the possiblewastage factor.   Up to now new squadrons have not been formeduntil some reserves could be made available for them, althougheven this did not prevent the outbreak&apos;of war imposing upon ussome measure of tolling up1 of first-line strength in order toprovide adequate reserves to meet the possible rate of wastage*

3,      The experience of this war up to date has not givenus sufficient information or opportunity&quot;to make a reliableassessment of the average rate of wastage which is likely tobe r-xperienced over any given period.   Forecasts of possibleincreases in first-line strength based on production output andwa/raK? must, therefore, as regards the latter factor be basedon1 assumptions.   Such assumptions are extremely difficult toBlake, particularly as wastage is a factor which varies in/degree for different types of squadrons, for different indlvi-&apos; dual types of aircraft and for differont forms of employment.4o      Before the outbreak of hostilities when no experience whatever of average war wastage was available, aseries of hypothetical wastage factors had to be adduced bythe Air Staff in a detailed form suitable for use in pre-wardevelopment projects and in provisioning.   Assuming that thesehypothetical calculations are found to be approximately correctin the light of future events (and the rates have been worked out with great care on the best advice and information obtain-able) they afford one possible basis for a forecast of thedevelopment of the Royal Air Force up to 51st March 1940.But if no account whatever is taken of potential war wastage(and there is no practical alternative at this stage betweendoing this and making use of the previously calculated wastagefigures mentioned above), then a very different picture of airforce development during the same period is presented.5.      If the Air Staff !s hypothetical calculations provesubstantially correct, the anticipated war output of aircraft during the period under review (even with no deduction toallow for the direct or indirect effects of enemy actionagainst the industry) will not equal -the estimated wastage Inany type of operational aircraft.   If, howerar, the AtrComponent of the Field Force continues to be only lightly

engaged during the period under review, and if Bomber and fighter Command are not called upon to undertake sustainedoperations, the situation will be appreciably better thanthat indicated above.6.      In practice we shall be able, as experience of war conditions extends, to assess to what extent- oui&apos; husbanding of resources is justified, and to devote those resources which it longer 3eems essential to hold in reserve to a policy ofmore-extended development.   Similarly we shall in due course be able to judge the relative importance cf short-term and long-term policies.   If at any time the progress of war shewsclearly a vital need for a greater first-line effort for alimited period only, and justifies air preparations for thefuture being subordinated to present needs, there is no doubtthat our system of development is sufficiently flexible toenable the requisite action to be taken,   Since the outbreakof war, additional first-line squadrons have in fact been raised out of resources originally designed to meet wastage.This, however, is a policy which if carried to extremes willnot only be detrimental to our vital reserves of material and personnel,, but will also result in a grave risk of a sudden and-rapid weakening of our operational air strength.
