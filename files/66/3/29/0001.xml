NAVAL SITUATION.General Reyiew.AT the present time, when the U-boats&apos; attack on British trade has beenreduced to small proportions and heavy attack by surface raiders and aircraft on-pur sea communications has&apos;not yet developed, it is convenient to review thegeneral naval position as it has developed in the opening weeks of the war.2. The initial distribution of the Fleet, in addition to countering german naval action, had to take into account the possibility of a hostile Italy and of anuncertain Japan. The British main fleet was concentrated in the North toprevent the passage of German surface raiders into the Atlantic, and to supportthe few cruisers that could be spared initially to intercept German shipping and for the operation of contraband control between Iceland and the north of Scotland. A strong fleet was also necessary in the Eastern Mediterranean, andthis, coupled with the escort requirements for the move of our land and airforces to the continent, left comparatively small forces available for the protectionof trade.The initial U-boat attack found us, therefore, with our anti-submarineforces greatly reduced by other commitments, and the institution of the convovsystem, which was at once set in motion, placed an even greater strain on ourlight forces. Gradually, with the help of carrier-borne aircraft, the first onslaughtof the U-boats was overcome and they were driven to seek their targets further to the westward; but shortage of light craft limited the extent to which escort forconvoys could be provided.3. As the attitude of Italy and Japan clarified, we were able to reduce our forces in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Far East; and, when it became clear that one, if not two, German pocket battleships were operating in the Atlantic, arrangements were made for powerful hunting units to cover the important focal areas of trade in the North and South Atlantic and theIndian Ocean.The completion of the movement of the British Expeditionary Force and theAir Striking Force to France made more destroyers available for trade protection.At about the same time armed merchant cruisers and auxiliary forces started to come into service. During this time it became urgently necessary to strengthen the anti-aircraft escorts of the East Coast convoys and to institute Scandinavianconvoys, which brought a further heavy demand for destroyers and escort vessels.The Dominion Governments quickly appreciated the importance of destroyerforces, and took action to make such forces available for the common cause as early as possible.4. Another phase in the naval situation is now developing. The Mediter-ranean Fleet has been further reduced, and, while hunting groups for enemy armoured ships are being maintained in the focal areas in the Atlantic and indian Oceans, it has become necessary to reinforce the light forces on theEast Coast of England to meet the possibilities of German raids. With so many claims on bur destroyer forces, difficulty will be experienced for some timeto come in providing adequate naval escorts for the convoys which are now infull operation from Halifax and Sierra Leone, to and from Gibraltar, on theEast Coast, and to and from Norway. The intensification of German minelayingactivities in the North Sea has made a serious addition to our naval problems.5. In each phase the requirements have thrown a very heavy burden on theFleet and, except for the essential refuelling periods, ships have been almostcontinuously at sea. ,Throughout, close co-operation has been maintained with the French ^navy&apos;which has helped to meet the general requirements of the Naval Situation. as new ships come into service and further auxiliary vessels are completed, it. istoped that it will be possible to provide time for the refitting of ships and forthe rest and recreation of personnel.
Home Waters. r6. H.M. destroyer Blanche was sunk and. HM. minelaying cruiserAdventure severely damaged by mines off the Tongue Lightship in the thames estuary.The known casualties to date are : Blanche Officers: 3 wounded.Eatings : 1 killed, 1 missing, 15 wounded (2 seriously).Adventure Officers: Nil.Ratings : 17 killed, 8 missing, 69 wounded (3 seriously).It is thought that the mines were probably of the magnetic type.7. H.M. Auxiliary Trawler Northern Rover must be considered lost, with officers and 23,ratings. She was last sighted in Fair Island Channel on the30th October, an/was due to return to harbour on the 5th November. She waseraploved on the Northern Contraband Control Service.8. On the 13th November, ships at Sollum Voe, Shetlands, were attackedbv German aircraft. There were no hits on ships or casualties to personnel. Theenemy were engaged by A.A. fire from the ships.9. An explosion occurred on board British S.S. Pacific Coast (1,210 tons)at Brest on the 9th November. Sabotage is not suspected. The casualties were9 British dead, and 7 wounded. An officer on the British Naval Staff at Brest wasamong the wounded.German Attack on Sea-borne Trade.10. During the past week in Home Waters four ships have been sunk by mine and two by direct submarine action. Of these, five were British (total tonnage 11,359) and one Norwegian (11,019 tons). These figures, as do last week&apos;slosses, suggest the increasing use of the mine in the attack on trade.11. The first loss by mine occurred off Seaham Harbour, 10 miles south ofthe Tyne, on the 9th November, when the S.S. Carmarthen Coast (961 tons) sank.Two men were killed in the boiler room and the remainder of the crew escapedin ship&apos;s boats, four being wounded.12. The other three ships were all mined in the vicinity of the TongueLight Vessel off the mouth of the Thames. Here, on the 13th November, theS.S. Ponzano (1,346 tons), homeward bound with a cargo of fruit from Lisbon,sank without loss of life. Her crew, two of whom were wounded, were saved bya trawler. The Ponzano had been shelled by a U-boat on the 10th Novemberwhen north-west of Cape Finisterre. She was unarmed and not in convoy, butmanaged on that occasion to escape in the darkness.A few hours later on the 13th November S S. Matra (8,003 tons), with a cargo of foodstuffs from Baltimore, U.S.A., was mined in the same vicinity.Two men were killed. The rest of her crew were rescued by the Margate LifeBoat and a passing tanker, twenty-two being wounded. The ship grounded andwas later refloated, but had to be beached again.On the 14th November S.S. Woodtown (794 tons), a small tanker, also strucka mine near the Tongue Light Vessel. Nine of the crew were lost and foursaved.13. On the 12th November the trawler Cresswell (275 tons) was attacked by gunfire by TJ. 41, 18 miles north-west of the Flannan Islands, Western Hebrides.Survivors escaped on a raft and two hours after were taken on board thesubmarine and later transferred to the trawler Phyllesia. Six of the crew are believed to have been lost. .^ hile the trawler&apos;s crew were on board, TJ. 41 torpedoed the NorwegianS-S- Arne Kjode (tanker 11,019 tons) without warning. It is understood thatthe ship was carrying petrol for Germany and was hoping to avoid our contraband control. The A rne Kjode did not sink, but broke in two and two days later was[20333] &apos;.- b 2
sighted by an air patrol. Ships were sent out to effect salvage, but this was notpossible and the two portions were sunk by gunfire. Thirty-five of the crew havebeen rescued, but five are still missing.14. A report reached the Admiralty on the 16th November of the sinking of S.S. Africa Shell (700 tons), a small coastal oiler, 150 miles north-east ofLourenco Marques by an enemy raider, &quot;a 10,000-ton ship.&quot; No news hasbeen received of the four British ships reported overdue at Freetown, and itwould seem that this report may be connected with their disappearance.15. There is almost certainly one pocket battleship at sea and it is consideredpossible that she may have gone round the Cape of Good Hope into the indian ocean.From interrogation of the master and crew of the Norwegian S.S. Tyrifjord(3,080 tons) it appears that this vessel was stopped by a German warship onthe 4th November about 700 miles north-east of Newfoundland. There is noconclusive evidence that this was the Deutschland.16. Two British ships and one Greek have been in collision with thewreck of the Danish tanker Canada which was mined off the Humber on the3rd November. S.S. Dryburgh (1,290 tons) bound from Leith to Antwerp withcoal ran on the wreck on the 11th November, and although she was towed clearshe was badly holed and sank. S.S. Fireqlow (1,261 tons) in ballast for the tyne collided with the wreck on the 12th November but got off and completedher voyage.The Greek S.S. Georgios on passage to Aberdeen from Tunisia struck theCanada on the evening of the 14th November, and her ultimate fate is uncertain.The crews of all three vessels were unharmed. A light has now been placedon the wreckAnti-Submarine Operations.17. Eleven attacks have been carried out on submarines, seven by surface craft and four by aircraft. Five attacks were made in the vicinity of the thames Estuary on the 14th and 15th November. The French destroyer Sirocco.working with French aircraft attacked a submarine to the westward of Gibraltaron the 15th November and claimed successful results. The remaining attackstook place off the Norwegian and Scottish coasts, and the results are not known.It is estimated that, apart from mining operations, there are only two-boats at sea and that for the greater part of the period there have been nonein the Western Approaches.A belated report from S.S. Bradglen, now in dry dock, states that she hita submerged object 20 miles west of St. David&apos;s Head on the 18th October.Two large dents in her plates and traces of U-boat paint around them telltheir own story, and the fact that a submarine had been located in theneighbourhood on that date adds to their significance.The estimated casualties to U-Boats up to the 13th November were: Known sunk......      ............      ... 7Probably sunk       ...      ...      ............ 13Probably seriously damaged       ...      ......... 5Probably slightly damaged        ............ 8Not yet classified   ...      ............... 3Convoys.18. Nineteen convoys, comprising 341 ships have sailed from, or arrivedat, ports of the United Kingdom during the period under review. No ships have been attacked in convoy.Five ships of the northbound convoy from London to the Firth of Forthgrounded off the mouth of the Hcmber in a thick fog on the night of the11th November. Fortunately there was no wind or swell at the time and theywere refloated successfully.The second outward Norwegian convoy arrived safely on the 15th november and a homeward convoy of eleven ships is now on passage.The average daily figure for convoys at sea is again seventeen. The escortforces employed daily average one battleship, two cruisers, three armed merchant cruisers, sixteen destroyers and six escort vessels, besides four French scouts
escorting between Gibraltar and the Western Approaches. It is an encouragingfact that, up to the 14th November, only seven ships actually in Allied convoyshave been sunk by the enemy compared with 3,064 ships which arrived safely.Mining.19. An inshore extension of the Folkestone mine-field has been started,and a mine-field in the Clyde area is being laid.Information has been received that the Germans have not, as yet, laid mines in the extension to their declared area in the Sound.The British India S.S. Sirdhana (7,800 tons) struck a mine on the13th off Singapore, presumably in one of the defensive mine-fields. There were no casualties among the European passengers or crew. No information hasbeen received about Asiatics, though the press report some&apos; casualties among them.German Merchant Shipping.20. The S.S. Leander (990 tons) which had sailed from Vigo the previous day was captured by H.M.S. Isis on the 9th November. She arrived atFalmocth on the 19th November.The German Hamburg-Amerika liner Mecklenburg (7,892 tons), disguisedns tbe Dutch ship Hoogkerk, was intercepted by H.M.S. Delhi in heavy weatheron the 12th.November and scuttled herself. She had last been reported as havingsailed from Pernambuco on the 14th October. The crew of fifty-six was picked up by H.M.S. Delhi.The German Hamburg sud Amerika S.S. Parana (6,038 tons), which leftBuenos Ayres on the 10th October, was intercepted by H.M.S. Newcastle in theDenmark Strait. The crew of fifty-seven, after scuttling the ship and settingher on fire, were taken on board Newcastle, who finally sank her by gunfire.Economic Warfare.21. The tonnage seized by the Contraband Control Authorities this week is only 6,700 tons, about a third of the previous week&apos;s figures. 194 ships were dealt with, of which 79 have been released. Part or the whole of forty-twocargoes have been seized, including  492 in cash.Dutch ships still continue to head the list of those examined, with Norwegiansecond.Between the 6th and the 13th November, ten ships are known to have beentaken to German control bases. These were six Finnish, two Swedish, oneNorwegian and one Latvian ship; totalling 25,102 tons. These figures cannotbe regarded as complete.Additions to the Merchant Nary.22. In the first two months of the War twelve new ships of a total grosstonnage of 92.000 were added to our Merchant Fleet, and up to the 5th November,a further three ships of a total 21,000 gross tons were completed. New tonnageunder construction is 769,000 and represents 135 vessels.Losses of the French Merchant Nary.23. Up to the 12th November seven vessels of a total tonnage of 48,000 havebeen lost, whilst two enemy cargo ships of 10,000 total gross tonnage have been captured.The total French ocean-going tonnage is 2,802,000 gross, representing668 vessels.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.Operations.24. At the beginning of the week the Germans were active in the Rhine-Moselle sector, where they carried out numerous local attacks and patrols,particularly in the Warndt Forest, the Ohrenthal salient and the Vosges.During the night of the 9th-lOth November they occupied the village of Apachin the Moselle Valley, only to evacuate it next day. On the 11th November,[20333] b 3
after several fruitless attempts, they succeeded in occupying the village ofLiederschiedt, on the south-eastern face of the Ohrenthal salient, and some high ground to the west of it. During the latter part of the week, however, they limitedtheir activity in this sector to work on defences, obstacles and mines.The Rhine front has been quiet throughout the week;- the Germanscontinuing work on their fortifications.Enemy movements.25. The area near the Dutch and Belgian frontiers, and especially theformer, has again been the main centre of interest.Numerous reports have been received indicating that considerable numbersof troops of all arms, including heavy artillery and mechanised units, have been moved into the frontier area between Bocholt and Aachen. On the other hand,identifications tend to show that the increase in troops has not been more than four divisions. Troop movement in this area may, therefore, have been deliberately carried out with the object of confusing foreign observers and givingthe impression that an immediate offensive against the Low Countries was intended.26. Large quantities of pontoon bridging material appear to have been movedup recently into the Lower Rhine area. This would account for the mushroomarowth of nine temporary bridges across the Rhine between Cologne and thepoint where the river enters Hollano. In addition to pontoon bridging material,large consignments of pneumatic rafts are said to have been sent to the dutch frontier opposite Roekmonu.German Invasion of the Low Countries.27. During, the weekend of the 11th and 12th November it appeared thatthe Germans might invade Holland or Belgium. While the military situationremains unaltered, the fact that no attack has yet taken place may be due to: (o) the German General Staff taking military measures in anticipation ofthe possible receipt of orders to proceed with the invasion; or(i) the measures being taken as a bluff, or as a cover for some other, as yetundisclosed, intention of the German High Command; or(c) differences of opinion within the German High Command as to the advisability of invading a neutral State and thereby still furtheralienating world opinion against Germany.Soviet Russia.28. No events of military importance have taken place during the week,and the suspension of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations does not appear to have caused any increased activity on the Finnish frontier. There are some indica-tions that Russian forces in the Baltic States have been slightly reinforced. Afurther report, of unknown reliability, states that Soviet troops in Poland arefortifying the new Soviet-German frontier and constructing defences roundLwow (Lemberg).Finland.29. The Soviet-Finnish talks have been suspended. The Finns appeardetermined not to make any concession prejudicial to their neutrality or indepen-dence. Possibly the negotiations will be carried on through normal diplomatic channels, but the Soviet. Government may procrastinate m the hope that the prolongation of emergency precautions through the winter will prove too great a strain for the finances of Finland and the morale of her people. At present the finns show no signs of weakening. Foreign journalists who visited theKarelian Isthmus at the end of October were impressed by the efficiency of theFinnish defences and dispositions. The maze of lakes and forests is interlacedwith granite anti-tank obstacles. Troops, headquarters and stores are housedm huts made on the spot from pine logs and carefully screened with boughs. an american press photographer with experience in Spain and Abyssinia said heDad never seen anything so good as the camouflaging of the Finnish batteries.
Italy.30. There are indications that the Army in Italy perhaps as a result ofthe recent changes in the higher, command is settling down for the winter tocomplete its re-organisation and improve its training. It may consequently beexpected that, except for the essential frontier garrisons, the bulk of the troops will return to their normal peace stations, where better facilities exist for wintertraining.Overseas garrisons appear to be little short of war strength, but theMetropolitan Forces may have been further reduced for reasons of economy andin view of the ease with which-reservists can be recalled. The requirements of economy and continued training are conflicting, and it is difficult to assess thetotal of men under arms, but it seems unlikelv that the strength of the army has yet fallen as low as 1,000,000.Reports from independent sources continue to mention activity in fortifyingthe Brenner. It will, however, be difficult for the Italians to progress with these works during the winter.There have been recent reductions, totalling about 10,000 white troops, in thestrength of the Libyan garrison, which is now below war establishment. Therehave been no changes worthy of note in other Italian overseas possessions.The Balkans and Turkey.31. The reduction of the number of troops in Turkish Thrace is now dueto commence. In anticipation of this reduction, the Bulgarian authorities haveordered a reduction in the number of their troops maintained on the Turkishfrontier. These reductions on the common frontier will not necessarily result ina corresponding decrease in the strength of the respective armies, as the personnelwithdrawn from the frontier may continue training in the interior.A reduction in Yugoslav effectives from 600,000 to 300,000 has now takenplace and reserve formations have been disbanded.Elsewhere in the Balkans the situation is unchanged.Far East.Military Operations.32. According to a Tokyo official announcement, the Japanese landed atPakhoi on the morning of the 15th November. This operation has long been contemplated. Its primary purpose is to stop the flow of imports and exportsthrough those South China harbours which the Japanese naval blockade has failed to close. In addition, it provides a jumping-off place for operations againstroad communications with Indo-China and a further victory for propaganda usein Japan and for influencing waverers among the Chinese to side with thesecessionist central government which the Japanese military leaders are anxiousto set up. No details of the operation have been received, except that the Japaneseclaim to be pressing their advance inland. - .Withdrawal of British and French Garrisons from North China.33. On the 13th November the British Ambassador in Tokyo informed theJapanese Government officially of our intention to withdraw the bulk of our forces from North China. Tlie French Ambassador made a similar notificationat the same time and our local commanders in China informed the Japanesecommanders at Tientsin and Shanghai. The Japanese commander at Tientsinexpressed himself ready to co-operate in all matters connected with the with-drawal, and it is hoped that the movement of the company going in replacementfrom Shanghai will take place without incident. The Japanese Press gave afavourable reception to the news.Close co-operation with the French is being carried out throughout thewithdrawal and the Commander-in-Chief, China Station, is making arrangementsfor shipping for both French and English.34. A token force to maintain British rights under the Boxer Protocol*of 1901 will remain in Tientsin, with a detachment at Peking. A similar token* Note._International garrisons have, by Treaty, been maintained in North China since1901, for the protection of the Legations and Embassies at Peking and to keep open commnni-cntions with the sea. Following the Great War the only countries who retained troops in north China were Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the United States.
force of French troops will also remain in North China. Signatories of theBoxer Protocol have been informed.Russo-Japanese relations.35. Reports have been received that Japan is flirting with the idea of afull rapprochement with Soviet Russia. Some accommodation in their mutualattitudes is possible; a truce in Manchuria would enable Russia to pay more attention to events in the West and Japan to concentrate on a settlement ofthe China affair. But a complete volte-fate in Russo-Japanese relations suchas that recently carried out by Germany in her attitude towards the Sovietseems unlikely.Japanese interest in the European situation.36. Various reports have been received of the keen interest which japan is taking in the European situation. The preoccupation of the Western Powersmust, in Japanese eyes, provide an admirable opportunity for Japan to proceedwith her plans in China with little chance of interference. Moreover, Japanreaped considerable economic benefit from the last war and probably hopes to gain from the present conflict. Some reports have been received that theJapanese are looking further afield. Articles have appeared in the Japanesepress stressing the oil facilities which exist in the Netherlands East Indies.The preoccupation of Holland with affairs in Europe-particularly if germany should violate Holland would obviously facilitate Japanese action. This isa potential threat which the Dutch have in mind to such an extent that localleave for the armed forces in the Netherlands East Indies has been cancelled.Antarctic.37. Arrangements have been made to afford local protection for the whale-catching industry at South Georgia, an island east of the Falkand Islands and near the Antarctic. This industry has been taken over by the Ministry of food and is a most important source of whale oil.AIR SITUATION.German Air Force Activity.Bombers.38. There has been little activity in the German bomber force during thepast week. A bomber unit, believed to be a new one, has been identified nearFrankfurt, and a bomber wing, formerly in Austria, has been identified atCrailsheim, 40 miles north-east of Stuttgart. In addition, a dive bomber wingappears to have moved from Graz in Austria to the Mannheim area. Thesemoves represent a small increase in the strength of the German bomber forcein the west.Training by Bomber Formations.- 39. A bomber formation, the third to undertake this form of training,has moved to the Baltic, where it is carrying out bombing exercises againstmoving targets. This activity tends to confirm reports from other sources thatGermany proposes to extend her attacks against the British Fleet and british shipping.Coastal Squadrons.40. There was an increase in German reconnaissance flights over the north sea during the week. Owing to the exceptionally bad weather, the reconnaissance aircraft probably achieved little and only one bombing attack took place, on the13th November, when four German aircraft attacked aircraft and ships anchoredin the Shetlands.  Twenty bombs were dropped without result.Germ-an aircraft in Holland.41. Reports have been received, but have not been confirmed, of the arrivalm Holland of fifteen to twenty German aircraft, the majority of which, it was
&apos; &quot; &apos;   * -.:   &apos; &apos; &apos;stated, had been flown by deserters. This report is probably a distorted version of the presence of some German aircraft which lost their way and landed in holland and of the presence of German crews rescued from the North Sea. Fromthe attitude of German pilots who have been brought down in this country itappears most unlikely that there would be any deliberate desertion from theGerman Air Force at this stage.French and German Air Operations on the Western Front.42. Although bad weather has from time to time interfered with flying,air activity has been greater than in the last few weeks and the German AirForce have undertaken several reconnaissance flights over France.On the 7th November French reconnaissance flights were made over theMoselle and Saar areas by day, and also on the following night over theLahn Valley and the Rhine up to Cologne. One D.0.17 (twin-enginereconnaissance aircraft) has been snot down by the French.No reconnaissances were attempted by the French. on the 8th November,but on the 9th a number of missions were carried out over the Rhine and BlackForest where they encountered much A.A. fire.Bad weather again prevented French reconnaissances on the 10th, 11th and12th November. Strong fighter patrols on the 12th and 14th encountered no enemy aircraft. There was, again owing to bad weather, very reduced activityfrom the 12th to the 14th inclusive.43. During the days when flying conditions allowed, enemy reconnaissance aircraft flew widely over the interior of France as well as over the army zones,causing raid alarms in the Paris region, the Seine Inferieure, and the north-eastand centre. Some pamphlets were dropped. Although French AA. guns havebeen active, no enemy casualties have been claimed as a result of A.A. fire.From a study of papers and photographs captured from an enemy aircraft shot down on the 2nd November it is clear that the enemy is paying particular Cattention to the rnnonnnjggaTirp nf aerodromes in ^North-Eastern France. On /several occasions recently German reconnaissance aircraft iiavu flUWll Bollie overBelgium. This has led to a protest by the Belgian Government, but it is too early to say whether it has had any effect. In the meantime the French AirForce authorities are asking for permission to follow German aircraft, whichcross into Belgium with the object of escaping from their pursuers.Royal Air Force Operations.Operations in France.44. The squadrons of the two army co-operation wings have continued tophotograph the area of the British Expeditionary Force and to report oncamouflage work. When the weather, which has been generally unfavourable,permitted, single aircraft reconnaissances have photographed tbe Siegfried line and the enemy back areas.45. Fighter aircraft have carried out a total of sixty-three patrols in theweek, but have encountered no enemy aircraft. One Hurricane made a forcedlanding in Belgium and two others are missing.&quot;M&quot; Balloon Unit.46. The &quot; M &quot; Balloon leaflet-dropping unit has operated on four nightsduring the week, and a total of 158 balloons, each carrying 3,000 leaflets, havebeen released. The winds, blowing mainly from the south-west, have been favourable for this type of operation and it is estimated that the area coveredhas extended to the approximate line Magdeburg-Wittenburg-Dresden-Gorlitz-Hirschberg; it is possible therefore that some of the leaflets have beenscattered over parts of the &quot; protectorate &quot; of Bohemia.Bomber Operations over the North Sea.47. On the 9th a striking force of six Wellington bomber aircraft conducteda sweep up to the Ems estuary to attack any enemy surface forces located. no enemy vessels were sighted.  On the 11th, as a result of a report indicating the
force of French troops will also remain in North China. Signatories of theBoxer Protocol have Deen informed. .Russo-Japanese relations.35. Reports have been received that Japan is flirting with the idea of afull rapprochement with Soviet Russia. Some accommodation in their mutualattitudes is possible; a truce in Manchuria would enable Russia to pay more attention to events in the West and Japan to concentrate on a settlement ofthe China affair. But a complete volte-face in Russo-Japanese relations suchas that recently carried out by Germany in her attitude towards the Sovietseems unlikely.Japanese interest in the European situation.36.

Strong fighter patrols on the 12th and 14th encountered no enemy aircraft. There was, again owing to bad weather, very reduced activityfrom the 12th to the 14th inclusive.43.   During the days when flying conditions allowed, enemy reconnaissance aircraft flew widely over the interior of France as well as over the army zones,causing raid alarms in the Paris region, the Seine Inferieure, and the north-eastand centre.  Some pamphlets were dropped.  Although French A.A. guns havebeen active, no enemy casualties have been claimed as a result of A.A. fire.From a study of papers and photographs captured from an enemy aircraft shot ^down on the 2nd November it is clear that the enemy is paying particular Cattention to the fewrmniggaTirp nf pprnHrnmes in North-Eastern France.   On  /several occasions recently German reconnaissance aircrairriiave flinfll hoilhrover ^)Belgium.  This has led to a protest by the Belgian Government, but it is too early to say whether it has had any effect.   In the meantime the French AirForce authorities are asking for permission to follow German aircraft, whichcross into Belgium with the object of escaping from their pursuers.Royal Air Force Operations.Operations in France.44. The squadrons of the two army co-operation wings have continued tophotograph the area of the British Expeditionary Force and to report oncamouflage work. When the weather, which has been generally unfavourable,permitted, single aircraft reconnaissances have photographed the Siegfried line and the enemy back areas.45. Fighter aircraft have carried out a total of sixty-three patrols in theweek, but have encountered no enemy aircraft. One Hurricane made a forcedlanding in Belgium and two others are missing.&quot; M &quot; Balloon Unit.46. The &quot; M &quot; Balloon leaflet-dropping unit has operated on four nightsduring the week, and a total of 158 balloons, each carrying 3,000 leaflets, havebeen released. The winds, blowing mainly from the south-west, have been favourable for this type of operation and it is estimated that the area coveredhas extended to the approximate line Magdebdrg-Wittenburg-Dresden-Gorlitz-Hirschberg; it is possible therefore that some of the leaflets have beenscattered over parts of the &quot; protectorate &quot; of Bohemia.Bomber Operations over the North Sea.47. On the 9th a striking force of six Wellington bomber aircraft conducteda sweep up to the Ems estuary to attack any enemy surface forces located. no enemy vessels were sighted.

____presence of an enemy force near Heligoland, a bomber reconnaissanceofThree Blenheims was despatched. The flight ran into thick weather and was compelled to fly at 100 feet. After breaking formation to search the reportedposition, the two accompanying aircraft did not rejoin their leader and areml8SA^striking force of four Wellingtons carried out a special search on the15th for a disabled enemy submarine reported proceeding outside territorial waters off the Dutch Coast. No enemy surface forces were found in the area.Bomber Reconnaissance and Leaflet Dropping.48. live Whitley aircraft left this country for a reconnaissance and leafletdropping flight over Southern Germany on the night of the llth-12th November.Four returned to Driffield, but the fifth crashed in France. Enemy searchlightsattempted to locate our aircraft without success. Some A.A. opposition was metnear Mannheim.

A bomb was dropped over the estimated track.On the 12th an aircraft of 224 Squadron attacked a submarine 32 miles S.W.of Lister Light. One of the three bombs dropped secured a direct hit atperiscope depth. Another attack was made on the 13th on a submarine 65 miles .E. of Mtjckle Fltjgga. On the 15th an aircraft detected and bombed a submarine track in shallow water off the North Foreland. In response to theaircraft&apos;s signal, destroyers arrived at the position and attacked with depth charges.Though hampered by bad weather, routine patrols, searches, reconnaissances,convoy escorts and anti-submarine patrols have continued during the week.On the 10th November an offensive patrol of three Coastal Command aircraft was despatched from Thornaby to locate an enemy aircraft 75 miles east ofSpurn Point. They intercepted a Heinkel at this position, but it escaped intocloud. Two aircraft of this patrol were switched to intercept another enemy aircraft 180 miles east of Newcastle.
