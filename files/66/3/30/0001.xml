secret. copy HO.WEEKLY REPORT (NO. 11) OP apr OPERATIONS.AM) INTELLIGENCE FOR THE WEEK EKDMQ MIDNIGHT19TH NOVEMBER. 1939.   ,German Air Force.1. Bombers and Fighters. There has been little activity of the German bomber force during the past week. No changes inthe distribution of the German fighter force have been detected.French Air Force.2.     Bad weather restricted flying during the week:   the few reconnaissance flights made by the French Air Force over theenemy&apos;s lines in the Moselle, Saar, and Rhine, areas failed to disclose any marked activity.3.     Enemy Air Activity.     In spite of the unfavourable weather conditions a considerable number of flights over theinterior of France were made by German aircraft, which on someoccasions violated Belgian territory.     Leaflets have been dropped in Savoy, the Rhone Valley, and in central, southern andsouth western France.     During the past sixteen days no fewer than nine reconnaissance flights by enemy aircraft have been made over the extreme corner of north eastern France, and it isbelieved that particular attention has been directed to Alliedaerodromes.On the night of the 18/19th November a number of enemy aircraft violated Swiss neutrality and entered France in theneighbourhood of Chambery.The nature of the propaganda leaflets dropped by german aircraft during the past week is not yet known, but threeexamples of leaflets dropped earlier have been examined.     One1b made up of four pictures beginning with a British and a french soldier on the edge of a &quot;bath of blood&quot;.   They decide toplunge in, but only the Frenchman carries out his part of the pact;    the Englishman leaves the Frenchman to drown and walksaway laughing.     Another gives a resume* of Heir Hitler&apos;s

recent Reichstag speech emphasising the point that Germany hasno designs on Prance.     The third contains a German version ofMolotov&apos;s recent speech which endeavours to prove that the friendship of Russia and Germany is firm, and also raises thequestion of colonies.Belgain Air Force.4.     The Belgian Military Air Sorvice now has a squadronequipped with Hawker &quot;Hurricane&quot; fighters:   the first line strength of the service remains in the neighbourhood of 200aircraft.ROYAL AIR FORCE OPERATIONS.Bomber Commando5.     Operations against the German Fleet.   The striking force which has been standing by to attack units of the german fleet if any such should be reported in the North Sea has notbeen called upon for operations:    on two days, however.  &apos;sweeps&apos;were made, but they encountered no enemy ships.6.     Reconnaissances of German naval bases.     At therequest of the Admiralty reconnaissances were made of the naval bases at Heligoland and WLThelEishaven on the 17th November.     FourBlenheims were engaged., one of which reconnoitred Heligoland whilethe other three proceeded in formation to Vdhelmshaven.     Theaircraft flew at 20,000&apos;, from which height good photographswere obtained;.     Those taken of Heligoland revealed no vessels of importance, but at wilhelachaven and in the Schillig Roads therewere three capital ships, one cruiser, two submarines, and several small craft.     Two of the capital ships were of the Scharnhorst orGneisenau Class, and the third, located in the fitting-out basin,was probably the 35,000 ton battleship &apos;Von Tirpitz&apos;, launchedabout three months before the outbreak of war.     The Blenheimwhich reconnoitred Heligoland met with no opposition, but thethree Blenheims over Wilhelmsaaven. were fired at, and the firstburst exploded in the middle of the formation in which the

2q**3-aircraft were flying at intervals of 60 yards. No damagowas Buffered ay the Blenheims and all four returned safelyafter a flight lasting about five hours.Fighter Command.7*     Enemy Aircraft.     Enemy aeroplanes, of Junkers 86type,- dropped bombs in the ShetlandB on the 13th November.They were heavily engaged by anti-aircraft fire from cruisers and auxiliaries, and the bombs, eight of which are reported tohave fallen on land and eight in the sea, caused no casualties and negligible damage.Hostile aircraft were reported as flying overLiverpool, Manchester and Coventry on the 17th November:   ithas not, however, yet been established beyond doubt that theaircraft were in fact hostile.A number of unidentified aircraft were reported overthe North Sea during the week, and they called into operationsome 79 patrols involving 257 aircraft of the Fighter Command.The only engagement which resulted from these patrols tookplace on the 13th November when a Dornier 18 flying-boat washunted among the clouds off the East Coast.     Many bursts of fire were directed against the flying-boat which was lastseen, apparently in difficulties, low down near the water: itis known that the Dornier subsequently came down on the seaabout 2h miles east of Felixstowe, but it is not known whetherit sank or moved off again.At 80h2 p.mo on the evening of the 18th Novemberthree or more aircraft were reported approaching FeLixstowe at10,000 feet, bu.t they apparently turned away in a north-easterly direction when they had come within five miles of thecoast.     The visibility at the time &quot;was poor, with some rain,and no fighters were sent out to investigate.

flnastal Command. -8.    Routine patrols, anti-submarine patrolsr-seaxchasj^reconnaissances, and convoy escorts have boon maintained during the week, although restricted to some extent by bad weather.     Pour offensive patrols were undertaken in the north sea with the object of locating and destroying enemy.aircraft;three of these patrols were made by Hudsons and the other bythe Blenheim Plight recently formed in the Command.     Inaddition, the Herring Pishing Fleet has been given protectionby aircraft daily.These activities have resulted in the sighting of twosubmarines, some mines, and numerous neutral merchant vessels.One of the enemy submarines was sighted north eaBt of the shetlands and was attacked with two 250 lb. bombs, but noresults were observed.     The second submarine was sighted and attacked off Cape Wrath;   two 100 lb. bombs were dropped, but nohits were estimated.     On another occasion an aircraft, onconvoy escort near the North Foreland, dropped two bombs on atrail which was slowly moving and was thought to indicate asubmerged submarine.      Two destroyers later arrived on the scene and attacked the suspected U-boat with depth charges.Twenty four convoys, one cruiser and three armed merchant cruisers have been provided with air escort, which hasinvolved the employment of 125 aircraft.. .&quot;.M&quot; Balloon (Leaflet-dropping) Unit.9. Balloons were released by &quot;M&quot; Unit in France on one night during the week when 35 balloons were despatched with atotal of 105,000 leaflets.Reliable information has been received that leafletsdropped from a balloon on the 8th November fell in the neigh-bourhood ofChemmitz and of Dresden, representing a penetration of some 350 miles.

Advanced Air Striking Force.10.   Bad weather curtailed flying during tho week, andthere were no more than ten patrols &quot;by fighters:   noencounters resulted.Arrangements continue in being by which the squadrons of the Second Echelon will be able to move to Francewithin fourteen days of a decision being taken.Royal Air Force Component of the British Expeditionary Force.11 *   Army Co-operation.     Two Army Co-operation squadrons,Nos. 53 and 59, formerly in Nos. 50 and 51 Wings respectively,have been temporarily formed into No.52(A.C.) Wing.     Ihothree Wings have continued their photography of the british expeditionary Force area.12.   Fighters.     The two fighter squadrons, No.s 607 and615, which, as referred to in the Tenth Weekly Report, werestanding by ready to fly to France, went across on the 15thNovember and are now established at Merville as No.61 (F) Wing.Daily patrols have been made by fighters from No.60(F) Wing, but there was no more than one indeterminateengagement, on November 17th.On the 13th three Hurricane Fighters miscalculatedtheir position after a patrol over the clouds, and two ofthem were eventually forced to land in Belgium on account of shortage of petrol:    the pilots, unhurt, have been interned.13.   Bombers.     Photographic and visual reconnaissance ofthe Siegfried Lino and of North West Germany was undei-taken by two Blenheims of No.70(b) Wing on the 16th November.     One ofthe pilots returned to England and reported heavy traffic onthe Rhine, but no unusual road or rail movements.     Thesecond Blenheim did not come back, and it would appear thatthis aeroplane was the one reported by the Air Attache&apos;,
