naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Allied warships have carried out bombardments in support of the armies in Normandy.Allied destroyers have inflicted casualties on enemy destroyers and mine-sweepers in the Channel, and light craft have successfully attacked patrol craftoff the Dutch coast.A U.S. Task Force has carried out successful operations against the MarianaIslands.Shipping losses in May were the lowest since the beginning of the war.Five U-boats have been sunk, three probably sunk and three possibly sunk.Home Waters.2. On the night of the 9th/10th, five M.T.Bs. attacked enemy patrol craftoff the Dutch coast and sank four of them; one M.T.B. was lost. On the following-night five Norwegian M.T.Bs. torpedoed a large trawler in the same area; Unemployment.T.B. was damaged.3. The build-up of our forces in Normandy was at first hampered to someextent by unfavourable weather. Bombing and occasional shellfire also delayeddeliveries during the first phase of the operation, but by the 9th, the steadyenlargement of the bridgeheads had combined with an improvement in the weather to allow of the unloading of troops, stores and equipment at a satisfactoryrate. The small port of Courseulles was soon in use by barges and minor landing-craft, and on the 9th 540 tons were discharged there. The harbour at Port-en-Bessin may be used by coasters of up to twelve foot in draught. The port ofOuistreham is also being prepared for use by our craft. The following figuresrepresent the cumulative totals unloaded in both British and U.S. sectors upto p.m. on the 13th. British : 238.910 men, 35.987 vehicles. 61,202 tons of stores.U.S. : 188,304 men, 26,251 vehicles, 43,973 tons of stores. The laying of cross-Channel communication cables was nearly completed on the 10th.Three &quot;German tank landing craft were captured at Port-en-Bessin and a fourth at Isigny. Up to the evening of the 13th, 9,933 German prisoners hadbeen evacuated to England.4. Naval bombardments have played an important part in covering theAllied landing in Normandy. By the 9th, bombardment forces were assisting tosupport the troops holding the front to the east of the Orne and the Caen canal.In many cases spotting was carried out by forward observer parties, among whomcasualties were heavy. On the 10th, H.M. cruisers Orion and Argonaut carriedout a successful long-range bombardment of Tilly-sur-Seulles and during the afternoon a heavy battery which had hindered unloading on one of the U.S.beaches was silenced by naval gunfire. Allied warships have since continued togive deep supporting fire in the centre and close support on the flanks of ourarmies. On the 13th heavy ships were concentrated off the Vire estuary to meetpossible enemy counter attacks against Carentan. H.M.S. Nelson bombardedNoyers at 34,000 yards range and on the following day she engaged batteries atHoulgate and H.M.S. Ramillies bombarded the docks at Cabourg. Early on the14th, a feint landing was carried out off CaboUrg and H.M. cruiser Scyllabombarded the area. - The U.S. battleships Texas and Nevada and the Polishcruiser Dragon were among, the ships included in the bombarding forces.5. On the flanks of the assault area Allied destroyer patrols have had twoconclusive encounters with the enemy. On the night of the 8th/9th H.M.destroyers Tartar, A shanti, Javelin and Eskimo, the Canadian destroyers Haidaand Huron with the Polish destroyers Piorun and Blyskawica encountered four enemy destroyers, previously sighted by aircraft off Brest, north-west of thelie de Batz. In a confused close range action A shanti torpedoed and sank onedestroyer, and the two Canadian destroyers forced another ashore and left heron fire. Later, Coastal Command aircraft further damaged the strandeddestroyer and again set her on fire. The other two enemy destroyers are con-sidered to have been damaged. Tartar was damaged and sustained four fatalcasualties. Two German destroyers are now left at Brest. On the night of the13th/14th A shanti and Piorun off the Channel Islands engaged and sank twoout of seven enemy minesweepers; two others were left damaged and on fire.6. Enemy E-boat forces have operated at night against Allied shipping in the assault area.    On the night of the 7th/8th, one large infantry landing
craft was sunk without loss and one empty tank landing craft was also sunk.On the following night two tank landing ships and one tank landing craft were sunk and another T.L.C. was seriously damaged. ELM. destroyer Beagle rescuedsurvivors and escorts of a troop convoy drove off the E-boats. Enemy tanklanding craft off the lie St. Marcouf were driven off by destroyer patrols. Onthe night of the 9th/10th, two coasters were torpedoed and sunk north of the assault area; one E-boat was probably sunk and&apos; others were damaged. On thefollowing night H.M. ships Wensleydale (destroyer) and Trollope (frigate) droveoff two groups off Havre. H.M. frigate Hoisted, was torpedoed and two tugswere sunk. H.M. frigate Duff sank one E-boat and damaged others. M.T.Bs.sank an E-boat off Havre and damaged two others. One M.T.B. was lost. Onthe night of the 11th/12th H.M. destroyer Melbreak probably sank an E-boat off Cap d&apos;Antife.r and forced others to withdraw. The U.S. destroyer Nelsonwas torpedoed on the 12th and had her stern blown off. On the following nightH.M. destroyer Boadicea blew up and sank off Portland Bill after being hit by two torpedoes from an aircraft. On the night of the 13th/14th H.M. frigateDiixff set an enemy minesweeper on fire off Cap de la Hague.7. Allied casualties, in addition to those reported above and exclusive of landing craft, are as follows : H.M.S. Peterhead (danlayer), H.M.S. Law ford(HQ. ship) sunk on the 8th. U.S. destroyers Rich, Meredith and Glennonseriously damaged by mines; Rich subsequently sank. H.M.S. Minster (net-layer) mined and sunk. On the 10th, the U.S. Charles Morgan (7,244 tons) was seriously damaged by enemy air attack in the assault area. On the 12th, the tanker British Engineer (6,993 tons) was slightly damaged by a mine and on thenext day the s.s. The Viceroy (824 tons) was damaged by a mine. H.M.S.War spite was mined off Harwich on the 13th, but was able to reach Rosyth under her own power.Mediterranean.8. On the 9th, H.M. S/M Untiring on patrol off the south coast of Franceprobably sank a submarine chaser and sank another on the following day.Coastal forces sank an F-lighter south of Leghorn on the night of the 10th/11th.A port party was established at Civita Vecchia on the 9th: the quays are reportedto have been blown up and the harbour area badly damaged. During an air raidon Anzio on the night of the 9/10th, a U.S. destroyer and minelayer with twolanding craft were damaged.9. In the Adriatic H.M. destroyers Tumult and Txiscan bombarded LussinPiccolo Island on two nights of the week. Coastal forces sank an R-boat and damaged an I-boat on the night of the 9th/10th and two nights later H.M.destroyers Blackmore and Eggesford sank an E-boat off the Dalmatian coast.10. On the 9th H.M. S/M Vivid probably sank the German-controlleds.s. Tanais (1,545 tons) north of Crete. Coastal forces captured two caiques inthe iEgean during the week.Pacific.Mariana Islands.11. Between the 11th and 13th, a U.S. Task Force carried out operations against four islands in the Mariana group. It is reported that 13 ships were sunk and that carrier-borne aircraft which took part in the attack assisted inthe destruction of 141 enemy aircraft. Sixteen other enemy ships including three destroyers and destroyer escorts were serious damaged, and it is statedthat one destroyer and three corvettes were among those sunk on the 11th, when a number of ships attempted to escape from Saipan. On the 12th and 13ththe islands of Saipan and palestinian were bombarded by battleships and cruisers.Celebes.12. On the 13th, a U.S. submarine sighted four enemy battleships, sixaircraft carriers with aircraft on deck, eight cruisers and a number of destroyerspassing northward through the Sibutu passage into the Sulu Sea.New Guinea.13. On the night of the 8th/9th Allied cruisers and destroyers which werecovering Biak Island encountered five enemy destroyers and possibly damage done of them in a long-range action. Three U.S. destroyers shelled enemy positions in Maffin Bay.[27657] b
Anti-Submarine Operations.14. Forty-one attacks have been reported during the week, of which 32were by shore-based aircraft, two by carrier-borne aircraft and seven by warships.A large number of these attacks were carried out in the Bay of Biscay and inthe western entrance to the Channel. Two U-boats off Ushant were sunk by aircraft on the 8th and 10th. On the 11th, one was sunk by aircraftnorth-east of the Shetlands, and on the 13th another was sunk by a CanadianGatalina in the same area, US. destroyers operating with the U.S.S. Croaten(escort carrier) sank one north-west of the Azores on the 12th; sixty-one prisoners were taken. On the 7th aircraft probably sank two U-boats in the Bay of Biscayand on the following day aircraft probably sank one off Ushant. Two U-boats were possibly sunk by aircraft in the S.W. Approaches and in the Bay of Biscay,and an escort group possibly sank one in the Channel.Enemy Intelligence.15. The nurnberg is reported to have left Copenhagen southbound onthe 7th.Reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 13th showed the Hipper and Leipzigpresent and one Schlesien battleship off the port. The Prinz Eugen and. Lutzowhad left. At Swinemiinde it was seen that the Admiral Scheer had left sincethe 12th May.U-boats.16. Activity continues in the Bay of Biscay and at the western entrance to the Channel, but there is still no evidence that any U-boat has reached an area east of Cap cle la Hague. There is evidence of up to four U-boats in the vicinity of the Channel Islands and between Guernsey and Start Point.17. Towards the end of 1943 the U-boat building and technical programme was drastically revised in order that the U-boat offensive could be successfullyrenewed by the autumn of 1944 with a reconstituted and retrained U-boat fleet.This policy includes the serial production of two new types of U-boats : one ofthese is the ocean-going 245-foot prefabricated type, and the other is a short-range 100-foot type of boat, details of which are uncertain at present. Neithertype is likely to be ready for operational service in any numbers before the autumn of 1944. Both types are believed to have a higher underwater speed than is atpresent attained. Most of the existing U-boat fleet is at present in the Baltic,where they are probably being re-equipped with new anti-detection and protectiondevices.   The building of normal operational types has ceased since February.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. Apart from the shipping losses in the Channel operations, one ship was sunk by U-boat on passage from Takoradi to Freetown. A belated report statesthat a British ship was sunk by U-boat north east of the Chagos Archipelagowhile on passage from Colombo to Fremantle on the 6th.19. Shipping losses by enemy action during May were the lowest on recordand totalled only just over 27,000 tons. Marine casualties amounted to some13,000 tons, making a total of 40,000 tons from all causes, which is also the lowestmonthly figure since the war began. Four ships, totalling over 24,000 tons, were sunk by U-boats. Three ships sailing independently were sunk in the south atlantic and one ship in convoy was lost in the Mediterranean. For the secondconsecutive month no ships were lost by enemy action in the Indian Ocean. two attacks by enemy aircraft were made on convoys in the Mediterranean but onlyone ship was sunk.  There were no casualties from mines or surface craft.Protection of Seaborne Trade.20. During the week ending the 11th, 769 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 285 were in ocean convoys and484 in British coastal convoys. Four escort-carriers (including one U.S. carrier),42 destroyers (including 26 U.S. destroyers) and 61 sioops, cutters, corvettes andfrigates were employed on escort duties. Four home bound convoysconsisting of 170 ships and three outward convoys consisting of 115 ships reached their destinations without loss.
21. During May, apart from Mediterranean convoys, 392 convoys consistingof 6,747 ships arrived at their destinations. One ship in convoy from north russia and a straggler from a convoy from Canada were lost by enemy action.Allied Minelaying.22. Surface craft have laid mines off the north coast of France. aircraft have laid mines in the Heligoland Bight, off the Dutch coast, the north coast ofFrance and the Biscay ports.In the ^aegean aircraft have laid mines off Rhodes and Syros.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.23. During the week E-boats have probably laid mines off the coast ofNormandy and minelaying by aircraft, which is increasing, has been carried out at night off the beaches. Sweeping among the mass of shipping is difficult andthe smoke screens put up make mine spotting ineffective. Minesweepers have completed the clearance for the establishment of all the approach channels andthe area between the two groups of channels is now being swept. Up to date191 mines have been destroyed in the assault area and approach channels. Ninemore mines have been destroyed south of the Isle of Wight.Enemy aircraft w^ere suspected of minelaying in the Thames Estuary and offHarwich on two nights of the week. .24. During recent operations up to the 12th, 89 mines have been destroyed in the Naples and Anzio areas and 33 off Terracina. Forty-two mines were destroyed during the clearance of an approach channel to Civita Vecchia andtwo mines were destroyed in the harbour, where a minesweeper was damaged.Eighteen mines were destroyed during the sweeping of a channel from Anzio.The mine totals are 4,859 ground and 5,022 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.25. It is reported that there has been an increase in the building of Hansaships in Germany wmere five different yards each have one or two under construction.26. The German s.s. Lola (1.193 tons), from the Bosphorus, arrived at chanak and sailed for the -aegean on the 7th, after examination by the Turks.The larger ships in Piraeus are stated to have their crews composed of very mixednationalities with low morale.27. After minelaying by the RAP. on the night of the 11th/12th May, theKiel Canal is reported to have been closed for a week and, after being opened, tohave been closed for a further three days. As this occurred at the peak trafficperiod of the year, the loss to the enemy is estimated at 1,350,000 tons.Russian Intelligence.28. H.M. submarines Sunfish, Unbroken, Unison and Ursula, which were transferred to the Russian Navy on the 30th May, have been re-named Bl, B2,B3 and B4 respectively. H.M.S. Royal Sovereign was transferred on the same day and has been re-named A rkhangelsk (Archangel).MILITARY SITUATION.North-West France.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)29. This week has seen a very satisfactory development of the bridgehead,particularly south and S.W. of Bayeux.In the Cotentin Peninsula, U.S. forces have reached the southern outskirts of Montebourg, crossed the River Merderet and captured Carentan. The originalbridgeheads to the east and west of the Carentan Estuary were joined up onthe 8th.A considerable advance has been made by U.S. forces from their initialbridgehead in the area of St. Laurent and Colleville. Isigny was captured early on the 9th, the bridge over the River Aure at this town being,captured intact,On the British right flank, strong armoured forces were engaged on bothsides, the heaviest fighting taking place around Tilly-sur-Seulles. A successful[27657] b 2
outflanking attack by British armoured forces resulted in the capture of thehigh ground west of Villers-Bocage on the 13th. Fighting in the vicinity ofboth the above towns continues.On the remainder of the British front, intensive and continuous fighting hastaken place north and N.E. of Caen but the front has remained virtuallyunchanged. The 6th Airborne Division has maintained its positions to the east of the River Orne.Our general line on the 14th ran slightly south of Montebourg just west of the River Merderet inclusive Carentan 2 miles south of Isigny Berigny Caumont exclusive Villers Bocage inclusive St. Honorine De Ducy exclusiveTilly-sur-Seulles Putot-en-Bessin Cambes Touffreville Breville FrancevillePlage.The enemy rate of build-up has fallen short of our original estimates; enemyreserves, and in particular Panzer formations, have been committed piecemealto the battle, and so far no major co-ordinated counter-attack has been put in.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)30. Our armies in Italy have maintained their advance north and N.W.of Rome, in face of increased enemy resistance and considerable demolition.31. The enemy&apos;s withdrawal in the Adriatic sector was first reported onthe 8th when our forward patrols found Tollo clear of the enemy. In the succeeding days, Indian forces on the right flank followed Up until they had crossed the Pescara River, secured Pescara and Chieti, and advanced to theRiver Saline, which was reached by the 12th. Inland, Allied forces followed the advance, finding Sulmona and Popoli clear of the enemy. By the 14th, theright coastal flank of the Corps had reached the River Vomano, at a point eightmiles S.W. of Giulianova, and Aquila, on the Popoli-Rieti road, had been foundclear of the enemy.32..&apos; The Eighth Army has been advancing towards a general line Avezzano-Rieti-term -Orvieto. By the 14th, both Orvieto and term  were in our hands,and Dominion forces were advancing north of the Avezzano marshes. The mainthrust, directed at Orvieto and term , was led by two armoured divisions; theright Division fought its way slowly up the Tiber valley until, on the 13th, Narniwas reached after an advance made under enemy shell-fire. The following day the division reached term , where the latest reports speak of the enemy havinglaunched a counter-attack. The left division was held up for some days by strongenemy defensive positions at Bagnoregio. Some hard fighting took place southof this town, but on the 13th our forces attacked and broke through the enemy&apos;spositions, inflicting many casualties and taking a number of prisoners. the advance continued towards Orvieto, which was entered from the S.W. on the14th. Between these two armoured thrusts, and covering the right flank of theOrvieto position, a British infantry division has been fighting its way north, andit too entered Orvieto on the 14th, which it passed through to the north, on theroad which leads up to Lake Trasimeno.33. The Fifth Army has made considerable advances N.W. of Rome fromCivitavecchia up the coast road to Tarquinia and Montalto Di Castro. Inland,U.S. armoured forces advanced up Highway 2 to Vetralla and Viterbo. At thispoint a French corps was passed through the U.S. formations on the right of theArmy flank, and pushed forward towards Lake Bolsena. With one divisiondirected up the east and another up the west shore of the lake, this corps had,by the 14th, straddled the lake and cut the lateral road running from Orvieto toAlbinia. U.S. forces on the coast continued the advance until they were acrossthe Albegna river and up the road to Grosseto to a distance of eight miles north of Albinia. The lateral road from Orvieto westwards is, therefore, completelyin our hands.34. The Fifth Army has now advanced some 80 miles along the coast fromRome, and the Eighth Army, having reached the Orvieto area, has covered 60 milessince the fall of Rome on the 4th.The Russo-German Campaign.Finland.35. On the 9th, the Russians attacked the Finnish positions on the KarelianIsthmus N.W. of Leningrad, quickly penetrating the strong defences, which the
Finns have had over two years to construct, and advancing up to 15 miles on a front of 25 miles on the western side of the isthmus. Since this initial success theRussians have continued to make slow progress in difficult country and againstdetermined resistance.Yugoslavia.- 36. The German offensive in Western Bosnia appears to have died down andthe Partisans claim that their counter-attacks are inflicting heavy losses on theenemy in this area.In a strong drive southwards from Pjevlja (60 miles S.E. of Sarajevo)German forces advanced 15 miles and crossed the River Tara. They were,however, pushed back over the river by the Partisans.The Partisans are using three divisions in a full-scale offensive against theGermans in the Majevica hills (immediately north of Tuzla). Up to the 10th,650 casualties had been inflicted on the enemy.The Allied and Partisan forces, which had raided Brae on the 1st, were withdrawn from the Island on the 5th. British and U.S. troops suffered133 casualties and the Partisans 260. The Germans lost 230 in the fighting atthe eastern end of the Island only..Burma.Chin Hills and Chindwin.37. Enemy attacks and our subsequent counter-attacks in the Bishenpur andPalel-Tamu areas have resulted in little material change. The Japanese havemade repeated attacks on our troops 15 miles N.W. of Imphal but without success.Our forces following the Japanese who had been retreating from the vicinity ofKohima are held up ten miles south of Kohima where they are meeting stiffODDOsition.X   A.North Burma.38. Progress has been made by the Chinese/U.S. forces investing Myitkyinaand closing in on Kamaing. British troops under command of this force arenow fighting in the S.E. outskirts of Mogaung.Salween River.39. The Chinese forces west of the Salween River have made further progress.  Chinese troops are within two miles of Lungling.Pacific.40. On Biak Island, the U.S. forces are mopping-up Japanese remnantsin the vicinity of Mokmer airfield. On the 4th, the enemy attacked the U.S.positions on the Aitape perimeter forcing the U.S. troops to withdraw to thewest shore of the Driniumor River. Australian troops have reached Dalua,66 miles N.W. of Alexishafen, without making contact with the enemy.In New Ireland, Allied troops have made unopposed landings on Tingwonand Dyaul Islands.AIR SITUATION.General Review.41. A very heavy scale of effort, involving a record number of sorties, was maintained in support of the land operations in Normandy.Coastal Command aircraft made damaging attacks on E-boats and other small ships, and on a convoy off the Frisian Islands.In Italy, attacks on enemy transport and communications were maintained.Heavy bombers attacked oil refineries in Southern Europe and industrial targets in the Munich area.Mitchells sank four destroyers off Dutch New Guinea.
United Kingdom.42. During daylight one Me. 109 flew over the Hastings/Bexhill area. Onthe night 12th/13th, five enemy aircraft flew over S.E. England, one was destroyedby A.A. and crashed near Barking. On the same night 11 pilotless aircraft were launched against this country; two are believed to have reached the greater london area. These aircraft are launched from a ramp probably using a take-offrocket. The weight of the war head and the blast effect produced are estimated to be comparable with that of the German S.B. 1,000-kg. bomb. The speed isvariously estimated at between 250/300 m.p.h.Home Waters.43. During the week ending midnight on the 14th, aircraft of coastal command flew 1,331 sorties, involving 11,561 flying hours.Off the coasts of France and the Low Countries, night attacks were made onabout 230 small ships, of which some 50 per cent, were E-boats; 56 ships, of which26 were E-boats, were either destroyed or damaged.At dawn on the 15th, 42 escorted Beaufighters (one missing) made an effectiveattack on a convoy off the Frisian Islands; an 8,000-ton ship and a 4,000-ton navalauxiliary were torpedoed and left listing, one minesweeper was sunk, five more were set on fire, and a further two minesweepers together with two E-boats were slightly damaged.Aircraft on sea-mining operations, of which 129 were despatched, laid504 mines; one Halifax crashed in this country.Western Front.44. In a week in which weather conditions have by no means been favourable to flying, the Allied air forces, exclusive of Coastal Command,despatched about 39,000 sorties from bases in the United Kingdom. About18,000 tons of bombs were dropped. This effort was, in the main, aimed at the disruption of the enemy&apos;s attempts to build up his forces against the Cherbourgbridgehead. To this end, the strategic bombing was largely directed againstimportant railway centres and airfields lying on or within the arc bounded byLille/Paris/Orleans/Tours/Nantes, with the tactical forces attacking roads,troop concentrations, M.T., bridges, railways, airfields, &amp;c, in the immediatehinterland of the battle area, and providing the necessary protective cover to theAllied lines of communication and to our forces on land. G.A.F. reaction to this effort was light, only some 3,200 sorties being flown over Northern France duringthe week, and, of these, about 2,200 were by defensive and ground attack aircraft;the offensive sorties operated mostly by night against Allied shipping in the Baiede la Seine. In the week, the Allied losses were 112 heavy bombers, 16 medium and light bombers and 200 fighters and fighter-bombers -less than 1 per cent, ofthe total effort; enemy casualties, both on the ground and in combat, were268 destroyed, 18 probably destroyed and 88 damaged. The distribution of theAllied effort was approximately as follows : Franee *45. (a) Communications, Over 15,700 tons of bombs were dropped on railway centres, towns, bridges, road junctions and de-training points. the night bombing of railway centres, which accounted for about 6,850 tons of thetotal, would appear in the large majority of attacks to have been particularlywell concentrated, the aircraft in many cases operating from below 3,000 feet; themain objectives were at Fougeres, Alencon, Rennes, Mayenne, Pontaubault,Orleans, Etampes, Versailles, Acheres, Dreux, Evreux, Nantes, Tours, Poitiers,Amiens, Arras, St. Pol and in the Paris area. By day, on the 8th, U.S. heavy bombers dropped 1,222 tons in raids on five centres, at Tours, Angers, Paris,St. Nazaire and Rennes respectively. On the night of the 14th/15th, 1,809 tons were dropped in two particularly effective attacks on the port of Havre and, onthe same night, about 720 tons were dropped on the locomotive depot at Douaiand on railway crossings at Cambrai. About 35 bridges were either destroyed or damaged during the week.(b) Troops, M.T., locomotives, &amp;c. One hundred and, seven locomotives, 668railway wagons, 487 M.T., 31 armoured cars, 22 tanks and four trains were destroyed during the week and to these must be added a further 722 units either* The results of some attacks are referred to in Appendix VII.
probably destroyed or damaged.&quot; These losses were caused almost entirely by the 18,500 medium, light and fighter bombers and fighters,which operated onoffensive reconnaissances, fighter patrols and escorts, and in direct support ofthe army on the bridge-head. On the night of the 14th/15th, 1,598 tons were dropped on two concentrations of M.T. and troops to the S.W. of Caen.(c) Airfields. Over 7,000 tons of bombs were dropped in attacks on 67 air-fields extending from Lille to Rennes, the large majority of the tonnage being dropped by U.S. heavy bombers. Night bombers dropped a total of 1,318 tons onLe Mans, Laval and Rennes and on the landing ground at Flers.(d) Coast defences, gun positions and defended localities. These were attacked by about 750 aircraft which dropped some 1,100 tons of bombs.(e) Other targets. Day attacks, mostly on a small scale, were made on twoammunition dumps, a fuel dump, three suspected headquarters one of which,at Littry, was destroyed, oil cisterns at the mouth of the Seine, an Orleans power station which was destroyed, a pier and ferry boat at Cherbourg, both of whichwere set on fire, and the rear echelon of the 21st Panzer division in the ForetGuinbosq.(f) Other night operations. About 450 aircraft, mostly Mosquitoes, operatedas support to bombers and on patrols over the bridge-head area; 48 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of two Mosquitoes and a third which crashed..Germany.46. On the night of the 12th/13th, 276 aircraft dropped 1,440 tons on asynthetic oil plant at Gelsenkirchen; after a somewhat scattered start, a goodconcentration was achieved and many large fires and explosions are reported.Forces of about 35 Mosquitoes, dropping about 50 tons of bombs, made threeattacks on Berlin and one on Gelsenkirchen. A day attack was made by 61Liberators on an oil refinery at Emmerich with good results. From the aboveoperations, 17 Lancasters and four Mosquitoes are missing.Mediterranean Front.47. During the week ended dawn on the 13th, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 13,863 sorties and 9,379 tons of bombs were dropped;130 Allied aircraft were lost and 113 enemy aircraft destroyed.^In Italy, a heavy scale of effort was maintained against enemy communica-tions and transport. Oil refineries in Italy, Yugoslavia, Rumania and Hungarywere attacked by heavy bombers. An ordnance works, aero engine works, and air-fields were bombed in the Munich area; further attacks were made by heavy bombers on railway centres in Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia and at Munich.Fortresses based on Russia attacked an airfield in Rumania.Italy.48. Over the battle 3,1 Gel, cl s far north as Florence, bombers and fighter bombers flew a total of 4,528 sorties; these attacks were very largely concentrated on roads, railways, bridges and M.T. Near Savona., one span of a viaduct wrasdestroyed and a bridge seriously damaged; a viaduct in the Genoa area was rendered impassable and several other viaducts hit. A number of bridges are known to have been destroyed and hits made on many others. Road junctions,roads and railways were heavily attacked; a number of road blocks were causedand railway tracks cut and the lines blocked. Moving traffic on the roads and rail-ways was also effectively attacked; 1,414 M.T. were destroyed and a further 1,148damaged, about 80 horse-drawn vehicles were destroyed and 240 units of rolling-stock destroyed or damaged. Several gun positions were silenced and a number ofuns damaged. At night, similar operations were carried out on a smaller scaley medium and light bombers.In i the Genoa area, 207 heavy bombers attacked docks, shipyards andindustrial areas; a further 52 aircraft bombed the submarine base at Pola(90 miles E.S.E. of Venice). Three attacks were made on the oil storage cisternsat Porto Maghera (N. of Venice), 400 tons were dropped and a number of cisternsdestroyed. The railway centre and oil refineries at Trieste were attacked, 550 tonsbeing dropped with good results.   The railway centres at Mistre, Ancona and* Note.-Weekly figures for the M.A.A.F., on account of changing headquarters may beincomplete. a        x &apos;      J
Faenza were bombed, and at the airfield at Ferrara (N. of Bologna) 279 tons were dropped. At Leghorn, shipping was attacked by medium bombers and two vessels were probably sunk.For the time being at least, all daylight operations by enemy aircraft in thearea of their retreating armies in Italy have ceased, apart from a fewreconnaissance sorties. The available fighters have been withdrawn to northern italy, where they are now employed defensively against Allied day bombing inthat area, and against formations attacking Southern Germany. The german air Force probably appreciate that any forces they might employ in the battle area would have negligible effect in delaying the Allied advance, and the oppor-tunity is probably being taken to rest and refit, until such time as they maysucceed in re-establishing a firmer front. The inability of the enemy fighter and close support forces to meet their present commitments in all theatres isclearly demonstrated, and the armies in the south have had to forgo air support in favour of Western and Russian Fronts.Southern Germany and A ustria.49. Heavy bombers, based on Italy, attacked the railway centre and theindustrial area at Munich and the following targets in this area : the aircraftcomponent factory Neuaubing, the Bayerische motor works, the ordnance works at Milbertshofen, the Allach motor works and the airfield.at Oberhfaffenhofen.On the two days in which these operations were carried out, about 1,800 tons of bombs were dropped with very good results. The railway centre at Innsbruckwas attacked by 24 Liberators. During these operations, including two attacks on Porto Maghera, about 450 enemy fighters were encountered; of these 62 were destroyed for the loss of 38 heavy bombers and six escorting fighters.Yugoslavia and Albania.50. .Oil refineries were attacked at Brod, Smederevo (25 miles S.E. ofBelgrade), Osliek (100 miles NW. of Belgrade) and Caprag (30 miles S.E. ofZagreb); 266 heavy bombers and 40 Wellingtons carried out these operations.The railway centres at Nis and Smederevo were bombed by 70 heavies and 35Wellingtons; at least 110 units of rolling stock were wrecked. Small shipping and the harbours at Corfu and Split were attacked; a number of vessels were either sunk or damaged. Successful attacks were made on trains and M.T., atleast 60 of the latter being destroyed.Rumatfvia and Bulgaria.51. The oil installations at Giurgiu (35 miles S. of Bucharest) and atConstanza were bombed by 391 heavy bombers, which dropped 758 tons of bombs; good results are reported. The airfield at Focsani (100 miles N.N.E. ofBucharest) was attacked by 121 escorted Fortresses based on Russia, and the airfield at Karlovo (33 miles N. of Plovdiv) by ten heavies and 32 Wellingtons.Fifteen heavy bombers and four escorting fighters are missing from, these operations, and 19 enemy fighters were shot clown.Forty-six Lightnings, escorted by a further 41, were despatched to attack the Romana-Americana oil refinery at Ploesti; 37 tons of bombs were dropped.Returning Lightnings destroyed 20 locomotives and 44 M.T.; 22 aircraft are missing from this operation and 23 enemy fighters were shot down.Hungary.52. Oil refineries in the neighbourhood of Budapest were attacked by atotal of 240 heavy bombers and 39 Wellingtons. Many fires and explosions were caused, and photographs show a number of cisterns destroyed and considerable damage. The nitrogen and oil cracking plant at Petfurdo (35 miles S.W. ofBudapest) was bombed by 143 heavies and 247 tons dropped. Four bombers and six escorting fighters are missing from these operations and 17 enemy fighters were shot down. The airfield at Kecskemet (45 miles S.E. of Budapest) was bombed by 26 Lightnings; eight aircraft were destroyed on the ground.aegean.53. Small scale attacks were made on Rhodes and Heraklion harbours, the airfield at Calato and small shipping. Olive oil factories were attacked atNavarino in Greece.
Russia.54. The Russian offensive north of Leningrad caused a revival in close support activity by the Russian Air Force; attacks were largely concentrated on enemy lines of communication and much damage is reported. It is unlikelythat the German Air Force will be able to divert any considerable force in supportof Finnish resistance.Elsewhere the Russian Air Force principally restricted their operations to local activity over those areas where fighting was reported. The activity ofthe German Air Force was largely concentrated in the area north and north-west of Jassy.On two nights, Russian long-range bombers attacked enemy airfields and alarge number of aircraft are claimed to have been destroyed.Burma.55. Allied aircraft, for the week ended the 13th, flew a total of 1,895 sorties;five Allied aircraft are missing and twc enemy aircraft were destroyed.Transport aircraft flew 1,669 sorties, carrying 2,916 tons, 2,519 men. andevacuated 1,071 casualties.The heaviest scale of effort by Allied aircraft was made in the Assam-Chindwin area, where a total of 408 offensive sorties were flown by bombers and fighter-bombers. Numerous attacks were made on the Tiddim road, and on enemy positions, supply dumps and M.T. in the Kohima and Imphal areas.In the Myitkyina area, bombers and fighter-bombers flew a total of 312offensive sorties; supply dumps, enemy positions and railways were effectivelyattacked. In the remaining areas, Allied air activity was on a smaller scale, buta number of important targets were attacked.China Zone.56. On account of deteriorating weather over Burma, a higher scale of effort was maintained. For the five days ended on the 11th, Allied aircraft flew atotal of 528 sorties. A considerable number of small craft carrying troops were attacked on Tungting Lake; at least 400 casualties were caused. Many vessels on the Siang River, in the Changsha area, were either sunk or damaged. In this and the Hankow areas, several towns and a number of railway targets wereeffectively attacked. Heavy bombers attacked Lashio, and enemy positions in theSal ween area were attacked by fighter-bombers.Pacific.New Guinea area.57. In the Schouten Islands area, about 200 Allied aircraft attackedtargets on Biak Island and the airfield on Numfor Island. A similar effort was directed against camps, stores, &amp;c, near Wewak and Aitape.Some successful attacks were made on enemy shipping. Mitchells attacked a force of two light cruisers and five destroyers off the Vogelkop Peninsula,sinking four of the destroyers and damaging the fifth; in the same area, aLiberator damaged a heavy cruiser, Bostons sank two small freighters and seta third on fire, and Mitchells sank a large lugger. In Geelvink Bay, otherMitchells sank four small merchant ships and two luggers.New Britain and Bougainville.58.   About 350 medium, light and fighter bombers attacked supply, areasgun positions, &amp;c, near Rabaul and some 300 aircraft operated against similartargets on Bougainville Island.The Marshall and Caroline Islands.59. About 600 aircraft (8 missing) attacked targets in these groups, themain objectives being Truk, Wotje, Taroa, Mille and Ponape. A large freighter,west of Truk, was probably sunk by a reconnaissance aircraft.An attack by four Liberators on an airfield at Palau in the West Carolinesresulted in the destruction of 22 aircraft on the ground.[27657] c
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.61. The only activity during the week was on the night of the 12th/13thwhen the L.N.E.R. bridge at Grove Road, Bethnal Green, was demolished andsevere blast damage caused by a pilotless aircraft which fell on the bridge. other minor incidents, caused by similar aircraft, occurred at Swanscombe (nearDartford), Cuckfield (Sussex), and Borough Green (near Wrotham).In addition, Maidstone and Folkestone were shelled by cross-Channel guns;extensive damage to property was done in the latter place.Casualties.62. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 14th June,are 9 killed and 23 seriously injured.
