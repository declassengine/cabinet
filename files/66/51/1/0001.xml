THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) .301.1th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.REGISTRATION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTORS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.AT the meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 24th April (W.M. (44) 56thConclusions, Minute 4) I drew attention to difficulties which had arisen in Countyk Registration areas in working the new registration machinery, owing to shortageof staff and the pressure of other urgent work connected with war operations, andin my Memorandum (W.P. (44) 214) I made a proposal for a short amending Billto remove the requirement of the two months&apos; period of residence as a qualification for voting, but putting back the qualifying date by one month. The cabinet approved the proposal in principle and authorised me to discuss it withrepresentatives of the main political parties.A Bill to give effect to the proposal was accordingly drafted, and on the10th May I met representatives of the main political parties and the Party Agents.At this meeting some of the Conservative Members of Parliament expressedreluctance to abandon the requirement of two months&apos; residence, despite the carrying back by one month of the qualifying period, especially in connectionwith a possible general election. They asked for time to consider the matter,and later I was informed that the representatives of the Conservative Party andof the Liberal National Party were unable to agree to the proposed Bill. A copy is appended of the note sent to me by the Conservative representatives givingthe reasons for their disagreement.With a view to mitigating these objections I then proposed that the Billshould be framed on a temporary basis and should provide that the Secretaryof State be required to make an Order fixing a date for the expiration of the amending Act as soon as he is satisfied that the clerical difficulties can be met and that in any case it should come to an end on the 31st December, 1945, unlessits life were extended by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament.This proposal was put before representatives of the Conservative Party butthey said that it would not remove their objections. They contended that therewas no evidence that the 1943 Act could not be worked in the boroughs, and thatthe counties ought to find a way of overcoming difficulties which the boroughs donot find insuperable. They urged that the number of additional clerical workersrequired would not be so large as to cause serious interference with the war effort,and that an important political principle ought not to be abandoned &quot;because of clerical difficulties. ;In these circumstances I felt that before pressing for legislation it wasnecessary to hold further consultations both with the Electoral - registration officers and with the Ministry of Xabour. The results Of these consultations areas follows :- 11. They confirm my previous view that there is no way of simplifying the clerical processes withinthe framework of the existing Act and that the only wayof reducing the volume and complexity of the clerical work is the plan which Ihave put before the Cabinet.. , ^    . ^^^v .&apos;&apos;;^. ,2. Unless there is amending legislation a considerable volume of additionalclerical assistance must be found for Electoral Registration Officers. The numberof additional workers required in any one constituency may usually hot exceedthree, but in the aggregate it is estimated that there-will be needed about 1,200clerical assistants to do the routine work under supervision, and about 400persons competent to instruct and supervise.   The Ministry of Labour say that
to find these additional workers at numerous places up and down the country will not be easy at the present time, and that in any case they can only be foundif the work is given high priority.3. So far as can be ascertained the difficulties in the boroughs are not so great as in the counties. In the larger boroughs at any rate there appear to bestill available officers with some experience of registration work who can instructand supervise clerical assistants. The risk, however, cannot be overlooked thatin some of the boroughs there may be failures, and a failure in one place is liableto have a widespread effect in other places, because the whole system depends ona proper notification of removals from one constituency to another. And any failure in official machinery for the conduct of elections is a very serious matter.4. In many of the counties the Clerk of the Peace has now no officialexperienced in registration work to assist him, and accordingly, even if additionalclerical assistance were provided, the Clerk would still be confronted withthe difficulty of finding anyone with the necessary knowledge and experience toensure that the work is being properly done. If and when some suitable super-visor is found, there would be a substantial delay caused by the necessity oftraining him in registration work and the complexities of the new system. Someof the Clerks say that the only way of overcoming these difficulties will be forthem to get back experienced staff who are now with the Forces.5. In both the counties and the boroughs there is a risk that, when an electionis initiated and a register is compiled, there may be many omissions or mistakes,and that as a result there will be a large number of claims and objections. Under,the pre-war system, claims and objections in recent years have been comparativelyfew, and the scheme of the new Act, being based on the assumption that there willbe no large increase in claims and.objections, gives very little time for dealingwith them. If, as a result of the complexity of the new scheme and theinexperience of many of the clerical workers, mistakes are numerous and there arelarge numbers of claims and objections, the work which has to be done between theinitiationof an election and the holding of the poll may be thrown into confusion.6. All the Electoral Registration Officers who have been consulted agree that,if the procedure is simplified as proposed in my amending Bill, the dangers and difficulties of which they are apprehensive will be greatly reduced or eliminated,and though some additional assistance will be required for which priority mustbe given, the aggregate numbers will be comparatively small.7. &quot;Within two or three months from the passing of the new Bill theAppointed Day can be fixed and the new scheme of registration made available forany by-election. In the absence of such legislation it would be necessary to defer the Appointed Day until additional staff has been recruited, trained, and is readyto operate subject to the risks mentioned above the new system.The choice, therefore, is between (a) finding some 1,600 additional workers,facing a long delay and, when at last the appointed Day is fixed, running asubstantial risk that there may be failures in some places and large numbers oferrors in many places, and (b) bringing in amending legislation despite opposition from certain quarters.My own view is that the&apos;opposition is based on an unfounded fear that theprinciple of at least two months&apos; continuous residence may be permanentlyabolished, and on a failure to realise fully the effect of putting back the qualifyingdate. While the amending Bill will abolish temporarily the requirement of continous residence, the putting back of the qualifying date will, nevertheless,have the effect of ensuring that, even in the case of recent removals, the voterwill, as a general rule, have been residing in the constituency for at any rate amonth, and generally longer, before the date at which the election is initiated.I much regret that a proposal which seems to me a harmless simplificationof machinery should cause controversy, but I think the right course for theGovernment is to face the controversy and press forward with the temporary-Bill, a copy of which was circulated with my Memorandum (H.P.C. (44) 38) tothe Legislation Committee of the 5th May.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,-7th June, 1944. &apos;
APPENDIX.The Conservative Members of Parliament and. the Chief Agent of the Party,who had the privilege on Tuesday of conferring with the Rt. Hon. herbert morrison, the Home Secretary, now submit for his consideration the followingunanimous views on the subject which was then discussed : 1. Great importance is attached to the retention of a qualifying period ofnot less than two months mainly because of the necessity of preservingthat enduring association which should exist between the electorsand their representative in Parliament.2. This view is supported by the proposal presented by the Vivian Report,that when a person - removed from one constituency to another heshould remain on the register of the constituency he left until he had completed, two months&apos; residence in his new abode.3. A qualifying period should be a condition precedent to any proposalto use the parliamentary register for local government elections.4. It is understood that the difficulties. which have arisen occur only insome places. It would be much preferable to endeavour to providewhat assistance may be necessary to overcome those difficulties in theareas affected than to adopt the new procedure suggested.5. The necessity for an amending Act so soon after the passing of theprincipal measure is likely to create an unfortunate impression in thecountry, which should be avoided, if possible.(Signed) HUGH 0&apos;NEILL.ARTHUR EVANS.QUINTIN HOGG.GEOFFREY HUTCHINSON.CHARLES MacANDREW.R. MANNINGHAM-BULLER.ROBERT TOPPING.11th May, 1944. &apos;
