I12th June, 1944. &quot; &quot;NfWAR CABINET.TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.I. The Compensation Problem.IT must necessarily sometimes be difficult for Conservatives, Liberals andSocialists to agree about post-war legislation. In Town and Country planning the Socialist and the Liberal will wish to extend State interference with private trade and property much further than most Conservatives will think necessary or desirable. Many Conservatives hold that State planning can easily be carried toa point where it will impede development and impair freedom, without improvinganything. For the sake of avoiding controversy that might delay measures of reconstruction, desired by everyone, I would make many concessions to my Socialistcolleagues, and do not contest the unprecedented powers of land acquisitionembodied in the Bill.&quot; No compromise, however, appears to be legitimate on thequestion of fair compensation to persons dispossessed of their property.Here again there is a deep cleavage between the Conservative and Socialistview. The Socialist view, as I understand it, is that the landowner has donenothing to create the value of his land which is due to the progress of thecommunity, that land always tends to rise in value, and that therefore this&apos;&apos; unearned increment&apos;&apos; should accrue to the State and not to the landowner.The Conservative view, on the other hand, is that the value of land is often dueto the efforts of the owner or his predecessors, and that in sb far as it is not, itdoes not differ from other forms of property such as equities or commodities whichrise and fall in value according to the public demand for them.In considering the terms of a Town and Country Planning Bill, the Conserva-tive will not wish that any landowner should profiteer out of war conditions, buthe will wish to pay a fair price for land compulsoriiy acquired.It appears to me that there are only two defensible bases on which land nowcompulsorily acquired can be assessed for compensation to the owner.1. Its present market value.The State would probably gain as much on the swings of this formula as itlost on the roundabouts, and the principle was applied and accepted in 1939 whenthe Government seized British-owned American securities. In this case, however,it would work most inequitably as between individuals. &apos;The proprietor of a hotelin Gloucester would have to be paid much more than its pre-war value becausewar conditions have created a boom there, whereas a hotel proprietor in Margatewould get much less than the pre-war value of his property Because war conditions have not favoured Margate&apos;s prosperity. There are &quot; Margates&quot; and&quot; Gloucesters &quot; scattered all over England, and we should in fact be capitalisingthe inequalities between the war profiteers and the war casualties.i 2. The 1939 market value.This has the great advantage of eliminating temporary changes in valuecaused by the war, and for that reason I believe it to be the most equitable solution.The formula, however, becomes grossly inequitable and indeed derisory unless the1939 value is related to the post-war cost of replacement which is greatly affectedby the altered value of money.[27638]
Two other solutions have been proposed : -3. The 1939 ceiling.This proposal is clearly unjust. It amounts to &quot; heads I win, tails you lose,&quot;and is as unreasonable as a &quot; 1939 floor&quot; would be. It has been supported on three grounds : (a) &quot; What did Lord Reith say in 1941 ? &quot;Lord Reith said : &quot; The Uthwatt Committee recommend that the compensa-tion payable in public acquisition or control of land should not exceed sums basedon the standard of values at the 31st March, 1939. The Government accept this principle, and legislation to give effect to it will be introduced in due course.The detailed application of the principle requires consideration. Adjustmentsmay be needed to meet particular cases, and the principle must be open to reviewif circumstances arise which make its application inequitable.&quot; (House of LordsRe-port, 17th Jidy, 1941, Columns 851 and 852.)Lord Reith was very properly concerned to prevent land speculation in regardto blitzed areas, but he laid it down that if circumstances arose which made its application inequitable the principle must be open to review. The circumstances that have arisen are the changed economic conditions.(b) Local Authorities are at present able to buy land below its 1939 value.There is no reason why they should not continue to do this so long as the transactions are voluntary. The adoption of a 1939 standard, adjusted to meetthe post-war cost of replacement, would not prevent many of these voluntarytransactions continuing. In the great majority of overspill sites there will becompetition among landowners to sell their land, and many landowners will find it to their advantage to take a lower price in order to obtain a cash payment.(c) Increase in land values is a social evil which must be stopped.  Therefore.   it is right and fair to take 1939 as the line beyond which no further increase shall be tolerated.This is merely begging the question. Conservatives deny the hypothesis, andthey can hardly be expected to agree that what they consider (however mistakenly)to be the fallacies of Socialist economics should be introduced on to the statute book under the guise of war legislation.4. Cost of replacement of buildings, but 1939 value of land.This has been put forward as a compromise, but I do not see how it can be defended, unless^ indeed, it be an accepted principle that landowners are a classapaA and to be treated as Hitler treats the Jews. The basis of civilised societyis equality before the law.II. The Proposals of the Reconstruction Committee.The solution of the problem favoured by the Reconstruction Committee isthe naked 1939 standard cash value. I do not see how this can be regarded in1944 as an honest solution. The essential condition to equity in compulsory acquisition is that the expropriatee should receive the replacement cost of his property: I do not suggest that it would be equitable to calculate this at thepresent high building costs because they are temporary scarcity costs, but thepermanent post-war costs of replacement must be taken into account.Against this it has been argued that compensation on these lines would be resented by two classes of individuals : (i) Those who have bought Saving Certificates during the war and will onlyreceive the cash value of the Saving Certificates when they are repaid.(ii) Men of the one-man business category who have been called up to national Service, and who have suffered severe financial loss thereby.In regard to the first category, it is just muddled thinking to compare the twotransactions. The man who buys a 15s. War Saying Certificate has voluntarilylent 15s. to the Government, and when the Government has repaid him that sumtogether with compound interest it will have discharged its debt to him. Hisposition is exactly the same as the man who has bought  100,000 of War Bonds.Cash will be repaid by cash.In regard to the second category, it has been Common Law since the battle of Hastings and before that the King can call on any man to defend the Realm
and all his subjects&quot; are alike liable in this respect. Sometimes the&apos; financial results may be more serious to the poor man than to the rich man, but I fail tosee how the small business man who has been called up will be appeased byfinding on demobilisation that a large portion of his property has also beenconfiscated. One of the factors to be borne in mind is that many of the fightingtroops are small property owners. There are over 1 million freeholders in GreatBritain.But the proposal of the Reconstruction Committee is not only inequitable,it is also untenable in debate. Faced with the obvious fact that the smallowner-occupier would not be able to reinstate himself on the 1939 cash value,the Bill proposes that an exception shall be made in his case. The small owner-occupier (defined by a quite arbitrary standard) is to receive enough money toreinstate himself. The man who is one degree better off is not, nor is the equallysmall man who owns a shop or workshop. The man, however poor, who has put his savings into some property-owning company will be despoiled as muchas the &apos;&apos; rich &apos;&apos; man. There are infinite gradations of property owners, and i cannot see this illogical and inequitable proposal standing the test of Parlia-mentary examination.Furthermore, the principle of &apos;&apos; cost of reinstatement&apos;&apos; has already been admitted in the War Damage Act. Owners of blitzed property are entitledeither to &quot; cost of works&quot; payment or a &quot; 1939 value&quot; payment. The war damage Commissioners have an escalator clause to meet the case of those who receive a capital value payment for their property, and this can be put intoeffect on the instructions of the Treasury. I understand, however, that 95 percent, of the claims are expected to be on a cost of works basis, which means thecost of reinstating the property at current prices.Under the Town and Country Planning Bill, as at present drafted, all people whose property is bought by local authorities will receive nothing but the 1939cash value for their property. It does not need much imagination for anyonewith Parliamentary experience to foresee the outcry that will be aroused whenthe repercussions of this decision are appreciated by Members7 constituents.We are on the threshold of a great reconstruction era. Liberals,Conservatives and Socialists alike are eager to get on with plans for rebuildinga new and better Britain and a new and better world. The issues raised by theTown and Country Planning Bill are whether this is to be on a basis of honestyas between the State and individuals or not. We can have full and unanimousSocial reform if public opinion is satisfied that equity to individuals has been observed by the State. If, however, people find they are going to be robbed oftheir property they will violently resist.S.Ministry of Economic Warfare, S. W. 1,12th June, 1944.
