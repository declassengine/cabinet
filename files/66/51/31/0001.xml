Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 331.16*A June, 1944.WAR CABINET.FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AVIATION.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.I have already expressed to my colleagues my personal view that the balanceof advantage lies in transferring the responsibility for civil aviation eventually to a Civil Department and, as a matter of convenience and logic, to the Ministryof Yvrar Transport. I need not elaborate the reasons for this view as they arealready fully expressed in existing papers.2. I have also already agreed with the Lord Privy Seal that the transfermight take place six months after the end of the war with Germany, and fromthis I do not wish to depart.3. But I am bound to say that I should not be prepared to accept this addedresponsibility at an earlier date. The demands upon my own time are alreadyextreme. The phases of the war to which we are now committed or upon whichwe are about to engage, throw enormous burdens upon most divisions of myDepartment and upon all its senior officers. There is the utmost difficulty in maintaining the bare minimum of staff necessary to cope with day to day problems.4. I hope, therefore, that the War Cabinet will not wish to go beyond therecommendation made by the Lord Priyy Seal in his memorandum of the 23rd May(W.P. (44) 264). Indeed I regard his later recommendation for immediatetransfer as impracticable.Ministry of War Transport.16th June, 1944[27668]
