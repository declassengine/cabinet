(44) 319.12th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.&apos;&apos; OVERLORD &apos;&apos; SECURITY.Note by the Minister of Production.WITH reference to my note of the 9th June (W.P. (44) 307) I attach afurther note by Sir Findlater Stewart about the duration of the &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos;security restrictions. It will be seen that S.H.A.E.F. now agrees that the bulkof the restrictions should be removed at D + 25 and that, if this is approved,Sir Findlater Stewart proposes to work out the details with the Departmentsconcerned.Great George Street, S.W. 1,12th June, 1944.DURATION OF SPECIAL SECURITY RESTRICTIONS.i.................. . &apos;Note by Sir Findlater Stewart.SINCE I submitted my report of the 6th June, 1944,* about the duration of the &quot; Overlord &quot; Security restrictions other than the diplomatic ban, theposition has been changed materially by two new proposals formulated byS.H.A.E.F.: (a) That the diplomatic ban should remain in full operation until D -i-15(21st June).(.5) That the bulk of the other restrictions, including the visitors&apos; ban,should be lifted ten days later.It may &quot;be that S.H.A.E.F. will wish to retain one or two of the special restric-tions (e.g., the control of communications with Ireland) for a further period.2. The first proposal has been the subject of a. letter from tihe supreme allied Commander to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and I do notcomment on it here. I understand, however, that S.H.A.E.F&apos;s. second proposal,although obviously related to the first particularly from the point of view ofcover, can be dealt with independently; in other words, whatever is decided aboutthe diplomatic ban, it would still be S.H.A.E.F&apos;s. view that the other restrictionscould be removed at D + 25.3. The arguments in my report of the 6th June for reviewing the field asa whole still apply, but new considerations arise in view of the altered timing.* Circulated with the Minister of Production^ note of the 9th June, 1944 (W.P. (44) 307).[27639]&apos;
I would therefore propose to discuss S.H.A.E.F&apos;s. second proposal with all theDepartments affected by the special restrictions, in order to determine (1) Whether the continuation of all the restrictions, other than the diplomaticban, to D 4-25 is accepted by all concerned.(2) What are the particular restrictions which S.H.A.E.F. wish to retainafter D + 25 and whether these are agreed by Departments.In my report of the 8th June I also suggested that certain arrangements whichwere ancillary to the diplomatic ban, which were obviously vexatious, and whichwould be of little value once the ban had ceased to exist, should be relaxed whenthe ban was withdrawn. My recommendation in this respect remains the same,and I suggest that Departments should be authorised to make such relaxationsas from the date on which diplomatic privilege is restored.(Signed) S. F. STEWART.Home Defence Executive, Norfolk House,St. James&apos;s Square, S.W. 1.
