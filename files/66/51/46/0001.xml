TOP SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 346.2Uh June, 1944.VJrt-U A A-j ill i .OPINION IN LIBERATED FRANCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a report on the attitude of the Frenchpopulation in liberated Normandy, which has been prepared for me from first-hand material supplied through Supreme Headquarters, Allied ExpeditionaryForce.A. E.Foreign Office, 2Qth June, 1944.(Top Secret and Very Confidential.)ATTITUDE OF THE CIVIL POPULATION IN LIBERATEDNORMANDY.The following notes have been compiled from reports received from Britishintelligence officers on the Staff of the Supreme Commander, Allied ExpeditionaryForce, and 21 Army Group who have visited the battle zone during the last ten days.Reception of A Hied Troops.2. Taking into account the naturally cold and reserved disposition of theNormans, the troops have received an enthusiastic welcome. The first Britishtroops entering Bayeux were cheered and embraced, flowers were showered on them and a demonstration celebrating the liberation was held three days afterD-Day, at which a British civil affairs officer was tempestuously cheered. Every-where the reception was friendly. Bayeux, it must be remembered, had notsuffered in any degree as the result of military operations, and it might therefore have been expected that a reasonable welcome would have been extended to theBritish troops. The British troops have, however, received a similarly warmwelcome at places which have suffered heavily by being fought through. general de Gaulle noted the absence of rancour at Isigny, which has been heavilybombarded and partly destroyed, the relief of the inhabitants at the departure of the Germans, and their determination that the war could only end in anoutright victory for the Allied cause and the defeat of the German armies infield. This is confirmed by our own reports from Isigny where the inhabitantshad nothing but smiles for the incoming American troops. At Carentan, of whichthree parts are destroyed, the welcome, though tremulous, was none the lesssincere, and the co-operation of the inhabitants who were left was fully extendedto the incoming soldiery. At one village, of which hardy anything at all remained,the Mayor gathered the surviving inhabitants, made a little speech of welcome12409   [27708]Printed for the War Cabinet.

in which he assured our troops that his people bore them no grudge for the damage which had been inflicted, and then called upon the villagers for three cheers forthe Allies, which were given with real fervour.Sniping.3. Not a single shred of evidence has yet been received at S.H.A.E.F. norat 21 Army Group confirming any of the stories about the sniping of our troopsby French women, although full reports have been called for. It has beensuggested by one reliable British officer that these stories may have been deliberately manufactured by the Germans. There have been, and probably stillare, a great many enemy stragglers behind the British and American lines.These are still coming in and giving themselves up. It is thought that thesestragglers may have been sniping and that some of them at any rate have beendressed in women&apos;s clothes. There was an earlier story, apparently wellauthenticated, of a German .woman who was shot while in the act of sniping,but further investigation suggests that this story was, like the rest, unfounded.These stories have caused considerable disquiet among the troops, particularly among the Canadian troops, in whose area rumours of sniping incidents were first prevalent. Every effort is now being made to prevent any repetition of thesemischievous rumours.Todt Labour Organisation.4. There clearly has been and may for a time continue to be trouble overthe Todt Labour Organisation. In the area now in our possession, the TodtLabour Organisation consists of a heterogeneous mob of ruffians among whomthe Russians seem to predominate. These, so it is reported, have been fairlysuccessfully indoctrinated by the Nazis with their own theories, and further hadbeen allowed considerable freedom to roam about the countryside and to commitrobbery and pillage on a petty scale. The inhabitants appear to have argued that if tame Russians behaved like this, what could be expected of the genuinearticle if it should ever appear in Europe, and this argument seems to have hada special appeal for some of the small landowners whose sympathies mightnaturally incline to Petain and Vichy. There is no doubt that these workers have done a lot of mischief, but this mischief seems to have been confined tocertain areas, and it may be hoped that it will soon be eradicated. There has,however, been trouble, according to one United States observer, in the village of Ste. Mere Eglise, which was the Headquarters of the Todt Labour Organisa-tion in the Cotentin, which was heavily punished by bombardment, and of whichthe inhabitants seem to have been hostile to foreigners generally as a result oftheir experiences, and to have expressed themselves a thought freely inconsequence. At all events there was no stupendous welcome for the troops atSte. Mere Eglise, and rumours probably got about that the French did notwelcome the Allies. This will soon clear up, provided rumour-mongering about it is stopped.The Reception of General de Gaulle.5. It should be remembered that the inhabitants of North-West Normandyhad perhaps suffered less from the war than any other people in France. Theyare for the most part prosperous farmers, intensely conservative and roman catholic in a narrow sectarian way. In politics they are apt to describe anyone who disagrees with them as a Communist, and they have never tired of talkingof the iniquities of the &quot;Front Populaire.&quot; It is therefore all the moreinteresting to learn that General de Gaulle received a warm and friendlyreception everywhere. This is the opinion of the intelligence officers who followedhim, who were either eye-witnesses of his visit or who spoke to the inhabitants of the towns and villages to which he went. The reception was certainly nottumultuous, either in Bayeux, or anywhere else, but the Normans are proverbiallyundemonstrative. Photographs which have appeared in the press of his visit toBayeux give an adequate picture of his reception there. The inhabitants came out into the streets to cheer him and there is certainly no doubt that everyonewas glad to see him. Of one village which General de Gaulle did not visit andwhich has not been at. all ravaged by the war, a British intelligence officer who isbi-lingual and has lived long in France, reports that &quot; there is no really furioushatred of the Germans or fervid enthusiasm for General de Gaulle, but the vast majority are in favour of General de Gaulle&apos;s Provisional Government, for want of a better substitute.&quot;   The cure&quot; and the schoolmaster in this village both said
that they were in favour of General de Gaulle, and that the people will want nota dictator but an authoritarian Government after the war to create order. Theonly person in this village against General de Gaulle was, this observer reports,the aged squire, a Royalist and former cavalry officer, who admires Petain, but would like Britain to bring order to France. He had no followers. The sameobserver says that General de Gaulle&apos;s reception was more fervent in Isigny andthe devastated areas than Bayeux, and that in these there were scenes of emotion.The wounded civilians whom General de Gaulle saw in the hospital at Bayeuxare reported as not complaining, but, on the contrary, excusing Allied action as necessary. The resistance groups are reported as being very well satisfied withGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s reception.6. There is attached as an annex to this report an extract from a report byan officer of the British Intelligence Corps on a tour of the Bayeux region forthe purpose of studying French opinion. It throws an interesting light on theattitude of different social types towards General de Gaulle.Annex.Reaction to de Gaulle.The Bayeux Region is predominantly Conservative and Catholic and the roman Catholic Church has great influence. The Bishop of Bayeux, who isone of the most influential persons in the area with the farmers and bourgeoisie,told me : &apos;&apos; We hate the Germans and are anxious for the best possible relationswith the Allies. We insist on complete independence as regards self-government.De Gaulle crystallises the Resistance Forces and has always been a symbol ofhope for oppressed Frenchmen. However, we know less about those who surroundhim and we hope he wall not be influenced by extremists in doing his duty. Itis evident that there is no alternative to him. In this region we are a conservativepeople and the farmers are greatly attached to their property and have a horrorof communism.&quot; He is not a Gaullist but realises France must have a Govern-ment and de Gaulle alone can offer that.The Mayor and his assistant think much along the same lines and they are both Conservatives and religious but, like the Bishop, they are anxious to know what sort of Government policies de Gaulle intends to embark on.The &apos;&apos; Inspecteur Primaire &apos;&apos; for the Arrondissement, as would be expected,is a Gaullist. He says most of the teachers are not Popular Front. Many areConservatives and go to church, but they all recognise the necessity for de Gaulle.The &apos;&apos; President de Tribunal&apos;&apos; hesitates to commit himself and is undoubtedly worried by the legal aspect of the present situation. I believe heis a Vichy appointment.Maitre Huet, a leading lawyer, said that what the people wanted was thefeeling they were once more masters in their own house and naturally had to havea Government for that. He considers the worst people were about 12 per cent,of the commercial classes who had openly and. willingly traded with the enemy,similarly some of the wealthier farmers.   He could see no alternative to de Gaulle.The &quot; Percepteur &quot; (M. Despres) was of the same opinion. He said theAllies should help to bring prices down. The Germans had so much money to spend that prices went up and the Black Market flourished. He said function-aries only wanted to do their duty in &quot;dignity and respect,&quot; but they musthave a Government.M. Andre, a leading farmer, is a Conservative and religious. He is amember of Resistance but not fanatical in his ideas. He is naturally forde Gaulle and against any return of the Popular Front. He emphasised, any-thing that tends to make the farmers fearful for the safety of their propertywould be fatal.M. Morlent, who has the local porcelain factory, criticised the shopkeeperswho voluntarily traded with the enemy. He was for de Gaulle but hoped hisGovernment would do nothing to hinder the resumption of trade.,The Principal du College (local lycee), a &quot;grand blesse &quot; of the last war,said his professors and pupils were in favour of de Gaulle being recognised.It was the only solution. Dr. des Prairies and other leading doctors were ofthe same opinion.Dom Aubour, a Benedictine monk, who circulates a lot among the farmers,said it would be foolish for anyone not to recognise de Gaulle, but the farmers
hoped the inclusion of Communists and Radicals like Pierre Cot in theProvisional Government did not mean the return of the Popular Front. Any -move in that direction would be bitterly resented. He emphasised that themajority of the people always held an unbreakable faith that Britain wouldliberate them and he hoped that nothing would be done to disturb this goodwill.He said he visited a farmer yesterday whose cider apple trees had been ploughedup to make way for a landing strip. Knowing how much this farmer was attached to his property, he asked him about this. The farmer said : &quot; Thafsall right, it&apos;s my contribution to the war.   II faut 9a.&quot;Nearly all emphasised; for the immediate future France would need an authoritative but not dictatorial Government to restore order and bring backprosperity. As one of them put it, the man who gives &apos;&apos; sense of national dignity,order and food &quot; will be respected. They point out the French need the feeling of sovereignty again as much as those in the towns and poor country-side needfood.   The Allies should do nothing against this feeling of national dignity.Miscellaneous.Money.M. Paul, Directeur de Credit Industriel, the local Bank, said the bankreopened on the 14th June. A limit of 5,000 francs on withdrawals was made.He had no big withdrawals in the first two days but, on the contrary, a greatdeal of money was coming in, which showed the confidence of the people, and he felt this would continue.He said that there was sufficient currency locally and so no need for importedfrancs, but they were not being refused. The Germans had taken to Paris, threemonths ago, foreign bonds and money found in the bank&apos;s safe.
