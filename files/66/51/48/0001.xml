Copy No..... ......203W.P.(UU) 3U827TH JUNE. 19UWAR CABINETTHE PLYING- BOMB AMD THE ROCKETMemorandum by the Home secretary and Minister of Home security the public have so far withstood prettywell the growing loss of life and property and generalinconvenience of flying bomb attacks.      They have&quot;been buoyed up with the belief that the situation waswell in hand and that in a short period the R.A.P.would have destroyed the sources of mischief.      This isproving a slow and doubtful process and I am apprehensive of what might happen if the strain continues and,  inaddition to flying bombs, long range- rockets are used against the Metropolis, producing wide areas ofdevastation and consequent heavy loss of life.I have a high degree of faith in theLondoners and the people of the small towns and villages of Southern England.      But the Government andthe Chiefs of Staff will be wise to be human.      Thisis not 19kO-h1.      The Anglo-American Alliance is now a vast military power and the people, not unreasonably,expect a quicker and more decisive defence;    people are asking, &quot;Where is this air superiority.they talk about?&quot;;    each &quot;incident&quot; represents a considerablenumber of domestic tragedies apart from killed and wounded;    the people have had nearly five years ofwar strain - they will resent this new troubleincreasingly   and want to know what v.e are doing abouti t;    day and night they face the risk of death andhorrible injury and the ruin of their homes.      Iassure my colleagues that I have done and will do everything to hold up their courage and spirit -but there is a limit, and the limit will come.

We are told that the long range rocket with a five to ten ton war head, exists,    though little or nothing is known of its perforraanceP how it is to be fired, or how many have already been manufactured, or wriere0     We do know,[ however, that some installations Which, on negative evidence,seem to be destined for firing the weapon,  are nearing completion ana. may be operational in a matter of a fortnightor soa     No very accurate estimate of the scale of attack is available but a theoretical calculation on admittedly scantyinformation gives a maximum of some 700 tons every 2h hoursuntil stocks have been exhausted or the installation or vitalconnecting.links have been destroyed.      In the heaviest attackLondon ever experienced (May 19h1;  about h-50 tons of H.E. onlywere dropped in a nigiit and the Civil Defence personnel,   atthat time much more numerous than they are now,&quot; were severelystrained and could not have held the position much longer.The RoAoFo and &apos;&apos;U. S*A, A.F. will,  as in the case of lying bombs,  doubtless do all that they can to remove themenace, but, unfortunately, as a result of the armoured con-struction of  the large sites,  it seems unlikely that air attackcan destroy them or do more than harrass the enemy *s fire.Search will no doubt be made for the dumps in which&apos; the longrange rockets are stored and for likely sources of productionand bottlenecks,  so that these, too, may be eliminated ifpossible-.      But,  in themselves, none of these measures&apos;canguarantee that the new weapon will not be used;    and german propaganda,which does occasionally contain an element of truth,has in this context promised i:a further turn of the screv/woWe must neglect no possible method of preventing itoThere has not yet been time to ,judge the effects onour soldiers overseas of the knowledge that indiscriminatebombing of their families in &quot;Southern England&apos;1 is taking place,but I should not&apos; be surprised if there is some uneasinessc     now that the Hampshire coastal towns are becoming a target for flying bombs, there may be similar anxiety in the 3Mavy.Jeering references to the impotence   of the greatest military alliance in history,  to destro3r by air or ground attacks, a menace almost within sight of the Capital which it is in process of annihilating, might have been no more than anirritant or source of amusement if flying bombs had not alreadybeen usedo      But the knowledge that indiscriminate air attackis taking place;    the threat of an increased use of secretweapons, and a growing uncertainty as to the fate of those athome, are,  in combination, calculated to have a bad effect onthe morale of the troops as well as upon those under direct attack by the new weapons.These are the immediate psychological dangers ofthe situation as I see it, - and I should&apos; fail in my duty as  .Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security if I did notreport it to my colleagues of the .7ar Cabinet.     The citizens of London have had their full share of this war&apos;s troubles;-   they are entitled to every active protection we can give them..I am not expert on military affairs and am notfamiliar with the military plans, but I feel it ray duty toput the situation before my colleagues of the War Cabinet andto ask for discussion with a view to vigorous, positive action with a view to bringing this business to an end.

I would ask for consideration of the followingpossibilities - I am not competent to put them higher -. and there may be others. -1.      The maximum action to destroy the platforms,supply sites, sources of production and transportation.2. Harrassing bombing over the area of firing by day and night;    possibly also naval bombardment.3. Military action in the Pas de Calais and Dieppeareas with a view to killing the evil at its source;C ommando r ai ds. -1+.     A threat to Germany to bomb to destruction as andwhen opportunity offers their smaller towns, if thisutterly indiscriminate bombing does not cease;    or theuse of gas.      (Such a policy.of reprisals is, ofcourse, not without serious difficulties.)The Prime Minister&apos;s threat of a year ago to&quot;drench the enemy with gas&quot;, if he began the use of thatmethod of attack,  and the knowledge that this was not anidle throat, may explain why,  so far, there has been nogas warfare.   .There may be objections to each and all ofthese ideas.  .  I merely list them as items for discussion.But the Cabinet should,  I suggest, review the situation,and give such directions as are considered necessary and appropriate.H.M.Home Off ic e, S.W,1.&apos;27th June, 191+4.
