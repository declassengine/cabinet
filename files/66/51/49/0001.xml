L.Great George Street, S.W. 1,27th June, 1944.&quot;OVERLORD&quot; SECURITY : DURATION OF SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS.Note by Sir Findlater Stewart.At their meeting on the 13th June (WM. (44) 77th Conclusions, Item 2), theWar Cabinet: (i) Agreed in principle that the special &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; security restrictions,including the visitors&apos; ban and the Irish travel ban, should be removedat the end of June, subject to the retention of any particular restrictionif good, cause were shown.(In this connection the Cabinet directed that particular attention should be paid to the movement of shipping between Irish and continental ports.)(ii) Invited me to work out the detailed arrangements With the Departmentsconcerned.At a meeting which I held on the 22nd June with all the Departments affectedby the special restrictions, we went through all the items listed in the paper which you circulated to the War Cabinet on the 30th May (O.P. (44) 33). Wewere agreed that there were three different types of case in which it might be advisable to make exceptions to the general principle of a return to the pre-&quot; Overlord,&quot; position at the end of June and the maintenance of the restrictions in full operation in the meantime : (a) In certain cases it might be possible to relax particular restrictionssecretly before the end of the month; there would seem to be noobjection to this, provided no overt action was taken, and it would[27715]Printed for the War Cabinet.

I. Restrictions to be Relaxed Secretly before the End of June.The Home Office proposed, and it was agreed, that the drastic restrictions on overseas travel (Recommendation 39 in Appendix I) and on travel to and from ireland (Item I in Appendix II) should be relaxed administratively forthwith;the relaxation will be operated by the Immigration Branch of the Home Office, andwill mean that less stringent criteria are applied when considering applicationsfor exit permits. It can be taken as quite certain that the fact of the relaxationcannot possibly become known before the end of June.Postal and Telegraph Censorship proposed, and it was agreed, that some ofthe delays at present imposed on mail and telegraphic communications might be relaxed gradually, the relaxation beginning at once. Some of these delays have proved very burdensome, and it may take a considerable time to get back to normal, so that anything which can safely be done at once will assist the restora-tion of the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; position as soon as possible after the end of June.There is no danger of the action which Postal and Telegraph Censorship aretaking becoming known.II. Restrictions to be Continued beyond the End of June.By far the most important case in which there is a plea for the continuation ofa particular restriction after the end of June is that of the visitors&apos; ban, and I amreporting separately on this.One of the points to which specific reference was made in the cabinet discussions on the 13th June was the restriction on the movement of shipping from Eire to ports in the Iberian Peninsula (Recommendation 28 in Appendix I).The Dominions Office and the Ministry of War Transport are confident thatthey will be able to prevent the resumption of such direct sailings for a considerable time after the end of June. Some of the Eire ships formerly engaged on the traffic are now on long overseas voyages, and others will probably be requiredin the near future for the transport of coal from Great Britain to Ireland;it should therefore be possible to avoid the return of these ships to their previousroutes without raising the matter formally with the Eire authorities. In thesecircumstances the Dominions Office feel that to raise the matter formally at thisstage with the Eire Government would only produce protest and irritation tono purpose. It was agreed that the Dominions Office and the Ministry of war transport should proceed on these lines; but that, if there at any time appearedto be a risk of the ships being in fact used for traffic to the Iberian Peninsula,the matter should at once be brought to notice.help to restore the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; situation more quickly in caseswhere, for reasons of machinery, the removal of the special restrictions must of necessity be spread over a period of days or weeks.(b) For security reasons it might be necessary to retain individual restrictionsafter the end of June, even though the majority of the special restrictions would then be lifted; in view of the Cabinet decision, suchindividual extensions could clearly only be made where a very strong case for them was made out.(c) In a number of instances measures taken as part of the arrangementsfor &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; security were to be regarded not so much as specialadditional restrictions as steps aimed at the improvement of thepre-&quot; Overlord&quot; security arrangements; it would seem to bepointless to cancel at the end of June anything that had been donein this direction, unless the additional security which it gave apartfrom &quot; Overlord &quot; was clearly not worth the effort or the inconvenienceinvolved in continuing it.I set out below the main restrictions in respect of which we agreed to modify the general principle of retention in full operation until the end of June, followedby complete removal as from that date. Since it was agreed that the bulk of therestrictions should be removed at the end of June in accordance with the general principle laid down by the Cabinet, relatively few of them are mentioned in thisreport; in each case, when mentioning a restriction, I have given the referenceto it in Appendix I to the note which was circulated on the 30th May(O.P. (44)&apos;33).
A second shipping restriction relating to Irish traffic is that imposed on the ports in Great Britain which are used for the short sea traffic with Ireland(Recommendation 32 in Appendix I). It was agreed that some restrictions inthis direction would be necessary for the security of the &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; build-up after the end of June, and the Ministry of War Transport are therefore arrangingthat after that date ports in the Bristol Channel and thence round the south coast to the Thames Estuary should remain closed to this traffic.Other restrictions which it was agreed should continue were the prohibitionof fishing off the south and west coasts of England (Recommendation 33 inAppendix I) and the exclusion of fishing vessels from a defined area off thesouth coast of Eire (Recommendation 34 in Appendix I). These were imposedfollowing a conference of Ministers on the 19th April (O.P. (44) 8th Meeting),when, in addition to the security arguments for them, the Admiralty requestedthem on operational grounds connected with anti-submarine activity. the operational considerations still apply, and it was therefore agreed that therestrictions should remain in force until the position changed.It was agreed that the ban on the export of weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weeklyand evening newspapers (Recommendation 12 in Appendix I) should remain.The Ministries of Information and Home Security favour this, in that it is ofconsiderable value for preventing the leakage to the enemy through localnewspapers of information about the effect of the recent attacks by flying bombs.As from the end of June, however, it was agreed that the export of thesenewspapers to Northern Ireland and Gibraltar should be permitted; the WarOffice welcomed this in the interests of the morale of the troops in these places.In the case of the restrictions on travel to and from Great Britain by Alliedpersonnel (Recommendation 35 in Appendix I), it was agreed that the arrange-ment whereby refugees from Occupied Europe were diverted to North Africa inthe first instance should continue. The object of this is to prevent the congestion of the London Reception Centre, where all such refugees are examined by theSecurity Service, so as to ensure that all who do come receive a thorough examination.III. Restrictions to be Regarded as Improvements in the Pre-&quot; Overlord &quot;Security Arrangements.There are several of the measures taken as part of the special arrangementsfor &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; security which ought to have been taken previously to complete the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; security arrangements. It was agreed that all these shouldbe continued on a permanent basis; they are the following : (a) The arrangements for the control of Press mail and telegrams (Recom-mehdations 4 and 16 in Appendix I). These provide a very valuablecontrol over Press material, and they do not involve any particularinconvenience to the people affected by them.(b) The arrangements for the censorship of all material passing over theprivate Press lines to Ireland, and for the invigilation of *the operators of those lines (Recommendations 18 and 19 in Appendix I).Until these arrangements were made, the lack of complete controlover these lines was inconsistent with the 100 per cent, censorshipimposed on telephonic and telegraphic communication with Ireland.(c) The arrangements for restricting the airports from which civilians canleave Great Britain by air, and for the control of flights by A.T.A.personnel and civilian contractors (Recommendations 11, 24 and 27in Appendix I). So long as such flights by air were uncontrolled,there was a gap in the arrangements for preventing unauthorised, travel to and from this country which have been in operation sincethe outbreak of war.(d) The special precautions which have been taken as regards Police,Railway and Fire Service wireless (Recommendation 22 inAppendix I). These are clearly a valuable contribution to ourpermanent security arrangements.The above summarises the results of my discussions with Departments. Ishould perhaps add that the restoration of the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; position at theend of June will involve announcements in the following cases :  (a) The restoration of the air rnail service to foreign countries and gibraltar, and to prisoners of war in Germany.
(&amp;) The restoration of the E.F.M. telegram service.(c) The removal of the restrictions on overseas travel and travel betweenGreat Britain and Ireland.There will also be some announcement at the end of the month about thevisitors&apos; ban, which will be partly withdrawn if S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s proposals are accepted and wholly withdrawn otherwise..(Signed) S.
