THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-     11Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.&apos;SECRET. Copy, No. ^XW.P. (44) 322.14th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AVIATION.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.1. On the 23rd May* I recommended to the War Cabinet that the Depart-ment of Civil Aviation at the Air Ministry should be transferred to the Ministryof War Transport six months after the end of the War with Germany.2. I now press for immediate action. I ask that Civil Aviation should betransferred forthwith to the Ministry of War Transport. The existing machinery for development of Civil Aviation will not work.3. The future of Civil Aviation is in the balance. Military commitmentsmust take precedence over Civil Aviation. But at present the conflict invariablyresults in the unnecessarv subordination of commercial Aviation. The dualresponsibility of the Secretary of State leads to needless sacrifice of opportunities.Delays arise and difficulties occur which would be avoided if the Civil Depart-ment is relieved of military supervision and restraint.4. One example which has transpired since my last Memorandum will serve to demonstrate the difficulties. For many months British West Indian Airwayshas sought three aircraft to maintain its services. On the 22nd May the C.A.T.Committee recommended that three Hudsons should be provided for the airlineas a matter of national importance and urgency. Three weeks have passedwithout application being made by the Air Ministry to the proper Authority,which is the Combined Munitions Assignment Board in Washington or the board in London.5. Yet aircraft could be supplied. More than 400 airworthy Ansons areavailable now, and could be made useful for Civil purposes.6. If Cheetah XV engines and Rotol feathering propellers are provided,their usefulness for civil work would be improved still further. These engines and propellers are now coming into production for Ansons.7. Several D.H. 89s (Rapides and Dominies) are obtainable and can besupplied without detriment to the War effort, as the Air Ministry has acknow-ledged. t  They are most useful for short-range operations with five passengers.8. There is immediate need for independent representation of British CivilAviation in Washington. Under Air Ministry direction, as at present, service requirements inevitably conflict with civil needs. Service representatives are notin a position to present the Civil demands, when their first consideration must beto provide a maximum supply of military models.9. I therefore ask for immediate action for the transfer of the Departmentof Civil Aviation, as an autonomous unit, from the Air Ministry to the Ministryof War Transport.B.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,14th June, 1944.* W.P.
