Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.SECRET. CbpyTJo.W.P. (44) 325. /Ihth June, 1944. \/WAR CABINET.THE DUFOUR CASE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will remember that the facts of this case were set out in my memorandum (W.P. (44) 286) of the 31st May, and were considered by the WarCabinet on the 1st June. It was agreed that I should consider, in conjunctionwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Attorney-General and a representativeof the Home Office, whether any action could properly be taken to postpone the hearing of this case.2. Acting on this conclusion, I discussed the question of trying to arrangefor the settlement of the case with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Ministerof Aircraft Production, the Attorney-General and Sir Alexander Maxwell. Itwas decided that an approach should be made to the plaintiffs solicitors, witha view to ascertaining whether they would be prepared to settle the case on behalfof their client and, if so, upon what terms. The defendants&apos; solicitors, who werewithout instructions from their clients, were to be kept informed.3. I am now glad to report that as a result of discussions between myDepartment, the plaintiffs, solicitors, and members of the French Delegation, asettlement has been arrived at, the terms of which are shortly as follows : (a) A letter has been written to my Department by M. Vienot stating thatthe French authorities in the United Kingdom do not regard Dufouras a member of the French Forces within the meaning of the relevantActs of Parliament and undertaking that no further steps will betaken against him. \(b) Dufour has withdrawn the pleadings and record in the action, and formalnotice of discontinuance has reached the solicitors formerly acting forthe French.(c) A payment of  2,500 has been made to Dufour&apos;s solicitors ( 500 of whichis for their own costs), and they have given a full receipt and dischargefor all claims arising out of all the facts alleged in their Statementof Claim.(d) A copy of M. Vienot&apos;s letter to the Foreign Office has been given toDufour&apos;s solicitors against a written undertaking by them not to use,publish or copy it without the consent of the Foreign Office.(e) Arrangements are being made as a result of which Dufour will receive:  such papers (including an identity card, ration book, &amp;c.) as arenecessary to enable him to live here as an ordinary French national.4. The Attorney-General was kept informed of the negotiations and has approved the settlement. I regard the settlement as satisfactory, considering allthe circumstances, and I am glad that it has been found possible to prevent theaction being heard in open court at a time which would have seriouslyembarrassed us in our relations with the French.5. The only remaining point is the question of possible publicity. I under-stand that Dufour&apos;s solicitors have undertaken themselves to keep silent and todo their best to persuade their client to do so.   The fact that the action has been12396   [27656]

I regard it as important that these terms should not become public at the present time, but it isof course impossible to ensure that this will be so. If, however, the question is raised in Parliament, I feel that I should be able to justify our part in arranging for the settlement of the action on grounds of policy and our relations with theFrench, particularly since the plaintiffs solicitors are satisfied that their clienthas been fairly treated.A.
