THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.SECEET.W.P. (44) 309.9th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.EMPIRE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Commonwealth Communications Council in their Interim Reportto the Governments of the Empire dated the 10th May, 1944, recommend the con-version of the present system under which the telecommunications services of theEmpire are mainly conducted by companies into a system under which the privateshareholder interest is to be eliminated. The proposal would involve theestablishment of a series of public utility corporations in the United Kingdom,the Dominions and India responsible for the operation * of the telecommunicationsservices in their respective countries and all financially interlocked.2. The present organisation of Empire telecommunications services datesfrom 1928, when, following the recommendations of the Imperial Wireless and cable Conference, a new company, now known as Cable and Wireless Limited,was formed in the United Kingdom, the company representing a merger of theseveral cable companies then in existence with Marconi&apos;s Wireless TelegraphCompany. To the company was also assigned the operation of the beam wire-less telegraph services which at that time were operated by the United KingdomPost Office, together with the assets of the Pacific Cable Board and the twotrans-Atlantic cables owned by the Post Office. The establishment of thisunified organisation was recommended by the 1928 Conference as providing thebest method of meeting the increasing competition of wireless on the one handand of foreign communication interests on the other. The Governments of theEmpire undertook to lend their support to the new organisation which was intended to be the instrument of Imperial telecommunications. Co-ordinationwas to be secured by an Advisory Committee (now the Commonwealth Com-munications Council) consisting of one representative appointed by each of thePartner Governments of the Empire and one by the Secretary of State for theColonies as representing tJhe Colonies and Protectorates.3. Save in the last two or three years when war conditions increased the traffic and revenue far beyond all expectations, the company has throughout its existence been in financial difficulties. Certain adjustments designed to improveits financial position were made, mainly at the expense of the United KingdomGovernment, in 1938, but these afford no permanent solution. After the war,the present temporary benefit due to war conditions will cease and the companywill have to face air-mail competition, loss through currency changes and rises in cost generally. In addition, it will lose heavily through diversion of traffic to the direct wireless circuits opened during the war (e.g., between the Dominionsand the United&apos;States) which- although contrary to agreed policy when thecompany was formed all the Governments agree must be maintained.Increased competition from foreign interests especially the United States &apos;will also have to be faced. There is little doubt that the company will run intoserious financial difficulties within a few years after the war for which a solutionwill have to be found.4. It is against this background that the proposals recommended by theCommonwealth Communications Council must he considered., It must alsobe remembered that a comprehensive and efficient system of telecommunications(with adequate cable provision for security reasons) is an essential economic andstrategical requirement of the Empire.5. In addition to the scheme recommended by the Council, the Interim Reportto the Governments discusses an alternative scheme put before the Council on[27624]Copy No. ^
behalf of Cable and Wireless Limited. A summary of the two schemes is givenin an Annex. The essential difference between the two is that the company&apos;scheme envisages the establishment of a single corporation to operate the tele-communications services of the Empire, whereas the CounciFs scheme envisagesthe establishment of six public utility corporations in the constituentcountries of the Empire. The company&apos;s scheme provides for the issue of stockto be- privately owned with fixed interest at, say, 3 per cent, guaranteed by theGovernments concerned; the Council&apos;s scheme, on the other hand, provides forownership of the capital of the corporations by the respective Governments ofthe Empire.6. In their Report the Council make it clear that the scheme recommendedby the company would not be acceptable to the Dominion Governments. they recognise that the scheme would offer a simplification of the existing organisationand other advantages. In their view, however, it is unacceptable on the groundthat it would deprive the Dominions and India of sovereignty in their ownspheres.  An objection on this ground must, I feel, be accepted as conclusive.7. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned the proposal recommendedby the Council raises an important political issue. It departs from the basis related as it was essentially to private enterprise adopted by the Imperial Wire-less and Cable Conference 1928, and substitutes a system of public ownership and control. In the international field too an important issue is involved. TheUnited States are showing a lively interest in the ownership of world communi-cations after the war and some people in the United States will regard a moveby the Empire on the lines suggested as a hostile act.8. Subject to these two issues, there is much to be said for the proposal of the Council provided that a satisfactory scheme on the lines recommendedcan be worked out. It is attractive from the point of view of Imperial unity and it envisages the assumption by the Dominions and India of responsibilities,both financial and otherwise, in regard to Empire telecommunication services in a forni that has never existed hitherto. It appears, moreover, that a scheme on the lines proposed offers a prospect of a- practical solution of a problem whichwill clearly have to be faced within the next few years. &apos;9. The Council&apos;s scheme was considered at a meeting with Dominion repre-sentatives under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the dominions on the 18th of May last. I attended with the Secretaries of State for Indiaand the Colonies and the Postmaster-General. The Prime Ministers of Australiaand New Zealand stated that their Governments had approved the scheme inprinciple, spoke warmly in its favour and expressed the hope that the UnitedKingdom Government would give it urgent and favourable consideration. Itwas stated on behalf of the other Governments represented that, while readyto give the proposals sympathetic consideration, they must study them in greater detail before reaching a definite view. On behalf of the United KingdomGovernment, it was explained that wide issues were involved and that it hadnot been possible to consider the matter except in a very preliminary way. The -importance of the subject was, however, recognised, and I undertook to place the matter before the War Cabinet with a view to authority being given fora detailed examination of the scheme in all its aspects as speedily as possible.I invite the approval of my colleagues to action on these lines and I suggest thatthe examination should be undertaken by the Postmaster-General and myselfjointly in consultation with the Secretary of State for the Dominions and theother Ministers concerned.10.   Two other points should be mentioned at this stage : (a) Public announcement.It will be desirable to make a statement in the House of Commons atan early date on the subject of these proposals, andthe Governments initialattitude thereto. The statement should, I suggest, be agreed between the secretaries of State for the Dominions and the Colonies, the Postmaster-General and myself. Consultation with the Governments of the Dominions- and India will be necessary.   . .(b) Negotiations with the United States. . .....Sir Campbell Stuart, the Chairman of the Commonwealth Communi-cations Council, visited Washington early this year and entered into discussions on various communication questions with the State Department
and representatives of some of the American companies. Sir Campbellundertook to return to Washington for the purpose of continuing had discussions after the meetings of the Council which have just concluded.I understand that he proposes to do so from Ottawa, which he is visiting inthe summer in response to an invitation from the Canadian Government.:The developments referred to earlier in this Memorandum and the increasinginterest which the United States Government is taking in telecommunicationmatters give additional importance to the question of negotiations with theUnited States and I am by no means clear how far discussions have already goneand to what extent it is right to regard discussions in this field as separable fromthe general problem of relations with the United States. I therefore suggestthat the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be invited to examine these aspects and advise the Ministers concerned.Summary.11.   I recommend : (a) That authority be given for a detailed examination of the scheme recom-mended by the Commonwealth Communications Council in theirReport dated the 10th May, 1944 (paragraph^).(b) That the examination be undertaken by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Postmaster-General jointly in consultation with the Secre-tary of State for the Dominions and the other Ministers concerned(paragraph 9).(c) That an early statement be made in the House of Commons on the subjectof the Report and the position of the United Kingdom Government inregard thereto (paragraph 10(a)).(d) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs be invited to considerthe United States aspect of the telecommunication problem, and advise the Ministers concerned (paragraph 10 (b)).J. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,9th June, 1944.ANNEX.Part I.Scheme recommended by Cable and Wireless Limited.(i) To form a single Empire Corporation operating throughout the Empireand India, with interest at fixed rate to shareholders, guaranteea bythe Governments concerned,(ii) The Corporation to be formed under Royal Charter which covers theDominions, thus obviating the necessity for the matter to go to the parliaments and also preserving the respective sovereign rights.(iii) Existing shareholders of all companies to exchange their stock for stockin the new Corporation, with interest at, say, 3 per cent, guaranteed by the Governments concerned.(iv) Each of the companies to negotiate separately with their Governments. for the amount of stock to be received in exchange.(v) The undertaking to be managed by a Board of Governors in one place,,which shall consist of representatives of the United Kingdom, theDominions, India arid the Colonies, the number from each to bearsome relation to the amount of guarantee and the responsibilities ofthe particular area. &apos;(vi) Governments to control through terms laid down in Charter and bylicences which should be exclusive.(vii) All overseas services now operated, by Governments, including telephony,to be passed to the control of the new undertaking,(viii) Guarantees would have to be given to existing staffs of all companies,(ix) Consideration to be given as to whether it would not be advisable toinclude the manufacturing companies, or some of them, also theship-to-shore communication companies.
Part II.Scheme recommended by Commonwealth Communications Council.(i) A government-owned public utility corporation should be established in the United Kingdom to acquire Cable and Wireless (Holding)Limited.(ii) The establishment of  the United  Kingdom  Cable and  WirelessCorporation should be followed, as soon as can be convenientlyarranged having regard to local conditions, by the establishment inthe Dominions and India of similar government-owned, public Utilitycorporations to take over, from the various authorities at presentadministering them, the external telecommunications services in theirrespective territories.(iii) The United Kingdom and Dominion and Indian corporations should beinterlocked in the following manner. Upon the establishment of eachcorporation in the Dominions and India the United Kingdom cable and Wireless Corporation should transfer to each corporation 5 percent, of the total capital stock of the United Kingdom Cable and wireless Corporation, and should receive in exchange 25 per cent,of the total capital stock in each overseas corporation, or some otherpercentages to be agreed. No financial transaction is involved. Theexchange of stock is not on a valuation basis. The objective is to securethat the four Dominions and India eventually hold 5 per cent, eachof the stock of the United Kingdom Corporation.The United Kingdom, the Dominions and India would be expectedto bear their full share of the responsibility for the maintenance of the cables by the United Kingdom Corporation.(iv) The Board of Directors of the United Kingdom Corporation should,   consist of 11 members, of whom 6 would be appointed by theGovernment of the United Kingdom, which will own, say, 75 per cent,of the stock. Of the remaining 5, the Dominion and Indian Govern-ments should each appoint 1. The United. Kingdom corporation should appoint 1 director to the Board of each of the Dominion and indian corporations upon their formation.
