(44) 329.15th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.APPROACH BY INDEPENDENT FRENCHMEN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE United States Military Attache at Madrid reported on the 1st Junethat, according to a usually reliable source, an important new group was being organised in France called the &apos;&apos; Comite National des Corps Elus de la republique.&apos;&apos; This group was politically opposed to both Vichy and Algiers andwas described as &apos;&apos; desiring a reconstituted democratic Government by popularvote and cultivation of closer ties with England.&quot; Various former politicians ofthe Centre are quoted as among its leaders and it is backed by the big armamentsindustrialists Wendel and Schneider. It claimed to have at its disposal a trainedarmy of resistance, 45,000 strong, under General Revers. It wanted to send a delegation to London at once to arrange co-operation with the Allied forces.2. This Committee evidently represents the latest attempt of the &quot; Comitedes Forges &apos;&apos; and such like elements who have hitherto been collaborationist toreinsure in advance of the Allied victory. It is known that these elementshave been planning for some time to secure United States support for a modifiedVichy Government which would retain Retain but get rid of Laval.3. I have caused Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, tobe informed that my view is that it would be undesirable to invite this Committeeto send a delegation to London, and I have asked that no action should be takenin regard to the new group, except with, the prior approval of General Koenig,the Commander-in-Chief, French Resistance, who has been informed of thesubstance of the report.A. E.Foreign Office, 15th June,. 1944.12397   [27661]Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.
