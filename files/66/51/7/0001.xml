(44) 307.9th June, 1944.\WAR CABINET./32.36&quot;OVERLORD&quot; SECURITY.Note by the Minister of Production.I circulate herewith, for consideration by the War Cabinet, a note bySir Findlater Stewart about the duration of the &quot; Overlord &quot; security restrictions.2. The note recommends that the strict control on the movement of allied military personnel, the1 ban on uncensored communications from Allied MilitaryHeadquarters and the more drastic restrictions on travel to and from GreatBritain should be removed at D + 7, when, in accordance with the War cabinets decision (W.M. (44) 70th Conclusions, Minute 6), the diplomatic ban will be with-drawn. The remaining restrictions should be retained in their present form untilD + 12 and at that stage reviewed in the light of S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s requirements.My own view is that the military authorities should be pressed to remove allthe special restrictions recently imposed except in cases where they can show thatthere are strong military reasons for retaining them.3. I suggest that Sir Findlater Stewart&apos;s proposals should be accepted andthat he should be asked to carry out the necessary review at D -t-12 in consultationwith S.H.A.E.F. and with the Departments concerned.O. L.Great George Street, S.W. 1,9th June, 1944.DURATION OF SPECIAL SECURITY RESTRICTIONS.Note by Sir Findlater Stewart.SINCE I wrote my report on the 23rd May about the duration of the&quot;Overlord&quot; security restrictions the War Cabinet have decided that the diplomatic ban should be continued only until D + 7. My previous reportsummarised the reasons for the maintenance of all the restrictions, including the diplomatic ban, until such time after D day as S.H.A.E.F. were in a position tosay what their new requirements were in the light of the circumstances thenprevailing. This idea of a comprehensive review of the whole field, including the diplomatic ban, will now be out of the question. But there is still, in my view,advantage to be gained by keeping as many as possible of the other restrictions inforce until they can be reviewed as a whole in the light of a later appreciation of the military situation by S.H.A.E.F.; for circumstances after D day might make their retention imperative, and might even call for the restoration of the diplomatic ban. Admittedly, it would be more difficult to make any logical defence[27615]
of the retention of many of the other restrictions once the diplomatic ban had gone; nevertheless, for the reasons given, I see considerable advantages inretaining them.2. By D 4- 12 S.H.A.E.F. hope to be in a position to say what operationalinformation has then to be protected, and what restrictions they think necessaryto that end. The removal of the diplomatic ban will leave a large gap in our security defences; nevertheless, they take the view that a considerable propor-tion of the other restrictions would still retain some of their value, in that, themore we reduce internal movement in Great Britain and the more difficult itis to send communications or to travel overseas, the less is the danger of vitalinformation spreading to and being transmitted by enemy agents (who rarelyuse diplomatic channels for their communications). From the point of viewof deception, the removal of the diplomatic ban will give the enemy animportant indication that the main assault has been launched; nevertheless, the controlling Officer would prefer that the pointer thus given to the enemy shouldnot be emphasised by the withdrawal en bloc of the other security restrictions,and would favour their retention for some time so that their removal could bestaggered.3. I have discussed with the Departments concerned the action whichshould be taken as regards the other restrictions if the diplomatic ban iseffectively withdrawn on D 4- 7. We were generally agreed that the restrictionsfall into two classes those designed to prevent the leakage of information from Great Britain, and those introduced to restrict the spreading of informa-tion within Great Britain. We were also agreed that those in the second classwould not be affected by the removal of the ban, and that their value would, if anything, be enhanced the less information there is spread abroad in GreatBritain, the less the danger that important facts will become known in dangerousquarters.4. The great majority of the restrictions are, however, designed to preventthe leakage of information from this country overseas, and it cannot be argued that these retain their full value once the diplomatic ban is gone. Nevertheless,for the reasons given in paragraph 1, we feel that only those restrictions whichwill be of little value, and which will be obviously vexatious, once the ban has ceased to exist, should be withdrawn simultaneously with the diplomatic ban; forthe most part these are restrictions which were ancillary to the diplomatic banand actually were preceded by it in time. The following are the measures towhich I refer : (i) The strict control by the Service Departments and Headquarters con-cerned of travel to and from Great Britain by Allied military personnel, and the arrangements to prevent Allied Military Head-quarters in Great Britain from sending or receiving any uncensoredcommunications.(ii) The drastic restrictions on travel to and from Great Britain.Under these two headings I would include the restrictions on travel and communications by the High Commissioner of Eire and his staff, the delayimposed on the outward cypher telegrams of the Eire Government transmitted viathis country, and the restrictions at present imposed by the Admiralty on thesailing to and from Great Britain of Allied Naval ships. But I would not includethe restrictions on travel to and from Ireland. So far as the restrictions on travelare concerned, I would not suggest a complete return to the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot;position, but rather the relaxation of the present stringent controls so as to reducethe difficulties and inconveniences they cause when applied to both British and allied, and both military and civilian, personnel; I feel it would, for example, be most unwise to cancel the arrangements we have made to stop the flow of refugees from occupied Europe direct to this country from Gibraltar.5. I therefore recommend that, with the above two exceptions, all therestrictions should be retained in their present form until D + 12, and at that stage considered in the light of S.H.A.E.F&apos;s requirements as then known. Wewould thus retain the majority of the restrictions until such time as we werein a position to say whether or not they would be required by the militarysituation as it appeared after the main assault; and we would avoid the risk of having to restore the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; situation quickly if the way thingsdeveloped after D Day necessitated the restoration of the whole securitystructure.
6. It is generally agreed that the governing principle on which the review on D + 12 should be conducted should be a return, as soon as possible, to thesecurity arrangements previously in force, which are themselves the result of careful planning over a long period. All the special restrictions imposed in theinterests of &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; security were designed to meet a wholly new and dangerous situation, in which a primary object was to prevent the leakage ofany information about the time, place or character of the assault; they involvevery serious interference with the whole life of this country, and after D day we should obviously endeavour to return as soon as is consistent with S.H.A.E.F&apos;s.essential requirements to the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; position.(Signed) S. F. STEWART.Home Defence Executive,Norfolk House, St. James&apos;s Square, S.W. 1,6th June, 1944.
