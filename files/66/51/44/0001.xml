It   is   issued   for   the personal use of copy No.   war CABINETFORMATION OF A JEWISH FORCE TO PARTICIPATE in operations IN europe memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. In a letter dated 28th March, 1944, a copy of which is annexed, Dr. Weizmann,on behalf of the Jewish Agency, raises once more a plea for the formation of a Jewishfighting force within the British Army, to take part in the liberation of Europe. he suggests that the existing Palestine Jewish units, joined together into a division orbrigade group, with the infantry battalions of the Palestine Regiment as a nucleus,would provide the bulk of such a force, which would be supplemented by new recruitsfrom Palestine, volunteers from Jewish refugees in liberated Italy, and North Africa,and such Jews as may be free to join from other countries. The Jewish Agency wouldmake every possible effort to maintain the force up to strength by providing a continuedflow of recruits, and trusts that, barring exceptionally heavy losses in the field, its effortswould be successful.2. The suggestion that a Jewish fighting force should be formed has been brought up from time to time ever since the beginning of the war. The history of the matter is relevant &quot;to a, consideration of the present proposal, and the main facts are&quot; briefly set out below:  (a) &quot;In February, 1940, the War Cabinet gave approval to the policy of. offeringopportunities to Palestinians for enlistment in British units (W.M, (49) 39thConclusions, Item 13). Later in the same year, Mr. Eden, then Secretaryof State for War, saw Dr. Weizmann and came to an agreement with himwhereby Dr. Weizmann was to raise a Jewish army of 10,000 men, of whomnot more than 3,000 were to be drawn from Palestine, the remainder to comefrom America or elsewhere. This force was to be trained in this countryand equipped as and when resources permitted (vide W.P. (40) 404, dated i4th October, 1940). The War Cabinet gave general approval to this arrange-ment, but decided that no announcement could be made or action taken until after the U.S. Presidential election. Dr. Weizmann was to be informed accordingly. Lord Lloyd (then Secretary of State for the Colonies); in thecourse of the discussion, emphasized the danger of a violent Moslem reaction to this project, and urged delay (vide W.M. (40) 269th Conclusions, Item 5).; (b) At the end of 1940, the situation in the Middle East was still very delicate, and,at the instance of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, and the High Com-missioner for Palestine, the Prime Minister decided in March&quot;, 1941, that the project must be put off for six months, ostensibly on the grounds of lack of equipment. In October, 1941, Lord Moyne, then Secretary of State for theColonies, raised the matter again in a paper (W.P. (G) (41) 105 (Revise)),which was produced as a result of consultations with the Secretaries of State&quot;for War and for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State. This paperexpressed the view that the&apos; proposal for the creation of a Jewish fightingforce possessed no great political advantage for us, while the military view was against it owing to the risk of upsetting the Arabs, which would lead toan increased internal security commitment, and owing to the shortage of equipment.
The War Cabinet decided against the proposal, but agreed that,instead, enrolment of Palestinians in the military and police forces inPalestine should be encouraged, primarily for the purposes of local defence, and that, to this end, a few purely Jewish units should be iormed.The enlistment of Jewish technicians in British units was also to be encouraged (W.M. (41) 102nd Conclusions, Item 6). In announcing thisdecision in the House of Lords on 25th November, 1941, no mention wasmade of the possibility of Jewish units being formed, but only of the encouragement to the recruitment of Palestinian Jews into British units. Thecase was rested on the ground that the need to send equipment to Russiamade it impossible for the War Office to proceed with the project under existing conditions.(c) The decision not to proceed with the creation of a Jewish fighting force wasexceedingly unpalatable to Zionist leaders, and a vigorous campaign to reverse it began both here and in America. Some force was lent to the campaign in the summer of 1942 by the unfavourable turn of events in theMiddle East, when it seemed only reasonable that Palestinians should beenrolled for the defence of their own country. Accordingly, in August,1942, I put to the War Cabinet, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies,/33i a- joint memorandum (W.P. (42)^549) suggesting that the time had come./ for the creation of a Palestinian regiment within the British army.   This was accepted by the War Cabinet, and I announced the decision in parliament on 6th August, 1942. The regiment was to consist of three battalions of jews and one of Arabs, formed from the existing Palestinian companies ofthe Buffs with the addition of 10,000 recruits. The regiment was to beemployed in Palestine or adjacent countries for the defence of Palestine.(d) On 3rd September, 1942, G.O.C. Palestine informed the Jewish Agency thatthe role of the Regiment Would be the same as that of the Palestinian Buffs,viz., defence of vital points and the provision of local mobile forces. Thisimmediately led to charges of breach of faith being made by the Jewish- Agency against the Government. It also led to a decrease in the rate ofenrolment into the Palestine Regiment (which, indeed, had never attained the rate promised by the Jewish Agency). Accordingly, in concert with theSecretary of State for the Colonies, I asked the approval of the War Cabinetto a statement being made in Parliament to the effect that the role that the regiment was being called upon to play was a vital one, but that a more active role might be assigned to it in the future (vide W.P. (42) 549). TheWar Cabinet agreed with this statement, which was made on 15th December,1942.(e) In fact, though one of the battalions has been trained for active operations,none of them have been used otherwise than for garrison duties. . one battalion was moved to Egypt in June, 1943, and thence to Benghazi, which led to acts of insubordination; and a proposal has been made by C.-in-C.A.F.H.Q., that one battalion should be moved to Sicily for garrison duties,but this has not yet received approval. Meanwhile, &quot;the agitation for theformation of a Jewish fighting force has continued, but the ground uponwhich it is based has somewhat altered: since the defence of Palestine is nolonger in question, the cry is that the Jews should be allowed to strike theirown blow against their oppressors.3. It is against this historical background that Dr. Weizmann&apos;s proposal must beconsidered. So far, I have given him only a temporizing reply, but the time is evidentlyapproaching when a definite answer must be given. There are cogent military reasons why this answer should be in the negative.   These are shortly as follows:  (a) Organization. The three Jewish battalions are at present all engaged ongarrison or internal security duties, one in Palestine, one in Egypt and one in Cyrenaica. There would be great difficulty in replacing these unitswere they to be taken for an operational role, especially at a time&apos; whenBritish infantry units are having to be disbanded to provide reinforcements.The Palestine Transport units are serving a valuable purpose in Italy, and again, if they were removed, there are no units available with which toreplace them.(b) Training. It is estimated that, dependent on the size, the Jewish force wouldtake from six to twelve months to train.   If it were decided to form, say,a brigade group, it could not begin to train before 1st August, 1944, at,the earliest, and would not be ready for operations until isf February, 1945/in the most favourable circumstances.(c) Role:-It is to be hoped that the war with Germany will have been won by thebeginning of 1945. If this should happen, it is difficult to envisage a usefulrole for a Jewish formation.   There are obvious difficulties in the way of its
being used for internal security work in liberated or occupied enemy countries; and the Jewish Agency have urged that Jewish units should notbe employed in the Far East.(d) Manpower. There is little surplus manpower in Palestine, and it is doubtfulwhether the Jewish Agency&apos;s efforts to find volunteers from Jewish refugeesin Italy, North Africa and other countries would meet with much success.A &quot; net &quot; division (i.e., not including Corps, Army, Lines of Communicationor Base troops) requires 20,000 men, plus 6,000 men a year to replace battlecasualties and wastage. Palestinian Jews at present serving number 12,000,the bulk of them in the Infantry, Works and Transportation Companies ofthe R.E., R.A.S.C. and R.E.M.E. New recruits would be required forartillery, signals and R.A.M.C. These are arms of the Service for whichlong training is necessary.A brigade group requires 4,800 men. Enough Palestinian Jews arealready serving to furnish this, and to maintain it for a time: but again,there would be complete dislocation of existing units, together with thenecessity for prolonged training for the technical arms.(e) Equipment. Production has been reduced to a maintenance level, and the equipment ab initio of a new formation would represent a heavy drain on income. In particular, it would be impossible, without robbing existingformations, to provide the necessary technical vehicles.4. If it is decided to refuse the plea for the formation of a Jewish division or brigade group, the Jewish Agency may well ask that the Palestine Regiment be trained as an infantry brigade. The objection to this from the military point of view is thatstated in sub-paragraph 3 (a) above: it would be necessary, and very difficult, to findother units to perform the garrison duties now being undertaken by the Regiment.&apos;The training of the Regiment as an infantry brigade would also take a considerable time.5. The creation of a Jewish fighting formation, whether division, brigade groupor infantry brigade, would inevitably cause a diversion of effort in organizing, equippingand training it at a time when all our efforts are, and should rightly be, concentrated on the one task of defeating the enemy in the shortest possible time.6. In the foregoing paragraphs, I have dealt only with the military objections tothe proposal to create a Jewish fighting force, and I have not mentioned such political objections as there may be. I cannot, however, conceal from my colleagues my anxietyas to what lies behind the agitation in its favour. There exists in Palestine a quasi-secretarmy, namely the &quot; Hagana which has a potential strength of some 100,000 menand women. Of these, some 25,000 may be termed first-line troops and could be called out at short notice. They are known to have a large quantity of arms. It seems but tooprobable that the Zionists desire to have their men trained, at our expense, in active operations, so that, should our policy in Palestine not meet with their approval, they canpresent us with a formidable military commitment if we endeavour to assert such apolicy by force. In default of the establishment by H.M.G. of a Jewish National state in Palestine, the Jews may well attempt to present us with a fait accompli at a time when our main effort is directed towards the defeat of Japan. An increased commitment inPalestine at such a time, when we will also be in difficulty in finding sufficient troops for the occupation of enemy countries, would be acutely embarrassing.pj.g.War Office,26th June, 1944.(18184)
TOP secret annex TO W.P. (44) 344THE JEWISH AGENCY FOR PALESTINE77, Great Russell Street,London, W.C.I.2&amp;th March, 1944.The Right Hon. Sir James Grigg, P.C., M.P.,War Office,Whitehall, S.W.I.Sir,&apos; I beg to submit a plea for the formation of a Jewish Fighting Force within theBritish Army, to take part in the liberation of Europe.2. The claim of the Jewish people to be represented on the field of battle againstNazi Germany by a distinctive military unit was voiced by the Jewish Agency fromthe beginning of the war. It sprang from the desire, shared by Jews throughout theworld, but strongest among the Palestine Jews, to take a direct and acknowledged partin the struggle against their mortal enemy. It was fortified by the conviction that theJewish contribution to the war effort would be very considerably increased if, insteadof fighting scattered and nameless, they were united in a force of their own, whichwould heighten their esprit de corps and their sense of national pride and responsibility.3. In October, 1940, the formation of a Jewish Fighting Force to consist of 10,000men, of whom a maximum of 3,000 was to be drawn from Palestine, was approved bythe Cabinet. In December, a Commanding Officer of the Force was selected, and discussions began between him and the Jewish Agency concerning details of the scheme.On 3rd March, 1941, the Jewish Agency was informed that, because of the lack of equipment, the formation of the Force would have to be deferred, for six months at the longest. When the six months were out, a further postponement was signified to us,and eventually the whole scheme was shelved. From conversations with political andmilitary representatives of H.M. Government, both in London and in Cairo, it was understood that the fear entertained in certain quarters of a hostile Arab reaction hadbeen responsible for the abandonment of the project.4. The formation of a Jewish Fighting Force was not made a condition of the voluntary enlistment of Palestinian Jews into the British Army. That enlistment beganalmost immediately on the outbreak of war. It was actively sponsored by the executive of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem, and the National Council of Palestine Jews. TheJewish Agency established a special recruiting organization with a network &quot;of recruiting offices throughout the country. Both the Jewish Agency and the PalestineJewish community have shouldered heavy financial responsibilities in supplementing theinadequate family allowances, and providing the hitherto non-existent dependents&apos;grants. So far, 24,000 Palestinian Jews (men and women) have joined H.M. Forces,of whom about 12,000 men are to-day in the Army, for the most part in all-Jewish units mostly companies in the various technical corps, but including three infantry battalions.   All the Jewish units are officered, and many are commanded, by Jews.5. Although the formation of Jewish units Jewish in fact though not in name has given some measure of satisfaction to our people, the smallness of the units, theirdispersal and obliteration, and above all the denial of national status and of direct,collective, participation in the fighting, makes them all smart under a feeling of frustra-tion. The fact that the Jewish Battalions have been exclusively employed on stationaryguard duty constitutes a particular grievance.6. In the coming new phase of the war the invasion of Europe the jewish agency asks that the question of the formation of a Jewish Fighting Force be recon-sidered. The existing Palestine Jewish units joined together into a division or a brigade group with the infantry battalions as a nucleus would provide the bulk of it, and could be supplemented by new recruits from Palestine, by volunteers from among jewish refugees in liberated Italy and North Africa, and by such Jews as may be free to join the Force from other countries. The Jewish Agency would make every possible effort to maintain the force up to strength by a continued flow of recruits, and trusts that,barring exceptionally heavy losses.in the field, its efforts to fill vacancies created bynormal discharges and casualties will be successful.
j. It is assumed that the reasons which in 1941 told against the fulfilment of theoriginal promise to establish a Jewish Fighting Force no longer apply in 1944. What-ever substance there may have been in the argument about the irritating effect of theJewish Force on Arab countries, the forming of existing Jewish units into a coherentgroup to act in the European theatre of war cannot possibly be represented as their concern. On the other hand, collective participation in the battle of Europe is a definiteJewish concern. Europe is now the graveyard of millions of massacred Jews. the remnants live in the shadow of death. The world outside has failed to save them. Theleast we can ask is that a force of free, fighting, Jews be enabled to uphold the honour of their people, avenge its martyrs, and help to liberate the survivors.0, As soon as a decision in principle is adopted, the Jewish Agency will desire toput forward proposals on points of detail, and to discuss them with the competenta uthorities.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient servant,(sd.) C. L. WEIZMANN.(b44/188)   100   6/44   w.o.p.   18184
