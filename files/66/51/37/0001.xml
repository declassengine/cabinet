(44) 337.20th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.PRESS REPORT ON FRANCE.Note by the Secretary of the War Cabinet.BY direction of the Prime Minister the attention of the War Cabinet andof the Defence Committee is drawn to the attached article on France which appeared in the Sunday Pictorial of the 18th June, 1944.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,20th June, 1944.ARTICLE FROM &quot; SUNDAY PICTORIAL,&quot; 18th JUNE, 1944,by Rex North:   &quot;These People Terrify Me.&quot;Normandy.I THOUGHT I should be sitting here on the beaches of France reporting the War. But I am forced to the conclusion that there is another and possibly even more important story to write to-day.It is a grave and disturbing story; of a people who are divided among themselves^ and divided to a large degree against us.Soberly and factually I must set it down. Six out of ten of the people over here distrust and detest us, and I have carefully checked the figure. Further,more than half seem to be allies of the Germans so that it is impossible to tellwho, if any- of them, are our friends.This should be set down now in fairness to the men who will one day come over to carry a gun in France, and so that every thinking man and woman athome may know the truth.For, like so many others, I expected everyone to fete our victorious forces as they come in. Instead, I have spent a week wondering where the next Frenchbullet was coming from.I expected to find a starved, oppressed country that would cry out for armsand for the right to stand up and fight with our armies of liberation.Turned Away.Instead, over half the French I met in Normandy had no wish to be liberated.Men on street corners wearing German field grey trousers, let me add turnedtheir backs on me.  Others just happened to spit at that moment.Once I thought that all we had to do was to beat the Germans with ourarmies. Now frightening thought that it is I know that there is a problem just as urgent.Somehow, we have got to get these men and women of France on&apos; our side.Somehow we must reach the people with the message that we are not bombing and blasting their cities merely to save ourselves. As it is I,must confess thatthe attitude of these people to our cause terrifies me.&quot;[27672]Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.
Let me show you some of the unsuspected scenes that have happened in front of me during the last few days.   &apos;I met Jeanne rushing down a village street, hair awry, her coat torn onbarbed wire. She was clutching at the arm of a German prisoner who was beingmarched to the coast.She was not alone. Seven other women were doing the same to seven other german prisoners.   Presumably for the same reason as Jeanne.Por this girl she is only eighteen was a mere child when the Germanscame to Normandy. &quot; This is France&apos;s saddest day &quot; her father told her, andtheir little village shop was kept closed. The Germans would loot and plunderthey felt sure.But what happened ? Instead, the Germans were stiffly polite. Theybrought trade, were scrupulously honest under orders in everything they did.And in Normandy, the roses still blossomed as before, the cattle grazedpeacefully. The artichokes, asparagus, crisp lettuce and vegetables were just as they had always been.  The butter was as creamy, the eggs as plentiful.The war ? There was no war in Normandy when we marched in. All thisweek I have been trying to find one man who was forced to go to work in Germany.I couldn&apos;t&apos;t find one. They heard stories of starving Paris, but they felt as remotefrom it as you did when the miners were starving in Rhondda.Years passed. Jeanne, who was a kid, had been prepared to despise everyGerman on sight, fell in love with one.   Then we arrived to liberate her.Our armies of liberation, our bombs, rockets and bullets, killed Frenchmenas well as Germans. And though it is true that some of these women hadhusbands who were prisoners of war in Germany, four years is a long time. Ifyou are not hurt you are apt to forget.Our armies also robbed a lot of Jeannes in France of their German boyfriends. Jeanne the woman who spat and said &apos; Damn the British!&apos; istypical of, a lot of young France. She is a potential sniper. There are thousands of them over here.It is a strange, frightening, confusing business walking through France now,I assure you. &quot;Keep your head low,&quot; they told me, &quot;there are still a fewGerman stragglers in that forest.&quot; And the forest was only 400 yards from thecoast.&quot; Don&apos;t go down that side street,&quot; I was warned. &quot; Keep to the main road..... These French snipers have killed a dozen of our blokes in the last two days.&quot;It is not nice to be shot1 at from back and front by the people you have come to liberate.I walked into a shop, asked for a glass of anything they had got. This wasin Courseulles. The woman pointed to a notice &quot; Out of Bounds to all BritishTroops.&quot;According to the printed instructions our troops receive, this is to save hard-pressed French civilians from being robbed of their food and drink. I supposewe know what we are doing, but it is up to me to point out that the owner of thisparticular shop was upset. The Germans spent money there and bought a lot ofher cider. She had come to the conclusion quite wrongly of course that theAllies are mean.  And she does not love us any more for it.Few Poor.&quot; Don&apos;t buy food at a farm,&quot; our men were ordered, &quot; it will mean a Frenchchild starving.&quot; And yet in scores of houses in France they are willing to serveyou with steak, asparagus-plus a few strawberries and cream to follow-for 65.The answer, I feel sure, is that the food position will be quite different when we come to the big cities. In Normandy only the poor starve. Only the poor have felt the war. That is why the rest were doing very nicely until we arrived. Whythe woman I asked : &quot; Aren&apos;t you glad to see us? &quot; said &quot; Oui &quot; and turned herback on me.It was the Mayor who told me about the poor. He came puffing down theroad on a cycle, stopped me, flourished his visiting card and was anxious to befriendly. I imagine the fact that he was Mayor while the Germans were thereproves that he was not too unfriendly in that quarter, either.&quot;Is there adequate food?&quot; I asked.&quot;There was until recently,&quot; he replied meaning until we arrived. &quot;Ofcourse,&quot; he added, &quot; there are always the poor and unfortunate.&quot;In Normandy the Germans brought trade. The middle classes and the richwere able to make just that much more money to keep pace with rising prices.The poor got poorer.  The poor went hungry.
It is the poor who are genuinely pleased to see us now. I&apos;offered one womanmoney.   She refused.   I gave her food.   She grabbed at it, and cried a little.. &quot; What are the people like medically? &quot; I asked the R.A.M.C. &quot; One intwelve is suffering from tuberculosis,&quot; they said.   The poor again.Well fed.Yet most of the people I saw in Normandy were rosy-cheeked and healthy.I ate with one woman. Her cupboards were full, and I remember wishing mywife had been there.At home we have to give up our butter to the child. Here no one would, havenoticed the difference if I had eaten an ounce with every slice.I spoke to another woman. We were talking, and. she was telling me howhappy she was that we had arrived. At that moment a group on the other sideof the road beckoned to me.&quot; Don&apos;t talk to her,&quot; they said, wagging fingers mysteriously. &quot; She&apos;sBoche,&quot; I walked on down the road. Someone else stopped me, and pointing tothe group who had just warned me, he whispered., &quot; Boche.&quot;It seems that you dare trust no one here. I have met not a single person aboutwhom I would swear on my honour that he or she is a friend.of the Allies.What is the explanation to all this ? I have wondered, puzzled and talkedto people who might know.Why do the French snipe at us wave excitedly to our troops as they entera place lead them to exactly the position where the snipers want them?One officer seemed to think that the Germans had dropped faked. &apos;&apos; Alliedparachutists &quot; before the invasion that they had knocked on doors pleadingfor help.  In that way they are supposed to have weeded out all the pro-British.It may be true, but I must confess that no Frenchman I met knew anythingabout it.Personally, I find it easier to believe that the Germans, strictly under orders,have behaved so well in Normandy that the French have got used to them. Thata whole generation has been growing up with these Nazis, and because theirown young men are in German prison camps the inevitable has happened.They see the Allies now as people who have brought only bombed andshattered houses. Their ignorance of our cause, of the vital importance of ourvictory to Europe, is appalling.I cannot tell you how all this can be put right, but in my view it is far moreimportant for us to win these people over to our way of thinking than forMontgomery to capture another town.Decisions of the highest importance must be made. Already there are far too many British soldiers buried beneath wooden crosses in France after meeting with French bullets.
