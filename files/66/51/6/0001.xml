THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1944. &apos;secret. / Copy: No.W.P. (44) 306.9th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.WAR PENSIONS.Joint Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.SINCE the issue of the recent White Paper on Service Pay and allowances and Pensions (Cmd. 6251) there have been certain further developments whichwe wish to report to the War Cabinet.A. -Widows and Children of Other Ranks.We have received a deputation from! the Service Members of the House ofCommons Committee, led by Mr. R. H. Turton, M.P., which had asked to beallowed to make representations on the new pension rates for the widows andchildren of other ranks announced in the White Paper, The Service MembersCommittee had expressed themselves as &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; with the disparity between the new pension rates and the increased allowance rates for the wives and children of serving men. An account of the proceedings is annexed, and we now seek the War Cabinet&apos;s approval for the view which we expressed to thedeputation that the decisions announced in the White Paper should be maintained.2. The White Paper increased the minimum (private&apos;s) rate for widowswith children to 32s. Qd. a week and raised the Children&apos;s allowances to a flat rate of 11s. a week. The comparison which is drawn is between these rates andthe corresponding minimum rates for the wives and children of serving men,which are 35s. and 12s. 6d. respectively. As was explained to the Members ofthe House of Commons deputation, this comparison is quite fallacious in itself.Moreover, it fails to take account of factors such as rent supplementation payable to widows and of additional allowances payable in the form of educationallowances. In any case there is no reasonable ground for seeking to equalise the .rates which are designed to meet quite different sets of circumstances : a widow&apos;obligations and commitments are not the same as those of the wife of a servingman. Looked at absolutely the rates are certainly not unreasonable. A private&apos;swidow with three children now receives 32s. Qd. a week for-herself, 33s. in respectof her children and very likely a rent supplement, making on an average a totalof nearly 70s. a week. She may also receive additional payments in the form ofeducation allowances. Provision is made for continuing the payment of wife&apos;allowance for a period after the man&apos;s death so as to enable the widow to adjustherself, to the new circumstances.3. We are therefore strongly of the opinion that the rates announced in theWhite Paper should be maintained. Any change would have repercussions. overa wide field, including the new scheme of compensation for industrial injury, andwe are fully satisfied that the new pensions rates are fully adequate, and indeedliberal, in themselves.4. If the War Cabinet agree that the rates announced, in the White paper should be maintained, the Service Members Committee may wish to raise thematter in the House (see for instance the remarks attributed to Sir Ian Praseron pa*ge 5 of the Annex to this Memorandum). If so. we would propose to takethe line that the question of a debate on this subject is one,which should, be pursued through the usual channels.[27619] b
B.  Widotvs and Children of Officers.5.   On the day after we received the deputation from the House of Commons,the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reported to the War Cabinet theresult of the debate which had taken place in the House of Lords on a motionby Lord Cork and Orrery about the pensions for the widows and children ofofficers.   As this matter is closely linked with that covered in the preceding paragraphs we ought perhaps to indicate our views on it also.  The White Paperchanges in war pensions flowed from the decisions regarding pay and allowances,which were based on the general principle of giving assistance where it is most needed, i.e., to family men in the lower-paid ranges, whether officers or other ranks.   In pursuance of this principle the widow&apos;s rates for officers below the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel were adjusted, and it is unreasonable for the criticsto brush this fact aside.   The increase for the widows of Subalterns was from 130 to  150 a year.   As regards the children of officers the existing rate of 36 a year (i.e.; already a fiat rate for each child) was deliberately left unchangedbecause it was felt that the difference between this figure (which works out at13s. lOd. a week) and the figure for the children of other ranks (11s. a week)is as great as in modern conditions is justifiable.  Moreover the rate for deceasedofficers&apos; children is now almost exactly the same as the new flat rate of 14s.a week for the children of living officers, whereas in the case of the children of other ranks there is a drop on the death of the father from 12s. Qd. a week to 11s.  Deceased officers&apos; children are equally eligible with children of deceasedother ranks for education allowances up to  50 a year each.   There will alreadybe many cases where on the assumptions normally made as to the proportion ofhis pay which an -officer allocates to his family the family&apos;s resources will infact increase and not diminish on the officer&apos;s death.6. In the debate in the House of Lords a proposal was made by Lord Bennettthat widows&apos; pensions should be exempt from taxation. This proposal is opento strong &quot;objection. The position as regards the incidence of income tax on the emoluments of the dependants of men in the Services is already highly anomalous.To add another exemption merely goes further towards falsifying all true com-comparisons between one person&apos;s financial situation and another&apos;s. Moreover theeffect would be small and unequal in its incidence. The children&apos;s pensions andthe education allowances are already free of income tax and it is only the widow&apos;pension which is chargeable. This means that where the widow of an officerbelow Lieutenant-Colonel&apos;s rank has two or more children, she in fact paysno income tax at all unless she has other income.7. We accordingly recommend that no change should be made in the pension rates for officers&apos; widows and children, as now revised. A Subaltern&apos;s widow with two children receives  222 a year, which with the education allowances may beincreased to as much as  322 a year; on these sums no tax is payable and though there are bound to be exceptional cases of hardship, we must regard provision on this scale as fully adequate to meet all reasonable requirements. It is perhapssignificant that the deputation from the House of Commons, although itselfcomposed almost entirely of officers or ex-officers, made no mention of any claim on behalf of officers&apos; widows and children.8. We have consulted the Minister of Pensions and the Leader of the Houseof Lords, who agree witluour recommendations, though we understand that thelatter is circulating a separate Paper expressing his views.* If our recommenda-tions are accepted by the War Cabinet it may be desirable that a deputation from the House of Lords should be received and the matter explained to them as it was to the deputation from the House of Commons.C.

ANNEX.Record of Discussion with a Deputation of the Service Members&apos;Committee.THE Lord President of the Council, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Minister of Pensions receiveda deputation representing the Service Members&apos; Committee at 6-30 p.m. on the23rd May, 1944, in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Room at the House of Commons.The deputation consisted of the following Members : Mr. R. H. Turton, M.P.Mr. Hugh Molson, M.P.Major C. Taylor, M.P.Captain Bernays, M.P.Major B. Nield, M.P.SirGifford Fox, M.P.Sir Ian Fraser, M.P.Colonel C. E. Ponsonby, M.P. (Parliamentary Secretary to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs), Sir E. Brocklebank, M.P. (Parliamentary Secretary to theChancellor of the Exchequer), and Mr. W. L. Gorell Barnes (War Cabinet Offices)were also present.War Pensions.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to the letter which mr. Turton had written to him on the 4th May on behalf of the Service Members&apos;Committee. He and his two Colleagues were grateful to the Committee for having raised the matter in this way, since they were convinced that it was better that it should be discussed privately before any public discussion took place.Mr. Ttirton, who thanked the Foreign Secretary for agreeing to receive thedeputation, said that the Service Members&apos; Committee were grateful for the substantial way in which their views in regard to service pay and allowanceshad been met in the recent White Paper. They wished, however, to raise two important points in regard to the new war pension rates which had been announced at the same time. Before the 1st May, a private&apos;s widow received apension of 26s. 8d. as compared with the allowance of 25s. which she had receivedwhen her husband was alive. Following the change introduced on the 1st Mayshe now received 32s. Qd. as compared with an allowance of 35s. Again, beforethe 1st May the Ministry of Pensions&apos; rates for children had been the same asthe rates of allowances for the children of serving men (9s. Qd. for the first child,8s. Qd. for the second and 7s. Gd. for the third child), whereas now the Ministryof Pensions&apos; rate was 11s. for each child as compared with an allowance of 12s. Qd.for each child of a serving man. Thus, the income of the wife of a serving man with three children would now be reduced by 7s. a week if her husband was killed in action, whereas previously it would have been increased by Is. 8d. this situation was particularly anomalous, seeing that the income of a wife without children was in certain cases still increased by Is. 8*1 if her husband was killed.It was true that a widow was eligible for rent supplementation in addition toher pension. This supplementation had, however, been payable before the1st May. Moreover, this benefit was offset by the loss of any war service grantwhich the widow might have received during her husband&apos;s life-time, x^notherargument which could be adduced was that, whereas the serving man&apos;s family allowances were designed to meet a temporary need, war pensions were in thenature of a permanent annuity. This argument did not, however, seem to him tobe valid in the case of the children. In any case, such arguments, whether validor not, were not readily appreciated by the serving man, who tended simplv to compare the two figures. There was no doubt but that the differentiation between the family allowances and the war pensions rates was having an adverse effect on morale, and it was for this reason that the Service Members&apos; committee felt strongly that it should be rectified.
Other Members of the Deputation spoke in support of the views expressedby Mr. Turton; and Sir Ian Fraser urged, in addition, that the rate of allowance for the children of disabled ex-servicemen (at present 7s. 6d.) should also bebrought up to the rate of allowance for the children of serving men.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that before the 1st May the allowance for the wife of other ranks below the rank of Corporal had been ona scale rising from 25s. to 32s., whilst the rate for widows of serving men ofthe same ranks had been a flat rate of 26s. 8d. The position now was that widows and wives alike received a flat rate, the former of 32s. 6d. and the latter of 35s.Thus, whereas previously widows had received amounts varying from Is. 8d. more to 5s. 4d. less than wives, they now all received 2s. 6d. less. Bearing in mind thefact that very few serving men on the minimum rate of pay were killed, it wasnot true to say that the relative position of the widow had been worsened as aresult of the changes. It was true that, when the rates of war pensions had been reviewed in the autumn of 1943, the rates for children had been brought up tothe level of children&apos;s allowances of serving men. This level had, however, then been very much lower. Moreover, in making a comparison between the Ministryof Pension rates for children and the rates of allowances for children of servingmen, it was not unfair to take into account to some extent the rent supplementa-tion payable to widows, which was a contribution to the support of the familyas a whole. There were also the additional allowances payable in the form ofeducation allowances. In any case, he did not think that the principle of equalitycould be accepted, since a widow&apos;s obligations and commitments were not thesame as those of a wife of a serving man who looked forward to the return ofher husband.Looked at absolutely, the position of the family of a serving man who waskilled had been very greatly improved by the recent changes. When the WarPension rates had been reviewed in the autumn of 1943, the increases then madehad, he thought, been accepted as adequate. Yet, as a result of the new changes,these rates-had now been further increased by 5s. lOd. in the case of the widowand Is. 6^., .2s. 6d. and 3s. 6d. in the case of the first, second and third childrespectively. A private&apos;s widow with three children now received 32s. 6d. inrespect of widow&apos;s pension, 33s. in respect of children&apos;s allowances, and probably,on an average, 5s. in respect of rent supplementation making a total of 70s. 6d.She might also receive further allowances in the form of education allowances.Bearing in &quot;mind the fact that provision was made for continuing the paymentof the wife&apos;s allowance for a period after a serving man&apos;s death sufficiently longto enable the widow to adjust herself to her new circumstances, he could notavoid the conclusion that the new rates were liberal.The Chancellor added that he was obliged to consider what would be theeffect of any further increases on other forms of peace-time expenditure. TheGovernment were hoping shortly to introduce a scheme of compensation for industrial injury which would be very closely assimilated to the war pensions scheme; and there was no doubt that any further increases in war pensions wouldhave repercussions on the rates of payment under this new compensation scheme.Again, there was a very substantial gap between the existing war pensions ratesand the rates payable by the Assistance Board, which had recently been increased at an annual cost of  40 million. He recognised that some difference was fully justified. It was, however, already so large that it was quite clear that further increases in war pensions rate would lead to very great pressure, which it wouldbe increasingly difficult to resist, for further improvements in the assistance board rates. He had thought it right that, especially in present circumstances,an unusually generous provision should be made for the families of serving men.In considering any proposals which involved long-term commitments, he was,however, bound to have in mind the cumulative effect of the various obligationsinvolving post-war expenditure which the Government were assuming; and it was his duty especially to scrutinise closely any proposals for increases in rates which,like the Ministry of Pensions rates, seemed in themselves already to be adequate,if not liberal.The Lord President of the Council said that, in his view, a very difficult position would be created if everything which was done for the serving soldierwas taken as a precedent for rates involving long-term expenditure. There was a danger that the resultant commitments would so increase the burden of income tax and its effect on net wage rates as to cause a serious reaction. He was particu-larly disturbed at the prevailing tendency to desire to see all rates of allowancesequalised even when the circumstances which the various allowances were designed
to meet were not the same. In this particular case it was clear that the warpensions rates were not strictly comparable with the rates of family allowances of serving men either as regards the conditions of their payment (e.g., in respect ofthe ages of the children) or as regards the circumstances which they were designed to meet. Admittedly such considerations were not easily explained tothe serving men. He and his two colleagues had, however, looked very closely intothe matter and had come to the conclusion that the new war pensions rates were fully adequate.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was in agreement withthe views expressed by the Chancellor and the Lord President, and was particularly conscious of the effects which any further increases in war pensions would have in other fields of post-war expenditure. The matter had not yet been before the War Cabinet; but he and his Colleagues had thought it right to informthe deputation frankly of the conclusion which they had reached after a very careful examination of all the circumstances.Captain Bernays said that Members of Parliament did not find it easy toexplain to their constituents, who were influenced by the optimistic opinions on thesubject of inflation which were at present receiving wide currency, the kind of considerations which had been put forward by the Chancellor. Could not theGovernment take Members more into their confidence e.g., as regards the extentof the post-war commitments to which the Chancellor had referred ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, so far as the present questionof war pensions was concerned, he was preoccupied not so much by the danger of inflation as by the effect of any further increases, and of their repercussions, onthe level of post-war taxation. He thought that the new war pension rates could,without difficulty, be defended as being liberal in themselves and also as representing a substantial increase, largely unsought, over the improved rates which had been introduced in the autumn of 1943 and had then met with general acceptance. He agreed, however, that the Government should, as soon as possible,give Members such information as would enable them to see the post-war financialpicture as a whole.Mr. Turton said that his personal view was that the arguments which hadbeen adduced against further increases in the Ministry of Pension rates were less valid in the case of children than in the case of widows.Sir Ian Fraser said that he had asked Mr. Speaker to give him an opportunityon the Adjournment on Friday, the 26th May, to raise the points in regard toWar Pensions which were the subject of the Motion which was on the order paper. He had proposed to raise the matter in this way as he thought that thiswould be most convenient for the Government and was unlikely to lead to afurther discussion of service pay and allowances, which would be undesirable atthe present time. He understood, however, that the Minister of Pensions couldnot be in the House on Friday, and after the discussion which had just takenplace, he was prepared not to raise the matter then, though he must naturallyreserve his right to intervene if it was raised from another quarter. He stillthought, however, that the question should be raised and, unless in the meantimecircumstances arose which caused him to change his view on this point, he wouldprobably wish to raise it after the Whitsun Recess.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he and his colleagues would consider the points which had been made by the Deputation and would report to the War. Cabinet. The question whether or not there should be a debate in the House might perhaps be reviewed after Whitsuntide.Service Pay and Allowances Position of Junior Officers.In the course of the discussion Members of the deputation expressed the viewthat, whilst the increases in1 service pay and allowances which had been announced in the &quot;recent White Paper were in other respects satisfactory, the remuneration of officers below the rank of Major in the Army, and the corresponding ranks inthe other two Services, was still inadequate. In this connection it was alleged that a large proportion of Court Martial cases in the Services were due to thefinancial embarrassment of junior officers; and attention was drawn to thedifficulty of persuading Warrant Officers, to seek promotion owing to the lack offinancial inducement.
Mention was also made of the following alleged anomalies : (a) That there were two rates of family allowances for junior officers knownrespectively as the &quot; old &quot; rates and the &quot; new &quot; rates, and that officers on the &apos;&apos; old &apos;&apos; rates had not received any increase in pay.(b) That as a result of adjustments in the allotment certain childless membersof the R.A.F. were actually receiving less pay than they had receivedbefore the changes announced in the White Paper.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the White Paper had only dealtwith the main issues raised by the representative Members who had taken partin the recent informal discussions. Points of detail raised in those discussions and adjustments arising out of the main changes announced in the White paper were at present being considered by the Departments concerned. When this examination was complete a report would be submitted for consideration by ministers. Meanwhile, he and his Colleagues were not in a position to comment on the points which had been raised. The Grovernmenfs decisions would, however,be announced in due course; and in the meantime .he could assure the Membersof the deputation that the adjustment of any anomalies affecting junior officers was not necessarily ruled out.
