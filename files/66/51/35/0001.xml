THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13 government confidential WAR CABINET Copy No- - ..    ^     &quot;W.P.(UU)33517th June, 19kkWAR PENSIONS:    EDUCATION ALLOWANCES for children OF OFFICERS DYING AS A RESULT OP service memorandum &quot;by the Minister of PensionsI have read Lord Cranbo$irne1 s memorandum of the 8th June,W,P. 314* and feel that I ought to make a few observations onhis proposals in paragraph 8 to the effect that the presentmaximum of  50 for education allowances to the children ofofficers and other ranks should &quot;be increased for officers&apos;children &quot;but not for others.The maximum rate fixed in 1939 for this war was  35 for allclasses of children.     This was based on the maximum then in force under peace-time regulations for officers&apos;   childrenj  and thepresent figure of  50 has been arrived at &quot;by a series of increases&quot;broadly similar to those which have &quot;been made from time to time inthe pension rates generally!      As this maximum is stillconsiderably lower than the figure of  80 within which allowancescould be made in Great War cases I should offer no objection toan all-round increase within that limit and, as allowances, inexcess of  50 would in any event be quite exceptional, the costof such an improvement would be very small.I feel strongly, ho?/ever , that it will not be possible tojustify differentiation in this matter between officers&apos;   children and others.      The recognition of merit for which Lord Crahborne asksis already provided in the higher rates of pension for widows andof ordinary allowances for children, and I think both the House ofCommons and the public would strongly resent differentiation -between children equally deserving of better education and equallycapable of deriving &quot;benefit from it.      Lord Crahborne recognises that there is today no officer class in the old sense of the term,but it is nevertheless true that the children of other ranks whoare most lively to qualify for the higher rates of educationallowances are those of men who would have been able to provide amore expensive education, and I can see no defence for refusingthis benefit to such children merely &quot;because their fathers did not receive, or did not wish to receive,  commissioned rank.-W.W.
