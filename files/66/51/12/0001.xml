84[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMTIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET 9 fW.P. ( ^)312 Copy No.    ^9th June,CABINETThe Horse-Racing Programme.Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary and minister of Home SecurityRecent restrictions on rail transport have raised thequestion whether any further curtailment of horse-racing is called for.The policy governing racing and other outdoor sports wasconsidered &quot;by the War Cahinet at its meeting of 2nd March,19*4-2,  (W.M. (1+2) 26th Conclusions? Minute 5).&quot;    It was thenagreed that recreation was essential for those taking their share in the war effort, and that there must &quot;be no interferencewith due facilities to this endj    and further? that there shouldhe no discrimination &quot;between different forms of sport.      TheWar Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were that while no change was called for in the general policy hitherto pursued?  some furtherintensification of that policy was called for?  e.g. by reducing still further, the number of race meetings etc. held.Before the war? the average number of days racing in aseason was 330.      This was cut down to 152 days in 19*4-0 andhas since been reduced to 67 in 19^+3.      Steeple-chasing, whichhad an average of 270 days a year before the war? has beenaltogether stopped.      Greyhound racing has been brought down from lOh meetings per annum on each track to 52.      Footballhas been re-organised on a regional basis?  so as to remove the incentive to long distance travel? with the exception of a fewspecial matches each season? such as the Internationals and - -the Cup Final, &quot;but no other limitation has been imposedbeyond the restriction of all but unimportant matches to^Saturdays and holidays.      Thus horse-racing has already
sufferer7, greater reductions than other comparable sports..This has been clue, not to any desire to discriminate against racing as such, lout to the transport problems involved.To minimise these problems,  racing has been divided between three areas,  viz. north of the Trent for horsestrained in that area,  with meetings at Stockton andPontefract;    south of the Trent for horses trained inthat areas,with meetings at Ascot, Windsor and Salisbury;and at Newmarket for horses trained at Newmarket,    iviove-ment of horses between these areas is not allowed exceptfor the open races,  eight in each half of the season, all of which are run at Newmarket.    All movement of horsesis by road and consequently, from the railway point ofview, the only factor is the conveyance of spectators.As no special facilities are provided for the transport ofspectators either by road or rail the only problemconfronting the railways is that of handling additionalcrowds on stations and trains on race days, not that ofproviding more trains or more rolling stock.Compared with other forms of sport, attendances at racemeetings are not on a large scale.    An attendance of hOyOOOis allowed as a normal figure for football and otheroutdoor sports in the less vulnerable areas (see civil defence Committee Minutes of 23rd September,   1943j(C.D.C. (A\3) 13th Meeting, Hi nut e 1)).,  and more than onematch or meeting may take place in the same area on thesame, day.    Still larger attendances are from time to timeallowed for football,  e.g.  90,000 on several occasionsat Wembley and as many as 135*000 has been agreed for aGlasgow match, though these figures do not necessarilymean actual attendances.    On the other hand,  the figures given by the Jockey Club of persons who paid for admissionare an average of 13; 6:1+1 for two meetings this season atAscot,  (one a Bank Holiday) and at Stockton an average forthree meetings (one a Bank Holiday) of 21,597.    The openraces, i.e. those which in peacetime attracted the largest number of spectators, are confined to Newmarket,&apos;andthere the average attendance for the seven days of thecurrent season is reported by the Stewards to&apos;be 5,783,of which 1,098 were members of H.M. Forces.    In considering these&quot;figures, however, allowance must&quot;be made for spectatorswho -do not enter the enclosures. Thus. at Ascot on &quot;&quot;hit 11   lay,HI V-C
1943? there were something like 25,000 people on the heathin addition to the 13?000 who paid for admission;    hut a bank Holiday figure is not typical and it is understood that many came &quot;by &quot;bicycle or in horse-drawn vehicles.One fixture calls for special attention, viz.,  theNewmarket Meeting arranged for the l6th/7th June, 19hk,- Friday and Saturday^      It has &quot;been the general practice tohold the Newmarket Meetings mid-week, and this probablyaccounts to some extent for the small attendances recorded.As an exception it was agreed that a Meeting might he heldon these dates,  he Oaks and Queen Mary being run on the Pridthe Derby and Coventry on the Saturday.      Last year&apos;s figures were June 18th 1943 (Oaks, Coronation Cup, Queen Mary) -5,kk0 and Saturday, June 19th (Derby,  Coventry) - 9,8014..It is difficult to estimate what these attendancesactually represent in additional passengers, and still moredifficult to set them against the numbers who travel to attenother forms of sport,  which take place as a rule in morepopulous areas,    but where the courses are av/ay from thelarge towns it is reasonable to suppose that a larger proportion of spectators come by train, and in particularthat meetings near the Metropolis, - such as Ascot and Windsor,are likely to mean heavy passenger traffic on the suburbanlines.      It is prirna facie unlikely that long distancetravel is involved.I may mention incidentally that according to press reports horse-racing has recently been resumed in Moscow!My personal view is that on balance the case forfurther restrictions is not strong, but I thought that Ishould let my colleagues know the position.      The matter is one in which in present circumstances there might easily be a minor Parliamentary storm.H.M.Home Office and.Ministry of Home Securit3^Whitehall, S.W.1.9th June, 19kk
