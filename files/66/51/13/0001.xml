(44) 313.llth June, 1944.WAR CABINET.OIL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.Report of the Special Oil Committee.We were appointed by the Prime Minister consequent on the Conclusions ofthe War Cabinet at their Meeting on the 31st May (W.M. (44) 70th Conclusions,Minute 1) v. (a) To carry out further examination of the draft Memorandum of Under-standing (Appendix A to the Report of the Ministerial Oil Commit-tee (W.P. (44) 269)) which has resulted from the negotiations whichhave taken place in Washington on the official level between the UnitedKingdom and United States Delegations, in the light of the points raised by the Lord Privy Seal in his Memorandum to the War Cabinet(WP. (44) 281) and of the discussion in the War Cabinet on the31st May; and(b) To consider on what level the further discussions with the United StatesGovernment in this matter should be conducted.We have held five meetings, under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. The Lord Privy Seal, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secre-tary of State for India, the Minister of War Transport, the Minister of Stateand the Chairman of the Oil Control Board were present at all our meetings, andwe have also had the advantage of the advice of Sir William Brown, Leader ofthe Official United Kingdom Delegation to Washington, on certain points arisingout of the discussions which took place in the United States.. We set out below the heads under which we thought that the matters referredto us might most conveniently be considered and our recommendations upon them :-1. The one-sided nature of the arrangements embodied in the draft Memorandumof Understanding and the importance of both parties entering whateverarrangement may be come to on equal terms.We have reviewed this important issue in all its aspects. In the result weare satisfied that the arrangements embodied in the Memorandum of Understand-ing in its present form are in fact open to objection from this jpoint of view. if his Majesty&apos;s Government are to be parties to the Understanding proposed, wethink it essential that the balance be redressed.We recommend in these circumstances that to Article, 1(3) of the draft memorandum of Understanding there should be added the words &quot;with due regard to the right of each country to draw from the production in its territories,[27635] BTOP SECRET. / Copy-No.. . ^WP. 313. \ /5 P&apos;
or in which rights are held by its nationals, to the extent that may be considered necessary.&quot; This addition will give us in terms a right to draw from suchproduction the oil requirements of our territories, and so will place us on alooting corresponding to that enjoyed by the United States under the terms ofthe draft Memorandum of Understanding. While redressing existinginequalities, it will not interfere with the general purpose of the Memorandumof Understanding, which is to regulate the distribution of oil through theinternational market.The addition which we recommend to Article I (3) would give us certain specific rights. It would not follow that we should necessarily and in all circum-stances insist on exercising these rights to the full. But we should be placed ina strong bargaining position. It would no doubt be very difficult in practice to exclude the United States oil interests from Empire markets, or perhaps even to reduce substantially the extent of their present control of distributionarrangements in those markets. The matter is, however, of the gravest conse-quence from our point of view. To the extent to which the Americans retainthose rights, we ought certainly to be in a position to claim counter-balancingconcessions from them in other areas. But the matter goes further than that.Our post-war exchange position may be involved, and we must be free without any suggestion of bad faith to look at our oil commitments from that point of view.The presence of the words now proposed to be added to Article I (3) should, wethink, sufficiently safeguard our position if in the ensuing discussions ourdelegates take occasion to make clear to the Americans the reasons why we mustpress for their insertion. We think they should also make it clear at the sametime that we cannot agree to any arrangement which would debar us fromcompeting for a larger share in the world&apos;s oil market than&apos; we enjoyat present, pointing out in this connection that, while the memorandum is designed to embody an arrangement between the United Kingdom(including the Colonial Empire) and the United States, and does not purportto commit the Dominion Governments, we have obligations to the dominions in the matter of defence and wider Empire responsibilities which will nodoubt emerge more positively at the time of the discussion of a general agreement.If it should prove impossible to secure American acceptance of the additionto Article I (3) which is now proposed, or to cover this point satisfactorily inany other way, it will be of the highest importance that the negotiations shouldnot break down on any issue other than economic and military security.While we recommend action on the lines proposed, the Minister of War-Transport wishes us to record that he is apprehensive that by using over oil the argument that we are equitably entitled to a larger share in the worldoil market than we at present enjoy, we shall give the United States the oppor-tunity to use a corresponding argument to our disadvantage over shipping. he feels that the adoption over oil of the line now proposed would seriously prejudicehis negotiations over shipping, and he would himself, had the matter been an openone, have preferred to face certain risks over oil on the basis of the original draft memorandum of Understanding. The Minister of State wishes us to record that, in his judgment, the arguments which the Minister of War Transportrelates to shipping are equally relevant to any sphere such as communications and insurance in which we have at present the same kind of advantage over the americans as they have over us in oil.2. The Open Door.We have carefully considered the arguments for and against maintaining the&quot; open door &quot; for oil in British territory. We are informed that, save in the caseof India, the open door for exploration or development of oil has for many years been the accepted policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that that policy has been based on consideration of the value to us of freedom of access to oil-producing territories outside the Empire. We are satisfied also on the evidence available to us that in terms of skill of personnel and quality of machinery weshould on merits be able to face competition in our own territories. We do not recommend in these circumstances that the policy of the open door should bere considered.We asked the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider whether the mainten-ance of the policy of the open door represents any threat to our special interests inKoweit oil. He informs us that he thinks it would be desirable, after the word&quot; that &quot; in Article I (6) to insert the words &quot;subject always to considerations ofmilitary security.&quot; We support this proposal. We deal &quot;in paragraph 7 belowwith the position of our pre-emptive rights in Koweit oil.
3. The Cartel aspect of the draft Memorandum of Understanding and itsconsistency with the line we have taken over Article VII.We have carefully considered whether objection need be taken to thisagreement either on the ground that it presents some of the features of a cartel,or because of any possible inconsistency with the line which we have taken overArticle VII. We consider in the result that these issues need not be pursued.We would point out that the members of the Petroleum Commission proposedto be established under the Memorandum of Understanding would be appointedby the two Governments, which would thus be in a position to keep the situation/ under review, to consider any evidence that may be produced regarding( prejudicial practices and to study methods of safeguarding the interests ofthe consumer.4. Should not any understanding in respect of oil he negotiated only as part ofa general understanding which would also deal with matters such as tinand rubber, in regard to xohich we enjoy a stronger position than in thecase of oil?We are of opinion, after careful examination of this matter, that the questionof oil can safely continue to be dealt with on merits and in isolation and neednot be held up for negotiation as part of a general understanding. We take note that there is nothing in Article VII which necessitates arrangements cover-ing all commodities, though that Article contemplates that there shall be commodityarrangements providing for the different circumstances of each commodity, with provision for the arrangements in respect of individual commodities beingmade to conform to a general international overriding agreement if andwhen such an agreement should be concluded. Any arrangement in respect of oil would therefore have to be made to conform to any such general overridingagreement as might be made.5. Mutual Guarantee of Concessions.The Memorandum of Understanding (Article I (5) of Appendix A toWP. (44) 269) provides &apos;&apos; that the Government of each country and the nationalsthereof shall respect all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rightsand shall make no effort unilaterally to interfere directly or indirectly with such contracts or rights.&quot; We are informed that it proved impossible in negotiationto persuade the United States authorities to go beyond the provisions of thisArticle. But we are satisfied after discussion, in the first place that any arrange-ment for mutual guarantees might alarm other nations and, in particular, beunsuitable in relation to the multilateral arrangements to which the presentpreliminary arrangement is designed to lead up, and, secondly, that the- wording of Article I (5) as it stands may be regarded as adequately safeguarding ourposition.6. Military Considerations.The question of oil involves military issues of first-eiass importance inrelation in particular to our rights of blockade and our belligerent rights, andwe have been at pains to consider the adequacy from this point of view of theprovisions of the draft Memorandum of Understanding, and the extent to which those provisions require supplementing from the point of view of military security.We were informed that at the penultimate discussion with the United Statesnegotiators the Chairman of the United States Delegation reminded bothDelegations that with respect to anything that had been discussed between them,whether formally or informally, &quot; where military necessity dictated a certain^ policy, this policy would take precedence over anything that might have beenC agreed in the course of these discussions.&quot; The United Kingdom Delegationexpressed their agreement with this view, and added that they had not only no desire, but no authority, to agree to or recommend anything that would run counter to policies predicated upon military requirements. While the statement whichwe have just quoted does not form part of the Memorandum of Understanding,,it is formally recorded in the agreed&apos; Minutes of the discussions that took placem Washington, and we feel that were any question to arise as to the constructionof the Memorandum of Understanding it could reasonably be claimed that itshould, be taken as part of the interpretation of the document.We are not, however, satisfied that even so the position is sufficientlyprotected, and given the importance of the military position we regard it as[27635] b 2
desirable to add words to protect it beyond question. We accordingly recommendthat in Article I (3) of the draft Memorandum of Understanding at Appendix Ato W.P. (44) 269 for the words &quot; subject to the provisions of such collective security arrangements as may be established &quot; there should be substituted thewords &quot; subject, however, always to considerations of military security.&quot;We are satisfied that the position in relation to rights of blockade, economic warfare and our belligerent rights generally would be fully safeguarded by an amendment in these terms and that in face of it neutrals would have no plausiblegrounds for saying that we were pledged to allow them petroleum in adequatevolume even in war time.We recognise that the amendment may encounter criticism on the groundthat it deletes the reference in the Memorandum as drafted to a world based oncollective security and that it substitutes words which very clearly contemplateconditions of military insecurity and the possibility of war. We feel thatthe importance of securing our military interests and of leaving no ground forany misunderstanding on the part of neutrals must, however, be the governingconsideration. We note that military security does not rule out, and might indeedinclude, collective security. We recommend at the same time, partly by way of meeting the criticism to which we have just referred, partly because thesuggestion has been put forward by.the Government of the Commonwealth ofAustralia, the addition to Clause 4 of the Preamble of the draft Memorandumof Understanding of the words &apos;&apos; and in order to serve the ends of collective security.&quot; That addition will in no way, in our judgment, weaken the force ofthe protective words which we propose to substitute in Article 1, Clause 3, and itwill give us an answer to criticisms of the nature which we have just discussed.7. Desirability of a mutual understanding to be embodied in the Memorandum asto the making of oil available in time of war to each party from theresources of the other.We-have felt some doubt as to whether this matter in fact properly fallswithin the scope of our terms of reference. We have, however, considered it,with particular reference to our rights of pre-emption in the case of Koweit, towhich reference has already been made in Section 2 above. We fully accept thatit is essential that nothing in any arrangement accepted by us should admit ofbeing construed as prejudicing our pre-emptive rights in Koweit or in other similar areas. We recommend that on the resumption of negotiations our repre-sentatives should specifically refer to the Koweit position and ask the United Statesnegotiators to agree to have it put on record that the Memorandum of Under-standing covers our full pre-emptive rights in the terms of the governingagreements in Koweit and other similar territories, and that our existing rights in respect of the development of resources, the location of reserves, &amp;c, are equallyprotected.8. Suggestion that the Memorandum of Understanding might be read as repre-senting the adoption by the United States and the United Kingdom of adictatorial altitude in the matter of oil which took insufficient account ofthe rights of our A Hied and other consumer countries.We are informed by the Foreign Office that the interested Allied and neutral countries have already received from the State Department a note embodying the gist of the proposals contained in the draft Memorandum of Understanding.We do not ourselves feel that the criticism under consideration can properly be urged against the Memorandum, which is, after all, designed to lead up to a multilateral agreement. The Memorandum, moreover, in Article IV (2) providesspecifically for collaboration with other producing and consuming countries.9. Suggestion that the Memorandum, as it stands, might prevent the sale of oilat a depreciated sterling price.We are informed by Sir William Brown that the words &apos;&apos; relevant economic factors &apos;&apos; in the preamble to the draft Memorandum of Understanding were included, in agreement with the United States Delegation, with the object, inter alia, of covering the position as regards foreign exchange, and that this is on record in the agreed minutes of the discussions. We are of the opinion that theposition is adequately protected.10. Freedom for the British Empire to apply tariff or quota protection to BritishEmpire oil.We find nothing in the draft Memorandum of Understanding which would interfere with any power of this nature that could legitimately be exercised, and
the words, the addition of which we have recommended in Section 1 above to article I (3) of the draft Memorandum, in our judgment, sufficiently protect theposition. We recommend, however, that our negotiators should make it clear onthe resumption of discussions that our right, in relation to oil, to resort to anyfiscal methods compatible with any international arrangements for the time being in force remains intact; and that the Memorandum of Understanding does not,apart from any wider international arrangement, curtail in any way our freedomof action for securing this end.11.   International claims in relation to oil from Iraq.The First Lord of the Admiralty has, at our request, considered with his advisers whether any special safeguard should be embodied in the Memorandumwith respect to our oil interests under the Iraq petroleum concession. Headvises us that, having regard to the amendments already proposed to be made(Section 2 and Section 6 above) in Article I (3) and Article I (6) of theMemorandum of Understanding, no further safeguards are necessary.12. When our discussions had reached an advanced stage we received aletter from the Minister of Labour, a copy of which is appended to this Report.^The point raised by the Minister of Labour is, of course, one of great importance.But as he recognises, it raises a principle that goes far beyond oil, and applies to other important coimnodities in international demand. We do not feel, inthe circumstances, that it falls properly within our terms of reference. But we desire to bring it to the notice of the War Cabinet; and we suggest that in framing the instructions to the British Government representatives as to theline to be taken by them in discussions leading up to the establishment of anywider international body, close attention should be paid to the provisions to bemade in such wider arrangement for safeguarding the interests of countries whichare primarily consuming countries.Our Recommendation.13. Subject to the amendments which we have recommended in our report,we are of the opinion that exception need not be taken to the terms of the draft memorandum of Understanding, and that negotiations with the United StatesGovernment on the basis of that Memorandum should now go forward.14. We have set out above the amendments which in the opinion of us all should be made if, as contemplated by the Cabinet at their meeting on the31st May (W.M. (44) 70th Conclusions, Minute 1) discussions proceed withthe United States Government on the basis of the draft Memorandum of understanding.15. The Lord Privy Seal, the First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for India have, however, asked us to add an expression of theirmisgivings as to an agreement aimed, on the lines of a cartel, at stabilisation ofthe production and distribution of oil throughout the world with the UnitedStates, with its dominant position in oil production and distribution. whilst the amendments inserted to protect our military security (see Section 2 and section 6 above), if accepted by the United States, would cover our military needs, they think it desirable to emphasise to the Cabinet the importance of ourmaking every effort to secure greater freedom for the British Empire to expandits production and markets.16. Basis for conduct of negotiations with the United States Government.The War Cabinet invited us to consider on what level the further discussionsAvith the United States Government should be conducted. We are of opinionthat it is now desirable to aim at finality in this matter, and that the discussion would appropriately take place therefore on a Ministerial level. We do not regard it as within our province to make a specific recommendation as to the precise nature of our representation in these discussions, or as to the connectedarrangements.J. A.&apos; Chairman.(On behalf of the Special Oil Committee.)Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,14th June, 1944.* Annex.
ANNEX.Copy of a Letter to the Chairman from the Minister of Labour, and national Service.Now that the Special Committee on Oil has been set up I should like todraw your attention to an aspect of this matter which has been exercising my mind for some time.  This is the position of the user countries. VThe United States Government and ourselves are to propose that an inter-national conference of the peaceable countries, interested as producers orconsumers, should be convened for the purpose of negotiating an international agreement which would provide for a Permanent International PetroleumCouncil composed of representatives of ail Governments who are parties to theagreement.I have considerable doubt whether a Council of this kind would work well inpractice, and it might be found that better results would be secured by having itdivided into two sections, one representing producers and the other the consumers. But, in any event, it seems necessary to have special provision forprotecting the interests of the consumers, particularly the small nations. Forthis purpose I should like to see established some means of appeal to anindependent fact-finding body which would investigate any nation&apos;s claim thatits position was being prejudiced by the action or decisions of the InternationalCouncil.  Ultimately this machinery should be linked with the world organisation.I recognise that the principle goes far beyond oil and applies to other important commodities in international demand. In this connection you will remember that, in the course of the Article VII talks on Commodity Policy, itwas recognised as a fundamental principle in the composition of commodityorganisations that importing countries should have a combined vote equal to the exporting countries. The appointment of independent members was alsocontemplated. But without some form of appeal such as I have suggested, theissue becomes in the last resort a political one to be settled between ForeignOffices. With appeal machinery which would afford user nations a right to be heard judicially and to ventilate their grievances, the danger arising from thecartelisation of the raw materials by the Great Powers would be minimised.I should be glad to know what you think about this.I am also a little concerned about the period which might elapse betweenthe setting up of the Joint Anglo-American Commission and the establishmentof the International Council and organisation. The need for safeguardingconsumer interest&apos;is a strong argument for ensuring that the interval should be short, and I feel sure that we shall run into serious difficulties unless this is recognised. The draft Memorandum of Understanding says that the proposalsfor an International Agreement will be made as soon as practicable, but I wouldbe glad to know exactly what the intention is.I am sending a copy of this letter to Eden.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service,St. James&apos;s Square, S.W. 1,7th June, 1944.
