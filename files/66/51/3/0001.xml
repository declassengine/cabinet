THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 303.1th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AVIATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies.   JAS members of the Committee which has been appointed by the Cabinet to concern itself with the question of Civil Air Transport, we feel bound strongly to support the plea which has been advanced by the Lord Privy Seal in favourof the immediate transfer of responsibility for Civil Aviation from the AirMinistry to the Ministry of War Transport.In his papernhe Lord Privy Seal has gone into considerable detail. We donot propose to follow him there. We are concerned rather with the broad issues.Our experience has driven us to the conclusion that the present machinery willnot work. Under the existing set-up the responsibility for policy, in reality if notin name, rests with the Lord Privy Seal, as Chairman of the C.A.T. Committee.But the department which must operate that policy, the Director-General ofCivil, Aviation and his subordinates, are not under him. They form part of theAir Ministry and are responsible to another Minister, the Secretary of Statefor Air. That is an impossible position. To say this implies no reflection either on the Air Ministry or on the Secretary of State himself. But clearly, if anycoherent policy is to be evolved for post-war Civil Aviation, as for any othersphere of public policy, a single minister must have the ultimate responsibility to the Cabinet and to Parliament. Divided responsibility can only lead to delay,indecision and lack of grip. And that is ,in fact what has happened and is happening, as can clearly be seen from.the.Lord.Privy seal&apos;s paper. We arefalling behind in the race with other nations and in particular with the UnitedStates. This is in particular true of the provision of aircraft. It is, in our view,no exaggeration to say that a few more months of the present ineffective machinerymay fatally impair the ability of this country to retain its proper share of thecivil air transport services of the world in the years following the war.It may be argued that the proper remedy for the present unhappy situationis to restore the entire control of Civil Air Transport to the Air Ministry; and.indeed that would no doubt in many ways be better than the existing position.But we are convinced that a Service Department is, by its very nature, not fitted to discharge this particular responsibility. It might equally be argued that thecontrol of the merchant marine should be remitted to the Admiralty. Yet noone suggests that. And why? Because everyone knows perfectly well that theoutlook of the Admiralty is not commercial, and that of the merchant, marine is.And if is this commercial outlook which is the essential factor for success, in civilaviation as in merchant shipping. The job of civil aviation is to create a market for its commodity, not only by safety and punctuality, but by taking every possible step to sell itself to the public. It must have the attitude of the shopman to hiscustomer. That is the commercial outlook. It is the outlook which mustpresumably animate the Ministry of Transport. It is emphatically not theoutlook of a British Service Department, nor do we believe that it is an outlookthat a Service Department can acquire.We wish very much that this issue could have been postponed until afterthe war. We fully recognise the difficulty of disentangling the wartime and post-war aspects of air transport. But we do not believe that the decision isone that can be put off. The struggle for the control of the post-war air hasalready begun.   The great American interests are already staking out their&quot;[27606]Copy No. d)
claims all over the world. The development of an effective British civil aviationis of major importance from the Empire aspect. The Dominions are lookinganxiously to us for a lead. If they do not soon receive some evidence of our ability and determination to give such a lead, they will be driven to make thebest terms they can individually with the United States, for they cannot afford to fall behind. We cannot believe that the problem of staffing an efficient civilaviation department under the Ministry of Transport is insoluble, and we urgemost strongly on the Government the necessity of such a step as a matter of high urgency, affecting both our imperial and our international position in theyears to come.. O. S.7th June, 1944. &apos;
