Prime Minister to President Roosevelt. No. 896.   9.6.44.Personal and Top Secret.1. I want to know your wishes about the notes issued for the troops inFrance. Eisenhower has urgent need to make a proclamation announcing it.De Gaulle is quite ready to make a supporting proclamation, but there is reasonto expect he will press for his proclamation to contain the words &quot; ProvisionalGovernment of France&quot; or &quot; of the French Republic &quot; and publish it in the&apos;r Official Journal of the French Republic &quot; which he produces at Algiers. Weshall naturally endeavour to- persuade him to stick to the French Committeeof National Liberation but.he fights at every point. The Treasury fear that ifhe does not endorse the issue, the notes will have ho backing behind them andalternatively I feel that Eisenhower&apos;s proclamation will commit our twoGovernments jointly or separately to redeem them. How does this stand inyour mind?2. Others even say that he might denounce the notes as false money. Ido not myself think that he will dare. I should myself think, if I were a Frenchshopkeeper, that a note printed in the United States tendered to me by a british or American soldier and declared legal by General Eisenhower was well worthhaving whether de Gaulle endorsed it or not.3. Would you please let me know what is your view ? Shall we get de Gaulleto take responsibility for these notes as President of the Provisional Governmentof France, in which case the French Nation will ultimately face the problemof redeeming them&apos;? Or shall we say the United States and Great Britain assume responsibility for these notes and will fix the ultimate responsibility at the peace settlement?   I should be srrateful for an early  answer.Prime Minister to. President Roosevelt. No. 697.   10.6.44.Personal and Top Secret.1. Further to my No. 696. I have now seen the specimens of the notes inquestion. They do not strike us as very reassuring. They look very easy to forge.Nothing is said on whose responsibility they are issued and who is responsiblefor redeeming them.  Surely there must be some authority behind them.2. These views expressed, after seeing the notes affect paragraph 2 of myNo. 696 and make it all the more necessary that someone should take responsi-bility for meeting&quot; them when they are presented. Please; my dear friend, look at them for yourself and say what we ought to do. Should we let de Gaulle obtainnew status as his price for backing these notes or should we take the burden onourselves for the time being and improve the issue later on and settle up at thePeace Table where there will be many accounts to be presented ?President Roosevelt to Prime Minister. No. 5$9.   13.6.44.Personal and Top Secret.I share your view that this currency issue is being exploited to stampede us into according full recognition to the Comite. Personally I do not think the currency situation referred to in your cable is as critical as it might first appear,nor do I feel that it is essential from the point of view^ of the acceptability ofthe supplemental currency that de Gaulle make any statement of support withrespect to&apos; such currency. I propose that de Gaulle should be informed asfollows : 1. We intend to continue to use the supplementary franc currency inexactly the same manner as we have planned and as we have agreed with theBritish Treasury and as has been fully understood by. Messrs. Monnet andMendes-France of the French Comite.2. If for any reason the supplementary currency is not acceptable to theFrench public, General Eisenhower has full authority to use yellow seal dollarsand British Military authority notes.&apos; Accordingly, if de Gaulle incites theFrench people into refusing to accept supplementary francs then the Comite willhave to bear the full responsibility for any bad effects resulting from the use ofyellow seal notes and BMA notes in France. One of the certain consequenceswill be the depreciation of the French franc in terms of dollars and sterling ina black market which will accentuate and reveal the weaknesses of the Frenchmonetary system. This is one of the important reasons why we accepted the[27645]&apos;
request of the French Comite that we not use yellow seal dollars and BMA notesas a spearhead currency. There would be other adverse effects which would beapparent to de Gaulle and his advisers. I would certainly not importunede Gaulle to make any supporting statement whatever regarding the currency.Provided it be clear that he acts entirely on hisown responsibility and without our concurrence he can sign any statement on currency in whatever capacity helikes, even that of the King of Spain.As far as the appearance of the notes is concerned, I have seen them before,but I have looked at them again and think them adequate. I am informed bythe Bureau of Engraving and Printing Counterfeiting experts that they wall be extremely difficult to counterfeit by virtue of the intricate colour combination.I am also informed that the British Treasury officials approved the note and thatthe French representatives here not only approved the note but were satisfied with the designs and the color.It seems clear that Prima Donnas do not change their spots.
