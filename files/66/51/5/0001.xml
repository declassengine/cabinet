FRANCE.(An outline map of the area and a map giving the dispositions of german divisions are included as insets.)1. Operations which began early on the 6th have for their &quot;object the securing of a lodgment on the Continent from which further offensive operationscan be developed. The assault was made on a five-divisional front in landingships and landing craft in the Baie de la Seine, west of Havre.2. An air bombardment of the coastal batteries in the area commencedshortly after 2300 on the 5th and continued throughout the hours of darkness,over 5,000 tons of bombs being dropped. In support of the assault a bombard-ment force operated consisting of six battleships, two monitors, 22 cruisers,two gunboats and 91 destroyers.3. Airborne forces were dropped during darkness in the early morning ofthe 6th, U.S. troops in the S.E. of the Cotentin Peninsula, where they capturedSte. Mere Eglise and St. Martin, and British troops to the east of the River Orne,where they captured intact two bridges over the river at Ranville. About 1,300transport aircraft and 147 gliders were employed in this operation, which wasreinforced on the evenings of the 6th and 7th when over 1,000 transport aircraft and a large number of gliders were employed; 33 transport aircraft are missingfrom these operations.4. The attack was launched by a Western (TJ.S.) and Eastern (British) TaskForce upon adjacent sectors. The assault forces, with the follow-up forces whicharrived p.m. on the 7th, were carried by 2,154 landing ships and craft, with a totallift of 159,595 men and 16,715 vehicles. Escorting the assault forces and earlyconvoys were 165 sloops, escort destroyers, frigates, corvettes and patrol craft.Sixteen destroyers and 50 coastal craft gave cover to the approach of the assaultforces, and four A/S groups operated in the approaches to the Channel. Inaddition, continuous air cover was provided and over 4,000 fighter sorties were flown on the 6th. Over 1,500 minor landing craft and barges maintained aferry service between the lowering position and the beaches. The approachchannels for the assault forces were swept by ten minesweeping flotillas, andother minesweeping flotillas were attached to the bombarding forces. Auxiliaryminesweepers swept wide channels parallel to the beaches. Cover within thechannel but outside the assault area was provided by 16 destroyers and83M.T.Bs. ,5. At 0630 on the morning of the 6th seaborne landings commenced on the eastside of the Cherbourg Peninsula and between the Rivers Vire and Orne. Mostof the shore batteries were put out of action by the preliminary bombardment,and opposition was in general less than was expected. Three diversionaryoperations were carried out without incident. The assault forces met with little opposition from surface craft. Three torpedo-boats and some armed trawlersfrom Havre were driven off with the loss of one enemy trawler sunk and anotherdamaged. The U.S. seaborne landing on the east side of the Cherbourg Peninsulaachieved complete surprise, and initially met with little opposition. In theVierville area enemy mining near the beaches caused a number of landing-craftto be capsized or stranded, and in this area and the adjacent St. Laurent areaheavy seas and stiff shore opposition held up the initial landings. Some of the beaches became very congested, and bombing and occasional shellfire impededdeliveries. After, heavy fighting U.S. troops established a small bridgeheadwhich is 3-5 miles deep and includes St. Laurent, Colleville and Trevieres.6. Further to the east, in the British sector between Arromanches and theRiver Orne, the weather seriously hindered the rate of discharge and it wasdecided to hasten unloading by large-scale beaching of tank landing ships; inthe 24 hours ending 2300 on the 7th, 21,400 men, 3,200 vehicles and 2,500 tonsof stores,were unloaded in this area. Our forces cleared all beaches of the enemy and secured a bridgehead approximately 25 miles wide and ten miles deep. the initial opposition to these landings was patchy but inland fighting has generallybeen heavy.7- Bayeux was captured on the 7th and at 1100 hours our line ranapproximately through Bayeux-south of Bayeux-Caen road to Norrey-en-Bessin-Epron-Herouville-Bures-Franceville-Plage. At 0700 on the 8th no materialchanges to this line had been reported.  Caen has not yet been captured.
IS8. On the 6th and 7th Allied aircraft maintained continuous attacks on enemy targets on and around the beaches, on towns, villages and camps southof the beaches, and on bridges, roads and railways in the Cherbourg, Caen,Amiens and Rouen areas, 7,500 tons of bombs being dropped and many rocketprojectiles fired. On the night of the 6th/7th, 3,100 tons were dropped on railway and road junctions south of the assault area and 571 tons on railway junctionsat Chateaudun and Acheres near Paris. On the following night 800 tons were dropped on troop and M.T. concentrations in the Foret de Cerisy, north-east of st. Lo, and 1,130 tons on four railway junctions near Paris.9. On the 6th hostile air activity was not on a large scale, but has sincesomewhat increased. On the night of the 7th/8th about 150 enemy aircraft were reported to be operating on and over the beaches.10. In connection with this operation, according to reports so far received,14,784 sorties were flown by the A.E.A.F. (including airborne operations),6,537 by the Eighth U:S. Air Force, and 3,175 by Bomber Command. enemy casualties were 130 aircraft destroyed, 19 probably destroyed and 40 damaged;280 Allied bombers and fighters are missing.Apart from H.M.S. Roberts (monitor), both of whose 15-inch guns were putout of action, there has been no serious casualty among the heavier ships. On the night of the 7th/ 8th E-boats from Cherbourg and torpedo boats from Havre wereactive. H.M. destroyer Obedient drove off four E-boats north-west of Dieppe and h.M. destroyer Vanquisher drove off others which approached a convoy.11. Convoys passing through the Strait of Dover have been engaged by enemy coastal batteries. On the 6th the British s.s. Sambut (7,219 tons) was sunk off the South Foreland. There were approximately 430 survivors. Other casualtiesso far reported, exclusive of landing craft, are :  ^The U.S. troopship Susan B. Anthony (8,101 tons) sunk, and the U.S.S.Francis B. Harrington mined, in the assault area; the U.S. blockship WestHonaker torpedoed by aircraft; the U.S. destroyer Corry sunk off the beachesby &quot;gunfire and the Norwegian destroyer Svenner sunk off Le Havre; H.M.S.Bulolo (headquarters ship) slightly damaged by a bomb; the British hospitalcarriers Dinard (1,952 tons) and Saint Julien (2,313 tons) mined while on passage to the assault area.12. The total number of ships and craft employed, 6,483, may be comparedwith the 2,755 employed in the invasion of Sicily. British, Canadian, U.S.,French, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish and Greek warships are taking part.13. The landing of troops and seaborne military supplies continues on allbeaches with minor interference and despite the bad weather. At 1200 on the 8ththe weather was reported to be fine and improving.naval SITUATION.General Review.14.   Large Allied naval forces are operating in the Channel.Naval aircraft have successfully attacked shipping off the Norwegian coast.Norwegian Waters.15.- On the 1st, off Stadtlandet, aircraft from H.M. ships Victorious andFurious, covered by cruisers and destroyers of the Home Fleet, attacked a convoy of three-escorted ships, all of which were hit, and four of the escorts were damaged by fighters. Two of the cargo ships, the German s.s. Hans Leonhardt(4,174 tons) carrying ammunition and the German m.v. Florida (6,150 tons), anda minesweeper, were later reported to have sunk. One Corsair and one Seafireare missing.Mediterranean.16. Early in the week U.S. destroyers provided fire support in the Anzio andArdea areas. . &quot;17. Between the 30th May and the 2nd June H.M.

On the night of the 29th/30th H.M. destroyers Terpsichore, Tumult andTuscan carried out a sweep in the Adriatic and sank a caique. Two nights laterTerpsichore and Tuscan with coastal craft covered the landing of Allied forces onBrae Island until the completion of this operation. On the night of the 4th/5thtwo of H.M. destroyers bombarded Lussin Piccolo Island off Dalmatia.20. H.M. submarines operating in the .^aegean have reported as follows : Unswerving sank a caique on the 6th May.Unsparing sank two caiques and damaged others in the harbour of Kos onthe 19th.Unruly sank a caique off Crete and took four prisoners on the 30th.Sickle torpedoed and probably sank the German-controlled s.s. Orion (4,798tons) in the Doro Channel on the 6th June, Another ship was possibly torpedoed.On the night of the lst/2nd a caique was captured by coastal forces.Pacific.Dutch New Guinea.21. Allied, ships have bombarded enemy positions on Biak Island&apos; (SchoutenIslands) : on the 31st a U.S. destroyer sank three troop-laden barges and on the5th blew up an ammunition dump.Celebes Sea.22. Forces of enemy warships including battleships have been reportedbetween Mindanao and Halmahera during the week, and on the 31st some 100aircraft from carriers at Tawitawi were seen flying south. On the 5th a forceincluding, two battleships, three carriers and six cruisers, was reported inTawitawi anchorage.Anti-Submarine Operations.23. Ten attacks by shore-based aircraft have been reported during the week.One U-boat was possibly sunk west of Trondheim on the 3rd; five survivors were seen in the water.Enemy Intelligence.24. It is reported that the Tirpitz in Altenfjord is making such repairsas are essential before she can put to sea, but she will have to be docked beforeshe can be completely effective.25.   Three Seetier class destroyers have left Bordeaux for Channel ports.As a result of the air raids on Dieppe at the end of last month quaysidefacilities for loading mines have been seriously damaged. The enemy had usedDieppe intensively for his defensive minelaying operations.26. The enemy is reported to be converting in Norwegian yards craft similarto Dutch schuyt coasters to carry three torpedo tubes for coastal defence.U-boats.27. No U-boats have so far intervened in operations in the Channel, butthere has been considerable activity in the Ushant area and in the Bay of Biscay.28. A large Japanese U-boat is reported to have arrived at Pauillac at thebeginning of April with a cargo of rubber and oil. At the beginning of May itwas reported that two 1,500-ton U-boats were being loaded at Bordeaux withcargoes for Japan : these included ball-bearings probably obtained before theAllied air attacks on the ball-bearing factories, and originally meant for shipmentby surface craft.Enemy Attack on Shipping.29. Apart from the shipping losses in the Channel operations, one ship was damaged by a mine off Falmouth and one ship was sunk by U-boat in the carribbean.

Surface craft have laid jmines off the north coast of France. aircraft have laid mines in the Baltic and off the Frisian Islands, the Dutch coast, thenorth coast of France and the Biscay ports.Mines have been laid in the Danube, in Greek waters, in the iEgean and inthe Malacca Strait.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.32. Early in the week enemy aircraft were suspected of minelaying off theEast Coast.Previous to the departure of the assault forces a large dangerous area was declared south of the Isle of Wight, where 11 mines have been destroyed. Duringthe approach to the Normandy coast 25 moored mines were destroyed and h.M. destroyer Wrestler was mined and returned to port. Several lines of enemymines are believed to be in an area parallel to the coast between 12 and 18 miles off shore. Three of the approach channels, cleared and widened to about twomiles, have been established, and up to the evening of the 7th 95 mines have been destroyed in the approaches to tke assault area.A U.S. landing craft was mined on the 6th south of Hastings, where a dangerous area has been declared. Six mines have been destroyed off Brighton,two off Torbay, and six off Falmouth, where a dangerous area has been declared.More enemy minefields have been located off the north-east coast of Corsica.The mine totals are 4,833 ground and 4,807 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.33.

The s.s. MaiiaCarmen, a newcomer to this trade, has arrived at Bilbao.36. The German s.s. Gerda Toft (1,960 tons) was damaged on the 1st duringan air raid on shipping off Crete and has since been seen submerged in Candiaharbour. The ex-Italian s.s. Salvatore (2,252 tons), which was also hit, is believed to have been sunk.MILITARY SITUATIONRusso-German Campaign.37. The enemy have continued their attacks N.W. and north of Jassy, but have made little headway against strong resistance. The exact scale of the attacks is not clear, but they appear to be confined to a narrow sector of the front.North-West France.See combined report, pages 2 and 3.[27599] b 2
Italy.    (A map of Central Italy is included as an inset.)38. General Alexanders armies have pressed forward with all speed since their capture of Rome on the 4th, and the latest information is that the port of Civitavecchia is in the hands of the Fifth Army, while the Eighth Army isnow over 25 miles north of Rome.The principal occurrence which enabled us to capture Rome was the breachingof the heavily fortified enemy line Velletri-Valmontone. The operations thatled to this began to show success on the 1st, when the town of Velletri was entered.On the same day U.S. infantry forces cut Highway 6 east of Valmontone, andthe next day this town, too, was in our hands. Exploitation was swift alongHighway 6 towards Rome, and our advance in the hills was maintained untilthe enemy&apos;s defences on the Colli Laziali, the hinge on which the enemy&apos;s retreatdepended, had been deeply penetrated and completely outflanked to the north.By the 3rd, TJ.S. forces were streaming down Highway 6 in the direction of rome and early the next day reconnaissance elements of the leading formation entered the city. Stiff resistance was still being encountered by other U.S. forces north of Lanuvio, in the Genzano area, but by the 5th the whole area south of the Tiberhad been cleared and our forces were through the city and advancing up the roadin the direction of Civitavecchia.Meanwhile on the right flank, the Eighth Army, after its capture &quot;ofFrosinone, turned north-west. After the capture of Ferentino and Anagni, the axis of advance was turned further north still. Led by two armoured divisionsthe advance in the direction of Tivoli and the Tiber valley was continued. Bythe 7th our forces had reached Civita Castellana, on the road to Narni, and hadcleared Tiyoli of the enemy. The advance to Narni continues, but latest reportsspeak of some enemy opposition and many demolitions.The Fifth Army, after passing through Rome, continued the advance west and N.W. until by the 7th they had seized Campagnano, Bracciano and Civita-vecchia, thus giving them a forward line running roughly east-west 15 milesbeyond Rome.. The port of Civitavecchia is ah important gain. The advancenorth-east of Civitavecchia continues, but some opposition has been reported.More than 20,000 prisoners of war have now been counted in, since theopening of the Italian offensive on the 11th May.Yugoslavia.39. Heavy fighting has continued in Western Bosnia, where the Partisanshave succeeded in regaining some ground and in repulsing German advances.German columns have withdrawn north and N.E. from the area of Drvar; anenemy thrust southwards from Sanski Most (30 miles north of Drvar) was driven back by the Partisans.1,100 Allied troops and 2,500 Partisans landed on the Dalmatian Island ofBrae on the night of the 1st/2nd. These were reinforced on the following night.Hard fighting took place in the^western half of the island and in the vicinity of a town near the east coast. Allied troops started to withdraw on the 4th while thePartisan forces intended to remain on the island for a further short period.The Partisans claimed successes in other parts of Yugoslavia. german attacks in Montenegro and in Hercegovina have been repulsed, while the Partisanshave recaptured the town of Srebrenica in East Bosnia (50 miles N.E. of Sarajevo).Burma.Chin Hills and C hind win.40. On the 1st the Japanese who had infiltrated round our right flank in thevicinity of Bishenpur were cleared from a village 6^ miles N.E. of Bishenpur.Our efforts to cut off the enemy&apos;s infiltration, by driving westwards in the area4 miles SW. of Bishenpur, have been strongly resisted.The enemy are withdrawing from areas immediately north and east ofKohima and our troops are following up this withdrawal. South of Kohimaresistance is still strong.Chinese/A merican Forces.41. On the 31st May a Chinese column outflanked Kamaing and captureda Japanese supply column on the road about 5 miles south of Kamaing.   The
village has also been outflanked further to the west by two Chinese columnsadvancing on Manli, north of Lake Indawgyi. Troops advancing on Kamaingdown the road from the north.are within 4 miles of the village. Further smalladvances have been made in the town of Myitkyina.There has been little change in the situation on the Salween front. chinese troops in the centre of the line have made some slight advances.Pacific Theatre.   (A map of West New Guinea is included as an inset.)42. U.S. troops attacking Mokmer airfield on Biak Island were forced towithdraw a short distance on the 31st May. They subsequently regained this ground and captured the airfield on the morning of the 7th June. U.S. troops have now occupied two small islands off Biak.There has been vigorous U.S. patrol activity in the Hollandia area and numerous casualties have been inflicted on the Japanese. On the 2nd, australian troops made an unopposed landing on Karkar Island off Cape Croisilles, north of Madang.AIR SITUATION.General Review.43. Home-based aircraft flew at least 39,000 sorties during the week and gave full support to the landing operations in France. M.A.A.F. aircraft flew17,312 sorties and dropped 11,276 tons of bombs on Central and Southern Europe.In Italy, enemy communications were very effectively attacked. U.S. aircraft of the M.A.A.F. bombed targets in east Hungary and landed on Russian airfields.United Kingdom.44. No enemy reconnaissance or other aircraft flew over this country duringthe 24 hours preceding the 5th June and, from information so far received, thereis no indication that the G.A.F. was aware, on the 5th, of the Allied assaultplanned for the next day.On the night 7th/8th nine enemy intruders operated over East Angliaand three others were believed to be minelaying. Three of these aircraft were shot down.Home Waters.45. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,028 sorties duringthe week; five aircraft are missing and two enemy aircraft were destroyed.Beaufighters intercepted three enemy destroyers on passage between Bordeauxand Brest (damaging two), attacked a further three off Lorient (damaging at least one) and sank an E/R-boat off Cap Gris Nez.A group of ships, including an 800-ton minesweeper, was attacked byMosquitoes off Lorient, with good results. Two naval Avengers damaged a smallship off the Hook.Bomber Command aircraft laid .683 sea-mines.Germany and Denmark.46. A total of 138 Mosquitoes carried out small-scale attacks onLudwigshaven, Leverkusen, osnabruck and Cologne. Three Mosquitoes bombed the port area at Aarhus in Denmai\k.* France and Belgium.47. The air operations immediately concerned with the landings in Franceare described in paragraph 1 et seq.. The following relate to Operations up to2300 hours on the 5th, and involve 6,646 sorties by the A.E.A.F., 5,610 sorties bythe Eighth U.S. Air Force and 1,621 sorties by Bomber Command. EnemyTossesin combat were 14 aircraft destroyed, one probably destroyed and three damaged;* The results of some of the attacks referred to overleaf are given in Appendix VII.
forty-nine Allied bombers and 19 fighters are missing.  The distribution of effort was as follows : *(a) Rail and Road Communications. Nearly 2,400 tons were dropped onthese objectives. The main attacks were made on railway targets inthe Paris area, with good results. Attacks were also made on similarobjectives and on roads and bridges in Normandy, in the Nantes,Samur, Abbeville and Arras areas, and in Belgium. It is reportedthat most of the road and railway bridges over the River Seinebetween Rouen and Paris were destroyed or severely damaged.v&apos;b) Coastal and Railway Batteries, Defended Localities and military objectives. Over 10,200 tons of bombs were dropped on, and 104rocket projectiles were fired at, batteries and defended localities in coastal areas between Calais and Cherbourg, with results which were generally good. A further 281 tons were dropped on military objectives in the Pas De Calais and near Abbeville.(c) W/T and Radar Installations. Two attacks were made on the W/Tstation at Ferme CUrville, near Cherbourg, and one on the W/Tstation at Berneval Le Grand, near Dieppe, 955 tons of bombs being released on the former and 542 tons on the latter. About 200 tons were dropped on, and 2,151 rocket projectiles were fired at, radarinstallations between Calais and Guernsey.(d) Airfields. In daylight, 1,340 tons of bombs were dropped on 14 airfields in France, and, by night, small-scale attacks were made on many others in France and Belgium.(e) Other Targets. Daylight attacks were made on fuel dumps in Brittanyand near Paris, Amiens and Laval, on six enemy Headquarters inNorthern France and on an aircraft factory at Bourges.Italy and South France.48.   During the week ended the Qth, A Hied aircraft of the M.A .A .F. -fleiv a total of 17,312 sorties; 83 aircraft were lost and 68 enemy aircraft were destroyed.A major offensive was carried out against enemy communications, and air operations were continued on similar lines to those of the previous weeks.A particular concentration of effort was made against road and railway bridges which were attacked throughout Central Italy by numerous fighters andbombers, including on one day a force of over 160 heavy bombers; resultsgenerally were very satisfactory and many hits were reported.In the earlier part of the week fighter-bombers and bombers carried outfrequent attacks on troop concentrations, dumps an)d roads to the south of rome. Heavy bombers attacked the railway centres at Genoa and Turincausing considerable damage to rolling-stock and also bombed the Antheorviaduct and the railway bridge over the Var River; although many very near misses were reported, it is doubtful if these latter targets were hit. In a subsequent raid hits were obtained and both targets were damaged.After the occupation of Rome by Allied troops on the 4th, roads and rail-ways and communications north of the city were heavily and systematicallyattacked. Heavy bombers bombed five railway bridges in the north of Italy,also Bologna and four other railway centres and obtained many direct hits.Enemy road and railway transport and troop movements were attacked on allpossible occasions and at least 1,608 M/T vehicles were destroyed and 1,319others were damaged; in a two-week period over 6,500 enemy vehicles were eitherdestroyed or damaged as a result of air attack.Allied losses in the vicinity of the battle area were 32 fighters and sevenbombers. Six enemy aircraft were shot down. Our complete ascendancy inthe air enabled our land forces to continue their advance almost free from enemyinterference.R.P. Hurricanes flew anti-shipping patrols off the west coast and sank two -boats, four schooners and seven other small craft west of Marseilles.Beaufighters attacked a ship of 2,000 tons which was seen to explode.&quot;Yugoslavia.49. Fighter-bombers, on a considerable scale, flew offensive reconnaissancesin support of the Partisans, in the area of Bangaluka, Bihac, Mostar and Zara.Thirty-nine M/T vehicles, seven locomotives and 80 railway cars were destroyed,
and about 80 M/T vehicles, nine locomotives and 180 railroad cars were damaged.A direct hit was made on the German H.Q. at Brae, and enemy ground positionswere attacked.   Six coastal vessels and two siebel ferries were damaged.Bombing attacks by a total of 74 Liberators and 54 Baltimores were made onSplit and Gmis, and Mrkjonic Grad (80 miles N.W. of Sarajevo) and Banjalukawere bombed by Baltimores and Marauders.Wellingtons and Liberators laid 129 mines in the River Danube.The decline in the G.A.F. activity against the Partisan forces is no doubtdirectly attributable to the considerable losses of aircraft on the ground sustained in the successful Allied raids of the last fortnight.Rumania and Hungary.50. Over 800 Liberators bombed oil refineries and the railway centre atPloesti, dropping 609 tons; hits were obtained on the refineries and considerable damage was caused to rolling-stock in the sidings. Liberators dropped 297 tons at the railway centre of Brasov, the target being well covered. Debreczen railway centre was bombed by 131 Liberators, escorted by 69 Mustangs, and the results are believed to have been successful; the majority of these aircraft landed atRussian bases. A total of 540 heavy bombers dropped 1,139 tons on the following-railway centres, and good concentrations were obtained: Szolnok, Miskolc,Lzeged, Simeria, Cluj, Debreczen, Oradea.At night, Wellingtons bombed the railway lines over the Iron Gates Canal,probably damaging the canal walls, the railway centre at Szolnok (58 miles S.E.of Budapest), and quays and storage tanks at Giurgiu (30 miles S. of Bucharest).In the course of these operations 21 Allied bombers are missing and 34 enemy aircraft were shot down.iEgean.51. On the 1st a convoy of three ships, escorted by four destroyers and with air cover, was attacked north of Heraklion by Marauders, Baltimores andR.P. Beaufighters. Two, and perhaps three, of the ships were seriously damaged,and three of the escort vessels were repeatedly hit with R.Ps. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed and five of ours are missing.In an attack on shipping at Heraklion on the following day one ship was sunk and another was set on fire.Russia.52. The Russian ground-attack and bomber aircraft played an important part in the repulse of German tank attacks north of Jassey. Fighter aircraft were active, and in conjunction with A.A. defences accounted for a total of atleast 75 German aircraft over the period 2nd/4th June, in this area.Russian Yak fighters provided an escort for American heavy &quot;bombers whichflew cn to bases in Russia after attacking targets in Hungary on the 2nd June.Burma.53. Allied aircraft for the week ended the 6th flew a total of 1,933 sorties;9 Allied aircraft are missing.Transport aircraft flew 1,412 sorties, carrying 2,557 tons and 3,972 men, andevacuated 475 casualties and 14 prisoners of war.Enemy positions were attacked in the Assam and Myitkyina areas.Pacific.New Guinea and the Schouten and Halmahera Islands.54. In Dutch New Guinea, frequent attacks were made by Allied aircraft on various enemy targets, including the airfields at Ransikr, on the west coast of Geelvink Bay and at Tansiki, south of Manokwari, enemy camps and supplyareas in the Maffin Bay and Sarmi areas, fuel dumps in the Babo area and coastalvillages between Hollandia and Wakde. Attacks were also made on enemy positions in support of Allied troops. At Manokwari, large fires were started in the fuel dumps and a small ship was sunk and, off Manokwari, an enemydestroyer was damaged.
In British New Guinea, bombing and machine gun attacks were made on enemy troop concentrations and supply centres in the Boram, Dagua and Wewakareas and in the Sepik River valley.In Biak Island, the largest of the Schouten Islands, Liberators, Mitchellsand Bostons bombed the Mokmer Ridges in support of Allied land-forces, and enemy positions between Bosnek and Mokmer.A total of about 55 enemy aircraft made five attacks on the beachhead onBiak Island, causing slight damage and a few casualties; 24 were destroyed by allied fighters.Off Halmahera Island, three Liberators sank one destroyer and damaged two other warships.New Britain and New Ireland.55. The town of Rabaul and the airfields nearby were again the principaltargets for Allied aircraft. At Rabaul considerable damage was caused to alarge concentration of trucks, a barge repair depot and supply centres. attacks were also made on the supply area at Talili Bay and on targets on the Duke ofYork Island.In New Ireland three attacks were made on Kavieng airfield, which was rendered temporarily unserviceable. At Namatanai large fires were started inthe supply and camp areas, and near Namatanai a jetty was destroyed.Bougainville.56. About 200 fighter-bomber sorties were flown during the week against enemy targets, including bridges, supply areas, and the airfields at Buka andRaua.  Off the coast several barges were sunk or damaged.A mbon Island.57. The airfield and other targets near Liang were successfully bombed three times by a total of 23 Liberators and nine Catalinas.Guam and Wake Islands.58. Fourteen Liberators attacked Orote, on Guam Island, and 18 othersattacked targets on &quot;Wake Island, dropping 37 tons.Caroline, Marshall and Mariana Islands.59. In the Carolines a total of about 200 Liberators and Mitchells attackedseveral of the principal islands.
