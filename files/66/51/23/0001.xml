Printed for the War C-cabinet.   June 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 323.14*A June, 1944.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-SOVIET   RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I wish to draw my colleagues&apos; attention to telegram No. 1431 of the 26th may from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow about Soviet press statements onthe anniversary of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, which I annex.2. The leaders in the Pravda, the organ of the Communist Party, and the .Izvestia, the Government organ, are certainly much more definite and. enthusiasticon the subject of co-operation both now and post-war than on earlier occasions.Since these leaders will be widely reproduced all over the Soviet Union, thismeans that the Soviet Government and the Communist Party wish Governmentand Party officials and the public to regard post-war collaboration as a definitepart of Soviet policy. Beside the phrase quoted in paragraph 4 of the telegram,the following significant phrases from the Pravda article are worth noting :- &quot; It did not enter the heads of the block-headed German-Fascistpoliticians that the Allied Powers are united by a community of basicinterests, taking precedence over one or another divergence of view which iseasily overcome with goodwill and, a striving for mutual understanding.&apos;&apos; The Soviet-British Treaty of Alliance has been concluded for 20 years.This fact in itself means that both parties to the Treaty regard it as a basis for prolonged post-war collaboration.&quot; . . . . the responsibility for the organisation and preservation of stablepeace after the winning of victory must be borne first and foremost by theGreat Allied Powers the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and the United Statesof America.&quot;. 3. The Izvestia article contains similar remarks. Both articles, incidentally,make suitable references to the Anglo-American contribution to Russian successesmade not only by the despatch of supplies to Russia, but also by our operations in Africa and in Italy, on the sea and in the air.4. I consider these articles an important indication of the soviet governments views on the subject of co-operation. . They both contain references to the Soviet view that consultation with their British and American allies hasalready shown that divergences of view can be easily overcome with mutual under-standing and goodwill. When we find the Soviet Governments ways and actionsirritating and they cause us natural suspicions, we should give these articles,authoritatively promulgated by the Soviet Government to their own people, someweight in the balance on the other side.,A. E.Foreign Of/ice, l&amp;th June, 1944.12393   [27652]
