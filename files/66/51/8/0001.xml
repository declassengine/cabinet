THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 308.9th June, 1944.Copy. No war CABINET.OFFER BY THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON TO THE GOVERNMENTOF PART OF APSLEY HOUSE AND THE WELLINGTON HEIRLOOMS.THE Chancellor of the Exchequer, in W.P. (44) 302, puts forward forapproval the Duke of Wellington^ offer to the Government of a part of the accommodation in Apsley House, together with a selection of the pictures, plate,and relics originally owned by his ancestor, the First Duke. If this offer beaccepted, the Government must spend  25,000 in repairing and redecoratingApsley House. They must also spend  6,000 a year on the maintenance of thebuilding and on the custody of the exhibits.2. The Duke&apos;s proposal is that by giving up the greater part of his house for the purpose, of a &quot;Wellington Museum&quot; he should still enjoy the bestapartment in London without paying any rates or taxes -the fabric of his housemeanwhile being maintained at no cost to himself.3. I fully agree with the Chancellor that we need a better setting forGovernment receptions than that provided by the gloom of Lancaster House.But I suggest that instead of spending  25,000 on providing amenities for the duke of Wellington the Government should restore to its old glories theBanqueting Hall in Whitehall. This building is Inigo Jones&apos; masterpiece. Itis all that is left of the great Palace of Whitehall, and if it is restored to its proper purpose it will be the finest centre of Government hospitality in the world.The National Gallery can provide better pictures than any possessed by the duke of Wellington with which to decorate the Banqueting Hall, and theGovernment already have a certain amount of fine furniture which could betransferred to it.4. Furthermore, every country in Europe has a fine official residence forits Foreign Secretary, but we have never provided our Secretary of State witha house. I would suggest that when the war is over Gwydyr House should become the Foreign Secretary&apos;s official residence. Gwydyr House is so placedthat it can very conveniently be connected with the Banqueting Hall.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.B. B.9th&apos;June, 1944.[27622]
