SECRET. - Copy No.   1W.P. (44) 347.26th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.Dr. SALAZAR.Memorandum by the Secretary op State eor Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a copy of a recent letter from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Lisbon, which gives a picture of Dr. Salazar5spersonality as it has. been further revealed in the recent wolfram negotiations.A. E.Foreign Office, 26th June, 1944.ANNEX.-   Sir R. H. Campbell to Mr. Eden.(Personal and Secret.)My dear Secretary of State, Lisbon, 16th June, 1944.MY Brazilian colleague, who, of course, has a number of very intimatecontacts here, tells me that he knows for a fact that Salazar considered resigningrather than give way over wolfram, and that he actually got as far as consulting the President of the Republic (who no doubt begged him to put any such thoughtout of his mind).I mention this because I sometimes fear you may think in London thatI am overstating the case when I say that in certain circumstances Salazar wouldbe capable either of defying us or of throwing in his hand. It is only natural that this should seem rather fantastic to anyone not directly acquainted withthe mind of this most extraordinary man, who thinks that he is always right and who believes that to go back on a decision once taken, or even to allowhimself to be deflected from a course that he has mapped out, is to belittle himself in his own and everyone else&apos;s eyes.&apos;His. attempt to throw on to us the responsibility for making him &apos;&apos; break hisword &apos;&apos; by withholding the 100 tons which he conceived to be due to the Germans,under their expired agreement, as their share of the wolfram that we had deliberately held back from the pool, was a bid to reinstate himself in some measure in his owii esteem by having the last word, if only on a subsidiary point. Had he, asI expected, remained adamant on this (I think he only gave in because on making enquiries he found that we were right in our claim that, since the expiry of theagreement, the Germans had been getting more v/olfram that he had&apos; intendedthem to do), he would have left us with a bone of contention which I think wecould, have exploited. As it is, I am afraid his 100 per cent, surrender will make him somewhat more difficult over other matters until he has got over hisresentment. It was obviously better, however, from the point of view of the controversy at issue, to have got him to make a clean job of the thing.12410   [27709]Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.
As to the future : we may get him into war with Japan at the appropriate time, but I am convinced that we shall never get him voluntarily into war with&apos;Germany. His whole mentality revolts against the idea of joining in the kill.Nor does he want to be No. 33 (or whatever it is) on the list of the united nations. He is persuaded that he will qualify for a higher place in the esteemof the post-war world by showing that he succeeded (except when he had to bowto appeals to the Alliance) in maintaining an independent line of his own andin following his Peninsular bloc policy.Yours ever,RONNIE CAMPBELL.
