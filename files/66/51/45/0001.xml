 &quot;jit, I ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTREATMENT OE MAJOR ENEMY WAR CRIMINALS.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of theCouncil.1. While I recognise the need for keeping the list of war criminals short and also the difficulty of deciding where tcdraw the line, I consider tha.t the listprepared by the Foreign. Secretary should be extended. It is, in my view, a mistake to confine the category almost exclusively to the Nazi party members.2. Field-Marshal Keitel is the only member of the German armed forcesincluded. I consider that those responsible for planning and ordering majorcriminal acts, such as the&apos; unprovoked murder of the peaceful inhabitants ofRotterdam, should be placed on the list. It is undesirable that those who have broken all the rules of conducting warfare previously accepted by members of anhonourable profession should escape punishment on the plea that they were onlyacting under orders of the German Government. Officers who behave likegangsters should be treated as such.3. I think it is wrong that the big business men of Germany who financedHitler should escape. The group of men in the heavy industries sought to use the Nazis for their own nefarious ends. Some should be executed as an example to the others. All should be deprived of their property.4. I miss from the list von Papen and Seyss Inquart. I should have thought they were well qualified for inclusion.5. It is also a matter for.consideration whether the Junker class should beleft in possession of their estates. It may be considered that they should bedealt with by a German Government, but it is arguable that the Allies shoulddeprive of their economic power the landowners who form the hard core ofGerman militarism, before the restoration of a democratic Government inGermany.Printed for the War Cabinet.
