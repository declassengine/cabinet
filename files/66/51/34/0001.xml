THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 334.Ibth June, 1944.WAR CABINET.BRITISH INTERESTS IN ETHIOPIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN paper W.P. (44) 333 I dealt with the question of the general policy to.befollowed by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Ethiopia, and stated thatHis Majesty&apos;s Governments requirements in that country were, briefly, a concession to construct, in the interest of the Sudan and Egypt, irrigation workson Lake Tsana at the outlet of the Blue Nile; and certain frontier adjustments- designed to include within British territory certain areas which are of little or no value apart from the fact that they contain grazing and water facilities on whichtribes now &quot;in British territory are dependent for their existence. The seriousethnographic and economic errors made when the earlier treaties with Ethiopiawere drawn have imposed very great hardships on tribes owing British allegiance,and have been the cause of the incessant trans-frontier raiding and friction withthe Ethiopian authorities.2. It is unnecessary in this paper to enlarge on the question of Lake Tsana,which is covered in W.P. (44) 333. The frontier adjustments sought byHis Majesty&apos;s Government are, in detail, as follows : (i) the transfer to the Sudan of the so-called Baro salient, where the- existing frontier cuts across a tribal area;(ii) the cession to Kenya of a small strip of territory to provide access to theessential water supplies of tribes in British territory, and to enablethe frontier to be effectively policed;(iii) the adjustment of the border between British Somaliland and ethiopia to include. within the former territory the essentialgrazing grounds of British Somali tribes, as agreed by an Anglo-Ethiopian Boundary Commission between 1931 and 1935.3. Even were it practicable to secure these cessions of territory withoutterritorial or other compensation, it would be undesirable politically to seek todo so. While the exact mature of the quid fro quo cannot be determined inadvance of the peace negotiations, it is suggested that the southern portion ofEritrea, whose inhabitants are predominantly of Amharic stock, includingAsmara, Massawa and the Danafcil coast of the Red Sea including Assab, might(subject always to United Nations strategic requirements) be ceded to Ethiopia(the northern portion, whose inhabitants are racially akin to Sudanese tribes,falling to the Sudan). It should be added that plans are under discussion forthe amalgamation of all the lands occupied by Somali tribes into a single Somaliterritory as part of the war settlement. Under these proposals the Ogadenterritory, which the Italians transferred from Ethiopia to Italian Somaliland,would not revert to its former status as a province of Ethiopia (as the Ethiopiansclaim) but, subject to the adjustment mentioned in (iii) above, would be includedin the Greater Somalia. It might be desirable in that case to suggest that the boundary between Ethiopia and the-Greater Somalia should be drawn along anethnographical line established by investigation on the spot.. a. e.foreign Office, lQth June, 1944. .Copy No. 3612401   [27667]
