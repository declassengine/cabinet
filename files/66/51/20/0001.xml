According to reports, the first wave of pilotlessaircraft appeared off Folkestone &quot;between 0U07 and OhJ+Q hours and penetrated Kent,  Surrey and   Sussex, four penetratingas far as Greater London.      The second wave, reported to consist of thirteen aircraft, appeared over the    Channel&quot;between Dungeness and South Foreland &quot;between OU58 and 0520hours.      Nine of these operated over Kent,  Surrey andSussex.      The third wave, about which there is stillconsiderable uncertainty, is reported to consist of two to four aircraft, which made landfall between Lyme Regisand Bridport from 0501 to 0535&apos; hours.     There.was somemovement of our own aircraft in this area at the time, and since no incidents have been reported, it may turn outthat the aircraft reported were not all pilotless aircraft,3. The aircraft were first reported to be coming in ata height of about 1,000 feet and rising gradually to aheight of k,000 feet.      Their speed was estimated at between 230 and 250 m,p,h, and the path of flight of someof them was reported as being erratic.k* Reports from the Royal Observer Corps describe theaircraft as having a long nose, small wings and showing abrilliant white light behind.      This corresponds generally with the description of the pilotless aircraft based on areport on wreckage of a German pilotless aircraft recentlyexamined in Sweden.5- Incidents reported by the Ministry of Home Securityas being due to pilotless aircraft occurred at;-&apos; (i) BETHNAL GREEN where the L.N.E.RV Railway bridgeover Grove Road was demolished and 200 personsrendered homeless..     Casualties were 2 killed and 28 injured.,

(ii) STONE (Near DARTFORD)  )) v/here slight -damage, but(iii) PLATT (near SEVENOAKS)) no casualties, was) caused,(iv) CUCKFIELD (Sussex)        )6. It is not possible to state whether these pilotlessaircraft attacks were delivered from the few &quot;ski&quot; siteswhich remain not completely damaged, or from the newlydiscovered modified sites which recent photographic reconnaissance has shown in some cases to be approachinga state of completion, permitting discharge of pilotlessaircraft.      Radar plots indicate, however,  that most ofthe pilotless aircraft operating over the South East area were probably launched from sites in the Pas de Calaisimmediately north of the Somme.    It is in this area thatactivity at the modified sites was recently reported and where some sites appear to be reaching an advanced stage of completion.7. In view of the difficulties attending the attack of the small and well camouflaged sites, the   Chiefs ofStaff recently considered the desirability of attacking the supply sites which are suspected of constituting theservicing depots and rail heads for the modified launchingsites.8, I   now feel that it would advisable to recommend to the Supreme Allied Commander that these supply sitesshould be heavily attacked immediately, and that alllaunching sites capable of operation&apos; should also be attacked whenever effort can be spared.    I am of theopinion that, in view of the present inaccuracy and light scale of attack of these pilotless aircraft, theair effort diverted should, at present, be limited towhat can be spared without prejudicing in any way the urgent needs of the Battle of France,(Intldc) CoPoAir Ministry, S.W. 1.,13th June, -\9hk* .
