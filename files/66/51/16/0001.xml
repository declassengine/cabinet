Printed, for the War Cabinet, June, 1944TOP secret.P. (44) 316izth June, 1944The circulation of this  paper has been strictly   limited.    It   is  issued  for   the personal use ofCdPY No^t?WAR CABINETMANPOWER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ARMY, 1944/45MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI circulate a paper on Army Manpower which has been prepared by the GeneralStaff.The broad points which emerge from this paper are as follows:  1. On the assumptions which are made in the paper,, there is a possibility thatthe fighting elements of a.s many as five divisions and four armouredbrigades may have been lost by the end of this year.2. There are no means by which we can save all of these divisions unless casulties are very much less than we expect. It looks as if two out of the five mustdisappear in any case.3. It might be possible to retain three of the divisions and two of the brigades atcadre strength, with a view to subsequent rebuilding, if:  [a) A considerable number of basically-trained men are provided from sources outside Army control in the next three months.(&amp;) At least 60,000 new intakes are allotted during July and August, whichwould be.becoming effective in December or early in 1945.4. If the Army is to be maintained in the first half of 1945 at the reduced levelreached at the end of 1944, a total of 190,000 men will be needed, and toproduce these in time, intakes of 30,000 or more a month must continueafter August.5. A loss of five divisions and four armoured brigades would reduce the British&apos;Field Army to sixteen divisions and fifteen armoured brigades. Failingintakes of the order indicated in paragraphs 3 and 4 the British Field army will fall to a level which is not only insufficient to carry out its inescapabletasks, viz., the occupation of Europe and the war against Japan but whichwill also be below what our Allies would regard as our proper military contribution to the joint effort both now and hereafter.I therefore ask the War Cabinet for the greatest possible dividend on a total of190,000 in the last half of 1944, at least 60,000 of these to be available in the first twomonths.   A very high proportion of the intake must be men fit for the fighting arms.P. J- G.The War Office,12th June, 1944.
MANPOWER  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  THE  ARMY,   1944/45-   WITHPARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE POSITION BY THE END OF JUNE, 19451. In submitting the Army demand for manpower for 1944 (W.P. (43) 464) it waspointed out that even if the full demand were met it would be necessary in order to meetwastage in the field by the dates expected to withdraw all the men fit for drafting fromthe six Field Army divisions in the United Kingdom. Even this step might fail, toprevent some measure of cannibalization of field formations. The actual allocation of150,000 men, representing a cut of more than half of the demand, made it clear at once that not only would the home divisions be reduced to a skeleton, but it would be quite impossible to rebuild them.2. This forecast is already being borne out, and a reorganization of the Home army is now taking place, involving the disappearance of six lower establishment divisions and their replacement by two field divisions at cadre strength.3. A new review of the manpower position of the Army has now been carried out,on the basic assumption that the war with Germany will continue at least until June,1945.   The position is set out below in two stages:  A. The position by the end of 1944.B. The position by the end of June, 1945.A. Position at the end of 1944.4. In assessing the situation that will develop during 1944, due regard has had tobe paid to the latest estimate of battle casualties from April to December, 1944, whichwill require replacement during this period. This estimate amounts to a net figure, after allowing for wounded returning to duty, of some 200,000 men, representing an increaseof rather more than 100,000 over the estimate for the corresponding period in W.P. (43)464.   This increase is accounted for by three main factors:  (a) A revision of previous estimates based on experience in Italy.(0) The plans for operations have been framed to produce the maximum impact on the enemy.(c) In the case of North-West Europe the scale of the initial assault, in which the heaviest casualties are to be expected, has been increased.5. Since the review carried out in September last, a number of reductions in capitalcommitments within the Army have been achieved or planned, amounting to a net figureof some 94,400 men. Despite these reductions, which have already liberated, and willcontinue to liberate men for drafting as reinforcements, it is estimated that by the end of1944 the army will be short in trained effectives by some 91,000 men. The most seriousaspect of this run-down is that it is reflected necessarily in fighting units, and particularlyin the infantry.  Here the shortage by the end of the year is expected to be some 30,000.6. The general effect of a run-down of 91,000 men will be a loss of the equivalent of five divisions&apos; worth of fighting men, together with a proportion of armour whichmay amount to four brigades&apos; worth.Theoretically this should throw up about 100,000 from the rear services of theseformations, who would be available for retraining as fighting men.7. The actual numbers which we may expect to obtain from cannibalization of rearservices are limited by three factors all difficult to assess:  (a) A high proportion of men in administrative units will be skilled or semi-skilledtradesmen, and a great many more are medically below the standard requiredfor the fighting arms.  The numbers suitable for transfer are relatively small.(b) The time lag in obtaining men from rear services which can only be broken up after it has become necessary to break up fighting units. The men have tobe re-sorted and then re-trained and this double process cannot be completeduntil a considerable time later; and in the case of units broken up late in1944- not until well into 1945.(c) The more successful our operations, the greater will be our administrativecommitments, both on lengthening lines of communication and in servicingthe air forces which may be transferred to the Continent in increasing numbers.In our subsequent calculations, therefore, we have taken credit in 1945 for a proportion, but not the whole of the rear services becoming available from cannibalizedformations.
8. It is quite clear that during 1944 the Army must run down, and nothing canstop this, though the following may reduce its extent:  (a) Casualties falling below the estimate.(6) An intake of basically-trained men from Anti-Aircraft Command as soon aspossible. The Chiefs of Staff have felt unable to accept any further reductionuntil OVERLORD is launched and the DIVER threat diminished; they are about to review the position again,(c) An intake of basically-trained men from the other Services.   In this connection the anti-aircraft portion of the Royal Air Force Regiment will be reviewed by the Chiefs of Staff as in (&amp;).(d) Further combing by the Army of its Imperial base and other sources of man-power overseas.   The gleanings from this will be small.&quot;(e) A large intake in July and August which will produce trained men at the endof 1944 and in early 1945.Summary.9. We are faced with a possible run-down during 1944 of 91,000, representingthe fighting element of five divisions and four armoured brigades.This can be checked by the extent to which the measures set out in paragraph 8can produce fully-trained fighting men in time.It may well turn out that some of the formations can be kept in cadre form,pending their re-creation as a result of these measures.B. Position by the end of June, 1945.10. We may start 1945 with a reduction of five divisions and four armouredbrigades at the worst, or with a reduction of say two divisions and two armouredbrigades at the best, or something in between.On the assumption that the British formations have run down in 1944 by thefull amount, we shall need an extra intake of 60,000 in 1944 to stop us running downstill further. This is additional to the 30,000 balance of present approved intakes and what we should expect to get from the rear services of cannibalized formations.But we hope that the reduction may in fact be less than the full amount. Inthis event, to keep the Army at the level reached at the end of 1944 we should need more than 60,000 because :  (a) There will be more formations fighting and wastage will be greater.(&amp;) Contraction of rear services will be correspondingly less.(c) Part at least of the intakes will have been used in checking the 1944 run-down.On the assumption that the reduction in 1944 is held to two divisions and two brigades of armour, the extra intake needed is estimated at 120,000. Moreover, if the run-down in 1944 is to be checked, intakes should start at not less than 30,000 a month from July, irrespective of what we may get from the other measures in paragraph 8.In our calculations we have assumed that we shall get 25,000 from these.A healthy position, which would both minimize the run-down to the end of 1944and hold the Army at the level reached by then, can only be achieved if the Armyreceives an additional 120,000 men to be put under training in the second half ofthis year.11. There is also the problem of the relief of men who have served for a longcontinuous period overseas. The Army is at present bringing back men who have beenabroad five years or more, and this process locks up at any one time some 14,000 menwho are off the strength of their units. Apart from the effect of long overseas service onmorale, statistics show that after long continuous service abroad the moral and physicalhealth of&quot; the soldier begins to show a marked decline which is reflected particularlyin the figures for incidence of malaria and venereal disease. The fighting efficiency.7of the individual soldier and of the Army as a whole is thus seriously impaired.12. It is, therefore, an urgent matter to reduce the overseas period to 4-J years,which would bring it nearer into line with the normal 4 year period for single* menof the Royal Air Force, and also to introduce a quota of leave to the United Kingdomafter some 2^ to 3 years abroad. A 4% 3&apos;ear period for service abroad and a quota of5,000 per month for leave would put up the resulting number of non-effectives at anyone time to 18,000 and 22,000 respectively, a total of 40,000. The Army is not in aposition to carry such a large shortage in units within its existing size. To operate theproposal satisfactorily it would be necessary to build up a pool, which could only bedone if an additional intake of 40,000 men to be put into training during 1944 were obtained.* For married men the period is 3 years.
Summary of the position.13. The total extra intake required in the last half of 1944 to hold the run-down in 1944 at two divisions and two armoured brigades, to prevent a furtherrun-down in 1945 and to build up a proper system for leave and for the relief ofmen with long service overseas is, therefore, 160,000 men. This intake is needed to ensure that we continue to carry an adequate share in the land battles throughout1944 and 1945.Other categories of personnel.14. To obtain the full picture it is necessary to consider other categories of personnel including the women&apos;s services.   The position broadly is:  (a) Intakes to the A.T.S. will, by the end of June, be some 3,000 short of theallocation for the first half of 1944, whereas actual wastage is proving higherthan was anticipated. A run down in A.T.S. by the end of the year, whichwill be reflected automatically as a corresponding increase in requirements ofmen, can, therefore, only be prevented by an intake during the second halfof 1944 of 7,800 additional to the previously stated demand of 12,000.(6) The position in regard to civilians is far from satisfactory. The allocation fellfar short of stated requirements, and in any event has not readily beenforthcoming. Special measures are now being taken to provide the numbersallocated, but it must be emphasized that the short-fall against requirements,which are mainly for installations which will service the armies in western europe, can only be made good by posting soldiers and so increasing the deficiencies in units.(c) It- appears probable that previously stated requirements for Nursing Officersand V.A.Ds. will be met. There is, however, a new requirement for NursingOfficers, additional to the numbers previously stated, amounting to 825, andthe position will only be satisfactory if this extra number can be found.Summary of requirements for the balance of 1944.15. The Army requires during the six months July to December, 1944:  (a) To minimize the run-down by the end of 1944 to a figure of the order oftwo divisions and two armoured brigades&apos; worth of fighting men, andto hold the Army at this level in the first half of 1945, an additional^ 160,000 men over and above the present approved allocation.(&amp;) This, with the balance of some 30,000 outstanding from the present approved allocation, amounts to a total of 190,000, requiring intakes atthe rate of somewhat more than 30,000 a month from July.(c) An intake of 16,800 for the A.T.S. to which must be added any shortageof intakes against allocations for the period January-June, 1944(estimated at 3,000).(d) An allocation of 825 Nursing Officers, additional to the previous demandfor the whole of 1944.(e) The fulfilment of the previous demand for 600 V.A.Ds. for the second half year, additional to any short-fall of the first half year intakesagainst requirements.(/) The fulfilment of the 1944 allocation of civilians.(b44/188)   80   6/44   W.O.P.   18042
