Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.SECRET.        , x f Copy No.-W.P. (44) 336.20th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AVIATION.memorandum by the secretary of state for AlR.IN W.P. (44) 303 the Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and for theColonies advocate the immediate transfer of responsibility for civil aviation fromthe Air Ministry to the Ministry of War Transport. In W.P. (44) 322 the lord privy Seal supports this recommendation.2. It is not necessary for me to develop the practical arguments againstthe immediate transfer of responsibility from the Air Ministry since the Ministerof War Transport has made it clear in W.P. (44) 331 that he could not accept this responsibility until six months after the end of the war with Germany. Buta decision to transfer responsibility for civil aviation from the Air Ministryat that stage would still have serious consequences.3. I attach as Appendix &quot; A &quot; a note by the Air Staff in which theysummarise the military arguments for leaving responsibility for civil aviationwith the Air Ministry at any rate for the duration of the war with Japan, whichwill, to a far greater extent than the German war, be a war of air transport.These arguments are, in mv view, conclusive. I have given others in my paper.P. (44) 276. &quot; &quot;4. I attach as Appendix &quot; B &quot; my comments on the salient points raised in w.P. (44) 303 and W.P. (44) 322.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 20iA June, 1944.APPENDIX &quot;A.&quot;FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AVIATION,Note by the Air Staff.It is understood that proposals have been put forward for the transfer ofresponsibility for civil aviation from the Air Ministry to the Ministry of war transport, either immediately or six months after the conclusion of the german war and therefore during the Japanese war.2. The Air Staff are, of course, only concerned with this question in so faras it affects the prosecution of the war in the air or the ability of the Royal AirForce to carry out, with the maximum of efficiency and economy, the tasks thatmay be allotted to it when the war is over.3. It is our considered opinion, viewing the problem from the above stand-,point, that it would be harmful to the war effort if the responsibility for civilaviation were removed from the Air Ministry at any rate before the end ofhostilities with Japan, and that there are good military reasons fore delayinga decision as to what should be done thereafter until more is known about thearrangements for world security.[27675] . .
4. While the war with Germany and Japan continues, the RAP. transport command and B.O.A.C. share, and will have to share, the available resourcesof men and material, to say nothing of airfields, meteorological and signalsfacilities, and so on. The balancing of requirements between these two agenciesis only possible if the work of both is controlled and co-ordinated, as at present,in one Ministry.5. The Air Staff and the Department of Civil Aviation are jointlyinvestigating the ways and means whereby civil air transport, in preparation for its post-war responsibilities, can expand into military areas and liberatedterritories as soon as the military situation allows. Such expansion is only possible under a carefully-planned integration of military and &apos;civil services,the latter being operated initially in military form. If responsibility for civilaviation were transferred to another Department, the effect on this planned expansion would inevitably be serious and the opportunities open to the civiloperators adversely affected. -  -6. A proportion of the equipment and personnel at present employed mmilitary air transport will be earmarked for transfer, as circumstances allow, to civil aviation. The release of these resources will have to be made step by stepduring the closing phases of the war and in the ensuing armistice period. It isessential for this purpose that the military and civil authorities should belong tothe same Department,7. For some time to come, the R.A.F. will continue to depend largely for transport types, and to some extent for combat types, on American production.The best available type of transport aircraft, suitable both for transport command arid for B.O.A.C.. is the American C. 47 (Dakota). It is improbable that the Americans wrould agree to supply lease-lend aircraft to the R.A.F. foruse by B.O.A.C. if the civil character of the latter had been emphasised by itstransfer to the control of a civil Ministry. This would leave for B.O.A.C. only alimited ,supply of British types, many of them improvised and not really suitablefor civil work, whereas, under the umbrella of the R.A.F., they can now get themore efficient American types.APPENDIX &quot;B.&quot;Comments on W.P. (44) 303 and W.P. (44) 322.1.   In W.P. (44) 303, it is argued-(a) that, if a coherent policy is to be evolved for post-war civil aviation, asingle Minister must have ultimate responsibility to the Cabinet andto Parliament, and that this is not the case at present since &apos;&apos; respon-sibility for policy, in reality if not in name, rests with the Lord privy seal, as Chairman of C.A.T. Committee &quot; ;(b) that we are falling behind in the race with other nations and,  inparticular, with the United States; and that this is especially true of the provision of aircraft;(c) that, while restoration of the entire control of civil aviation to the AirMinistry would no doubt in many ways be better than the existing position, a Service Department is, by its nature, not fitted to dischargethis responsibility; and(d) that the struggle for the control of the post-war air has begun and theDominions are looking anxiously to us for a lead.2.   As for (a), there is at present a single Minister responsible, by statute,for civil aviation.   That Minister is the Secretary of State for Air and any departure from this position would require fresh legislation.   The duties of theLord Privy Seal were defined by the War Cabinet at their meeting on the26th June, 1943, i.e., that he should assume responsibility for the international air Transport Conference and for the inter-Dominion discussions so far as theUnited Kingdom Government was concerned, as well as for the corprdination ofGovernment policy.  I do not agree that the present arrangements are as iinsatis-f/factory as W.P. (44) 303 and W.P. (44) 322 suggest.   If, however, the Cabineti-feel that they are, the right solution is for the Secretary of State for Air to takef over the Chairmanship of the C.A.T. Committee.
3. As for (b) above, the Americans are certainly showing- keen interest inthe future of their civil air transport. I am not clear, -however, on what thestatement is based that we are falling behind them in the race, and moresurprising behind other nations. (It is not specified who these other nations are.) Since the war began the Air Ministry has consistently, and often in the face of great difficulties, pressed that no facilities should, be granted in or acrossBritish territory to American airlines except in so far as they are engaged in the prosecution of the war. The Americans have long been restive under this restraint and their recent reaction to our proposal to operate- a service to South Americashows how ready they are to leap at any chance we give them. So far, however,from falling behind in the race, we have been remarkably successful in main-taining what Mr. Berle has recently described as the &quot; log-jam.&quot;4. There is a reference in W.P. (44) 303 to our inferiority vis-a-vis the americans in the matter of transport aircraft. This is admittedly the mainweakness of our present position and. I regret it as much as anyone. But no blameattaches to the Air Ministry for a state of affairs which derives from the factthat, for so long, we in this country bore the brunt of the war alone. We havenot yet reached such a stage in the war that there can be any large-scale turnoverof industry from the production of military to the production of civil types.Moreover, we are still vitally dependent on allocations of transport aircraft from america to meet our military requirements. Any policy which affected theseallocations adversely would impair our war effort and be quite unacceptable forthat reason.5. In these circumstances, I am convinced that our right course is not to embark on a commercial race with the Americans at a time when their stable holdsthe best horses, but to maintain, as long as possible, the status quo under whichAmerican commercial ambitions are being largely held in check.6. As for (c) of paragraph 4, the Air Ministry is much more than just a service Department. The Secretary of State for Air has two distinct and separateconstitutional responsibilities, one for the R.A.F. and the other for civil aviation.On the military side, he is assisted by the Air Council. On the civil side, he isassisted by a wholly civil department in charge of a senior Civil Servant, with oneof the Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State exercising a special oversight.I do-not see what would be gained much would certainly be lost by removing the Civil Aviation Department from the Secretary of State for Air and attachingit to some other Minister.7. In any case, the &quot;commercial outlook &quot; as defined in W.P. (44) 303,i.e., &quot; the attitude of the shopman to his customer,&quot; is, in the main, the respon-sibility of the operator and not of a Government Department unless, indeed, theState is itself to assume responsibility for operations. It is one of the functionsof the Department of Civil Aviation and a very important function -to see thatthe operator is given every assistance in his task, but the creation of &quot;a market for civil aviation not only by safety and punctuality but by taking every possible step to sell itself to the public &apos;&apos; is, and must be, the responsibility of thepractitioner, and the practitioner is not the Civil Aviation Department.8. There remains (d) of paragraph 4. The suggestion here is that we have so far failed to give the Dominions a clear lead on post-war policy. This is farfrom being the case. The Dominions would be the first to acknowledge the valueof the lead we have given them and of the papers they have had from us overthe past three years. , At the conference last autumn we explained to them our plans for the post-war ordering of international air transport plans which hadbeen worked out by us in considerable detail and we reached agreement.Discussions on matters affecting particular Dominions have taken place since then with representatives of the Dominions concerned. Talks with the americans have been held and we are waiting to go forward to a full international conference.9. In W.P. (44) 322, the Lord Privy Seal, in supporting the recomuienda-tion for the immediate transfer of civil aviation from the Air Ministry putforward in W.P. (44) 303, states that at present &quot; delays arise and difficultiesoccur which would be avoided if the Civil Aviation Department were relieved ofmilitary supervision and restraint&quot; and quotes, as an example the supply of aircraft for British West Indian Airways. The Civil Aviation Department ism no sense under military supervision at the present time nor does it suffer fromany restraint other than what is inevitable and proper in a major war.  As the
note at Appendix &quot; A &quot; shows, British civil aviation would be in a much less satisfactory state to-day and its prospects much less bright if responsibility for ithad been vested, or were now vested, in some other Department.10. On the question of aircraft for British West Indian Airways, it will suffice to say that none of the 400 Ansons to which the Lord Privy Seal referswould be suitable for British West Indian Airways&apos; services, which involvesubstantial cross-water flights. Ansons with Cheetah engines and Rotol feather-ing propellers will not be available until September, and experience shows thatuntried types should not be operated in tropical climates until teething troubleshave been surmounted. The D.H. 89&apos;s to- which the Lord Privy Seal also refersdo not, with an economic payload, have- the single-engine performance on which british West Indian Airways have rightly insisted.11. Finally, on paragraph 8 of W.P. (44) 322, I would remark, first, thatBritish civil aviation is already represented in Washington by a senior civil servant who is also Director of Administration and Finance at the Royal AirForce Delegation and, secondly, tha.t assignments of aircraft can only be obtained through the machinery of the Combined Munitions Assignments Board in washington, which is a body composed entirely of British and American Servicerepresentatives. The record of the British Service representatives on this Board,acting on instructions from the Air Ministry, shows that there has been noneglect of civil requirements.
