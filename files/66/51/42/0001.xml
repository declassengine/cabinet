this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.SECRET.Copy No. iW.P. (44) 342.22nd June, 1944.WAR CABINET.WOMAN ALLEGED TO BE A SNIPER.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.THE facts of this case, to which reference was made at the meeting of theWar Cabinet held on the 16th June, are, so far as ascertained at present, thata tank-landing ship brought to Southampton on the 12th June a number ofGerman prisoners of war, some British casualties a,nd 15 civilians 13 Frenchmenof the peasant type, a Turkish woman who had been living with a Frenchman,and a German woman. Two United States soldiers were in charge of the civilians and handed them over to the civil authorities at the port, the SecurityControl Officer and the Immigration Officer, as civilians evacuated from thefighting zone. No documents were handed over and no explanation was given why they had been sent, and no report was made either by the master of the vessel orby the escort that the German woman was in any way suspect, though one of theship&apos;s officers mentioned casually that he had overheard a suggestion that she might be the sniper.Examination of the other 14 civilians has disclosed no security interest, andit is clear that they were sent by the United States troops under a mjsunder-standing of the arrangements as to who should be evacuated.The German woman, whose name is Erna Heilmann (nee Munchen), has beeninterrogated several times by experienced officers. According to her story, she isGerman-born and is the widow of a German who died in 1942. She speaksfrankly and gives the impression that she is completely sincere. She deniedwithout hesitation ever having had a weapon in her possession, and the inter-rogating officers were convinced that she spoke the truth when she denied evershooting at any Allied soldiers. She is described as anxious to tell the truth, andthe story which she has told on several occasions varies only in immaterial details;for example, she claimed om arrival to have been Polish before marriage, but hasexplained frankly that she was advised by her French friends to claim to be ofAllied origin, as the United States troops would treat her better.It appears that two United States journalists got aboard the tank-landingship on its arrival or talked from the quayside to those on board, including theGerman woman. According to Press reports, an unnamed United States corporalstated to a reporter that the guards who handed her over to him warned him tobe careful, as she had smiled at United States soldiers and fired on them whenthey approached her. This corporal, however, made no such report when handingher over to the civil authorities on landing, and the story bears signs of being-embroidered to account for a German woman among the evacuees. It is signifi-cant that some accounts say that she shot at Canadians, who are not known to bein the area of Sainte-Mere-Eglise, where she is reported to have been &quot; captured.&quot;Enquiries are proceeding (1) .in Normandy to ascertain why she was sent tothis country, and (2) to locate the tank-landing ship and ascertain whether any information about the woman was given to the Officer Commanding. It is improbable that the United States corporal who escorted.the civilians will be veryreadily traced.[27695]
To sum up. There is at present no evidence that the woman was a sniperbeyond loose talk, which may be pure imagination. If evidence to substantiatethe allegation should be received, the crime is not justiciable in this country andthe woman must be returned to France and tried by a military court. If such evidence becomes available, this course will be adopted. In the meantime, there appears to be no alternative to keeping her in prison under the Royal Prerogativeas a civilian of enemy nationality. It would hardly be right to send this Germanwoman back to France and to leave her at large there.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S. W. 1,22nd June, 1944.
