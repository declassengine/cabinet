Numbers of casualties,,looINTRODUCTIONThe note summarizes the information which has been collected duringthe first eight days of attack by 8flying bombs&apos;.It is understood that, as far as explosive effects are concerned&quot;1&quot;, theweapon consists of a very light case bomb, containing a charge of 1060 kg. ofRDX/DNB/AmN03 17/54/30 with a biscuit of BDS/Ca(N0g )2/AnNQs 2l/3l/38.     This isthe German filling 52A, which has been previously encountered in the so called -SoBolOOO mine, in which its performance was estimated, from observations of damage to be roughly equivalent to that of a similar weight of T.N.T.     It isunderstood that there is some indication that a larger weapon has also been used,but no confirmation of this has been received. * -The bomb is believed to contain several different fuzes^, all of whichare intended to be instantaneous in action.     Two of these fuzes are known, to beelectrical, and are likely^to produce detonation very rapidly, possibly even before, the light nose in front of the explosive has crumpled.     A third fuse ismechanical., and it is likely to be-slower in action than the two electrical fuzesIn what follows we shall refer to the flying bomh by the code-word FLYcIt should be stated from the outset that almost all the information in the paragraphs comes from advance &quot;reconnaissance&apos; reports, which are liableto modification as full reports become available.Information from Armament Research Department.Information from A.I.2(g) Air Ministry.   -
CRATERS FROM FLYData collected from Bomb Census returns are now available for 88 cratersformed in soft soil and 14 in hard soil.     The average sizes are 16 ft. x 3g ft.for the former and 13 fto x 5^ ft. for the latter;    the maximum diameters anddepths which have been reported to date are 35 and 12 fto respectively for softsoil and 20 and 8 ft. for hard soil.     In addition, in one special case a largetype B crater was formed in clay of size 52 ft. x 15 ft.     The circumstancesrelating to this incident, as obtained from the Bomb Census form, are as follows:-&quot;Time of fall; 01.30 hrs.     Time of explosion; 01.45.     This is verifiedby the police.     A witness states - he heard missile fall and engineappeared to be stopped.     Missile was buried and there appeared to be afire in the hole, diam. 6 - 8 ft., depth 4 - 5 ft.     He walked away and upon reaching a point 79 ft. away he fell down upon hearing the explosion.&quot;The incident is being investigated further.     At the moment, it would appear thatthe Fly fell, after attack by fighter aircraft, as an unexploded bomb.     The firemight have been due to ignition of the fuel and this may have initiated the .explosion of the charge.DAMAGE TO-HOUSESA number of house damage plots have now been examined. - Pending examin-ation of the relevant photographs, which are not yet to hand, the average radii of damage deduced from them must be regarded as provisional only, and it is premature to say &quot;if the house damage data will suggest the use of more than one size weapon.,The average radii deduced from eighteen incidents are as follows:-*&quot;?.:-:.&apos;! &apos;: ......... ........      ......... V. ......... .. . ..........       ......Average Cii (Houses with 9 in. A &apos;	*cle Radii of House Dan solid brick walls or &apos;. B	lage (ft75&quot; .1 in. cavity walls) C72	116	180The damage to the houses was caused by blast and exhibited no unusualfeature.     The extent of the damage&quot;is about that expected from a charge of1060 kg. of a.non-aluminized explosive filling, but the nearest analogy as regardsdamage is with the German 1200 kg. S.C. bomb which&apos;contains a charge of 700 kg. ofan aluminized filling. &apos;   For comparison, the average radii of damage for thisweapon are;-A. 70 ft.       B. 129, ft.       C. 320 ft. (Quoted from R.E.ETote No.214.The &apos;C radius may be somewhatover-estimated).Three other incidents involved explosions at about eaves level (one ona tree, the other two on railway bridges).     The -average radii, of damage fromthese incidents were;- .   -A. 90 ft.       B. 155 ft.       C. 230 ft.It will be observed that these values are larger than for the other incidents,but it is desired to withhold speculation into the cause of this until theappropriate photographs have been examined and the reality of the effect has beenestablished.The last house damage incident which has been recorded relates to a bomb which exploded on the edge of the rpof of an eight storeyed block of flats(steel framed).     In this case, there was no &apos;A&apos; damage to houses at about 20 ft.from the explosion and below it;    the &apos;B&apos; and &apos;C&apos; damage radii were 80 and 250 ft.respectively.DAMAGE TO SHELTERS    &quot; . -^^--^tt-tt,--, - m     i mm ,mm mm \An impression has been formed that shelters are withstanding the effects of Fly well.     A survey of reinforced brick shelters is in progress.     Until the&quot;reports relating to this are received the only cases upon which we have detailed information are as follows.     In -two of the three cases.at least the shelters
ICJH StCRfc T- o&quot;18practically received direct hits and the damage was no more than could have been expected under these circumstances.     In the third case, a&apos;domestic surfaceshelter was severely damaged at 25 ft. 8 in., but its construction may have beenbelow standard specifications.(a) A communal surface shelter at ,3 ft. from the point of explosion of aFly was demolished for half its length (i.e. up to about 15 ft.) and cracked badlyover the remaining half.     The shelter was 45 ft. x 9 ft. x 10 ft. high (externalmeasurements) and constructed in reinforced brickwork with a 12 in. r.c. roof.A similar shelter at 72 ft. was only slightly damaged.(b) An Anderson shelter was caved in at 6 ft. from an explosion.(c) A domestic surface shelter at 25 ft. 8 in. from the centre of a craterwas severely shattered and partly collapsed.     It was approx. 9 ft. square by ft. 6 in. high and built with reinforced brick walls (13-g- in.) and a 6 in. r.c.roof slab not tied to the walls. * -DAMAGE TO LARGE BUILDINGSSeveral incidents, have occurred where damage has been caused to large buildings.     Since such incidents require more detailed study in the fieldreconnaissance reports upon five only have as yet been received.(a) Load-bearing wall buildings1.     Modern working *c lass flats with 13-g- in. load-bearing brick wallssconcrete floors and flat roofs, received &apos;C type damage at 80 ft.     Olderproperty (3-4 storeys;  13s- in&quot; walls) were nearer to the explosion and theaverage distances of &apos;A&apos; and &apos;B&apos; type dama&apos;ge were 55 and 75 ft. respectively.The damage is about that expected from the type of property and the weight ofthe charge in the bomb.2.     Bankruptcy Buildings.     A three-storey and basement building withload-bearing brick walls (3 ft. 4^ in. at basement level lessening to 1 ft. lOg- in.at roof level in one portion and 1 ft. 10g in. walls in another portion) was about ft. from the point of explosion in the courtyard.     The near and thick wall wasdemolished over about 80 ft. frontage;    the average distance of &quot;&apos;Aj damage for thebuilding being 50 ft.      The walls of the neighbouring block were bulging (in placesup to 12 in.) and severely cracked and it was considered that this block would bedemolished.     The average distance for this degree of damage was 72 ft.Neighbouring buildings were evacuated up to average distances of 100 and 180 ft.corresponding to &apos;C&quot;b&apos; and &apos;Ca&apos; damage respectively.The extent of damage in this incident was rather greater than wouldhave been expected bearing in mind the thickness of the walls of the buildingsconcerned, but cases of exceptionally severe damage have occurred with allweapons in the past.3.     The Wellington Barracks Chapel was severely damaged by a Fly whichexploded about roof level, which collapsed completely.     Upper parts of the 3 ft.thick walls were demolished to about 20=25 ft. from ground level, and up to anaverage distance of about 30 ft. from the point of explosion.     The damage isabout that expected for a roof level explosion on a building of this type.(b) Framed buildings1.     A Fly exploded near the edge of the roof of an eight-storey steel-framedblock of flats.     Demolition was confined to, the top three storeys and coveredabout 1000 sq.ft. on each of them, i.e. up.to an average distance of about 20 ft.from.the point of explosion.     The block of flats was partially evacuated;details are awaited.     .2.     A direct hit was made on the corner of a four-storey block of r.c. framedflats.     The bomb exploded between the second and third floors on the face of thebuilding, demolished the columns at this point and this allowed the flat concreteroof to hinge down on to the second floor over an area of about 1200 sq.ft.The brickwork for all floors vertically below this was completely demolished.The whole blook was evacuated;    -the evacuation distance was thus at least. 200 ft.ildummal^building^ &apos;Three reconnaissance reports have been received, which indicate damageof the expected order0        &apos; &apos; 1
lo     An explosion, on the corner of the roof of a five-storey r.o, framed build-ing of a radio valve factory,,     The roof and top two floors were demolished over an approximate area of 550 sq.ft.     Little damage was caused to machinery but all flo*oraof the block had to be evacuated over an area qf about 6000 sq.ft.2o     A Ply exploded about 100 ft. from a factory, probably of the framed typewith corrugated asbestos sheeting.     No structural damage was sustained but thesheeting was demolishedo     No machinery suffered damage.3o     A direct hit on an engineering factory with 9 in. brick walls and timberroof trusses caused demolition over .about 15,000 sq.ft. with a further 5000 sq.ft.of collapsed roof due to blast and a small fire which developed.     About 8Cr% ofthe machines were damaged or destroyed.     Other factory buildings in the neighbour-hood also suffered some damage by blast and fire.     In general, the distance of severe damage was up to about 100 ft. from the point of explosion.RAILWAY BRIDGES . &apos;One full report and two reconnaissance reports have been received whichindicate damage of a somewhat lesser extent than might have been expected when corn-pared with previous incidents, eBg. one where a parachute mine exploded upon abridge carrying eight tracks and demolished practically the whole superstructure.L     The first flying bomb to land in London demolished by a direct hit halfa wrought iron girder bridge carrying four tracks.     Two of the five girders were removed from their bearings and fell into the roadway beneath.     The remainingthree girders vrere damaged but did not fall.     Railway traffic was restored quicklyby removing the debris of the fallen girders and the troughing between them anderecting a new temporary bridge carrying two tracks on the existing abutments whichwere undamaged. .- 20     Another direct hit on a railway bridge carrying four tracks damaged the cross girders on-ly and caused a hole in the decking about 15 fto x 10 ft.     Theabutment was cracked in this case$   fuller details&apos;will be obtained later, whichwill include information about the traffic delays.3o     A direct hit was.made on the railway bridge carrying the tracks fromCharing Cross Station across the river.     Little damage^ was suffered by the mainlattice girders, but twelve cross girders were blown away or fell into the river,,leaving a rectangular hole of about 180 ft. x 60 ft., involving three lines oftraffic.    -Traffic on the remaining lines was held up for a day or so, but the repair of the damage will take some weeks.DAMAGE TO TIMBER BUILDINGS.The reports which are to hand show that the expected extent of damage.byblast has been suffered by timber buildings.      In one incident, some smallbungalows were&apos; demolished to an average distance of 110 ft. and have been scheduledas SB&apos;: damage up to an average distance of 215 ft.     In other incidents, farm shedswere badly damaged and scheduled for demolition at 150 ft. and up to 280 ft.Photographs are awaited for these incidents.FIRE FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION OF FLYING BOMBSSince the explosive filling of the flying bomb is non-aluminized, it7fould not be expected that fire would frequently follow the explosion.     In theearly days, few fires were in fact reported, but it has been&quot;noticed from theHoSoWoRo reports that fires are reported in comparatively many cases of recentdates.   A detailed field investigation is now in progress to ascertain if therehas really been an increase in the fire-raising efficiency of the weapon and, ifsos to investigate its cause.     Pending.the results of the inquiry it is not,desired to comment further upon this aspect of the weapon.The distribution and density of Fly is of some interest in estiiT&amp;tingthe vulnerability of any key points in London, and particularly in our case ofohe Tube tunnels.     Really the distribution of Fly per kilometre square should b...,used, but the plots of the actual points of impact are not yet available.     Thenumber falling in the different London boroughs is the closest to this that may at present be obtained.     Table I shows the actual number of Fly reported asfailing during the hours of daylight (05.00 - 23.00) and darkness  (23.00 - 05.00)for the period over which &quot;intensive raiding has occurred.
I OP ^tLHt- 5190The maximum number falling on any one borough in one period is seven,this number being achieved in Croydon on the night of 16/7th June and in Wandsworthon the night of the 17/l8th June.     Croydon has received more missiles than anyother borough, a total of 29 Fly having arrived during the hours of daylight anddarkness combined for the period studied.     Two other boroughs, Wandsworth andLewisham, have each received 25 during the same time.A study of the actual number arriving will be misleading, however, unlessthe area of the borough is taken into account.     Table II shows the density of Flyper square mile for each of the London boroughs.     The highest density by day isthat of Holborn (1.58 per sq.mile) and by night Bermondsey (2.55 per sq.mile).An overall density achieved by combining day and night attacks gives Bermondsey thehighest total with 3.4 projectiles per sq.mile.     These are the densities obtained by the enemy in approximately 8f 24-hour periods of raiding.The densities as given are an asidered and of necessity therefore do notoccurs. Cases of clustering which mightTwickenhams where the density over one parough plot) would appear to be near 5 pergiven in Table II.- An accurate estimateout when the actual points of impact havesafety at this stage is that there is a done projectile a second will follow.verage for the whole of the borough con-reflect the clustering of bombs whichbe mentioned may be found in Lewisham andrticular sq. mile (as estimated from asq.mile as opposed to the average figuresof this clustering effect will be carriedbeen plotted.     All that can be said withistinct probability that having receivedTable III shows the times of arrival of Fly as estimated from the &quot;Greens&quot;All times are not available but there is no reason to. suppose that there has beenpurposive selection of some kind in the number of times omitted.     It will be notedfrom Table I that, the number of missiles fired during the 144 hours of daylight is216s or a flat rate of 3 every 2 daylight hours.     Assuming that the time of firingis without purpose (i.e. it is random) the number expected to arrive in any 5 hoursis 7 .From the &quot;Greens&quot; we see that 19 missiles fell during the rush hours07.00 - 10.00 and 17.00 - 19.00 out of the 74 daylight times listed.     This gives a figure of 7 per 5 rush hours, a figure comparable with the overall flat rate.On the average over the whole period, therefore, there has been notendency for the fire to be concentrated into the peak travel hours.     There is,however, a definite indication that this has been done in the last day or two ofthe period considered.TABLE TVDistribution of FLY in different regionsDate(15/16.6.44.16.6.44.16/17.6.44,17.6o44.17/18.6.44.18.6.44.18/19.6.44.19.6.44.19/20.6 Q44.20.6.44.20/21.6.44.21.6.44.21/22.6.44.22.6.44.22/23.6.44,23.6.44.23/24.6.44,TOTALSRegion 4205112214221&quot;4655Region 53937362062371723571720928274410438Region 611113131113Region 1220231892231192717131042713465309Total7969553186713754102637321556459616815Total number of FLY outside Region 5 ^ 377.
