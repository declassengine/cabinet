(44) 333.\Uh June, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY IN ETHIOPIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN January 1942 His Majesty&apos;s Government denned their fundamentalpolicy in Ethiopia as being its re-estabhshment as speedily as possible as anative State under its own ruler involving His Majesty&apos;s Government in aminimum of political responsibility and as light a burden as possible on theBritish exchequer. The satisfaction of British desiderata in Ethiopia, whichare -treated in detail in a separate paper, was left until a later date. For thepurpose of the present paper these may be defined as a concession for theconstruction of irrigation works on Lake Tsana at the outlet of the Blue Nileand frontier adjustments designed to include within British territory certain areas which are of little or no value apart from the fact that they containgrazing and water facilities on which tribes now in British territory depend fortheir existence; and to remove the causes of incessant trans-frontier raidingand friction with the Ethiopian authorities. It was recognised at the same time that a measure of financial and-administrative assistance would have to be&apos;given to the Emperor to enable him to set up his administration after five yearsof exile for himself and Italian occupation of his country. The Anglo-EthiopianAgreement of the 31st January, 1942, which recognised Ethiopia as a sovereignindependent State, accordingly provided inter alia for the payment, by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to Ethiopia of an annual subsidy tapering from H- million in 1942 to  250,000 in 1945, and the appointment of British advisers and judges and the despatch of a British Military Mission to train the &quot;regularEthiopian Army of ten battalions.2. At the end of 1943 the policy described above was reconsidered at the instance of, the Deputy Minister of State (now Minister Resident) in the middle east, on the basis of reports that the situation in Ethiopia was seriouslydeteriorating and called for measures to improve the administration of thecountry. After full discussion in a War Cabinet Committee, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decided to move the Emperor to invite a small mission of enquiry to visit Ethiopia with the object of reviewing the working of the Anglo-Ethiopianagreement of January 1942, of considering whether it should be amended,replaced or allowed to continue; and recommending what further assistanceHis Majesty&apos;s Government might afford in the immediate future.3. The Emperor however rejected His- Majesty&apos;s Governments proposalfor a mission of enquiry and himself put forward proposals, which had forsome time been under preparation, for a new temporary agreement to replace the agreement of the 31st January, 1942. The general sense of these proposals was the removal of all restrictions on full Ethiopian sovereignty. The Emperorwished to abolish the precedence of His Majesty&apos;s Minister, and the restriction of his own freedom of action in the&apos;matter of the appointment of advisers. he also asked for the return of the areas placed by the agreement under british military administration and of the Ogaden, and the appointment of an expertto recommend what further financial assistance should be afforded to Ethiopia.4.   Meanwhile, the Emperor had been seeking United States assistance inthe rehabilitation of his country.  He had secured the loan of five million ouncesof silver, supplies of transport and other material under Lend-Lease, and the12400   [27666]
despatch of a technical mission to investigate the position of the roads, agricultureand mineral resources. During the recent visit of United States representatives to London an understanding was reached that &quot; both Governments were interestedin aiding the re-establishment of a stable independent Government in Ethiopiaand that there should be close consultation and co-operation between them forthis purpose.&quot;5. The Emperor has now availed himself of Article 12 of the agreement to give three months&apos; notice of termination, and by so doing has secured, failing afresh agreement to the contrary, the removal of the limitations on his sovereigntyreferred to at the end of paragraph 3. It has accordingly become necessary to review the situation once more and I have done so in consultation with HisMajesty&apos;s Minister at Addis Ababa, whom I invited to visit London with that end in view.6. There are three policies open to His Majesty&apos;s Government in ethiopia : (1) Allow the agreement to terminate and thus divest ourselves of any furtherresponsibility for the administration. This would involve treatingEthiopia like any other fully independent country and leaving theEmperor to his own resources plus such assistance as he might beable to obtain from ourselves, the United States of America or- elsewhere. It would involve our seeking to obtain the Tsana concessionby direct bidding and frontier rectifications by negotiation at thepeace conference.(2) The assumption by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a measure of responsi-bility for the good government of Ethiopia. This would certainlyentail the payment of a subsidy on an increased scale over an indefinite period and the supply of material and personnel and direct inter-vention with the Emperor&apos;s Government to ensure that our advice wascarried out. In view of the extreme independence and xenophobia ofthe Ethiopian character it might involve an intervention in thecountry to an unforeseeable extent.(3) A policy of collaboration with the United States of America to provideEthiopia, on a joint basis, with financial, technical and material assistance. Any measure of responsibility which might be entailedwould at least be shared between ourselves and the Americans. Underthis policy we should avoid the Emperor playing us off against eachother and at the same time be able to count on United States support for the Tsana dam, which we have agreed should be constructed by a united States engineering firm. In view of the importance to neigh-bouring British territories of the frontier adjustments which we have in mind, we should use every endeavour to secure United states support for these at whatever time may be most suitable for puttingthem forward. -7. I recommend the adoption of the third alternative above mentioned andthat we should explore with the Americans the possibility of joint financial andother assistance to Ethiopia. At. the same time we should make it clear to theUnited States, and to the Emperor, that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not contemplate any further assistance until they had been able to carry out an enquiry into the present position in Ethiopia and that therefore they would haveto await the result of the enquiry by the Mission which they had already proposedto send.Foreign Office, lQtk June, 1944.A.
