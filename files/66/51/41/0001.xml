General Review.NAVAL SITUATION.1. Strong winds during the latter part of the week have impeded unloadingin the assault area in Normandy. Allied warships have continued to carry outbombardment in support of the armies.U.S. forces have landed on Saipan in the marinas.. A Japanese battle fleet has been sighted at sea between the Philippines andthe marinas.Three U-boats have been sunk, one probably sunk and one possibly sunk.Home Waters.2. During the earlier part of the week unloading of stores and supplies in the assault area proceeded at a satisfactory rate. Occasional shelling of somesectors caused little interference and bombing was comparatively slight. Onthe 17th the weather, deteriorated and by the 19th a strong northerly breezewas causing breakers on the beaches. On the 20th gale conditions off the beaches stopped unloading and nearly all sailings were suspended. considerable damage was done to auxiliary craft and two tankers were driven ashore.Unloading was still impossible on the following day but an improvement was reported&apos;on the 22nd. The following are the cumulative totals unloaded inthe British and U.S. sectors up to p.m. on the 20th : British : 330,606 men.54,862 vehicles, 106,795 tons of stores. U.S. : 307,439 men, 42,806 vehicles,117,843 tons of stores.3. Naval bombardments have continued. On the 15th, H.M. ships Nelson,Ramillies, A jaw, and Belfast engaged specific targets. On the following day the U.S. battleships Texas, Nevada and Arkansas supported U.S. troops and h.M.S. A jaw shelled enemy armour. British and Allied cruisers, destroyers and L.C.G. were called upon to beat back several enemy counter-attacks. On the19th, H.M.S. Diadem (cruiser) engaged concentrations of armour.4. E-boat activity was on a much reduced scale. Although some E-boats were reported both to the east and west of the assault area, in no case did theypress home an attack. On the night of the 13th/&apos;14th H.M.S. Duff (frigate)damaged a minesweeper off Barfleur and, two nights later, H.M.S. Stayner(frigate) drove off an E-boat north of Cherbourg.5. H.M.S. Nelson was slightly damaged by mine on the 18th. Othercasualties to ships, apart from those reported in Appendix V, are as follows :1I.M. frigates Mourne and Blackwood torpedoed and sunk by U-boat while on anti-submarine patrol on the 15th. H.M.S. Locust (headquarters ship) damaged&quot;by gunfire on the 16th.. s.s. A /irTTveaSl^Fepa:i^ship) mined and sunk on the 16th.H.M.S. Talybont (destroyer) damaged by shore batteries on the night of the16th/17th. H.M.S. Glenroy (L.S.I.) damaged by mine on the following day.H.M.S. Onslow (destroyer) slightly damaged by torpedo aircraft on the night of the 18th/19th. The Erench frigate La Surprise damaged by mine on the20th. H.M.S. Fury (destroyer) severely damaged by mine on the 21st. H.M.S.Ilfracombe (minesweeper) damaged by mine on the night of the 21st/22nd.6. On the 15th, five M.T.Bs. attacked a southbound convoy off the dutch coast. One armed coaster of 600 tons was torpedoed and sunk, a large tug seton fire and a traAvler damaged. On the 18th, four M.T.Bs. engaged and inflicteddamage on a convoy of minesweepers and trawlers east of Jersey.Mediterranean.7. On the 17th, H.M. destroyers and light craft supported and covered a landing on the Island of Elba. H.M. gunboats Cockchafer and Scarab and fiveL.C.G. gave supporting fire. Pianosa Island (south of Elba) was taken without opposition. British naval casualties were approximately 30 killed and 100w-ounded.Coastal forces covering the operations have fought several engagements offElba. On the night of the 17th/18th an enemy force of a destroyer, a corvetteand an F-lighter were attacked : the corvette was left on fire and the lighterprobably torpedoed. On the following night an F-lighter was sunk. On the night of the 19th/20th, five F-lighters with one E-boat were intercepted afterloading : three of the enemy were torpedoed and a fourth possibly sunk.8. Off Spezia on the night of the 14th/15th, coastal forces attacked two destroyers and sank one of them.
At Civita Vecchia enemy demolitions have been so far repaired that largequantities of ammunition and stores can now be landed regularly. The firstLiberty ship berthed alongside on the 20th.9. The French S/M Casablanca probably sank an A/S vessel of 800 tonsoff the south coast of France on the 9th.10. In the Adriatic the French destroyers Le Fantasque and Le Terribleintercepted and sank a convoy of two motor ships and four small craft on the night of the 16th/17th.11. In the iEgean, H.M. S/M Unswerving sank an A/S craft and twocaiques off Mitylene on the 17th.H.M.S. Quail (destroyei-), which was mined off Bari in November, capsizedand sank while being towed to Taranto on the 18th.East Indies.12.   H.M. submarines have reported the following : In the Strait of Malacca, Stoic sank an escorted northbound ship of3,500 tons and Tantalus sank an 800-ton ship by gunfire, both on the 10th;Templar torpedoed and sank a 2,700-ton ship on the 28th May and Tacticiansank two junks; Spiteful shelled the Governors residence on Ross Island, inthe Andamans.Pacific.Mariana Islands.13. On the 14th U.S. forces landed on Saipan under cover of a navalbombardment and bombing by naval aircraft. On the following day an enemyforce of three battleships, including one Nagato class, nine aircraft carriers, tencruisers and eleven destroyers was sighted steering to the eastward from SanBernardino Strait, eastern Philippines. Further sightings of enemy forcesbetween the Philippines and the marinas were made on the 19th and 21st. It has since been reported that the U.S. and Japanese fleets have been in contact butdetails have not yet been received.Bonin Islands.14. On the 15th, a carrier task force which had been detached from themain U.S. fleet flew off aircraft to attack airfields on Ogasawara, Chichijima andIwojima (islands north-west of the marinas). Two enemy ships were sunk and ten damaged and a total of 47 aircraft destroyed in the air and. on the ground.Kwriles.15.   On the 14th, U.S.. cruisers shelled Matsuwa Island.New&apos;Guinea.16. On the night of.the 16th/17th, M.T.Bs. shelled Kariru and MuschuIslands (north-west of Wewak). On the following night three U.S. destroyers bombarded 32 gun positions in the Wewak area.Neva Ireland.17. On the night of the 17th/18th, M.T.Bs. shelled enemy positions on theeast and north-east coasts. Two islands north of Kavieng were also shelled, onthe same night. tAnti-Submarine Operations.18. Twenty-nine attacks have been reported during the week, of which17 were by shore-based aircraft, one by carrier-borne aircraft and 11 by warships.On the 16th, aircraft from the U.S.S. Solomons (escort carrier) sank a U-boatsouth of St. Helena from which 21 survivors were picked up; two of the aircraft were shot down and two others were lost. On the 17th, a Catalina sank one offthe Norwegian coast and on the following day H.M.S. Fame (destroyer) and an escort group sank another off the coast of Brittany. A U-boat was probably sunknorth-west of Finisterre by aircraft on the 7th and H.M.S. Hind (sloop) possiblysank one off Start Point on the 14th.-[27687]b
Enemy Intelligence.19. Photographic reconnaissance on the 19th showed the Gneisenau,lutzow, Hipper, the Koln with her guns remounted, and three Narvik destroyersat Gdynia.   One Schlesien class battleship was seen oft&apos; the port.Further information on the development of Sonderborg, in Denmark,indicates that it has now become the main base for U-boat experiments.Photographic reconnaissance has located the following surface craft inChannel ports : one Seetier destroyer, 2 Elbing destroyers (one docked), one Moewetorpedo boat, 2 corvettes, 15 M. class minesweepers, 9 Sperrbrechers (6 in dock)and about 30 E/R boats, of which 4 are docked and 4 damaged. At Cherbourgthere were a few E/R boats.20. Reconnaissance of Cherbourg on the 15th showed that the tankerSolglimt (12,246 tons) had been sunk to block the entrance to the Darse Trans-atlantique; she appears to block more than half the entrance. The large dry dockwas seen to have been flooded, and subsequent reconnaissances have shownconsiderable and progressive demolition of jetties and quays.U-boats.21. In the Indian Ocean three U-boats are believed to be on patrol atpresent.   The Germans are continuing to increase their force in the area.Enemy Attack on Shipping.22.. One ship, on passage from the Congo to Capetown, was sunk by U-boatnorth-west of the Cape.In the Channel operations, one ship was sunk by air attack off the Isle of wight and another was mined and sunk south-west of the Scillies. One ship was slightly damaged when a convoy passing the Strait of Dover was shelled by coastalbatteries.The Swedish Red Cross ship Fenja (8,268 tons) was sunk by a mine in theeastern ^aegean.Protection of Seaborne Trade.23. During the week ending the 18th, 644 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 185 wrere in ocean convoys and459 in British coastal convoys. Three escort carriers, 31 destroyers (including13 U.S. destroyers) and 71 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employedon escort duties. Two homebound convoys consisting of 119 ships and twooutward-bound convoys consisting of 66 ships reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.24. Surface craft have laid mines off the northern French coast. Aircraftlaid mines off the Frisian Islands, the Dutch coast, the northern French coast,the Channel Islands and the Biscay ports.In foreign wraters, ships laid mines off the west coast of Italy and in theStrait of Malacca.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.25. Off the coast of Normandy aircraft have laid mines on most nights ofthe week and occasionally in daylight. Minelaying by E-boats was suspected on one night in the Strait of Dover. U-boats may have laid mines off the Southand South-West Coasts. Aircraft may also have been minelaying on one nightoff the East Coast and on another in the Firth of Forth.26. In the assault area 185 mines have been destroyed in the western areaalone; complete figures for the eastern area are not yet available. The minetotals are 4,878 ground and 5,094 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.27. During the period 16th/31st May, eight enemy ships totalling14,617 tons were sunk, captured or became total losses, four of these (5,155 tons)in the Mediterranean.  Three ships (5,300 tons) were seriously damaged, all in the
Mediterranean. This brings the amount of shipping lost in May to 22 ships totalling 44,556 tons, of which nine ships (12,742 tons) were lost in theMediterranean. Six ships (23,421 tons) were seriously damaged during themonth.28. Germany is making an increasing use of Danish coastal shipping. Theaverage amount (25,000 tons) for the first four months of 1944 was twice as muchas for the corresponding period of 1943.29. Photographic reconnaissance shows that the amount of dry cargotonnage under repair in Germany and the occupied countries in northern watershas increased by nearly 50 per cent, since February. Tanker tonnage under repair has increased by some 70 per cent. It is reported that eleven salvage ships are now in use on the Norwegian coast.30. The number of German and German-controlled ships isolated in French ports by the operations in Normandy amounts to 35 tankers, of 189,000 tons, and358 cargo ships of 217,000 tons, including ships engaged in the ore trade and insupplying the Channel Islands. With the exception of the s.s. S char lack berger(2,844 tons) which sailed from Bilbao on the 16th, the ore trade has been carriedon chiefly by small ships during the past two weeks.Royal Canadian Navy.31. The strength of the R.C.N. at the beginning of the war was six destroyers and five minesweepers manned by 312 officers and 3,192 ratings.In January 1944 the strength was: one A/A ship, one infantry landingship, 19 destroyers, 15 frigates, 83 corvettes, 63 minesweepers,. 68 motor launches,two base supply ships and over 400 patrol- and auxiliary vessels manned by7,620 officers and 67,169 ratings.Swedish Intelligence.32. The Swedish Government is reported to be strengthening defences andordering a special state of readiness at all ports. Minefields off the south-westcoast of Sweden have been extended and restrictions have been placed onnavigation in territorial waters.MILITARY SITUATION.North-West France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.33. During the past week operations have been primarily directed towardssealing off the Cherbourg Peninsula and towards extending our bridgeheadbetween the Rivers Vire and Orne southwards to the general line St. Lo-Caumont-Villers Bocage.These operations have achieved a considerable measure of success despitefierce and increasing enemy opposition. United States forces, having driven a wide corridor across the base of the Cherbourg Peninsula, have advancedrapidly north and are now attacking the outer defences of Cherbourg itself.Further east U.S. forces are within sight of St. Lo and have secured.a firm holdon Caumont, while, in the Villers Bocage area, British forces have inflictedconsiderable losses on the enemy in the course of very heavy and protractedfighting.)U.S. Sector.34. Very heavy fighting has been taking place throughout the week in theCherbourg Peninsula. In the north of the area, U.S. forces captured Quinevilleon the 15th, thus making available a valuable new exit from the beaches in this sector, and on the 19th succeeded in the face of determined enemy opposition In response-capturing Montebourg, which had changed hands earlier in the week.In their advance to the west coast of the Peninsula U.S. forces made slow progress until the 15th when a considerable advance was made towardsSt. Sauveur le.Vicomte, which was entered on the 16th. Thereafter oppositionslackened and the western coast of the Peninsula was reached on the 18th.  Rapid[27687] b 2
advances to the N.W. and north were then made on the 19th and 20th and bythe 21st our forces were engaged with the outer defences of Cherbourg, whichitself had for many hours been under artillery fire.At the same time the southern flank of the salient was strengthened toprevent the enemy from relieving his trapped formations in the north of the peninsula. Some&quot; small advances were also made south of Carentan on whichUS. troops have retained a firm hold despite repeated and determined enemyattempts to recapture the town.Further to the east U.S. forces have made advances in the direction of St. Loand have reached a point some three miles N.E. of the town. From here toCaumont their line has remained almost unchanged and there has been littleactivity beyond aggressive patrolling.British Sector.35. After the very effective attack by British armour on the 12th which resulted in the capture of Villers Bocage, bitter fighting ensued and, afterinflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, our armour was successfully disengagedand withdrawn to the west of the town. Meanwhile infantry attacked south toattempt to clear the salient Tilly-sur-Seulles-Villers Bocage, but this attackmade slow progress.Throughout the rest of the period the enemy has made persistent and heavyarmoured counter-attacks in this area in an attempt to stem our advance and very heavy and fluctuating fighting has taken place.- However, on the 19th, our forcesmanaged to recapture Tilly-sur-Seulles and Hottot; the latter was subsequentlyrecaptured by the enemy. On the left of the British sector, in the neighbourhoodof Caen, our threat to the town has provoked the enemy to repeated heavy attackswith infantry and armour on both sides of the River Orne, but all their attacks have been repulsed and there have been no appreciable positional changes.French Resistance.36. Since the 6th the French forces of the interior have carried out plansmade prior to D-day for the disruption of rail and road traffic, and of telephone and telegraph communications. Many important railway lines have been cut and bridges destroyed. Electric power lines and canals have also been amongthe targets for attack by the Resisters. Guerrilla warfare has been carried outin many districts with success; the enemy are being forced to mount operations of considerable size to deal with the soldiers of the Maquis. Resistance forces are growing daily, and attempts are being made to supply them with arms.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)37. Our armies in Italy have maintained their advance northwards, and inthe Adriatic sector nearly 40 miles have been covered. Latterly resistance hasbeen increasing, as we came up against the enemy&apos;s delaying position which coversPerugia, which runs astride Lake Trasimene, and extends to the coast north ofGrosseto. Bad weather has also hampered our movements during the last fewdays.In the Adriatic sector the enemy&apos;s withdrawal has been quickly followed upby our troops. The River Vomano was crossed on the 15th/16th, and Teramo was found clear of the enemy on the 16th. By the 19th, the River Tronto had beencrossed and Ascoli captured. By the 20th, our forces crossed the River Tesinoand on the following day Pedaso was reached and leading elements had enteredFermo.In the central sector the advance of the Eighth Army northwards from Terniwent on quickly, and Todi was reached on the 15th. A number of bridges whichhad been prepared for demolition were captured intact. Foligno was reached on \the 16th and Spoleto and Bastia fell next day. Our forces then advanced onPerugia; the enemy offered considerable resistance in this area and stubbornfighting went on for three days before the town itself could be occupied on the20th. Enemy forces axe still strongly opposing our troops and only slight pro-gress north was made on the 21st, when a thrust eastwards was made and Nocerawas occupied. Leading elements of the troops engaged in this attack were lastreported two miles west of Camerino. This advance narrows the gap between our forces on the Adriatic coast and our forces in the central sector of the eighth army front to approximately 30 miles.On the left flank our armour has experienced difficult country, bad weather,demolitions and minefields; nevertheless, with infantry on its right, advances have
been made. Ficulle was occupied on the 15th. Progress was then made up theChiusi road, with a right-handed thrust directed on to Lake Trasimene, thesouthern shores of which were reached on the 19th. Our troops entered Chiusi onthe 20th and on the 21st fighting in and around this town was still in progress,whilst three miles further to the east our infantry were meeting stiff enemyopposition.On the right flank of the Fifth Army, French forces, having overcome enemy resistance around Lake Bolsena, occupied Acquapendente on the 15th. A steadyadvance was then maintained and Radicofani was captured on the 18th, withArcidossa falling on the following day. Since then they have occupied a numberof small villages further to the north against opposition which was at times bitter,with frequent street fighting.On the Tyrrhenian coast U.S. troops have maintained their advance andGrosseto was occupied on the 16th, and on the 20th Paganico and Montepescaliwere occupied. The latter town commands an important road junction whereHighways 1 and 73 meet. Thus the Americans have now available to them twoaxes of advance; these are being exploited and we are now some 15 miles north ofGrosseto along both roads.Elba.38. A task force consisting of French troops landed on the island of Elbaat 0400 hours on the 17th. The main landing was effected at Marina di Campo,and by 0730 hours, four battalions and some commandos were ashore and heavilyengaged with the enemy. By the next day beaches had been cleared and unloadingof stores and vehicles was proceeding. A dominating height in&apos; the centre of the island overlooking Por^o Ferraio was captured.At 1400 hours on the 19th, Porto Ferraio fell and all organised resistance inthe island ceased on the 20th, but shortly after this German commandos landedon the north-eastern tip of the island; they were engaged by the French troops and suffered heavy losses.The Campaign in Russia.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)39. The main weight of the Russians&apos; attack on the Karelian Isthmus hasbeen on the western side, and it is there that they have made their greatestadvance. After breaking through two strongly-fortified defence zones, in front ofthe Mannerheim line, which was the main Finnish defence system in the Isthmus,the Russians have now overrun the line itself&apos; on a front of at least 25 miles,capturing Viipuri on the 20th.On the 21st, the Russians reported that their troops, besides advancingfurther N.W. and^north of Viipuri, had gone over to the offensive betweenLakes Ladoga and Onega, forcing the R. Svir near Lodgnoye Polye (at the river&apos;ssouthern end) and liquidating a Finnish bridgehead in the vicinity of Voznesene(at the river&apos;s northern end). They had also broken through north of Lake Onegaand, having captured Povenets and other places due north of the lake, were fighting in the outskirts of Medvyezhya Cora.Along the rest of the front no fighting of importance has taken place.Yugoslavia.40.   Confused fighting has continued in Western Bosnia.The Germans have resumed their drive southwards from Plevlja (60 miles.E. of Sarajevo) and, having re-crossed the River Tara, have captured Zabljak(65 miles S.S.E. of Sarajevo).The Partisan offensive in the Majevica hills (immediately north of Tuzla)has been repulsed by the enemy who have forced the Partisans to withdrawsouth-westwards. The latter, however, claim to have inflicted 1,500 casulties on the enemy in this area.An Allied party with four 75-mm. guns landed on the island of Solta duringthe night of the 9th/T0th, and shelled the strong point where the Germangarrison was concentrated, inflicting heavy damage. The party withdrewwithout loss the same night.Greece.41. E.L.A.S. forces engaged an enemy raiding force in Macedonia onthe 17th.   They have also sabotaged a nickel mine north of Athens.
An analysis of reports from British liaison officers shows that during May,Greek and Allied operations have accounted for approximately 1,480 Germancasualties in killed, wounded and captured.Burma.Chin Hills and Chindwin.42. Operations to clear the Imphal-Kohima road continue. Advancingsouth from the area of Kohima, British troops have occupied Tuphema without opposition, and are now four miles south of this village. Advancing north fromthe Imphal area our troops are some eight miles&quot;N.E. of Kangiatongbi. The gap between these forces is now reduced to about 26 miles.Chinese/ U.S. Forces.43. On the 17th, after a seven-day siege, Chinese troops captured Kamaing.Mogaung is now virtually surrounded. Further progress has been made in thereduction of the Japanese troops still holding out in Myitkyina.Chinese Expeditionary Force.44. Chinese forces occupied Lungling&quot; on the 12th, but on the 17th theywithdrew to a line six miles N.E. of the town.Pacific Theatre.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)45. On Biak Island, Borokoe and Sorido airfields have been captured by .S. troops. The village of Sorido, three quarters of a mile N.W. of the airfield,has also been captured.On the 15th, U.S. forces landed on Saipan in the marinas. They have captured the airport and are now in possession of about half the island, Japaneseresistance has been fierce.AIR SITUATION.General Review.46. Despite unfavourable weather, great activity was maintained over the battle zone in France. Oil refineries in Germany and Austria were heavily bombed.Heavy enemy attacks, with long-range &quot;flying-bombs,&quot; were made on theUnited Kingdom.  A series of major attacks was made on &quot; flying-bomb &quot; bases.In Italy, attacks were maintained on enemy communications.United Kingdom.47. During daylight, no enemy aircraft crossed our coasts. On the first and last nights of the week, a total of seven enemy aircraft flew over southern england, and five flew reconnaissances over Scotland; one of these latter was destroyed.Note. Reports on enemy attacks with flying bombs will be found inparagraphs 65 to 68.Home Waters.48. During the week ended midnight on the 20th, aircraft of coastal command flew 2,190 sorties, involving 12,900 flying hours.A large number of enemy coastal ships, E-boats and minesweepers was attacked off Channel ports, but poor visibility did not, generally, permit results to be assessed.Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 248 sea-mines.Western Front.49. Although weather conditions showed little improvement, the tonnageof bombs dropped considerably exceeded that of last week, the total reaching30,000 as compared with 18,000 .tons; 1,000 R.P. were fired. Home-based aircraft, other than those of Coastal Command, flew 35,650 sorties. On the20th, 1,957 U.S. bomber sorties were flown and, on three other days, forcescomprising about 1,300 bombers operated on specific missions. Fighter covertotalled 1,027 on one occasion, while from 530 to 780 fighters provided escort on other days. Allied losses remained at about 1 per cent, of the total effort,
i.e., 215 heavy bombers, eight medium and light bombers and 148 fighter-bombers and fighters are missing. The reaction on the Continent by the G.A.F. was mainly defensive; 2,600 sorties are provisionally estimated to have been flown bythe enemy, whose casualties were 210 destroyed, 46 probably destroyed and107 damaged.France.50. Allied air forces contributed a considerable part of their effort tohindering the movement of enemy troops along the network of roads leadingtowards the point of battle and to disrupting the flow of essential supplies. Theenemy&apos;s reinforcements, by the bombing of his strategic railways, roads and bridges, were obliged to take circuitous routes. His airfields were heavily attacked, as were &quot; flying-bomb &quot; bases in the Somme, Pas de Calais and Seine-Inferieure departments. A large-scale attack on Boulogne caused extensive damage to port installations. Formations of fighters on armed reconnaissancesranged as far afield as the Franco-Spanish border and attacked targets overextensive ai&apos;eas south of the Front. Defensive patrols and beachhead cover were maintained over our troops and shipping. In Normandy, there are now 11 Alliedadvanced landing-grounds, from which a number of squadrons operate.The following does not cover all operations, but summarises the trend of the air offensive by showing the tonnage of bombs dropped, on Certain classesof target. Results, so far reported, of a few of the individual attacks are givenin Appendix VII.(a) Communications. Over 5,300 tons of bombs were dropped and 1,000 R.P.fired during 53 attacks on bridges and 20 attacks on railway centres, four of whichwere bombed at night. Several of these targets were situated in central and western France, while others in the battle area, were attacked in support of our land forces. Results of some of the attacks appear in Appendix VII, para-graphs 4, 21, 27 and 30 to 34.(b) &quot; Flying-Bomb &quot; bases. As part of the counter-measures against the bombing of Southern England, heavy bombers and other aircraft of many typesrepeatedly attacked the launching and supply sites. In one attack, 17 x 12,000 lb.bombs were released and, in all, 6,500 tons were dropped, 2,120 tons of which fell at night.(c) Airfields. In 35 attacks, 3,200 tons of bombs were dropped on airfields and a further 300 tons at Bordeaux, where the objective was an aircraft plant.Vide Appendix VII, paragraphs 3, 7, 10, 11, 15. 18 and 19.(d) Fuel storage, Ordnance, &amp;c. During 16 attacks on fuel dumps. 1,784 tonsof bombs were released and 190 R.P. discharged. An explosive works atAngouleme received 180 tons.   Vide Appendix VII, paragraph 16.(e) Mechanised transport, A.F.V. locomotives, &amp;c. About 900 tons of bombs and 71 R.P. were aimed at these targets. Although results in many instancescould not be observed, it is known that 350 mechanised vehicles of various types and a large number of horse-drawn vehicles were destroyed, either as the resultof bombing or machine-gunning; 31 locomotives and 83 railroad cars and truckswere destroyed and about 350 of the latter were damaged.(f) Port facilities and shipping. Boulogne was attacked, on the 15th. when1,310 tons of bombs were released.   Vide Appendix VII, paragraphs 8, 36 and 37.Germany.51. More than 10,000 tons of bombs were dropped on targets in the Reich.Objectives included (a) 15 oil refineries (5,785 tons), (b) aero-engine factories andother targets in and near Berlin (1,780 tons), (c) port facilities at Hamburg(1,100 tons), Bremerhaven (240 tons) and Brunsbuttel (120 tons), (d) a M.T. works( ) (200 tons) and (e) an army tank ordnance depot (100 tons). Paragraphs 39 to 45and 48, Appendix VII, refer to some of these operations.A total of 163 Fortresses, detailed to attack oil plants at Ruhland, 30 miles north of Dresden, was to land at bases in Russia; details are not yet available.On three nights, Mosquitoes bombed Berlin, dropping 40 tons on each occasion.Mediterranean Front.52. During the week ended dawn on the 20th, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 9,408 sorties and dropped 6,193 tons of bombs; 96 allied aircraft were lost and 148 enemy aircraft destroyed.
An analysis of reports from British liaison officers shows that during MayvGreek and Allied operations have accounted for approximately 1,480 Germancasualties in killed, wounded and captured.Burma.Chin Hills and Chindwin.42. Operations to clear the Imphal-Kohima road continue. Advancingsouth from the area of Kohima, British troops have occupied Tuphema without opposition, and are now four miles south of this village. Advancing north fromthe Imphal area our troops are some eight miles N.E. of Kanglatongbi. The gap between these forces is now reduced to about 26 miles.Chinese IU .S. Forces.43. On the 17th, after a seven-day siege, Chinese troops captured Kamaing.Mogaung is now virtually surrounded. Further progress has been made in thereduction of the Japanese troops still holding out in Myitkyina.Chinese Expeditionary Force.44. Chinese forces occupied Lungling on the 12th, but on the 17th theywithdrew to a line six miles N.E. of the town.Pacific Theatre.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)45. On Biak Island, Borokoe and Sorido airfields have been captured by .S. troops. The village of Sorido, three quarters of a mile N.W. of the airfield,has also been captured.On the 15th, U.S. forces landed on Saipan in the marinas. They have captured the airport and are now in possession of about half the island. Japaneseresistance has been fierce.AIR SITUATION.General Review.46. Despite unfavourable weather, great activity was maintained over the battle zone in France. Oil refineries in Germany and Austria were heavily bombed.Heavy enemy attacks, with long-range &quot; flying-bombs,&quot; were made on theUnited Kingdom.  A series of major attacks was made on &quot; flying-bomb &quot; bases.In Italy, attacks were maintained on enemy communications.United Kingdom.47. During daylight, no enemy aircraft crossed our coasts. On the first and last nights of the week, a total of seven enemy aircraft flew over southern england, and five flew reconnaissances over Scotland; one of these latter was destroyed.Note. Reports on enemy attacks with flying bombs ivill be found inparagraphs 65 to 68.Home Waters.48. During the week ended midnight on the 20th, aircraft of coastal command flew 2,190 sorties, involving 12,900 flying hours.A large number of enemy coastal ships, E-boats and minesweepers was attacked off Channel ports, but poor visibility did not, generally, permit results to be assessed.Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 248 sea-mines.Western Front.49. Although weather conditions showed little improvement, the tonnageof bombs dropped considerably exceeded that of last week, the total reaching30,000 as compared with 18,000 tons; 1,000 R.P. were fired. Home-based aircraft, other than those of Coastal Command, flew 35,650 sorties. On the20th, 1,957 U.S. bomber sorties were flown and, on three other days, forcescomprising about 1,300 bombers operated on specific missions. Fighter covertotalled 1,027 on one occasion, while from 530 to 780 fighters provided escort on other days. Allied losses remained at about 1 per cent, of tJhe total effort,
i.e., 215 heavy bombers, eight medium and light bombers and 148 fighter-bombers and fighters are missing. The reaction on the Continent by the G.A.F. was mainly defensive; 2,600 sorties are provisionally estimated to have been flown bythe enemy, whose casualties were &quot;210 destroyed, 46 probably destroyed and107 damaged.France.50. Allied air forces contributed a considerable part of their effort tohindering the movement of enemy troops along the network of roads leadingtowards the point of battle and to disrupting the flow of essential supplies. Theenemy&apos;s reinforcements, by the bombing of his strategic railways, roads and bridges, were obliged to take circuitous routes. His airfields were heavily attacked, as were ct flying-bomb &quot; bases in the Somme, Pas de Calais and Seine-Inferieure departments. A large-scale attack on Boulogne caused extensive damage to port installations. Formations of fighters on armed reconnaissancesranged as far afield as the Franco-Spanish border and attacked targets overextensive areas south of the Front. Defensive patrols and beachhead cover were maintained over our troops and shipping. In Normandy, there are now 11 Alliedadvanced landing-grounds, from which a number of squadrons operate.The following does not cover all operations, but summarises the trend of the air offensive by showing the tonnage of bombs dropped on certain classesof target. Results, so far reported, of a few of the individual attacks are givenin Appendix VII.(a) Communications. Over 5,300 tons of bombs were dropped and 1,000 R.P.fired during 53 attacks on bridges and 20 attacks on railway centres, four of whichwere bombed at night. Several of these targets were situated in central and western France, while others in the battle area were attacked in support of our land forces. Results of some of the attacks appear in Appendix VII, para-graphs 4, 21, 27 and 30 to 34.(b) &quot; Flying-Bomb &quot; bases. As part of the counter-measures against the bombing of Southern England, heavy bombers and other aircraft of many typesrepeatedly attacked the launching and supply sites. In one attack, 17 x 12,000 lb.bombs were released and, in all, 6,500 tons were dropped, 2,120 tons of which fell at night.(c) Airfields. In 35 attacks, 3,200 tons of bombs were dropped on airfields and a further 300 tons at Bordeaux, where the objective was an aircraft plant.Vide Appendix VII, paragraphs 3, 7, 10, 11, 15, 18 and 19.(d) Fuel storage, Ordnance, &amp;c. During 16 attacks on fuel dumps, 1,784 tonsof bombs- were released and 190 R.P. discharged. An explosive works atAngouleme received 180 tons.   Vide Appendix VII, paragraph 16.(e) Mechanised transport, A .F. V. locomotives, &amp;c. About 900 tons of bombs and 71 R.P. were aimed at these targets. Although results in many instancescould not be observed, it is known that 350 mechanised vehicles of various types and a large number of horse-drawn vehicles were destroyed, either as the resultof bombing or machine-gunning; 31 locomotives and 83 railroad cars and truckswere destroyed and about 350 of the latter were damaged.(f) Port facilities and shipping. Boulogne was attacked, on the 15th, when1,310 tons of bombs were released.   Vide Appendix VII, paragraphs 8, 36 and 37.Germany.51. More than 10,000 tons of bombs were dropped on targets in the Reich.Objectives included (a) 15 oil refineries (5,785 tons), (b) aero-engine factories andother targets in and near Berlin (1,780 tons), (c) port facilities at Hamburg(1,100 tons), Bremerhaven (240 tons) and Brunsbuttel (120 tons), (d) a M.T. works(&apos;) (200 tons) and (e) an army tank ordnance depot (100 tons). Paragraphs 39 to 45and 48, Appendix VII, refer to some of these operations.A total of 163 Fortresses, detailed to attack oil plants at Ruhland, 30 miles north of Dresden, was to land at bases in Russia; details are not yet available.On three nights, Mosquitoes bombed Berlin, dropping 40, tons on each occasion.Mediterranean Front.52. During the week ended dawn on the 20th, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 9,408 sorties and dropped 6.193 tons of bombs; 96 allied aircraft were lost and 148 enemy aircraft destroyed.
Adverse weather considerably interfered with air operations. In Italy,attacks were mainly directed on enemy communications and transport. heavy bombers attacked oil refineries in Austria and Czechoslovakia.Italy.53. On three days, air operations were greatly restricted on account of bad weather. Allied aircraft continued to attack road and rail junctions, bridges,viaducts, trains and M.T. At least six bridges were destroyed and hits observedon a number of others. In a successful attack by Marauders, one span of a railwayviaduct at Rapallo (15 miles E.S.E. of Genoa) was destroyed. The railway centre and a factory at Sestri Levante (24 miles N.W. of Spezia) was attacked by 200fighter-bombers. Over an extensive area many railway tracks were cut, and during one operation by Thunderbolts 75 units of rolling stock were destroyed and a further 45 damaged. During the week a total of 205 M.T. vehicles were destroyed and a further 173 damaged. Fighter-bombers secured three hits onan incompleted aircraft carrier in Genoa harbour. Other effective attacks weremade on supply and ammunition dumps, hutted camps and gun positions.On Elba, air support was provided for Allied land forces. M.T. and smallshipping was attacked by Spitfires; Wellingtons made night attacks on the harbours at Porto Ferraio and Porto Longone.During the week, in these operations in Italy, medium, light and fighter bombers flew a total of over 2,500 sorties.South of France.54. Four airfields were attacked by 77 U.S. fighters based on Italy; a topescorting cover was provided by a further 89 fighters. Six enemy aircraft were shot down and nine destroyed on the ground; hangars, locomotives and tankcars were also effectively attacked. From these operations 17 U.S. fighters are missing.Yugoslavia and Albania.55. A successful attack was made by Spitfires on a concentration of M.T.of which 80 were destroyed; other attacks on transport resulted in a further82 M.T. being destroyed and 63 damaged. Other good attacks were made onbridges, small shipping and ammunition dumps. A night attack by30 Wellingtons was made on the railway centre at Nis.Austria and Czechoslovakia.56. Five oil refineries in the Vienna area were attacked by 433 escortedheavy bombers, 882 tons of bombs being dropped. The targets generally were well covered and some good concentrations achieved. Forty-three enemy fighters were shot down and ten bombers and five escorting fighters are missing.The Apollo oil refinery at Bratislava was attacked by 158 heavies which dropped 330 tons; results are reported as excellent. Thirty-one enemy aircraft were shot down for the loss of three Liberators and one escorting fighter.Rumania.57. The railway centre at Timisoara (105 miles N.W. of Turnul Severin)was attacked, at night, by 31 Wellingtons, eight Halifaxes dropping flares.Photographs taken subsequent to the attack showed severe damage to all railwaybuildings.Greece and JEgean.58. Rhodes harbour was attacked almost daily by Venturas and Baltimores.Beaufighters probably sank two caiques, severely damaged a destroyer and securedcannot hits on two escorting vessels. Pilos (Navarino) and the harbour atKalamata were attacked. The Middle East Air Force Command flew a total of443 sorties for the week ended dawn on the 20th.Russia.59. During the early part of the week, in the Karelian Isthmus, a high proportion of the Russian air effort appeared to be directed against Finnishrail communications in advance of Viborg. Later in the week, the Russian airforce strongly supported their attacking troops, and heavily attacked the railcentres of Viborg up to the fall of the City.
The Russian long-range bomber force attacked eight enemy airfields behind the German lines, opposite the West and White Russian fronts. Much damage is reported as a result of these attacks.German air force activity was on a moderate scale, except in theneighbourhood of Jassy, where close support forces have operated in somestrength.Burma.60. Allied aircraft, for the week ended the 20th, flew a total of 930 sorties;three Allied aircraft were lost and six enemy aircraft destroyedTransport aircraft flew 1,693 sorties, carrying 3,082 tons, 1,932 men andevacuated 1,321 casualties.In the Assam-Ohindwin area over 200 fighter bombers and bombers attackedsupply dumps, camps and enemy positions mainly in the Kohima-Imphal area.A total of 77 fighter bombers operated over the Myitkyina area.China Zone.61. Allied aircraft, for the week ended the 20th, flew a total of 614 sorties;eight Allied aircraft were lost and 13 enemy aircraft destroyed. Sixty-seventransport aircraft carried 93 tons.Sixty-seven U.S. Super-Fortresses (B. 29) took off on the 15th to attack theImperial iron and steel works at Yawata (Kyushu Island); 30 aircraft bombed the target dropping 54 tons with results believed to be good. Four other aircraft which reached the target were lost. Reports from the majority of the remainingbombers have not yet been received.A considerable proportion of the Allied effort was directed on targets inthe Changsha/Lake Tungting areas. Considerable casualties were inflicted on enemy troops, and roads, railways and river craft were heavily attacked.In the Yiyang (120 miles W.S.W. of Kaifeng) district, 150 river boats were sunk. At Wuchang (38 miles S.E. of Hankow) a heavy attack by medium and fighter bombers caused considerable damage.

Off Geelvink Bay,eight small freighters were sunk.New Britain.63. Daily raids, in each of which about 50 tons were dropped, were continued on Rabaul. Approximately 300 tons of bombs were released in theRapopo-Tobera sector, particular attention being given to gun positions.Ma\rshalls and Carolines.64. Dublon Island (Truk Atoll) was heavily bombed every day between the12th and 19th; a total of 670 tons was dropped and, in combat, 22 enemy aircraft were destroyed.ENEMY ACTIVITY AND HOME SECURITY.United Kingdom.General.65. During the week, enemy activity against this country has consistedalmost wholly of attacks by flying-bombs (previously referred to as pilotless air-craft); a description is given at. the end of this section. This activity began at about 2340 on the 15th, and has since continued intermittently both by day and night. The total of flying-bombs despatched for the week is 920, of which 680came overland and 193 were destroyed. The total civilian casualties are estimatedat present at 768 fatal, 2,697 seriously injured and 1,065 unclassified. Eight keypoints were seriously affected. Most of the damage was done to residential and business property; in addition 12 schools, 12 hospitals and 4 churches were damaged.[27687] c

Ofthese about a third fell in the central boroughs north and south of the Thames,a third in the outer southwesterly boroughs and the remainder mostly in thesouth-east and east. Croydon, Wandsworth and Lewisham (all large boroughs)had, individually, considerably more bombs than any of the other boroughs;the heaviest incident was in Croydon.Of the incidents outside London about 30 per cent, occurred in Kent,25 per cent, in Surrey, 20 per cent, in Sussex, 12 per cent, in South Essex and theremainder at outlying places as far out as the Colchester area, and near : Ipswich,Saxmundham, Bishops Stortford, Luton, St. Albans, Windsor, High Wycombe,Reading and Romsey.Although in many cases house and shop property has suffered considerably,damage to services of national importance has been proportionately light. Outof eight instances where relatively serious damage was done to factories,production has been suspended in six. Hungerford railway bridge was hit andBowes Park telephone exchange was put out of action; the following hospitalswere damaged: Battersea General, St. Georges, Rush Green Isolation,St. Mary Abbotts, West End, St. Bernards Southall, Hampton Cottage andEvelina Southward.The heaviest casualty total was caused by a direct hit on the Guards&apos;Chapel, Wellington Barracks, during Sunday morning service, when a congrega-tion of some 300 were assembled. The latest figures are 119 killed and 81 injured,rather more than half being service personnel. No other single incident has beenreported with any such severe results, but generally casualties have been high.Outside London, damage to built-up areas has been reported at Waldron(Sussex), at Bexhill, Eastbourne, Walton-on-Thames, Reigate and Chelmsford,but elsewhere incidents were mostly of a minor character.On the night 15th/16th, some of the incidents were reported in London asbeing H.E. and. LBs., and on the 19th H.E. were dropped near Colchester.Flying-bombs (Pilotless A aircraft).68. The German pilotless aircraft can be briefly described as a mid-wingmonoplane of small dimensions and mainly steel construction with an explosivewar-head designed to give minimum penetration and maximum blast, a new andnovel form of propulsion, a control system which enables it to fly at a pre-setheight on a pre-set course and also decides the moment of fall, a range ofapproximately 140 miles, and a speed comparable with a modern orthodox single-engine fighter. The aircraft has been specially designed for ease of productionand assembly.At least two types of German pilotless aircraft have been sent over thiscountry. They are essentially similar, but one has a tapered wing with a spanof 16 ft. and the other a wing of parallel chord, and a span of about 17 ft. 6 ins.
The nose of this second aircraft is probably longer and more pointed.   Thefollowing notes apply in general to both types.The propulsion unit, which is mounted over the fuselage towards the rear,comprises a new form of athodyd (aero-thermodynamic duct) which is morecorrectly termed an impulse duct engine. At the front is a grill containing9 jets (of which three are double jets), and an arrangement of shutters which closewhen the pressure within the tube is greater than that in front of the grill, and open when the reverse condition obtains. There is a single sparking plug, butat present there is no indication as to whether this plug provides for startingonly or for firing each charge. Petrol is fed to the propulsion unit by compressedair from one or two spherical bottles which are carried in the fuselage.The mainplane is&quot;built round a continuous tubular spar which passes through a sleeve extending across the middle of the pressurised fuel tank. The two wingpanels, which are of steel construction throughout, are designed for rapidassembly on the spar.  There are no ailerons and no dihedral angle.In the extreme nose of the fuselage is a compartment for the magneticcompass, which is enclosed in a light-alloy housing. Next is the warhead,equivalent in size and effect to a German SB 1,000 thin-oase bomb (1,000 kg.),aft of which is the pressurised fuel tank, followed by the pressure bottlecompartment. Behind the pressure bottle compartment is the automatic pilot,the main fuel control unit and a master time controller. The radio transmittingset, if carried, is housed immediately aft of the automatic pilot compartment.In the extreme tail of the fuselage are the pneumatic servo motors which operate the control surfaces.Arrangements are made on the control system so that when the pre-set timeof flight has expired, the elevators are depressed and locked in the &quot; down &quot;position by a spring loaded lever which is released by two electrically fireddetonators. The release of the lever also frees two small hinged plates beneaththe lower surface of the tailplane. One of these plates is larger than the otherso that a definite bias is imparted to the aircraft in its terminal dive.A certain percentage of German pilotless aircraft are equipped with a radiotransmitter contained in a small plywood lined metal box. Undoubtedly thepurpose of this transmitter is to provide plotting and wind data.It has not yet been possible to make any reliable estimate of the thrust ofthe propulsion unit, and consequently any assessment of performance must depend on practical observations. There have been well authenticated reportsof true air speeds up to about 400 miles an hour at 3,000 ft. but level flightspeeds at varying altitudes up to that height as reported by pilots and groundobservers show considerable variations.The aircraft is believed to be rocket-launched from a rail approximately180 feet long inclined at an angle of about 6C.[27687]

Amiens \ Longueau Railway Junction. Photographs taken after the bomber Command attack on the 12th/13th June show a concentration of at leastforty-five craters in the target area. The Western approach to the flyover hasbeen cut in two places and almost all the railway lines cut at the junction.2. Amiens I St. Roche Railway Junction. Photographs show that the bomber Command attack on the 12th/13th June severed the through line toAbbeville and both entrances to the goods sidings. The road over rail bridgehas been cut in the centre and hit on the approaches to either end. There are more than thirty-five craters in the goods sidings where all tracks are cut, anda large goods shed has been destroyed. In addition, there is considerable damage to factory premises in the neighbourhood.3. Angers Landing Ground. Photographs, taken after the TJ.S.A.A.F.attack on the 17th June, are partly obscured by cloud but it can be seen that theonly nangar and the G.A.F. Headquarters to the South of the landing groundhave been, affected, the latter severely. There is a large number of craters onthe north-west side of the ground.4. Angouleme Marshalling Yard. Photographs, taken after the TJ.S.A.A.F.attack on the 15th June, show that the yard has been completely devastated and alllines cut in many places. Nearly all the railway facilities comprising locomotivesheds, repair shops, &amp;c, have been either, destroyed or severely damaged. At least100 wagons have been damaged or derailed in the sorting sidings.All three through lines Poitiers/Bordeaux, Angouleme/Cognac andAngouleme/Magnac/Louvre have been cut at many points.5. Arras Marshalling Yard. Photographs, taken after the bomber command attack on the 12th/13th June, show that, round the passenger station,all lines leading to Douai, Lille and Amiens Doulien and Etaples from Arras havebeen cut, and that the turntable near the locomotive sheds has been destroyed.There are 15 craters in the reception sidings and two hits on the centre of a bridgeover the yard.
6.   Aunay-sur-Odon. Photographs,  taken  after  the Bomber  command attack on the 14th/15th June, show that this target, which was believed to contain &apos;concentrations of troops and M.T., has been almost completely obliterated.   Allroad communications have been blocked in every direction.7. Bordeaux I Merignac Airfield. Photographs show that, as a result of theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 15th June, a very large concentration of craters has beenmade in the northern landing area and two smaller concentrations in the southlanding area, while there are some eight new craters on the N.E./S.W. runway.Near the S.W. dispersal area, one of the four hangars has been almost destroyed and two more severely damaged. On the east side of the airfield, four morehangars have sustained some damage and two of the S.N.C.A. hangars have beensimilarly affected.8. Boulogne. Photographs show that the Bomber Command attack on the15th /16th June was well concentrated over the whole of the dock area and that very severe damage was caused to shipping and port facilities. The E/Boatpens have been hit many times and a section of the lower decking measuring100 feet by 40 feet along&apos;the south side of the Bassin Loubet has been destroyed.To the north-west of the pens, all three oil storage tanks have been completely destroyed and a gantry for handling coal severely damaged.Port facilities affected include very severe damage to the Maritime Station,the destruction of the Customs Offices, damage to the lock gates between Portde Maree and Arriere Port, and a large number of craters on nearly every quay.So far as shipping is concerned, it can be seen that 13 vessels measuring from100 to 200 feet in length have been wrecked or damaged and the floating dock inthe Bassin a Flotte has been severely damaged and is almost completely submerged.To the south-west of the Bassin Loubet, railway facilities have suffered severely, the central station being heavily damaged and almost all the buildingscompletely or partially destroyed. Further damage has been caused in the Townmarshalling yard and the railway bridge across the River Lione has received atleast two direct hits.The arsenal to the south of the Bassin Loubet, which had been damaged pre-viously, has now been almost completely destroyed and the adjacent barracks haveap:ain been hit.o9. Bretigny Airfield. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 14th June, show that an aircraft shelter has been severely, and three hangarsslightly, damaged. There are more than 130 craters on the runways and two largeconcentrations on the north-west of the landing ground.10. Chievres Airfield. Photographs, taken after the American attack onthe 14th June, show that a large concentration of craters has been caused acrossthe centre of the landing ground, on the runways and extending into the west and south-east dispersal areas. In the south-west area, one large and one smallhangar and four aircraft shelters have been destroyed and another shelterdamaged. In the west dispersal area, 15 out of 20 shelters have been destroyedwith two more in the north-east area similarly affected. Accommodation buildings have been destroyed.11. Coulommiers Airfield. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F.attack on 14th June, show two large concentrations of craters, one in the eastdispersal area, where several small buildings have been destroyed or damaged,and the other on the runways, where there are more than 100 craters. There isalso a large number of craters on the taxi and perimeter tracks and on the tarmacapron south-west of the airfield.12. Creil Airfield.
