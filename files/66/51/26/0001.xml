(44) 326.17th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.BENGAL.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a letter I havereceived from Mr. Casey about conditions in Bengal.W. S.. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,17th June, 1944.

Government House,Calcutta,My dear Prime Minister, 20th May, 1944.You were good enough to tell me to write to you and I am doing so afterfour months in this post.My task here is all you $id it would be and more.   There is almostindefinite opportunity for constructive work short and long term.   I&apos;ve got to concentrate on the short term to try to ensure that the 60 million people of Bengalare fed and quiet-so as to maintain a peaceful base for Mountbatten.^   ^ There are more problems to the square mile here than in any place that I&apos;vebeen. Many of them are not soluble in to-day&apos;s conditions but there are enoughthat, are possible to tackle, and worth tackling, to make life very full and worthwhile. Once again I am extremely grateful to you for having given me theopportunity to work here.   I could ask nothing better.I do not know how much you remember of this place. In the book about government House I find the following : &apos;&quot; Lord Curzon relates as a point of interest that in 1899 his subsequentcolleague, Winston Churchill, who was very nearly being a member of his staff (presumably as an A.D.C., as he was then only 25 while Curzon himself *was but 39) immersed himself for hours daily in his room in the South-Eastwing writing his book on the Omdurman Campaign.&quot;One&apos;s standards have to be readjusted in India. Things move appallinglyslowly. What would take a week with us, takes a month or two with them-which makes it the more necessary to think well ahead. The administrative machine inthis Province is a sort of Heath Robinson affair that has been built up and addedto and taken from. It is slow moving and inefficient and hopelessly low in numbers and particularly in effectives.   So that one&apos;s weapons are blunt.The country is weighed down with lethargy, self-interest and a lack of civicsense in any form. - Most of the British officials in Bengal are, in consequence,suffering from a sense of frustration and hopelessness to which, fortunately, Ihave not yet succumbed.I am endeavouring to set in motion a constructive enquiry into the wholeAdministrative machine in Bengal, which has proved itself unable to cope with modern conditions.There is no doubt about the bitter schism between the Hindus and theMuslims. It is going on all round, one, all the time above ground and under-ground. I used to think it was make-believe, but it&apos;s not it&apos;s almost a bloodfeud and is likely to intensify as the bait of independence comes closer.I&apos;ve never been in a place before where bribery, corruption and intrigue are accepted as inevitable. There is no sense of public responsibility or civic senseamongst the Indians. I propose to institute an &quot;Anti-Corruption&quot; drive herebefore long. It may be quixotic but I think we cannot tacitly accept thecontinuance of the present reign of venality any longer.Food is the constant and most important problem. One lives from cropto crop.There are probably about 10 million individual rice farms in Bengal, and thetask of getting their surplus rice from such vast numbers of small hoards is clear.Up to now we have adopted a scheme based on the voluntary sale of surplus riceby individual farmers. This is working reasonably well in this year of bumperrice crops, but I am about to have investigated the possibility of a compulsoryscheme of rice acquisition (appallingly difficult though it would be to implement)as the basis of our &apos;&apos; Feed Bengal&apos;&apos; plan for the future.Bengal is probably just self-supporting in rice in a year of good crops.   I([   )   say &apos;&apos; probably &apos;&apos; because agricultural statistics in Bengal up to the present area mixture of guesswork and hearsay. Amongst the many reforms that I am trying to get under way is one to create a proper agricultural statistical organisation.The immense population of Bengal was impressed on me by the fact that they   ,consume well over 1,000 tons of salt a day.The health of Bengal is bad, (although not much worse than the pre-waraverage), and a big proportion of the people are debilitated by malaria andsubject to periodic epidemic ravages of smallpox and cholera. About onehospital bed exists for every 100,000 of the population of Bengal so that when an epidemic is on, it isn&apos;t so good. The only bright spot is preventive treatmentby mass inoculation and vaccination, which we are pressing on with at a great[276.59]
rate. We have vaccinated 20 million people against smallpox in Bengal in thelast six months and will have done 35 million by end of November. Twelvemillion inoculations against cholera have been done in Bengal in the last sixmonths and a great many millions more will be done this year. Malaria is, ofcourse, the greatest curse and you can&apos;t do anything about it except distributequinine. All round, the health of Bengal is only a little worse than the averageof pre-war years.Bengal is the enfant terrible of India in many ways. Financially, thisProvince has had a very bad time in recent years, and has accumulated a heavybudgetary deficit, whilst all the other Provinces of India have piled up surpluses.BengaFs deficit is due to the heavy incidence of the war on the Province, plusfamine and cyclone. I went to New Delhi lately, and represented all this to them and came away, I am glad to say, with the promise of 5^ crores of rupees( 4^ millions).Terrorism isn&apos;t a problem at present-but solely because all (or so we believe)the terrorist leaders are locked up 1,300 of them in Bengal. Of this 1,300, onlya dozen or so are Muslims and only one is a member of the depressed classes. Thegreat bulk is Caste Hindu.I have instituted a &quot; Governor&apos;s Defence Committee &quot; here in order toprovide a relatively high-level platform on which Eastern Command can discussmutual problems with the members of the Bengal Government with myself inthe chair. It is based broadly on the model of the Middle East Defence Committee and is turning out a most useful body.I won&apos;t speak of All-India problems although one gets a good deal morethan a proportionate share of them reflected in Bengal in fact, I sometimes thinkthat the Indian problem is the Bengal problem. I&apos;m getting to the dangerousstage at which I&apos;m beginning to feel that I know something about North-EastIndia.Sir Firoz Khan Noon was quoted here lately as having said to the ImperialConference that . . . . &quot; There are no two opinions in India so far as the mainte-nance of the ties with Britain and the prosecution of the present war are concerned.There is no one in India, not even Mr. Gandhi himself, who does not want theUnited Nations to win. And there are no two opinions about the maintenance,when the war is won, of India&apos;s connection with Britain and with otherDominions.&quot; The Calcutta Statesman criticised this statement as having but little relation to reality and as representing soothing syrup for United Kingdomconsumption. I entirely agree with the Statesman. Indian concern with the waris practically entirely confined to their interest in not being invaded.As to the future, it would be a brave man who would say that the majorityof Indians want to remain within the British Commonwealth. At any rate, thereis a complete lack of expression of any such sentiments in the Indian press. Thevast mass of the dumb millions of India have no views at all other than that theytend to like us and to trust us. The politically conscious Indians (I suppose notmore than a million at the most) have not, so far as, my brief experience goes,shown any indication of interest in anything beyond the lure of &quot; independence &quot; and are rather cagey in expressing themselves on the subject of &quot; dominion status&quot; even in private conversation.I get on well with Wavell and his senior people and with my Muslim LeagueMinisters. I think it is better to keep this Ministry in being than to run the place with direct government by the Governor.I keep close- touch with Mountbatten, Auchinleck and Slim, and with theArmy and Air people generally, including the Americans. The senior people from the Burma front all come and stay with us here on their brief leave in Calcutta.   We all realise that, as soon as the advance into Western EuropeRtSTtiS    trip  BlITTYlfl   fwint   Tiowa   will   ho   r-a^^n^t-^A ^ n - -1    - 1        4-^cu^a,        j^uiinco iiewb win ue ^n,5aicu uu wie ciascmeu advertisementcolumns.Yours sincerely,R.
