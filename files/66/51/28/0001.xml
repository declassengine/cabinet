Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1944. F\3^1    ii ;   &quot;   f,        &quot;   138SECRET. Copy No. *j gW.P. (44) 328.15th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.OIL DISCUSSIONS.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN W.P. (44) 313 the Special Oil Committee have suggested certain&apos; amendments to the draft Memorandum of Understanding (Appendix A toW.P. (44) 269). There are, however, certain further small amendments whichI should like to suggest in order to meet comments on the draft memorandum which have been received from the Canadian and Australian Governments.*These amendments and the general reasons which I have for putting themforward were set out in a letter which I wrote to the Chancellor of the exchequer on the 13th June, the text of which is annexed,.2 - W:M C.  -Dominions Office,15th June, 1944.ANNEX.Text of letter of V&amp;th June to Chancellor of Exchequer.I have seen the draft Report of the Special Oil Committee over which youpresided, and am quite content for the most part with the conclusions reached.There are, however, one or two small amendments which I should like you toconsider in order to help me with the Dominions. As you know, I have receivedtelegrams in the matter from Canada and Australia. The amendments are setout in the enclosed note.The object of the first amendment is to meet the Australian suggestion for greater emphasis on the collective security aspect. I realise that words have been added to paragraph 4 of the Preamble with this in mind; on the other hand, theformer reference to &apos;&apos; collective security arrangements &apos;&apos; in Article I (3) has been replaced by a reference to &quot;military security.&quot; I appreciate the reasons forthis, but, on the other hand, it would be a pity if all mention of collective securitywere to disappear from the operative part of the Memorandum as distinct fromthe Preamble, and a slight&apos;redrafting of Article I (1) could, I suggest, meet thepoint.The second amendment is to meet the further Australian criticism that thedraft as it at present stands may give the impression to third parties that theUnited Kingdom and United States Governments are arranging ,to carve upbetween them the greater part of the world&apos;s oil resources and to impose theresults on other countries. I see that the Committee thought there was littlesubstance in this, but I feel myself that there is some justification for theAustralian view, and the risk of such criticism will be ali the. greater once itis realised that the International Conference foreshadowed in Article II is not* See telegrams from the Canadian Government No. 94 of the 25th May and from theAustralian Government No. 121 of the 30th May, already circulated to the War Cabinet.[27660]
likely to be held for some time to come. The two small amendments which i suggest could, I think, meet the point at no cost to ourselves.The third amendment is simply to prevent misunderstanding on the partof third countries as to our intentions under Article II. The Canadians havealready read this Article as meaning that an early International Conference isin prospect, and I fear that other Dominion Governments may do so also. If,as I understand, this is not in fact in mind, it would I think be desirable tomake an addition such as that suggested in the enclosed note in order both tomake our intentions clear and safeguard ourselves from pressure; and there seemsall the more to be said for this now that the United States have explainedinformally to the producing countries, that steps cannot be taken to call an Inter-national Conference until after the war.Note Enclosed in Above Letter.1.   Amend Article I (1) to read as follows : &quot; That subject to the provisions of such arrangements for. the preser-vgtion of peace and prevention of aggression as may be in force, adequate supplies of petroleum shall be available, in international trade to the nationals of all peaceable countries at fair prices and on a non-discriminatorybasis.&quot;2.   (a) In the Preamble add hew paragraph 5 : ... . &quot; That the general, adoption of.these-principles, can best be promoted by international agreement among, all, countries interested in the petroleumtrade whether as producers or consumers.&quot;(b) The second sentence of Article I to be amended to read as follows :  &quot;To this end, and as a preliminary measure to the calling of an Inter-national Conference as foreshadowed in Article II below, they will concerttheir efforts . . . .&quot;3. Add after &apos;&apos; as soon as practicable &apos;&apos; in line 6 of Article II the words&quot; after the end of the war.&quot;
