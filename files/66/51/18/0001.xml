Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 318.12th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.EMPIRE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I have seen the memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (44) 309) with regard to the future operation of Empire telecommunications-tions Services.2. I entirely concur in the proposal in that memorandum that a detailed examination of the scheme recommended by the Commonwealth CommunicationsCouncil should be undertaken by the Ministers concerned. While I agree that,as stated in paragraph 7 of the memorandum, the scheme raises important political issues, both domestic and international, I greatly hope that these willnot be regarded as presenting an obstacle to its adoption. It is, I think, generally recognised that some measure of reorganisation of present arrangements isessential if the Telecommunications system of the Empire is in future to be developed to the full extent required for all necessary purposes, whether economic,strategic or publicity, and if that development is to take place under Britishand not foreign auspices.3. The only alternative which has been put forward to the proposed schemeis that suggested by Cable and Wireless, Ltd., themselves. This would, for thereasons mentioned in paragraph 6 of the memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer, not be acceptable to the Dominion Governments, whereas the schemeput forward by the Commonwealth Communications Council is strongly supportedby Australia and New Zealand and should not, I think, present difficulties for canada and the Union of South Africa, though they have not so far committed themselves on the subject. Unless some such scheme is adopted, I fear that thereis grave risk of the Dominions breaking away from the existing organisation(which has long been regarded by them as unsatisfactory) and adopting indepen-dent policies, which, from every point of view, would be disastrous.4. I hope, therefore, that the War Cabinet will approve the proposals ofthe ^Chancellor of the Exchequer with a view to a decision as to the adoptionof the scheme, if acceptable to all the other Governments, being taken as early as practicable.C.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,12th June, 1944.3      t i[27637]
