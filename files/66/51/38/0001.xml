Printed foi- the War Cabinet.  June 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 338.20th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE PROPOSED UNITED NATIONS BANK FOR reconstruction and DEVELOPMENT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE forthcoming Monetary Conference at Bretton Woods, besides discussing the proposal for an International Monetary Fund, will also discuss the proposalfor a United Nations Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with the objectof submitting a concrete scheme for acceptance or rejection by the Governments.The American scheme is for a bank with a capital of about  2,500 million. TheUnited States will be expected to contribute 33 per cent, of this; our share shouldnot exceed 10 per cent. ( 250 million), of which-not more than 20 per cent.( 50 million) would be paid up, mostly in the form of sterling, which would notbe drawn upon until required, and as to something like  5 million in the form.ofgold. The remainder of the capital would constitute a surety fund to be called on only in the event of money being required to implement guarantees given bythe Bank for loans raised outside its own direct subscriptions.2. It is most important, both from the point of view of the countries whoseeconomies have been dislocated by the war and from our own point of view, thata Reconstruction Bank should be organised at as early a date as possible. failing this there would be the strongest pressure on us to make advances far beyond what we can reasonably afford. We cannot look to U.N.R.R.A. to provide finance for reconstruction, for the present tendency of the U.N.R.R.A. administration is to concentrate on immediate relief and to give a very narrow interpretationto rehabilitation. Looking further ahead, it is important for the world that a bank should be set up which will enable American money to be adequately andwisely invested in capital development schemes in those countries where capital development is most needed.3. The American plan was published last November, but has not yet been formally discussed between the British and American experts. In order to makethe American scheme acceptable and useful the American proposals needelucidation or amendment in some respects : *(a) Not more than 20 per cent, of the capital should be paid up and used for direct loans, and the balance should be available as a surety fund tobe called upon only in the event of money being required to implementguarantees given by the Bank. The loans so guaranteed would beissued in creditor countries, which to-day means chiefly the UnitedStates. They should be available for purchase not only in the countryin which the loan is issued but in any member country, so that suchloans would be completely untied and might make an important contribution towards maintaining the equilibrium of the internationalbalance of payments. This would make it possible Jor countries whichwish to place orders with the United Kingdom to finance these ordersby loans issued in the United States.(b) The Bank should not be confined to projects of capital development, but should also finance the purchase of raw material and other overseas expenditure needed to restart economic life on the part of countrieswhich have no available exchange resources at the present time.  The[27679]Copy No.
object of these reconstruction loans would be to enable countries with no or inadequate exchange resources to tide over the transition period and to become self-supporting and solvent as rapidly as possible.(c) As regards projects of capital development, it would be a primaryfunction of the Bank to undertake expert examination, having regardto the degree of priority which should be accorded to each project,to the reliability and technical capacity of those who handle the spending of the loan, and to the prospects of the recipient countrybeing in a position to service it in free exchange.(d) It should be clearly understood and generally accepted that no country should be obliged to subscribe to loans sponsored or guaranteed by theBank unless its monetary authority has approved such subscriptionas being within the capacity of the country&apos;s balance of payments atthe time when it has to be made.(e) Our share of the capital should be limited to 10 per cent, so that our share of the paid-up capital would be about  50 million, of which -notmore than  5 million should be in gold.4. If we can secure these desiderata, I think it is very much in our interests that the Conference should draw up a definite scheme for submi ssion to theGovernments. I trust that my colleagues will agree that our delegation shoulddirect their efforts to this end. ,T A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,&apos; 20th June, 1944.
