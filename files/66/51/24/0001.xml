(44) 324.Uth June, 1944.WAR CABINET.OIL DISCUSSIONS.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.THE main purpose of the American proposals is the stabilisation of theproduction and distribution- of oil throughout the world, excluding always theirown domestic production and distribution.2. The United States already controlled world production to the extent of75 per cent., with a larger percentage of world distribution.3. Their distribution system covered, one-third of the consumption of GreatBritain, of the British Empire and of British India.4.   Britain has no market in American territory.5. Britain must act cautiously when confronted with a stabilising agree-ment under such market conditions.6. Petrol consumption is of first importance and the regulation of consumer supplies has always been the object and purpose of the oil.interests.The position of the cartel now proposed would be as follows : In million tons.Total world production of petrol  ...       ...       ... about      90Excluded from cartel U.S. Russia and other countries producing theirown needs and Canada under U.S. wing ...      70Residue available for regulation ...      .......      20Distribution and Sale of the 20 million tons of cartel petrol: Great Britain        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   &quot;   ...        5Empire excluding Canada only ...      ...      ...      ...        38*Balance to France, Belgium, Italy, &amp;c.   ...      - - -      - - -      12Total     ...      .........      ...      .......      207. It would be wrong to say that United States competitors, with three-quarters of the world production and more than three-quarters of the worlddistribution, can enter into a price war or any other form of oppressive competi-tion against Britain, with only 7 per cent, of world production.   &apos;8.   On the contrary, the American producers must inevitably &quot;hold anumbrella &apos;&apos; over the British industry.9. Any other course would be intolerable to them. The American oil .companies dare not sell American oil abroad for less than their domestic price.* United States controlled one-third of this market.[27654]
10. Their export was 16 million tons. The total consumption of Europe was36 million tons.11. Thus it will be seen that a price war would damage the Americans so seriously at home and abroad as to demoralise their industry.12. During the meetings of the Committee we received three messages fromthe United States.   These messages pressed for decisions.13. . The pressure over oil has been insistent and determined. Ever sincethe middle of February there has been a series of threats followed by periods of negotiation, with renewed threats when everything was not going their way.There are extraordinary contradictions in their record. See the telegrams from lord Halifax of the 4th March (No. 1111) and the 5th June (No. 2998) as an example.14. In the United States there has been intense controversy over oil. Thesubject has been discussed at length in the newspapers, in Congress, and by theMinisters. There have been searching enquiries. In consequence, an active andaggressive public opinion exists which has no parallel here.- 15.   For in Britain oil has not become a subject of controversy.B.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1.14:th June, 1944.
