THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.SECRET. Oopy.No.*&quot;W.P. (44) 310.13th Jvffte, 1944./ WAR CABINET.v TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning.IN accordance with the directions of the War Cabinet at their meeting onthe 24th May (W.M. (44) 68th Conclusions, Minute 7 (1)) and with the concurrence of the Reconstruction Committee, I submit a revised draft of the Town, and country Planning Bill.2. The two matters which the War Cabinet had particularly in mind in deciding to postpone further consideration of the Bill (namely (a) the question ofthe 1939 standard and. (&amp;) the question whether the procedure proposed by theBill for the acquisition of land for the redevelopment of war-damaged andobsolescent areas is sufficiently expeditious) have been reconsidered by theReconstruction Committee.The 1939 Standard.3. The Reconstruction Committee unanimously reaffirmed their decision that the provisions of the Bill under which the price payable for public acquisitionof land would in general be based on 1939 prices but could, in the case of certainowner-occupiers, be increased so as to take account of the cost of reinstatement,should stand as drafted (R (44) 44th Meeting, Minute (1), p. 2). The Ministerof Economic Warfare who had an opportunity of supporting his memorandum(R (44) 106) at the meeting of the Committee asked that his dissent from theconclusion should be recorded (R (44) 44th Meeting, Minute (2), p. 2).Procedure for A acquisition.4. On review of this matter the Reconstruction Committee agreed that theprocedure for the compulsory acquisition of land prescribed by the Bill couldbe justified to Parliament as sufficient to meet essential needs B (44) 44th Meeting,Minute (3), p. 4).The Committee were, however, of opinion that the provisions of the bill as drafted were open to the objection that owners might be under an indeter-terminate threat of compulsory acquisition which would inflict hardship on them.The Bill has now been amended with a view to meeting this objection.Amendments made in the Bill.5. The amendments made to meet the point referred&apos; to in the previous paragraph are as follows. Under the draft of the Bill which was before theWar Cabinet when they last considered it, the procedure, both in war-damaged and &quot;obsolescent areas, was that an area would, after a public local inquiry, be&quot; declared &quot; so that thereafter the Planning Authority would have the right toobtain power to acquire compulsorily any land in the area without any furtherpublic local inquiry, but would be under no time limit within which they must seek powers of acquisition.The essence of the amendments now made is to draw a distinction between&quot;blitzed&quot; areas and &quot;blighted,&quot; areas. The Bill now provides that if the planning Authority are of opinion that a &quot;blitzed&quot; area mustbe dealt withcomprehensively and redeveloped as a whole, they must make up their mindwithin a period of five years from the commencement of the Act, i.e., during theperiod for which 1939 prices would run,-what properties within the area they propose to purchase. Further, the owner of any war-damaged property withinthe area may require them to purchase his property (unless they are preparedto permit him to restore it) and the Minister may require them to purchase any[27640]
property within the area, damaged or undamaged, if he is of opinion that theowner will otherwise be damnified.As regards &quot; blighted &quot; areas, there would be no initial &quot; declaration,&quot; nor would there be any obligation to purchase undamaged properties within a periodof five years from the commencement of the Act. There would, however, be thesame obligation to purchase war-damaged properties if permission for restora-tion or rebuilding is refused.Summary of the Main Provisions of the Bill.6. It may be useful to the War Cabinet, to have a brief description of themain provisions of the Bill as it now stands. The immediate purpose of the Bill isto provide for the replanning and redevelopment of &apos;&apos; blitzed &apos;&apos; areas. Tor thispurpose the Bill confers power to purchase all or any of the land in the &quot; blitzed &quot;area (and any land adjacent to it which may be require a to make a properredevelopment unit) and sufficient land outside in an &quot;overspill&quot; area to provide accommodation for persons and businesses displaced by the &quot; thinning-out &apos;&apos; process which will be a necessary part of proper redevelopment.7. The machinery of acquisition will be speeded-up, both in regard to theprocedure for obtaining the actual powers to acquire the land, and also in regardto the subsequent steps necessary before the land vests in the Planning Authority.As regards the former, the main change from existing procedure is that under theBill the Planning Authority will not, as under the existing law, be required to seek out all owners and inform them by individual notice of the application for compulsory powers. This, as the Uthwatt Committee point out, is the cause of most serious delay.As regards the steps subsequent to the grant of powers of acquisition, thenew procedure provides for entry, and the vesting of the land in the planning authority, after due notice to the occupier but without the delay inherent in thelegal formalities for transfer under the present system. A good deal of the com-complexity &quot;of the draft is due to the fact that these reforms can only be expressed byspecific amendments of the Lands Clauses Acts, which are antiquated for thepresent purpose.8. Further, the Bill provides for financial assistance to Planning Authoritiesover a period of ten years to help them over the lean years in dealing with their war-damaged areas.9. While, however, the immediate purpose of the Bill is to provide powers for dealing with- &quot; blitzed &quot; areas it also provides powers for the longer-term problem of dealing with &quot;blighted&quot; areas. Such powers have been promisedboth in The King&apos;s. Speech and in many Government statements. The UthwattCommittee in their final Report (para. 145) recommended that powers shouldbe given without discrimination both for war-damaged and for obsolete areas and said that they regarded the task of securing the redevelopment of the latter asalmost equally urgent.10. The Bill discriminates between &quot; blitzed &quot; and &quot; blighted &quot; areas in,therespects mentioned in paragraph 5 above and, moreover, makes no provision &quot;for financial assistance for the redevelopment of &quot; blighted &quot; areas, but the imp rove-men ts in the actual machinery of acquisition are made aVailabe by the Bill for&quot;blighted &quot; as well as for &quot; blitzed &quot; areas.11. The provisions in regard to the 1939 standard will have effect for aperiod of 5 years only. They apply to public acquisition for any purpose but, as pointed out in paragraph 5, they are likely in practice to apply almost entirely tothe purchase of land in &quot;blitzed &quot; and associated &quot; overspill &quot; areas and not tothe purchase of land in &quot;blighted &quot; areas. The very considerable areas of landlikely to be purchased for housing (not all in &quot; overspill &quot; areas) will, however, be purchased, under the provisions of the Bill, at the 1939 price.12. I hope that the War Cabinet will authorise me to give noticeimmediately of the introduction of the Bill. Amendments in detail may still berequired. I will do my best to make such amendments before the Bill is printedand, if that is not possible, will make amendments in Committee.W. S.
