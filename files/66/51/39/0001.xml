Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.SECRET. Copy No. 36iW.P. (44) 339.23rd June, 1944. \/WAR CABINET.NINTH REPORT OF THE SHIPPING COMMITTEE.1. In our Eighth Report^) we said that, while sufficient shipping was available to enable 12 million tons to be/imported into this country during thefirst half of this year, shortage of.port facilities, and strain on internal transport,might impede the distribution of these imports. Events have bettered ourexpectations and it now appears likely that imports may amount to about12^ million tons. Port capacity has, nevertheless, been a limiting factor, and inaddition there has been a shortage of cold storage which is mainly responsiblefor some 20 ships being at present held at anchorage.2. The approximate Departmental division of these imports, and theprobable effect on mid-year stocks are shown in the following table: Table I.. . January-June 1944.(000,000 tons).     -Net StockConsumption       Change Stocks, Stocks,Imports.      of Imports.     (Jan-June).     mid-1944.      mid-1943.Food    ...       ......      5-25 6-02 -    -77(a) 6-85(a) 6-03(a)Materials        ...     &quot;...      6-00 7-00 - 1-00 12-84 12-49Munitions, &amp;c. ...      1-25 1-25 ... ...12-50 14-27 - 1-77(*) Excluding stocks on farms.It will be noted that stocks of food and materials combined are expected to be substantially higher at mid-1944 than at mid-1943. It should, however, bekept in mind that food stocks bear a liability to S.H.A.E.F. of up to 608,000 tons to meet initial requirements of the civilian population of liberated territoriesThis liability is not specifically allowed for here on account of the uncertainty of its amount and timing.(2)3. If the position at mid-year is more&quot; favourable, the import prospects forthe third quarter are less favourable than during the same period last year.The effect of military operations on United. Kingdom port capacity and, inparticular, the Supreme Allied Commander&apos;s desire to secure discharge of opera-(x) W.P. (44) 225.(2) The commitments to S.H.A.E.F. are as follows:  (a) To provide up to 251,000 tons of foodstuffs during the period of military operations,and(b) To provide up to an additional 357,000 tons of foodstuffs on collapse followingoperations.Thus, in the event of a collapse following operations, S.H.A.E.F. could call upon United Kingdomstocks of food to the amount of 608,000 tons in all.These obligations have no time limit, but the Ministry of Food has the right to give 90 days&apos;notice that it cannot meet any particular commitment.In return, S;H.A.E.F. undertakes to make direct shipment to liberated areas as soon aspracticable, and to use the supplies in the United Kingdom only during the period when directshipment is not possible. .This agreement is subject to-confirmation by the Combined Civil Affairs Committee in washington. \ &apos;
tionally-loaded Bolero ships in excess of the number originally planned, havemade it necessary to limit dry cargo imports during the third quarter of this,year. Shipping dispositions are therefore being made with the object of limiting-imports in July.to some 1-9 million tons, and in August to some 2 million tons.For September it is hoped that conditions will permit a target of somewhat over2-3 million tons. With the proviso that all such estimates, particularly in presentconditions, are subject to a wide margin of error, it is thought that these plans,which envisage an import of some 6^ million tons over the three months, willgive a short-term relief by postponing, until the last quarter of the year, up to500,000 tons of imports which, according to the normal phasing of the year&apos;programme of 25 million tons, would have been brought in during the thirdquarter.4.   It is not possible, as yet, to say precisely what proportion of the^ million-ton import in the third quarter will accrue to the various Departmentali programmes, but on the assumption that 2-8 million tons accrue to food,2-85 million tons to materials, and -60 million tons to munitions, &amp;c, the position at the end of the quarter will be as shown in the following Table :- Table II.July-September, 1944.(000,000. tons)Net Stock Stocks, Stocks,Consumption       Change end- end-Imports,     of Imports.     (July-Sept.).    Sept. 1944.    Sept. 1943.Food..........      2-80 2-81(b) -    -01(a)(b)     6-84(a) (b)     6-79(a)Materials        ......      2-85 3-68 -    -83 12-01 13-59Munitions, &amp;c. ...        -60 -606-25 7-09 -    -84(a) Excluding stocks on farms.(b) No account has been taken of any demands arising out of the S.H.A.E.F. commitment,see page 1, footnote (2).(Details regarding the estimated - net consumption and stocks of food and materials duringthe third and fourth quarters, analysed by commodity groups, will be found in the Appendix).5. It will be observed from Table II that, during the third quarter, stocksof food are expected to fall almost to last year&apos;s level. If the Ministry of Foodwere called upon to fulfil their maximum obligation to S.H.A.E.F., referred toin paragraph 2 above, in the third quarter, food stocks would fall by endSeptember to a level more than half a million tons below that of September 1943,but would rise again in the fourth quarter. The substantial reduction inmaterials stocks during the third quarter is mainly accounted for by the factorsmentioned in paragraph 7 below.6. It is still too early to predict the course of imports in the fourth quarterof this year. The availability of shipping for importing purposes- will largely depend on operational demands, but as far as can be seen at the present time it is not unreasonable to expect that the 25 million-ton import programme willbe fulfilled. The following Table shows what the stock position will be like atthe end of the year if the 25 million-ton programme is divided in the manneragreed by the importing Departments : Table III.January-December, 1944.(000,000 tons).Net      -        StockConsumption       Change       - Stocks,        Stocks, .Imports.     of Imports. &apos;  (Jan.-Dec).     end-1944.      end-1943.Food     .........    10-85.        ll-33(b)(c)     -    -48(a) (b)     7-14(a)(b)     7-26(a)Materials        ......     11-65 14-31 - 2-66 11-18        * 13-84Munitions, &amp;c. ...      2-50 2-5025-00 28-14 - 3-04(B) Excluding stocks on farms.(b) No account has been taken of any demands arising out of the S.H.A.E.F. commitment,see page 1, footnote (2).(b; This does not include any allowance sucn as was included in the estimate of food import requirements made in our Seventh Report, for extra feeding-stuffs for livestock see W.P. (44)37,paragraph 10.
7. Stocks of materials will, as at present programmed, continue to fallsubstantially during the fourth quarter. The stock decline over the year as awhole (2 - 66 million tons) is largely attributable to the fact that home productionof steel in 1944 is now planned to be some 1-7 million ingot tons (12^ per cent.)lower than was originally estimated (in our Seventh Report)^1) As a result, itis expected that stocks of materials(2) will, by the end of the year, reach the lowestrecorded level since the beginning of the war.p) W.P.

For this reason the figures for aggregatefood stocks at end-June 1944 and end-September 1944 respectively are somewhat different from those given in Tables I and II of the Eeport.
