THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 302.7th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.OFFER BY THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON TO THE GOVERNMENT OFPART OF APSLEY HOUSE AND THE WELLINGTON HEIRLOOMS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Duke of Wellington has offered to place at the disposal of theGovernment a substantial part of the accommodation in Apsley House,Park Lane, together with a selection of the pictures, plate and relics originallythe property of the First Duke, to constitute the &quot;Wellington Museum,&quot; forexhibition to the public. The terms of the offer are set out in the attached memorandum (Annex I) and letter (Annex II). The premises comprise part ofthe Duke of Wellington^ Parliamentary Estates, which were settled upon theFirst Duke and his Successors by various Acts of Parliament in the early partof the last century. These Estates are vested in a body of Trustees, including three Parliamentary Trustees, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the House ofCommons and myself. The proposal has not yet been considered by the Trusteesas such.2. Apsley Plouse, designed by Robert Adam in 1771 and still retaining in three rooms the Adam decoration, is one of the last surviving examples of theprivate palaces &apos;&apos; of London, and of those which survive undamaged it isprobably the finest. With the pictures, plate and other heirlooms so exhibitedas to avoid the museum atmosphere, it could provide a splendid setting forGovernment receptions, for which the existing facilities at Lancaster House arenot altogether satisfactory.3. The Directors of the National Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum,the National Portrait Gallery and the Wallace Collection have been consultedinformally, and they strongly recommend the acceptance of the Duke&apos;s offer. Theheirlooms comprise pictures of great value, a magnificent collection of plate,jewellery, the Duke&apos;s Orders, batons, uniforms, &amp;c, and other historical exhibitswhich will, in the opinion of the various Directors, constitute a very complete and interesting record of the First Duke and his time. This collection will obviously gain greatly in interest by being exhibited at Apsley House, which isstill largely in the condition in which the First Duke lived in it.4. If the offer were accepted, the house would require extensiveredecoration and repair as well as modern heating, lighting and sanitaryinstallations. The cost of the work is estimated tentatively at  25,000. Theannual expenditure in maintaining the building and providing for the custody of the exhibits might be of the order of  6,000 a year. The rental values of the space in Apsley House to be handed over to the Government and of that to beretained by the Duke are estimated at  1,750 and  1,250 respectively. The rates on the latter would be about  550.5. The loss of revenue involved by accepting the gift would be small, becauseEstate Duty on Apsley House is relatively light, and the collection is for themost part exempt from duty already.6. I have consulted the Minister of Works and we are agreed that theoffer is one that should be accepted, subject to the agreement of the Trustees andto satisfactory arrangements on points of detail. But as it will probably involve legislation, I seek the concurrence of my colleagues before proceeding further.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,7th June, 1944.Copy No. o[27604]
ANNEX I.Outline of Scheme for Handing Over Apsley House to the Nation.The Duke of Wellington makes a free gift, subject to conditions as statedhereafter, of his rights over the fabric and site of Apsley House to the Nation.He also gives the Wellington Heirlooms, or such of them as the Trustees mayselect, for exhibition in the house. All heirlooms not required by the Trusteesto be retained by the family. The house to be called the &quot; Wellington Museum,&quot;Apsley House.2. The gift is conditional on the family retaining for its use, free of rent and rates, part of the basement, part of the ground floor, the 2nd and 3rd floors.The family will use the present side or garden entrance on the west side ofthe house.3. The Government will be responsible for the upkeep of the fabric. the family will carry out tenant&apos;s decorative repairs in its part of the house.4. The Duke also gives certain property not on the heirloom list to beexhibited in the house.ANNEX II.Copy oe a Letter dated the 3rd April, 1944, from the Duice of Wellingtonto the Ministry of Works.Many thanks for your letter of the 30th March.2. I take this opportunity of recapitulating in writing what I have statedverbally as regards what is embraced in the gift. It includes all the heirloompictures in the Apsley House catalogue except family portraits and portraits offriends of the First Duke, e.g., Lady C. Greville, Lady Jersey and so on. Ofcourse, all the military portraits in the yellow drawing-room are included. Ipropose also to offer the kitkat-size portrait of the First Duke by Lawrence andthe large equestrian portrait by Goya. These are by far the most importantportraits of the Duke, but I am not sure that either is on the heirloom list which you have. They are neither of them in the Apsley House catalogue. I do not include in the gift the portrait of the Duke as a very young man by Hoppneras I regard this as a family portrait.   So much for pictures.3. All the historical and presentation plate on the heirloom list is included, but it is understood that duplicates and plate which it is not desired todisplay should be retained by the family. The same principle applies to thepictures.4. All the First Duke&apos;s orders, batons, jewelled swords, &amp;c, are included.The cameo Garter badge, stated to have belonged to Charles I, is not included.It is of very doubtful authenticity and was bought by the Duke from his brother.It has nothing to do with his public life. A selection of the best of the presentation snuff-boxes, &amp;c, is included. . There are a vast number and I feel sure that it will not be desired to show them all. I should like to keep someof them.5. Presentation china is included with the same proviso as applies to theplate.6. Wearing jewellery and books are not included. I have not got theheirloom list, but I believe there are some books in it.7. I will include in the gift, if desired, a selection of the First Duke&apos;swearing apparel and personal relics of that sort.(Signed) WELLINGTON.P.S. Furniture now in the rooms in question is included with the sameproviso as the plate and china.
