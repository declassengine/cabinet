Proposals based on the recommendations of the Uthwatt Report for thepublic acquisition of development rights and an annual levy on site values wouldbe hotly contested in Parliament; and the Committee have, therefore, sought analternative solution which might command a more general measure of support.After long deliberation, they have reached agreement on the scheme outlined in the attached draft of a White Paper. This is admittedly a compromise between the widely differing views which are held on this subject by differentmembers of the Committee. * But those views reflect a similar divergence ofopinion in Parliament and in the country; and no scheme which was not a corn-promise would be likely to prove generally acceptable.3. The Reconstruction Committee are unanimous in commending thisscheme to the War Cabinet for early presentation to Parliament -not as repre-senting the Governments final views, but, as is made clear in the Foreword to theWhite Paper, in order to focus public discussion of the issues involved, and to assure themselves that there would be a substantial measure of public support fora solution on these lines.4. The principal features of this scheme are summarised in paragraphs15-18 of the White Paper. The main proposals for dealing with the questionsnot covered by the Town and Country Planning Bill (W.P. (44) 310) are asfollows :  -(i) The development rights of the landowner remain vested in him but cannot be exercised until approval of a proposed development or redevelopment has been obtained,(ii) When approval has been obtained, the landowner will pay a BettermentCharge if the value of the land has been increased by the approval.(iii) If approval is refused, the landowner will receive fair compensationunless under the existing law he would not be entitled to it.(iv) Fair compensation means? compensation for loss of development valueexisting on the 31st March, 1939. No compensation will be paid for loss of any development value accruing after that date.(v) The precise formula for determining fair compensation will be settled after a period of 5 years. More information will then be availableto assist the Government in avoiding the payment of any excess overfair compensation due to the element of &quot; floating &quot; value.(vi) Land will be divided into three classes : V green &quot; land, &quot; white &quot; land and built-on land (paragraph 31 of White Paper).[27627] &apos;
(vii), The finances of compensation and betterment will be centralised and planning policy so administered as to secure that, over a reasonable period of years and over the country as a whole, total payments inrespect of fair compensation broadly balance total income fromBetterment Charge.5. On behalf of the Reconstruction Committee I invite the War Cabinetto authorise the Minister of Town and Country Planning and the Secretary ofState for Scotland to present the White Paper to Parliament forthwith.W.4, Kichmond Terrace, S.W. 1.10th June, 1944.

THE CONTROL OF LAND USEFOREWORDProposals for controlling the use of land, are bound to raise again issues which for many years have been the subject of keen political controversy.The Government recognise that no proposals on this subject on which widelydivergent views are held with conviction can be wholly satisfactory to allshades of opinion. They think it important, however, that a determined effort should now be made to find some practical solution of these problems, sothat the physical reconstruction of our towns and countryside after the war may go steadily forward. Moreover, they believe that the collaboration ofall Parties in a National Government offers a fresh opportunity for findingsome common measure of agreement on a question which has in the pastdivided political opinion. It is for these reasons that the Government havemade a prolonged and detailed search for a solution which might prove broadly acceptable. They believe that the scheme outlined in this Paper provides thebasis for a practical system whereby individual rights of land tonure maybe. reconciled with the best use of the land in the national interest. Theypresent this Paper to Parliament in order to focus public discussion of the difficult issues involved and to assure themselves that there would be a sub-stantial measure of public support for a solution on the lines proposed.
77I. INTRODUCTIONI. Provision for the right use of land, in accordance with a. consideredpolicy, is an essential requirement of the Governments programme of post-war reconstruction. JSew houses, whether of permanent or emergency con-structjon; the new lay-out of areas devastated by enemy action or blightedby reason of age or bad living conditions; the new schools which will berequired under the Education Bill now before Parliament and under theScottish Education Bill which it is hoped to introduce later this Session;the balanced distribution of industry which the Governments recently pub-lished proposals for maintaining active employment envisage; the iequire-ments of sound nutrition and of a healthy and well-balanced agriculture;the preservation of land for national parks and forests, and the assurance tothe people of enjoyment of the sea and countryside in times of leisure; a new and safer highway system better adapted to modern industrial and otherneeds, the proper provision of air-fields all these related parts of a singlereconstruction programme involve the use of land, and it is essential that their various claims on land should be so harmonised as to ensure for the people ofthis country the greatest possible measure of individual well-being and nationalprosperity. The achievement of this aim is an interest of all sections of thecommunity, both in this and in succeeding generations. The government desire to make that achievement possible.2. The use of land has long been subject to some form of control in thepublic interest. In particular, between 1909 and 1932 the new concept ofplanned use began to take legislative shape in successive enactments. Never-theless wrong use of land continued to result in much loss, both to individuals and to the nation, of well-being, of time and of money. Good agricultural land was unnecessarily wasted, and the appearance of the country spoiled,by sporadic and unsightly building; public authorities were put to undueexpense by the need of supplying water and other services to households-strung out along the principal highwaj^s; road accidents (especially amongchildren) were multiplied; valuable hours were lost each working day, andthe traffic of great cities congested, because of the distance at which workerslived from their work; the standard of health was affected, and decency ofliving impaired by over-crowding.3. There is general agreement about the defects in the law and administra-tion of town and country planning to which these failures to make the best use of land before the war could largely be attributed. The Barlow*, Scotttand Uthwattf Reports, considered together, contain an exhaustive analysis of those defects. The Government have already taken some remedial measures. Early in 1943 a Ministry of Town and Country Planning was established, under a Minister charged by Parliament with the duty &quot; ofsecuring consistency and continuity in the framing and execution of a national policy with respect to the use and development of land throughout Englandand Wales.&quot; The Secretary of State for Scotland was given similar duties in respect of Scotland. Later in the same year, the English and ScottishTown and Country Planning (Interim Development) Acts extended planning control to the whole of Great Britain and strengthened in important respects the powers of the Minister of Town and Country Planning, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and Local Planning Authorities to prevent developmentprejudicial to good planning.* The Royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population(Cmd. 6153).t The Committee on Land Utilisation in Rural Areas (Cmd. 6378).&apos;   j The Expert Committee on Compensation and Betterment (Cmd. 6386.)35045 A 2
4. These measures were directed, in particular, to correct the followingdefects in tie pre-war system:  (a) Planning schemes were purely local in character. They were primarily the responsibility of Local Authorities who&apos; were not requiredto piy regard to considerations outside their immediate areas, and thepowers of the Ministers responsible for exercising central supervision werenot such as to enable them in practice effectively to secure modifica-tion of local schemes in order to meet regional and national interests.(b) The use of planning powers was optional. Local Authorities were under no obligation to use them, and many did not.5. The Government believe that further measures are needed to meet otherdefects in the existing state of the law. First, therefore, they have presented a Bill to Parliament designed to provide dn England and Wales for special needs arising directly out of the war; this will be followed later in the Sessionby a corresponding Scottish Bill. The enactment of these measures willenable Local Authorities to secure the redevelopment both of devastatedand of obsolescent areas on sound planning lines. But there will still remain to be corrected what is generally agreed to be the defect which mostof all prevented or distorted good planning before the war namely the stateof the law regarding the payment of compensation to landowners affectedby planning schemes, and the collection of &quot; betterment &quot; from those whobenefit therefrom.6. The present Paper is therefore mainly devoted to the considerationof this problem of compensation and betterment.II. THE PROBLEM7. The Uthwatt Committee was appointed in January, 1941, &quot; to make an objective analysis of the subject of the payment of compensation and recovery of betterment in respect of public control of the use of land &quot; and&quot; to advise .... what steps should be taken ... to prevent the work of reconstruction . . . being prejudiced.&quot; The Committee issued an InterimReport in April, 1941 (Cmd. 6291) and a Final Report in August, 1942(Cmd. 6386). This Final Report contains a great many detailed recom-mendations for amending the existing law relating to the assessment ofcompensation, but the peculiar value of the Report lies in its masterly analysis of the abstruse problems lying at the root of any effective system of townand country planning. The Government are greatly indebted to the Com-mittee for this notable contribution.8. Taking first the question of undeveloped land, the Committee pointout that land near towns and cities presents a specially difficult problem.Such fringe land usually commands a high value for building purposes but,nevertheless, often ought to be preserved for agricultural use or for &quot; greenbelts &quot; or other amenities. The individual owner naturally wants to applyhis land to the most profitable use for which he can find a market, andif, for planning reasons, he is prevented from doing so, he is usually entitled,under present law, to be compensated by the Local Planning Authority forthe loss of his prospective profit.9. The problem does not, however, end there. The Uthwatt Committeedraw attention to two things. . First, the development value of undevelopedland, d.e., that part of its market value which is in excess of its value ifpermanently restricted to its present use and reflects the chance that it maybe selected for development, is spread over many more acres than will be
actually required for development in the near future or are ever likely tobe developed. It is the uncertainty as to where the value may settle whichtrives rise to the factor termed &apos;&apos; floating value &quot;. If the value for potentialuse of each piece of land is assessed separately,, the aggregate of thesevalues is certain, under accepted principles of valuation which have referenceto actual sales in the vicinity, to be greatly in excess of the value whichwould be put upon the area if valued as a whole.io. Secondly,&apos; the Uthwatt Committee point out that although the preven-tion of development on one piece of land may reduce the individual valueof that particular land, the real result is not usually to destroy value but merely to shift lit elsewhere. Development values only exist because theland may be put to a different and more profitable use; they are the resultof a demand for land for houses, shops, factories and the like; and that demand is not necessarily decreased by a restriction against building on onepiece of land or in one area. If the development cannot take place on onepiece of land it will probably take place on land elsewhere, and the owner of that land will secure a benefit. But, as the Uthwatt Committee show,it is quite impossible to trace this shift of value in order to collect fromthe owner the &quot; betterment &quot; which under the present law is recoverableby the Local Authority.n. These two factors are, in the view of the Uthwatt Committee, the coreof the problem so far as concerns the unbuilt-on land outsidetowns; and, in their view, the only effective solution lies in the unification in the State of all development rights in such undeveloped land.As regards towns and cities, the practical problem is somewhat different,and they point out that it is essential to invest the Planning Authority with power to &quot; cut through the tangle of separate ownerships and boundary lines &quot;in order that the land may be available for comprehensive redevelopment insuitably sized units. The Committee accordingly recommend that the LocalAuthority should have power to purchase compulsorily the whole of anyareas needing redevelopment, in order to be able to lay them out afresh.They further recommend that a levy on betterment should be imposed at regular intervals.12. Such are the main features of the Uthwatt Report. Summarised in extreme brevity, the three most important recommendations may be stated asfollows:  (i) Undeveloped Land Outside Town Areas.(a) The immediate vesting in the State of all rights of development.(b) The payment&apos; of compensation to owners for the resulting loss ofdevelopment value on the basis of a fixed single sum representing the fair value to the State of the development rights taken as a whole anddivided among owners in proportion to the estimated development valueof their individual holdings at 31st March, 1939.(c) The purchase by the State, iif necessary by compulsion, of all land,with trifling exceptions, at the time of its development, followed by a lease of the land to the developer for an appropriate term at an appro-priate charge.(2) Developed Land.- The purchase by the Planning Authority by a more simple and expeditiousprocedure of any areas requiring redevelopment as a whole, at a pricenot exceeding sums based on the value of the land at 31st March, 1939.
(3) Betterment Levy.The imposition of a levy of 75 per cent, of any future increase in annualsite value of&apos; land when developed.13. The Government accept as substantially correct the Uthwatt Com-mittee&apos;s analysis of the problems with which their Report deals. Therewould, however, be serious practical difficulties in adopting as a whole theparticular proposals suggested by the Committee for solving those problems.These difficulties may be summarised as follows:  (a) The recommendations provide substantially different treatment for(i) owners of undeveloped land outside town areas;(ii) owners of undeveloped land inside town areas;(iii) owners of developed land.In view of the Government it is desirable to avoid such a diffeientia-tion of treatment as far as possible.   tf(6) the demarcation of &quot; town areas &quot; for the purpose of determiningon what land the development rights scheme shall operate has been shown,by experiment, to present a formidable administrative task; and, inasmuch as an owner would gain or lose according to which side of the line his landfell, it would give rise to much controversy and dissatisfaction.(c) The basis of compensation proposed by the Uthwatt Committee fol-lows closely that incorporated in the Coal Act, 1938, but it presents great difficulties in its application to land in view of the very different problems involved, the varying magnitude and large number of individual interests,the lack of data on which to base valuations, and the present uncertaintiesof future development and future values.(d) The scheme for a levy of 75 per cent, of increases in annual site value would be extremely complicated in operation, and its efficacy, from therevenue-producing point of view, is open to doubt. Moreover, the levyis proposed even on increases which have not in fact been realised in cash form by the owner, and on increases which may already have been paid for by the owner, as for example if he has bought land with a viewto more intensive development later on, for which he may even have obtained express planning permission.14. The Government accept in principle the recommendations of the UthwattCommittee regarding the public acquisition of land in areas requiring re-development as a whole, and provisions for this purpose are included in theBill now before Parliament. For the reasons outlined in the preceding para-graph, however, they find themselves unable to adopt the Committee&apos;s detailed proposals for dealing with the problems of compensation and betterment. Afterthe most careful consideration the Government put forward the following general scheme as that to which, in their view, detailed proposals should conform. They present this description of the scheme in order that parliament and the public may have an opportunity for full discussion of these far-reachingmeasures before detailed proposals for further legislation are formulated; andthey will take their final decisions in the light of those discussions.III. SUMMARY OF THE GOVERNMENTS GENERAL SCHEME15. The Minister of Town and Country Planning, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and Local Planning Authorities need to be armed with effective powers, not only to control development and redevelopment, but also tosecure that approved development and redevelopment are carried out on theright land and at the right time. So far as is possible these powers shouldbe similar for both developed and undeveloped land.
16. The general scheme put forward by the Government would includethe following main, provisions:  Powers of Public Acquisition.(si) The power of public purchase of land will be made available toLocal Authorities, with the consent of the Minister concerned:  (i) where the approved development or redevelopment can, under theexisting law or under the Bill now before Parliament or the correspondingScottish Bill, be carried out by the Authority;(ii) where large scale redevelopment of severely war-damaged orobsolescent urban areas is required;(b) The purchase price to be paid on public acquisition of land will, fora period of five years, be fixed on the standard of value ruling on 31st March,1939-(c) A reserve power of public purchase will be provided for use whenthe landowner is unwilling to make land available for such development as is required in the interests of good planning and would not otherwise besecured (see para. 39 below).Universal requirement to obtain consent.(d) The development rights of a private owner will be subject to a statutory restriction so as to secure that, although they remain vested inhim, they cannot be exercised by him until approval of the proposeddevelopment or redevelopment has been obtained from the planning authority.Betterment Charge. .(e) Owners of land, whether developed or undeveloped, will for thefuture, whenever permission is granted to develop or redevelop for adifferent use be subject to a Betterment Charge at the rate of 80 per cent,of the increase in the value of the land due to the granting of the permission i.e. 80 per cent, of the difference between the value of theland with the benefit of the permission and its value if permission hadbeen refused. In those cases where refusal would have attracted compensa-tion, a suitable set-off for such compensation should be made from the betterment Charge.Compensation.(j) Owners of land, whether developed or undeveloped, which on 31stMarch, 1939, had some development value, will upon any future refusal of permission to develop or redevelop, be entitled (except. where under thepresent law either no compensation or- only restricted compensation wouldhave been payable) to be paid fair compensation in respect of the loss ofdevelopment value existing on 31st March, 1939, but will not be entitledto any compensation in respect of any further development value accruingafter the 31st March, 1939. Fair compensation will avoid any excess overtrue development value due to the element of &quot; floating value &quot;.      0(g) Owners of land, whether developed or undeveloped, which on the31st March, 1939, had no -development value, will not in the future receive any compensation upon refusal of permission to develop or redevelop.(h) The precise formula for. determining fair compensation will be settled after a period of 5 years. More information will then be available to assistthe Government in avoiding the payment of any excess over fair com-pensation due to the element of &quot; floating value.&quot;
Centralisation of Finance.(i) The payment of compensation and the collection of BettermentCharge will cease to be the responsibility of Local Planning Authoritiesand will be centralised in a Land Commission. This proposal has been framed on the assumption that the control of the use of land will be somanaged that over a reasonable period of years, and over the country as a whole, receipts of Betterment Charge will broadly balance the pay-mefits of fair compensation.17. The meaning of the term &quot; different use &quot; (see (e) in the preceding para-graph) will need to. be accurately defined in the legislation. The generalintention, however, is to levy the charge wherever the owner is permittedsubstantially to change the nature or scale of his use, so that the value of hisland is materially increased. Change from one form of agriculture to anotherwill not, for this purpose, be considered a change of use.*18. The Bill at present before Parliament deals with the more urgent matters that arise on (a) and (o) above. It confers extended powers of compulsory purchase of land to meet, in particular, the special needs of war-damaged areas; and for this purpose it provides a simplified process of acquisi-tion. Proposals for the more detailed application of the remainder of thescheme described in para. 16 (c) to (h) are set out below under five heads:_(i) Universal requirement to obtain consent;(ii) Betterment charge;(iii) Compensation;(iv) Centralisation of finance;(v) Reserve power of public acquisition.IV. DETAILS OF THE GOVERNMENTS GENERAL SCHEME.(i) Universal requirement to obtain consent.19. Planning is a continuous process. Land which to-day is used for agricul-ture may tomorrow be required for housing or industry. Urban congestionmust be relieved by the provision of open spaces. But the rate of change is relatively slow, and over by far the greater area of the country ownerswill be able to go on using their land just as they do now without interferenceof any sort, whether they be farmers, shopkeepers, industrialists, or theordinary owners of a house and garden.20. Where changes are needed or desired, however, it is important that theyshould take place in the right direction and at the right time. When theinitiative comes from owners themselves in the form of an application for permission to build, and when the proposed use of the land is consistent withthe wider planning requirements of the area, permission will be granted:otherwise permission will be refused.21. This proposal involves two important departures from that recommendedby the Uthwatt Committee. First, the Committee&apos;s recommendation was limited to undeveloped land outside town areas. The Governmenfs proposalextends to all land, wherever it may be, and whether built-on or unbuilt-on.Secondly, the Uthwatt Committee recommended that where consent for development had been given, the State should itself purchase the land and* The use of land, not previously so used, for the winning of minerals, whetherby surface or underground mining, would constitute a &quot; different use.&quot; Specialconsiderations, however, arise in this case, and the application to it of the generalscheme is still under examination.
lease it to the applicant. Although purchase will be necessary in some cases,the Governments proposal is that the control should be operated in themain through the granting of consents or licences to develop. Further, theGovernment take the view that the power of granting or refusing consents &apos;should rest generally as at present with the Local Authorities, subject to appropriate powers of control and direction on the part of the Ministers;detailed planning administration would thus remain a function of the LocalAuthorities.(ii) Betterment Charge.22. In considering the question of betterment, it is important to have inmind that increases in land value arise, for the most part, on account of achange in the use of land (e.g. from agricultural use to building use) andthat in future the land upon which such changes take place will be determinedby public policy which may often not coincide with the individual desiresof owners. Thus, it may be found &quot;necessary to restrict further developmentround some of the large towns by providing a &quot; green belt &quot; and preserving the land for agricultural use. In consequence, development may take placebeyond the green belt, and new townships may be established in areas hithertocompletely rural. The land so selected for development will command ahigher value solely by reason of the planned diversion of development fromthe restricted areas.23. In the view of the Government the greater part, at any rate, of these increases in value should accrue to the public purse. There are two reasonsfor this. In the first place it is intended that fair compensation shall be paid out of public funds to the owners for the loss of development value which hadattached to their land at the 31st March, 1939. Unless such shifted develop-ment value is collected, wherever it reappears, it will accrue to other owners to whom it does not in equity belong, whereas it ought to be available toreimburse the State for the expenditure incurred on compensation. In thesecond place, it would be clearly inequitable as between owners if some wereprevented from making a profit out of their land and others, merely because etheir land had been selected as the most appropriate for development, wereenabled to reap the benefit. It might indeed be argued that the whole ofthese increases in value ought fairly to be collected for public funds.24. But despite the wide and increasing range of public purposes for whichland is used, a large proportion of building development takes place throughthe initiative of individuals. There is much to be said for providing aneconomic incentive to the owners of land which has been approved for development either to develop it themselves or to sell to a developer desirous of doing so. It seems expedient, therefore, that some percentage of theincreased value should be left with the landowner in order to facilitate volun-tary agreements and to enable owners and developers to strike a reasonablebargain between themselves in cases where development is desirable. Bythese means frequent recourse to compulsory acquisition will be avoided.25. In view of these considerations the Government propose that wheneverpermission is granted to develop or redevelop for a different use, a Better-ment Charge shall be imposed at the rate of 80 per cent, of the differencebetween the value of the land with the benefit of the permissionand its value if permission had been refused. In those cases where refusalwould have attracted compensation for the loss of development value existingat 31st March, 1939, a suitable set-off should be made from the Charge. Theremaining 20 per cent, of the betterment will be left with owners in order tofacilitate voluntary agreements.
(iii) Compensation.26. The Government propose that the 31st March, 1939, should be taken as the starting point for the new arrangements. Their intention is that where land has &apos;been deprived of any development or redevelopmentvalue attaching to it at the 31st March,-1939, fair compensation should bepaid (except in cases where no compensation or only restricted compensation would have been payable under the existing Town and Country PlanningActs). Further they accept the principle that the compensation so paid shouldnot be swollen by the inclusion of any excess over true development valuedue to the element of &quot; float &quot;; for otherwise compensation would be paid for more than the real loss incurred.27. They are not, however, prepared to recommend to Parliament theimmediate assessment of compensation on a global estimate as proposed bythe Uthwatt Committee.   Inffact they doubt whether it is possible, with the limited information at present available, to make any reasonably accurate esti-mate of the extent to which the element of &quot; float &quot; enters into the marketassessment of the. development value of undeveloped land.28. The Uthwatt Committee expressed the view that the total of theindividual and separate valuations would be between two and three times as great as the development value of all undeveloped land if assessed for thewhole country as a single sum. They called attention, however, to theparticular case of land which is &quot; dead ripe &quot; for development, where the element of floating value hardly enters, and they suggested special treatment for such land. Similar problems, although in varying form and degree, arise indeveloped land.29. There is the further important consideration that in so far as a refusal of permission to develop in one place is matched by a grant of permissionin some other place, the payments received in betterment should, over areasonable period of years and over the country as a whole,&apos; provide a fundadequate to pay fair compensation. The processes of planning and develop-ment in all their aspects will, therefore, be so managed as ultimately to securesuch a balance. Accordingly in the administration of planning policy theremust be a suitable combination of local initiative and central control.30. It appears to the Government, therefore, that some period of time must elapse before they can be in a position to decide upon the right compensation to be paid. Accordingly they propose that no compensation shall be paidduring a period of five years following the enactment-of the new legislation,and that while the individual right to compensation (i.e., the question whether any particular piece of land did in fact possess accrued development or redevelopment value at 31st March, 1939) should be determined as soon aspossible after the coming into force of the Act, the level at which the amountof compensation is to be; assessed should not be determined until the end of thefive year period.31. It is proposed that in the meantime the following steps shall be takenin order that the &quot;fullest information may be available to the Government:  (i) Land will be divided into three broad categories:  [a) rural land which at 31st March, 1939, possessed substantially nodevelopment value.   This may be called &quot; green&quot; land;(6) all other unbuilt-on land.   This may be called &quot; white &quot; land;(c) built-on land.
OO&apos;(ii) In regard to &quot; green land &quot; the presumption will be that the landhad no development value. Provision will be made, however, for anyowner of land within this category to claim that his land did in fact possessdevelopment value at 31st March, 1939, and if this is found to be the case avaluation will be made.(hi) In regard to &quot; white &quot; land individual valuations will be made ofthe development value, if any, of all such land at 31st March, 1939, giving,with each valuation, such information as it may be practicable to giveregarding the period within which development was at that date likely totake place.(iv) Cases in which an enhanced value for redevelopment attached tobuilt-on land in respect of which a right to compensation would haveexisted under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, (or the correspond-ing Scottish Act) if permission to redevelop were refused, were compara-tively few in relation to the total number of developed properties.Accordingly valuations of the redevelopment value, if any, at 31st March,1939, will be made only when an owner of built-on land claims that his landdid in fact possess such value.32. An Expert Committee will be appointed before the end of the five year period, and will be asked to assemble and review the material on which to base recommendations to the Government for determining the right compensa-tion to be paid, and to make recommendations. In the main, two sets of consideration will come before the Committee. On the one hand, they will need to make an estimate of the development likely to take place within aforeseeable future and of the annual income in Betterment Charge that mightbe expected to accrue from it. In this task they will receive guidance fromthe actual development then occurring, and from the information that wouldbe put at their disposal as to the future programme of public and privatedevelopment and as to economic prospects in general. On the other hand,the Committee will receive all the valuations prepared by the Governmentvaluers in accordance with the preceding paragraph. They will be asked toexamine the possibility of classifying the individual valuations under appro-priate categories in the light of the information regarding likelihood of develop-ment recorded by the valuers; and of graduating the formula for compensationaccordingly, with particular reference to the question of &quot; dead ripe &quot; land.33. At the expiration of the period of five years after the passing of theAct, compensation in accordance with such formula as may be decided upon by the Government in the light of the recommendations of the Expert Com-mittee will be paid forthwith to any owners of &quot; green &quot; land who may have established a claim to such compensation; and thereafter no compensationwill be payable in respect of such land.34. In the case of all other land, compensation will not normally be paiduntil an application for permission to develop or redevelop has been made and refused. The effect of this might be to induce all owners, whether or not they really desired to develop or redevelop their land, to apply for permissionin order to obtain compensation for refusal. It is proposed, therefore, that compensation shall only be payable, if at all, where the applicant proves either that he is both able and willing to carry out the development for which he isasking permission, or that the action or proposals of the Planning Authorityprevent the development of his land.35. Many owners whose land possessed development or redevelopment valueat March, 1939, may, nevertheless, desire to preserve its existing use un-35045 A 3
changed. The Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, and the correspondingScottish Act already enable Authorities to enter into an agreement with ownersrestricting the use of their land. It is proposed to encourage this class ofagreement in the following way:(a) The owner will enter into an agreement with the Land Commission(see para. 38 below) not to make an application for permission for change of use, and, in return for a permanent restriction which he himself desires, to forgo his claim to compensation in respect of the development or redevelop-ment value which had accrued at 31st March, 1939.(b) The Planning Authority and the Minister will satisfy themselves that it is proper to approve of such an agreement for the land in question.(c) The agreement will only be terminated (except by mutual consent)if at some later date it should be decided (after consideration of any repre-sentations by the owner in the matter) that the acquisition of the land for public purposes is unavoidable.(if) In that event the price at which the land will be acquired will be,at the option of the owner, either (i) the then current price for its existing use, or (ii) its market - value as at 31st March, 1939. With this con-contingency in mind a valuation will have been made at the time of the making of the agreement and permanently recorded.(e) During the currency of the agreement, the value of the land for allrevenue purposes will of course be taken to be its current value for its exist-ing use.(iv) Centralisation of Finance.36. The land on which development is allowed in future, and to which newvalues will then attach, will be selected by a process of planning. In many areas, much new development will be required, with a consequent increasein land values. In some areas, schemes for the reconstruction and thinningout of towns will involve a diversion of development to other areas and a consequential displacement of land values. Elsewhere reservations for agri-cultural purposes will keep the land stabilised at agricultural value and newvalues will be prevented from attaching. These operations will not be governed by local boundaries. In some Local Authority areas there will bea. net reduction of values; in others there will be a net increase. Moreover,a substantial redistribution of values will result from national policies forthe balanced distribution of industry; reclamation of derelict land; preservation of fertile agricultural land; and the establishment of national parks. Shifts ofland value will take place within nation-wide limits.37. It is essential, therefore, if the scheme outlined above is to be estab-lished on a sound basis, that the finances of compensation and bettermentshould be centralised in a single authority. To leave them in local handswould operate unfairly as between the finances of different Local Authorities.They would be driven so to plan their areas as to retain within them themaximum amount of land value, or, at the least, enough to meet the liability for compensation. Many of the defects of the existing system, which theGovernments proposals are designed to remove, would tend to reappear in a somewhat different form.38. The Government therefore propose that there shall be established a central Land Commission, independent, so far as possible, in the administra-tive sphere, but responsible to Ministers, and through them to Parliament.This Commission would be charged with the functions of assessing and paying the compensation under the proposals set out above and of assessing and
collecting the Betterment Charge, and with such other functions, not beingfunctions relating to the formulation of planning policy, as might be assigned to it. By these means it will be possible to bring into a single account thepayment of compensation as a whole and the receipt of Betterment Chargeas a whole, thereby leaving the local Planning Authorities free to plan thedevelopment and redevelopment of their areas without being damnified byshift? cf value across local boundaries.fv) Reserve power of Public Acquisition.39. b planning system directed to the allocation of particular land for particular purposes must carry with it, as an essential corollary, a power of seeing that the land so selected is available for the appropriate purpose whenit is required. Where land is required for public purposes powers of com-pulsory purchase already exist, and in the Bill at present before parliament and in the corresponding Scottish Bill a wide extension is proposed to meet in particular the special case of Reconstruction Areas where the post-warneed will be urgent. In the more general case of private development, theproposed Betterment Charge is framed with a view to encouraging landownersand developers to come to terms, in order that land may be made availablefor necessary development, and the need for compulsory intervention by any authority thus avoided. But a reserve power of compulsory purchase isnecessary for use where a landowner is unwilling to make land available forsuch development as is found, after a public local enquiry, to be required inthe interests of good planning and would not otherwise be secured.V. CONCLUSION40. The Government believe that if the Town and Country Planning bill now before Parliament and the corresponding Scottish Bill became law andthe proposals outlined in this Paper met with general approval and were indue course embodied in legislation, a statutory basis would be created onwhich a fresh and promising approach could be made after the war towardssecuring the best use of the land of the country, both urban and rural. the achievement of that object would depend in part upon the individual owners,who would continue, subject to the consent of the Planning Authority, to beresponsible for the use to which their land was put; in part upon the local planning Authorities, whose responsibilities and opportunities would be greatlyincreased; and in part upon the Minister of Town and Country Planning andthe Secretary of State for Scotland, who would give, on behalf of the Govern-ment as a whole, that guidance and impetus to Local Authorities that canbe derived only from a knowledge of national needs. It is not proposedthat a single master plan should be devised by the Government and imposed on the country, nor that the existing pattern of land ownership or land use should be swept away. The Government believe that a national and positivepolicy for the right use of land can best be evolved by a continuous processof collaboration between local and central authorities and the individualcitizen. The Government invite Parliament to consider whether such collabora-tion cannot best be assured by proposals conforming with the general schemeset forth in this Paper.(33045)   Wt. 604 509   131, 130, 130, 132   6/44   D.L.
