I have reached the conclusion that it would be unwise to approach theUnited States or Soviet Governments on this difficult and delicate subject untilHis Majesty&apos;s Government have cleared their own minds on the problems of(1) how we would ourselves wish to deal with these criminals and (2) whatindividuals we have in mind.3. On the 13th March the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and theMinister of Aircraft Production were invited by the Cabinet to give furtherconsideration to a draft formula relating to the first of these problems. their proposal will be found as Annex No. 7 to the memorandum circulated to theCabinet by the Lord Chancellor as W.P. (44) 294.4. As regards the second of these problems, I have had lists prepared ofthe major German and Italian criminals. These lists are attached as Annex Iand Annex II to this paper.5. I have also considered the question of preparing a list of major Japanesecriminals. I am inclined to recommend, however, that the Japanese aspect bedealt with separately at a later date nearer to the unconditional surrender of japan. Not only shall we then be in a better position to know which Japanesethe United Nations will wish to punish. Even more important is the fact that,in present circumstances, we should clearly not be able to consult the SovietGovernment about the Japanese lists. I therefore think that we are likely tomake more speedy progress if we now confine ourselves to discussing the more urgent problem of the Germans and the Italians with the Soviet and UnitedStates Governments.6. I have also considered whether lists should be prepared of enemy satelliteleaders. I am at present disposed to advise against, this, on the ground that theresponsibility of the satellite leaders is scarcely in the same category as that ofthe leaders of the major Axis Powers.7. It may be useful if I set out the principles upon which the attachedGerman and Italian lists have been drawn up.  They are the following : (a) The,lists of German and Italian criminals should be short. The figureof 100 has been suggested as an outside limit for the German, italian and Japanese lists combined. Consideration of the German andItalian lists suggests that the total figure for these together may be well12398   [27664]B
under 50. With any increase of the lists above this figure it becomesincreasingly difficult to draw a dividing line and to justify theinclusion or omission of one criminal rather than another.(6) It is difficult to establish hard and fast criteria, which would providea rule of thumb for deter mining by reason of their deeds and functions which persons should and which should not be included in the list.Nevertheless, it will be essential for the United Nations to be ableto satisfy world Opinion that their choice is systematic and notarbitrary and that their action against the listed persons is justified on the highest moral and political grounds.(c) It is assumed that the list should be confined to persons who will not bebrought to trial f cr specific war crimes, but will be punished by some form of summary action based solely upon their identification. the list must therefore be confined to persons whose position or reputation-tion is such that public opinion will not object to their guilt being-taken for granted without being established by any form of legal proceedings.(d) It does not follow that individuals should necessarily be placed onthe list solely because they have held high posts of responsibility in connexion with the preparation or conduct of the war (forexample, on the General Staffs). They should rather be-chosenbecause they personify the worst and most extreme features ofNazism and Fascism.(e) In general, it will probably not be necessary to place upon the list thosewho have been associated primarily with atrocities and the execution. of oppressive enemy policy in particular occupied countries; such persons should, where possible, be left to be dealt with by theindividual country concerned on the basis of the general war criminalsprocedure envisaged in the Moscow Declaration.8.   I would offer the following explanatory comments on points arising outof the attached German list: (a) The name of Hess has been included, both because of his former positionand activities and because his omission would be likely to arouseunfavourable comment, particularly from the Soviet Government. Itshould, however, be borne in mind that the Soviet Government have in the past shown themselves suspicious of Hess&apos; present positionand at one stage suggested that he should immediately be brought totrial before an international tribunal. It is possible that when thegeneral question is raised with them they may revert to this proposal.If they do, I would propose to make it clear that, in our view, Hessshould not be punished in advance of the other criminals. Prematureaction might merely lead to reprisals against British prisoners ofwar in German hands.(&amp;) The only member of the German armed forces included in the Germanlist is Field-Marshal Keitel. The question whether, in accordancewith our expressed aim to extirpate Prussian militarism, professionalsoldiers should be classed among the major war criminals, is a difficult one. On the whole, however, I would recommend that the list should not be extended to include other names, even those suchas General Jodl, Admiral Donitz and General Milch, whose associa-tion with the Nazi regime and its policy has been notoriously close.Owing to the fact that he was appointed Defence Minister in theGerman Government in 1938 and has held the post throughout thewar, Field-Marshal Keitel is in a special position and must clearlyshare directly in the responsibility of the Nazi regime. But once the list is extended beyond him it becomes practically impossible to distinguish between general political responsibility and the responsi-bility of professionals who are merely carrying out the regime&apos;s orders.(c) After full consideration I have also decided not to include in the Germanlist any of the chief industrialists, though they undoubtedlycontributed largely to Germany&apos;s preparation and prosecution of thewar. Here again I have reached the conclusion that it is impossibleto draw any satisfactory dividing line such as would justify without question the inclusion of some and the omission of others.9. The fact that the Italian list is so short might be publicly explained as showing what feeble and ineffectual people the Italian Fascists, including many
of their leaders, are. A certain amount of public explanation will be necessaryeven as regard some of the names on the list. All the people named have, how-ever, long and bad records of continual anti-Allied Fascism, and, with theexception of Mussolini himself and one other, all of them voted against the motion in the Fascist Grand Council meeting in 1943 which led to Mussolini&apos;s resignationand/or have come out strongly for Mussolini since the armistice as well.10. I recommend that I be authorised to communicate the attached Germanand Italian Hats to the United States and Soviet Governments for their comments,with an explanation of the principles upon which they have been drawn up asset out in paragraph 7 above. It would be desirable that I should at the sametime be authorised to give them some indication of the manner in whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government propose that these major criminals should bedealt with.A.
