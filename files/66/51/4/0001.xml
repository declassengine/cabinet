(44) 304.7th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.SOVIET POLICY IN THE BALKANS.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN recent months I have become disturbed by developments which seem toindicate the Soviet Governments intention to acquire a dominating influence in the Balkans. I accordingly asked my Department to assemble for me theevidence in their possession of this Soviet intention, and the manner in whichthe Soviet Government appeared to be Carrying it out. I also asked them fortheir views as to whether Soviet policy in this direction should influence ourown policy and our military plans in the later phases of the war and if so in what manner.2. My Department accordingly prepared the attached note on the subject which I now circulate for the consideration of my colleagues in the WarCabinet.3. In reading it, we should of course guard ourselves against the assumptionthat it is inevitable that, in the Balkans, there should be a direct clash of interestsand sooner or later a conflict. If we make it clear that we think there is anirreconcilable clash of interests between the two Powers in the Balkans, theRussians, who hold so many cards there, will work on the same assumption.We should not hesitate to make our special interests in the Eastern mediterranean and therefore in Greece and Turkey, and indeed our interests elsewhere in the balkans, clear to the Russians : but in any steps we take to build up our influence,we must be most careful to avoid giving the impression of a direct challenge.A. E.Foreign Office, 7th June, 1944.ANNEX.In discussing Soviet policy in the Balkans a clear distinction should be madeat the outset between what is meant by &apos;&apos; the Communisation of the Balkans &apos;&apos; andthe spread of Russian influence in those countries. It is doubtful whether in actual fact there is any deliberate &apos;&apos; communising &apos;&apos; of the Balkans at the presentmoment. It is true that the leaders of the Partisans, E.A.M. and L.N.C.(Albania) are Communists, and as such spread their ideological theories in the districts under their control; but this is very different from a systematic attempt on the part of some central organisation to &quot; communise &quot; the whole peninsula.Nor can any accusation be levelled against the Russians of organising the spread of communism in the Balkans. The spread of Russian influences, however, is avery different thing, and one which concerns us much closer. The Russians are,generally speaking, out for a predominant position in South-East Europe, and, areusing the Communist-led movements in Yugoslavia, Albania and Greece as a means to an end, but not necessarily as an end in itself.   The Soviet Government&apos;s[27609]
support of the Communist elements in these countries is not so much based onideological grounds as on the fact that such elements are most responsive to theirown influence and are the most vigorous in resisting the Axis.2. Furthermore, if anyone is to blame for the present situation in which theCommunist-led movements are the most powerful elements in Yugoslavia and greece it is we ourselves. The Russians have merely sat back and watched usdoing their work for them. And it is only when we have shown signs of puttinga brake on these movements (such as our continued recognition of King Peterand Mihailovic, and more recently the strong line taken against E.A.M. and themutineers in the Greek forces) that they have come more into the open and shownwhere their interests lay.3. It must be remembered that in the days when the Yugoslav Partisans andE.A.M. first made their appearance the Foreign Office frequently drew attention tothe clash between our short- and long-term interests. It was clear that support forthe Yugoslav Partisans would give us the best military dividend, and that E.A.M.appeared to be the most promising resistance material in Greece. But it waspointed out that by supporting these movements we should inevitably produce thevery situation with which we are now faced. In Yugoslavia at least we have obtained a military dividend; but E.A.M. in Greece has given us nothing buttrouble and annoyance.4. As regards our own policy for the future of South-East Europe our onlyconstructive suggestion has been the formation of a confederation of these States.The Russians have made it clear, however, that they will have nothing to do withsuch a solution, basing their objection on the grounds that such a confederationwould constitute a cordon sanitaire against them.5. Russia&apos;s historical interest in the Balkans has always manifested itself in a determination that no other Great Power shall dominate them as this would constitute a strategical threat to Russia. For instance, throughout the latter partof the nineteenth century, when the Ottoman Empire was in dissolution, theprevious alliance between Russia and Austria-Hungary turned into open rivalryin which each Power aimed at obtaining control in the Balkans. In particular,Russia&apos;s scheme in 1878 for a &quot; big Bulgaria &quot; with access to the iEgean led toGreat Britain and Austria combining to checkmate Russia&apos;s extended influence in South-East Europe. Subsequent events, such as Austria-Hungary&apos;s annexa-tion of Bosnia and Herzogovina and the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, were all movesin the game in which Russia and the Central Powers were playing power politicsin the Balkans. Now that, under influence of victory, the Soviet Governmentare reviving Russians traditional policy, it is only natural that they should startagain to strive for a predominant influence in the Balkans &apos;and they are no doubtstill hoping to achieve it by the same means, i.e., by working for the formation of governments who will be subservient to Russia. What is different is that, whereas in the nineteenth century we had Austria-Hungary as an ally to counter theseRussian measures, there is no one on whom we can count to support us this time.6. The following, as far as we can judge, are the Soviet Government^desiderata in the various JbJalkan countries.7. In Roumania, after annexing the portions of territory that they desire,they will require a friendly Government over which they will have a considerable measure of control. Communism in Roumania is to all intents and purposes non-existent and anti-Russian feeling is predominant, but if the Roumanians refuse the present Soviet surrender terms, the result in the end will be harder terms forthem and they will have to produce a Government subservient to the SovietGovernment.8. In Yugoslavia, Tito, by his own efforts and our own support, will probablyemerge as the governing force whether or not as the result of civil war againstSerbia. The probability is that the Red Army will eventually gain contact withthe Partisans and this will ensure Tito&apos;s position.9. Soviet intentions towards Bulgaria are not clear; but no doubt they wish to establish a dominating moral position even if they do not want more than this, i.e., air base facilities. As in the case of Roumania, the Russians will expecta friendly Government over whom they would have, control,10. Albania is only of interest to the Russians in so far that through thelocal Albanian Communist resistance movement they can connect the ring betweenTito and E.A.M. in Greece.
11. As regards Greece the Russians at first showed little interest in events in that country. Then about two months ago they began coming out openlyin support of E.A.M. and being critical of our policy. This caused us some concern, not only on account of the short-term difficulties which open Russiansupport for E.A.M. would cause us in pur Greek policy, but also on account ofthe long-term danger of a linking up.of the pro-Russian movements in Yugoslavia,Albania and Greece. As a result of our approach to the Soviet Government,however, the latter have now agreed to let us take the lead in Greece, and wemay hope that they will not hinder us in any way or openly give their support to E.A.M. The situation has also been improved by the recent agreement reached at the Lebanon Conference, whereby the E.A.M. and the Communist party areto be absorbed into an all party Government and thus, it is hoped, renderedinnocuous, while at the same time a national Greek Army is.to be formed in Whichare to be embodied all resistance units, including E.L.A.S.-E.A.M.&apos;s militarycounterpart. But we should not be lulled into a state of false optimism by thesesatisfactory developments. The national army may not materialise, E.A.M. may break loose again and the Soviet Government may yet fish in troubled waters. Weshould therefore make the most of the present favourable atmosphere to organisesome counterweight to the force of attraction which, no matter what happens toE.A.M., Russia is still likely to exercise in post-war Greece.12. Apart from what has been done in the case of Greece, are there anygeneral measures which we could take to prevent the spread of Russian influence in the Balkans ? The following seem to be the alternative policies which it is opento us to adopt subject always to the caveat that we must not on present showingexaggerate the extent of the threat to our interests and ought not therefore to resort prematurely to measures which might precipitate a head-on conflict withthe Soviet Government: A. To drop our own support of the &quot; Communist &quot;-led movements in South-East Europe and build up the more moderate elements. The suggestion that weshould drop our support of Tito now or at any foreseeable future date is but ofthe question. In Albania, we could, it is true, drop support of the Communistmovement but again it is the only element of resistance which is causing anytrouble to the Germans in Albania. Nor as things now are can we contemplate any longer in Greece the boycotting of E.A.M. and E.L.A.S., for to do so inpresent circumstances would be to repudiate the agreement reached after so many efforts whereby E.A.M. and E.L.A.S, have been reconciled with the GreekGovernment, and would force them once more into opposition and isolationbefore the sincerity of their present submission had been put to the test.B. To aive hill suvwort ourselves to all the &quot; Communist &quot; elements in orderto influence them in our direction and take the wind out of the Russian.sails. This would mean withdrawal of our support of the Yugoslav and Greek Kingsand Governments. This might be- possible but extremely difficult in the caseof Yugoslavia but wholly distasteful in respect of Greece; The advantage ofgiving full support to Tito would be that we should be backing a probable winnerand make it less necessary for him to look to Russia for support. But the disadvantages are obvious. Nor would it be possible in-present circumstances to give exclusive support to E.A.M. now that the Greek Prime Minister has agreed to receive its representatives into the government and to incorporateE.L.A.S. in a National Army.C. To approach the Soviet Government with the idea of reaching a mutual agreement not to dabble in Balkan politics. Such a self-denying ordinance wouldnot be easy from our point of view as we ourselves are taking a pretty active partin Yugoslav and Greek internal politics and would be reluctant to give it up.Also we shall wish no doubt to have our say as regards Bulgaria when the time comes. As for the bargain we hope to strike with the Soviet Government wherebywe follow the Russian lead in Roumania and they follow ours in Greece, thisis only intended to apply to war conditions, and it is hardly likely that either of us will wish to continue it when it comes to the Peace Settlement and post-war period or to extend it to other Balkan countries in view of the importantinterests both of us will have in the shaping of the future of the Balkans as awhole.D. (i) To focus our influence in the Balkans by consolidating our positionin Greece and Turkey and to bring about and utilise Tur co-Greek friendship asa fundamental factor in South-East Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean; and(ii) while avoiding any direct challenge to Russian influence in Yugoslavia,
Albania, Roumania and Bulgaria, to avail ourselves of every opportunity in orderto spread British influence in these countries. -This latter process might fromtime to time mean a combination of A and B according to circumstances prevailing in these particular countries.13. Of these courses, D seems the only feasible one in present circumstances and those likely to prevail after the war. D (ii) would need careful handling,especially by P.W.E., in order to avoid an open contest with the Russians, andwould not produce immediate results, but in the long run it ought to be effectiveinasmuch as there are elements in all these countries which will be frightened ofRussian domination and anxious to reinsure with Great Britain. This, indeed,probably applies to General Tito himself. D (i), which involves building up an anglo-Greek-Turkish Association, raises more difficult issues of a directlypolitical character.14. Such an association might be regarded with suspicion by the SovietGovernment, though we should try to allay that and justify ourselves by invokingour own interests in the Eastern Mediterranean.15. As regards.Greece, we should have to set about now building up a regimewhich after the war would definitely look to Great Britain for support againstRussian influence. This ought not to be too difficult and, indeed, ought to be rendered easier if the new all-party National Government, which owes its existence largely to our efforts and encouragement, establishes itself so securelyas to be able to take over the administration of the country on the liberation of greece.16. As regards Turkey, we should have to abandon our present policy of trying to force Turkey into the war under the implied threat that, if she does not come in, we shall leave her &quot; to stew in her own juice &quot; after the war. Instead,we should have to acquiesce in her maintaining her neutrality during the war aslong as she wishes to do so if by this means she will be better able, on the with-drawal of the Germans from the Balkans, to play her part there in collaboration with Greece as an effective counter-weight to Russian influence and penetration.Although the Soviet Government now. take the line that they are not interestedin whether Turkey comes into the war or not, they have probably never liked theAnglo-Turkish alliance, and the present deadlock in our relations with Turkeysuits them very well. They cannot be expected to relish the prospect of a renewedAnglo-Turkish &quot;get together,&quot; more especially when they appreciated, as theysoon would, the policy behind it.17. A reorientation in the sense necessary to bring about an Anglo-Greek-Turkish association is therefore bound to involve us in various difficulties, but itseems to represent the only feasible and constructive method by which we can hope to counter the spread of Russian influence in the Balkans, if we really think itnecessary that we should take special measures to do so.A.
