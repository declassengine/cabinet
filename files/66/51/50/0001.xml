L.Great George Street, S.W. 1,27th June, 1944.&quot;OVERLORD&quot; SECURITY AND THE VISITORS&apos; BAN.Report by Sir Findlater Stewart.AT their meeting on the 13th June (W.M. (44) 77th Conclusions, Item 2) theWar Cabinet agreed in principle that the special &quot; Overlord&quot; securityrestrictions, including the visitors&apos; ban and the Irish travel ban, should beremoved at the end of June, subject to the retention of any particular restrictionif good cause was shown for this. I was invited to work out the detailed arrange-ments to give effect to this decision with the Departments concerned.Special considerations arise in the case of the visitors&apos; ban, which S.H.A.E.F,.wish to see extended beyond the end of June for vitally important operational reasons. I have discussed the arguments for and against it with the following-Departments :-Home Office. Ministry of Home Security.Scottish Office. Admiralty.Ministry of War Transport. Air Ministry.War Office. Security Service.S.H.A.E.F.S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s case for an extension of the visitors&apos; ban is that it will continueto provide valuable support to the cover plan. There is very good reason forthinking that this plan has up to the present proved remarkably successful, andhas, been largely instrumental in inducing the enemy not to move the bulk of hisstrategic reserves from their present locations. The most important element in the plan is the threat to the Pas de Calais area, maintained by a notionalarmy group in the South East; and S.H.A.E.F. has little hope of continuedsuccess in this respect if the visitors&apos; ban there is removed. . Similarly, theScottish ban adds very considerably the maintenance of a threat to Norway. Itmight be argued that the removal of the diplomatic ban on the 19th June hasalready given the enemy an indication that we intend to relax our security precautions. -But it is now clear that the restoration of diplomatic facilities hasnot,&apos; so far, seriously affected the success of the cover plan, and it is reasonable to suppose that no harm from this cause is now likely, but S.H.A.E.F. are firmlyof the opinion that if it were followed at the end of June by the very importantstep of lifting the visitors&apos; ban. we could no longer expect to deceive the enemy.[27717]
Many of the other special &quot; Overlord &quot; restrictions will, of course, be removedat the end of June; but, with the exception of the visitors&apos; ban and the suspension-of Service leave (on the subject of which I hope shortly to submit a report tothe Chiefs of Staff), they are relatively unimportant,, and it is hoped that theenemy will not attach much significance to their withdrawal even if they cometo his notice.S.H.A.E.F. would prefer that no change at all were made in the visitors&apos; banas it operates at present. They do, however, appreciate the anxiety of those departments who are responsible for civilian welfare in this country to relax therestrictions as soon as possible, and they would therefore be content if the banwere maintained in full effect within the area from the Wash to, and including,Southampton and in the Scottish area. Broadly speaking, this would mean thatthere would no longer be any restriction after the end of June on visits toCornwall, Devon and Dorset/ S.H.A.E.F. ask that the extension of the ban,except in the released areas, beyond the end of June should continue until theend of July, and suggest that the situation should be reviewed again on the1st August The areas from which the ban was removed would still remainRegulated Areas, and the Service Departments will still require restrictions atspecial places within these areas for operational reasons; there should, however,be no difficulty about this.It was at one time thought that, for transport reasons alone, any relaxationsof the visitors&apos; ban would be open to objection; since the ban was imposed,passenger services on the railways have been very drastically cut, and it was feltthat, if trains had to be restored in order to carry visitors to the released areas,there might be serious interference with operational traffic. The attitude of theMinistry, of War Transport is, however, that they cannot contest the removal ofthe visitors&apos; ban on transport grounds alone. They would not propose to put onany additional passenger trains, and travel to the released areas could only,therefore, be increased within the limits set by the existing services. there could therefore be no adverse effect on operational railway traffic, and the onlydisadvantage is that essential travellers might on occasion be crowded off trainsby holiday-makers. They propose that, in whatever announcement is made aboutthe relexation of the visitors&apos; ban, it should be stated quite categorically thatthere will be no increase in railway passenger services to the released areas.The attitude of the Home Office, the Ministry of Home Security and the- Scottish Office is that, if the Chiefs of Staff accept S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s argument forthe retention of the ban for operational cover purposes, they could not oppose its continuance. They are naturally anxious to see the ban lifted as soon as possiblein the interests of civilian welfare; and in this connection they feel that therelease of the area to the west of Southampton would be a valuable concession many people in London and the South-East must be suffering from the strain ofthe recent attacks by flying bombs, and it would be most useful if these people could be given an opportunity to take holidays in Cornwall, Devon and Dorset,a part of the country which has so far been immune from the attack. They reportthat the enforcement of the ban has not, in fact, placed any intolerable strain onthe police; for the most part the public have accepted it readily, and successfulprosecutions in a few cases have been sufficient to deter the less public-spiritedpart of the population.The Service Departments and the Security Service support S.H.A.E.F. intheir request for the extension of the ban. The War Office are responsible for theadministration of the restrictions, since the Protected Areas ii.e., the areas towhich the ban applies were defined by the Secretary of State for War in theexercise of his powers under Defence Regulation 13;&quot; they feel that they will beable to hold the position for another month, which is at the moment&apos; ail thatS.H.A.E.F. are asking, but that thereafter if the ban is still to continue they mayhave to modify the categories of persons at present exempt from it to give a&quot; littlemore latitude. *Since the problem of the visitors&apos; ban is intimately linked with operations inNormandy, I have thought it advisable to send a copy of this report to the Chiefsof Staff. My own view is that, especially since there is at present no strong pressure for the complete removal of the ban, these proposals for continuing it inthe more limited area suggested should be accepted.(Signed) S. F. STEWART.Home Defence Executive,Norfolk House, St. James&apos;s Square, S.W. 1,27th June, .1944.
