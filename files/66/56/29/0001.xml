THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYEENMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.The circulation of this&apos; &apos;paper&apos; has been strietly limited, it is issuedPUBLICITY FOR ARTIFICIAL HARBOURS.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.THE War Cabinet at their meeting* on the 16th. October, 1944, asked theChiefs of Staff to report on the previous history of the arrangements for thepublic announcement about artificial harbours and to make recommendations.The previous history is as follows : *2. On the 8th September we were informed that General Eisenhower hadenquired whether he might now release the full story, of the &apos;&apos; Mulberries &apos;&apos; and&quot; Gooseberries.&quot; It was decided to telegraph to Quebec to obtain the PrimeMinister&apos;s approval and also to ask General Eisenhower to arrange for his statement to be circulated to the Service Departments for their approval.3. The approval of the Prime Minister was obtained on the 10th september and General Eisenhower&apos;s Public Relations Division was informed. The view was at that time held that there was no necessity to consult the Combined Chiefsof Staff.4. On the 11th September, however, General Eisenhower telegraphed to the combined Chiefs of Staff raising this question of releasing the story of&quot;Mulberry&quot; to the press. It therefore became necessary to obtain coveringapproval from the Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee before the press releasewas allowed to take place.5. Sir Alan Brooke raised this question at the meeting of the combined chiefs of Staff in Quebec on the 15th September. Admiral King said that basefacilities in the Pacific were limited and it might well be that &quot; Mulberries &quot;would be required in that theatre, in which case it would be obviously disadvan-tageous if the Japanese were informed as -to their potentialities. The FirsTt sea lord agreed with Admiral King that, if there was any chance of using them inthe Pacific, nothing should be released to the press for the present. The combined chiefs of Staff therefore agreed that security implications affecting other theatresprecluded the release of information on &quot; Mulberries.&quot; This decision was endorsed at the 2nd Plenary Meeting at Quebec the following day, and general eisenhower was informed accordingly, a copy of the relevant telegram being sentto the Ministry of Information.6. On the 28th September a telegram was received from the Joint StaffMission in Washington reporting that the United States Chiefs of Staff now recommended that General Eisenhower should be authorised to release theinformation contained in the proposed press release after deleting all references to the dimensions of caissons, piers and causeways, and details of design and construction thereof. Admiral King telegraphed in a similar sense direct tothe Prime Minister.* W.M. (44) 137th Conclusions, Minute 6.[28431]TOP SECRET Copy No.   86W.P. (44) 579.20th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.
7. After consultation with the Prime Minister we endorsed the Americanrecommendation, and on- the 30th &quot;September&apos; General Eisenhower was authorised by. the Combined Chiefs of Staff to &quot; release the information contained in thepress release after deleting all references to the dimensions of caissons, piers andcauseways, and details of design and construction thereof.&quot;8. The text of the final press release, which had been prepared in close consultation with the Service Departments, was seen by the Admiralty and WarOffice and obtained the approval of. the Secretary of State for War.9. Oh the 11th October General Eisenhower telegraphed to the combined chiefs of Staff Committee requesting a more detailed definition of the restriction on publication of dimensions of piers, caissons, &amp;c, with the object of achievingefficient photographic and films censorship. It was pointed out that thepresent blanket restrictions would result in the prohibition of the publicationof all photographs and films since dimensions were assessable by comparisonwith the known dimensions of other objects appearing in the pictures. the combined Chiefs of Staff referred this question to the Navy Department in washington as they were mainly concerned.10. It is understood, however, that on Saturday, the 14th October,S.H.A.E.F. were led to believe that the story had broken, or was about to breakin America. S:H.A.E.F. therefore decided to release the statement without thephotos, and this was done rather in a hurry on Sunday evening, the15th October.11.. On the 19th October we endorsed a recommendation from the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staff that the photos should now be published under certain conditions and General Eisenhower is being informed that &quot; there is no objectionto the publication of photographs of artificial harbours provided that the picturesdo not reveal details of design and construction and do not furnish informationas to detailed dimensions.&quot; It is understood that the photographs are to be released on Sunday, the 22nd October.12. We suggest that when the photographs are released opportunity be takenby the Publicity Authorities* to take steps to correct any wrong impression that may have been created by the original press release.(Signed) C. PORTALANDREW CUNNINGHAMA. E. NYE. V.C.I.G.S.* Note.-The matter has been brought to the notice of the Ministry of Information, and itis understood that action to this end is being taken.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,20^A October, 1944.
