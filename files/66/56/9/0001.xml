(44) 559.7th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.SECURITY IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I feel bound to call the attention of my colleagues to the deterioration ofthe situation in Palestine.2. The Cabinet will remember that throughout the year there have beena series of &quot;terrorist attacks by Jews on British police in Palestine. Theyculminated in the attempt on the life of the High Commissioner on the 8th August.3. The attack on the High Commissioner was serious enough, but these and previous attacks have involved relatively small numbers. Last week, however,a simultaneous attack was made on four police stations by at least 150 men armed with bombs and automatics and carrying explosives. On the next day a seniorBritish police officer was assassinated in the streets of Jerusalem. The attackon the police stations had all the characteristics of a carefully planned military operation.4. There is now every evidence that the attacks are the work of a large and well-organised group, the Irgun Zvai Leumi (National Military Organisation),with a small extremist wing known as the Stern Group. Their combined numbersmay be of the order of 5-7,000. They have affiliations with the New zionist organisation or Revisionists.   They have no affiliations with the Jewish Agency.5. The police, with all possible support from the Army, are doing fine work,but the strain on them is heavy. The main burden inevitably falls on the Britishsection of the Force. The War Cabinet have agreed that their number shouldbe increased from 3,000 by the addition of a mobile force 2,000 strong.Unfortunately it has not yet been possible to recruit more than a third of thesemen. Recruits can only be obtained as volunteers from one of the fighting forces and I propose to discuss with the Service Ministers whether a fresh appeal for volunteers could not be made. It may be necessary to bring the question beforethe Cabinet shortly.6. Apart from those against whom criminal charges can be brought, thepolice have detained 288 Jewish men and 26 Jewish women &quot; suspected of actualparticipation in or encouragement of terrorism and political crime.&quot; They aredetained under Emergency Regulations corresponding to our 18b. There is nodoubt that they are all bad characters and a dozen are particularly dangerousmen. These 12 are in Acre Jail, the rest in a camp at Latrun between Jaffa andJerusalem.7. These detainees are a major preoccupation of the police, since there is always the chance of a concerted attack being made to release them. There is evidence that such an attack is intended and the G.O.C. and the police cannotpositively guarantee that it would fail. If it succeeded, the effect would bedeplorable.[28358]
8. For this reason the Acting High Commissioner and the G.O.C. think it essential that, the whole 300 should be removed from Palestine at Once. legal powers to do this already exist or could be obtained without difficulty if they areremoved to British or British-occupied territory. The C.-in-C, Middle East,strongly supports the proposal and is prepared to undertake the move as a military operation and to accept the future safe custody of those deported as a military commitment.9. Apart from relieving the police and military of a burden, and removing the possibility of a serious setback to Government, the deportation of these persons would provide striking evidence that Government are taking the situationseriously.10. The actual operation will be delicate and there is the possibility of trouble in the course of it. Nevertheless, I am confident that it should be carried out,though I think it may be found best not to deport the women. i do not anticipateserious objection by the Jewish Agency. Among the public in Palestine the effectcan only be good. I have discussed this proposal with Lord Gort, who entirelyapproves it.11. Accordingly I have authorised the Acting High Commissioner toproceed, and the C-in-C, Middle East, with the authority of the Secretary ofState for War, is considering whether he can find at least a temporary destinationwithin his area, e.g., in Cyrenaica or Eritrea. It may be necessary to send thedetainees on eventually to East Africa or elsewhere, but this would take a little time to arrange.  I should be glad of the covering approval of the War Cabinet.12. The seriousness of the situation emphasises the need for an early decision on Palestine policy. Though we should all prefer to postpone the intro-duction of any new policy until the end of the war with Germany, the situation may be such that earlier action becomes essential.O.
