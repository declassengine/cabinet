QCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE$TY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECOND SESSION OF THE COUNCIL OF THE UNITED NATIONSRELIEF AND REHABILITATION ADMINISTRATION.THE second session of the Council of the United - Nations Relief and rehabilitation Administration opened at Montreal on the 16th September andclosed ten days later. While no one could pretend that the proceedings of the session were spectacular or of major importance, certain quite far-reaching decisions were taken, and,, if the Cabinet agrees, I propose to arrange for thepublication of the Resolutions and Reports adopted by the Council as a white paper, as was done after the first session. Here I will only summarise the leadingfeatures of the Conference and call attention to the more important resolutions.Some more detailed comments are contained in the Annex.The Council met in an atmosphere quite different from that of the first session,and, as explained in the paper (W.P. (44) 466) which I submitted to the cabinet before leaving for Montreal, it had been expected that some of the european allies, impressed by the rapid progress of liberation and by the necessity of takingvery early action to provide civilian relief supplies, might prove very critical ofthe Administration^-activities, might ask awkward questions about the relief supplies which they hoped to obtain from the United States and the UnitedKingdom, or about the consumption standards in these two countries, and might even, in the case of one or two of the paying Allies, go the length of - suggesting that they would do better to withdraw from the United Nations Relief and rehabilitation Administration altogether.In the event, these anticipations proved unfounded. In the meetings theAllied countries proved singularly inarticulate and seemed content to leave mostof the running to ourselves and the Americans. Although it was obvious fromconversations in the corridors that several of the Allied representatives weresceptical of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s ability to do much for their countries, there was no public criticism of the Administration, nor was there much discussion, public orotherwise, of supply matters. This may have been due partly to the fact that theDirector-General, as the result of the representations made to him by Mr. DeanAcheson and myself during my earlier visit to Washington, did not, as had beenfeared, take the line that U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s financial resources were so limited as tomake it necessary for its activities to be severely restricted; partly to thereassuring effect of the reports made early in the session by representatives of the combined Civil Affairs Committee on the progress of preparations for civilianrelief in the military period, and by representatives of the Combined Boards onthe supply position in respect of the various different commodities; and partly to the fact that, in our speeches at the opening session, both Mr. Dean Achesonand I made it clear that our two Governments, while whole-heartedly supportingUN.R.RA., felt strongly that it was up to the Administration to bestir itself and show that it was capable of doing the job entrusted to it and of acting as. a living organisation and not simply as a piece of machinery. Equally well, thegeneral apathy of the proceedings may have been&quot; due to the fact that most countries were rather indifferently represented. Except for the United Statedrepresentative, Mr. Dean Acheson, and the Canadian Chairman of the Conference,Mr. Pearson, none of the delegates made much impression, nor showed any desireto take an unduly active part in the debates. -Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 589-\%th October, 1944.Copy No&apos;.WAR CABINET.-Memorandum by the Minister of State.12547   [28462]b
Perhaps the most controversial question before the Council was the proposal that U.N.R.R.A. should undertake a limited programme of relief in Italy. Itwill be remembered that, at the first session at Atlantic City, &quot;the European allies had reacted strongly against the suggestion that U.N.R.R.A. should concern itself in any way with enemy territory, but had finally agreed to its undertakingoperations in such territory, though only on the strict conditions (a) that theCouncil should decide in each case the precise nature and scope of operations tobe undertaken, and (p) that the whole cost of such operations should be borne bythe enemy country in question. When&apos;, therefore, it was decided, in accordancewith W.M. (44) 117th Conclusions, paragraph 3, to support the United Statesresolution inviting the Council to sanction. U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s operating in Italy, itwas realised that this might cause resentment and provoke opposition. In theevent, a Resolution was passed to the effect that U.N.R.R.A. should undertake the care and repatriation of displaced persons, the provision of medical andsanitary supplies, the care of and welfare services for children and mothers, witha limit of expenditure in foreign exchange of 50 million dollars. This will enableU.N.R.R.A to tackle the most urgent tasks in Italy and to gain valuable experienceof relief work in the field, without unduly depleting its resources or arousing the criticism that it is doing for ex-enemies what it has not been able to do forAllies.Though the Resolution was adopted without outward opposition, the policyof helping Italy in this manner was far from popular with most of the european allies, who were both unenthusiastic in regard to the Italians and concerned lest the supplies which they themselves hoped to obtain should be diminished.   Therewas in fact considerable underground feeling against the resolution.    the americans made matters worse by having lobbied too vigorously in favour oftheir Resolution before leaving Washington and by encouraging the latin american representatives to make a series of rather nauseating speeches about their sympathies for Italy.  The Americans made it too obvious that it was mainly for internal political reasons of their own that the United States were so anxiousto help&apos;the Italians and this was naturally resented by the European represen-tatives.   In these circumstances, although it was possible to secure the adoptionof the Italian Resolution with only one amendment to the effect that it was notto be regarded as constituting a precedent for other enemy countries, it would clearly, I think, have been impracticable at this session to have obtained approval for the extension of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s activities to other enemy territories, and inparticular to Austria, as was at one time tentatively suggested by the Czecho-slovak delegation.   It is clear, too, that any questions concerning the extensionof U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s activities to enemy countries will have to be carefully handledin the future.   Any suggestion that such an extension was being advocated bythe United States or the United Kingdom primarily for their own purposes might lead to serious difficulties.Apart from this special Italian Resolution, the United Kingdom Delegationtabled a general one regarding the operations to be undertaken by U.N.R.R.A.in enemy territory in respect of displaced persons and health. The Adrninistra-&apos;tion was authorised to undertake, without prior reference to the Council, the care and repatriation of displaced persons of Allied nationality and such healthmeasures as are necessary to ensure that control of epidemics. Such operations are to be financed as far as possible by local currency, any expenditure in foreign exchange being recoverable, if recovery proves possible, from the enemy country.In the preliminary discussions on this Resolution the United States -repre-sentatives produced an amendment designed to extend the scope of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;sdealings with displaced persons in enemy territory to Jews and other persons of enemy nationality, who had been removed from their homes because of theirrace, religion or activities in favour of the United Nations. We felt that this involved a new principle which ought to have been made the subject of a separateresolution, but in the end it was decided to embody the amendment in our Reso-lution. A separate Resolution was adopted at our instigation, authorisingU.N.-R.R.A. to look after similar categories of displaced persons found in alliedterritories.These and other measures necessary to deal with the vast numbers of people in Europe who have been forced, either by persecution or by the exigencies ofthe war, to leave their own homes, and whose repatriation will be one of thefirst and most important of the problems to be tackled when the fighting ceases,occupied much of the attention of the Council. This is indeed the sphere in whichperhaps U.N.R.R.A. has its greatest part to play.
In the sphere of international health measures the Council approved inprinciple of two draft Sanitary Conventions, which had been drawn up, with theadvice of an expert Commission in London, by the Health Sub-Committee ofthe. Committee of the Council for Europe. These Conventions will, it is hoped,be signed or acceded to by all the United Nations in the near future. they represent a very considerable advance in the quarantine regulations and precau-tions against the spread of infection, which are made necessary by the speed of modern sea and air travel.In the matter of relief supplies generally the Council adopted the recom-mendations of the European Committee and its Sub-Committees on the bases of requirements, allowing the Director-General a reasonable discretion to adjustand modify them as circumstances might demand. The embarrassing Russianproposal to haye a Resolution adopted which would give priority to the peopleof those occupied territories which had the most actively resisted the enemy was withdrawn after prolonged Anglo-American-Russian discussions, and a compromise-rmise agreed on in a form of resolution which successfully avoided the substitution of a new criterion of merit for that of need.Other Resolutions adopted by the Council, of less importance than those Ihave described, included an authorisation to the Central Committee to admitDenmark to membership of U.N.R.R.A. between sessions of the Council shouldcircumstances make this desirable, a resolution extending the benefits of theorganisation to the inhabitants of the islands of the Dodecanese, despite their technical enemy nationality, and the appointment of India as a member of theCommittee on Supplies.The proceedings of the Conference were not made easier by the attitude ofthe Russian representatives, who began by threatening to be obstructive and whothroughout were entirely non-committal. They objected, for example, to a tenta-tive suggestion by the Czechs that the possibility of U.N.R.R.A- undertakingrelief operations in Austria should be explored, supported the pretensions of thePolish National Committee vis-a-vis U.N.R.R.A- against those of the recognisedPolish Government, but declined to throw any light oh their own probabledemands and failed to clarify their own attitude towards relief for czechoslovakia and Poland. It is perhaps unlikely that we shall make any progress towardsunderstanding until the question of the real relief requirements of the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics and the extent to which it desires to avail itself ofthe assistance of U.N.R.R.A. have been discussed and settled.Apart from this, I feel that the Russian representatives might be induced totake up a much more friendly and co-operative attitude towards U.N.R.R.A. and ourselves if in future we could arrange to have preliminary discussions with them,as we have with the Americans, on subjects proposed for the agenda, andendeavoured to concert a common line with them on all important questions likelyto arise at the Conference.Valuable results were in my judgment achieved at the Conference, as muchperhaps in the private talks and social intercourse between delegations as in the formal proceedings. My chief misgivings as to the ability of U.N,R.R,A. to perform its tasks with success arise from doubt as to the ability of the Director-General himself, and the efficiency of his senior staff in Washington. The tendency to centralise policy there makes this a matter of primary importance. Thesolution, in my view, is to place inJJieJ! aslung^ officials offhs^ate^ability and I hope that I may count on the support of my colleagues tothis end. After all, we have a substantial financial stake in UN.R.RA-, and it isvery much in our interest to get some value for our money,The United Kingdom Delegation was successful in securing the adoption ofthe proposals in which it was chiefly interested, i.e., the authorisation of u.N.R.R.A. to look after displaced persons and health matters in enemy territory,the extension of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s activities to a limited extent in Italy, and theadoption of the draft Sanitary Conventions. I trust that the Cabinet will recordits approval of the attitude adopted and of the decisions taken.R. L.Foreign Office, 19th October, 1944.[28462]
ANNEX.THE following notes are intended to supplement the brief covering note tothis paper :i 11. Consumption Standards.In W.P. (44) 466, paragraph 5, I pointed out that some of the european allies might be led by the information contained in the report submitted to themby the Director-General on the comparative lack of success of the attempts by .N.R.R.A. to accumulate relief supplies in advance of liberation, to demand that the supplying countries should restrict their own standards of consumption in order to provide more for relief. I mentioned that we hoped that furtherinformation to be supplied to the Council on the measures taken to ensure theprovision of essential supplies during the military period of relief, and on theaction taken by the Combined Boards in response to relief demands, both for themilitary and post-military periods, might go some way towards explaining whyU.N.R.R.A. itself had not been able to secure impressive quantities of supplies inadvance of liberation, and thus to deflect any attack which might otherwisedevelop upon British and American standards of civil consumption. The WarCabinet authorised me, if necessary, to explain that the United Kingdom con-sumption standards could not be reduced, though we might be prepared not toraise that after the European armistice as far as we should otherwise have feltnecessary. In fact, the information provided by the statements by the MilitaryAuthorities and by the Combined Boards prevented any attack from the Alliesfrom developing. After the delivery of these statements there was, in fact, no discussion at all on the availability of supplies and shipping. It should be noted in this connexion that the Americans take a much more rosy view of the positionin regard to the availability of food supplies for relief purposes than we do.Shortly before the Council&apos;s session opened, Mr. Byrnes issued a statement tothe press in which he referred to the large quantities of food-stuffs which wouldbe available for relief purposes. In the course of a general speech to the CouncilMr. Acheson made the following remarks : &quot; In the reports which you heard yesterday the supplying authoritiesassumed the responsibility for furnishing the supplies and told us that,generally speaking, the supplies would be available. I ask you to let me read to you the first sentence of the summary of the report of the Combined food board : The Board has confidence that, given the necessary co-operationbetween Governments, the problem of meeting overall requirements of allied countries in Europe during 1945 can be met. It can be met, said the Boards,and the Boards say that you may count on their utmost co-operation and determination to see that it is met.&quot; The significance of that, I submit, is that the time has come forUN.R.R.A. to put to one side worry about availability of supplies.   Thatthat responsibility. If they fail, as they will not, we will know where theresponsibility lies. The task of U.N.R.R.A. now is to organise itself, toput in its demands for procurement, to prepare its people for distribution and transportation, and to get forward with action and not worry furtherabout the availability of supplies.&quot; That, gentlemen, I believe to have been a tremendous step. Perhapsit is the outstanding milestone which will mark this meeting of theconference.&quot;It may be that Mr. Acheson conveyed a false impression to the Allies inmaking such an optimistic statement. On the other hand it may be no baduhing that such a statement was made in public by a responsible member of theUnited States Administration, since, if a pinch does come,-it may be a usefulway to bring home to the Americans their responsibility in this matter.2. U.N.R.R.A. and Italy.The War Cabinet agreed (W.M. (44) 117th conclusions, item 3) that I shouldbe given discretion to support the American proposal that U.N.R.R.A. should undertake a limited programme in Italy in connexion with displaced persons,health and welfare, to cost not more than 50 million dollars. We were able,after discussion with the Americans, to get them to frame their resolution inis somebodyundertaken to meet
a manner which, while mentioning the services which the Italians were render-ino- to the cause of the United Nations, seemed least likely to incense thoseAllied Governments who had suffered most at the hands of the Italians. Inparticular, the payment provisions made it clear that Italian local currencyshould be used to finance the U.N.R.R.A. programme wherever possible and that,as regards sums which must be spent in foreign exchange, the Director-general should consult from time to time with a committee established under Resolu-tion 23 as to the ability of Italy to pay. These financial, terms were the same,as those adopted for the resolution dealing with displaced persons in enemy territory, and were drafted by the United Kingdom delegation with the idea that they should become the standard provisions governing any activities ofTJ.N.R.R-A. in enemy countries which may from time to time be decided upon.3. Greece and Yugoslavia.The Balkans seem to be the area in which U.N.R.R.A. is most likely tohave a really large task to perform. If we believe in the idea of relief being done by a United Nations body where the local governments cannot look after their own needs, we ought to make sure that the arrangements under whichTJ.N.R.R-A. will operate in the Balkans are those best calculated to allow itto operate successfully. I am not convinced that such is the case at present.We should also remember that the Greeks and Yugoslavs will have some grounds for grievance which they will make the most of, if, when U.N.R.R.A. is operating in Italy, its services to their own countries are not on a scale proportionate to their deserts. The difficulties with which U.N.R.R.A. is faced in the Balkansare considerable. There is division of responsibility and dispersal of the Balkanstaff between Cairo and Italy. The Greek Government is in Italy; the yugoslav Government in London, and the Balkan operations of U.N.R.R.A. are controlled not from London, but from Washington. This makes orderlyadministration difficult, and in these circumstances, which (except for the lastmentioned) are outside the control of U.N.R.R.A., we should be prepared tohelp the Administration to the full. Active steps are being taken, in co-operationwith the military authorities to remove as many administrative difficulties aspossible, in discharging its responsibilities with success.4. Supplies for Poland.The Polish-Russian position continually gave rise to difficulties during the session. Poland is, of course, a country in which U.N.R.R.A. might be expectedto play an important role, but for some time to come supplies and personnel are not likely to be able to arrive there without Russian assistance. The questionis further complicated by the existence of the Polish Committee of national liberation, which the Russians recognise as being in control of the areas theyhave liberated, and therefore as entitled to request and receive relief supplies.I have already told, in my telegrams 16, 17, 23, 28, 45, 46 and 60, Relief, fromMontreal, what happened in connexion with the request for supplies received during the course of the Session and I need not repeat myself here.This is clearly going to be a very sore subject until Polish-Russian relationsimprove. Its difficulties will be increased by the fact that Governor Lehmanhas neither appreciation of such political problems nor competent advisers.Nevertheless, whatever the merits of requests made for relief supplies in Polandnow, it is clear that the time is not far off when the need will be*critical andwhen the ability or inability of U.N.R.R.A. to operate effectively may mean thedifference between life and death for thousands, perhaps millions, of people.We cannot, therefore, afford to let the problem take care of itself.5. The Russians.Both for the reasons mentioned in84 above and on more general grounds,it is clear that U.N.R.R.A. cannot succeed without Soviet collaboration. TheSoviet power to obstruct business, if necessary on trifling excuse, was wellillustrated during the first half of the Montreal session. Whatever the role of u-N.R.R.A. as a machine for distributing supplies, its importance as the firstUnited Nations organisation in action cannot be doubted; if the Russians cannot he induced to play in this case it may have a most important bearing on other united Nations organisations of much greater significance for the future. Inave referred in my telegram No. 19, Relief, Saving, from Montreal to the difficult problem of the Soviet contention that relief should be distributed accordingto the degree of resistance rather than of need.   This need not be repeated
The Soviet attitude to U.N.R.R.A. is a matter on which patience and muchhard work will be required. There is no single solution. There are, however,two steps which might make all the difference to the general Soviet attitude onthese matters. It has been our habit to maintain close contact with the Americanson all U.N.R.R.A. business and, in particular, to concert with them immediately before sessions of the Council to reach agreement on our attitude towards the main questions likely to arise. On the next occasion we should, I think, be well advised to have a similar pre-Council talk with the Russians, even if this means going tothe lengths of a special visit to Moscow. . Apart from this I am confident that much of the Russians&apos; hesitation about U.N.R.R.A. derives from their uncertaintyon how their own relief requirements are going to be met. It is fairly clearthat Soviet requirements cannot be wholly satisfied through U.N.R.R.A., if indeed they can be met at all in this way. In any event I think we should make an effort to get this matter settled as soon as possible. It is obviously not an easy mattersince it involves financial and commercial as well as political considerations,:.&apos; Ihave no proposals to make at present on how it should be handled, but hoplej tomake some later. pg6. The Administration.In general it can be said that the Montreal session of the U.N.R.R.A. council was a success. Not only did U.N.R.R.A. survive what might have been a difficult,if not a fatal, meeting, but some useful business was settled. The session wasmarked by a desire to change from the discussion of paper plans to action. Thiswas the text from which Mr. Acheson and I preached whenever possible, and itwas echoed by many other speakers. Nevertheless we, and other members of theCouncil.also, were aware of the fact that the Administration, as at present staffed,is most unlikely to be able to achieve in action the duties laid upon it. The majortrouble is the unsuitability of the Director-General for the position to which hehas been appointed. We ourselves cannot, however, escape all blame. We havenot contributed many competent people so far to the organisation to enable it todischarge the heavy task it is called upon to perform. I hope this situation can be remedied.In speaking of the proposal that U.N.R.R.A. should undertake certainfunctions in Italy, I made the point that this provided a valuable opportunity forU.N.R.R.A. to acquire experience in the field and to test its organisation in action.This is of course true, but if the first test is not met in a fashion which gives somepromise of adequacy later it may prove to be the last. It is significant that,although U.N.R.R.A. activities in Italy had been talked about for three months before the Council acted, no steps were taken by the Director-General to collecta team of people to carry out the work. If anything is to happen at all we shall,I am sure, have to make some contribution ourselves.7. The United Kingdom Delegation.The United Kingdom delegation was a large and an able one. If I mentioned the names of those who made the most valuable contributions I should not know where to stop. I am sure that the policy of providing the best team we can for meetings of this sort yields handsome dividends. On this occasion there were serious risks of the discussion turning in directions which might have gravelyaffected our interests. In practice the precautions we took prevented&apos; these developments. In choosing our representation it was, of course, necessary toprepare for the worst. It happened, therefore, that we included among our representatives one or two experts on supply matters who were not, in fact,called upon to take a very active part in the proceedings. Their presence was apiece of insurance which was wise in the circumstances.   1Finally, I should like to mention the debt we owe to Aluminium, Limited,for their courtesy and generosity in putting at the disposal of the delegation amagnificent suite of offices. Without these the delegation would have been seriously handicapped. -      -
