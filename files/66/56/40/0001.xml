[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET, Copy No,W.P. (44) 590. &apos;.25th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.VOTING ARRANGEMENTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE FORCES.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.1. The Speaker&apos;s Conference in their final Report, while recognising thatthe matter was outside their terms of reference, indicated that they attached great importance to effective arrangements being made for the exercise of theService vote and in this connection suggested, without calling for any evidence from the Departments concerned, that the Government should consider (a) postalor persons^ voting for Service men and women overseas, and (b) automaticregistration.  The following are the main features of these three systems : Voting in the field.2. This method of voting has since the beginning of the war been operatedat various times by Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Allsystems of voting in the field have certain common features.(i) Such arrangements are incompatible with any arrangement for previousregistration, as this would require that every forces&apos; polling stations should be supplied with copies of the register for the entire country,(iij It is necessary that there should be a substantial interval betweennomination day and polling day. This interval is required both toenable the names of candidates to be supplied to the polling stations and also to ensure that the poll, while being open for a sufficient number of days to allow a reasonable opportunity for voting to ailpersonnel in the area it covers, shall close on the same day as the pollin the home country. Even then, owing to the time required incollecting and counting the votes of members of the forces, there must inevitably be some delay in the declaration of the result.(iii) Since no register is used there is ah inherent difficulty, in those caseswhere a voter does not know the constituency, in identifying the constituency containing the address in respect of which a person is entitled to vote. It is understood that in the Australian election thispoint was met by the issue to polling stations of an ialphabeticalgazetteer of polling places specifying the constituencies in whichthey were situated. This is indeed the only possible procedure, but the compilation of this gazetteer and its consultation by the subaltern incharge of a polling station would be formidable tasks.(iv) It is not practicable to apply any system of voting ih the field tobye-elections. This is because since persons qualified to vote iii airyparticular constituency might be distributed throughout the forces,it would be necessary to operate the voting arrangements as universallyfor a bye-election as -for a general election,(v) It is necessary for the Service authorities to initiate these votingarrangements, to supervise their operation, and, after the poll andprior to the counting of the votes at the various polling centres, tosort the ballot envelopes according to constituencies &quot;[28463]
3.   It is doubtful whether, for the following reasons, any system of voting in the field would be practicable, or desirable, in so far as an election for theUnited Kingdom is concerned: *   (a) So far from there being no Service register, some Members are pressing ,for the publication of Service electors&apos; lists as soon as an election.isinitiated.  Presumably these lists are required in order that candidatesmay communicate with electors. . , .(6) The present&quot; interval between nomination and the poll is some eight days.An extension of this period is inevitable if voting in the field is to be operated, but if this period were to be extended by legislation it would still further increase the period which under the new arrangements would elapse between the issue of the writ and the poll (at present this is 1\ weeks).(c) If the forces are to be allowed to vote for the constituency containing the address at which they previously resided, it must be assumed thatthe vast majority will not know the name of the constituencyconcerned, e.g., a man with a Birmingham address would not know inwhich division of Birmingham that address was situated. It follows,- therefore, that unless in practice the choice of a constituency is to beat large, an index to addresses according to constituencies will need to be compiled and available to the officer in charge of pollingarrangements at every polling station.The alternative solution would be to require registration officers to issue to each man placed on the Service Register a card certifying that he is a registeredelector for a particular constituency. It would, however, be impossible to ensurethe speedy transmission of such a card to the elector. If he received it he mightwell lose it. Nor would it be easy to keep the information on the card up to date,in the event of a change of address resulting in a change of constituency.(d), It would in any event appear doubtful whether the general feeling ofParliament would be in favour of a system which would not operate, for bye-elections.(e) The United Kingdom forces are far more numerous than any of theDominion forces and are also far more widely spread, while thenumber of seats to be filled is also greater. The operation of any system of voting in the field would therefore put a correspondinglyheavier burden on those required to operate it, both as regards the supervision of the voting arrangements and the sorting of the ballotenvelopes according to constituencies.(/) Voting in the field, in order that it may be intelligently operated, requires that electors should have the views of candidates or at the least astatement of the policy of the main political parties. It is clear thatin practice it would not be possible to distribute statements of theviews of all individual candidates (as this would mean all electionaddresses going to each polling, station) and it is doubtful whetherowing to the large numbers involved and the wide area over whichthey are spread a wholesale distribution of a general statement ofthe policy of each party would be complete. This latter course wouldrequire that each candidate should be labelled officially on the ballot paper with the name of a particular party. There is no precedent for ^ this procedure and, in any event, it would provide no sureindication of political ideas in the case of independent candidates&apos; . or those representing a little known political organisation.4. The possibility of operating an effective system of voting in the fieldcame within the terms of reference of the Departmental Committee which included. Members of Parliament and the four party agents, but the committee did not make any recommendation to this effect. The four party agents havealso been consulted by the Home Office on this suggestion by the Speaker&apos;conference and are agreed that the proposal is impracticable.Postal Voting.. 5. Postal voting is not feasible because such a system requires that eachregistration officer should post a ballot paper to each member of the forcesregistered for an address within the constituency concerned. On receipt the ballot paper is filled in and returned.   The time involved in posting papers to
places at a distance and awaiting their return would mean that a count wouldhave to be considerably delayed, failing a very much longer interval: betweennomination day and the poll. Furthermore, the posting of ballot papers to :members of the forces presumes that the registration officer is in possession ofthe addresses to which to send the ballot papers, or that the Service departments should themselves undertake the task of distribution.Automatic Registration: .   , .6. Automatic registration could be effected by registering members of theforces either for the constituencies containing the addresses of their next-of-kin,or for the constituencies containing the addresses at which they were residentimmediately prior to joining the forces. There are, however, difficulties in theway of registration for either of these two addresses.7. The address of the next-of-kin may not be in the United Kingdom, and hence registration for this address would automatically disfranchise persons whose next-of-kin are resident in, say, Eire, but who might expect to be working and residing in the United Kingdom if they were not in the forces. Registrationfor an address prior to call-up might well result in a person being registeredf or a constituency in which he has no conceivable interest, i.e., the constituencycontaining the address at which he resided in his last directed civilian job.There are also machinery difficulties in the way of using either of these addresses.It is understood that the War Office has lists of these addresses, though they havenot the knowledge required to allocate an address to the right constituency, atask which would in any event throw a very heavy burden on the various RecordOffices. Moreover, neither the Admiralty nor the Air Ministry keep their recordsin a form in which they could be used for this purpose.8. Automatic registration on either of the lines proposed above would not,under the existing law, ensure that a member of the forces could vote withoutany preliminary action on his part, if he were out of the country, and hence couldonly vote by proxy. It would be necessary for him to appoint a proxy, andthe Speakers Conference do not suggest that the appointment of a proxy shouldbe automatic. A system of automatic registration would thus create difficultieswhich would not be outweighed by its advantages.9. There are two fundamental objections both to voting in the field andto automatic registration. Firstly, the difficulty of making arrangements foridentifying a particular individual with a particular constituency, and, secondly,the difficulty of enabling a person, even if such identification were possible, to vote intelligently with a knowledge of the candidates standing for election inthe constituency concerned.10. In our view there is, therefore, a strong and conclusive answer to those members of Parliament who are urging us to alter the voting arrangements for members of the forces, and this opinion is shared by the three Service Ministers.We are fortified in this opinion by the fact that the Departmental Committee,which was called upon to consider the question of service voting within its termsof reference, did not recommend any of the procedures now suggested.It may be assumed that any further examination of this matter will notendorse the recommendations of the Conference, recommendations which, it shouldbe noted, were reached without any evidence being heard. In these circumstances it seems to us that it would be an unjustifiable waste of time to set up a Committeeto reconsider this matter&apos;, and we accordingly recommend that Parliament shouldbe informed of this decision in the terms of the attached draft statement. If,however, there.is subsequent evidence of a widespread Parliamentary demand that this matter should be further examined, it might, we suggest, be necessary to reconsider the setting up of a Committee in order to examine the matter further;m all likelihood the result would be to make it clear that the Speaker&apos;s Conference&apos;proposals on this matter are impracticable and unworkable.H. M.T. J.Whitehall, S. W. 1,25th October, 1944.
Draft Statement.&quot; The Government have had under consideration the suggestions made by the speakers Conference as to postal voting or elections in the field of Service voters,and also the proposal that the existing registration arrangements should be improved by the introduction of automatic registration. The Government attach the &quot;greatest importance to ensuring that the best possible arrangements for voting by members of the forces are made, but after careful examination they aresatisfied that in existing circumstances, and having regard to the size of the forcesinvolved, it would not be practicable to improve on the present arrangements,which conform to the unanimous recommendations of the Departmental Cbrri-mittee, which included representatives of all parties and experienced registration officers.&quot;
