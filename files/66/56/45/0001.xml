- - naval &quot;SITUATION.General Review.* 1. An Allied force has been landed in the Philippines covered by a U.S.task force. The Japanese Fleet attempted to oppose the landings and was engaged by the Allied Fleet and driven off with losses.  The engagement continues.H.M. ships and aircraft of the Eastern Fleet have attacked the NicobarIslands.Norwegian Waters.2. On the 18th aircraft from H.M.S. Implacable, with Bellona (cruiser)and eight destroyers, located and photographed the battleship Tirpitz at Tromsd.Heavy flak was encountered but there was no smoke screen. Bardufoss airfield and Sorreisen were attacked, and one aircraft was destroyed and two othersprobably destroyed.On the 14th, H.M. S/M Viking probably sank a 2,500-ton ship off Bodb.Baltic.3. It is reported that the capture of Tallinn was effected by land forcesassisted by assault parties from landing craft. All ships in the port werescuttled, or sunk by bombs from Russian naval aircraft; wrecks and magnetic mines block the harbour and render it useless. The islands in the Gulf of Rigawere taken after assault landings. Riga suffered so little damage as to suggestthat the enemy had not intended to relinquish it so soon. Russian submarineshave sunk 13 transports during recent patrols in the Baltic.Home Waters and North Atlantic.4. . * The gale continued over the Eastern Atlantic and the coasts of theBritish Isles, scattering convoys and causing delay and damage to shipping.Two more tank landing craft, making six in all, were lost out of nine in an outward-bound convoy in the S.W. Approaches. Twenty ships were damaged in one homebound Atlantic convoy. H.M.C.S. Skeena (destroyer) dragged heranchors and was driven ashore at Reykjavik on the 25th. H.M.S. Manners(frigate) and the Norwegian corvette Rose were in collision while escorting an outward-bound convoy in mid-Atlantic on the 26th.   Rose has sunk.5. H.M. destroyers Brissenden and Tanatside on the 25th intercepted and sank a small tanker and an escorting trawler south of St. Nazaire. Manyprisoners were taken.6. During the week ending the 24th the totals unloaded through British-controlled channel ports were some 15,000 troops, 6,850 vehicles, 51,500 tons ofsupplies and 17,000 tons of petrol. U.S. totals for the same period were 41,000troops, 5,650 vehicles, 149,500 tons of supplies and 60,500 tons of petrol.Royal Canadian Navy.7. H.M.S. Uganda (6-inch cruiser) has been transferred to the royal canadian Navy and was commissioned on the 21st as H.M.C.S. Uganda.Mediterranean.Gulf of Genoa.8. While escorting minesweepers off San Remo on the 20th the Frenchdestroyer Forbm, after being heavily shelled by shore batteries, silenced onebattery and hit an ammunition dump. Enemy positions were also shelled by theU.S.S. Eberle (destroyer).A driatic.9. At Dubrovnik harbour facilities were found to be very little damaged.On the 21st M.T..Bs. and M.G.Bs. sank two lighters and captured three off Zaraand took 95 prisoners. On the next day a landing craft found an abandonedcargo ship laden with stores and ammunition off Pelagosa Island.
JEgean.10. Carrier-borne aircraft operating in the Volo area, south of Salonika, onthe 15th and 17th destroyed motor transport, ammunition trucks, caiques andbarges; they also sank an ammunition ship and set a coaster on fire. On the 18ththey attacked a train near Volo, and on the 20th bombed Kos.&apos; Troops were landed on Lemnos by coastal craft on the 16th, and capturedthe town of Mudros the following day. The enemy withdrew in a Siebel ferry,an E-boat, and nine caiques, four of which were driven ashore and the othersbadly damaged. The Siebel ferry and the E-boat later returned to shell our positions before finally withdrawing.On the 18th H.M.S., A rgonaut - (cruiser) sank a tank-landing craft in theNorthern ^aegean. On the following day H.M. destroyers Termagant and Tuscandrove ashore and destroyed the ex-Italian torpedo boat Solferino west ofSkiathos Island. She is believed to have been the last remaining large enemyescort vessel in the iEgean.Greece.11. Harbour facilities at Piraeus are adequate in spite of demolitions, and power, light and water are available. Unloading was prevented by bad weather onthe 20th, but was resumed the next day. Patras, Preveza, and Kalamata havebeen opened for relief shipping.Bast Indies.12. During the 15th and again at night H.M. ships of the Eastern Fleet,Renown, Indomitable and Victorious, with Cumberland, Suffolk and Phoebe(cruisers) and nine destroyers, attacked the Nicobar Islands. simultaneously with bombardments of Car Nicobar, air strikes in which six ships were sunk,were carried out on Nancowry harbour and fires started among port installations.At least eight enemy aircraft were shot down by fighters :. four of our aircraft are missing.On the 12th H.M. S/M Strongbow probably sank an escorted 2,000-ton ship in the Strait of Malacca.Pacific.Philippines.13. On the 18th U.S. forces began the reconquest of the Philippines. TheJapanese Navy reacted strongly, and a series of engagements have taken place since the 23rd, in which the Japanese Fleet has suffered severe damage.14. In the first engagement a force of Japanese land-based aircraft attacked a U.S. task group and hit the U.S.- aircraft-carrier Princeton. A largenumber of enemy planes were shot down. The Japanese then sent a task forcethrough the Sibuyan Sea, which included three or four battleships, ten cruisers,and about 13 destroyers, and which was repeatedly attacked by U.S. naval aircraft. It is believed that all the battleships were hit with bombs and one mayhave been torpedoed : one cruiser was torpedoed. A second task force, consistingof two battleships, one cruiser and four destroyers, was sighted S.W. of NegrosIsland in the Sulu Sea making for Leyte. Both battleships were damaged by-bombs. &apos; -The Japanese also despatched a third force south from Formosa. this included at least three carriers, one of which was sunk by U.S. aircraft and thetwo others severely damaged.15. During the early hours of the 24th the Japanese Fleet in force carriedout a sortie through the Surigao Strait in the south and San Bornadino Strait inthe north and converged upon the U.S. forces in the Leyte Gulf. The 7th U.S.Fleet, with ships of the Australian Squadron, intercepted both attacks. Theenemy&apos;s southern force, comprising three battleships, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers, was completely routed, losing in this action at least one battle-ship of the Yamashiro class (14&quot;) and several cruisers and destroyers. Theremainder retreated westwards from the Surigao Strait under continued air attack by naval aircraft which inflicted additional lossess. In this engagementU.S. losses are reported to have been extremely light, one destroyer being damaged and several P.T. boats sunk or damaged.[28473] . b
The enemy&apos;s northern force, of four battleships, several cruisers and destroyers, gained contact with one of the U.S. carrier groups off the east coast ofSamar and attacked with gunfire, when naval aircraft drove off the attacking fleet and* forced it to retire to the northward. In this engagement the enemy lostseveral cruisers and destroyers, while three battleships, three cruisers, and otherdestroyers were badly damaged. The U.S. casualties were one escort carriersunk and several escort carriers and destroyers damaged.16. On the 26th it was announced that two Japanese carriers and fourcruisers had been sunk, with two battleships and one large carrier probably sunk,in the battles of the Philippines and the Sibuyan. Six battleships, three heavycruisers, and several destroyers were also severely damaged. Of the two carrierssunk one was large and the other light. Most of the Japanese losses occurred in the battle S.E. of Formosa.17. The landings on Leyte Island were accomplished in nearly 600 vessels of different types which were covered by the 7th U.S. Fleet, together with .M. Australian ships Shropshire and Australia (cruisers). This force movedout from its New Guinea base on the 13th and was joined on the 17th by the3rd U.S. Fleet. Australia had her bridge damaged on the 21st during an enemy air attack in the Leyte Gulf. Casualties are reported to be five officers killed(including the Captain) and 17 ratings : 10 officers and 44 ratings were wounded.No Japanese surface craft or U-boats interfered with the landings and theonly aircraft to appear was shot down after- dropping one bomb. The landingswere preceded by an intense bombardment of the beachheads by battleships andcruisers covered by carrier-borne aircraft.18. On the 17th, U.S. carrier-borne aircraft made an attack on Luzon,when two transports were sunk and five other ships set on fire. On the 18ththey attacked Panay and Cebu.On the 18th, a U.S. submarine attacked a convoy of ten large merchant ships with four escorts off Manila Bay and reported having accounted for the majorityof the cargo vessels.New Guinea.19. ELM. Australian ship Geelong (M/S-A/S) was sunk on the 18th in collision near Finschhaf en : there were no casualties.Anti-Submarine Operations.20. Three attacks were reported during the week, by a destroyer, a corvette,and by shore-based aircraft.   None of these attacks was considered promising.Enemy Intelligence.21. It is reported that 200 fishing boats had been sent to evacuate german troops from the Kirkenes area before its capture. Coasters had been requisitionedas troop transports, and tankers sent from Kristiansand (S) to remove petrol.These reports, and the removal of Tirpitz to Tromsd, are held to imply that theenemy intend to give up Norway north of that town.22. On the 25th photographic reconnaissance of Elbing showed three,possibly five, destroyer hulls on the slips. Five destroyers were fitting out. since August 12th one Elbing destroyer had left and one destroyer had been launched.U-boats.23. Several U-boats have been on passage north of Ireland (R)r one or twosouth of Ireland (R), and one making for the English-Channel. One was attacked in the St. Lawrence River.Enemy Attack on Shipping.24.   No attacks by U-boats or aircraft have been reported during the week.Two small ships were mined and sunk, one at Boulogne and the other, a Swissship, at Marseilles. The hull of the former prevents the use of four berths in.theBassin a Flot, and will have to be removed in sections.
Allied Minelaying.25. Mines have been laid by aircraft of Bomber Command in the Kattegat.In the Far East mines were laid off Southern Burma, Siam and Formosa.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.26. There have been no reports of minelaying in Home Waters : bad weatherhas interfered with sweeping.In the Channel four mines have been destroyed off Sangatte, five at Boulogne.Three mines were destroyed between Boulogne and Dieppe and eight off Havre.In the ./aegean 119 mines have been destroyed off Patras : up to the 22nd138 mines had been swept off piraeus.The mine totals are : 5,786 ground and 6,512 moored.Russian Intelligence.27. In June 1941 the Russian Northern Fleet was composed of five modernand three old destroyers and 24 submarines, of which two modern destroyers and11 submarines have been lost. Since then three destroyers and five submarines havebeen transferred from the Pacific Fleet and the battleship Archangelsk (ex-RoyalSovereign), the cruiser Murmansk (ex-US.S. Milwaukee), eight destroyers and four ex-British submarines, have been added from the R.N. and the U.S.N. base and repair facilities however remain in their pre-war state.In the Black Sea the port of Odessa is now clear of obstructions, the construc-tion of 740-ton submarines has begun at Nikolaev, and a number of small shipssunk between Kerch and Theodosia have been salvaged.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.  (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.28. The outstanding events of the week&apos;s fighting have been the surrender of the Aix-la-Chapelle garrison to U.S. forces and the successful developmentof the new thrust by British and Canadian troops north of Antwerp and westfrom the Nijmegen salient. South of the Scheldt estuary Canadian troops havesteadily reduced the enemy pocket of resistance.Southern Group of Armies.29. N.E. of Belfort forces have made little progress during the week;positions have been consolidated on the hill features east of the Moselotte and.enemy counter-attacks have been repulsed. Further north, however, in the sectoreast of Epinal U.S. troops have advanced six miles in a new attack launchedon the 21st in the vicinity of Bruyeres. East of Luneville we have continuedto exert pressure and have made limited advances.Central Group of Armies.30. No change has been reported between Nancy and Metz during the week.In the area of Aix-la-Chapelle heavy fighting has continued. U.S. troopsfollowing the encirclement of the city closed in from the north and south againstrepeated counter-attacks; the city was cleared slowly street by street and thegarrison finally surrendered at mid-day on the 21st. Mopping up was completed by the 22hd, but there is still fierce fighting north of the city.Northern Group of A armies.31. East of the Nijmegen salient the British advance towards the Meusecontinues to be slowed down by the marshy country, mines and adverse weatherOur troops have advanced three miles south of the Deurne-Venraij road where their main activity has been mopping up. In the north our patrols have been active but there have been no positional changes. On the west of the salientBritish troops launched an attack on the 22nd and have made good progress.[28473] b 2
Hertogenbosch and Boxtel have been occupied and the advance pressed forward to within one mile of Tilburg. North of Antwerp British and Canadian troops have successfully developed a thrust towards Roosendaal; the attack started onthe*20th and by the 22nd our forward elements had crossed the Dutch frontier andare now within three miles of the town. Determined resistance has been encountered in this area.Further west on the 24th Canadian troops attacked across the BevelandIsthmus and have advanced four miles. Conditions have been difficult and our troops have had to fight their way through floods sometimes waist high. In thefighting south of the Scheldt estuary British and Canadian&quot; troops have been steadily closing the pocket; advances have been made N.E. and east all along thefront. Breskens was occupied by Canadian troops on the 22nd after a 24-hourassault, and further south the town of Schoondijke is in our hands.Italy. (An outline map is included as an inset.)32. Good progress has been made by Eighth Army this week. On the20th Cesena was occupied by British troops, and the River Savio was reached by Dominion troops along its lower reaches. On the following day bridgeheadswere established over the River Savio to the north and south of Cesena. before our forward troops, across the Savio, could be reinforced, heavy rain began to fall and the river became flooded. Supply to our troops holding the bridge-heads was consequently made extremely difficult and it was not until the 23rdthat bridges could be built. On the 24th and 25th good progress was made and enemy opposition was noticeably weaker. Latest information shows that our forward troops along Highway 9 are within four miles of Forli.Further inland, Polish troops have experienced hard fighting in the areaS.E. of Rocca S. Casciano but have made satisfactory progress and have captureda number of important hill features.British troops under command of Fifth Army, who for some time had been unable to make any progress, found on the 23rd and 24th that the enemy had withdrawn slightly from along their front. Advances were made, averagingabout one mile in depth. On the 25th contact was regained with the enemy intheir fresh positions, hard fighting took place, and small advances were madein the face of greatly increased opposition. Enemy resistance remains verydetermined on the U.S. front and for every yard gained hard battles have tobe fought. Slight gains have been made over the mountainous country which lies between our forward troops and Highway 9. Along the front betweenVergato and the coast activity has been chiefly confined to vigorous patrolwork.Eastern European Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.33. During the past week the Russians in the Petsamo area have crossed the Norwegian frontier and captured Kirkenes. Salmijservi has been captured,and the Rovaniemi-Kirkenes road cut. In Central Finland the German with-drawal has reached a line running roughly east-west some 100 miles north ofRovaniemi.Central Sector.34. The Russians report that they have cleared the whole of the rightbank of the R. Niemen. In East Prussia the Russian offensive has achieved a penetration of up to 20 miles on a 70-mile front. The Germans claim some progress in counter-attacks. The Germans during the past week have launchedfurther counter-attacks against the Narew bridgehead (20 miles north ofWarsaw).North Balkans Sector.35. A new Russian attack through the Carpathians into the Czechoslovakprovince of Ruthenia combined with the Russian thrust northwards from De]and Debrecen (the latter captured on the 20th) has forced the Germans to makea hasty withdrawal from the Transylvanian Salient. The Russians have now taken Chust and Satul Mare and have cleared the whole of Transylvania.West of Szeged the Russians, after taking Subotica, pushed on to reach the danube some 80 miles south of Budapest.
Yugoslavia.36. Belgrade was finally captured on the 20th, after very heavy fighting in which the enemy lost some 17,000 casualties. Since then Russian and Partisanforces have made further advances west of the capital.Farther south, the Bulgarian advance toward Skoplje threatens the railway from Salonika to Kraljevo, which latter is being approached by Russian forces.Throughout the rest of the country, Partisan forces have continued to attack the enemy and to increase his movement difficulties. The port of Dubrovnik was captured on the 20th the Germans having started their evacuation therefromtwo or three days before.Greece.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)37. British light elements, following up the German withdrawal, havereached Larissa. Patrols have also been established on the island of Euboea andhave reconnoitred Skiathos, an island to the north of Euboea. In the florina area,British special patrols are harassing the German movement through the MonastirGap. In the Salonika area, the enemy is thinning out his forces on the RiverStruma, and has destroyed neighbouring aij^fields and scuttled ships at Salonikaitself.The situation in the liberated areas of Greece is reported as on the wholequiet.Burma.38. Since the capture of Tiddim on the 18th, Allied troops have advancedsome six miles S.E. down the road towards Fort White. In North Burma Britishtroops have captured Mohnyin and are continuing their advance down theMyitkyina-Mandalay railway corridor.China.39. Operations against Kweilin have come to a standstill for the timebeing, whilst the Japanese forces reorganise.Philippines.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)40. On the 18th, U.S. forces began their reconquest of the Philippines.Dinagat and Suluan Islands, in the Eastern Leyte Gulf, were taken without serious opposition. On the 20th landings were made on Leyte Island, in theareas of Tacloban, Dulag and Cabalian. Despite relatively stiff opposition U.S.landing casualties were light. Within 24 hours Tacloban, the capital of Leyte,and Tacloban airfield had been seized. Good progress has since been made.U.S. troops have advanced three miles north of Tacloban; and from the Dulagarea, to the outskirts of the village of San Pablo in the Leyte Valley.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.41. Flying bombs continued to be launched against this country. details are recorded under &quot; Enemy Activity and Home Security.&quot; On one nightfighters destroyed two He. Ill bomb-launching aircraft over the North Sea.Fighter Command flew 151 sorties against this activity.Home Waters.42. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 577 sorties, involving 5,416 flying-hours; two Mosquitoes are missing, and three enemy aircraft were destroyed.Enemy shipping was attacked on every opportunity. In most cases results were unobserved and no vessel is claimed as sunk; hits, however, were obtained on two merchant vessels (both of which were left on fire), two tankers andtwo tugs.Bomber Command aircraft laid 371 sea-mines.
Western Europe.43. Bad weather prevailed throughout the week, and greatly curtailedoperations;. all the heavy bombing attacks on Germany were made through cloud,arid on the 23rd S.H.A.E.F. (Air) was reduced to hying less than 100 sorties!It is noteworthy to record that, out of 3,495 bombers despatched by bomber command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Command during daylight on the 22nd and25th, only six are missing.During the seven days ended dusk on the 24th, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air),of which 67 are-missing, flew 6,588 sorties; 1,482 tons of bombs were dropped and 48 enemy aircraft were destroyed. Aircraft of Bomber Command and theU.S. VIII Commands flew 10,099 &quot;sorties during the week ended dawn on the26th; 22,286 tons of bombs were released; 72 Allied aircraft failed to return.Four enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat, and a further eight on the ground.Enemy activity was on a similar scale to that of recent weeks, thegreatest effort being some 150/200 sorties on two days of the week. bombing operations were limited to small-scale attacks in daylight by Me. 262 jet-propelledaircraft on tactical targets in the Nijmegen area; eight of our aircraft were damaged on the ground at Grave.Essen was the principal target of the week, receiving 4,522 tons on the night of the 23rd/24th and a further 3,234 tons on the afternoon of the 25th. On thelatter occasion a fortunate break in the clouds enabled some aircraft to bomb on ground markers for a brief period.Other rail and industrial centres in Western Germany to receive attentionwere Stuttgart (2,425 tons) and Nuremberg (900) by night and Mannheim(1,248), Ffamni and Mtinster (1,000 and 950 respectively in two attacks on each),Mainz (710) and Neuss (522) by day.Attacks on oil installations were delivered on Homberg (Meerbeck), uponwhich 965 tons were dropped, two refineries at Hamburg (1,656) and Gelsen-kirchen (220). The airfield and aircraft repair works at Neumiinster were bombed (525), as were also the A.F.V. and M.T. works (1,055 tons) at Mannheim,Brunswick, Hanover and near Mainz.All the above attacks were made&apos; through cloud and, owing to the weatherno accurate damage assessment has been possible.* No enemy fighter oppositionAvas encountered on any of the above raids.Fighter Command flew 813 sorties, the majority of which were on bomberescort; seven aircraft are missing and six enemy aircraft were destroyed.Harassing raids by 223 Mosquitoes included attacks on Berlin, Hanover,Wiesbaden and Hamburg.In the battle area, Lanoasters made two attacks (1,000 tons) on the coastaldefences at Flushing, one of which was carried out in clear weather resulting in accurate bombing. Medium bombers of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) flew 165 sortiesagainst bridges over the Maas and gun emplacements in the Scheldt pocket; noresults have been reported. Operations by fighters and fighter bombers in supportof Allied troops continued at every opportunity; only approximately 6,000offensive sorties during the week were, however, able to be made on the whole front. Comparatively strong enemy opposition was encountered by 838 U.S.aircraft whilst operating over the Rhine between Essen and Coblenz on the 20th,when 24 enemy aircraft were destroyed, five probably destroyed and 25 damagedfor the loss of 18 U.S. fighters. Other successful fighter combats took place onthe following day over the middle section of the Rhine when a score of 23 :. 2: 13was obtained for the loss of four. In the course of all these tactical operationsabout 50 locomotives, 300 units of rolling stock, 180 M.T. vehicles, and 7 tanks were destroyed whilst considerably larger numbers are reported to have been damaged; railway tracks are reported to have been cut in no less than 140 places.On the 24th, 465 Mustangs and Thunderbolts (10 missing) whilst operatingfurther East in the Hanover-Cassel area destroyed or damaged over 200 loco-motives, over 400 goods trucks and more than 100 M.T.A total of 1,088 sorties were flown by aircraft carrying supplies to thecontinent.Southern Europe.44. During the week ended the 24th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew a totalof 8,460 sorties, of which 2,313 were by heavy bombers (42 missing); 5,253 tonsof bombs were dropped. A total of 93 Allied aircraft is missing, and 11 enemy aircraft were destroyed.* Note. Appendix VII is accordingly not included in this issue
Although bad weather restricted operations to a considerable extent duringthe week, heavy bombers carried out a number of attacks on airfields, com-xnunications, industrial and oil targets in Italy, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia,Hungary, Austria and Germany. The Tactical Air Force continued to provideheavy support for land forces, and very effectively attacked road and rail communications.Italy.45. On the 20th, Liberators of the Strategic Air Force dropped 187 tonsof bombs on the Breda armament works and the Alfa-Romeo and Isotta-Fraschinifactories at Milan, causing severe damage to these targets. The railway line inthe Brenner area was attacked twice with fair results, as were bridges nearCasarsa (35 miles N.E. of Treviso); heavies dropped a total of 268 tons on thesetargets. The harbour and oil storage depot at Trieste were bombed by Liberatorswith results believed to be fair.The Tactical Air Force very successfully cut enemy road and rail communications, notably in the regions of Bologna and Parma. On the 20th,Mitchells and Marauders obtained hits on ten bridges in the Po Valley and ona stores depot at Imola. On two other occasions light and fighter-bombersdestroyed and damaged several bridges and cut the railway line in many placesnorth of and in the battle area between Bologna and Cesena. These aircraft atthe same time obtained hits on enemy gun positions and supply dumps, and destroyed many buildings.During the week over 150 locomotives, nearly 600 railway wagons and over.190 M.T. were destroyed or damaged.Yugoslavia, Albania and Hungary.46. The railway centre at Vinkovic (90 miles W.N.W. of Belgrade) sus-tained considerable damage when heavy bombers dropped 210 tons; large fires and explosions were observed. Another railway centre at Maribor (110 miles N.E.of Trieste) was attacked (162 tons), but owing to cloud results were unobserved.Aircraft of the Balkan Air Force attacked enemy transport, troop concentra-tions and shipping in Yugoslavia. A number of locomotives, rolling-stock and small shipping was destroyed and damaged, and on the 21st a very large explosionoccurred at Metkovic (20 miles S.S.W. of Mostar) when the town was attacked byVenturas. Nearly 50 M.T. were destroyed or damaged in the region of Prilep in north Albania (45 miles S. of Skolpje) when fighters attacked a convoy of 100&quot;vehicles.The Coastal Air Force carried out a number of operations against shipping in the North Adriatic and against M.T. in Albania. A number of small vessels and barges was sunk and set on fire, and M.T. destroyed and damaged.In Hungary, the airfield at Szombathely (65 miles S. of Vienna) was attacked on two occasions by strategic heavies and fighters, a total of 149 tons being dropped in good concentrations; the fighters, in the course of their attack, during which they also operated against Seregeyles airfield, destroyed 37 enemy aircraft on the ground and two in combat and damaged a further 17. The Liberators dropped 118 tonson the railway centre at Szombathely and 103 tons on that at Gyor, blocking allthrough tracks in both cases.Austria, Germany and Czechoslovakia.47. The oil storage plant at Regensburg was bombed effectively on two occasions when Fortresses and Liberators dropped a total of 267 tons; fires and much smoke were observed. Other attacks were made on the railway centre ofRosenheim (32 miles S.E. of Munich, 229 tons in two attacks), Innsbruck (83 tons),and Plauen (45 miles S.W. of Chemnitz, 87 tons). An engine factory at Augsburgreceived 163 tons, but results could not be assessed owing to cloud.The synthetic oil refinery at Brux (45 miles N.W. of Prague) was also bombedthrough cloud (310 tons), as were the Skoda works at Pilsen (323 tons).( Russia.48. The Russian Air Force has given heavy support to land forces duringthe week, on what is reported to be on an unprecedented scale. .The long-range bomber force operated on at least two nights, attackingrailway targets at Goldap, and Gumbinnen and shipping installations in theLatvian ports of Libau and Ventspils. .      -

It is estimated that some 37,000 tons of shipping were destroyed. These aircraft also attacked the Wuchow dock area where a steamerwas set on fire and left sinking.Thirty Super Fortresses attacked Formosa, dropping a total of 131 tonson Eimansho airfield (Tainan) and Takao Port; bombing was through cloud and results unobserved. Seven enemy aircraft were destroyed and eight others damaged during this attack, for the loss of one bomber.Liberators, escorted by Mustangs, attacked White Cloud airfield (Canton),where six enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The escorting Mustangssank a tanker off Hong Kong and destroyed four out of eight intercepting enemy aircraft. Later in the week this airfield was again attacked by fighters with good results.A Liberator, while attacking a naval force south of Swatow, probably sank an enemy cruiser and a destroyer.In South China fighter-bombers and fighters caused many fires whenoperating against villages in the Mangshih area.
