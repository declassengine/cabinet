The British members of the Combined Committee hope that theirAmerican colleagues will adopt the following main conclusions of policy, as being in accordance with the Quebec decisions :&quot; (i) Munitions should be made available on Lend-Lease during the first year of Stage II on a.scale sufficient not only to provide those categories of requirements which only the United States can produce in the time,but also to make possible the release of man-power from munitions production in the United Kingdom to the extent explained herein,(ii) In the sixth year of war the British civilian is entitled to such moderateeasements as are practicable without interfering with the prosecution of the war, both by some release of man-power in the United kingdom to increase production for civilian use, and also by a Lend-Leaseprogramme, especially for food, which will allow some raising of standards.(iii) There should no longer be any restrictions or avoidable handicaps onthe recovery of the British Export Trade so that the United Kingdommay begin to be more self-supporting in respect of overseas paymentsat the earliest possible date.The British members also hope to establish that(iv) It is in the mutual interest that the British reserve of gold and dollars,which is already dangerously inadequate, should not suffer by the endof 1945 any significant deterioration below its present level.2. For the sake of simplicity in presentation, our programmes are basedon the assumption that the first year of Stage II will be coterminous with the calendar year 1945. If the German war continues well into 1945, our munitionsrequirements for that year will be different from those herein presented. In this event there may also be some additions to the non-munitions programme. Never-theless, in any event, it would be convenient in our judgment to act on theassumption that the new arrangements (apart from specific war requirementsaffected by the above contingency) should be put into force as at the1st January, 1945.3.   A study of the following chapters and the annexes thereto will give some picture of the position of the United Kingdom after five years of war,and indicate the nature of our requirements during Stage II.   The British&apos; members of the Combined Committee are ready to expound in further detail[28444] B
the arguments by which these general conclusions can be justified, and to providethe American members with any further information they may require inaddition to what is contained in this paper. Meanwhile, a brief introductionmay be in place here.4. During the last five years the British people have thrown everythinginto the prosecution of the war regardless of the effect on the future of thecountry. The British people, with the Dominions, is alone amongst the united nations in having been in the front line from the first to the last day of theGerman war. It has expended itself in the effort, and unlike most others ofthe United&apos;Nations, it has endangered its actual means of livelihood in the transition period after the war. After the end of the German war the country must continue not only to fight the Japanese war for a period of uncertainduration, but besides that to face a heavy burden in occupying Europe, and inpolicing the wide areas in the Middle East. The other European nations,liberated countries, neutrals, and even enemies, will be at peace, and returning to the arts of peace, can restore their civilian life and their export trade in competition with ourselves. Even in the best circumstances and even after fiveyears of incessant fatigue ,and many severe discomforts and privations, it is certain that a number of restrictions on civilian life must, nevertheless, continue for a long time. The British Government feel, therefore, that it is essentialto allow some let-up for the civilian population, some relaxation of effort, some more variation in food, some additional supplies of clothing and household goods, and at least a beginning of rehousing and the repair of buildings.Some progress can be made in this direction by the release of man-power fromthe work of munitions to the replenishment of civilian supplies, and an importantimprovement in the variety of diet would follow from the acceptance of thefood programme on Lend-Lease proposed in Chapter 2.5. Since our population of 47 million people is congregated in a very smallterritory, about one-third of the size of Texas, we could not have developed outof our own resources the war effort which we have made in all quarters of theglobe. To make such an effort possible, it was, therefore, inevitable that weshould be forced to seek large assistance from abroad. That assistance hasbeen given through Lend-Lease from the United States to an amount of$22-^ billions, through Mutual Aid from Canada to an amount of $2-^ billions,through the disposal of British-owned overseas assets to the amount of$4 billions, and through credits advanced by neutrals and (mainly) by othermembers of the United Nations, to the amount of about $10 billions a grandtotal of $39 billions altogether up to August 1944.6. While this assistance has enabled the British people to concentrate on thewar their man- and woman-power and the whole of their efforts to an extentgreater than in the case of any of the other United Nations (no less than67-5 per cent, of the working population being engaged on Government workin 1944), it has greatly distorted our economy and faced us with problems the full seriousness of which is not generally understood. When normal lifeis renewed, the British people cannot feed and employ themselves without importsof at least the amount they secured before the war, at present prices, about$6 billions a year. These imports we were enabled to pay for in the pastthrough our exports, visible and invisible. During the war we have been ableto throw our export trade to the winds and to turn over the man-power normallythus engaged either into the Armed Forces or into the munitions factories,precisely because Lend-Lease and other assistance from abroad has been providingus with food and other means of life and production. It is just because so great a part of our contribution has taken the form of providing fighting menand the munitions of war over so long a period that we shall have exceptionaldifficulty in returning to the normal equilibrium of economic life. For while our need for imports on the pre-war scale has not decreased, our visible exports have sunk to less than 30 per cent, of what they were in 1938, and our income from invisible exports has been largely reduced through the loss of overseas assets and of shipping and in other ways. Thus we shall end the war with an immensegap between the volume of necessary imports and the means to pay for them.This is the outstanding problem facing the United Kingdom which will pressupon us with all its force at the end of the Japanese war.7. For this reason it is imperative that the United Kingdom should again be entirely free to begin the recovery of our export trade, which is for us a matter
of life and death. To reach equilibrium we shall need exports five time as great as the scale of our exports in 1944. How far and how fast this recovery can bemade is uncertain. It depends not only on our own efforts, but upon prosperityand stability in the rest of the world. What is vital at the moment is that a beginning should be made. One main objective, therefore, in the proposals madein this paper is to allow, first, the release of man-power sufficient to permit asubstantial recovery of production for export, and, second, the greatest possiblefreedom for British exporters to find a market for this production. The suppliesrequisite to help release the necessary man-power are discussed in Chapters 1and 2, supported by the calculations in Annex C. The question of maximumfreedom of the British export trade is examined in Chapter 5.8. The fourth purpose of the following proposals is to prevent any significantdeterioration in the British reserve of gold and dollars during 1945. A further large increase in overseas liabilities is inevitable. But it is not inevitable thatthe present volume of our reserves, which are not much above danger point, shouldbe depleted.9. During 1943 and 1944 our reserve position has been sensibly improvedthrough dollar receipts on account of the pay of American Forces in the UnitedKingdom and elsewhere in the Sterling Area. With the end of the German warand with the movement of the Pacific war further from the shores of Australia,this source of income will largely dry up. According to our latest estimates,our net reserves are likely to have reached their peak in the latest return whichwe have made to the United States Treasury, that is to say, at the end ofAugust 1944, when the net reserves of gold and dollars stood at $ 1,748 million.Experience shows that it is extremely difficult to forecast the state of our reservesmuch in advance of the facts; for this balancing figure represents the differencebetween two large items, namely, our outgoings and our incomings, so that smallproportionate changes in the two latter items may have a large proportionateeffect on the difference between them. The latest estimates from London, however,indicate that by the end of this year the net reserves will have fallen from$1,748 million to $1,485 million, largely as a result of the falling off of receipts from American troops previously based on the United Kingdom and in Australia.This adverse factor will be accentuated in the course of 1945 and the forecast of the reserves at the end of 1945, as shown in Annex A, is for a reduction tothe dangerously low level of $1,130 million; that is to say, a reduction of no less than $600 million from the last reported figure as at August 1944. This is little above the minimum level of $1 billion below which, as is indicated in annex A, we could not go except in circumstances of the gravest emergency.Meanwhile, our overseas liabilities will have been increased by (say) $3 billion,These figures are given under the reserve that they are partly based on what atthis date can only be conjectures which can easily be falsified by events, by thecourse of military dispositions in 1945 and by the measure of our success inrecovering our exports. Nevertheless,, the trend is clear, a,nd we regard it as essential that some means should be found to reverse this trend from which otherwise serious consequences may flow.10. The exiguous amount of our reserves and the changes they have under-gone, compared with the situation in the United States, is well illustrated inthe following table : U.S. Net      UK.

Chapter 1. Munitions.I. Basis of Calculation and Assumptions.1. Our total requirements of munitions for the Armed Forces of the BritishEmpire and Allied Fprces supplied by us for the first year of Stage II have been arrived at in relation to : (a) The tasks assigned to us at the Quebec conference and the planneddeployment of our forces against Japan.(b) The size of the Forces we must maintain in 1945 not only to prosecute thewar against Japan, but also to meet our other commitments,particularly Forces of Occupation and Overseas Garrisons.For example, the reserves of$ billion.1-6......      2-25......      1-1......        -8......        -9......        -75no important overseas liabilities against themcertain countries are believed to be as follows :-*RussiaFranceArgentinaBelgium ....       ...Netherlands      ...      ...      ...China     ...      ...      .;.      :..The gold reserves of Russia by the end of 1945 should very considerably exceed the figure reported above.11. If such a serious reserve position as is forecasted above is actuallyallowed to develop, the Government of the United Kingdom will be precluded on financial grounds from taking a share in many responsibilities for which it wouldbe to the mutual interest of the United States and the United Kingdom Govern-ments that they should be jointly responsible. Perhaps it is scarcely necessaryto enlarge on the consequences of the United Kingdom finding itself at the endof 1945 in&apos; such financial straits as those here indicated. The weakness of the reserves in relation to the liabilities, coupled with the prospect of at least threeyears during which there will be a large running deficit on current account,presents a problem of formidable dimensions which cannot easily be remedied.The dangers of the situation have been accumulating gradually, and, unless thereis a radical change in handling the position, such as the Quebec decisions contem-plate, much worse than inconvenience will ensue. We lay great stress, therefore,on some action on the lines of the proposals in Chapter 3 below.12. The aggregate of Lend-Lease aid under the headings dealt with in chapters 1, 2 and 4 below amounted, in 1944, on the basis of the acceptedprogrammes for that year, to about $10 billion. It is believed that the&apos; amountof aid asked for in these chapters under the programmes for 1945 will aggregateabout $6 billion, on a basis which, except in the case of oil, the figure for whichhas not been netted in 1944 in respect of oil received on Lend-Lease and subse-quently returned on Reciprocal Aid, is on a strictly comparative basis. Inrelation, however, to both these figures it should be explained that, as noted inparagraphs 7 and 8 of Chapter 1 and the first section of Chapter 4, there areadditional items which no doubt would be chargeable against the Lend-Leaseappropriation. These cannot be so large as to distort the general picture, but weare not in a position to estimate them accurately. The aggregate of $6 billionabove takes no account, moreover, of the proposals to be made in Chapter 3 below,to which, as has just been mentioned, we attach special importance.13. The programmes proposed in the following chapters set forth aparticular detailed pattern by which the estimated results can be reached. Whilethe pattern is the best which we have been able to devise, we recognise that incertain categories some agreed variation in detail may be both desirable and possible without impairing the over-all result.14. In conclusion, we ask that the objectives outlined herein should beagreed in principle and in terms of aggregate aid. If, in the event, the basicassumption that the first year of Stage II will begin on the 1st January, 1945, isfalsified, such adjustments as are then necessary in specified war requirementsmay be jointly discussed within the broad cover of this general agreement.
2. Our total requirements have also been based on the- following assumptions :  (a) That Stage II begins on the 1st January, 1945.(b) That we can count on receiving from the United States and othercountries any deficit there may be at end 1944 on supplies accepted for procurement for 1944 less, of course, any cancellations that may be notified meantime.(c) That the duration of Stage II will be 18 months.Note. Should the German war continue at a high level of intensity well into1945 then our requirements in 1945 will be different from those nowtabled for the first year of Stage II.3. In calculating what we need from the United States we have had regardto:-(a) Existing capacity, i.e., we have not. asked for items which the munitionsindustry in the United States is not already producing or is not laidout to produce.(b) The fact that many types we need are made only in the United States.(c) The probability that we shall not be able to obtain from Canada and therest of the Empire a larger proportion of our toted requirements in stage II than the current level of supplies from those countries bearsto our total supplies from all sources at the present time.(d) Stocks of equipment surviving at the end of 1944 (for this purpose the assumed end of the German war).(e) Our limited man-power resources in the United Kingdom (see Annex C).Note. No requirements have been included for items now procured on directLend-Lease by the Australian and New Zealand Governments, notablyAircraft, since these Forces operate in a sphere of United Statesstrategic responsibility.II. The Planned Munitions Production in the United Kingdom.4. Munitions production in the United Kingdom is limited by two factors first, capacity, and second, the shortage of man-power for our essential needs.As regards the first, we could not at this stage of the war, contemplateinstalling on any large scale new capacity to produce things which hitherto havenot been produced in the United Kingdom and for which capacity exists in theUnited States. Not only would it be wasteful to do so, but supplies from suchnew capacity could not possibly be available in time.As regards the second, Annex C gives the provisional distribution of our total available man-power in the first year of Stage II, on the assumptions, that we receive from the United States the supplies for which we now ask, and that thesupplies from Canada and the rest of the Empire are maintained in Stage II atroughly their existing proportion of our total supplies.5. The man-power in the munitions industries (iron and steel, engineering,chemical and shipbuilding) occupied on work for the three Supply departments, isthe best measure we have of our munitions effort.6. In paragraph 15 of Annex C, we show that the proportion of our totalmunitions needs which we are planning to produce in the United Kingdom in thefirst year of Stage II is some 66 per cent, of our 1944 level of munitions production.Annex C also shows how we arrive at this figure and demonstrate very clearlyhow comparatively little we shall be able, to do, consistently with this level ofmunitions production, to recover some of the ground we have lost in the spheres of export trade, civilian standard of living, housing, and industrial maintenance.Ill: The Scale of our Needs from the United States.V. The only basis upon which we can give a broad indication of the relativesize of the programme we are now submitting to the existing level of supplies ison a basis of value.  We have used the best information available to us of current
prices. On that basis the munitions requirements from the United States in thefirst year of Stage II, related to the supplies in 1944,. are as shown in thefollowing table : Billion Dollars.First Year of1944. Stage II.Navy............        -694 -416Ground Army*......       ...   , 2-304 -846Air ..........   -   ...      2-751 1-832Total t    .........      5-749 3-094100% 53-8%* We have included in these figures the estimated cost of the military requirementsprocured through F.E.A. aggregating -111 and -077 for 1944 and 1945 respectively. Thenon-munitions programmes are reduced accordingly.f We have not attempted to cover in these estimates either in 1944 or in the first year of stage II the cost of such services as ship repairs, delivery charges in the &quot;United States, costs of modification and training centres. The United States authorities would no doubt be able tomake the appropriate allowances for such services having regard to the size and nature of theprogramme.8. The above cover our known requirements of munitions. They do not, ofcourse, make any allowance for such share of new developments coming into pro-duction during 1945 as might properly be assigned to British Forces for operationslater in that year. Moreover, experience in the past has shown that some pro-vision is necessary to cover unforeseen contingencies and what are known as&quot; spot &quot; requirements. We ask that a suitable overall allowance (gay, 10 percent.) should be included under these latter headings.IV. Character of our Requirements from the United States.9. A large part of the requirements&apos;are for items which are made only in theUnited States and the balance are items which we cannot make in the UnitedKingdom, either because of lack of time in which to change existing capacity or because of the limitation of our man-power resources. So far as our knowledge ofUnited States capacity permits, we have avoided asking for any items orquantities, the supply of which would present insuperable difficulties. If, how-ever. upon examination, there appears to be a strong case for our making more ofcertain items in the United Kingdom in return for a corresponding increase in thesupplies of other items from the United States, we should be ready to consider how far it would be possible in the time available to vary our requirementsaccordingly.We have also endeavoured to restrict, as far as possible, the number of itemsfor which we ask from the United States. It is of the essence of our case that ifsupplies in one direction are curtailed, there should be corresponding increases inother directions if the total available is to be adequate to match our militaryobligations, having regard to the limitation of our man-power resources.V. The Overall Supply of our Needs in the First Year of Stage IIcompared with  1944.10. Although our requirements have not been framed primarily with a viewto maintaining existing proportions, approximate equity as between the 1944 andStage II level of supplies in the various countries from which our supplies are drawn, is a factor which probably ought not to be ignored. The following tableillustrates the position : Proportion of proportion of Supplies in FirstSupplies in 1944.      year of Stage II.Percentage.

VI.-Indication of Quantities of Individual Items.11.   In preceding paragraphs we have described in general terms the scale and Ciiaracbtsr lu uur uSeus.    xix oeuuiuiiS v in, liv. anu a, we Siiuw ullc lAjuaio jlvjj.each of the main groups of items, and, within these groups, details of all ofthe more important items. These statements contrast the specific quantitiesneeded from the United States for.the first year of Stage II with the agreed1944 level and they also show the dollar values used.12. The following are explanatory notes regarding our requirements in thethree main groups : Navy, Ground Army and Air.Navy (other than Fleet Air Arm included in Air Force Requirements).13. The Naval requirements (excluding Fleet Air Arm and cost of ShipRepairs) in the first year of Stage II are estimated to be of the order of1416 million compared with a level of supply during 1944 estimated at1694 million. The ships for which we ask are required for the Japanese war.Practically all the other items are required to complete, convert and outfit shipsintended for the Japanese war.The Admiralty maintain that, speaking generally, Naval requirementsfluctuate in the light of strategic or tactical changes to a greater degree than other munitions requirements. If, therefore, we can be assured that the navy department will take due note of Admiralty requirements when initiating orrevising production schedules, our Naval requirements might be regarded asoutside any arrangement of a protocol character such as is advocated inparagraph 16.Ground Army.14. The Ground Army requirements from the United States in the first year of Stage II are estimated at some $846 million compared with $2,304 millionprogrammed for the British in 1944. The vast majority of these requirements are now for items of United States type which cannot be produced in the UnitedKingdom; in formulating the programme, moreover, we have cut down thenumber of items from some 660 to rather less than 400. The programme whichwe are now presenting consists largely of jungle equipment, special vehicles(including amphibians), engineer stores, and weapons and ammunition, all ofwhich are needed for the war against Japan.Air.15. The air requirements comprise three elements aircraft for the R.A.F.,aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm, and a group including engines, bombs, radio and radar, and other components and equipment. We estimate the 1944 levelof supplies under these three heads at $2,751 million; the programme for thefirst year of Stage II for which we ask is estimated at $1,832 million. as already explained, these figures exclude aircraft and ancillary stores supplied to the Australian and New Zealand Air Forces. The requirements are primarilythose which we cannot produce at all or in sufficient quantities in the UnitedKingdom in time for operations against Japan. Without a flow from the UnitedStates of components and ancillary stores on the scale suggested it would beimpossible for us to maintain the parallel aircraft production proposed in theUnited Kingdom.In addition there are certain services and facilities, for example, the BritishFlying Training Schools, which have been provided in the past and which wewould wish to see continued.VII. General Considerations.16. It will be obvious that in the aggregate the Munitions requirementsof the United Nations in Stage II will be substantially less than could be provided from existing capacity. It is clearly desirable for production reasons and forthe planning, both in the United States and the United Kingdom, of the efficientutilisation of our man-power resources that the programmes as now agreed should be as firm and as definite as it is humanly possible to make them. Forthese reasons we submit that consideration should be given to the according ofa protocol validity to the level of supplies agreed, as the outcome of the present discussions. It will be clear that the requirements of some items are much morehable to variations in tactical and even strategic plans than others, but the bulk
of the requirements for the Army and the Royal Air Force and the aircraft forthe Fleet Air Arm might well be covered by firm assignments subject to variationonly in the event of some major and unforeseen change in the course of the war.We therefore propose that consideration should be given to this point and the items jointly agreed to be suitable for such treatment appropriately marked.17. In the Introduction and also in the note to paragraph 2 of this Chapterwe make the point that the requirements now presented assume the German war to end in 1944. If it did not, firstly, our requirements for 1945 would inevitably be increased; secondly, our requirements for the first year of Stage II would be modified, although we would not expect the change to be very substantial in total.The representatives of our Service and Supply Departments will,.of course,be discussing in the ordinary way the programmes for supply during thecontinuance of the German war if it is, in fact, protracted beyond the end of 1944.VIII.-Navy Requirements for First Year of Stage II.The following statement indicates the requirements of the British admiralty for deliveries in t-he first year of Stage II and compares them with the estimateddeliveries during 1944.N.B.

Chapter 2. -Non-munitions Requirements in 1945.I.- Basis of Calculation and Assumption.1.   Our estimates have been made on the basis that our aims during the first year of Stage II.are  .......(a) To carry out the tasks assigned to us at the Quebec Conference.(b) To tackle the task of rehousing and to satisfy minimum requirements for maintenance and re-equipment at home.(c) To start rebuilding our export trade.(d) So far as the home market is concerned, to begin to restore on a modest scale the supply of manufactured goods from the level of about 50 percent, of 1938, at which it now stands, to a level of perhaps 60 per cent.(e) To provide that degree of easement in the standard of rationing needed to enable the civilian population, after five years of war, efficientlyto carry out its part in advancing these ends.2. It has been assumed that the food, raw material and other non-munitionsneeds of the United Kingdom should continue to be met through Stage II, as hitherto, by Lend-Lease so far as they may be drawn from American sources,after due regard to stocks and what may be obtainable from the British Empireand other sources. It is our view that these supplies are no less part of the war effort than the military supplies already discussed. Indeed, oil and shipping are largely used directly in the war effort. Civilian mouths have to be fed and the economy has to be kept going. If we drew our meat and dairy products to themaximum from Australia and New Zealand, bought all our oil from british sources in the Middle East and elsewhere, and turned our own shipping on tosupplying ourselves as its first task, the Allied war effort in the Ear East wouldbe seriously impeded. In fact, Australian and New Zealand foodstuffs go tosupply troops in the Far East, as does oil from the Middle East and much ofour shipping. As a corollary we have to make good our requirements from the&apos;Western Hemisphere.3. In preparing our programme of non-munitions requirements under thefive heads below, regard has been had to the desirability of eliminating any items of particular difficulty from an export standpoint.We have therefore decided to exclude &apos;- (i) All metals, minerals and chemicals (except certain items for specialisedmilitary end use which are now shown in the military programme,Chapter 1.).(ii) All manufactured articles for civilian use with the exception of opencast mining machinery and agricultural machinery and accessories.We have assumed that Stage II will begin on the 1st January, 1945.Summary of non-Munition Requirements in Stage II.Appropriation Estimated AmountProgramme First year of1944-45.

As it hasrecently been decided to omit from Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid respectively oil of UnitedStates origin retransferred to the United States Forces (in the United Kingdom) the estimate for Stage II is made on a net basis.   The comparative gross figure for Stage II would be -70.f $4,343 billion less an amount representing Dominion and Indian estimates and UnitedKingdom items not now covered under the heading of non-munitions for Stage II.

Food, &amp;c.In Annex B on civilian living standards in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in this paper, strong reasons are given, which we hope will be foundconvincing, why some easement should be allowed to .the civilian population ofthe United Kingdom when the German war is over. There is no intention whilethe war against Germany lasts to increase rations of meat, bacon and otherstaples, except for possible temporary modifications. But the Ministry of Foodhopes by Lend-Lease supplies from the United States in accordance with theprogramme set forth in detail below and by supplies from other sources, togetherwith the use of certain stocks already in Great Britain, which it might be possibleto reduce to a lower level after the defeat of Germany, to be able to raise Britishconsumption to something nearer the pre-war level. It is estimated that forthe most important commodities involved stocks might be drawn on to the extentof 250,000 tons of sugar, 105,000 tons of fats, 92,000 tons of corned beef, and115,000 tons of carcase meat. If these withdrawals from stocks and supplies from other sources can be supplemented by the programme of Lend-Lease supplies from the United States set forth below, there will be a reasonable prospect ofthe target aimed at by the Ministry of Food being reached. The actual achieve-ment of these increases of consumption, assuming the acceptance of our proposedLend-Lease programme, would, of course, still be conditioned by shippingconsiderations throughout the world and by the most urgent needs of liberatedEurope. In any case it is contemplated that rationing of the more important commodities will continue.The programme of Lend-Lease supplies called for by the above policy doesnot require a higher appropriation than that for the fifth Lend-Lease estimates.There are, however, important changes in the composition of the programme.In particular, there is a substantial reduction in the requests for dairy products and eggs, and also for canned meat. On the other hand, there is an increase inthe requirements of carcase meat. Particular importance is attached to the best possible effort being made to meet this requirement, since there is no item more essential (unless it be an increased ration of sugar) to improve the quality of the diet with which the British civilian has had to remain content for so long a time.We are very conscious that the proposal in respect of carcase meat will present difficulties, but we ask, nevertheless, that it may be sympathetically received.The food requirements for the first year of Stage II for the United Kingdom,British Services overseas, and certain British Colonies, are set out below.Requirements of Services overseas do not differ materially from the latest estimates for the fiscal year ending the 30th June, 1945. It should be noted that even substantial demobilisation in the second half of 1945 will not result in any considerable modification of stated requirements since the resultant diminutionin military consumption will be largely off-set by a greater civilian demand.The programme further assumes that no substantial new sources of supplybecome available to the United Kingdom during the year 1945 and that therequirements of United States Services of produce from the Southern Dominionswill remain as in 1944.We have not included in this programme any commodities which are not already supplied to us under Lend-Lease except flour. The Ministry of Food arenot asking on their own initiative for any extensions of the scope of foodcommodities to cover, for example, certain items, such as fresh and canned fruit,which were previously excluded from the Lend-Lease programme on the groundthat they must be regarded as semi-luxuries. If, however, in the changed circum-stances and having regard to the purpose of providing easement to the Britishcivilians wherever possible, the American Administration should feel able tooffer any such supplies, naturally thev would be extremely welcome to the Britishconsumer.

IIL^Oil.We have based our programme on the assumption that, as at present, the oil supplies available to the United Nations will be treated as a common pool tomeet essential requirements, and that the short haul-tanker principle will stillcontinue to operate. Broadly speaking, this entails the allocation of Middle Eastsupplies to cover requirements in Far Eastern theatres, so that for UnitedKingdom needs we must look largely to supplies from the Western Hemisphere.It should be noted, however, that there will be modifications for the programmeup or down, because the United Nations oil and tanker position is at present under its periodical review. This review will :very shortly be completed and necessary amendments to our figures will be made, promptly.In presenting our oil programme we have not taken into account theestimated requirements of the United States Forces in the United Kingdom andin other areas, such as the South-Eastern Asia theatre, to the extent that they arelikely to be supplied from United States sources. Supplies so made availablehave hitherto been included in our Lend-Lease appropriation figures, and havebeen treated as Reciprocal Aid when retransferred to United States Forces. Inour Stage II estimates, however (see table below), such oil has been treated as ifit had been consigned to the United States Forces direct through United Stateschannels. Thus against gross oil demands from United States sources of some1700 million, only approximately $475 million will be needed to meet british requirements, the balance being for the use of United States Forces. Moreover,we calculate that we shall be providing sterling oil from British sources underReciprocal Aid of approximately $100 million. In addition, there will beavailable a further $70 million of benzol and fuel oil from sterling sources, whichwill be provided on Reciprocal Aid if, as we expect, it is required by the UnitedStates. The above figures of Reciprocal Aid oil are, like those of Lend-Lease oil,on an f.o.b. basis, but in fact the delivery of Reciprocal Aid oil to United states forces, unlike Lend-Lease oil, involves substantial expenses in storage, handling,and packing charges which are not included in the above figures. The value ofour Reciprocal Aid is, therefore, in fact considerably larger than the figuresindicate.Our programme is based on the assumption that in the United Kingdomstrict rationing of civilian consumption is still in force in Stage II, but thatsome relaxation of the present severe restrictions may have to be introduced inorder, in particular, to relieve the heavy load on public transport and to facilitatemovement of* materials for certain special programmes, including housing.Oil.5th L/L.Appropriation.[These figures includedLend-Lease oil re-trans-ferred to U.S. Forces.]Aviation gasolineMotorKeroseneGas, Diesel Fuel Oil ...Crudes, Lubricating oils and othersTotalsTons 000.7,2586,0589534,5252,04220,836$000.422,234242,19721,08195,568175,204956,284Stage IIEstimates.[These figures do not includeoil from U.S. sources whichwill be re-transferred to U.S.Forces.]Tons 000.1,5005,0001,0002,5001,10011,100sooo.105,000210,00025,00050,00085,000475,000IV. Shipping.In making these estimates we have assumed that the general operatingpolicies now followed by the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board in the integration of British and United States control of merchant fleets will continuealong the same lines as at present. We have taken account, so far as we are ableto estimate them, of changes in shipping requirements arising upon the end of thewar in Europe and out of the Quebec decisions as to the war against Japan. Wehave then assumed that the existing principles of Lend-Lease eligibility continue
to apply. We have not taken into consideration the possible effects on ourestimates of certain proposals outlined in Chapter 3.We recognise that the end of the war in Europe will herald changes in theexisting control of shipping, and introduce a new co-ordinated control exercised by the United Maritime Executive Board. We have not attempted to guess whatalterations in our requirements might result from these changes in the machineryof shipping control, except that it has been assumed that dollar hire will not be payable on Dutch vessels under the memorandum of the 5th June, 1942 (itemNo. 5 in the shipping estimates).On this basis we arrive at an estimate of $990 million, covering tanker anddry cargo freights and other forms of shipping assistance. But this figure would,of course, be subject to modification in the event of modification of the shippingallocations, &amp;c, on which it is based.British Shipping Requirements in Shipping fnTinid States during Stage II.1.

We have, however, eliminated items which might give rise tocontroversy if used for this purpose or in the export trade. We have also hadin mind the reduction as much as possible of detailed administrative work bothin the United States and the United Kingdom. Iron and Steel, which hashitherto accounted for a large part of previous programmes, is entirely omitted from this non-miinitions programme as it is hoped that United kingdom production will meet requirements for some time ahead. Other metals andminerals, together with chemicals and a number of miscellaneous raw materials,have also been omitted. Our requirements of these items not on Lend-Lease inthe first year of Stage II will involve an expenditure in cash of about 40 million dollars.A small number of raw materials e.g., tropical packaging and nylon forparachutes -the total supplies of which from all sources are either used directly by the Armed Forces or solely for manufacture into stores for the Armed Forces,have been included in the military programme of requirements.   (Chapter 1.)After allowing for the changes mentioned above the total estimate of$222-25 million compares with the total estimate of $444-40 million submitted for the Fifth Lend-Lease appropriation. In addition, the United Kingdom willhope to obtain during 1945 28 million ozs. of silver, but as, under a special arrange-ment, this silver is returnable in kind, no estimate of value has been included.Raw Materials.United Kingdom Raw Materials Requirements from United States.Estimates for First year of Stage II.Quantity.

Chapter 3. Additional Items to Safeguard the British Reserve Position.1. The ^ro^ramme for non-munitions assistance from Lend-Lease set forth in the preceding chapter does not go outside the same general ground as thatwhich is covered by the fifth Lend-Lease Appropriation. It covers, in, fact,somewhat narrower ground, since a number of items, in the fields both of rawmaterials and of manufactured goods, have been excluded in case they might leadto export difficulties.2. Moreover, the field of the fifth Lend-Lease Appropriation had been itselfsomewhat narrowed by the exclusion of certain items which had been includedin some previous Appropriations and would, therefore, appear to be eligiblewithin the terms of the Lend-Lease Act. It is believed that this narrowing ofthe field was partly influenced by the fact that, at the time when these programmes were being compiled, the British gold and dollar reserves were steadily rising.It was also in the atmosphere of rising British reserves that the scope of reciprocal Aid was enlarged so as to cover not only the expenses of the UnitedStates Forces (apart from pay) in the Sterling Area, but also certain raw materials and foodstuffs.3. It has, however, been shown in the introduction, supported by further particulars in Annex A, that the cumulative effect of these measures, continuedinto a period when the earnings of the Sterling Area in respect of the pay ofthe American Forces are being steadily reduced, will be to cause the british treasury to incur gold said dollar outgoings considerably in excess of its receipts and thus to suffer by the end of 1945 a loss of what might amount to the greaterpart of the improvement in the balances which occurred between the summer of1943 and the summer of 1944. Yet during the period subsequent to the summer of 1943 the British overseas liabilities will have increased by several billions.4. If no mitigating measures are adopted, the British Treasury are likelyto enter Stage III with reserves of less than $I-5 billion, and perhaps not muchover $1 billion with liabilities approaching 15 billion, and with a running adverse balance on current account which can scarcely be put at less than 4 or 5 billionbefore equilibrium is reached. A comparison with the reserve position not merely of the United States itself, but also of Russia, France, Belgium, Holland, Chinaand Argentina, has been given in the Introduction.5. It is for the United States Administration to consider whether this isthe right and proper outcome of the sacrifices and efforts which have been made and whether it is consistent with the principle of pooling by which in manyfields our policies are now governed, greatly to the common advantage. It is also for consideration whether it would be convenient that one of the major allies should enter the period of pacification, resettlement and reconstruction, unable,merely on financial grounds, to take its natural part in the sharing of duties andtasks and responsibilities.6. The British Treasury has shown itself ready to take, deliberately, greatfinancial risks. Nor do they take a tragic view of the impending situation. Whatthey see in front of them is very far from disastrous. On the contrary, not onlyhas the unselfregarding use of their resources been an instrument of victoryemployed with full foreknowledge of the consequences, but they well know thatthe wealth.and prosperity of the country have very little to do with the reserves and other sequelae of the past which are a half-dead affair. In the long run and not in the very long run it is the national productivity, the national capacity and the national character which will matter. The financial situation, hereportrayed, should not, therefore, be regarded as more than an embarrassment.Bat it is, for the time being, a very great embarrassment and it is capable ofinterfering with post-war collaboration on the lines which on other groundswould be thought most mutually desirable, to an extent altogether out of proportion to the amount of money involved. Moreover, it is not a question ofcompletely removing the embarrassment, which we shall find some way of handlingin due course, but of sufficiently mitigating it to allow a little more elbow-roomm the near future during which fateful decisions will have to be taken.7. It is therefore suggested that, in the light of all these matters, some consideration should be given to the reinclusion in the programme of certain items which have been cut out at one time-or another; and also, perhaps, to certainoutstanding claims relating to past transactions which it was agreed to hold in abeyance at the time when the British balances were increasing.
8.   In the first category, the most important items are the following: (i) Tobacco, $90 million. On the Lend-Lease programme at one time, fromwhiah it was removed when our reserves were believed to be sufficient, but therestoration of which should not, it is believed, involve any particular difficulty.(ii) Off-shore Sugar, $90 million. On the Lend-Lease list at one time. Itis believed that Russia is still receiving off-shore sugar on Lend-Lease.Admittedly this item is not an easy one to handle, there being supply as wellas financial difficulties. On the other hand, it is one of the items involving asubstantial sum.(iii) Crude Oil Purchases for the Curasao and Bahrein Refineries. Theoperation of these refineries is so designed as to produce the maximum amountof critical oil products for the war effort, a large proportion of which is handedover to the United States Government on Reciprocal Aid. In order to implementthis programme it is necessary to purchase for dollars considerable quantities of crude oil from American companies in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Theseamounts are currently running at the rate of $16 million per annum and are estimated to increase in Stage II to $22 million per annum. It is therefore suggested that it will be appropriate to bring these outgoings within the ambitof Lend-Lease with effect from the date in 1944 from which oil from the aboverefineries was made available to the United States on Reciprocal Aid. Thiswould involve payment of about $38 million in the period up to the end of 1945.(iv) Certain Shipping Expenditures in Dollars.-This is a difficult itemwhich will have to be specially examined by the experts. At the present timethe British Treasury are having to find sums which may aggregate as much as$150 million a year to meet shipping expenditures in dollars^which have notbeen found eligible for Lend-Lease.A substantial part of this expenditure may be of a character not justifyingus in asking for it to be covered by Lend-Lease funds. But there is an importantfield of expenditure where existing rulings might well be reviewed. This includesfreight on dry cargo where it has, generally speaking, been held that such freightis eligible for Lend-Lease only if it arises from the movement from United Statesports of goods of Lend-Lease origin. In this connection we would ask thatfavourable consideration should be given to one item, not merely currently, butalso retrospectively, namely, the freight charges on munitions and other goodsshipped on United States vessels from Canadian ports. There seems to be no sufficient reason for ruling such freight to be ineligible. The amount involvednext year is small., perhaps $5 million; but there are arrears of some $40 million which we hope may be brought within any ruling which may be now given.Similar considerations apply to the freight on United States vessels carryingsuch commodities as off-shore sugar, and there may be other cases which mightbe covered by a suitable formula.A somewhat similar case occurs in the case of certain Allied vessels operating under various forms of control short of actual time charter where the arrange-ment is that the British Treasury reimburses the dollar deficits incurred as theresult of their trading, often by agreement, for sterling freights. This itemat present amounts to some $15 million a year and we hope that it might be covered by Lend-Lease.- (v) Machine Tools. In November 1943, it was decided that machine toolsshould be excluded from Lencl-Lease (despite the &quot; recapture &quot; provisions ofArticle 5 of the Lend-Lease Agreement) on the general grounds that it would notbe defensible to obtain on Lend-Lease assistance which might result in the per-manent strengthening of the capital equipment of British industry. The result hasbeen that we are buying machine tools for cash at a rate of $30 million per year.We suggest that it is appropriate that this decision should now be reviewed.Except for a trivial percentage, all the machine tools which are at present beingbought for cash are required for, and are being utilised on, war production. More-over, a substantial proportion of them are of so specialised a nature (e.g., machinesrequired for the production of equipment to increase fire power in naval vessels)that they cannot be regarded as of use for ordinary postrwar industrial production-tion; indeed the bulk of the remainder could not be so used without extensivemodification. Further, some tools are &quot;directly required for military end-useunder military control e.g., tools operated by R.A.F. personnel in aircraft repairdepots.
There seems to be abundant reason why machine tools for Naval. Vessels andR.A.F. Repair Depots can properly be restored to Lend-Lease; this limitedassistance would be in the neighbourhood of f 10 million. But since the great bulkof machine tools continues to be used for war production, we believe that theUnited States would be justified in granting a more ample measure of help byregarding all machine tools as eligible for Lend-Lease with the exception of anythat may not be required for utilisation on war production; this would mean a relief of about $27 million.(vi) The Repair and Equipment of Bomb-Damaged Houses. Generallyspeaking supplies for this purpose have been ruled ineligible and cash has to bepaid. The present practice means that the United States Government is ready tosupply on Lend-Lease tarpaulins and glass-substitute windows for bombed outworkers, but is not ready to supply materials which are essential to give them more effective and durable shelter, on the ground, it is understood, that these moredurable articles will have some use beyond the war. The present condition of housing, especially in the London area, has now become in fact one of the gravesthandicaps to efficiency. Since it is obvious that tarpaulins do not meet all the necessities of the case, and that under such conditions the British worker withthe best will in the world cannot do his best, even during the war, considerations of war efficiency are likely to involve us in practice in some cash dollar expenditure. The sums involved are small, and this context, in which only large sums are useful, is not perhaps the right place in which to raise the question.There is no doubt, nevertheless, that a new ruling in this field would give great satisfaction.(vii) This may be the right place in which to raise the question of civilianrelief supplies which may be required for recovered British territories in the far east (Burma, Malaya, Hong Kong, North Borneo) in the military period (i:e.,the first six months after recovery). If such supplies are ruled eligible on Lend-Lease this will not allow any relief in respect of the estimates given above, since no item has been included to meet this contingency, but it would, of course, help to prevent the actual outcome from proving worse than the estimates.Our representatives on the Joint Staff Mission have recently referred to theTreasury Delegation at Washington, certain telegrams which have passed with london on this matter. The United States War Department have stated that, if his Majesty&apos;s Government wish such essential civilian supplies to be given underLend-Lea,se, requests should be submitted for consideration &apos;&apos; through establishedchannels and in accordance with established procedures.&quot; The military planning authorities have not yet worked out what proportion of civilian supplies requiredfor Far Eastern territories in the military period will, in fact, have to be drawn from the United States. But a general ruling of principle at this stage would nevertheless be very helpful.9. There remain the outstanding claims relating to past transactionsreferred to above. There is a long story lying behind most of these, and the case for some of them is undoubtedly much stronger than for certain others. Thetotal amounts involved are very substantial indeed, approximating to $350million. A full statement can be prepared at short notice as a supplement to this^chapter, if desired,hfem&amp;a few illustrations may suffice to show that the time hascome when these questions deserve reconsideration, and it is suggested that aspecial sub-committee might be established to report upon them and any other proposals having a similar purpose.10. Two of the largest items relate to the financial principles which should govern the transitional period between the time when the United Kingdom waspaying cash for its munitions orders in the United States and the time when theywere fully covered by Lend-Lease.   Two examples of this are given below : ;(i) Aircraft and engines paid for in cash in dollars by the United Kingdomand subsequently diverted to the United States War Department.In this matter no consistent practice has been followed. We havealready received some $80 million for a diversion which took place between the 7th and 31st December, 1941. There was subsequently,however, a still larger-scale diversion which resulted from the Arnold-Portal agreement -an oral agreement made at a time of waremergency between military officials with no provision whatever for financial issues. This was in order to supply the United States war department at a critical moment with a large number of aircraft,which we had ordered and paid for and alone possessed.  The aircraft
turned over to the United States War Department as a result of thisagreement had been paid for by us in cash dollars to the amount ofabout f250 million.   Sir F. Phillips put forward our arguments for* repayment in a letter to Mr. Morgenthau (the 30th July, 1942), and again referred to our claim in a letter of the 8th October, 1942. since then the matter has been left in abeyamce. It can, of course, be claimed that this diversion has been subsequently compensated many times overby other aircraft supplied on Lend-Lease terms, and this argumentmight, if the other surrounding conditions were appropriate, carry the. day. Nevertheless, there does not seem to be any very valid argument,having regard to all the circumstances, and to the fact that we severelydepleted our balances to pay for these aircraft, why the financial settlement for the second diversion should be different than for thefirst.(ii) The second example relates to what used to be known as the &apos;&apos; take-outs &apos;&apos;of capital facilities. At the time when our financial difficulties were very great, items, additional to those previously dealt with, to the valueof $50 million were listed by Mr. Morgenthau in his letter of the28th September, 1942, as items which the United States might takeover and pay for in cash. Payments did in fact take place to theamount of $12 million. Of the balance, some sales to manufacturers and others have since been made. Nevertheless, if the settlementoriginally contemplated-by Mr. Morgenthau were to be completed asat the original date, a figure approaching some $38 million would remain to be paid. It would seem that with the improvement in ourbalances position a measure which had been originally intended to restore them was allowed to fall into abeyance; but it might perhaps be revived now that the difficulties which originally led to it haverecurred.li. It is not proposed that there should be any reduction in the scope of reciprocal Aid from the United Kingdom and Colonies either in the field of thesupply of raw materials or otherwise, although the scale of this, which has reachedabout a billion dollars in the last year, is undoubtedly one of the elements contri- .buting to our financial embarrassment. The British Government would prefer to continue such aid as heretofore. For a retrocession here would represent, onour part, a withdrawal from the principle of pooling, whereas it is precisely thehope of a confirmation and further implementing of that principle which underliesthe entire argument of this chapter. There would be great difficulties in the wayof a comprehensive application of any principle of financial pooling. But it isnot so difficult to take some practical measures which would bring us nearer, if only a very little nearer, to what the situation would have been if the principleof financial pooling could have been fully carried through.12. We have limited ourselves in this chapter to putting forward suggestions which would seem to us to be practicable without departing from the same general principles of Lend-Lease and the like which have served our two countries so welland so successfully hitherto.Chapter 4.I. Lend-Lease Requirements of Australia, New Zealand and India.1. The case for assistance in the first year of Stage II, which has been putforward in the earlier sections of this paper, is primarily one which relates tothe United Kingdom only. It should be noted, however, that in accordance withpast practice, the programmes as submitted comprise, in certain cases, therequirements of the Dominions concerned (Australia and New Zealand), and ofIndia. Thus, in the munitions field, the programmes comprise all supplies required from the United States for India, together with all supplies for Australia and New Zealand, other than aircraft and certain components whichwill be obtained on direct Lend-Lease and are not included in the foregoing pro-grammes. In the non-munitions field, the figures in respect of oil and shippinginclude requirements for Australia, New Zealand and India, but that is not thecase as regards food, raw materials or civilian goods.
2. The question of Lend-Lease assistance for Australia, New Zealand andIndia is finally, of course, a matter for the United States Government, and therepresentatives of the Dominion Governments concerned, and of the Governmentof India. Nevertheless, in order to give a global picture of Lend-Lease demands from the British Commonwealth, it has been thought helpful to indicate in this statement the scope of the direct Dominion and Indian Lend-Lease requirements,so far as they are known. No doubt, opportunity will be given as may be requiredfor the representatives of the Dominions concerned and of India to discuss theQuestions arising from this paper so far as their Governments may be more directly concerned and in the light of special considerations which apply in theirrespective cases.3. It will be appreciated that in all three countries concerned the strategic requirements of the Pacific War may necessitate a continued degree ofmobilisation for war to an extent greater than in the United States or the UnitedKingdom, while the presence of large numbers of United States military forcesin or near the territories concerned may mean that the provision of goods and services on reciprocal aid will continue, to absorb a considerable portion of the productive capacity and man-power of all three countries.II. Australia.4. The Australian requirements during the first year of Stage II may besummarised as follows :i--Note. A conversion rate of $3-20 per  1 Australian has been adopted inthese calculations.A, Direct Military Requirements.These are the aircraft and components mentioned in paragraph 1. The scale of requirements under this head will be agreed with the U.S. War department in view of the fact that the supplies are, in effect, required by the United StatesCommand in the South-Western Pacific. Provisionally, it is thought that thecost may be of the order of over $200 million.5th L/L        1st YearAppropriation.

Reciprocal Aid to the United States.It is anticipated that during Stage II Australia, New Zealand and India willcontinue to give reciprocal aid, but the extent of such aid depends on a numberof factors, including the strength of the United States forces in or near thecountries in question, and it is not possible, therefore, to give at present any estimate of its cost.Chapter 5.I. The Export White Paper and Freedom to Export.The President agreed at Quebec that if the United Kingdom is to begin topay its way it is essential that the United States should not attach any conditions to supplies delivered to Great Britain on Lend-Lease which would jeopardise the recovery of her export trade. Estimates concerning the prospective balanceof trade in 1945, given in Annex A below, which were not available at the timeof the Quebec Conference, confirm to the full the urgency of measures which will allow us to make a beginning with a recovery of our export trade.As mentioned in the introduction, the volume of British exports in 1944is below 30 per cent, of the pre-war level. They will have to rise to five timestheir 1944 figure before we shall reach equilibrium in post-war conditions.It is proposed, therefore, that as from the 1st December, 1944, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, acting in agreement with the United States Administration, should withdraw the White Paper of September 1941 (which was a unilateral declaration on their part made at a time when the United States was a neutral), so that from that date British exporters will be free unconditionally to export any articleto any market (apart, of course, from any regulations which the British Govern-ment may find it necessary to impose in connection with the Japanese war forother purposes of their own).
In order that any complications arising from this may be minimised, greatrare has been taken in drawing up both the munitions and the non-munitionsprogrammes to exclude items which might give rise to special difficulty.In particular, all steel and other metals, minerals and chemicals and variousmiscellaneous items have been excluded from the non-munitions programme (theonly items of this character being certain direct military needs included in the munitions programme), and the programme is confined to agricultural and forestry products and synthetic rubber; while in the list of manufactured goods to be included in the non-munitions programme, all items have been excludedexcept opencast mining machinery and agricultural machinery and accessories.As regards the use in export of the remaining raw materials still includedin the Lend-Lease programme, we propose in general the same condition whichhas hitherto applied, namely, that, where segregation is impracticable, the supplyof such materials on Lend-Lease shall not exceed the domestic consumption ofthe material in question, any excess over this amount obtained from UnitedStates sources being paid for in cash. (Perhaps the same principle should also apply in the case of materials similarly supplied by the United Kingdom Govern-ment to the United States on Reciprocal Aid.) Where, however, materials whichare identical or can be, at least partially, substituted for one another, suchas synthetic and natural rubber, and.oil products, raw and refined^ are suppliedboth on Lend-Lease and on reciprocal aid, there shall be, on the principle of reciprocity, no restrictions on the use of the material by either recipient partyfor export and otherwise. In fact, supplies of natural rubber on Reciprocal Aidare of approximately the same amount as the supplies of synthetic rubber onLend-Lease, and the distribution of the responsibility to find oil for the combinedeffort is determined through a combined pooling system by which the position should be sufficiently safeguarded.It may be that there are further matters of detail which will requirediscussion. But we hope that the freedom to export which is now essential tous should not, in view of the prospective state of our balances, lead to any furtherexclusions from Lend-Lease eligibility of any significant amount.We hope, further, that there can be in this connexion a clean-cut and a newstart at the 1st December, 1944, to be taken as a fixed date irrespective of thedate of termination of the German war.
ANNEX A.Statistics Bearing on the Dimensions of the United Kingdom&apos;s Problemof External Finance in the Transition.I. British Overseas Liabilities at the end of June 1944.1. The grand aggregate of the net liabilities (i.e., after deducting similarBritish assets abroad) amounted to $11;223 million at the 30th June, 1944,compared with $8,588 million a year earlier. This can be broken up into thefollowing main groups, certain of which are clearly much less burdensome in thenear future than others : (a) United States and Canada (including governmentalloans) Canada   ...United Statesowingto   SouthThe   Special  Account   BalancesAmerica and Neutral Europe-Portugal (a gold liability)ArgentinaBrazilOther South and Central AmericaOther Neutral Europe ...(c) The Balances of the Sterling Area Dominions australia new Zealand    ...       ...South Africa(d) The Balances of the major Sterling Area countries the currency reserves of which we hold IndiaEgypt     ...       ....      ..........     ....Eire(e) The  Crown  Colonies and Mandates the currencyreserves of which we hold MalayaPalestineOther Colonies and MandatesWest African ColoniesEast African ColoniesBritish West IndiesCeylonOther British Africa (excluding South Africa)Hong Kong(/)   Certain Allies and others which do not normally keepsubstantial balances in London Iraq       ... ....      ..:      ...      ...Free  France and  Colonies   and  French  blockedbalancesGreeceNorwayNetherlands and ColoniesChinaBelgium and Colonies   ...PersiaIceland$ million640-0367-2266-4240-8102-064-463-6436-0100-896-43,298-01,278-4&apos; 362-8382-8380-0337-2314-4302-4221-6165-6141-6130-4254-8242-0230-8185-2209-689-284-051-243-62. The chief difficulties in the early post-war period are likely to arise fromthe last three categories above. All these countries will seek to spend their sterling balances on a considerable scale as soon as goods and shipping are freely available,.in so far as they are free to do so. Under the existing arrangements, the countriesin the sterling area are free to spend their sterling balances anywhere in the sterling Area without restriction, and to obtain external currencies on condition that they are required for essential goods which cannot be obtained from the sterling Area.   It is only the shortages of goods and shipping which have made
it financially possible to continue these arrangements unchanged during the last three years, and it is not anticipated that a similar latitude to spend sterling balances outside the Sterling Area can be continued much longer. On this assumption, and provided the Sterling Area countries are prepared to continue tosell their exports to the United Kingdom on the present basis, no acute financial problem will arise in the early period. The balances will have to be repaid, as and when it becomes possible, through British exports. Thus the existence ofthe above large volume of sterling balances affects the financial position of theearly post-war period much more because they affect the amount of the furthersums which the United Kingdom can afford to borrow, than because theUnited Kingdom can be called upon to repay these monies immediately, since in the nature of things this is impossible.3. Nevertheless, there must be some exceptions to the restriction of the useof the abnormal balance. The members of the Sterling Area have placed at thedisposal of the London Exchange Control all their earnings of external currencies,more particularly dollars. Moreover, the majority of them have entrusted thewhole, or nearly the whole, of their currency reserves to London, thus enabling theBritish Government to pay their way over a considerable part of the world interms of paper backed by sterling Treasury Bills in London. When the holders of this paper are again in a position to purchase goods, there will be a heavymoral responsibility on the British Government to do anything which lies in their power to operate the above system with as much moderation and as much regard tothe freedom of international trade generally as is financially possible. Some partof the British gold reserves, though in present circumstances it may have to be avery small part, must, therefore, be regarded as available for the use of the restof the Sterling Area. Equitable and satisfactory means of allocating theamounts, if any, which may turn out to be available when we know the size of our reserves at the end of Stage II have not yet been worked out. Those colonies which are not themselves substantial dollar earners, and the entire currencyreserves of which have been accumulated in London, would seem to have a particularly strong claim to any ration of gold or dollars which can be spared.4. It is not the purpose of this memorandum to offer, or to debate, theultimate solution. Nevertheless there are certain general principles to which wemust hold henceforward with the utmost resolution, if we are to face realisticallythe consequences of the overseas financial policy which we have adopted during thewar. We do not intend to seek outside assistance in meeting the war debts which we have incurred to the other Sterling Area countries and to neutrals. We propose to meet these over a period of years in the shape of british exports and perhaps, to a small extent, by a further disposal of our pre-wTarinvestments in their territories. But we shall ask those concerned to agree that,in view of the origin of the debts, the interest element shall be reduced to aminimum or altogether extinguished. That is to say, it is the capital sum whichwe shall endeavour to repay.. Furthermore, subject to only minor exceptions,repayment must take the form of direct British exports, additional to what we need to pay for necessary imports, and cannot take the form of free exchange, ofwhich we see no prospect of possessing a sizeable surplus in the foreseeable future.The abnormal war balances can be made available to those who own them only by instalments and only subject to these conditions. During the transitional period we hope to be able to allow certain transfers of indebtedness between our creditors within the Sterling Area. But in general w^e cannot agree to borrowoutside currencies in order to make sterling war indebtedness available to buyexports from outside. For we should have no sufficient expectation of being ableto repay such loans. All this is rooted in the inescapable necessities of the case.5. It has been indicated above that the willingness of the United kingdom to borrow will be a limiting factor, as well as the willingness of other countries to lend. The United Kingdom have already entered into obligations for thepurposes of the war on so vast a scale that their capacity of repayment even overmany years will be gravely strained. It is not the intention of the British Govern-ment to enter into further obligations on a scale or on terms which mightjeopardise the security&quot; of ultimate repayment of the capital, either of existing or of subsequent loans. Even if the interest element can be kept down to aninsignificant figure, this consideration may well impose a narrower limit on theaggregate of future credit facilities than is set on the other side of the account by the willingness of lenders to lend. The British Government are determinednot to borrow more or on more onerous terms than they have a reasonable expecta-tion of being able to repay over a term of years.
II. The Gold and Dollar Balances of the United Kingdom.* 6. A year before the outbreak of war our reserves were substantial and stood at $4,200 million. The expectation of war led to a large-scale withdrawal offoreign balances, and at the outbreak of war we were reduced to $2,450 million.Shortly after the commencement of Lend-Lease (April 1941) we were practicallycleaned out, having &quot;gold and dollar reserves of $264 million with $252 million gold liabilities against them, so that our-net reserves were down to $12 million.Thereafter came the R.F.C. Loan; the old (pre-Lend-Lease) commitments hadbeen substantially met; almost all our current requirements from United states were for a time lentrleased; and the Sterling Area, was beginning to gainsubstantial earnings from the United States troops; with the result that our reserves began to rise quite steadily. They reached a peak of about $1,750 million in August 1944. Unfortunately, a livelier awareness by the United states administration of this recovery in our reserves than of the much greater increaseof our liabilities led to a substantial curtailment of Lend-Lease facilities, and atthe same time a reduction of our earning power corresponding to the increase inreverse Mutual Aid, with the result that we became unduly dependent onprecarious earnings from the United States troops in the Sterling Area. With areduction of these earnings as the United States Forces move into Europe andas the war in the Pacific becomes based to a! lesser extent on Australia, our dollaraccount is already on the wrong side, so that our reserves have begun to fall.7. Fuller statistics of the gold and dollar reserves in relation to ourliabilities are given below : % million. *	r 31st Aug., 1938.	31st Aug., 1939.	31st Dec, 1939.	31st Dec, 1941.	31st Dec, 1942.	31st Dec, 1943.	30th June, 1944.

Nearly the whole of the very large decrease in reserves between the endof 1939 and the end of 1941 was used to pay for war expenditure in the UnitedStates. The net increase in Reserves during the Lend-Lease period up-to-date from 1st March, 1941 to 1st September, 1944, was not the result of our receivingLend-Lease assistance on such a scale that the United Kingdom&apos;s normal currentearnings of dollars exceeded its requirements. For example, the normal dollar earnings of the United Kingdom fell short of its own dollar requirements by$287 million in 1942 and by $240 million in 1943; and its total dollar earnings,including pay of United States troops in United Kingdom, fell short by$237 million in 1942 and $50 million in 1943. The increase in reserves was partly due to the disposal or pledging of capital assets and partly to the dollar earnings of the rest of the Sterling Area, the chief sources from which we obtained theincrease in our Reserves, after the commencement of Lend-Lease, being as follows.At the end of August 1944, when our net reserves reached their peak of$1,748 million, the cumulative increase since the commencement of Lend-Lease onthe 1st March, 1941 (when our reserves stood at $169 million) was. $1,579 million.

No exact analysis of thesereceipts is available for the broken period of 1941 or for the broken period of 1944.But, as it happens, the net excess thus earned in the latter of these two periodsalmost exactly balanced the net deficit in the former of them. Thus it was the excess earnings of the rest of the Sterling Area in the years 1942 and 1943 overthe dollar deficit of the United Kingdom in these two years which almost exactlymade up the difference, namely, $556 million, between the total growth of reserves and the capital receipts specified above.$ million.United Kingdom  current  account with united States  ...United States troops in United KingdomRest of Sterling Area current accountwith United States    ...      .......United States troops in rest of SterlingArea19A2.-28750. 1191941943.-24019015036586465III. The Loss of Pre-War Overseas Assets.9. The above aggregates of war indebtedness . incurred by the UnitedKingdom take no account of loss of pre-war overseas assets disposed of duringthe war in order that the growth of war indebtedness might be correspondinglyless. The amount of such disposals was estimated by the Chancellor of theExchequer in April last at about $4 billion. The balance which remains is largelyunmarketable and only realisable, if at all, by special arrangements, so that itis not easy to estimate its capital value. A recent attempt, however, has beenmade to estimate, both what has been lost and what still remains, on an incomebasis, as follows : Net Income from Investments Abroad ($ million).1938.Lord Kindersley&apos;s estimates ofamounts distributed as interestand dividends to United King-dom residents ...Undistributed profits, UnitedKingdom office expenses, &amp;c. ...Less, payments to non-residentson their investments in UnitedKingdom       ...      ...      ...740120860601943.Bank of England provisionalestimates on a similar basis toLord Kindersley&apos; sUndistributed profits, UnitedKingdom office expenses, &amp;c. ...say45610456040United Kingdom Net Income ...   800 52010. It would be unwise to capitalise the income for 1938 and for 1943 at theti!mf ra^e- Dividends on equities are probably now higher than in 1938, andthe fall m capital outstanding no.doubt somewhat greater than simple comparison of the two incomes would indicate.   Nevertheless the broad conclusion seems to
be that about one-third has been disposed of or otherwise lost as a result ofhostilities. If the pre-war value was around $14 billion, the remaining value is now around $10 billion.11. Against this, we have to reckon with a net indebtedness on short termof $12 billion as at the end of 1914. The year 1945 will add $2-*- to $3 billionto this, and the post-war transition, on the basis of the most optimisticassumptions, will add not less than another $4 to $5 billion. (This calculationneglects both the small excess of reserves over net short-term liabilities at thebeginning of the war and. the unpredictable level of reserves atvthe end of it.)Thus the United Kingdom will have entered the war with a net creditor positionof (say) $14 billion and will end it with a net debtor position of (say) $9 billion,showing a net deterioration of $23 billion in the overseas position. The other side of the medal is that almost every other country in the world, apart fromthe enemy and occupied countries, has improved its overseas position to an extent,in the aggregate, approximately equal in amount. It may be mentioned thatthe liabilities of $19 billion, with which we shall come out of the transitional period, represent the total exports of the United Kingdom for a period of six years on the basis of their pre-war volume.IV. The United Kingdom^ Prospective Balance of Overseas Trade.12. An attempt has recently been made to forecast the prospective balanceof trade in 1945 more fully than has been attempted hitherto. Any such estimates in time of war are necessarily most precarious. The following summary, whichis the best we can do at the moment, is submitted subject to all reservations.Particular attention is called to the comments which follow overleaf, whichmainly relate to the more difficult and uncertain items.United Kingdom Balance of Payments (Non-munitions).Requirements.Imports (f.o.b.)* 1.

Comments on Preceding Table.(i) The above table excludes munitions received from the United States and canada, on the requirements side, and also excludes munitions manufactured inthe United Kingdom and delivered on Mutual Aid on the receipts side. It doesnot relate, however, quite strictly to non-munitions, since Item 10, War Expendi-ture, includes some payments for munitions from other parts of the world,e.g., India, and Item 15, Military Receipts from Empire Governments other thanCanada, includes what is in effect some reimbursement for munitions manufac-tured in United Kingdom supplies to Empire Forces.(ii) No deduction has been made in respect of non-munitions supplied on united States Lend-Lease or Canadian Mutual Aid. The Lend-Lease aid fornon-munitions proposed in other parts of this paper amounts, in round figures, tof2-75 billion. The amount of Mutual Aid from Canada is not yet determined,but it is at present contemplated to propose some figure in the neighbourhood of1600 million Canadian to cover non-munitions. Thus, if these proposals were tobe accepted, the remaining cash deficit would be of the order of f 3 billion, whichwould have to be met by the further disposal of assets or by incurring further debt.(iii) The above shows that, after allowing for $2-75 billion of Lend-Leaseaid, there still remains more than $900 million of United States dollar expendi-ture, which the United Kingdom would have to meet in cash out of its dollar earnings and other resources. Certain proposals relating to this have been madein Chapter 3.(iv) There are, moreover, further liabilities not covered by the above table.In particular, it includes nothing for liabilities incurred through the use ofmilitary currencies in Europe, e.g., credits thus created in favour of Allies onaccount of military currencies to meet the pay of British troops.(v) The most formidable abnormal item is, of course, Item 10 for war expenditure. As already pointed out. this excludes munitions on Lend-Leaseor Mutual Aid and also expenditure in military currency. It is made up asfollows :-:. $ million.1,360India    ... --- 240Egypt   ... --- ...        160Australia --- 100Palestine --- ---                &quot;&apos;      &apos;           80South Africa ... - - -      - - -                            60Persia   ... - - &quot;&apos;      ...          40Iraq      - - - - - -&quot;&quot;                         ...         40.-Others   ...Throughout the past three years this has been the main cause of the growingindebtedness of the United Kingdom. It is not generally appreciated that, quite apart from the large quantities of stores which are shipped to British forces overseas, more particularly in the Middle East and in India, very large cashexpenditures are incurred in those areas. The United Kingdom has, in fact, bornethe main cost of the war in so far as it involves local expenditures over a verylarge area stretching from North Africa to Burma. It will be seen that even in1945 such expenditure in the Middle East countries is estimated at $400 million.Not long ago it was running at double this rate. It should, however, be emphasised that these estimates are particularly precarious. They are based on the latest figures provided by the War Office as to the personnel which present strategicdecisions will require us to keep in the areas in question. But they are capableof considerable modification upwards or downwards in accordance with changingstrategic decisions consequent on the course of the war.(vi) The receipts entered in respect of exports need further explanation. Inrecent months British exports have been running at the rate of about $80 million a month. For the year as a whole it is expected that they will not quite reach$1 billion. The proposals relating to man-power set forth in another section ofthis paper should, if they are carried fully into effect, release sufficient man-power in the course of the year to increase exports by about $1 billion, approximatelydoubling them. The estimate in the above table assumes that, in spite ofinevitable time-lags, this is carried fully into effect, and is arrived at as follows :It is estimated that British exports will reach a figure of $2,000 million. To thisis added $40 million for diamonds not of British origin shipped to the UnitedStates. From this is deducted $200 million for time-lags in payment and$100 million for relief exports through UNRRA, &amp;c, which will not be paid*or, leaving estimated cash receipts of $1,740 million.  We believe, however, that
this figure is highly optimistic. A great deal depends on whether Britishexporters can be immediately released to take orders. Otherwise there is a serious danger that man-power which is released will find its way into making goods to^satisfy the hungry home market. It will therefore be a great achievement of organisation if the figure here estimated is actually reached.(vii) Item 17, Other Receipts (unidentifiable), is difficult to explain. it includes certain sources of invisible income, such as insurance and commissions,but in the main it-reflects the. inability of the British statisticians to identify allthe sources from which our income has. reached us in recent years. An analysis of past expenditure shows that a balancing figure of about this amount is requiredto reconcile the results. It may come from the disposal of capital assets whichhave not been separately reported as such; or it may be merely a balancing figure which results from various items of expenditure having been over-estimated, and various items of receipts under-estimated. It is dangerous to rely on so uncertaina source, which may be the product of erroneous statistics in the past, but sofar its analysis has baffled all enquirers.V. The United Kingdom&apos;s Gold and Dollar Reserve Position at the end of stage II.13. The United Kingdom&apos;s balance of trade with the United States in1945, as estimated in IV above, on-the assumption of Lend-Lease assistance fornon-munitions on a scale not exceeding $2-75 billion, shows a net deficit withthe United States on United Kingdom account of about $400 million, which is considerably larger than in any year since Lend-Lease came into operation (thecorresponding deficit in 1942 was $287 million, and in 1943 $240 million, thefigures for 1944 being not yet available). Receipts from the pay of united states forces in the United Kingdom in 1945 are estimated, for obvious reasons, atthe greatly reduced figure of $60 million. 1945 is the first year in which the requirement of cash payment for a number of articles previously on Lend-lease and&quot; the delivery of raw materials on Reciprocal Aid coincide with diminishedreceipts in respect of the United States Forces.14. The British gold and dollar position depends, however, not merely onthe United Kingdom balance with the United States, but also on the gold and dollar receipts and outgoings of the rest of the Sterling Area. In previous yearsthese sources have come to the rescue on an important scale; for example, in 1943we received nearly $515 million from these sources. In &quot;1945, on the other hand,it is expected that the rest of the Sterling Area will contribute no more than$100 million. This also is due to a combination of two circumstances. Theincrease in Reciprocal Aid in food and raw materials, which only comes into full effect in 1945, has the effect of substantially reducing the dollar earningpower of these countries and will turn the commercial balance of the rest of the sterling Area with the United States into a deficit of $100 million. At the sametime, the heavy earnings from United States Forces, which previously made this scale of Reciprocal Aid possible without excessively adverse results, arefalling away and are estimated in 1945 at no more than $200 million.The estimated balance sheet of the gold and dollar reserve position as a wholein 1945 is as follows :-$ Million. I $ Million.United Kingdom earnings from united States Forces     ... 60Ditto for rest of Sterling Area 200Net receipts of gold    ...       ... 160Reduction of reserves420355$775United Kingdom deficit with united States on balance oftrade accountDitto for rest of Sterling AreaDollar payments to thirdcountriesIncrease in gold liabilities40010022550$775The estimate of earnings from United States Forces in the Sterling Area isconjectural. Receipts in the United Kingdom are put at $60 million This ison the assumption that Stage II begins at the 1st January, 1945. If the german war drags on this figure will be somewhat, but not much, larger. The australian government inform us that they expect no significant income from this source.In fact, the American army acquired an excessive amount of Australian balancesm the first half of 1944, and are expected even so early as the second half of 1944
9 * ri61 Ito withdraw something like $40 million from the balances already set up, ratherthan increase them. Receipts in India on this account depend on how far out-goings are met by sales of gold on behalf of the United States Treasury. At onetime such sales of gold largely absorbed this source of dollars. More recentlysuch sales have been on a much smaller scale. It is a matter of policy at whatlevel of price it is decided to press sales pf gold on a larger scale. Provisionally,without knowing accurately the strength of United States Forces in India oversuccessive dates in 1945, we estimate rather doubtfully $200 million from this source, which may easily turn out too high. As regards gold, we have had toabandon the policy of assisting the Government of India and other Middle EastGovernments in their anti-inflation campaign by providing a certain amount ofgold for sale in these areas, and the estimate of our net receipts of gold is on theassumption that sales of gold in India and the Middle East, which are now coming to an end, will not be resumed in 1945. Dollar expenditure on account of third countries includes payments for sugar and oil from dollar sources in the carribbean and Venezuela and certain refunds to Canada of United States dollar expenditure incurred on our behalf.15. If these estimates, which are necessarily based in part on conjectureand can easily be falsified by the progress of events, are correct, the UnitedKingdom will enter the year 1946 with liquid reserves amounting tof 1,130 million, and overseas liabilities (which are, however, in terms of sterling and cannot be freely converted into gold or dollars) of between $14 andfl5 billion.16. The serious reversal of the trend of the reserve position as shown above is due, it will be seen, to a combination of circumstances which were always likelyto produce that result in the long run. During the period when the sterling area had considerable earnings from the United States Forces, a number of marginal items were taken off Lend-Lease and the scale of Reciprocal Aid,particularly for raw materials, was greatly increased. The above result was bound to follow if the latter measures were to continue into a period when ourincome on the former account was falling away. It is for this reason that theproposals in Chapter 3 are put forward.17. Our need to hold liquid reserves is based on a number of different considerations : (a) We must hold a minimum reserve against grave contingencies such as war, which cannot be put below $1 billion.(&amp;) We must hold working balances adequate to cover our short-term require-ments in international commerce in conditions of normal trade, after our external balance of trade is substantially in equilibrium.(c) We must hold reserves against the needs of the Sterling Area, particu-larly in the case of those countries of. which we keep the currencyreserves so that their external resources wholly consist of sterling balances in London.(d) We must hold reserves against our needs in the transitional period of stage III, in which our balance of payments will still be heavilyadverse, since we must expect to have to cover in gold some part atleast of our deficit with the rest of the world.As regards (a) and (b) above, no more need be said. As regards (c), it mustbe emphasised that the reserves of the United Kingdom constitute, broadly speaking, the reserves of the Sterling Area as&apos;a whole. No other countries ofthe Sterling Area (with the exception, of South Africa, which, as the world&apos;sgreatest gold producer, is in a special position) have any appreciable holdings ofgold or of foreign currencies other than sterling. Their foreign currencyreceipts have gone into the United Kingdom pool, and they have looked to usto meet their essential foreign currency needs. All these countries are short ofgoods, and will have problems of reconstruction and restoration of civilianeconomy to face. They will seek to convert some part of their accumulatedsterling balances into foreign currencies for these purposes. Whether and howfar their demands can be met will depend on the adequacy of the reserves wethen hold. So far as the early transitional period is concerned, our main anxietiesrelate to (d). It is impossible at present to give any close estimate of the prospective drain. Some indication of its possible magnitude, however, can beobtained by looking back to the estimated balance of overseas trade in 1945 setforth in paragraph 12 above.   This shows, on the assumption that Lend-Lease
and Mutual Aid come to an end with the end of Stage II, that we shall enterStage III with a deficit running at the rate of about $6 billion a year. To what extent can we hope that this will be reduced during the first year of Stage III ?*18. To begin with our import requirements^ There will be a largereduction in the case of oil, and we shall no longer have to buy raw materials and food for Reciprocal Aid, making an economy of (say) $400 . millionaltogether. On the other hand, the size of the adult population requiringfood and raw materials for employment will be increased by the demobilisation of the Forces; so that, whilst the character of our imports will be to a certain extent changed, the aggregate may be more rather than less. The imports weshould like to have are not likely to be much less than $6 billion. By extremeeconomy, however, the use of stocks and strict import control, it is possible thatthe figure might be kept down during the first year nearer to $5 billion.19. The other main items on the debit side of the account, namely, theuse of non-British shipping and war expenditure overseas, which are at presentcosting about $3^ billion between them, should be very greatly diminished in due course. Nevertheless, these items of expenditure will not cease immediately.For there will be a period of uncertain duration during which our Forces arebeing brought home from overseas, and perhaps a longer period during whichwe remain responsible for policing certain extensive areas of the world. Inaddition, there will doubtless be many deferred liabilities in respect of earlierdates which will be brought to account against us for payment in the first year of Stage III. Whilst, therefore, we must take steps to reduce these outgoingsas fast as possible, they are bound to remain high in the first year of Stage III,and are likely to continue on a significant scale at least into the second year.20. On the credit side of the account, military receipts from empire governments and from the pay of United States and Canadian Forces in theUnited Kingdom will rapidly disappear, approximately offsetting the gain under18 above.21. There remain, however, two items, namely, shipping and exports,where we must hope for a large and progressive increase in income. Neverthe-less, as regards shipping we cannot expect the improvement which should beultimately possible, until we have rebuilt our mercantile marine. In 1938 thenet income from United Kingdom shipping earnings was some $400 million.By end-1944 it is expected that United Kingdom tonnage will amount to some12 million gross tons of ocean-going shipping, compared with 16 million grosstons in 1938. Even if by, say 1950, we rebuild our mercantile marine to its former level, and freights are assumed to rise by 60 per cent, compared to 1938,United Kingdom shipping earnings in terms of money in 1950 would be no more than 55 per cent, above 1938. On this basis a net income of $640 million,as compared with $400 million in 1938, might be a reasonable estimate. Since,however, we are already taking credit for $500 million, no significant improve-ment can be expected on this heading so early as 1946. The effective saving in1946 is that already mentioned, namely, in our outgoings in respect of shippingwhich we do not ourselves own. The prospects of exports are dealt with separately in the last section of this Annex.22. Taking one thing with another, it would seem very optimistic to expect that the net deficit could be brought below $3 billion in the first year of Stage III.Nor are we likely to reach equilibrium in the second, or even in the third, year of Stage III. We shall have managed very well if the accumulated deficit in stage III before we reach equilibrium is less than a figure between $4 and$5 billion.23.   It will be observed that this figure is reached on the assumption (a) that no part of the abnormal sterling balances is repaid during thisperiod, which probably means in practice that the rest of the sterling area could not spend in gold and dollars more than their &quot;currentearnings in gold and dollars;(b) that no significant part of our exports is on credit terms; and(c) that the reorganisation and pacification of the world will not make on usany financial claims whatever.24. It is unlikely that no additional obligations will fall on us under anyof these heads.  Thus, the sums which we shall be required to raise after the war* See note * to table in paragraph 12.
  Qidto meet current expenditure are likely to exceed $4 or $5 billion. Even if, aswe hope, arrangements are made during Stage II which will enable us to maintain our reserves near their present level, not more than half a billion of these reserveswill be available during the early years of Stage III towards meeting the abovedeficit.25. . Particular attention has already been called in the Introduction andin Chapter 3 to the embarrassments which may arise affecting the - United states as well as the United Kingdom Government, if the latter is unable to finance thepolitical and other obligations arising out of the war and the peace which otherwise it would be natural for her to share and to assume. It is not desired or intendedon this occasion to discuss the question how the financial problems of Stage iii will be best handled when the time comes. The present discussions are limited toStage II. Nevertheless, it is relevant to Stage II arrangements to emphasise here that it will be particularly difficult in Stage III to replenish the UnitedKingdom&apos;s stock of liquid cash in the form of gold and dollars. Such credits asbecome available on suitable terms are likely to be tied to particular exports, and cannot always be married against pressing demands of another kind and in another quarter of the world. It is, therefore, of the highest importance tomaintain the British liquid reserves above the danger level during Stage II, whenthe conditions will be such that by proper arrangements this is possible.26. At the present time British visible exports are not sufficient to financeone-tenth of our total overseas requirements. Even after full allowance has beenmade for Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid from Canada, British exports are notcurrently sufficient to finance one-seventh of our remaining overseas requirements.The heavy deficit forecast for 1945 is after making the very optimistic assumptionthat our exports in the course of 1945 will be running at about double their figure in 1944. It is obvious, therefore, what a vast scale of industrial reorganisationwill be required to raise exports sufficiently to restore equilibrium.27. The whole lay-out of the British war economy was dominated duringthe formative period by one supreme consideration : for a time we and theCommonwealth were alone in the war, and alone capable of bringing militaryweapons to bear upon the enemy. By the sale of the gold and foreign assets that had been accumulated over a century, we could call for aid upon the industrialeffort of nations which still remained neutral. It was wise and it was necessarythat the British military effort should be inflated far beyond any level that couldbe maintained by our own unaided industrial efforts, even (which then was farfrom the case), when they reached full fruition.28. In the first weeks of the war, the extent of our gold and foreign assets and the current rate at which they were being dispersed were surveyed. It was immediately decided that measures were necessary to conserve them, not only bydrastic limitation of less essential imports, but also by an export drive.29. Before the war there had been about 1,750,000 persons engaged in theproduction of British exports about 1,300,000 were in actual mining and manufacture, and about 450,000 of those in transport, distribution and other occupations were performing services ancillary to export. At mid-1940 thesefigures had been appreciably reduced, but the total engaged in direct export was still in excess of 1,000,000. The supersession of Cash and Carry by Lend-Leasein the spring of 1941 was the chief cause of an immense change between mid-1940and mid-1942. By the latter date, only some 440,000 were still engaged in mining or manufacture for export, and by mid-1944 there were only about 300,000so engaged. Thus- the effect of Lend-Lease, together with other similar aid from empire countries, the disposal of British assets and the accumulation of sterlingliabilities in London, has been to make possible the transfer to the war effort of some 1,400,000 former workers in the export industries. These measuresenabled the United Kingdom very greatly to increase the impact upon germany at a critical phase of the war. But the transfer from export to munitions wasonly possible, because we were enabled, through Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid,to receive a great quantity of imports without corresponding exports; and our economy is now organised on that basis.   The process took time to establish, andVI. British Exports in Stage III.
will take time to reverse.. The result is that we are not, and cannot for some considerable time to come, be in a position to pay for our minimum andinescapable import needs. . -*30. In other words, it is precisely the operation of Lend-Lease and mutual aid which, by making it possible for us to carry on the war without substantialexports, allowed us to pursue the policy of abandoning any effort to maintainthem. Thus, our prospective difficulties are an actual consequence of the means by which we have been enabled to devote so large a proportion of our totalman-power to war mobilisation.31. Since the following trade statistics have not been made availablepreviously, it may be worth while to give them in some detail. The value ofBritish exports fell from $1,884 million in 1938 to $928 million in 1943. when allowance is made for the rise in prices, the quantity of exports was reduced to only 29 per cent, of the 1938 level : Exports of Produce and Manufactures of the United Kingdom.Value of exportsas recorded.1938 ...1939 ...1940 ...1941 ...1942 ....1943 ...1944 (estimated on basis of nine months)$ m.1,8841,7601,6441,4601,080928960Quantity of exports (recordedexports revaluedat 1935 prices).1938 = 100.100947356362928Note. The figures for 1942 and subsequent years exclude military aircraftmunitions as such and military motor vehicles (but not tyres which areincluded). On the other hand, they include exports on Reciprocal Aid($15 million, approximately, in 1944) and some exports to N.A.A.F.I.,Y.M.C.A., and other organisations for sale to British troops abroad($12 million, approximately, in 1944).The figures also include exports of war requirements to Russia andother Allies to an amount estimated at $92 million for 1944. Theseexports, however, must be regarded as in some sense abnormal, since insome cases they are &quot;supplied on special financial terms, and in many instances they are not of a character which will build up.future trade by establishing markets.The result of these qualifications is to increase the distance whichwe shall have to cover to reach the target for future exports which wehave set ourselves. But, since the precise effect of the qualifications is,in the main, highly speculative, they have not been taken into account in the rest of this paper.Attempts have been made, as far as possible, to export goods which do not makegreat demands on man-power or on shipping. Thus, exports of spirits have, in comparison with other items, been kept at a high level. Exports of textiles,which are produced mainly by female labour, have declined heavily, but less thanthose of engineering products. The export of motor cars and commercial vehicles has virtually ceased since 1941, and the amounts of iron and steelmanufactures, machinery and coal sent to overseas markets have been drasticallycut to the minimum quantities essential to the war effort.

For commercial vehicles and chassis, total exports in the first sixmonths of 1942 were 2,410 while non-military exports were 117; for motor cars, all exportsduring the first half of 1942 were non-military.32. It has been already explained that we are aiming, probably toooptimistically, at doubling the volume of British exports in 1945, as comparedwith 1944, reaching a total value, apart from a time-lag in payment, pf about$2 billion. This assumes a price level in 1945 of 180 to 185 per cent, of theprice level in 1938. Later calculations confirm an estimate, first made some time ago, that in order to reach equilibrium, apart from, repayment of war debt, thevolume of British exports must rise 50 per cent, above 1938. If we assume aprice level of 180 per cent, of pre-war, this means in terms of money a.n exporttrade of about $5 billions. Thus, in order to reach equilibrium, the level of exports in 1945, the target for which is already double the 1944 figure, will haveto be more than doubled again. This great task will involve not merely recon-version on a great scale, but also the problem of developing markets, as soon asthe shortage of goods prevailing immediately after the war has been overcome.It is for this reason that the British Government feel that complete freedom of export must be resumed immediately, and that any avoidable handicaps inbeginning the task of reorganisation should be removed at the earliest possible date.ANNEX B.Civilian Living Standards.l.-^The General Level.1. The British civilian has had five years of black-out and four years ofintermittent blitz. The privacy of his home has been periodically invaded bysoldiers or evacuees or war-workers requiring billets. In five years of drasticlabour mobilisation, nearly every man and every woman, under 50 without young-children has been.subject to direction to work, often far from home. The hoursof work average 53 for men and 50 overall; when work is done, every citizen whois not excused for reasons of family circumstances, work, &amp;c, has had to do 48hours a month duty in the Home Guard or Civil Defence. Supplies of all kindshave been progressively limited by shipping and man-power shortage; the queueis part of normal life.   Taxation is probably the severest in the world, and is
coupled with continuous pressure to save. The scarce supplies, both of goods and services, must be shared with hundreds of thousands of United States,Dominion and Allied troops; in the preparation of Britain first as the base andtften as the bridgehead, the civilian has inevitably suffered hardships spread overalmost every aspect of his daily life. *2. This is the price of total war, which the British are well satisfied to pay.But the cumulative- effect over a period; of years must necessarily be a severe strain. The blitzes of 1940-41, the flying bomb of 1944, the food difficulties inthe Spring of 1941, the man-power mobilisation step by step from 1940 to 1943,the steady disappearance of manufactured goods from the shops-these are acumulative pressure upon civilian standards which cannot indefinitely bemaintained. It is impossible to measure the pressure precisely; only a part ofit can be measured at all in material elements which make up the civilianstandard of life. This Annex is mainly concerned with the period to the end of1943, but in 1944 the position is not significantly different from that of 1943,some minor increases being more than balanced by contractions elsewhere, andby general pressures arising from the increased Service population.3. -Estimates&apos; of the change in civil consumption are precarious. Thetechnical difficulties of a meaningful comparison are considerable. The wholevalidity is in question when allowance should be, but in fact cannot be, made forthe increased needs of a population in which more people are at work; for thefact that a substantial quantity of consumer goods and services is consumedeither by institutions- N.A.A.F..L, canteens, hospitals, etc. or by British andother soldiers of the United Nations in the United Kingdom; for the very con-siderable wartime changes of quality, which make a railway ticket, a pint of beer, or the rental of a house an essentially different commodity from its peace-time equivalent; for limitations on the freedom of choice through rationing andshortages; for the fact that in a number of fields furniture., clothing, house-hold goods in particular the permitted consumption is in part that of people who need to replace goods destroyed by enemy action. For what it is worth and it is not worth much a straight comparison, corrected for none of these things, shows a real expenditure in 1943 (and 1944 differs little) about 80 percent, of that of 1938.II. Housing.4. The change in housing conditions has been dominated by war damage,by requisition for Services and by billeting, by the drastic reduction of facilitiesfor normal repair and by cessation of house-building (300,000 houses were builtyearly before the war). Some indication of the degree of loss due to war damage is given by the fact that of some 13 million dwellings in the United Kingdom,some 170,000 had been totally destroyed before June 1944, and 80,000 so seriously damaged as to be uninhabitable. In total, there had been 3-4 million casesreported of damage of some kind, some affecting the same house on more thanone occasion. Many houses have not yet received complete repairs; much even of the repair which is &quot; complete &quot; for the time being will later have to be re-done or supplemented. The flying-bomb attacks on London have created new damage which at first outran the rate even of first-aid repair, and special measures hadto be taken to bring building labour into the London area in order to tackle the rapidly growing arrears, even at the expense of essential government&apos; workelsewhere. During these attacks a further 23,000 homes were totally destroyed,and it is estimated, on the basis of the known results of the first stages of the attack that in all, 1,100,000 have been damaged, of which 100,000 are uninhabit-able without extensive repairs.5. In certain areas, entire villages have been requistioned by the militaryauthorities; heavy demands have been made on rural house-room by the Servicesand evacuees, and in the industrial areas of the Midlands and the North by theneed to billet war-workers.6. Normal house-building has been at a standstill since 1940; the labourengaged upon running repairs, painting, &amp;o, for all premises has been reduced from 300,000 in 1938 to 140,000 in 1943 (excluding War Damage repair), andit is estimated that in the three years 1941-43, only eighteen months&apos; normal houserepair was done.7. War conditions increase, domestic requirements of fuel and light. Ina drab life of black-out, dull food; damaged and draughty houses, with the family
feeding at different times because of their various shifts and civil defenceresponsibilities, more fuel is needed for heating, lighting and cooking, and theIopV of it h^s a Hisnrnnnrt,innfi.tfi nsvoholoe-ical effect. Furthermore, the adminis-trative difficulties of controlling fuel consumption are very great; the diversityof household patterns makes actual rationing impracticable; there have, however,been severe restrictions on coal deliveries for household use.III.-Travel?.8. An appropriate measure is the relation of public travel facilities towartime needs. In certain respects more travel is needed than in peacetime.There have been the periodic evacuation waves, and consequent visits by parentsto their children in the country; workers are directed to work further from their homes; others have to move their homes, either because of enemy action or becauseof a new work-place; Servicemen&apos;s wives must visit their husbands; millions of British and Allied soldiers must take leave; there is, in addition, the greatvolume of military passenger movement. On the other hand, holiday facilities are greatly restricted. It is the custom of the British people, none of whomlive more than 80 miles from the sea, to spend their holidays, at the seaside and the whole of the South and East coastal areas have been restricted since 1940from time to time; those holidays which war-workers have been able to securehave been for the most part spent at home, a very real sacrifice not only forthe war-workers themselves, but even more for their wives.9! On balance, there has been an increase since 1938 in the total number of passenger journeys on the British railways by about 10 per cent.; including trooptrains. But the total number of passenger train-miles has fallen by nearly 30 percent. This in itself is an indication of the way in which the railways have been compelled to herd the passengers into the trains; it is said, indeed, that if the passengers were animals, the railway companies would be prosecuted by thehumane societies. In the summer of 1944, as part of the measures to clear therailways for the invasion, there were new and drastic- cuts in long-distancepassenger services,. equivalent to a further reduction in train-mileage of some10 per cent. Furthermore, the almost total disappearance of fast trains,restaurant and sleeping cars has imposed considerable hardships.10. The shortage ^of petrol and tyres and drivers has led to drastic cuts in public service road transport, especially over long distances. Fuel consumptionof vehicles in these services has been cut by about 40 per cent.11. Private motoring has, of course, been cut much more severely. since june 1942, petrol has been available to private motorists only on proof of need; a ration is permitted only to doctors, officials travelling on business and the like.The weekly consumption of petrol by private cars and motor cycles had thus beenreduced from 47,600 tons in 1938 to 6,000 in 1943, or about one-eighth of the pre-war level; if purely personal consumption be considered, excluding professional and business use, the cut is from 513 million gallons in 1938 to 7 - 6 in 1943, or to a comparative level of 1-J per cent. The number of cars licensed has fallen from ,034,000 in August 1939 to 735,000 in May 1944, and the number of motor cyclesfrom 418,000 to 117,000.12. The supply of new bicycles has been reduced by 55 per cent., but theusage of the existing stock has greatly increased, and the supply of tyres ofinferior quality to cyclists has nearly doubled. This is an inevitable result of the curtailment of public transport and the drastic cut in private motoring.IV. Consumer Goods.13. Total Supplies. Supplies of manufactured goods have becomeprogressively scarce. Some, such as clothing and soap, are rationed;. others, suchas furniture, are obtainable only by permit; others tend at intervals to disappearfrom the shops altogether; in some cases (e.g., kitchenware) the supply must thenbe stepped up; others again, such as newspapers, are in reasonably plentifulsupply, but either the buyer gets a much smaller article for the pre-war price orthe product is taxed very heavily. Rationing and price control limit expenditureon necessities, and the great volume of public purchasing power eats up the supplyof uncontrolled goods as it appears, the State taking a rake-off both in purchase tax on such products up to 100 per cent, and by 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax.
14. Change in quality and indeed of the nature of goods supplied to thepublic makes measurement difficult, but the following table shows the estimatedpersonal expenditure on manufactured goods : Changes in the Volume of Expenditure on Consumer Goods.($ million at 1938 prices.)	1938.	1939.	1940.	1941.	1942.	1943.Clothing Household goods ...  -Other goods Total	1,788 1,096 876	1,788 1,040 876	1,500 812 772	1,108 592 632	1,092 416 516	1,036 352 500	3,760	3,704	3,084	2,332	2,024	1,888These expenditures were made by a civilian population some *1\ per cent, smaller than in 1938. But they include all purchases made by members of the British and allied armed forces, i.e., everything which Servicemen in Britain do not receivein kind; they also include all supplies to N.A.A.F.I., canteens, hospitals, ships&apos;stores, &amp;c.   Purchases made to replace blitzed possessions are, of course, included.15. Broadly, puchases of manufactured goods had fallen by one-half in1943; the 1944 supply may not be very different. But the actual level is not thewhole story; supplies have now been very scarce for three years, and as wardrobesand domestic stocks become exhausted, the effects of shortage grow cumulatively.In 1941 it was not difficult to manage with a clothing supply of 60 per cent, of pre-war ; in 1944 the whole order of hardship is different. In the five years of war,assuming 1944 the same as 1943, the population has received only three years&apos;normal &quot;supply of clothing, something over two years&apos; supply of household goods and some 3^ yearn&apos; supply of other goods. This shows a backlog of re-equip-ment, towards restoring some parts of which a beginning must soon be made.16. Clothing. Clothing rationing was introduced in mid-1941, and theaggregate volume of consumption wras, in 1943, about 42 per cent, below pre-war.Boots and shoes, however, fell by only 28 per cent. The following table shows the average numbers of certain garments purchased on the current ration byadults not receiving the industrial supplement. This is expressed as a rateof purchase; as stocks are now pretty constant, this reflects accurately current production possibilities : Overcoats and rainwearOuterwear (i.e., suits; or jackets withodd trousers ; costumes;  dresses;or odd skirts or slacks with jacketor blouse)Shirts    ............      ........Under garments (all kinds, includingcorsets)Socks and stockings   ....Nightwear       ....Footwear (all types, including slippers)Men.(18 and over).1 in 4^ years1 in 2J years1 in 9 months1 in 9 months1 in 5 months1 in 4  years1 in 13 monthsWomen.(18 and over).1 in 2f years.1 in 9 months.1 in 4 months.1 in 2^ months.1 in 4 years.1 in 8 months.The ration in 1944 is 48 points, or 58 for industrial workers, with special allowances for certain types of worker. It is estimated that supplies will haveto increase to permit a ration of at least 100 points a year before it is possibleto stop rationing:17. Household goods. Consumption of household goods furniture, hard-ware, hollow-ware, crockery, soap, electric lamps, &amp;c. had, by 1943, fallenoelow one-third of the 1938 level. These supplies had to meet the demand of hospitals and other institutions, as well as that of personal users; personalsupplies had to cover the losses of existing stocks through enemy action.Many types of goods, especially those of the best quality, are no longer available,and the range of designs from which the consumer can choose is much narrower;
both, these factors tend to make the consumer&apos;s position even worse than itappears from the reduction in total supplies.18. Supplies of furnishings (including furniture, upholstery, carpets,curtains, &amp;c), were, by 1943, only some 20 per cent, of the pre-war level.Curtains, towels, kitchen-cloths, have all to be met within the units of the personal, clothing ration. The production of furniture for private householdsis confined to wooden &apos;&apos; utility &apos;5 models, none of which are upholstered. Thisis issued only to people setting up house, including those who have been bombed,or to parents needing a bed for a growing child. Even then, an allowance toa bombed-out couple, for example, would be exhausted by the purchase of onlyone double bed, one kitchen table, four upright chairs, one dressing chest, onearmshair, one set of book-shelves. Even this scanty allowance is reduced whereapplicants have some furniture; and generally demands cannot be satisfiedwithout considerable delay. Supplies of wool carpets and rugs have been cutto 4 per cent, of the pre-war level, felt base to 16 per cent., linoleum andsubstitutes to 17 per cent., woollen blankets to about 33 per cent. The produc-tion of sheets Would provide only one pair per person in 30 years.19. Supplies of domestic hardware in 1943 were about one-third of pre-war. The manufacture for civilian uses of most electrical household appliances,aluminium hollow-ware and lawn-mowers is, of course, prohibited. Only simpleforms of electric-light fittings are permitted, and refrigerators may be licensedonly on urgent medical grounds. A limited output of cookers (7 per cent, ofthe pre-war level), fires, kettles and irons was permitted in 1943, almost entirelyfor institutions. Production of domestic hollow-ware was reduced too far in1941-42, and it was necessary in 1943 to restore supplies to about one-half thepre-war level; the 1943 supplies, on the assumption that two-thirds of the out-put went to private consumers; were equivalent to one kettle for each householdin 3^ years, one saucepan in If years, and one bucket in 4 years.20. Supplies of table-knives in 1943 were 18 per cent, of pre-war, andof spoons and forks 10 per cent; at this rate, each private citizen could buyone knife, spoon and fork about every 20 years. Other household goods in short supply include china and glassware, household brushes and brooms (40 per cent,of pre-war), and matches (55 per cent, of pre-war).21. In the picture of household goods, the lack of material for repair-work,and the acute shortage of spares and materials is significant. When a householdappliance breaks down, an interval of weeks may elapse before it can be repaired.It is extremely difficult to get supplies of timber and other materials for workabout the house.22. Other goods. The heterogeneous collection of &quot; other goods,&quot; which in1938 represented nearly one-quarter of expenditure on manufactured goods, has followed diverse patterns. Production for civilian use is prohibited over a wide range, including gramophones, pianos, cameras, golf and tennis balls, many types of leather goods, nearly all fancy goods, jewellery (excepting wedding rings) andmany types of toys. Some licences, however, have had to be issued to cover small-scale production by people who were considered unsuitable for transfer to more essential work.23. Among goods of which production is still permitted there have been cuts of varying degrees. Eor example, supplies of lead pencils are 70 per cent, of pre-war, razor blades 62 per cent., gramophone records (mainly for institutions)55 per cent., toothbrushes 54 per cent., shaving brushes 24 per cent., penknives23 per cent., fountain pens 21 per cent., umbrellas 10 per cent. The 1943 supplyof radio valves for replacements for a radio population of 9-6 million sets was-Jr million.24. Clocks and watches were nearly all imported from Europe before thewar, and supplies for civilians have been almost negligible for some years. Theshortage of alarm clocks was so serious that supplies had to be imported underLend-Lease, being released at first only against permits issued to people on essential work who regularly had to rise before 5 a.m.25. Expenditure on books, magazines and newspapers has increased; theannual number of newspapers bought per adult civilian has risen from 180 to 208,
V. Drink and Tobacco.26. The same tendency is very marked in the purchases of drink and tobacco. These are the anodynes against the stress and boredom of war, and thevolume of consumption has increased by some 7 per cent, despite increases in taxation, which have raised the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes from the pre-war Is. (20 cents) to 2s. 4:d. (47 cents), and the price of a pint of beer, depreciatedin quality, from 8d. (13 cents) to Is. 2d. (23 cents). Expressed on the appropriateper head basis, the consumption of alcoholic liquor (adult civilians plus all armed forces in the United Kingdom) expanded by 7 per cent., and that of tobacco (adultcivilians plus British armed forces in the United Kingdom) by 17 per cent. Sopowerful is the pressure of purchasing power into unrationed channels, even ofdepreciated quality, that in 1943 expenditure on drink and tobacco exceeded$4,000 million only slightly less than that on food and it yields theExchequer a revenue of $2,828 million, a sum not far short of the total pre-warrevenue of the State.VI.-Food*27, The food supply in the last five years has been enough but only justenough -to sustain health and strength on a monotonous diet. The FifteenthReport to Congress on Lend-Lease Operations describes the present position &quot; Even with the help of Lend-Lease goods, however, this result to have enough to eat to sustain an intensive war effort has been attained only byvery strict rationing. The British people eat far less well than the people ofthe United States. Compared to the average American civilian, the averageBritisher in 1943 was able to obtain only 76 per cent, as much milk and milk products, 76 per cent, as much meat, 68 per cent, as much poultry and fish,56 per cent, as many eggs (and in Britain&apos;s case these were almost entirelydried eggs), 23 per cent, as much citrus fruit and tomatoes, and 50 per cent,as much other fruit and fruit products. The only important foods theBritish civilian gets more of than the American civilian are potatoes, suchvegetables as carrots and cabbage, and bread.&quot;28. At the period of greatest shortage in the first half of 1941 caloriesupplies fell to 90 per cent, of the pre-war level, animal protein to 77 per cent.,and fat to 81 per cent., and there were indications that the diet was inadequate.Since then, so far as bulk and nutriments are concerned, supplies have been main-tained at an adequate level, thanks to Lend-Lease shipments from the UnitedStates and Mutual Aid shipments from Canada. The average calorie intakein 1943 was only 5 per cent, lower than before the war, and total protein supplies were a little greater, although, of course, the proportion of animal protein had declined. Supplies of vitamins and minerals have been well maintained, largelythrough the increase in the extraction ratio of flour, the addition of calciumto the flour, the fortification of margarine with vitamins and the increased supplies of vegetables and milk.29. But the nutritional adequacy of the British diet has been maintainedonly at the expense of a marked change in its composition. This is illustrated by the following table, which shows the changes forced upon us by the war in* Most of the material in this section is taken from the &quot;Combined Food Board&apos;s study of Food Consumption Levels in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.but the number of magazines has fallen from 28 to 26; the number of books soldis probably not much less than 85 per cent, of pre-war, but the maintenance of sales has been possible only by the virtual exhaustion of pre-war stocks. The size of these publications has been drastically cut; the daily newspaper has 4 pages,sometimes rising to 6, and the consumption of newsprint is less than one-quarterof the pre-war level; likewise, the book trade has been maintained on a 43 per cent,paper allocation.

While it refers to 1943, preliminary esti-mates for 1944 do not appreciably differ.British Civilian Food Consumption.Change in consumption     Consumptionper head between 1934-38      per headand 1943. in 1943.Per cent. lbs.Fruit............             -46 75Sugars and Syrups......             - 31 65Meat, poultry, game, fish, and eggs        .........             -22 149Oils and fats, including butter             -16 38Beverages (tea, coffee, cocoa)...             - 9 12Milk    and   milk    products,excluding butter          ...             -f 28 49 (a)Grains, potatoes, pulses     ...             -f-28 509Vegetables     ...&quot;     ......            ^33 197(a) in milk solids.Supplies of meat, fish, eggs, butter, fats, sugar and fruit have been greatly reduced, and the British consumer has been forced to make up the deficiencyby eating more potatoes, vegetables and bread. Before the war only 51 per cent,of the weight of food consumed by the British public consisted of grains, potatoes,pulses and vegetables; this proportion has risen to 65 per cent. There has alsobeen an increase in milk consumption, but this has gone to priority classes, suchas children and expectant mothers; and supplies to the normal adult consumerhave been severely restricted.31. The overall adequacy of the country&apos;s food supplies in terms of nutrientshas been proved by experience. What cannot be stated in statistics of vitaminsand calories are the loss of variety and palatability, the disappearance of familiardishes, the house-wife&apos;s struggle to provide a main dish each day, the substitu-tion of mass-feeding in canteens for domestic meals.32. Meat and bacon, butter, margarine and cooking fats, cheese, tea, sugar and preserves are rationed; distribution of eggs and milk is controlled to ensurepreferential supplies to priority classes of consumers; tinned goods and many other foods (e,g., dried fruit, breakfast cereals, rice, biscuits, &amp;c.) are rationedon a points system; chocolate and sugar confectionery are on a separate personalpoints system; fish, though not rationed, is scarce. Bread and potatoes and mostvegetables are the only major foodstuffs in unrestricted supply. The rationsare meagre when considered by themselves : a week&apos;s ration of meat (Is. 2d. worth of beef, veal, mutton, lamb or pork) could well disappear in a single pre-warsteak but is-supplemented by ration-free offals, when procurable : a week&apos;s ration of bacon (4oz.) would not leave much over from a good pre-war breakfast; in winter the supply of eggs shrinks to one a month; and so on. To a limited extentrations are supplemented by &quot; eating out &quot; in canteens and restaurants. It hasbeen the policy of the Ministry of Food to give priority supplies to industrialcanteens. School children, mothers and young children have also hadpreferential treatment. The people who suffer most are those who are confined to their house by age or infirmity; the sick and convalescent whose appetitesneed to be stimulated.33. Rationing has secured a more even distribution of essential foods overall income groups. But to ensure that all can obtain their share of the rationed foods prices have been strictly controlled. This has only been possible by meansof subsidies, which impose a heavy burden on the Exchequer. Rationing however,has its own peculiar drawbacks and vexations for the customer, and for the traderit imposes additional work upon depleted staffs; we cannot hope to be rid of thesevexations for some time to come.
VII. Services.34. There has, of course, been a vast contraction of man-power in the serviceoccupations. This, indeed, is a major deprivation of which every middle-classEnglishman is conscious at every turn. Employment in the distributive tradeshas fallen by about one-third; employment in miscellaneous services, such ashotels and restaurants and entertainment and laundries has fallen by about one-quarter, the number of people engaged in private domestic service has beenreduced from about 1,400,000 to less than 400,000; only an insignificant fraction of those between 18 and 60 years of age is allowed, on grounds of hardship/toremain in such employment. At the same time there has been the inevitable flow of surplus purchasing power into this field; expenditure on entertainments at constant prices has increased by some 16 per cent., and the Exchequer receipts from the entertainment tax have risen from $32 million a year to $160 million ayear. Here, even more than in the supplies of actual goods, the public has felt the impact of demands of the armed forces upon the very limited accommodation available.35. The result &quot;is, of course, that the standards of amenities and generalservices available have deteriorated enormously. The cut in the distributive trades has not been more severe than that in the quantity of goods to be supplied to consumers, but it has meant a disproportionate diminution of service the closure of tens of thousands of small shops, considerable effective restriction upon- choice of retailer and the disappearance of all customary amenities such asdomestic delivery. There are the same number of families to be supplied, althoughwith less&apos; goods, and about two-thirds as many people to supply them, at the sametime as the machinery of rationing imposes more work upon them. In the hotel sand restaurants, places of entertainment and the like, the demand for services is out of all relation with the supply. Laundries cannot take more customers andhave a slow service, doubly difficult when wardrobes and linen cupboards are running low. The medical men who are still practising at home are pressed harderthan before, and in some districts are definitely insufficient there are now only some 31,700 in civilian practice as compared with before the war. The postalauthorities cannot maintain their pre-war service, as they must cope with increased traffic with depleted staff. Repair work of all sorts (cars, bicycles,clocks, watches, &amp;c.) has become difficult.36. These are generally losses of convenience rather than of necessities, butthey all serve to increase the burden upon the ordinary civilian, who has more work to do, more duties to perform, less food to eat, less supplies of all kinds,and the possibility of being bombed out as well. They press more heavily stillupon the women of the community, trying to run their homes and their jobs atonce, and forced at the same time to endure hours of waiting and queueing andworry of all kinds which the service occupations are designed to save. Theshortage of goods is tremendously more important than the loss of serviceamenities; but the lack accentuates the drabness and difficulty which is the centralfeature of the ordinary citizen&apos;s life at the beginning of the sixth year of the war.
ANNEX C.The British Man-Power Problem in Stage II.I. -Tlie Distribution of Man-Power.1. At mid-1944 there were in employment in Great Britain about 22,015,000men and women of normal working age, as compared with about 18,480,000 in1939. Their distribution between various industries and services .at these datesis compared in the Table below and the present estimates of needs in Stage II arealso shown: -Distribution of Man-Power in Great Britain.(000&apos;s)    -Proposals for First year of Stage II.Average formidable-1939      Mid-1944.

Unemployedare excluded except in the estimated total available at the end of thefirst year.  Private domestic servants are excluded throughout.(6) The figures for Stage II are based on the estimates of requirements under each head put forward by the responsible Departments. These havebeen adjusted in the cases of the Services and Munitions to take account of the Quebec decisions.(c) The figures of 1,150,000 and 200,000 for munitions in 1939 represent a substantially greater volume of munitions production than, in an ordinary peace-time year.id) &apos;( Other Manufactures &apos;&apos; include textiles, clothing, leather, wood-working,paper, printing, bricks, pottery, glass, &amp;c. &apos;&apos; Non-Manufactures &apos;&apos;include commerce, banking, insurance, finance, professional services,hotels, restaurants, laundries, entertainment, &amp;c.2. The figures in the above Table call for certain comment. First, inmeasuring the extent to which it may be possible to find the man-power to achieveour objectives, allowance must be made for the difficulties of transferring workers.At mid-1939 there were 1,345,000 unemployed; at mid-1944 the figure was nohigher than 102,000. There is no possibility that we can negotiate all thedifficulties of the Stage &apos; II transitions without some substantial increase in umemployment, at least for a time.  If the figure were no more than 500,000 (about
2-1 per cent.), the gap between the present target figures of numbers required tobe employed under each head at the end of the first year and the probable totalof man-power in employment would be of the order of 800,000-, a large part ofwhich would probably fall upon the planned increase in the Home Market andGeneral Services.3-. Second, the targets for the end of the first year of Stage II and theestimates for the average of that year broadly represent what we would wish to achieve. On the other hand, the British Government exercises only limited powers over the employment of a large proportion of its citizens. It will no longer bepossible .to direct older women, or women with household responsibilities;- thosewho have been working away from home for&apos; three years or more must be allowedto return if they wish. It is not proposed to exercise powers of direction over themen who are demobilised from the Forces, save where they are released on urgentindustrial grounds rather than age and length of service. Many of the men released will have rights of reinstatement in industries which are, for immediatepurposes, less essential.4. Thus in Stage II the British Government will have only limited powersto make the man-power pattern conform to its own intentions. It may be unableto prevent a rise in distribution of non-manufactures, to- a higher level than itwould wish. The present estimates for those categories represent the minimumfigures to which it may prove possible to hold them; they may be proved by eventsto be under-estimates.5&quot;. Third, the above figures do. not show the full volume of employment on government or. Export work,, or, in. consequence, the full measure of the war-timechanges in those, serving the Home Market,. The whole of mining, transport,public utilities, commerce and-other general services, are shown under the head ofHome Market and General Services, even when they are, in fact,, ancillary toGovernment or Export Work.6- We have estimated the division of the employed manrpower between government Work, Export and the Home Market, after assigning to each of thelatter&apos;its approximate share in these general, services; the result is as follows : Division of Man-power between Government, Home and Export (/Great. Britain).1939.		1940.	1941.	1942i	1943.	1944.	Estimates rstYear, Stage II.								Average of Year.

The same, calculation would show, at mid-1944&apos;, about 15,000,000 employedon Government work, including the Armed Forces.

II. Expected Man-power Supplies, in Stage II.8. The available man-power will decline in Stage II for two reasons. First,there is already a decline in the total number of&quot; men -available as the result of casulties, and of women workers in industry, through industrial wastage. Inthe second half of 1944, for those reasons, the total available man-power is likelyto decline by about 294,000. Secondly, in the first year of Stage II this Ordinaryprocess of decline will be increased still further through the withdrawal of married women and others who cannot be directed to work and who have onlyentered industry as a war measure. At mid-1944 there were nearly 50 per cent,more women at work than at mid-1939; the number of married women aged 41-59in industry has increased from 400,000 to over 1,000,000; of all single womenaged 18-40 as many as 90 per cent, are in industry or the Services, and of marriedwomen aged 18-40 without young children as many as 80 per cent. In all thereare now 2,600,000 married women in industry as compared with little over1,000,000 in 1939. These very high figures cannot be maintained once theimmediate danger is past. The net losses from all causes in 1945 are estimatedat 1,280,000, even with the maintenance of the present schoOl-ieavIng age. after taking account of all these factors, the total available man-power, employed andunemployed, at the end of the first year of Stage II, is not expected to exceed20,544,000. &apos;  &quot;III.-Eccpec.ted Man-power Requirements in Stage II.9. The Military Needs of Stage II: (i) Forces. The strengths of the three services to be sustained from recruitment in Great Britain at mid-1944, andas now estimated for the end of the first year of Stage II on the basis of theQuebec decisions, are as follows : Strengths of the Services.(Men and Women.)End of First YearMid-19 U- of Stage II.853,500 670,000.......      2,918,000 1,514,000.......      1,177,400 666,000...      ...          19,300 (a)NavyArmy    ...R.A.F.......Nursing Services4,968,200(a) Included in totals above.2,850,00010. These figures represent the provisional estimates of the British Chiefsof Staff of the minimum forces necessary to discharge the tasks laid upon them.11. The Military Needs of Stage II: (ii) Munitions. The sources ofBritish Empire munitions supplies at various stages during the war are estimated to have been as follows : Sources of British Empire Munitions Supplies.	1939 (Sept.-, Dec).	1940.	1941. i	1942 Per cent.	1943.	1944   1 (Jam-June).

While the proportion of British Empire munitions supplies produced in UnitedKingdom -fell from 95 per cent, in 1939 to 60 per cent, in the first half of 1944, theman-power employed in United Kingdom on such production in the same period was nearly quadrupled.12. The numbers in the Forces will fall progressively, and on the averageof the first year of Stage II over 80 per cent, of the present Forces of the BritishEmpire are likely to need to be maintained.  It is estimated that this will require
a total volume of munitions production for the British Empire, after allowing for use of stocks, of about 62 per cent, of the 1944 level. If the British Empirehad to provide the whole of this without external assistance, there could be littlerelaxation in their scale of munitions production.13. At mid-1944 the man-power in the munitions industries (iron and steel,engineering, chemicals and shipbuilding) employed on work for the three supply departments was as follows : &apos;Man-power in Munitions Industries at Mid-1944.Admiralty......      ...      ...      ......        950,000Ministry of Supply......       .........      1,493,000Ministry of Aircraft Production .........      1,832,0004,275,00014.   The British production programmes are estimated to require thefollowing numbers of workers in the first year of Stage II : -*Estimated Man-power in Munitions Industries in First Year of Stage II.Estimated A verdge End- year of Year.- Target.Admiralty......       ... 850,000 800,000Ministry of Supply      ...... 960,000 693,000Ministry of Aircraft Production      1,230,000 830,0003,040,000 2,323,00015&apos;. The British man-power on munitions is thus expected to fall by theend of the first year to about 55 per cent, of its present level. The averageemployment on munitions in 1945 will, however, greatly exceed the end-yearfigure, and may be estimated at 3,040,000. The output of this labour force,allowing for all considerations, including a reduction from the present working week of &quot;53 to 54 hours to the normal level of 47 to 48 hours, may be put at about66 per cent, of the pi-esent level.16. The Needs for Export. We have set ourselves the long-term target of raising our exports from their present level of about 30 per cent, of pre-war to 150 per cent, of that level. The immediate programme aims at raising thenumbers engaged directly in export from the present 300,000 to about 1,150,000by the end of the first year of Stage II.17. Over-all that represents a return to a little under 90 per cent, ofthe 1939 man-power. This does not, however, mean that in the first year of stage II we should be able to export 90 per cent, of our 1939 exports. It hasbeen estimated that the planned labour force on export will raise the productionof exports from their present level of around 30 per cent, of the pre-war volumeto about 60 per cent, during the first year of Stage II. There is reason to thinkthat this estimate allows too little for the difficulties of transferring labour, of re-converting or re-opening capacity, of obtaining orders and preparing designs.18. Morevover, the increase cannot be evenly spread over the whole field,since the use of capacity to meet Japanese war needs, or more immediate problemsof recruitment and training of the labour forces, present obstacles that cannot in all cases be overcome. The immediate increase is likely to be greatest in those industries whose type of product and level of output has not been substantiallychanged by the war. It will be less in those where plants have been closed downand labour forces dissipated. The increase of export in the first year will be relatively slight in coal-mining, where the labour force has considerably fallenduring the war.19. The Needs for Building. The extent of the war damage to housingvvhich requires to be made good has been indicated in Annex B. Apart from enemy destruction, the war has brought a complete cessation of all normal house-building since 1940; about .300,000 houses were built annually before the war.In addition, over the past three years, there has been barely half the normalrepairs to houses.
20. The present building plans provide for the completion during the first two years after the war of 200,000 permanent houses and 150,000 temporary houses. Well under 100,000 houses of all sorts will be completed during the first,year.  Such a figure would not replace half the houses destroyed by enemy action.21. The present man-power plans provide for an increase of the total labour force to be employed in building and civil engineering, from the 623,000 at whichit stands at mid-1944 to 1,100,000 at the end of the first year of Stage II. this figure compares with 1,310,000 in employment in these trades at mid-1939, apartfrom the substantial reserve of unemployed building labour which then existedWithin this total, there will be a great increase of employment on civil house-building and repairs, and a substantial reduction in military construction. Sucha provision is the absolute minimum that could be contemplated.22. The Needs to make good Arrears of Maintenance. The need to make good the war deficiencies of industrial and public utility maintenance is urgent.Since 1940, maintenance on normal standards has been impossible, and four yearsof increasing arrears has left both industry and public utilities with much ofits plant in a condition in which continued working depends on a substantially greater allocation of man-power to provide for proper overhaul and repair.23. The problem does not lend itself to over-all statistical measurement.It is very roughly estimated by the Departments concerned that maintenanceduring the war has been at between one-quarter and one-half of the normal peace-time rate. A few illustrations will better indicate its importance, and the steadyaccumulation of arrears.24. The engineering industry has been relatively well placed, and theposition will be eased by the new capacity created. On the other hand, verylittle repair and maintenance have been done in iron and steel, in the chemical industries, and in all the textile industries. In all of these the position is nowserious and maintenance cannot be much further postponed.25. From 1939 to the end of 1943, the railways have set aside about 450 million to cover normal depreciation; of this they have actually been ableto spend only  350 million, and the difference of about  100 million broadlymeasures the shortfall in maintenance. As a result they have been able during thewar years to renew an average of only about 980 miles of track annually as against an average of 1,400 miles for the four years before the war. There are now15T per cent, of all locomotives not available because of need for repair; thereare 8 - 2 per cent, of all railway-owned wagons under or awaiting repair abouttwice the normal peace-time programme.26. The condition of buses and other road-haulage vehicles has deterioratedsadly. Despite an allocation of about 2,000 vehicles a month for civilian use, themaintenance of minimum essential services is difficult, and, through shortage of repair staff, the present state of most of the vehicles is lamentable.27. The demands for electricity have increased greatly, and there has been an increase from an average of 2,031 million k.w.h. per month in 1938 to3,267 million k.w.h. per month in the first half of 1944. This increase of over60 per cent, has been met with no more than a 33 per cent, increase of capacityMoreover, because trie new demands are far more continuous than peace-timedemands, it has been difficult to find the usual opportunity, during the summer months, for the urgently necessary overhauls. Partly as a result of this, partly because an increasing proportion of all capacity is now overdue for renewal, thereis currently some 17 per cent, of all capacity Out of commission through break-down, as compared with a figure of about 5 per cent, in the pre-war years.28. No specific man-power allocation has been made for the increase ofmaintenance and renewals of plant. But the present Departmental estimatesinclude a provision for an increase of the labour force in iron and steel,engineering, chemicals and shipbuilding serving the home market by about1 million. This would raise the average number employed during the first yearto a level only about two-thirds of that of 1939.29. The Needs to raise Civil Standards. /The effects of the war on civilian consumption have been outlined in Annex B. The target which we have permittedourselves in Stage II is that of restoring production in the general field of civilian consumption goods to a level about half-way between that of 1938 and that whichprevails in 1944. Having regard to the long time that Britain has been at war,and the state to which most households and wardrobes have now been reduced, we
believe that to be a reasonable objective. Over the past five years British men andwomen have been able to buy only three years&apos; normal supply of clothing and twoyeafs&apos; supply of household goods. The Departmental estimates have made provision for increasing the group of &apos;&apos; other manufactures &apos;&apos; for the civil market(textiles, clothing, leather, wood, paper, pottery, glass, &amp;c.) from the figure of1,024,000 at which it now stands to 1,682,000.30. Even so, the supplies of these goods actually available for consumptionwill not in the first year of Stage II rise from the present level of around 45 percent, of 1938 to the level of about 75 per cent, that the man-power can ultimately 1produce. Plant will only by degrees be released and reconverted. Labour will only progressively become available. When both are available, production muststart from the beginning and work in progress be gradually built up. We shallbe fortunate .if, during the first year, the volume of consumption goods cominginto the hands of retailers carries us one-quarter of the way back to 1938. Andthe retailers themselves will have to restock their denuded shelves. The effectiverise in consumers&apos; standards cannot be great or rapid.31. In the remainder of the field covered by civilian final consumption partof the rise of standards will be the automatic result of reduced Governmentdemands; this particularly affects railway and other transport, public utilityservices, coal supplies and (through reduced demands of Allied Forces) a largevariety of services. Part will come from an increase in the supply of consumptiongoods, as well as capital goods, produced by the engineering and chemical industries. Part will result from expected increases in the man-power in distri-bution and &quot; non-manufactures.&quot; In those two categories, however, the targetincreases have been kept to a minimum in order to enable man-power to be usedto the greatest possible extent on more vital needs.32. Taking the whole field of the Home Market, the man-power, afterexcluding workers performing general services ancillary to Government produc-tion and export, is now about 55 per cent, of 1939 and provision is being made toincrease it to a little over 80 per cent, by the end of the first year of Stage II. Butthe civil home market sector will have to bear a substantial part of the deficiency in the total man-power available to meet all needs, and it is, for that reason,unlikely that these targets will be achieved in full.Summary.In very broad outline, the planned changes between mid-1944 and the endof the first year of Stage II are indicated by the following balance sheet ofexpected increases and decreases in different categories : I. Additional Man-power Demands.Millions ofWorkers.(i) Exports. To raise man-power directly on exports fromthe present level of less than 25 per cent, of pre-war toabout 90 per cent, of pre-war by the end of the first year - 9(ii) Building. To start programme of 200,000 permanent houses and 150,000 temporary houses in two years      ... - 5(iii) Industrial  Maintenance.

To raise man-power on consumersgoods from 50 per cent, of pre-war to 75 per cent, by endof first year, and output over year by about half that:(remainder of engineering, &amp;c, and whole of &quot;othermanufactures&quot; for Home Market)      ...      ...      ... -9(v) Miscellaneous. To cover minimum additions to public utilities, mining, distributive trades, services, profes-sions, &amp;c.     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... -4Total of Additional Demands    ...      ...      ...        3-4
