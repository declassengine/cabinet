THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet. ^October 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 596.26th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.GOVERNMENT BUILDING PROGRAMME:   PROPOSED LABOURALLOCATIONS, OCTOBER TO DECEMBER 1944.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.In my paper W.P. (44) 411, dated the 25th July, 1944, it was explained that,in view of the conditions prevailing at that time, it was not considered realisticto attempt an allocation of labour to Departments. The chief reasons influencingthis decision were that the flying-bomb attacks were at their height, and the&quot; Phoenix &quot; programme had seriously interfered with the ordinary government building Programme. The Departments were permitted to proceed with their programmes without definite ceiling, but subject to a very close scrutiny of allworks, and subject to a considerable withdrawal of labour from all departments which was carried out by agreement in July and August in order to supplementlabour forces in London. At the same time it was laid down that no works shouldbe permitted in the London area except where they were urgently needed for operations or were of equal priority with first-aid repairs.2. It is obviously not practicable for Departments to continue on these linesfor more than a comparatively short period, and I consider that it is now desirableto make an allocation of labour to cover the rest of the year. In framing thisallocation I have been guided by the following considerations : &apos; (a) The very large amount of labour which has still to be found for Londonair raid damage repairs and the consequent War Cabinet decision(WM. (44) 126th Conclusions, Minute 4 (5)) that for six months nobuilding work should be permitted in the London area other than war damage repairs and the remedying of urgent sanitary and structuraldefects.(6) The War Cabinefs decision (W.M. (44) 126th Conclusions, Minute 4 (6))that a lower standard of maintenance should be accepted over the next six months.(c) The War Cabinet assumptions about the ending of Stage I (WM. (44)138th Conclusions, Minute 2).3. It should be borne in mind that owing to the direction of mobile labour to London, labour for works in certain localities outside the London area willnot always be available. Consequently I propose that outside the London areaDepartments should, put forward to the Ministry of Works only their more urgent projects, and where these raise special difficulties, the Minister of works will refer them to me for decision after consultation with the department concerned. In W.P. (44) 411 I drew attention to the importance of earlyreference to the Regional Boards of all new production projects costing morethan  5,000.   I consider it important that this practice should continue.4.- I am interpreting the War Cabinet decision referred to in para-graph 2 (a) above as meaning that building work (other than war damage repairs and the remedying of urgent sanitary and structural defects) shall only be permitted in the London area where it is of operational or equivalent importance.Departments wishing to undertake schemes of this latter character should apply[28475]
to the Minister of Works in the ordinary way, who will refer to me for decisionany case in which he is in doubt.* 5.

These allocations are made on the basis that the total labour force engaged on first-aid repairs to houses and other buildings in London by the end of November will be approximately 132,000. To effect this the following reductions have been made in the Govern-ment building programme allocation: October, 27,000; November, 34,000; December, 41,000.
