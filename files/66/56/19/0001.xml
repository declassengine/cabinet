naval SITUATION.General Review.1. H.M. ships, coastal craft and naval aircraft have successfully attacked enemy shipping and communications in the Eastern Mediterranean.U.S. carrier-borne aircraft have made a heavy attack on the Ryuku Islands.Northern Waters.2. On the 4th. the U.S.S. Eastwind (icebreaker) landed a force on LilleKoldewey Island (N.E. Greenland) and captured the German meteorologicalstation.  Twelve prisoners and much wireless and scientific equipment were taken.H.M.S. Jamaica (cruiser) escorted by FI.M. destroyers Orwell and Obedienthas landed supplies and reliefs for the Norwegian garrison at Spitzbergen.Home and Norwegian Waters.3. Between the 6th and the 8th, Norwegian M.T.Bs. 712 and 722 sank a 350-ton&apos;coaster by gunfire off the Norwegian coast.On the night of the 8th/9th, M.T.Bs. sank an armed trawler off Scheveningenand probably sank a minesweeper off the Texel. Two nights later M.T.Bs.attacked a convoy escorted by four armed trawlers off the Hook of Holland; onetrawler was sunk and another damaged.4. The gale on the 6th and 7th held up work on the blockships at Ostendand caused all sailings to Cherbourg to be cancelled. At Arromanches considerable damage was done to the artificial breakwaters.Though the entrance to Nieuport harbour is blocked and the quays havebeen seriously damaged, it is estimated that when the blockships have been removed.400 tons could be discharged daily. Six berths for medium-sized ships were to be available on the 12th at Rouen.Mediterranean.5. In the Western Mediterranean the U.S. destroyers Niblack and Plunketshelled shipping and gun emplacements near San Remo on the 4th, and on thenext day the Nihlack shelled a railway yard in the same area. On the 7th, theFrench cruiser Emile Bertin- and the U.S. destroyer Eberle shelled the harbourof Maurizio and hit a cargo ship and some small craft. On the 9th and 10thU.S. destroyers Gleaves and Jouett shelled bridges near the Italian-french frontier.6. In the Adriatic on the night of 7th/8th coastal forces sank twoschooners and damaged others off the mouth of the Po. Further south on the5th, landing craft shelled enemy positions at Delvino, 10 miles inland fromwhere the recent Allied landings were made in southern Albania. H.M.destroyer Wilton shelled an enemy battery on the island of Corfu on the 4th.On the 9th. H.M. destroyers Belvoir and Wilton, with landing craft, supported the troops ashore by engaging enemy guns. Some enemy coastal craft were captured in this area during the week.The harbour at Patras is reported to be largely intact owing to the failureof demolition charges.7. In the iEgean H.M.S. Colombo (cruiser) bombarded Heraklion on the night of the 3rd/4th, and the next clay H.M.S. Royalist (cruiser) bombarded Miloand damaged a coaster in the harbour.On the 5th after a bombardment of Levitha by H.M. ships Aurora (cruiser)and Catterick (destroyer) the garrison on the island surrendered to a landingparty which had been sent ashore. On the 7th, H.M. destroyer Termagant sank a destroyer, an- armed trawler and a caique in the Gulf of Salonika, and to the southward H.M. ships Black Prince (cruiser) and Terpsichore (destroyer) sank a. 1,000-ton passenger ship, a caique and a landing craft.On the 9th. naval aircraft from H.M.S. Hunter (escort carrier) blew up twotrains at Salonika, sank a Siebel ferry and damaged another off the Cassandrapeninsula and damaged a torpedo boat and barge at Lemnos. Next day theyattacked the harbour of Syra and Port Laid (Leros), and sank six caiques in the harbour at Kos. Other carrier-borne aircraft sank a small transport betweenEubcea and Attica.   On the 11th, naval aircraft blew up an ammunition train.
Coastal forces, operating from Poros, sank two small craft in the Gulf ofAthens on the night of the 7th/8th and set a small tanker on fire in the same area on the following night. On the 8th they sank a cargo ship and damaged a 400-ton lighter off Psara.8. In the Dodecanese H.M. destroyers Calpe and Cleveland sank six largeassault craft off Piscopi on the night of the 3rd/4th and on the 5th Calpe shelleda battery on Rhodes. On the 6th H.M. destroyer Farndale was damaged by shore batteries while examining Livadia Bay on the east coast of Piscopi.Bast Indies.9. H.M. submarines operating in the Malacca Strait, off Sumatra and in the bay of Bengal have reported as follows : Tradeivind on the 16th September sank two schooners off Indrapura Point (west coast of Sumatra) and on the 18th sank a5.000-ton ship in the same area. On the 19th, Trenchant sank two junks in theMalacca Strait and destroyed a bridge at Peudada (N. Sumatra). On the 27th,Thorough seriously damaged a 350-ton coaster by gunfire in the Malacca Strait.On the 30th, Stratagem destroyed an air observation post at Pord Bay, Great CocoIsland (north of the Andamans).Pacific.10. On the 23rd September U.S. forces took possession of the main atolls ofthe Ulithi group (N.E. of Yap Island). No enemy forces were encountered.Ulithi lagoon is suitable as a fleet anchorage.11. Carrier-borne aircraft of the U.S. fleet have made a heavy attack on shipping at the Ryuku Islands (east of Formosa). It is reported that the enemy was completely surprised, that 98 Japanese aircraft were destroyed, that over 20ships, including a destroyer, a minesweeper and a U-boat, were sunk or damaged and many defence intallations were set on fireAnti-Submarine Operations.12. Eleven attacks were reported during the week, five of them by warships,three by carrier-borne aircraft and three by shore-based aircraft None of these attacks was promising.Enemy Intelligence.13. The Emden is reported to be employed on mining operations in theSkaggerak.U-boats.14. One, possibly three U-boats, are operating off the coast of Nova Scotiaand in the Gulf of St. Lawrence : otherwise activity is on a much reduced scale.A large U-boat assembly shelter and possibly a covered operational base are in process of intensive construction on a large scale near Farge, on the right bankof the Weser below Vegesack.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15. During the week a U.S. ship was damaged by a mine off Toulon and wastowed into port.16. Shipping losses by enemy action during September amounted to sevenships of 43,368 tons, all of which were sunk by U-boats. Marine casualtiesamounted to 17 ships of 30,471 tons, making the total of losses from all causes to24 ships of 73,839 tons.Three ships were sunk by U-boats off the N.W. coast of Ireland (R), two in convoy from North Russia, one in the Indian Ocean east of Mombasa and onesouth of Newfoundland.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During September 16 convoys of 632 ships arrived in the UnitedKingdom without loss by enemy action and one convoy originally of 99 ships lost[28384] b
two before arrival. In addition, two ships were sunk during the month in a convoy from N. Russia which was still at sea at the end of the month. Sixteenoutward-bound convoys of 720 ships arrived at their destinations without lossby enemy action and one convoy, originally of 140 ships, lost one before arrival.The total number of ships convoyed in September (including coastal but excludingoperational convoys) was 5,117 in 346 convoys, of which three ships were lost by enemy action.Allied Minelaying.18.   Surface craft have laid mines off the south-west coast of Ireland (R).Aircraft have laid mines in the Kiel Canal, in the Heligoland Bight and oft&apos;the Dutch Coast.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.19.   There have been no reports of minelaying in Home Waters.Channels to Boulogne have been established from the Downs and from south-east of Hastings.  A Dover-Calais channel was established on the 10th.Sweeping of the Seine has so far proved negative. Seven mines have been destroyed off Ostend, six off Calais, five off Sangatte and seven off Boulogne.Eight mines have been destroyed in the Havre area where weather has preventedsweeping on three days of the week. H.M.C.S. Mulgrave (minesweeper) was damaged by a ground mine off the Seine bank on the 8th and was towed intoHavre and beached.   Four mines were destroyed off Brest.20. During recent sweeping off the Dalmatian Islands, 99 mines were destroyed.A channel is being cleared between Amorgos and Kinaros in the centralJEgeah.The mine totals are :  5,735 ground and 6,112 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. Several reports have been received of German-controlled tankers loadingfuel in Norwegian ports and afterwards sailing southwards. The Germans are reported to have shipped from Oslo 14,000 tons of ordinary motor spirit collected from tanks in Oslo and surrounding districts. In addition, three tankers are reported to have carried about 7,000 tons of aviation spirit from North Norwayto Germany.- These reported movements of oil by tanker were preceded by other reportsof the transport of oil within the country which suggested that stocks werebeing concentrated in the ports. It now seems clear that these collected stocks are in part being shipped back to Germany.Judging by observed tanker movements to central and northern Norway,deliveries of naval fuels, including diesel oil, are being maintained at much thesame level as in the spring. The proportion of diesel fuel has presumably been increased to meet the needs of the augmented U-boat fleet which is now operating from Norwegian bases.22. The German ship Hartmui (5,000 tons) was mined and sunk on the30th September in the Kattegat.  She was originally the Norwegian ship Mostum.Seven enemy or enemy-controlled ships of about 9,932 tons have recentlybeen sunk by British mines in the Baltic, Kattegat and North Sea, and five ofabout 6,261 tons have been damaged.23. The German transports Mar Del Plata (7,300 tons) and Monte Rosa(14,000 tons) are reported to have left the Eastern Baltic for duties in norwegian and Danish waters.Russian Intelligence.24. The port of Odessa is now able to receive and discharge three10,000-ton ships. At Sebastopol ships can now discharge on to the beach butthe rail-road tunnel is still obstructed and it may be two months before it canbe cleared.
MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.25. Successful development of the U.S. thrust on Aachen and the launching of an attack by the Hnd Canadian Corps on the enemy stronghold along the South Bank of the Scheldt estuary have been the two main events of an otherwise quietweek. The attack on Aachen has resulted in the virtual isolation of the town.Progress by the Canadians across the Leopold Canal has been slow and muchhampered by strong enemy defences, minefields and the marshy nature of thearound. An amphibious assault, however, which was successfully launched onthe 9th has secured a bridgehead in rear of the enemy and should materially assist in the reduction of this area.Southern Group of Armies.26. Fighting has been severe in this sector and French forces have made little progress on the right flank. Further north, however, US. forces have continuedto edge slowly forward S.E. of Epinal and have made limited gains astride theEpinal-Colmar road. The Kembs dam (ten miles south of Mulhouse) waseffectively bombed on the 7th (see &quot; Air Situation,&apos;&quot;&apos; paragraph 44).Central Group of A armies.27. There has been little change on this front apart from local gains of six to seven miles N.E. of Nancy by the Third U.S. Army, and the continuation of the attack in the Aachen sector which was launched at the beginning of lastweek by the First U.S. Army. This attack, on a corps front north of Aachensupported by smaller-scale attacks from our salient south and east of the townhas now caused the virtual isolation of Aachen by cutting the main road escaperoutes to the west. An ultimatum calling on the garrison to surrender by1050 hours the llth was ignored and heavy fighting continues.Northern Group of Armies.28. On the Second Army front, regrouping has again been the main preoccu-pation of the week, although a little ground has been gained on the west side ofthe salient towards Hertogenbosch. Further west, British and Polish troops havemade local gains in the south-western sector of the corridor along the Turnhout-Tilburg axis where our forward troops are within three miles of the latter town,which is strongly defended. North of Antwerp, the Canadians have fought their way steadily forward against stubborn resistance and have advanced to thelandward end of the isthmus connecting the island of Walcheren with the mainland.In the coastal sector, an attack by the Canadians across the Albert Canal,which was launched on the 6th with the object of clearing up the country southof the Scheldt, has made slow and difficult progress in heavy fighting and oververy marshy country which precludes the use of armour in the small bridgehead.An amphibious assault, which wras launched on the 9 th along the south bank ofthe Scheldt, has been successful in securing a bridgehead in rear of the enemy,approximately four miles wide and two miles deep. In the meantime, further attacks by heavy bombers on the island of Walcheren have made further breachesin the sea-walls. The flooding of the island is now extensive and approximately one half of its area is affected (see &quot; Air Situation,&quot; paragraph 43).Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)29. The past week has seen gradual but significant advances by the FifthArmy towrards Bologna, and an easing up of enemy resistance in the hithertostiffly held sector north of the Fiumicino River.Despite very bad weather, the British Corps to the south of the Rimini-Bologna road succeeded in getting across the Fiumicino on the 8th, and in thefollowing days enlarged the bridgehead on a wide front.On the llth, the Corps to the north of the road broke through and crossed the river north and south of Savignano, apparently without opposition.  latest reports speak of forward troops having advanced three miles up the Via Emilia,while farther south the villages of Longiano and Montiiano are in our hands.[28384] B 2
On the Fifth Army front a U.S. infantry division occupied Loiano 0.1 theFlorence-Bologna road on the 6th, and subsequently the whole front line wascarried forward to bring forward elements within 11 miles of the outskirts ofBologna by the 12th.The enemy has shown very stiff resistance to these thrusts and numerouscounter-attacks have been beaten off. On the left of the Fifth Army salientDominion armoured forces have moved up towards the Piastra-Bologna road and the road from Porretto to Borgo is now in our hands.The Campaign in Eastern Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.30. The Germans report a Russian landing on the Ribachi Peninsula (N.E.of Petsamo). On the mainland the Russians have opened an attack towardsPetsamo and made good progress.The Germans report Russian pressure S.W. of Murmansk and admit thatfighting is in progress along the Finnish-Russian frontier in this area. In CentralFinland the Germans continue to withdraw northwards, and the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Bothnia is now in Finnish hands.Northern Sector.31. The Russians have landed on Osel and now control the greater partof the island.A Russian attack in the Siauliai area has forced the Germans back on a front of-175 miles towards the Baltic coast, which the Russians have reached at a point 18 miles north of Memel. They have thus cut off the remaining german forces in Latvia, evacuation by sea being now the only possible escape. It isprobable that considerable thinning-out has already taken place.The. Russians have also made some progress towards the frontiers of east prussia&quot;from the north and east.Balkans Sector.32. After repelling enemy counter-attacks in S.E. Hungary the Russiansresumed their advance north-westwards. They are well across the River Korosand have reached the outskirts of Debrecen. Szeged and Cluj were capturedon the 11th.The Russian threat to Belgrade has increased during the week, and fightingis now taking place ten miles from the city. North of Belgrade the russians have forced the River Tisa and are well established on the western bank. Fortymiles S.E. of the city the Russians have cut the Belgrade-Nish road and railway,thus blocking the main escape route for the German forces in Serbia and Greece.Yugoslavia.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)33. Marshal Tito&apos;s forces are co-operating with the Russians in their advance towards Belgrade, which threatens a vital link in the German communi-cations, and are carrying out extensive harassing operations in other parts ofthe country.In Hercegovina they are carrying out a general offensive, and have extendedtheir hold towards the coast by the capture of two towns on the railway N.E.of Dubrovnik.In Slavonia they have taken three towns near the Hungarian border andhave pushed on to the River Drava, which here forms the frontier.Two Slovenian viaducts on the railway from Ljubljana to Trieste have beenwrecked, one by Allied bombing and the other by the Partisans.Greece.34.   The Germans are evacuating Attica, where only rear guards now remain.Our troops entered Nauplia on the 5th and a commando detachment fromKalamata escorting the Greek Governments commissioner for the Peloponnesushas reached Tripolis. Greek security troops surrendered at both places but noGermans were found.In the Northern Peloponnesus, our troops reached Rhion on the 5th andpatrols have since entered Aigion (20 miles east of Patras), Corinth, and Megara18 miles to the east; they met no opposition.
A patrol accepted the surrender of the Saraos garrison (1,000 Italians) onthe 4th.Raiding Forces Headquarters has been established on Chios with the task of accepting German surrender in the rEgean. It is under the control of G.FI.Q.,Middle East.Albania.35. Sarande was captured by a British Commando on the 9th after heavystreet fighting.   Another commando holds the hills overlooking the port.Burma.36. Our troops are closing in on Tiddim from the north and from the eastand are within a few miles of the village. In the Kabaw Valley East african troops have advanced a further five miles.and are now only 18 miles north ofKalemyo.Pacific.Palau Islands.37. The total of Japanese killed on Peleliu is now over 10,000. U.S. troops are reported to have landed on Garakayo Island, north of Peleliu. but no detailsof this operation are at present available.China.38. The Japanese have made a little progress towards Kweilin, but thereare signs that they may occupy Liuchow, 100 miles to the S.W., before attackingKweilin. They appear to be regrouping their troops, however, and bringing upsupplies before they undertake any further major advance.AIR SITUATION.General Review.39. In one period of 24 hours, nearly 11,000 sorties were flown. At other times, bad weather intervened. Further breaches were made in sea walls onWalcheren Island and a successful attack was made on an important dam nearMulhouse. Powerful blows were struck at transport centres behind the Germanlines and our aircraft co-operated with Allied artillery in the reduction of thegarrison at Aachen. Strategical bombing of war industry inside the Reichcontinued.Bad weather greatly restricted operations by the M.A.A.F. Strategicbombers attacked oil refineries in Austria and railway centres in Hungary.United Kingdom.40. Flying-bombs were again launched against this country; details are recorded under &quot; Enemy Activity and Home Security.&quot; Two He. Ill launchingaircraft were shot down by fighters off the Dutch coast.Home Waters.41. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 487 sorties involving 4,121 flying-hours ; a P.R. Spitfire and an Air-Sea Rescue aircraft are missing and one aircraftcrashed. Halifaxes, Lancasters and Mosquitoes of Bomber Command laid atotal of 143 sea-mines.Attacks on enemy shipping were pressed home with determination. In 11instances, results were promising; on many other occasions weather entirelyprecluded observation of results.Western Front.42. Weather was extremely variable and, on several days, operations were severely curtailed. However, during the 24 hours ended the 7th, our air forces,taking advantage of favourable conditions, demonstrated their striking power 
4.800 aircraft of Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Air Force, with ,100 escorting fighters, were despatched, while an additional 4,050 sorties were flown on various&quot; missions by medium and fighter bombers, transport aircraft and fighters.During the seven days ended dusk on the 10th, aircraft of the A.E.A.F.,of which 71 are missing, flew 13,984 sorties; 3.335 tons of bombs were dropped and 110 enemy aircraft were destroyed. (Note: these figures are /provisional).Aircraft of Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Commands flew 12,503sorties during the week ended dawn on the 12th; 25,434 tons of bombs were released: 168 Allied aircraft did not return. Sixty enemy aircraft were shot down, a further 88 were destroyed on the ground and 39 seaplanes were destroyed on the water.There were no reports of activity by German long-range bombers orground-attack aircraft. Enemy fighter interception varied; U.S. bombersover north-west Germany sighted a number of fighters which, however, made no attempt at interference and large-scale operations by Bomber Command met with negligible opposition in the air. On the other hand, on two occasions,vigorous reaction by 80 to 100 fighters was encountered by U.S. bombersbetween Hamburg and Berlin and again in the Leipzig area. The G.A.F.provided close support, on a moderate scale, to their troops in the Turnhout,Xijmegen. Arnhem and Aachen sectors but the estimated total sorties did notexceed 230 sorties on any day.Holland and the Siegfried Line.43. While floods, started the previous week, were spreading on the westernpart of Waleheren Island, Lancasters effectively breached sea-walls and dykes on either side of Flushing : 730 tons of bombs were dropped, causing inundations atthe aiming-points. Later. 375 tons of long-delay-action bombs were released onidentical targets north-west of Veere, on Walcheren, and a total of 1,100 tonsof bombs was dropped on gun emplacements at Flushing and on coastal batteriesat Fort Frederik Hendrik on the mainland, south of the port.Heavy bombers dropped 2,000 tons at Emmerich and 1,660 tons at Cleve,both of which are centres for enemy supply to the Xijmegen salient, and alsoheavily attacked six vital towns further to the rear Saarbrucken (1,900 tons) *Dortmund (1.700),* Coblenz (1,090), Cologne (650),* Mainz (440) and Rheine(175 tons) *Medium bombers attacked troop concentrations, bridges and ammunitiondumps in the Arnheim/Hengelo zone and strong points north of the LeopoldCanal. In the area Aachen/Duren/Euskirchen/Trier/Metz, roads, railway bridges and other military targets were attacked on many occasions.Operations by strong formations of fighters and fighter-bombers includedraids on enemy positions in the Breskens pocket, where the eastern basin near theferry was blocked by sunken barges, and on concentrations at Tilburg. On eachof three days, approximately 1,250 sorties were flown over the First Army&apos;sbattlefront in close support of our troops. East of Nancy, the Rhone-Marnecanal was bombed and a large number of roads and railways around that area was attacked; rail tracks were cut in numerous places and six canal locks andthree tunnels were destroyed. On the 11th. over 800 fighters and fighter-bombersconcentrated on strong points in Aachen, where 25 buildings were destroyed, andon communications in the vicinity. In all, approximately 7,900 sorties were flown by fighters and fighter-bombers.In the course of these tactical operations about 140 locomotives, 740 units of rolling-stock, 150 M.T. vehicles and 100 barges were destroyed; many other similar targets were damaged.A total of 1,620 sorties was flown by Dakotas (four missing) and Ansons.carrying petrol, ammunition, rations, clothing and oxygen to the battle areas andreturning with wounded, passengers, prisoners-of-war and mail. A further 50sorties were flown between Brussels and Lyons and other points within liberatedterritory.Strategical Bombing of Germany. )44. On the 7th, the Kembs dam over the Rhine, ten miles south-east ofMulhouse, was bombed by two small forces of escorted Lancasters. Five aircraft(two are missing) attacked from 8,500 feet and were followed by four others which came down to 600 feet; nine 12,000-lb. delayed-action bombs were dropped.
Shortly afterwards, a reconnaissance Mosquito saw one of the bombs explode,producing a breach in the dam through which water commenced to pour. Oneof the intentions of this attack was the isolation, on the western bank of the river,of German troops holding the Belfort Gap; its success has increased their difficulties of supply and defence.The following centres of war-industry were among the principal targetsattacked : (a) Synthetic oil installations. (Total bomb tonnage = 2,785.) Sterkrade(580 tons); Buer (495); Politz (350); Merseburg (310); Harburg (285); Bohlen(205); Lutzkendorf (205); three other (355).(b) Airfields and air ymrks. (Tota^2.565 tons.) Minister (575 tons)*;Stargard (440); Lippstadt (440); Olansthar (350): Neubrandenburg (160);Zwickau (150); Bielefeld (125); Handorf (110); three others (21.5 tons).Two Mosquitoes, despatched to the Vienna area, damaged an enemy fighter in combat and destroyed ten aircraft on airfields.(c) Aero-engine, A.F.V., M.T. and similar ivories. (Totals 1,050 tons.) Cassel (575 tons); Berlin (515)*; Hamburg (325)*: Gustavsburg U-boat Diesel-engine works (315); Zwickau (140); Schweinfurt ball-bearing works (80 tons).(d) Ordnance depots. (Toto^665 tons.)

Harassing raids byMosquitoes included three attacks on Berlin (100 tons), one on Wilhelmshaven (60),one on Cologne (60) and a total of 90 tons on other objectives.Last Month&apos;s Leaflet Operations.45. The number of leaflets distributed over Germany and France during september was 8,001,682 (of which all but about 400,000 were dropped by aircraft of Bomber Command). The comparative total for August, was 12.567,254; due tothe liberation of most of France and Belgium as well as Luxemburg, the necessityfor leaflets in these countries has practically ceased.Mediterranean Front.46. Over the whole front bad weather very greatly restricted operations.During the week ended the 10th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew a total of 5,464sorties (1,622 heavy bombers); 4,445 tons of bombs were dropped. A total of69 Allied aircraft (including 28 heavy bombers) is missing and six enemy aircraft were destroyed.Strategic bombers attacked targets in north Italy, oil refineries in the Viennaarea, railway centres and other targets in Austria, Hungary and Yugoslavia andlaid mines in the river Danube. Other aircraft attacked targets in the Italianbattle area, small shipping, airfields in Greece and a variety of targets in yugoslavia.Italy.47. U.S. heavy bombers attacked bridges at Piave/Susegana (13 miles N. ofTreviso, 69 tons), Dona Di Piave (68 tons) and Casarsa (38 tons), and railway centres at Treviso (73 toils) and Mestre (six miles NW. of Venice, 173 tons). at night, a mixed force of bombers attacked a pontoon bridge (87 tons) over theriver Po.In the battle area, a total of 492 other bombers and 1,189 fighter-bomberscarried out offensive operations. South of Bologna, troop concentrations, an ammunition dump and an M.T. park were effectively attacked by light bombers;similar aircraft made a number of hits on roads leading north through Bologna.Fighter-bombers hit a bridge S.W. of Modena and heavily attacked roads, railway lines, guns, strong points and troop concentrations; in the course of these operations eight locomotives, a number of M.T. and units of rolling-stock were destroyed.The Coastal Air Force attacked small shipping in the Adriatic and off the dalmatian coast; five small ships were probably sunk and a further five damaged.In the Gulf of Venice, a 2,000/3,000-ton tanker blew up as a result of R.P. andcannon strikes.
In the Western Mediterranean, enemy operations were confined toreconnaissance patrols, mainly over coastal areas in the northern Adriatic andLigurian seas.South-Eastern Europe.48. The Balkan Air Force flew a total of 304 sorties. Small shipping andthe harbour at Zara were attacked by light bombers, and the railway centres atMostar and Kriz (30 miles S.E. of Zagreb) were effectively bombed. An enemyheadquarters on Zirje Island (36 miles W.N.W. of Spoleto) was destroyed andat Pisino (25 miles W.S.W. of Fiume). a number of railway wagons was set on fire. Several locomotives and M.T.. two guns, two ammunition dumps and three enemy aircraft were destroyed. Nine Allied aircraft are missing from these operations.In the Vienna area. 339 U.S. heavy bombers attacked three oil refineries,681 tons of bombs being dropped; photographs showed that considerable damage was done and at one refinery a fire was seen burning along the entire length ofthe depot. Other targets attacked in Austria by heavies included several railway centres and two factories; about 350 tons were released in these operations. in hungary, U.S. heavies attacked the railway centres at Ersokujvar and Komaron(respectively 50 miles N.W. and W.N.W. of Budapest); 537 tons were dropped.Photographs taken subsequently showed many tracks cut and very severe damage done, including. over 500 goods units either destroyed or damaged. At the airfield at Gyor, 145 tons were dropped.In the Salonika area. 35 Lightnings (five missing) attacked two enemyairfields and destroyed 13 aircraft on the ground. In the Athens area,55 Mustangs (five missing) attacked four enemy airfields destroying five aircraft on the ground, an ammunition dump and an oil dump which was set on fire;22 Wellingtons carried out. at night, further attacks on three of the airfields.There was no enemy reaction to the Allied landings in the Peloponnese and onislands&quot; in the jJEgean. Enemy transport aircraft continued the evacuation fromthe iEgean Islands and Crete, although hampered by the effective attacks on theirairfields.  Allied fighters destroyed three Ju. 52 and one He. Ill in this area.In the river Danube, 21 strategic bombers laid 57 1.000-lb. sea-mines anda further four aircraft laid mines in the Euripos Channel (near Khalkis).Russia.49. In spite of bad weather, the Russian Air Force was fairly activethroughout the week, especially on the Baltic Fronts, where cover was provided forthe landings on Dagoe and Oesel Islands, for the break-through to the Memelarea and attacks made on key defence points. Enemy shipping was attacked inthe bays of the Oesel Islands, in the Gulf of Riga and in the Baltic; at least18 ships were sunk, including seven transports.

In this theatre, a cruiser-type minelayer was sunk and the followingenemy shipping was destroyed or damaged severely : two S,000-ton freighters inthe south Sulu Sea (Philippines), three others of the same tonnage in Ambonharbour, off Boetoeng Island and off Menado (Celebes), respectively. At variouslocations, 12 small steamers and 22 sea-trucks and barges were hit and, in addition,a considerable number of luggers and small craft was sunk. Ten Japanese water-borne float planes were destroyed at their base off Galdera, in the Philippines, byLightnings.In the Bonins, Liberators continued their raids on Iwojima (Kazans) andChichi jima (Ogasawara). Thunderbolts attacked Pagan, in the marinas, with bombs and rocket projectiles. A total of 260 Corsairs and Dauntless, operatingdaily, bombed Jaluit, Mille, Taroa and Wotje (Marshall Islands) and machine-gunned Kinadyeng Island. Light bombers attacked targets on Palau, includingthe airfield at Babelthuap and installations at Koror. Liberators, on each oftwo days, dropped about 30 tons of bombs on Truk atoll.Approximately 200 medium and light bombers attacked objectives in theMoluccas; the runway at Kau (Halmahera) was bombed on four days and oil storage at Kairatoe and Boela (Ceram) was attacked from a low-level.Forty Liberators (seven missing) dropped 45 tons of bombs on the importantoil refinery at Balikpapan (Borneo); of 30/40 intercepting Japanese fighters 19were shot down and nine others damaged.Aiming-points in the Celebes included go-downs and the main quays atMacassar and Bolaanguki and airfields at Ambesia (near Kendari) and Sidate(south-west of Menado); 60 Liberators operated against these targets, damagingslipways and setting fire to numerous warehouses. About the same number ofMitchells attacked similar objectives and also bombed a training area at Langoan.destroying all buildings in the vicinity.Laha airfield, Amboina, was the target on one day for a formation ofLiberators : 72 tons of bombs were dropped with very good effect. At the sametime, Lightnings made a destructive attack on Halong seaplane base, demolishinghangars and other installations. Twenty tons of bombs were dropped by liberators during an accurate attack on barracks at Ambon.In Dutch New Guinea, Kittyhawks, Thunderbolts and Bostons carried outdaily raids on enemy concentrations at Fak Fak and on Doom Island (off Sorong),airfields at Babo, Timika and Utarorn and, on one day, 85 Bostons attacked enemystores and other military targets in the Sarmi area. In British New Guinea,apart from routine operations on dumps near Wewak, the main effort was directed against concentrations of Japanese infantry near the mouth of theDanmap river; Beauforts made three attacks on these positions.During six days ended the 7th, a total of 700 sorties was flown by Corsairsand Dauntless during offensive patrols over New Britain, New Ireland andBougainville. Operations against Rabaul were resumed on the 4th, when supplycentres were attacked by 60 aircraft.ENEMY ACTIVITY AND HOME SECURITY.General.53. Enemy attacks on this country have been carried out every day and night during the past week. Flying-bombs were used on six nights and long-range rockets were used on each day and on three nights.Flying-Bombs.54. The total number of flying-bombs plotted was 71; 38 came overlandand nine fell in London. Eight were destroyed by fighter-aircraft and 21 byA.A. guns. There is some indication that the enemy is attempting to convert theDo. 217 into parent-aircraft for launching flying-bombs.[28384] q -In the provinces of fvwangsi and Kwangtung, the main attacks were directed against enemy airfields, several of which were severely damaged. Among other targets attacked were enemy positions south of Lingling (Hunan) and shipping at Pingnan on the West River, where many rivercraft were destroyed or damaged.An enemy ship was attacked and probably sunk off the west coast of Formosa.Ten enemy bombers attacked the town and airfield at Nancheng and anumber of others attacked the airfield at Liuchow.
Damage.55. On the night 6th/7th, some damage was done to business premises inOld Jewry, City. House damage was appreciable in some half-dozen incidents of which the most serious was at Hornsey (8th/9th), where Hornsey Hospital was damaged, 20 houses demolished and 50 seriously damaged, with casualties16 killed, 20 serious and one missing.Long-Range Rockets.56. The total number of long-range rocket incidents in the week was 24.All but two of these occurred outside London; 10 in Norfolk; 10 in Essex and twoin Suffolk. In one of the London incidents a gun site was hit, elsewhere damage,where caused, has been chiefly to houses.The majority of the rockets have been launched from three areas : (a) west of Apeldorn (just south of the Zuyder Zee); (b) the S.W. promontory of Friesland(on the N.E. border of the Zuyder Zee), and to a lesser extent (c) theN.E. end of Vlieland and the S.W. end of Terschelling (in the frisian islands). These points are under 200 miles from Norwich and about 250 milesfrom London. It has been confirmed that the few rockets which have recentlyfallen in the London area have come from the original launching area in thevicinity of the Hague.Casualties.57.. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 11th were34 killed and 107 seriously injured; of these all the killed and 99 serious were due to flying-bombs.

During the month 1,355 ships were convoyed without Ionsby enemy action in 50 of the principal Mediterranean convoys.(c) In addition the rescue ship of an inward bound convoy was sunk by U-boat but is excluded as rescue ships are not included in the number of ships convoyed.(d) Referring to last month&apos;s note that 1 ship had been sunk in a convoy which was still at sea at the end of that month, it is now known that the convoy did in fact arrive in theUnited Kingdom on the last day of August. &apos;&quot;&quot;

Berlin/Spandau. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 6th October, show severe damage to the Brandenburgische Motorenwerke(B.M.W. 801 aero engines). At leni,t ten workshops have been effected, many ofthem being partially destroyed or severely damaged. Other buildings that have suffered include stores buildings and offices.In the same district, several buildings of the M.T. works of Auto unions.G. have been almost entirely gutted or severely damaged and an assembly shopof the Deutsche Industrie Werke (engineering) has been hit. In addition, twoworkshops of a signalling and W/T apparatus works have received damage.2. Berlin I Spandau Neustadt. Heavy damage has been caused to the ordnance depot as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 6th October. The threelarge ordnance buildings forming the main target have each been more than three-quarters destroyed and at least eight direct hits have damaged the storesof equipment in the guns and equipment park to the SAY. of the main depot.3. Berlin I Tegel. Damage resulting from the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the6th October is well concentrated within the Alkett A.F.V. Works. None of theimportant buildings has escaped damage and the two assembly shops, in particular,have been heavily hit. Both machine shops as well as two warehouses and many other buildings have all been affected.4. Bremen. Drifting smoke obscures the old town and the opposite bankof the river, but many fires were still burning, particularly in the business and residential areas near the main station, some 20 hours after the Bomber command attack on the 6th/7th Octobei&apos;. The Deschimag shipbuilding yard and theVacuum Oil Company refinery at Oslebshausen have both received further damage and in the town itself the main passenger station has been hit.
5. Cologne. As a result of the IJ.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 2nd and 5th October, damage has been caused in the Nippes marshalling yard and in theGereon goods yard. In the former, the locomotive depot and repair shop havereceived some damage and there are many hits on the tracks. In the Gereon goodsyard, the wagon repair shop has been almost completely destroyed and the mainstructure of the carriage sheds has been affected.6. Dortmund. Eighteen hours after the attack by Bomber Command onthe 6th/7th October smoke from fires still burning in the S.W., West and N.W.obscures much of the town, but it can be seen that the Vereinigte Stahtwerke andthe Vereinigte Eleetrizitatswerke Westfalen have both been damaged.7. Hamburg I Glinde. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 6th October, show that severe damage has been caused over almost the wholeordnance depot. Five of the standard ramped buildings have been partly destroyed and two of the standard buildings without ramps have been similarlyaffected. The rail tracks through the depot have been cut in at least ten places and rolling-stock and stores in the open have been damaged.8. Hamburg/Moorfleth. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the 6th October are free of smoke and confirm the heavy damage to the KlocknerFlugmotorenbau (B.M.W. 801 aero engines). The large machine shop, one ofthe medium machine shons, the boiler house, and the two storage and despatchbuildings are among those that have been practically destroyed. Every building in the labour camp has been damaged and three unidentified buildings in the plant gutted. N.W. of the Klockner Works considerable damage has been cloneto two factories, one manufacturing chemicals for bakery supplies and the othermaking cement blocks, &amp;c.&quot;9. Munster. As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attacks of the 30th september and the 5th October, small workshops and other buildings of the Ludwig Hansenaircraft repair factory have been gutted and the main workshop has been damaged. Heaviest damage has occurred in the marshalling yard and railjunction. Business and residential damage is considerable and among the manypublic buildings affected are the large prison and the training barracks in theDalweg district, both of which have been almost destroyed by fire. Heavy damage has been caused on the Munster Loddenheide airfield and the entire landing ground has been saturated with craters. Of the five hangars, one has been almostdestroyed and the other four damaged, while the barracks area has suffered severely. There are many hits on taxi and perimeter tracks and several of thewest and east starting platforms.10. Rheine Marshalling Yard. As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 5th October some 75 craters have cut all tracks in the sidings, the passenger station has been three-quarters destroyed and the locomotive shed, four trans-shipment sheds, a goods shed and several other buildings have been severely damaged. Several factory buildings in the vicinity have been heavily affected,and there is considerable damage to business property on either side of the marshalling yard.11. Saarbrucken. In spite of smoke from fires still burning in the town,it can be seen that the Bomber Command attack on the 5th /6th October causedsevere and concentrated damage. Districts principally affected are Burbach,Maistatt, St. Johann, and Alt-saarbrucken. -The works of Vereinigte Hiitten-werke Burbach-Eichdudlingen have been severely damaged.Norway.12. Bergen. As a result of the Bomber Command attack on the 4th Octoberat least one direct hit has been made on the roof of the Laaksevaag U-Boatshelters, but, owing to the unfinished state of the pens, no statement can be made from these photographs as to penetration. In the neighbouring shipyards, very heavy damage has been caused, three machine shops having been destroyed and twomachine shops and two boiler shops damaged. Severe damage has also been caused to shipping in the harbour. Two 500-ton U /Boats and one 250-foot M.V.have been sunk, two floating docks seriously damaged, the 510-foot M.V. Schwab enis beached and probably seriously damaged, and a 500-ton II/Boat has a slight list.
