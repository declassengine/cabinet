THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S.&quot;GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 597..27th October, 1944RELEASE OF CAPACITY FROM MUNITIONS PRODUCTION.Note by the Minister, of Production.AT their meeting on &quot;the 17th October the War Cabinet (W.M. (44)138th Conclusions, Minute 2) considered a memorandum by myself (W.P. (44) 573)to which was attached a draft letter to Mr, Philip Reed.2. Ministers were invited to send to me any comments on the draft, the final text of which was to be settled in consultation with the Foreign Office. I now circulate for information a copy of the letter as finally sent. I have underlined*the passages which were modified to meet the views&apos;of my colleagues.O. L.Ministry of Production,Great George Street, S.W. 1,27th October, 1944.ANNEX.Copy of a Letter dated 25th October, 1944, from the Minister of production to Mr. Philip Reed.      -I think it would be useful if we were to tell you something of the courseof our programme changes.2. You will, I think, know that the man-power shortage has been hittingus with increasing severity during 1944 and, on the last assessment which wasmade on the 13th July, it was necessary for us to face a reduction of about 250,000persons in the munitions industries during the second half of this year. Thesecuts were made necessary, not only by the demands of the Armed Forces them-selves, but also to meet the pressing needs of certain parts of our economy, suchas mining, food processing, merchant navy, nursing, repair and maintenance,which had been denuded of labour in our attempt to get maximum impactduring 1944.3. This cut of 250.000 looked, when we planned it, very difficult to achievewithout damage to essential production, but with the development of the campaignon the Continent we are reaching a position in the war when we can plan more closely upon our experience and there is some hope that by the end of the year the cut tvill be achieved.4. There is a further consideration on the man-power side which is causingus some concern. In order to carry out to the greatest extent that we could the doctrine of maximum impact in 1944 we mobilised our women up to the age of 51,Copy No.   3gWAR CABINET.[28479]* Printed in italics.
and we feel that there is a serious risk that we shall not be able to hold womenover 45 in munitions work throughout the winter before us, and that this labour force will probably be permanently lost to industry. Our industrial labour force will decline apart from this probability and when we make allowance for the continuing claims which I have referred to earlier in this letter, it is obviousthat we must plan our munitions production next year within substantiallysmaller totals.5. Workpeople set free by the cuts (except in so far as they are absorbed into the Armed Forces) are normally transferred to other essential war work.To-day there are still about 45,000 &quot; preference vacancies &quot; unfilled in this held.But because of the time which would &quot;be involved in training or transferringsome of this displaced labour for further production of munitions which may notbe required if all goes well, some of it may be used for civilian production. Ido not want this fact, or the fact that there may be some transitional unemploy-ment. to give rise to the impression that our economy is not overstrained.Unfortunately it is.6. The major changes which are about to be implemented are for theaircraft programme. A new programme has been prepared and the consequentialcuts will shortly be announced. Although it is proposed to put this programmeinto force immediately, the effect will not be seen, in terras of finished aircraft,for some months ahead. The aircraft supply which flows from this programme will cover the needs of the Air Force, even if the German war lasts until themiddle of 1945. It will, at the same time,&quot; permit the more rapid production ofthose special types which are required for the Japanese war. The plan for reductions will permit us to reduce the inventory held by manufacturers for thosemachines which are not required, or required in much smaller numbers, once theGerman war is ended. A s far as the man-power demands of the programme areconcerned, I believe that the new aircraft programme will provide for a somewhatlarger reduction in the aircraft labour force than the demands of the armed forces and other essential work in 1945 would require if the war with Germany wereto continue right through the year. This is not true, however, in 1944, whenice shall, as I have said above, just about be able to operate our munitionprogrammes ivithin the present man-power ceilings. But it is clear that, underthe new ^programme, there will newt year be some labour available for transfer to civilian &quot;production.7. But I want to emphasise the flexibility of our plans. Even at the middleof 1945 the production at present planned is, of course, in excess of what iswanted for the Japanese war. When the German war ends, or if it is certain for production purposes that it is going to end in the near future, then not only shallwe advance the date of some of the reductions now planned for specific monthsahead, but we shall be able immediately to operate many additional cuts, theextent of which must, of course, depend in part upon the arrangements made for supply from the United States during Stage II. If, on the other hand, it became apparent that we ought to cover the needs of the Services for fighting againstGermany in the second half of 1945, then we should have to make a completereview of our man-power situation and, to the extent that, was possible, some cutsnow programmed would have to be postponed.8. Supply Departments will now be discussing with manufacturers all threetypes of programme adjustment. First, there are the immediate cuts which, likethose of the past, are dictated by the short-term man-power situation. Secondly,there are the cuts which come into operation within the next few months but whichmay well be accelerated if the course of the war permits it. Finally, manu-facturers are being warned of the changes in programme to the levels for Stage IIwhich will be put into action at the end of the war in Europe-or at an earlier date if the future seems sufficiently clear. As soon as we think this date can befixed, we shall, of course, advise you.OLIVER LYTTELTON.
