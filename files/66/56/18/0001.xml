THIS DOCUMENT JS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 568.11th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.RELIEF FOR OCCUPIED EUROPE.Memorandum by the Minister of State.   S1. On the 21st August the War Cabinet (W.M. (44),KMihute 5) agreed tothe setting up of an Anglo-American Committee in London to draw up a schemeof relief for submission to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to the United StatesGovernment. A joint Committee was accordingly set up, and I annex heretoits recommendations.2.- Experience has shown that any relaxation of the blockade brings somebenefit, direct or indirect, to the enemy, and one of the strongest objections to allowing food relief through the blockade has been that we should relieve theenemy of his responsibility and involve ourselves in an ever-growing commitment.In present circumstances, however, it seems improbable that any substantial quantities of food-stuffs could reach territory still occupied by the enemy, andthe present scheme only contemplates making good a modest increase in theamount of relief food-stuffs which Sweden sends to Norway, and possibly thedespatch of small consignments from Switzerland to Polish cities, ghettos andconcentration camps. The economic benefit to the enemy from this programmed could only be slight and in view of the political importance which the UnitedStates Government attach to the matter. I suggest that we should approve thescheme3. If the War Cabinet agree to the adoption of the scheme, we must decide whether to say anything to the Russians before sending relief to Poland. Wewould not, I think, have to obtain Russian concurrence on the Norwegian proposal,which only involves a certain relaxation of our controls under the Anglo-American-Swedish War Trade agreement, to which Russia is not a party.4. The&apos;argument in favour of consulting the Russians about relief to poland is that the provision for relief for an occupied country might be interpreted as assistance to the enemy occupying forces and therefore as a liability to the approaching Allied Forces. The argument against consultingthem is that they have in the past tended to be somewhat indifferent to the fate of occupied peoples, and particularly to that of the Poles, and that they mayraise difficulties (a) as regards the International Red Cross and (b) the PolishGovernment, with neither of whom they have any relations. They may alsosuggest that the Polish National Committee should be consulted, which would raise difficulties for us. I therefore recommend to my colleagues that we shouldnot ask their concurrence but should merely tell them what we are doina.R. K. L.Foreign Office, 11th October, 1944.12536   [28381]
ANNEX.Recommendations of the Joint Anglq-American Relief Committee,3rd October. 1944.Norway.1. (i) The United States and British Governments will permit compen-sating imports into Sweden to replace food-stuffs sent as relief to Norway (as faras supply considerations permit) and will allow the onshipment to Norway offood-stuns imported through the Allied controls. They will also relax the ruleforbidding the export from Sweden to Norway of produits similaires. Theserelaxations in blockade policy will be made to enable an increase in the extent of relief feeding in Norway both as regards numbers of beneficiaries and variety ofdiet (a) in schools.(b) in canteens for aged people.(c) in organised community centres or under special schemes approved by theJoint Standing Commission in Stockholm.(ii) They will also permit children&apos;s clothing to be sent in small lots providedthat the despatch of each consignment will be contingent upon receipt of satis-factpry reports on the distribution of previous consignments.(iii) All proposed shipments, both of food and clothing, will be submitted tothe Joint Standing Commission in Stockholm as constituted under the Anglo-American-Swedish&quot; War Trade Agreement of 1943. The United States andBritish members of the Commission will be given wide discretion to approveconsignments and will only refer to Washington and London (a) in cases of doubt; and(b) for goods other than those specified above.(iv) Reports on distribution will be submitted to the Joint standing commission, Stockholm.2. The Norwegian Government will be informed of these proposals andconsulted as to the form and extent of relief to be provided. They will be askedto submit proposals for the finance of these operations.3. The Swedish Government will be asked to submit estimates of theadditional relief assistance that can be provided through the existing machinery and the approximate quantities of additional imports required through ourcontrols.4.   The German Government will be asked for -. (a) safe-conducts for. all transport carrying relief supplies, complete freedomof movement and guarantees of personal safety for supervisorypersonnel;(6) assurance that rations will be maintained and that imports to Norwayfrom German Europe will be maintained at a rate not less than thatprevailing at the corresponding period of the previous year;(c) an assurance that the distribution of relief supplies will be permitted in any part of Norway selected by the approved neutral organisations,after consultation with the Joint Standing Commission;(d) release from the Baltic and safe-conducts for any additional tonnagerequired. (The United States and British Governments will beprepared to give the same assurances as now given in the case of swedish ships in the Greek Relief Services.)Poland.5. (i) The International Red Cross Committee will be informed that theUnited States and British Governments are willing to admit through theircontrols food for distribution :  (a) in selected cities where the International Red Cross Committee reporturgent need and where distribution can be made by them or through their agents in canteens, schools or other community centres; all foodwill be consumed in these centres;(b) in other areas by means of food parcels sent to individuals or groups of individuals, provided the International Red Cross Committee can obtain verification that the parcels are received and retained by the intended ben eficiaries.
(ii) The United States and British Governments will also permit children&apos;sclothing to be sent in small lots provided that the despatch of each consignmentwill be contingent upon the receipt of satisfactory reports on the distribution of previous consignments.6. The Polish Government will be informed of these proposals andconsulted both as to the form and the extent of the relief to be provided : they willbe asked to submit proposals for the finance of these operations.7.   The International Red Cross Committee will be asked :-(a) to submit names of cities where need is acute and estimates of the quantities of food that they can distribute in both bulk and parcelform, and(b) to indicate the extent and form of control which they can exercise in eachcase.8.   The German Government will be&quot;asked by the International Red cross committee for (a) safe-conducts for all transport carrying relief supplies, freedom of move-ment and guarantees of personal safety, for supervisory personnel,(b) assurances that rations will be maintained and that no reduction will bemade in normal supplies to the area concerned,(c) assurance that distribution of relief supplies will be permitted in anycities and any parts of such cities selected by the International red cross Committee.Czechoslovakia and Denmark.D. Although it is not thought that there is acute need for relief in Czeeho-slovakia and Denmark, the Czech Government and the Danish Council will be consulted and if it appears that need in any particular areas has become urgent,action similar to that proposed for Poland will be authorised.Other A reas.10. In view of the present military situation it is not thought necessary tomake recommendations for the Netherlands and for Yugoslavia. Should, however,these countries or any part of them remain under settled enemy occupation duringthe Winter, similar action to that proposed for Poland will be authorised.Concentration Camps.11. The policy of the United States and British Governments with regardto concentration and internment camps and Jews in ghettos will be the same asin recent months, namely, that the International Red Cross Committee will be permitted to despatch relief food-stuffs to any such camp or ghetto where it is satisfied as to the conditions of distribution.12.   The United States and British Governments have been in communica-tion with the International Reel Cross Committee regarding the possibility ofthe safe distribution of clothing in such camps and, if adequate assurances are -received, they will be prepared to permit experimental consignments of children&apos;sclothing.Vitamins.13.   Arrangements have already been made to despatch vitamin D tooccupied territories in the same way as medical supplies.It is now proposed to add vitamins B and C.Monetary Relief.14. It is suggested that licences which involve or may involve the placing of funds in neutral territory at the disposal of enemy persons should only beissued after consultation between the United States and British Governments.Normally such consultation should take place between the State Department andthe British Embassy in Washington, who would be given a wide discretion toagree to their issue,&quot; reference to the Relief sub-committee in London only being necessary in doubtful cases.(Note. The American representatives on the Committee reserved their position on paragraph 14 and the United States Ambassador is referringthe matter separately to his Government.)
