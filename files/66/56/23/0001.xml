THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTI J &apos;Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Cotfy No.   3JoVy No.W.P. (44) 573.14th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.RELEASE OF CAPACITY FROM MUNITIONS PRODUCTION.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.IN collaboration with the Minister of Labour, my colleagues of the supply departments and the President of the Board of Trade, I have been consideringwfhat effect substantial cuts in our munitions programme would have on thenegotiations for aid in Stage II now opening in Washington.2. It is quite clear to us all that it is impossible to issue instructions that immediate reductions in programmes, to the considerable extent proposed, shouldbe put into operation now without this fact becoming widely known. the americans are making elaborate preparations for programme adjustments in stage II but have stated that no action will be taken until the end of the german war has been announced.3. The proposals we have so far been considering might be most embarrass-ing to the American Administration at this time, who might be pressed toexplain why immediately after they had promised assistance to us in Stage IIwe were making immediate and substantial cutbacks in our programmes, while. the American negotiators themselves might argue that postponement of the cuts would lessen our demands upon them. At ail costs such misunderstanding mustbe prevented. We can only do this by ensuring that such cuts as. are made between now and the end of the year do not carry us beyond the man-poweradjustments which we planned in July to make in the last half of the year. Thesewe can defend without reference to the 31st December hypothesis for the endof the German war. In any case, that hypothesis has no longer full support,and having regard to the course of the war we are justified in postponing thefull reduction of our programmes.4. So far as the Ministry of Supply are concerned, postponement for at least a month of the additional cuts they were to make offers no difficulty. . i5. The Ministry of Aircraft Production programme, with the full reduc-tion planned (the September programme), threw up a substantially larger number of workers this year than man-power ceilings required and acceleratedthe rate of decline in the early part of 1945. The new Ministry of aircraft production proposals (W.P. (44) 572) seem to be a satisfactory compromise. Iwould propose to explain the whole position, on the lines of the annexed draft, toMr. Philip Reed and, through my representatives in Washington, to theiropposite numbers.6. In the near future the military situation and the course of negotiations in the United States and the possible American reaction to our plans may allbecome clearer. If the situation is favourable, the postponed cuts may be accelerated again and further cuts could be brought into operation.7. I should like to emphasise that nothing in the above should deterDepartments from completing their detailed arrangements for reducing pro-duction, as nearly as possible, to the final Stage II level at the proper time, eventhough dates cannot now be given. In particular it is most desirable that thereshould be the closest collaboration between the Board of Trade, the supply departments and the contractors. Unless this is done we shall, when the time comes, be faced with a considerable measure of transitional unemployment.O. L.Ministry of Production,Great George Street, S.W. 1,14th October, 1944.[28395]
DRAFT LETTER TO Mr. PHILIP REED-MISSION FOR economic affairs IN LONDON.I think it would be useful if we were to tell you something of the course ofOur programme changes.2. You will, I think, know that the man-power shortage has been hitting us with increasing severity during 1944 and, on the last assessment which was madeon the 13th July, it was necessary for us to face a reduction of about 250,000persons in the munitions industries during the second half of this year. Thesecuts were made necessary, not only by the demands of the Armed Forcesthemselves, but also to meet the pressing needs of certain parts of our economy,such as mining, food processing, merchant navy, nursing, repair and maintenance,which had been denuded of labour in our attempt to get maximum impactduring 1944.3. This cut of 250,000 looked, when we planned it, very difficult to achievewithout damage to essential production, but with the development of the campaignon the Continent we are now reaching a position in the war when we can planmore closely upon our experience and can operate throughout on somewhat smallerstocks and reserves than has been possible in the past. We now feel that by theend of the year the cut will be achieved.4. There is a further consideration on the man-power side which is causingus some concern. In order to carry out to the greatest extent that we could the doctrine of maximum impact in 1944 we mobilised our women up to the ageo)f 51, and we feel that there is a serious risk that we shall not be able to holdwomen over 45 in munitions work throughout the winter before us, and that thislabour force will probably be permanently lost to industry.j &apos; 5. But I want to emphasise the flexibility of our plans. Even at the middle/ of 1945 the production planned is, of course, far in excess of what is wanted forI the Japanese war. When the German war ends, or if it is certain for productionpurposes that it is going to end in the near future, then not only shall we advance the date of some of the reductions now planned for specific months ahead, butwe shall be able immediately to operate many additional cuts, the extent of which; must, of course, depend in part upon the arrangements made for supply from theUnited States during Stage II. If, on the other hand, it became apparent thatwe ought to cover the needs of the Services for fighting against Germany in thesecond half of 1945, then to the extent made possible by our man-power situationsome cuts already programmed would be postponed.6. Supply Departments will now be discussing with manufacturers all threetypes of programme adjustment.   First, there are the immediate cuts which,I like those of the past, are dictated by the short-term man-power situation.&apos; Secondly, there are the cuts which come into operation within the next fewmonths but which may well be accelerated if the course of the war demands it.I Finally, manufacturers are being warned of the changes in programme to theI levels for Stage II which will be put into action at the end of the war or at an earlier date if the future seems sufficiently clear.   As soon as we think this date, can be fixed we shall, of course, advise you.

&quot;Our industrial labour force will decline apart fromthis probability and when we make allowance for the con-tinuing claims which I have referred to earlier in this letter,  it is obvious that we must plan our munitions production next year within substantially smaller totals.Workpeople  set free by the cuts (except insofar as theyare absorbed into the Armed Forces) are normally transferredto other essential war work.      To-day there are still abouth-5,000 &quot;preference&quot; vacancies unfilled in this field.      but because of the time which would be    involved in training ortransferring some of this displaced labour for further pr&amp;f-duction of munitions which may not be required if all goeswell,  some of it may be used for civilian production.      Ido not want this fact or the fact that there may be sometransitional unemployment to give rise to the impression that our economy is not overstrained.      Unfortunately it is.The major changes which are about to be implementedare for. the aircraft programme.      A new programme has beenprepared and the consequential cuts will shortly be announced.Some of them we are able to put into force straight&apos; away,others will not be effective,   in terms of finished aircraft?for some months ahead.      The aircraft sup-ply which flows fromthis programme will cover the needs of the Air Force,   evenif the German war lasts until the middle of 19^5.      It will?at the same time, permit the more rapid production of thosespecial types which are required for the Japanese war.      Theplan for reductions will permit us.to reduce the inventoryheld by manufacturers for those machines which are notrequired, or required in much smaller numbers,  once theGerman war is ended.      So far as the manpower demands of theprogramme are concerned,   they will be somewhat less,  Ibelieve,  then would perhaps be possible in the situation nextyear if the&quot;war with Germany were to last right through theyear.      In 19-!!-,  however, we shall be fortunate if we canoperate our munitions programme within our manpower ceilings.If the course of the war permitted this programme to  stand,we should,  in fact,  next year see some labour releasable for civilian -production&quot;. m
