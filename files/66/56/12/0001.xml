(44) 562.19th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.INDIAN EOOD SITUATION:  SIR HENRY FRENCH&apos;visit TO INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.IN .the early summer of this year, I was asked by the authorities in India,and particularly by the Governor of Bengal, to secure a number of officers with experience of food administration to strengthen the machine in India. I suggested to the Ministry of Food that it might be well for a senior officer ofthe Ministry to pay a short visit to India to gain first-hand acquaintance withIndiap conditions, to satisfy himself as to the reality of the need, and obtain a clearer view of the qualifications required. In the event, Sir Henry Frenchhimself undertook this mission.Sir Henry French spent six weeks in India, returning on the 30th September.He has embodied an account of his experiences, and of the views which heformed, in the shape of a very valuable and comprehensive review, which dealswith wider matters than those of personnel. This document I circulate forinformation.I propose to invite my colleagues on the Indian food grains Committee toconsider at an early date Sir Henry&apos;s survey of the Indian food situation andthe suggestions which he has included in it.L. S. A.India Office,10th October, 1944.[28348]b
ANNEXURE.To the Permanent Under-Secretary ofState for India,India Office. Whitehall,London. S.W. 1.Sir. 3rd October. 1944.1 have the honour to submit the following report, embodying certain views which I have formed and certain recommendations which I desire to make forthe consideration of the Secretary of State for India as a result of the visit whichI have just paid to India to study the food situation there.Preliminary.2. Accompanied by my Private Secretary, Miss W. E. Munns, I left london on Tuesday, the 8th August, arriving in Karachi on Friday, the *Llth August.Between then and the 26th September, when I left Karachi en route to London,I visited and studied the food situation in the Provinces of Sind, Delhi, Bombay.United Provinces, Bengal. Madras and Punjab, and also in the States of Cochinand Travancore.3. During the six and a half weeks I spent in India I had the privilege of discussing the food situation with his Excellency the Viceroy, and personallywith the Governor of every Province in British India. Those Governors whom was unable to meet in their own Province granted me an interview in New Delhiwhen they were attending a Conference of Governors, over which the Viceroypresided, during the period the 29th August to 1st September.4. In addition, I had detailed discussions with the Hon. Member for Food,and with officers of the Central Government, and of the Governments of provinces and States. Wherever I went I seized the opportunity of meeting non-officialpersons interested in the subject. For example, in Ahmednagar, a country townabout 80 miles east of Poona. I met the members of the local Price AdvisoryCommittee. In Bombay I attended a meeting of the Standing Committee of theFood Advisory Council of the Province in addition to meeting and talking with many residents in the city. In Calcutta I was entertained to tea by the BengalNational Chamber of Commerce and was the only European present at a gatheringof about 50 members of the Chamber. In Lahore I was entertained to dinnerby the Indian Chamber of Commerce. In Ernakulam (Cochin) and inTrivandrum (Travancore) special meetings were called of local representativepeople not connected with food administration to enable me to discuss localproblems with them.5. During my visit to India I gave three interviews to the Piess : the firstin Karachi on the day after my arrival; the second in Delhi a few days before istarted on my lours of India; and the final one in Lahore on the clay on which mytours were completed. Throughout the period I spent in India the Press was kept fully informed as to my movements through the Principal InformationOfficer of the Government of India. Although in a few papers an attempt wasmade to suggest that my visit wras surrounded with mystery, or that it was aningenious device by the Secretary of State for India to avoid facing up to therecommendations of the Gregory Committee in regard to imports, the vast majority of the newspapers in India adopted an extremely friendly and helpfulattitude. Wherever I went it was quite clear that local people, both official and non-official, had a general knowledge of the object of my visit and were preparedto do everything in their power to help me to obtain in a very short space of timeinformation respecting the huge problem of the feeding of the people of india during the present emergency.6. Set out in Appendix A to this report is a list of the principal persons inIndia with whom I have had individual discussions. In Appendix B is a shortsummary of my tours, indicating the principal places in which local conditions were studied in detail.
7. For the sake of brevity, this report is restricted to questions of first-class importance with which his Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is directly and closely concerned. A large number of other questions, both of policyand of administration, which are matters for the Government of India and forthe Governments of Provinces and States, are not dealt with in this report, but have been discussed in considerable detail with the responsible authorities inIndia. Records of some of these discussions and other relevant documentationhave been left with the Food Department in Delhi for future reference if required.General Picture of Food Situation.8. It is impossible to isolate the food situation and study it apart from allother considerations. It is greatly affected by many other considerations, someof which are of a general character.9. From the point of view of policy and administration, the Act of 1935has practically made it impossible for the Government of India to impose itsviews on the Government of a Province. Provision for this is made in the Act,but in practice, seeing that the administration must remain with the Govern-ments of the Provinces, the provision is of little or no value. The position inregard to the States is even more delicate. The result is that the actions of governments of Provinces and States can only be influenced by persuasion. Itis obvious that persuasion is likely to be more effective in the case of deficiencyProvinces and States which are looking to the Central Government to provide them with food supplies than it is in the case of surplus Provinces which, speakingbroadly, have little or nothing to gain for themselves by carrying out the wishes of the Central Government. This fact has, in my view, an important effect on the quantities of food grains produced in India which become available for exportfrom a surplus to a deficiency Province.10. Another important factor which affects the food situation generally isthe almost complete absence in every part of India of any sense of responsibilityfor the welfare of any other part. This is true not only of the attitude of a surplusProvince to the requirements of a deficiency Province; it is equally true of theattitude of a surplus area in a * deficiency Province towards the rest of theProvince. There is a small amount of evidence of what one might roughly describeas provincial patriotism, but I observed nothing that indicated any sense ofresponsibility anywhere for India as a whole.11. Another consideration which, so far as I am aware, is not oftendiscussed in official reports is the widespread system (for it practically amountsto a system) of graft. It is found everywhere and is accepted by Indians andBritish alike as a state of affairs which no efforts of Government have been able,or are likely to be able, to eradicate. It is mentioned particularly in the ease ofthe Railways. I have heard it alleged that illicit payments are frequently madeto secure priority of movement of wagons. I was authoritatively told that duringthe worst period of the Bengal famine traders, by means of bribes, obtained priority for the movement on the Railways of their private goods, while food suppliesdestined to relieve the situation in Bengal were left standing in the Punjab, UP.and other surplus areas. In addition, the black market presents a much greaterobstacle to good administration in India than it does in the United Kingdom. Inthe case of food grains, the Government acquires only a small proportion of thetotal quantity which enters into commerce. - The alternative market is free of effective control and is obviously a wide opening for breaches of price regulations12. Conditions such as I have described in the three preceding paragraphsmake administration by British standards almost impossible. If such conditions were entirely absent the tasks of the Central Government and the Governmentsof Provinces and States would be difficult enough. As things are these Govern-ments are faced with a colossal task. The immense areas to be covered, the enormous population to be served, the great variety of conditions in different parts of India, the small number of trained administrative personnel, the lowstandard of integrity among food traders, all add greatly to the difficultiesof the task of feeding the people of India under Government control.13. The crux of the present food situation is, of course, the loss of riceimports from Burma since 1942 consequent on the success of the Japanesemilitary operations in that year, which the Government of India had no reasonto anticipate or to prepare for. The imports from Burma cannot be replacedeither from within or from without the country.   In Bengal and in the States[28348] b 2
of Cochin and Travancore, there are people who, if they cannot get rice, willnot eat other food grains even if this means that they will starve and die. Thereis, unfortunately, no easy cure for this lamentable situation. The Food Depart-ment is endeavouring to persuade rice-eaters to widen their diets to includeother food grains but, although in some areas a measure of success has beenobtained, the process is bound to be a slow one and is not likely to have any appreciable effect in, say, 1945.14. The absence of rice imports has brought about the present dangerousfood situation in India generally: the only area in which an opportunity exists for the taking of substantial measures to reduce the ill-effects throughout india of the shortage of rice supplies is the Province of Bengal. Although Bengalis normally a net importer of rice, the Province produces far more rice than any other Province. Its average production is approximately equal to one-thirdof the total rice production in all India. Bengal has had a bumper rice crop.This has saved the situation for 1944. But in spite of the fact that the CentralGovernment has supplied the foodgrain requirements for Calcutta itself from sources outside the Province of Bengal, the quantity of rice now under the controlof the P. vincial Government which can be used as a carry-over to help theposition in 1945 (the outlook for which is recognised as far less favourable than was the case in the current year) is very small. No doubt cultivators, in additionto retaining rice for their domestic consumption, have this year replaced their reserves which were exhausted last year. Even so, these supplies are of little value from the point of view of security as compared with, say, 500,000 tonsin the hands of the Provincial Government. Whether such a reserve could havebeen produced by a more energetic administration (see para. 24) I am notable to say.15. If, in 1945, the Central Government has not only to continue to accept responsibility for the feeding of Calcutta, but possibly also to supply some ricefor the remaining part of Bengal, the position of other rice-eating areas inIndia may well prove to be desperate. To-day in Cochin State, for example,where the population is accustomed to a diet composed almost entirely of rice,the rice ration is only, on the average, 5-3 ozs. per day per person out ofa total cereal ration of 12 ozs. with the children receiving only half the rationup to their thirteenth birthday. It is a small and well-administered State,otherwise there would have been a famine in Cochin State just as there was in bengal. At the time of my visit the working stocks only amounted to 1\ weeks&apos;requirements of the rationed off take. If, in 1945, the Central Governmenthas to supply large quantities of rice to the Government of Bengal, Cochin andTravancore and possibly other parts of India will inevitably be very close tostarvation.16. In my judgment the only way to increase the rice supply to rice-eating areas would be to secure that throughout India people who eat wheatshould reduce their consumption of rice to the barest possible minimum. If this were done, the exportable surplus from some Provinces would be increased.Even if the increase so secured proves to be but a small fraction of the aggregatedeficiency (as it almost certainly would) the psychological value of people inone part&quot;of India making a sacrifice for the benefit of some other part of india would, in my view, be of great importance and value. Even in rice-eating areasthere are a number of people who could live quite well without eating any rice.On two successive days, while I was in a rice-eating area, I was entertained toluncheon in well-to-do private houses, the first British and the other Indian.In each case rice was served quite unnecessarily, although within a few milesthere were millions of people on the verge of starvation owing to the smallnessof the rice ration. Nothing but an energetic campaign to bring home to bothIndian and British people the desirability of refusing to buy any rice whateverif they can live on wheat and wheat products can improve the food situation inthe rice-eating areas and then only to an inadequate extent. The attempt toI obtain the result desired by prohibiting the consumption of rice by Order would,I think, fail. On the other hand, from such enquiries as I was able to make,I feel that the moment is opportune for a widespread appeal to the people ofIndia on the lines which I have suggested. Such an appeal would not be effective if made only by the Central Government. It would have to beenergetically supported by the Governments of Provinces and States concerned.Only if such an appeal produced the desired result would India derive thethe full benefit of the future wheat imports which T have recommended as necessary in this Report.
17. From the above brief summary of the&apos; position it might be thoughtthat the food troubles with which India is faced are to a large extent of itsown making, and that the cure for these troubles should therefore be sought inIndia itself. In my view this would not be a fair judgment. The organisationof India for war purposes during the last five years has had an immense effect. on the food situation to-day. For example, it is universally agreed that if thecultivator had the opportunity of purchasing more consumer goods he wouldbe more willing to market his wheat and rice than he is at present. The shortageof consumer goods has been brought about by deliberate policy, and the diversion of such commodities as cloth to Army usage has greatly assisted the war effort.The diversion of man-power to war factories has affected the production of the farms. Similarly the diversion of railway wagons to military uses, whileessential as a defence measure, has greatly handicapped the transport of grainfor civilian consumption. Undoubtedly the shortage of transport within Bengalwas one of the factors which contributed to the famine in that Province. Inbrief, the organisation of India for defence purposes has intensified the difficultiesof the food situation.Scope of Enquiry.18. During my tours of India, and during the discussions in New Delhiwhich preceded and followed them, I have been principally concerned with threeaspects of the food situation.   They are : (1) How far would it be possible to improve by administrative changes the feeding of the people of India?(2) Is the food now being grown in India being put to the best possible use ?(3) If, during the present emergency, India cannot be self-supporting inregard to food supplies, what would be the most satisfactory arrange-ment for filling the gap between essential requirements and indigenoussupplies 1Administration.19. During the course of my tours a large number of administrative points were discussed with representatives rjf Provincial Governments and States.Subsequently, the more important of these were discussed with the Secretary ofthe Food Department in New Delhi. None of these matters is of sufficient importance to justify detailed treatment in this Report, more especially as it-became obvious from the latter discussions that there was a wide measure ofagreement between Mr. Hutchings and me on all major issues.20. I have suggested that wherever necessary and practicable, the RegionalFood Commissioner organisation should be strengthened, and that wherever it is adequate for the purpose more effective use should be made of it as a means of influencing the Governments of Provinces and States in both policy and administration. I have also urged that the ration allowances for children shouldbe increased with the minimum of delay. At present, in most areas, no ration&apos; of food grains is allowed for children from the time of birth to two years of age.and after that they receive only half the adult ration until they reach theirthirteenth birthday. I was glad to learn that the Food Department are in favourof altering this arrangement so that half the ration would be available for children from the date of birth until they have completed their eighth year.After that, they would be eligible for the full&apos;ration.21. Another matter of administration to which I attach great importance is the use of technical knowledge possessed by foqd traders in the procurementand custody of supplies of food grains. On this point, many experienced persons(riot by any means limited to I.C.S. officers) have expressed to me serious doubt as to whether the introduction of food traders, having regard to their attitude in the past to food control in India, would bring about any improvement in thepresent arrangements. Needless to say, I recognise the reasonableness of these doubts. Nevertheless, from what I have myself seen, I feel confident that theemployment of the most reliable and experienced food traders who are availablecould not fail, if their work was properly organised and supervised, to effect a substantial reduction in the serious losses of food-stuffs which are at present. occurring.22. The Public Relations activities of the Food Department could, in myopinion, be greatly extended with advantage to consumers generally.   In India,
only a small percentage of the public can read; still fewer actually read news-papers; the proportion of the public who attend cinemas is insignificant. Thedifficulties in the way of Public Relations are, therefore, very great. Practicallyevery newspaper printed in English circulates week by week false and misleadinginformation on the food situation and on what the Central and provincial governments are doing and have done to assist the public. I am told that thevernacular Press more frequently makes fair use of official information supplied to them. From my own knowledge, however. I can say that a large proportion ofnon-official persons rely on inaccurate information derived from the Press becausenone other is available to them. It would, in my view, be well worth wdiile tomake a determined and sustained effort to test whether, by one means or another,the true facts could not be placed before at least those members of the public whorend newspapers. If it is found that official announcements are not fairly oradequately reproduced in news columns, resort should, I recommend, be had tothe advertisement columns of carefully selected newspapers. The expenditure would, I feel sure, justify itself handsomely. Needless to say I am not advocatingthat any attempt should be made either in news or advertisement columns to&quot;boost&quot; a Government or an individual Minister. Nor should the materialprepared for the purpose have the appearance of defending or justifying theadministration. The object should be to give readers facts which are of interestto them and to present these facts in a way which will attract leaders&apos; attention.The Food Departments uphill struggle since it was first created is just now beginning to produce tangible results. In other words, the Department now hassomething &quot; to sell &quot; and I recommend that the time has come when it could withgreat advantage strengthen its publicity arrangements.23. On the matters which I have mentioned in the three previous paragraphsand on several other less important but still serious questions of administration,there is no fundamental difference between my views and the ultimate objective of the Food Department. After carefully considering all such questions in thelight of my detailed discussions, both with the Hon. Member for Food (SirJwaia P. Srivastava) and with the Secretary of the Department. I have leachedthe conclusion that the total effect of all the suggestions which I might be ableto make with a view to improving administrative methods in India could not,in the course of a year or even two years, bring about a really substantial, improve-ment in the feeding of the people of India. It is for this reason that I havedecided to devote little space in this Report to the discussion of matters ofadministration.24. There is. howrever, one further question which perhaps falls within thescope of administration to which I must refer. I spent only three days (one ofwhich was a Sunday) in the Province of Bengal. There is obviously a risk informing decided views based on such a short contact with a staff which is clearlysuffering from overwork and from recent anxieties of the gravest possiblecharacter. Nevertheless, I feel bound to place on record the fact that I come tothe conclusion very reluctantly that the arrangements in the Province of Bengalare on the one hand, inadequate for the heavy task which must be performed if further disasters are to be avoided and, on the other hand, are such as do not secure the best results from, at any rate, some of the senior and qualified officersnow available. Having regard to the vulnerable position of the Province of bengal, the administrative arrangements there would have left me in a state of serious depression had it not been that I. in a confidential conversation withHis Excellency the Governor, quickly learned not only that he himself was fully informed on the subject but also that he was determined to bring about asubstantial improvement with as little delay as possible. In these circumstances,all that is necessary for me to do is to express the view that administrativechanges-are...urgently needed in this Province and that His Excellency should begiven every possible support and assistance in bringing them about.Utilisation of Indian Produced food grains.25. At every centre I visited, I inspected godowns (stores) and obtained the views of local persons, both official and non-official, as to the quality of the grain which is being distributed to rationed consumers. My first morning inIndia was spent in Karachi, where the rainfall is usually no more than 4 toG inches per annum, but this year it has been quite exceptional, amounting to asmuch as 25 inches in the first 8 months of the year. This unexpected and heavyrainfall has caused a considerable deterioration in grain stocks, owned by.the
Government of Sind, most of which are stored in the open. Stocks in Karachiowned by the Government of India, which are in charge of experienced traders,are being looked after as well as circumstances permit. There are, however,others owned by the Provincial Government of which this could not be said.Apart from the damage caused by the rain, considerable quantities of grain havereached Karachi from various parts of the Province in a condition which obviouslydid not justify valuable transport being used for their transfer. This was aneye-opener to me on my first morning in India. Wherever I have inspectedstocks which have reached deficiency areas from surplus areas, I have been impressed with the fact that for some reason or other the condition of such stocksis frequently not satisfactory. It is for this reason that I have pressed my view(see paragraph 21) that more use should be made of the technical knowledge and experience of food traders in the procurement, handling and custody of food-grains acquired for distribution in rationed cities and towns throughout India.26. Apart from the question of the quality and condition of foocigrainsbeing held by or on behalf of the Governments of Provinces and States, there is theimmensely important but very difficult question of the equitable distributionthroughout India of food grains produced in India. It will be admitted by every person with knoAvleclge that these supplies are at present by no means equitablydistributed. For example, the low rice ration in Cochin State has already been referred to in paragraph 15. In the neighbouring province of Madras, except inthe Malabar district, the rice ration is a full 16 ozs. per person per day, and in the punjab, wheat is rationed but rice is unrationed. and rationing has so far been extended to only three cities in the Provinces, viz., Lahore, Amritsar, andRawalpindi. The wheat ration in these cities is 1 lb. per head per day with an extra allowance for heavy workers, which category includes practically all menand women who can be regarded by any stretch of imagination as engaged in any kind of heavy employment. This extra allowance brings the normal 7 lbs. perweek up to 8 lbs. per week on the average for all rationed consumers. Moreover,some consumers must be eating a substantial amount of rice in addition to theirwheat ration. At one shop in Lahore, which from its appearance and stock onshelves obviously catered for well-to-do customers, I enquired how many bags ofwheat were sold for every bag of rice, and was informed after consultation betweenthe proprietor and his assistant that one bag of rice was sold for every two bags ofwheat. In Amritsar, I was informed that since rationing; got into its stride theworking stock of wheat- and flour (atta) had never been allowed to fall below 13weeks as compared with 21 weeks in Cochin.27. The comparison between the food position in Cochin State and in theProvince of the Punjab brings out clearly the fact that &quot; possession is nine points of the law.&quot; In other words, the people of the provinces and areas in whichfoodgrains are produced in excess of local requirements are generally speakingbetter fed, and their food requirements are more secure than is the case indeficiency areas.28. The Basic Plan was designed to adjust the supply position as betweensurplus and deficiency Provinces and States. Every effort is being made by theGovernment of India to carry out this Plan, and considerable progress has alreadybeen made in securing the co-operation and goodwill of both surplus and deficiencyProvinces. Nevertheless, the fact remains that in some surplus areas current consumption is considerably higher than the all-India average, whereas in other areas especially those in which tapioca root, the nutritive value of which ispractically nil, is being consumed in large quantities because of the inadequacy ofthe rice supplies the health of the public is undoubtedly deteriorating throughinadequate and unsuitable feeding.29. To the question &quot;Is India making the best use of the food suppliesproduced within its own boundaries?&quot; the answer must be &quot; No.&quot; On the otherhand, it is one thing to observe and record a state of affairs: it is entirely adifferent thing to find practicable means for bringing about a radical improve-ment. I have given much thought to the possibility of the Central Governmentusing compulsory measures to bring about the transfer of a larger supply offood-stuffs from surplus to deficiency areas.* In some Provinces compulsion isbeing used.   In certain areas in Bombay Province, for instance, there is a.* I must emphasise the word area.&quot; In India it is nob merely that one Province acceptsno responsibility for what may be happening in another Province, but even within the sameProvince the inhabitants of a surplus area generally speaking see no reason why they shouldyield up their surpluses to save the citizens of a neighbouring town from starvation.
compulsory levy scheme. It is too early yet to say whether the results will be worth while. So far there has been no serious resistance from cultivators in theareas concerned. One thing- is, however, certain : generally speaking, whateverexperiments may be tried in deficiency Provinces, there is no prospect whatever of compulsion being used as a means of increasing the exports from those Provinceswhere the largest quantities of wheat and rice are produced. For example, thereis not the slightest prospect of coercive measures of purchase from cultivatorsbeing adopted by the elected Government of the Punjab, some members of whichhave stated that they are determined to protect the interests of cultivators duringthe present emergency. It is worthy of note that his Excellency the Governor of bengal, in spite of his experience in the Middle East, expressed to me without qualification the view that the use of compulsion in the Province of Bengal was quite unthinkable. This conclusion if I may say so has my wholehearted sup-port. Flow could the elected Government of this Province take away from smallsubsistence cultivators, who only a year ago witnessed deaths from starvation intheir immediate neighbourhood, small hoards of rice which the cultivators honestlyregard as the onlv thing in the world which secures them and their familiesagainst the risk of future starvation in the near future?30. If, as I submit, compulsion on a national or widespread scale is out ofthe question, there remains only persuasion. The Food Department has no reasonto be dissatisfied with the results which it has secured, since the publication of theGregory Report, by persuasion. Many months and indeed years would, however,be required before this method of itself could bring about in India equitable distribution of food grains between a self-sufficient area and an area in which it isimpossible to grow sufficient to meet the requirements of the local population. Inthis enormous country the method of persuasion must necessarily be slow in producing results. In the meantime, the problem of how to prevent disastersrecurring in Bengal and other parts of India remains. Until the risks can beremoved, some means must be found for dealing with a situation which at vervshort notice might again become dangerous. The margin for restricting foodconsumption in India is nowhere considerable, and among many millions of thepopulation there is no margin at all.Imports from Overseas.31. India is normallv a net importer of food grains. In spite of the efforts which have been made by Central and Provincial Governments to increase foodproduction throughout India, it is still necessary for imports to be received from overseas. The principal reasons why India has not been able to expand herproduction since imports were cut off so as to fill the relatively small gap betweendemand and supply are (a) that the necessary expansion in home production cannotbe secured so long as the present system of land tenure continues; (b) the increased consumption due to the transfer of men from civil life to the fighting services andto the increased purchasing power of the public generally, and particularly of thecultivators themselves; and (c) the natural increase of population which is under-stood to be at present at the rate of 5 millions per annum. &apos;32. There is, I submit, no doubt that India cannot be made self-supportingin food grains at any time during the next four or five years. The only issues,therefore, are what quantities of imports are necessary and by what means shouldthe flow of imports be regulated.33. The Gregory Committee recommended (a) that one million tons ofwheat should be imported annually for a period of five years, and (b) that in thefirst year half a million tons should be imported as a reserve. I cannot, from myknowledge of the way in which the world&apos;s exportable surpluses of foodstuffs arebeing controlled at the present time, endorse these recommendations of theGregory Committee. I am, however, satisfied that unless substantial quantitiesof wheat are brought into India from overseas the food position of India willbecome dangerous and create a situation of the utmost difficulty, both for theGovernment of India and for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.34. It is unfortunate that since the Gregory Report was published the par-ticular recommendations to which I have referred have become something like apolitical battle-cry in India. Wherever I went, these recommendations were quotedto me and used as a test of whether His Majesty&apos;a Government in the United King-dom are prepared to help the people of India or not. Even so, I do not recommendthat any announcement should be authorised to the effect that the recommendations
as they were put forward by the Gregory Committee have been accepted. To dealfirst with the second recommendation, I doubt whether, at the present time (and thesituation has changed a good deal since the Committee reported) it is necessary forthe Central Government to acquire a reserve of half a million tons of food-grains. The liability of the Central Government is to see that supplies are forth-coming for the Defence Services in India and for consumers in rationed cities and towns. At the present time considerable reserves of food-grains are being held forthese very purposes by the Army authorities, and by the Provincial Governments.In some deficiency Provinces the working stock is below the level of safety. this fact is appreciated by the Food Department, which will, I am sure, take steps to supplement those working stocks wherever necessary as soon as it is in a positionto do so. I see no reason for supplementing these reserves, which are for the mostpart located where they are likely to be required, by building up a large reserveunder the control of the Central Government. I consider, however, that the FoodDepartment should have a small working stock under its control for dealing withemergencies, such as the Bombay explosion. Hitherto, when comparatively smallimports have been received, the Food Department has allocated cargoes or partsof cargoes to individual Provinces as soon as or before the ship arrives in an indian port. I have recommended to the Food Department that if and whenimports begin to flow in adequate quantities and with fair regularity they should,whenever practicable, hold a cargo for their own account and thus build up a central working stock which is at present absent but badly needed.35. The question remains : &quot; What is the level at which wheat imports should arrive in India to supplement local production ? As I have already indicated, this question is to a large extent obscured in India by the fact that ithas become a political issue. The great majority of non-official people who have discussed the matter with me are not fully informed on the subject. They read inthe paper that a ship has unloaded 10,000 tons of Australian wheat in Calcuttaor Bombay. They regard this, and even the periodical announcements of largerallocations, as insignificant as compared with the million tons which India hasdemanded and they have little or no means of knowing whether in practice steps are being taken to provide India with a fair share of the world&apos;s exportable surplus or not.36. From many conversations which I had with politicians, representativesof the Press, and a large number of members of the public, I have formed the viewthat it is very desirable that a comprehensive announcement should be madeexpressing the views and intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom on the recommendations of the Gregory Report which deal with importsfrom overseas. In order to indicate what I have in my mind, I have drafted in theform of a reply to an arranged question in the House of Commons an announce-ment on the subject. This is set out in Appendix C to this Report. In preparingthis draft I have, of course, borne in mind not only the misunderstandings whichundoubtedly exist in India on the subject, but also the desirability of letting thepeople of the United Kingdom know in an authoritative statement what theGovernments of India and of the Provinces and States are doing at the presenttime in order to relieve the.food situation in that country.37. The draft announcement set out in Appendix C has been shown confidential -tially to the Secretary of the Food Department, the Hon. Member for Food,Sir Archibald Rowlands, his Excellency the Governor of Bombay, and hisExcellency the Viceroy. A number of verbal modifications have been made as aresult of suggestions received during the course of discussion. I put the draftforward, however, solely on my own responsibility, although it became clear to me from the conversations to which I have referred&apos; that a comprehensive statementof the kind I have prepared would, in the opinion of all persons consulted, go along way towards removing this question of the quantity of imports from overseasout of the political arena in India and would give to the public generally a feeling of confidence which is at present absent. The importance of the psychological effect of such an announcement on procurement and prices in surplus areas and on confidence generally would undoubtedly be very marked.38. Not unnaturally I have been questioned as to what figure or formula Ishould recommend to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom if I were asked on my return to London to express my own personal views on this matter.It has been put to me that, while an announcement of the kind suggested would almost certainly do a great deal of good in India, it must be contemplated that atsome stage or other the Secretary of State for India will be asked, in effect:[28348] c
&quot;What does this announcement really mean in terms of tons of imports?&quot;Naturally, I have given this question a great deal of consideration and I expressmy own personal views in regard to it in the following two paragraphs.39. In view of all the uncertainty that must exist, such as the demands of liberated Europe on overseas supplies, the shipping tonnage that may be availablefor the transport of grain to India, the size of the exportable surplus likely to beavailable in future from Australia, the production of future harvests in Indiaitself, I recommend that no undertaking in terms of figures should be givencovering a period of 12 months, still less a period of 5 years. The import requirements of India should be kept under constant review, and modificationseither up or down should be made in the import programme in accordance withthe best estimates which can be framed of future requirements. This is approxi-mately the procedure which has been adopted during the last 12 months, but thereasons for this procedure are not understood in India and, in my opinion, will notbe properly understood unless a comprehensive statement on the subject isauthoritatively made.40. In order to reduce my personal recommendations as regards tonnage todefinite form I submit the following draft supplementary question and reply which might follow the main Question and Answer as set out in Appendix C :  Question.&quot; While welcoming my Rt. Hon. Friend&apos;s announcement, may I ask whether he could add to it by stating what is the amount of the imports of wheat intoIndia which have been authorised or will be authorised in the immediate future ? &quot;A answer.&quot;Yes, Sir. In the future it is proposed to regard the twelve months, the1st May to the 30th April, as being the most satisfactory year for this purpose.My Hon..Friend is aware of the arrangements which were made covering a periodof six months, the 1st April to the 30th September. 1944, for which imports of400,000 tons of wheat were authorised. Consideration has been given to therequirements of the remaining three months of the calendar year, namely, the1st October to the 30th December. For this period a total of 300,000 tons has been authorised. For the first four months of 1945 imports will continue at the rate of70,000 tons per month, making a total of 980,000 tons for the thirteen months, the1st April, 1944, to the 30th April. 1945. The rate of imports will be reconsiderdtowards the end of the period in the light of circumstances as they then obtain,and particularly having regard to the size of the Rabi harvest in India next spring. I may add that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to do everything in its power to regulate the arrival of food-grains into India at a uniform monthly level which it is understood will be welcomed by the Governmentof India from the administrative point of view.&quot;41. I feel quite satisfied that if wheat imports arrive in India up to the30th April next to the level suggested in the above draft reply they will besufficient to enable the Central Government to fulfil its obligations up to that date.Already prices of wheat and rice are falling in India and there is a general indication of increase of confidence. If the position of the Food Department isstrengthened by the announcement which I have recommended, I have little doubtthat its status and influence throughout India will, during the next six months,be noticeably increased to the great benefit of consumers.Acknowledgments.42. In concluding this Report I should like to place on record my deepappreciation of all the arrangements made by the Government of India, throughthe Food Department, in connection with my tour. The programme had been most carefully thought out before I reached India, and after my arrival every possible step was taken to enable me to make the maximum use of the time at mydisposal. I would, in particular, like to express appreciation of the arrangement made by the Food Department for relieving Mr. W. H. J. Christie, O.B.F., I.C.S.,from his normal duties so as to enable him, during the period I spent in India,to devote the whole of his time to business arising out of my tour. Heaccompanied me throughout and his knowledge of India, of the policy and workof the Food Department, and of the individual Provinces and States was quiteinvaluable to me.
43. I would also like to put on record the generous treatment which I havereceived from the Hon. Member for Food (Sir Jwala P. Srivastava, K.B.E.) andthe Secretary of the Food Department (Mr. P. H. Hutellings, C.M.G., C.I.E.,I.C.S.). The former has throughout been most helpful and encouraging; thelatter has devoted many hours to discussion with me personally, which has been of enormous benefit to me in enabling me to grasp in a short time the essential features of a very complicated and difficult situation.44. I also acknowledge with great appreciation the assistance which I havereceived from my Private Secretary, Miss W. E. Munns. She has relieved methroughout of an immense amount of detailed work. While I have been talkingto Ministers and senior officers, she has often been talking to other officers, andby that means we have together obtained a more complete picture of the situationin the different places visited than I could have done by myself.45. I hope that the senior officers responsible for food administration, both at the Centre and in the Provinces, have derived some encouragement andstimulation from my visit. Whatever may be the position in this respect, I leftIndia deeply in their debt.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.(i) While there are reasons for thinking that some improvements in foodadministration in India may result from my visit, changes of an administrativecharacter cannot of themselves bring about in the next year or two any worthwhileimprovements in the feeding of the people of India (paras. 19-24).(ii) The use of compulsion to obtain supplies of food grains from theProvinces which produce large surpluses must be ruled out as impracticable(paras. 29-30).(iii) As India cannot be made self-supporting in food grains during the next four or five years, it is desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom should make at an early date a comprehensive announcement as to itsintentions respecting the import of wheat into India from overseas, which, atpresent, are not understood in India (paras. 32-41 and Appendix C).&apos;I am, Sir,Your obedient servant,HENRY FRENCH.APPENDIX A.List of people with whom Sir Henry French had discussions during his tour.His Excellency the Viceroy.(Field-Marshal the Right Hon.

APPENDIX C.Question.To ask the Secretary of State for India if he is in a position to make astatement as to the present situation in India in regard to food supplies anddistribution.A nsiver.The Government of India, acting in concert with, and through the agency of, the Governments of the eleven Provinces and of all the Indian States, are carrying out a co-ordinated policy based upon the recommendations of the food grains Policy Committee. This Committee, under the chairmanship ofSir Theodore Gregory, reported in September 1943 and recommended measuresto increase the production of food in India, for the procurement and transferof supplies from surplus to deficit areas and for the Defence Services, forthe statutory control of prices, and for urban rationing. Rationing offoodgrains is now well established in all the large centres of populationthroughout India in some of which areas sugar is also rationed. Rationing hasalso been extended in several Provinces to a large number of smaller towns, andin some cases a voluntary system of provisioning is in operation in villages and country areas. Price controls for cereals are in operation throughout the greaterpart of British India.2nd to 5th September.Calcutta.Visited relief home and  hospital  in 24 Parganas District;   inspectedrationing arrangements, stores and godowns in Calcutta.Met the Famine Enquiry Commission.Met members of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce.Qth and 7th September.Madras.Saw local rationing arrangements.

The Government of India recognise that in existing conditions of world supplies it is essential that effective arrangements should be made throughout India to ensure that the best use is being made of all food supplies produced inthat country. As my Hon. Friend will realise, the task before the Central and provincial Governments is a formidable one, but I am glad to be in a positionto assure the House that substantial progress has been made, and that food control is now established on a firm basis practically throughout the whole ofBritish India. The Central Government is determined to secure the equitable distribution of food grains, particularly wheat and rice, between surplus anddeficiency areas. Much, of course, still remains to be done, but the administrative( machinery which has been set up on the basis of the Fourth Food Conferenceheld in October 1943 is now, generally speaking, functioning effectively with theresult that the broad lines of policy recommended in the Gregory Report arenow in active operation.A key-point in those recommendations was, however, an assurance of cereal imports to replace those lost after the Japanese occupation of Burma, to meetincreasing current requirements and establish a reserve. I must admit that thesupplies which are now being provided under the rationing scheme in some large cities and elsewhere in India, from indigenous resources augmented by such imports as it has up to now been possible to arrange, are not such as to satisfy the Government of India or His Majesty&apos;s Government that an adequate dietis available to all classes of the people, even when allowance is made for the extentto which consumers are able to obtain unrationed commodities. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment has, after full discussion with the Government of India, reachedthe definite conclusion that it is essential that substantial quantities of food grains, which may be more or less than the quantities specified by the food grains Policy Committee, should be imported into India under Governmentauspices until such time as the world cereal supply position improves sufficiently to permit the restoration of importation through normal trade channels. the gap between India&apos;s essential requirements of food grains and the quantity ofindigenous produce which can be brought within Government control will, ofcourse, vary from year to year according to the size of local harvests and othervariable factors. The amount to be imported must, however, be calculated toplace stocks at the disposal of the Government of India adequate to enable themto forestall shortages and maintain control of prices. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill therefore, after all due consultation with the Government of India, putforward and support to the Combined Food Board organisation (through whichthe world&apos;s exportable surpluses are at present being allocated to the countriesin need of them) the reasonable requirements of India, as ascertained from yearto year, or, if necessary, at shorter intervals. His Majesty&apos;s Government willalso do everything in its power to ensure that the supplies of food grains allocated to India through the Combined Food Board organisation will be secured andtransported to Indian ports.In view of the notable advance in the control and the distribution of food-grains within India which has been achieved since the Gregory committee reported, coupled with the undertaking which I have now given in regard toimported supplies, I feel justified in assuring my Hon. Friend that everythingpracticable, is being done and will continue to be done to ensure that food control in India will not be wrecked during the next few years as a result of a shortageof reserves, and at the same time the essential requirements of the people ofIndia will be made available to consumers through the schemes of controlleddistribution now in operation.
