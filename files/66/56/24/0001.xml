THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET./    W.P. (44) 57.4.16th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.PUBLICATION OF STATISTICS ABOUT THE WAR EFFORT OFTHE UNITED -KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. At their meeting on the 6th October (L.P. (44) 47th Meeting, Minute 1)the Lord; Presidents Committee considered a proposal that a White Paper shouldbe published containing statistics giving a balanced picture of our war effortas a whole. The Committee approved the publication of a document of this kindas soon as possible, and agreed that, after the draft which they had had beforethem had been revised to take account of the points raised at,the meeting andof any further Departmental comments, it should be submitted to the War Cabinettogether with;a;statement of the views.of, the security authorities.2. I annex to this memorandum a proof of1 the revised. White Paper,prepared in the light of the discussion at the Lord Presidents Committee and ofthe comments&apos; from: Departments, which have since been received. I also give, inAppendix I, the detailed comments of the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee onthe draft.3. I would draw special attention to certain points of principle which:havebeen raised. Points (a)ttoi(c) ariose from comments made.on^the/draft by the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Joint. Intelligence Sub-Committee.(a) Publication of Merchant Shipping Losses.Paragraphs 54 to 56 of the draft White Paper contain figures: showingthe merchant shipping losses since the beginning; of the war. , The shipping situation has dominated to a large measure the mobilisation, of. our resourcesduring the war and the figures of losses bring out more clearly than anything else why the restrictions on imports and consumption of food and rawmaterials have been necessary. On the Other ;hand,,;the rFirst Lord of theAdmiralty and the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee feel that it is undesirable to publish these figures on the ground that, having so far beenable to keep both Germany and Japan in a state of ignorance of the resultsof their attacks, we should be ill advised to publish full figures now, at a timewhen there is a likelihood of renewed German attacks and when theinformation would give encouragement to Japan. The publication ofmonthly shipping losses was discontinued in July 1941 and all information was withheld up to June 1943. We then agreed with the United StatesGovernment that a monthly statement should be issued about the anti-U-boatcampaign giving a general indication of the trend of losses but no precisefigures. If the War-Cabinet-decide that we should now publish the figures,it will be necessary to consult the United States Government. for convenience of reference, I attach in Appendix II alternative versions of paragraphs 54 to 56. Version &quot;A&quot; shows the paragraphs as they nowappear in the draft:- version &quot;B&quot; as they would appear if figures ofmerchant shipping losses were omitted..--(b) Rechictions in Munitions Output in.1944.Owing to the concentration of our effort in the first half of 1944 onpreparations for the invasion of the Continent, there was a fall in the[28401] . copy No.     po 0
production of certain types of munitions (e.g., new naval vessels andordnance). There were also other reductions due to the switch over from one type of munition to another (e.,g., from medium and light bombers to heavy* bombers). The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee have suggested that there is a danger that the publication of thefigures for January to June 1944 may give the misleading impression thatour production effort has slackened off in these months. Against this, thereare naturally advantages in publishing figures up to the latest possible date,and the sentence at the end of paragraph 34 of the White Paper is designedto prevent any misunderstanding of this kind.(c) Lumping together of certain items of Production.The Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee have suggested that for securityreasons the figures relating to the production of naval vessels, merchantvessels and aircraft should show the different types of production in lessdetail. Perhaps my colleagues would authorise me to discuss this suggestionwith the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Aircraft Production.(d) Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid.Our Delegation in Washington, who are beginning this week the vitally important negotiations about Stage II, have pressed for the inclusion of ashort section dealing with Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid. As Lend-Lease hasadmittedly permitted us to turn over to fighting and war production an appreciable part of our man-power, and as Mutual Aid has put a burdenupon our productive machinery as a whole, such a reference is notinappopriate. The text of a suggested section has been telegraphed to washington, whose reply is expected immediately. If there is agreement inprinciple that such a section should be inserted, it would be convenient ifthe final text might be left for settlement between the Minister of Productionand myself.4. The publication of a White Paper on the lines proposed would, I am sure,do much to dispel the ignorance which prevails both in the United States and inother countries about the extent to which we have mobilised our resources for war.Our Delegation in Washington are strongly in favour of publication.5. If the War Cabinet approve the publication of the White Paper, special arrangements will be made to publish it simultaneously in the United States ofAmerica, and the Minister of Information will take appropriate steps to ensurethat full use is made of the material in it. I have asked our Delegation in washington whether, from the point of view of their negotiations, there is anyparticular period in the immediate future within which it would be most suitablefor the documents to appear.J.

Appendix I.DETAILED COMMENTS OF THE JOINT INTELLIGENCESUB-COMMITTEE.Paragraph 31, Table 9.It is suggested that the totals for landing craft and escort and mine-sweeping vessels, &amp;c, should be lumped together under the heading &quot;MinorVessels.&quot;Paragraph 34, Table 10.It is suggested that the columns relating to escort and minesweeping vessels,and landing craft completed, be amalgamated under the heading &quot;MinorVessels,&quot; and that the figures for January to June 1944 be deleted altogether.Paragraph 39.The Sub-Committee would prefer that the reference to production of heavy bombers and fighters in the first half of 1944 were deleted. If, however, it isconsidered essential to refer to the 1944 figures, some such phrase as &quot; There/was ageneral improvement in production figures for the first six months of 1944 &quot;should be used.Paragraph 39, Table 14.It is suggested that the 1944 figures be excluded altogether, both from thecolumn relating to production from January to June 1944, and from the columngiving totals from September 1939 to June 1944. It is suggested also that theproduction figures for aircraft in this table be condensed into the following catergories only :- :Heavy Bombers,Medium and Light Bombers,Fighters,Trainers and others.This proposal involves a consequential amendment to Table 9 where productionfigures should be given up to 1943 instead of up to June 1944.Paragraph 41.Here also it is suggested that the increase of engine output be given asbetween 1939 and 1943, rather than in the form as drafted, which gives theaverage monthly output between January and June, 1944.Paragraphs 54 and 55.The Sub-Committee would prefer that all reference to merchant shipping losses be deleted, and in particular that Table 20 be deleted.Paragraph 57, Table 21.It is suggested that the figures for non-tankers and tankers completed be amalgamated.Appendix II.ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THE PARAGRAPHS IN THE white paper RELATING TO MERCHANT SHIPPING.Version &quot;A &quot;as the paragraphs appear in the proof of the White Paper.&quot; 54. The size of the-ocean-going merchant fleet, including tankers, underthe British flag at the beginning of this war was 17-J million gross tons of vessels of 1,600 gross tons and over less than at the beginning of the last war. By themiddle of 1944, 11 million tons had been lost by enemy action, and a further million gross tons lost by marine risk and miscellaneous causes. To a largeextent these losses had been met by the production of 5 million gross tons ofmerchant ships in United Kingdom shipyards; by the chartering, temporarily, of[284011 &quot; b 2
merchant vessels from other countries; and by the purchase and acquisition ofmerchant ships from Canada and the United States. Nevertheless, losses haveexceeded gains and the size of the merchant fleet under the British flag at themiddle of 1944 was only 16f million gross tons. The size of the ocean-goingmerchant fleet on United Kingdom or Colonial registers has fallen by about 10 percent, since the beginning of the war, but some part of the reduced total may bereturnable to other flags or to Dominion registers.Shipping Losses.55. Figures of shipping losses by enemy action were published in the earliermonths of the war.

Losses of merchant ships from all causes were nevertheless severe from 1940 to the early monthsof 1943, rising to &quot;successively high levels during the different phases of the battle of the Atlantic. Losses were also increased by our operations in theMediterranean. Although losses in any month were never higher than in the worst periods of 1917-18 the attack on British shipping by U-Boats, mines and aircraft has been maintained at a high level for a longer period than in thelast war.

cTaTISTICS RELATING TO THE WAR EFFORT, OF TELE UNITED KINGDOMINTRODUCTIONUntil now it has not been possible, for reasons of security, to publishstatistics showing the extent to which the resources of the United Kingdomjuve been mobilized for war during the last five years. As a result of thechange in the military situation, however, it is no longer necessary to withholdSOIiie of this information and the Government has decided as a first step thatI (hose statistics which could be released immediately, without giving advantage,the enemy, should be published. Further information will be released assoon as circumstances permit, but it will be? realized that some statistics willl,ave to remain secret until the war with both Germany and Japan ends.The new statistics which the Government has decided to publish &quot;make it possible, for the first time, to present in summary form, a general picture of the way, the mobilization for war has been achieved.2, In studying these statistics it should be remembered that the vast re-organization of the British economy which the figures show has been carriedI through in particularly difficult living and working conditions. For five yearsmen and women have lived and worked under complete black-out. Familylife has been broken up, not only by the withdrawal of men and women tothe Forces, but by evacuation and billeting. Production has been made more difficult by the dispersal of factories to frustrate the air attacks of theenemy and by the need for training new labour to unaccustomed tasks.There have been two long p eriodg when work was carried on under constantand severe air attacks. Since 1940, if million men have given their limitedspare time, after long hours of work, for duty in the Home Guard. most other adult male civilians and many women have performed part-time civil defence and Fire Guard duties out of working hours.SECTION I-MAN-power. Between June 1939, and June 1944, the total number of men aged14 to 64 and of women 14 to 59. in the Services or in industrial employmentrose by 3! millions from 18J to 22 millions an increase of nearly one-fifth.This increase was achieved by (a) reducing the number of unemployed byij millions and (b) a net addition to the labour force of the country ofI i\ million persons not previously in industrial employment.4. In these figures, as throughout this Section, two women working part-time have been counted as equivalent to one whole-time worker. If the comparison between 1939. and 1944 had been made counting each womanworking part-time as equal to one whole-time worker and the comparisonhad covered men and women of all ages, the increase in the number in theServices or in industrial employment since 1939 would have been 4j millions:5. Of the total of 22 millions at the middle of 1944,47 per cent, or 10.3 millions were in the Services or whole-time civil defence or employed in engineering, shipbuilding, metals and chemicals industries mainly concerned in the output of munitions,26 per cent, or 5.7 millions were in agriculture, mining, national and localgovernment service, public utilities, transport (including the merchant navy), shipping and the manufacture of food, drink and tobacco,industries, which it has been necessary to maintain or expand duringthe war,27 per cent, or 6.0 millions were in the building,&quot; civil engineering, tex-tiles, clothing, other manufacturing industries, distributive trades&apos;, and civilian services.
6. At the middle of. 1944 7.6 million persons were engaged in the manuftufing industries (excluding mining), and of these ac&quot;76 per cent, were engaged on Government work;21 per cent, on work for the home market, and3 per cent, in producing goods for export.,In . 1939 about 15 per cent, of persons in the manufacturing indust&apos; -(excluding mining) were engaged in producing goods for export.  0        nes7. The.scale of mobilization of man-power achieved has:;-been far great,than was. attained in the&apos; last. war.   The number of men. and. women in services or. in industrial employment reached its highest.level.at the midd/of 1943, by which time labour was fully mobilized.   Since then thenumberin the. Services or in,industrial employment would.have been,,maintained,but!for the loss of men who became casualties .or were invalided -out of the ServiGes fancLwere unfit to take up industrial employment, and of women leaving induS. \try for domestic reasons.8 The needs of the Services have been met partly by voluntary, recruit-1ment but mainly by compulsory enlistment. of men registered ,under the national Service Acts. The compulsory enlistment of women in the.Women&apos;s IAuxiliary Services was introduced in December, 1941. Recruitment for indus-]try was largely on a voluntary basis until 1941, when compulsory, registration Ifor employment was introduced by the Registration for Employment Order, f1941 &apos; Ten million men born in the years.1892 to 1926 and 11.6.million.women Lborn in the years 1893 to 1926 have been registered for either military, service or industrial employment. In addition there have been registrations of per-jsons with special skill, such as coal miners ,and shipbuilders.Mobilization of ,men9. By the middle of 1944, 4&amp; million men were serving in the Armed Forcesof the United Kingdom compared -with less than half, a million-: at the beginningof the war. This total had; been reached in spite of the casualties sustainedduring five years of war. Including the number killed, missing, taken prisoner, or released on medical and other grounds, the total number of menwho have served or are serving in the armed forces of the United kingdom during this war is over 5^ millions.10. These men have been drawn mainly from the younger-age groups.57 per cent, of all men between the ages of 18 and 40 haye-served or-are;still serving in the Armed Forces.   The other men in these age groups havebeen retained in industry because of.special skill, particularly in making muni-tions, or because they were unfit for service in the armed forces.TABLE number of males aged 14-64 in Great BritainThousandsMid-year	Armed Forces (x)	- Whole-time Civil Defence	Industrial groups			Unern-ployed	Rest of ,.male popula-tlon(5)	Total male . popula-tion-age,d 14-64			Group I (?)

At the middle of 1944 about 900,000 women were doing part-timework and haye been counted half in this group and half in the appropriate industrial group.Domestic servants are also included in this column.15. The increase in the number of women in the Auxiliary Services or in industrial employment has been achieved by a reduction in the number un-employed by 271,000 and a net a-ldition of 2 million women not previously1in industrial employment.16. A great number of those who have taken up &quot;employment during-thewar are married women who arc doing industrial work in addition to their,domestic duties.     There has been transference on a very large .scale of&quot;women from.:the less essential industries to&apos;munitions work.-and to employ^ment in Group II industries.   Of those who entered industry durihg..,theHi In addition to those serving in the Armed Forces, a large number, i ofmen have been needed for whole-time Civil Defences, consisting of the national fire Service, A.R.P. Services, Casualty Services, Regular and&apos;Auxiliary Police.At the height of enemy air attacks in 1941 the number was 324,000; since then it has been reduced to 225,000 in June, 1944.ii Table 1 shows that while the numbers in the Armed Forces, whole-time civil Defence and the munitions industries have increased, the number em-ployed in other industries has been reduced.1 In 1944 the number of men engaged in the Group III industries was half of the corresponding pre-wartotal13. Of the total of 11.2 million men remaining in civilian life in the middle0f 1944 (excluding those in whole-time Civil Defence), if millions were givingpart-time service in the Home Guard and a further i  millions were doingpart-time Civil Defence work. Most of the remaining men were performing48 hours a month Fire Guard duties.Mobilization of women14. The high degree of mobilization achieved in this war has been largely due to the contribution made by, women. At the middle of 1944 out ofit million women aged 14-59, 7.1 millions were in the Auxiliary Services,whole-time Civil Defence or industry-an increase of over q,\ millions sincethe beginning of the war, or, counting each woman working part-timeseparately, an increase of nearly 2f millions. The remaining - 8.9 millionsconsist mainly of girls at school and of married women with domestic respon-sibilities such as the care of young children and of invalids, and housing-keeping for men and women engaged directly in the war effort. At themiddle of 1944, 900,000 worren were doing part-time work in industry, and350,000 were doing part-time Civil Defence work. Large numbers of marriedwomen are members of the Women&apos;s Voluntary Service and many performj8 hours a month Fire Guard duties in addition to industrial work.
war a large proportion have been drafted into the munitions and Groun ttindustries; the others, being immobile, have taken the place of men anHwomen who have been withdrawn from the industries primarily providin1U1     UJ. V J-J.iCJ.ii.- Table 3 shows how this mobilization has been achieved according toage groups between i939 and 1943. The majority of the women mobilizedhave been aged 18-40. Of the total number of single, married and widowedwomen in this age group, 55 per cent were in the Services or employed in industry in 1043. Women aged 41-59 have accounted for nearly 470,000 ofthe increase in the munitions and Group II industries, and nearly 300,000 inthe less essential industries and services, thereby allowing younger women tobe withdrawn for other work.

The numbers of persons employed in the engineering, metal and chemical industries in Great Britain at the beginning of the war was aboutthe same as that attained at the end of the last war. Since 1939 these industries have been engaged almost entirely on the output of munitions and warlike stores and, at the same time, have increased their labour force from 3 to 5 millions in the five years. This number is about equal to thetotal strength of the Armed Forces and whole-time Civil Defence. Most ofthe increase during the war has been achieved by the employment of women,although there has also been an increase in the number of men employed.The average hours of work, including overtime, in the munitions industries were 54 hours a week at the middle of 1944 compared with 47 hours beforethe war.

The total number employed by the three Supply Departments on ordersfor the Navy, Army and Air Force reached its highest level about themiddle of 1943. Since then there has been some reduction in order to buildup still further the strength of the Armed Forces for the military operations in 1944. The continued increase up to the beginning of 1944 in employment for the Admiralty and the Ministry of Aircraft Production was made possible by a reduction during 1943 in employment on orders for the Ministry of supply as the main requirements of Army equipment were fully satisfied and adequate reserves had been accumulated.Group II Industries21. The total number of persons employed in these industries has been generally maintained since the beginning of the war; but there has been asubstitution of women for men wherever possible. The number of men inthese industries fell by 600,000 and the number of women rose by 800,000between 1939 and 1944.Numbers employed in Group II industries in Great BritainTABLE 5__ Thousands	Mid-1939	Mid-1943	Mid-1944	Increase (4) or decrease (-) from 1939 to 1944Agriculture and             Males horticulture               Females Mining.........

Mobilization of man-power had gone further by the end of the fifthyear-of this war than in 1918. The total number of men in the Armed Forces in1944 was almost the same as in 1918, but there were more women.in the auxiliary Services and more men and women in whole-time Civil Defence.The number of men and women in the rnunitions industries was much larger than in 1918. Although separate detailed figures for the industries producingcivilian goods, building, and distribution are not available for 1918 it is certain that the cuts in man-power in these industries have.been much more severe than in the last war.Other industries and services (Group III)22. These industries have suffered the greatest reduction in their labour force a decrease of one-third since 1939. They have -provided more than half the number of men recruited to the Armed Forces as well as large numbersof men and women for transfer to the munitions industries.23. It. is estimated that half the total in the manufacturing industries inGroup III are.employed on Government orders, excluding, of course, utilityclothing, and . other Government sponsored schemes. The proportion for individual industries in .1943 was as follows:  -        cent,.Textiles.......    ..:      _____    ....     .......      ...     ^q,Cldthing      ......... ...      ... :   ...      ...     39Boots and shoes    ...      ...................      20Other manufactures ...      ...      ...      ......      ...      ^Q24. A decrease of 52 per cent, in the numbers employed in building and civil-engineering has occurred between 1939 and 1944, notwithstanding theincrease in vital work such as airfield construction and the building of barracks(both for British and American Forces), A.R.P. defences and new warfactories.

To equip the Fighting Services of the British Commonwealth and empire and the Allied Forces dependent on us for supplies, to providesubstantial assistance to Russia, and to assist other Allies, a big expansionhas been necessary in the production of munitions. It is estimated that the monthly output of munitions&apos; in the United Kingdom in the first half of1944 was about 6 times as great as at the outbreak of war: This increaserelates to the over-all rate of production of naval and merchant vessels, air-craft, ground equipment, other munitions and warlike stores.31. The production of some of the principal items is shown in Table 9.Production of munitions by the United KingdomSeptember 1939 to June 1944TABLE 9NumberNaval Vessels *Major naval vessels     ............Escort and minesweeping vessels, etc.Mosquito naval craftLanding craftGround EquipmentField, medium and heavy artillery equipmentsHeavy anti-aircraft equipmentsLight anti-aircraft equipments......     ......Tank and anti-tank guns        .........Machine guns and sub-machine guns......Rifles ......      ....     ......Tank chassis&apos;    ...............Wheeled vehicles for the Services   ......AircraftTotal aircraftHeavy bombersMedium and light bombers ...Fighters3828291,3863,14713,5126,29415,32484,8833,672,6022,001,94925,116919,111102,61110,01818,39538,02532. The United Kingdom has been the principal source of supply of the munitions required by the British Commonwealth and Empire Forces, thoughlarge quantities of equipment ihave been made in the British Dominions andIndia and supplies have been received from the United States, both against british cash purchases and under Lend-Lease.33. Of the total supply of munitions produced by, or made available tothe British Commonwealth and Empire since the beginning of the war, it is
estimated that rather more than seven tenths has been produced in theUnited Kingdom v/hile about one tenth has come from other Empire countries^-making about four filths from British Commonwealth and Empire sources.The greater part of the remaining fifth of the Empire supplies has come fromthe United States. Of this American contribution one quarter has taken the form of British cash purchases and three quarters the form of Lend-Lease.These figures relate only to the production of munitions and merchantvessels. They do not take into account work performed on the constructionof aerodromes and military bases nor the provision of food and raw materials.All shipping services, as distinct from construction, of merchant vessels,have been excluded. naval construction34. The effort in naval construction has been fourfold: to increase the offensive fleet in the face of heavy losses and the need for faster vessels, witharmament and other equipment vastly more complicated than that fitted inthe early stages of the war; to build the large numbers of escort vessels needed to protect our vital ocean communications; to provide the large numbers ofsmall patrol and other craft necessitated by the enemy invasion of Franceand the Low Countries and the progress of operations in the Mediterranean;and finally to provide the landing craft required for combined operations.The vital need for aircraft and army equipment after the earlier Germansuccesses necessarily limited the manpower available for shipbuilding, andthis was also diminished by the large number of men required for the refitand repair of ships continuously at sea and frequently in action. Moreover,the fact &quot;that in 1944 a greater effort had to be concentrated on the refittingand repair of vessels in connection with preparations for the invasion ofEurope and the Far Eastern war has meant that the rate of new productionof certain types of vessels and armaments has necessarily fallen.TABLE 10 United Kingdom naval construction	Major war vessels completed		Escort and minesweeping vessels completed^)		Mosqui comp	:o craft leted	Landir comp	g craft leted	Number	Tonnage	Number	Tonnage	Number	Tonnage	Number	Tonnage1939 Sept-Dec. 1940  ... 1941   ... 1942   ... 1943  ... 1944 Jan.-June	13 52 72 115 91 39	19,740 170,043 247,888 246,485 209,095 92,130	9 96 166 142 219 197	5,705 75,889 158,150 93,887 134,275 76,109	2 121 395 405 337 126	81 7,057 37,743 46,237 45,985 14,607	A 158 246 521 1,459 759	78 9,929 34,899 108,279 250,771 168,216(&apos;) Including certain miscellaneous craft not appropriate to the other categories.35. The increase in ships has called for an even greater increase in navalmunitions. It is now necessary to arm regular warships with many offensive and defensive weapons additional to those fitted in the early stages of the war.Moreover, much additional equipment is require-d in the way of radar and wireless apparatus, control gear and devices for protection against the various forms of enemy attack, including surface craft, U-Boats, aircraft and minesot the magnetic and other types. In addition practically every merchant ship must be equipped with complete defensive armament including many ofthe weapons and devices fitted in war vessels.

(J - -SEX38. Production of munitions for the ground forces rose steadily from theoutbreak of war until early 1943. The figures given in Tables 12 and 13 donot, however, give a complete picture of the expansion in production whichhasi taken, place, for, over thcperiod. there :have been,(marked, changes inthe types of equipment produced. In the case of tank; and anti-tank guns,2-pounders gave place to 6-pounders and they, later, were replaced by17-pounders. Ammunition not only grew in weight but also became more complicated and difficult to make. Fighting vehicles now are. heavier andmore highly powered than they were; and wireless sets and other types ofsignal equipment have become much more elaborate. A wide range ofspecialized stores, sometimes., of: a very bulky, character have been made&apos; tofacilitate the landings in Western Europe.

4o. The repair of aircraft has absorbed an appreciable proportion of the capacity of the industry. For every six aircraft newly produced in 1943,four aircraft were repaired in the United Kingdom by the Civilian- RepairOrganization. *41. Because of the change to larger, multif-engined types of aircraft theexpansion in the output of aero-engines and other aircraft components hashad to be even greater than that achieved for airframes. Engine outputincreased from 1,130 a month at the end of 1939 to an average of 5,280 amonth between January and June 1944. Over the same period the averagehorse-power of engines produced was doubled.42. Bomb loads increased with the size and power of- the bombers pro-duced. In 1939 the average bomb load was 1.2 tons per bomber&apos; in 1943it was 4.0 tons. The weight of bombs which could be carried a distance of1,000 miles by the monthly output of bombers increased from 210 tons inI939 to more than 3,000 tons at the beginning of 1944. These figures donot include the bomb carrying capacity of fighters which was much developedover the period. . rRaw materials43. One of the important problems facing the Government during thewar has been to meet the demand of the. munition and other industries, for essential raw materials and, at the same time, to economize in the use of imported raw materials and semi-finished products. This has been particu-larly important in the case of the iron and steel industry which had previouslyrelied on large imports of iron ore. To this end the home output of iron ore has been increased by more than one-half since before the war. In spiteof the fact that this has meant using low-grade home ore instead of highrgrade imported ore, the output of pig iron has been maintained at a high level. The total steel production has been consistently above the pre-waraverage, notwithstanding the need to increase greatly the proportion of alloyand high-grade steels produced, so limiting the increase in imports which the activity of the munitions industries would otherwise have made necessary.Another substantial contribution to the domestic supply of steel has been madeby a severe curtailment of our exports of steel products.44. In order to save shipping, salvage of many kinds of scrap and wastehas been intensified ,and the collection of iron and steel scrap is nearly one-third larger than before the war. Substantial&apos; savings in shipping spacehave also been obtained not only by severe restriction of consumption butalso by the increased home production of timber which in &quot;1943 was morethan four times as great as at the outbreak of war.45. Some of the most outstanding increases in production have been madeby the light metals industry to meet the., requirements of aircraft and incendiarybomb production. Magnesium production is more than eleven times thepre-war rate an achievement which has meant the creation of virtually anew industry. ......46. In some industries output has been reduced in order to save labouror the shipping space required for the import of raw materials. Thus, in1943 the output of newsprint was only 15 per cent, of what it was in 1935and cotton yarn output was about 60 per cent, of its pre-war amount.

The dominant aim of agricultural production during the war has been to increase the domestic output of food and so save shipping space. In theUnited Kingdom, unlike many other countries, there was very little scope for doing this by increasing the area of cultivated land, i for almost allcultivable land was already in agricultural use. Reclamation of waste land has played, therefore, only a comparatively minor part in the drive to increaseagricultural output, and the area of land reclaimed and brought into cultiva-tion has, in fact, been more than offset by losses of farm land to military andother non-agricultural uses. &apos; The problem has, therefore, been to increasethe output of human food on the existing land of a country where production was already of an intensive character. This has been done in two ways:-by increasing the actual physical yield of the land (largely by ploughing up grassland) and by increasing the proportion of crops available for directhuman consumption.TABLE 16Use of agricultural&apos;land in the United KingdomMillion acres	Land under the plough				Total aresJune				Permanent grassland	under crops and grass	Crops and fallow	Temporary grassland	Total		1939   ...... 1940   ...... 1941   ... 1942   ...... 1943   ...... 1944   ......	8-8 10-5 12-7 13-7 14-5 14-6	4-1 3-9 3-5 3-8 .4-2 4-8	12-9 14-3 16-2 17-5 18-7 19-4	18-8 17-1 15-1 13-7 12-3 11 7	31 7 31-4 31-4 31-2 31-0 31 -home production of some essential Industrial materials^) Thousand tons
48. The production of wheat, potatoes, sugar beet and vegetables for human consumption have all been velry substantially indreased. In 1943 thequantity both of^wheat and of potatoes harvested, for example, was morethan&apos;double the pre-war average, while increases of more than 30 per cent.were achieved in the output of sugar beet and vegetables. To alleviate the shortage caused by the reduction in imports of animal feeding-stuffsincluding the by-products of imported materials (which before the waramounted to about 8  million tons and in 1943 had fallen to less than iimillion tons), larger quantities of fodder crops have been grown at home,mainly to maintain the production of milk. The output of meat, poultry and eggs has, however, had to be curtailed considerably&apos;. ^49. It has been estimated that the net output of human food from british agriculture has increased by at least 70 per cent, in terms both of caloriesand of protein. The outcome of this agricultural production programme,coupled with the control of food distribution was that, by 1943, it had become possible to maintain our total food supplies at an adequate levelwhile at the same time reducing imports of food by 50 per cent., thus releasingan equivalent amount of shipping for other war purposes. This has beenaccomplished in spite of the loss of about 100,000 regular male workers.An extremely important part in the food production programme has beenplayed by the Women&apos;s Land Army, the enrolled strength of which was over80,000 at the middle of 1944. In addition, farmers have been assisted byschoolboys and adult volunteers who have spent their holidays on the land.Estimated quantity of principal crops harvestedTABLE 17 Thousand tons	Wheat	Barley	Oats	Potatoes	Sugar beet	Vegetables	FruitAverage 1936-38 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 Percentage	1,651 1,645 1,641 2,018 2,567 3,449 109	765 892 1,104  . 1,144 1,446 1,641 115	1,940 2,003 2,892 3,246 3,553 3,059 58	4,873 5,216 6,404 8,010 9,393 9,822 102	2,741 3,529 3,176 3,226 3,924 3,760 37	2,384 2,428 2,687 2,974 3,806 3,197 34	455 836 580 326 762 705 55increase since 1936-1938							50. An intensive drive has also been made to encourage production in private gardens and allotments, through the &quot; Dig for Victory &quot;. campaign.The number of allotments has increased from about 800,000 before the war to about i  millions in 1943 and there has been a large increase in thegarden area devoted to vegetable production; with the result that privategardeners have themselves produced a substantial proportion of the vegetablesso essential for the maintenance of health and working efficiency.51. The reduction in imports of animal feeding-stuffs and the diversion of cereals to human consumption has brought about an inevitable declinein the number of sheep, pigs and poultry. Efforts have been made to increasethe number of dairy cows to offset the decline in milk yields per cow whichhas resulted from the lack of imported feeding-stuffs. The number of otherkinds of cattle has been largely maintained.37982 b

During the war two-thirds of the deep-sea trawler fleet and nearly three-quarters of the steam-drifter fleet have been requisitioned for navalpurposes, as well as&apos; many of the motor vessels engaged in inshore fishing.As a result the total landings of fish of British taking on an average throughoutthe war has amounted to less than one-third of what it was in 1938.Landings of Fish of British takingTABLE 19 Thousand cwts.Calendar year193819391940194119421943Total landings^)20,90715,6876,2684,9046,0916,175(*) Landings of demersal fish (white fish) and pelagic fish (herrings, etc.).SECTION III-SHIPPING AND FOREIGN TRADE53. The character of the war has made great demands on the use of ourlimited shipping resources. Since the close of the campaign in France in 1940and the e&quot;ntry of Italy and later of Japan into the war, the British Common-wealth and Empire Forces have had to be supplied over very long shippingroutes. The opportunities the enemy has had to attack our merchant shipping have been greater than in the last war and each successive campaign Libya,Tunisia, Sicily, Italy and France has necessitated large demands for shipping for military purposes.54. The size of the ocean-going merchant fleet, including tankers, under theBritish flag at the beginning of this war was 17J million gross tons of vessels of 1,600 gross tons and over less than at the beginning of the last war. [Bythe middle of 1944, 11 million tons had been lost by enemy action, and a further
1 iOShipping losses   -55. Figures of shipping losses by enemy action were published in the earliermonths of the war. The figures given in Table 20 relate to vessels of alltonnages lost by enemy action and all other causes.TABLE 20Losses of merchant ships from all couses(1)(Vessels of all tonnages)1939 Sept.to Dec.1940 ...1941  -1942  ...1943 ...1944 Jan.to JuneBritishNumber15872889278236193I housandgross tons4982,7253,0473,6951,678228AlliedNumber1720134498738897Thousandgross tons908221,2994,3941,886454NeutralNumber148416183906336Thousandgross tons3471,0023472498226TotalNumber3231,3451,4191,859812226Thousandgross tons9354,5494,6938,3383,646808(&apos;) The figures of losses relate to the period in which the losses occurred and are as recordedat the middle of September, 1944.   They include losses by enemy action and marine risk.56. At the beginning of the war convoy and other defensive measures for theprotection of shipping were introduced without delay. Losses of merchant ships from all causes were nevertheless severe from 1940 to the early monthsof 1943, rising to successively high levels during the different phases of the battle of the Atlantic. Losses were also increased by our operations in theMediterranean. Although losses in any month were never higher than in the worst periods of 1917-1918 the attack on British shipping by U-Boats, mines and aircraft has been maintained at a high level for a longer period thanv inthe last war. Shipping has, in addition, been subjected to attack by new weapons that did not then exist.Merchant shipbuilding57. The tonnage of merchant vessels constructed in the United Kingdom inthe years 1940 to 1943 averaged nearly one-fifth more than in the years 1915 to1918. Many of these vessels were of types specially designed to meetparticular operational and other war needs, such as carrying and lifting very37982 B2  -one million gross tons lost by marine risk and miscellaneous causes.] To alarge extent these losses had been met by the production of 5 million gross tons0f merchant ships in United Kingdom shipyards; by the chartering, temporarily,of merchant vessels from other countries; and by the purchase and acquisitionof merchant ships from Canada and the United States. Nevertheless, losses have exceeded gams and the size of the merchant fleet under the British flagat the middle of 1944 was only i6f million gross tons. The size of the ocean-going merchant fleet on United Kingdom or Colonial registers has fallen byabout 10 per cent, since the beginning of the war and some part of the reducedtotal may be returnable to other flags or to Dominion registers

Out of the reduced total of British shipping available during 1942 and1943, a considerable amount was allocated to the Fighting Services either astroopships, naval commissioned vessels or for carrying military stores. More-over, a substantial proportion of the ships available are always temporarilyidle because they are undergoing repairs as a result of damage due to enemy action or marine risk. Shipping has also had to be allocated to meet theessential needs of British Empire and Allied countries. The greatest economyhas&apos;, therefore, been needed in every way, not only in speeding up the move-ments and turn-round times of the ships available, but in bringing into theUnited Kingdom only those foodstuffs and raw materials and manufactureswhich have been considered necessary for the war efforft and for meetingessential civilian requirements.Total imports59. In view of this shortage of shipping, imports of dry. cargo into theUnited Kingdom had to be drastically curtailed. In the five years beforethe war imports (excluding petroleum and other tanker-borne products),averaged 55 million tons a year; in 1942 they had fallen, to 23 million tons andin 1943 were 26 million tons less than one-half of what they were before thewar. Imports of both food and raw materials were cut by one-half and imports of finished goods were confined almost exclusively to munitions.Imports in 1942 and 1943 were less than in 1917, when they were nearly34 million tons of dry cargo, and in 1918 when they were 30 million tons. in both these years of the last war we were faced with serious shortages of food and raw materials and stocks of wheat had fallen to a critically low level.heavy and awkward cargoes, and were not adaptable to methods of mass con-struction. As in the case of naval vessels, war experience called for an in-creasing complexity of armament and special equipment. This programme^ ^r,-rr;0A rintin ebite of the heavy demands of essential naval shipbuildingthe difficulties of the blackout and the very large volume ot repair work of allkinds. Repairs to merchant vessels absorbed more than half the manpoweravailable for merchant work; this was due to damage caused not only by enemy action, but also by the abnormal weather met with in the high latitudesfrequented by convoys to and from North America and Russia. At one period the amount of merchant shipping in hand for repair was over z\ million gross tons.New merchant vessels completed in the United Kingdom -

See Table 24.Imports of foodfjo. Table 23 sets out in more detail the cuts made in imports of food andanimal feeding-stuffs to the United Kingdom during the war. Imports of wheat and flour have been  reduced by, over one and a half million tons a year; a sub-stantial cut has been made in the amount of sugar brought in and imports of fruit and vegetables in 1943 were less than one-eighth of their pre-war level,the most striking economies have been achieved in the case of animal feeding-stuffs. Imports of maize and maize meal and certain other animal feeding-stuffs have dropped from an average of 5.1 million tons a year before the war to insignificant quantities in 1943. This does not take into account a similarfall in the import of barley, oats and other grains and the by-products of imported materials used in substantial quantities for feeding animals. On theother hand, every effort was made to maintain imports of oilseeds and fats(for the manufacture of margarine and compound lard) to offset the fall in supplies of butter; and of meat to replace the reduced home production.Imports of food and animal feeding-stuffs to the United Kingdom(excluding imports from Eire)TABLE 23 Thousand tons	Average 1934-38	1940	1941	1942	1943	Jam-June 1944Wheat and flour Rice, other grains and pulses......

Economies in imports necessitated bythe shipping situation during the war have had to be maue mainly 111 thesetwo groups of materials.62 Imports of steel and steel-making materials as a whole were maintained in the first two years of the war to meet the expanding requirements of the munition industries, but by 1943 they had been cut to about 3 million tonsbelow their pre-war level. The -greatest economy in shipping was obtained by reducing imports of iron ore and scrap, while importing more finishedand semi-finished steel. ; &apos;63. In the early years of the war imports of timber were cut drastically frornan average of 9! million tons before the war to just about 4 million tons in1940. As the shipping position worsened imports of timber were cut stillfurther to less than 2 million tons.Imports of rawmaterials into the United Kingdom^)TABLE 24 (excluding imports from Eire)   _Thousand tons

Substantial cuts were also made in imports of wood pulp, newsprint andper, while imports of raw materials for the textile industries also declined.On the other hand, imports of aluminium for aircraft and copper for munitionswere substantially increased.Exports65. During the first two years of war it was necessary to keep up our exports in order to pay for imports of food, raw materials and munitions neededfrom abroad. Since 1941, however, the financial aid received from the UnitedStates and Canada and the agreement of the Empire countries to leave balances in London has permitted exports to be &quot;reduced and man-power thereby to be diverted to other purposes.66. The value of United Kingdom commercial exports has fallen- from  471million in 1938 to  232 million.

With a larger number of persons in employment or in the Services,increased hours of work and higher money earnings, the total income of private persons before taxation rose from  4,779 millions to  7,708 millions between1938 and 1943. Most of this increase in income has, however, been saved ortaken by the Government in the form of income tax and other direct taxes.The proportion of personal incomes paid in income tax and other direct taxeshas increased from one-tenth in 1938 to one-sixth in 1943. The rise in personalsavings has been even more striking; whereas in 1938 savings made out of personal incomes were only about 3 per cent., almost one-fifth was saved in1943- -*    &apos;^ Exports from the United kingdom table 26

The actual amount spent on current goods and services by private persons rose as Table 28 shows from  4,138 millions to  5,049 millions between1938 and 1943. The whole of this increase, however, was due to a rise inprices and to increased indirect taxation paid in the form of beer, spirits and tobacco duties, purchase tax and other &quot;indirect taxes. It is estimated thatthe quantity of all goods and services purchased (including food, rent, fuel andtravel) has fallen by 21 per cent, since 1938. It should be emphasized thatthis figure of 21 per cent, is a measure of the reduction in the quantity of goods and services purchased and&apos; does not take full account of the deterioration in quality. The main cuts in civilian consumption were made in the first twoyears pf the war and consumption has been maintained at this reduced levelduring the following three years.TABLE 28Personal expenditure on current goods and servicesCalendar years	Personal expenditure on current goods and services at market prices (L)	Indirect taxes specifically on consumption less subsidies	Personal expenditure on current goods and services excluding indirect taxes and increased by subsidies	Index of personal expenditure oh consumption at constant prices&apos; 1938 ... 1939 ... 1940 ... 1941 ... 1942 ...	  million 4,138 4,244 4,376 4,624 4,925	  million 424 469 518 637 ^ 764	  million 3,714 3,775 3,858 3,987 4,161	100 100 88 82 811943 ...	5,049	883	4,166	79				(&apos;) Including personal expenditure involved in the acquisition and transfer of property ande assurance ( 68 million in 1943).Personal Income, direct taxes and savings
Food70 Considerable changes have taken place during the war in the pattern of civilian food consumption. Meat and bacon, butter, margarine, and cookine&apos;fats cheese, tea, sugar and preserves are rationed; distributions of eggs and milk is controlled in order to ensure preferential supplies to priority classes of consumers and the equitable sharing out of the remainder; tinned goods andmany other foods (such as dried fruit, breakfast cereals, nee, biscuits) arerationed on a points system; chocolate and sugar confectionery are on a separatepersonal points system; fish, though not rationed, is scarce; supplies of fruithave dropped by one-half. During the war the United Kingdom has had to depend mainly &quot;on supplies from the home crop of fruit except for oranges,in consequence during considerable periods of the year fresh fruit is very scarce.Potatoes, other vegetables and bread are the only staple foodstuffs inunrestricted supply. Generally speaking, the United Kingdom has increased itsconsumption of bulky and starchy foods, and is eating less meat, fats and sugar,Total consumption of milk and cheese has been increased.71 The&quot; nutritive value of the country&apos;s total food supplies has fallenslightly between 1938 and 1943 hut rationing and other measures have tended to reduce the inequalities in food consumption which existed before the war.Civilian consumption of principal foodstuffsTABLE 29 Per head per week		Unit		1934 38 average	1940		1941	1942	1943Butter............      ...

The figures of- consumption per head given in Table 29 include foodbought for household use, food used in catering establishments (hotels,restaurants, canteens, etc.) and quantities used for food manufacture. Theyaiso include food produced by people for their own consumption, as forexample, pork and bacon, eggs, and fruit and vegetables produced in gardensand allotments. For this reason the figures are greater than the domesticrations. The figures of consumption of meat and bacon are measured at the wholesale stage and so include the weight of bone, some of which is removed&apos; before sale on the domestic ration.73. Food consumed by British, American and other Allied Forces on leavein hotels and restaurants and in private houses cannot be distinguished fromcivilian consumption and the figures given in the table therefore slightly over-state the actual consumption by civilians.74. The increase in the consumption of liquid milk has not been&apos;enjoyed byall consumers&quot;.; Milk supplies must first satisfy the higher demands of priorityconsumers (children, pregnant women and nursing mothers) and the allowance for the non-priority consumer during the winter months of the last three yearsfell to only 2 pints a week. The fall in&apos;the consumption of shell eggs has been substantially made good by increased supplies of dried eggs, but the ordinaryconsumer, who would prefer shell eggs, received only 30 eggs in 1943 as a registered customer.Non-food consumption75. Table 30 shows how, during the period of the war, expenditure on various categories of goods has moved after allowance has been made for the increasein prices. The figures, therefore, provide an index of changes in the&quot;quantity &quot; of consumption.
groups of clothing and footwear.rather I^cq HuraHle and mnro ficIn all these categories the reductions havebeen severe and the reduced rate of consumption has&quot; only been possible by the ,existence of stocks which after five years of war are becoming exhausted.77 Table 31 gives figures in physical units for a number of items for which 1comparative pre-war and current statistics can be given; unfortunately, infor. Imation on this basis exists only for a limited range of goods.78 Clothes rationing was introduced in the middle of 1941 and the present Iration provides adults with about one-half of the average pre-war consumption. IIt only allows a man who does not receive an industrial supplement to buy Ione pair of boots, shoes or slippers in about 13 months on the average, and a Ihousewife one pair in 8 months. Women&apos;s purchases of stockings are limited Ito 5 or 6 pairs a year instead of 14, and the supply of fully fashioned stockings Iis very small. The size of the present clothes ration is barely adequate to I,cover even the minimum requirements of adults and has brought about&apos;a Iconsiderable deterioration in the state of their wardrobes. The reduction Iimposed on purchases for children has not been so great. In particular, the Ioutput of leather footwear for children has been maintained; but they have lost 1nearly all the pre-war supply of plimsolls and rubber-soled sports shoes.TABLE 31Supplies of articles for civilian use in the United Kingdom	1935	1943Apparel (millions)-Boots and shoes (pairs) Leather uppers Men&apos;s  ...      ...

The production of many, articles such as motor cars, refrigerators, pianos,vacuum-cleaners, lawn-mowers and aluminium hollow-ware has been com-&apos;pletely suspended from 1941 or 1942, while the production of cutlery, wirelesssets, and valves, bicycles, watches and fountain-pens has been drasticallycurtailed. Newly produced furniture may be supplied only against permits to persons setting up house (such as newly married persons or people who havebeen bombed-out), and to parents needing a bed. for a&apos;growing child. Theuse of jute and cork in the manufacture of floor covering is prohibited andthe present small output is all of, debased quality.Inland transport80. Rail. Since the war began there has been an increase of about 10 percent, in the total number of passenger journeys. To a considerable extent thisrise has been caused by the increased travelling of members of the british forces and of the large number of American and other Allied Forces stationed in the, United Kingdom. The average length of journeys has increased so thatthe number of passenger-miles is estimated to have risen by about 60 per cent..The facilities for carrying this increased traffic could&apos;not be provided duringthe war and, in fact, there has been 0a reduction in the number of passengertrains running as well as the withdrawal of many long-distance trains.   As a
28    -     kresult the number of passenger train miles is now 30 per cent, below the pre-war-level, and the average load carried isT.25 per cent, greater than before thewar.Passenger traffic on main-line railways in Great BritainTABLE 32_;__   Millions1935-38 average1939194019411942r1943Loadedtrain-miles268246190192193194Number of journeysFull fare,monthlyreturn,excursion,weekend,tourist,etc.546464338347424458Workmen222242253289325318Seasonticket363348272241269292Others465068102144200Total1,1771,1049319781,1611,26881. This reduction in passenger rail facilities has been necessary in order toenable the railways to supply the increased transport needed for essential war purposes. Moreover, the strain on the railway system has been accentuated by the diversion of shipping from London and the South and East coast ports. Since the beginning of the war the tonnage of freight carried by therailways and the average length of haul have both increased so that the work done by the railways measured by net ton miles has risen by about 40 percent.Freight train traffic on main-line railways in Great BritainTABLE 33Loadedtrain-milesMillionsOriginating tonnageMerchandiseMineralsCoal, cokeandpatent fuelTotalMillion tons1935-38 average1939194019411942194312012413313113513545 050-456-661 -170-181 -051 -450-957-660-860-561 -4171 -8183-0175 0161 -3160-7154-8268-2284-2289-2283-2291 -4297-2

Road. The total number of private cars licensed has fallen from  million in August, 1939, to 700,000 at the beginning of 1944 and their usenasbeen restricted^to essential purposes. The amount of motor spirit used for private cars is now only about one-eight of what it was before the war.83. At the outbreak of war a small allowance of motor-spirit was madeavailable to all private car owners to which was added a supplementary rationfor essential purposes. In 1941 the unconditional ration of motor spirit wasabolished and control was obtained over the use of all fuel issued. Apart fromsaving fuel this step was taken to conserve&apos; rubber which became in short&quot;supply after the loss of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.84. Considerable restrictions have been imposed on omnibus services. Forexample, in the early&apos;summer of 1941 long-distance express services weredrastically curtailed, with the result that the total mileage of all bus routesin the country was reduced by 40 per cent. The growth of war industries and the dispersal of production gave rise to increased demands for the transportof workers and this placed a heavy strain on the bus services which were maintained; not only were the number of passengers greater but many have hadto travel longer distances to work than formerly. Many bus undertakingshave had to carry from 30 to 50 per cent, more passengers than in. 1938, whileover the whole Country the number of passengers carried has increased by almostone-fifth and the number of passenger-miles by one-third.Housing .85. During the war there has been an almost complete ban on- the erection of new houses and facilities for repair and maintenance work to existing houseshave been severely curtailed. These factors alone, during the five years ofwar, would have led to a serious deterioration in living conditions. conditions have been made much worse by bomb damage, by the necessity for the partialevacuation of certain areas (with consequent crowding in others), and by therequisition of houses for the Services.-86. Out of about 13 million houses in the United Kingdom at the outbreakof war, 4.5 million houses have been damaged by enemy action. Of these,202,000 have been totally destroyed or damaged beyond repair. A substantial number of those seriously damaged are still uninhabitable, and the greatmajority have not yet been fully repaired.

It is mainly by the taxation &quot;ofprivate income, i.e., the income of persons and -businesses, that the Governmenthas secured its revenue.TABLE 37Net national income of the United KingdomririiiionCalendar years	&quot;  -   &apos;    &apos;   / Private income (excluding transfer payments)	Income from public property trading etc., received by		Total net national irveome		Central Government	Local authorities	1938 ... 1939 ... 1940 ...... 1941......	4,560 4,927 5,896 6,817	18 16 24 41	26 25 , 25 27	4,604 4,968 5,968 6,8851942 ...... 1943 ......	7,500 8,075	76 69	28 28	7,604 8,17292.

The effect of these changes and of increased earnings has been0 increase the number of income tax payers from 4 millions&quot;&apos;in 1938-39 to3 millions in 1943-44 and to increase the income tax payable by them from336 million to  1,183 million, i Before the war less than one million manuale-earners were liable to income tax and they paid  3 million; in 1943-44he number had increased to 7 millions and they paid  200 million.93. The rates of sur-tax on! incomes over  2,000 a year have also beencreased since 1938-39.

Apart from the. increase of income-tax, an excess profits tax of 6q per: cent, was imposed, in 19392 andthis.was increased to 100 per cent, in 1940.&apos;97. ThesedireCt taxes paid by persons and ibusinesses to the GentrahGovern-ment rose from  494 millions in 1938 to  1,781 millions in 1943. Some of theincome tax- collected from persons from 1941 onwards is due for repaymentafter the war; up to the end of 1943 the amount repayable was  305 millions.Both persons and&apos; businesses have also had to pay social insurance contri-butions and War Damage Act contributions and premiums. .;-    &quot;:Disposal of private income- -table 40 ^   millionCalendar &apos; years	Private income of persons and businesses before tax (excluding transfer payments)&quot;	Plus transfer payments (*)	Minus Direct taxation and ? contributions paid to&apos; &apos;&apos;		Private income after direct-taxation and compulsory-.. contributions			Central&apos; Government	Extra&quot;..... budgetary. funds.0)r ,	1938&apos; 1939 1940 1941: 1942 1943	4,560: 4,927 5,896 6,817 7,500 8,075	478 475? 479 509 559 628	494 544-729 1,088 1,383 .1,781	55 55 60 142 137 124	4&apos;,48T 4,803: 5.586   V 6.096 6,539. 6,798:(&apos;) Thetransfer payments are pension payments, payments in respect of unemployment andthe relief of poverty, health and:other transfer payments including interest on the nationaldebt and accrued Interest on national savings-certificates.(2) War Damage Act contributions and premiums-arid payments tothe Unemployment and national Health Insurance Funds, etc.
98. Table 41 shows how total private income of persons and businesses,&quot;after paying-direct taxation and compulsory contributions, has been spent on current goods and services or saved. Since 1938 they have.bought a smaller&quot;quantity of consumers&apos; goods and services, but they have had to spend a largersum to obtain, them because of increases in indirect taxes and higher prices.(See Table 25 in Section IV of this paper.) Nevertheless, their savings have risen during the war and in 1943 were five times what they were in 1938.Private expenditure and savingsTABLE 41   millionCalendar years	Personal expenditure on current goods and services (x)	1,4    Private savings, including allowance for accrued taxation	Private income after direct taxation1938      ...... 1939 1940&apos; -......	4,138 4,244    : , 4,376	351 559 1,210	4,489 4,803 5,586&apos;&apos;1941 1942 .    ...     .... 1943      ...	4,624 4,925 5,049	1,472 1,614 1,749	6,096 6,539 6,798(^Including expenditure involved in the acquisition and transfer of property and lifeassurance, estimated at  68 million in 1943.99.-Indirect taxes. The Government have imposed new. and higher rates of tax on many articles of consumption which private persons could still buyduring the war. The duty on a pint of beer of average strength in 1938was 2^d., and at the reduced average j strength in 1943, 7-^d., and there havebeen corresponding increases in the duties on whisky and other spirits. the tax on a packet of 20 cigarettes for which the retail price was n-gd. or is. in1938 was then 5-^-d.; in 1943 the duty was is. 9d. and the retail price 2S. 4a1.Since the war a Purchase Tax has been imposed on most articles of personalor domestic use. In general, garments and footwear for young children&apos;s wear. and a range of other articles made and sold under the special regulationsrelating to &quot; Utility &quot; goods are exempt from this tax. The basic rate of taxIs. 33i Per cent, of the wholesale value, but certain articles of a kind which require comparatively frequent replacement are charged at the reduced rate ofi6f- per cent, and yarious classes of goods of a&apos;luxury or non-essential characterare taxed.at the higher rate of 100 per cent. :100. Indirect taxes levied by the Central Government which fall specificallyon personal consumption rose from  290 millions in 1938 to  915 millions in1943, while total receipts of the Central Government from indirect taxationrose from  371 millions to  1,026 millions. The tax paid on beer and tobaccowas more than  600 millions in 1943 not far short of the total revenue fromall sources collected by the Central Government in a single year before thewar. Local rates on dwelling houses and personal consumption collected byLocal Government Authorities have also increased slightly from  149 millions in 1938 to  158 millions in 1943.

While, however, the Government has increased the taxes on luxuryand less essential articles, it has, *at the same time, adopted the policy ofgiving subsidies to keep down the level of prices of food and other essential goods. The amount expended in subsidies for this purpose was  190 millions in 1943-102.

Sources of Government borrowingstos Private savin? (of persons and businesses) as shown in Table 41 has-increased from  351-millions in 1938 to  r/,749 millions in 1943. It is mainly from this source that the Government has been able to borrow during the war.Private persons, in spite of heavy taxation, have saved much more than theydid before the war, both absolutely and relatively to the size of their, incomes.Businesses and public bodies have also saved more, mainly, by foregoingrenewals and repairs and by not undertaking new capital investment duringthe war, and diverting the allowances normally put aside- for these purposesinto Government loans.104. Further additional amounts of money have become available by borrowing (a) the balances on various public funds, such as those of localauthorities and of extra-budgetary funds; and (b) the proceeds of the sales of assets overseas and by borrowing sterling accumulated already in london by Empire and foreign countries (disinvestment abroad).Sources of Government borrowingsTABLE 44   mjHionCalendar years	Private savings	Public savings (surpluses of local authorities, extra-budgetary funds and War Claims)&apos;	Net   &apos; disinvestment at home	Net disinvestment abroad	Total Central Government borrowings1938 1939 194,0 1941 1942      ....	351 559 1,210 1,472 1,614	29 72 &apos; 225 439 377	(-305) -(i) (-362) (i) (-119) (i) 82 140	55 230 756 797 635	130 499 2,082 2,790 2,7661943	1,749	327	175	655	2,906(x) In these years the figures represent private net investment at home.105. In. order.to conserve these resources for essential purposes connectedwith the war and to enable essential loans to be raised.as cheaply as possible,capital issues have been controlled. At the same time, it has been the policyof the Goyernment that banks should not make advances for the purpose of enabling their customers to take up war loans.106. The following table shows that in 1943, among, the various sources of borrowing; small savings provided: just under; a quarter of all the amounts which; the Government needed to borrow and public subscriptions to war loansjust over a.third. ..,

Although the Government has in this way been able to raise the moneyneeded for the prosecution of the war by taxation and by borrowing, the con-sequences on the economic structure of the country are far-reaching.(1) Depreciation of Capital resources. Since the savings of private persons and businesses have been lent during the war to the Government they havenot been spent in keeping in repair and up-to-date houses, factories andindustrial equipment, or in installing new capital equipment, except in sofar as this has been necessary for the prosecution of the war.(2) War Damage. There has been widespread destruction of and damage to buildings, industrial plant, business equipment, public utilities, eom-modities and private chattels. The immediate repair of some of this damage was necessary, as it affected production, communications and other services essential for the war effort and for the maintenance of the United kingdom as an operational base. It was also obviously desirable, in the interests ofthe war effort, to repair as many houses as could quickly be rendered habit-able. This work of repair had to proceed concurrently with the insistentdemands of the war on the limited resources of man-power and materialsavailable, and thereby aggravated the problems raised by those demands.By far the greater part of the cost of replacing or repairing the destroyed or damaged assets still remains, however, to be met.(3) Increase of overseas liabilities. Notwithstanding the generous aidreceived from the United States and Canada, overseas assets to the valueof  1,065 millions have been sold and the United Kingdom has incurredliabilities abroad amounting to over  2,300 millions during the war. Thesedo not include losses of overseas assets abroad in Empire countries whichhave been destroyed or damaged to deny their use to the enemy. The loss1 of these overseas assets has deprived this country of a source of income which has, in the past, contributed an essential part of the foreign exchangeneeded to pay for imports.

Aero-engines exclude jet-propulsion engines.The &quot; bomb load &quot; means the maximum carrying capacity in weight of bombs for one sortie at a given range.Table 15. Iron ore. The figures refer to the weight of iron ore as mined,before any preparatory processes take place. The average ferrous content ofhome ore is about 30 per cent., compared with 50 to 60 per cent, for importedore.Pig-iron. The production of basic, hematite, foundry and forge pig-iron,direct castings and blast furnace ferro-alloys.Scrap for steelmaking. Receipts at steel works and steel foundries of ironand steel scrap bought in the home market, plus the weight of scrap arising in steel-makers&apos; own works.Timber. Output of hardwood and softwood of timber (other than miningtimber) of domestic origin sawn from the round. Sawn mining timber is included in pitwood except in 1930 when it is included in sawn timber.In order to make the figures comparable with the statistics of imports givenin Table 24, they have been converted from cubic feet at the following rates:hardwood at 45 cubic feet per ton, softwood at 66 cubic feet per ton, andpitwood at an average of 44 cubic feet per ton.Aluminium. The output of unwrought virgin aluminium and the purecontent of virgin alloys.Magnesium.   New metal and metal recovered from scrap.Cotton yam.

From 1943 onwards lucerne has also been returned as temporary grassland.The permanent grass acreage relates only to that grassland area which isnot under rotation.
,   4iTable 17. The estimates of the quantities harvested are obtained bycombining the 4th June acreage with estimates of yields made by crop-reporters.The figures for 1944 are preliminary estimates; the final estimates are prepared in November.Table 18. The livestock population is the number of animals returned byall occupiers of more than one acre of agricultural land in Great Britain and0ne-quarter of an acre in Northern Ireland.Section III Shipping and Foreign TradeTable 19. The figures represent the losses of merchant vessels (excluding ,commissioned ships) as recorded by the Admiralty and relate to the months in which the losses occurred. They include losses by enemy action and marinerisk.

Each ton of freight is counted once only, irrespective of thenumber of railways over which it was carried. &quot; Free-hauled &quot; traffic (railwaycompanies&apos; service materials conveyed without charge) is excluded.Table 34. Figures of loaded wagon-miles are obtained by multiplying thenumber of wagons loaded by the mileage they travel.Estimated net ton-miles are the produce of the load conveyed by the mileagetravelled.Section V finance the Tables in this section are derived from the White Paper &quot; An analysis of the Sources of War Finance and an Estimate of the National Income andExpenditure in the years 1938 to 1943 &quot; (Cmd. 6520).
