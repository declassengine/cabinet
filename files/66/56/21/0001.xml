(44) 571.14 A October, 1944.war CABINET.MIGRATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theMinister of Labour and National Service.AT the meeting of Prime Ministers on the 12th May, 1944 (P.M.M. (44)13th Meeting) there was some discussion on the possible arrangements for post-war migration, and it was generally agreed that the matter should be examined by experts of the United Kingdom and Dominion Governments with a view to the formulation of schemes for the consideration of the respective Governments. TheDominion Governments have been invited to nominate representatives to take part in such consultations, and the replies make it clear that detailed discussions with Australia could usefully be started forthwith, in addition to more generaldiscussions at a somewhat later date.2. We - have accordingly considered the departmental arrangements, both for the conduct of the negotiations with the Dominions and for the administrationof the general policy which it is hoped may be agreed upon as a result. TheReport of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Oversea Settlement on Demobi-lisation, which was approved by the Committee on Reconstruction Problems onthe llth February, 1943 (R.P. (43) 3rd Meeting), recommended that, while theDominions Office should be generally responsible for migration policy, includingnegotiations with. oversea Governments and voluntary societies, the detailedadministration of the free passage scheme on demobilisation contemplated in theReport could most conveniently be carried out by the Ministry of Labour and national Service. It appears to us that this arrangement, which would involveclose association between the two Departments concerned in all consultations and negotiations with the Dominion Governments, could appropriately be generalisedso as to cover post-war migration as a whole.3. We are satisfied that the working out of such an arrangement should not present any practical difficulty, having regard on the one hand to the experienceavailable in the Dominions Office as to policy and negotiations regardingmigration and on the other hand to the functions which the Ministry of Labourand National Service will be performing in relation to resettlement in this country,especially as regards demobilisation and resettlement of ex-Service personnel&apos;Suitable arrangements would be made to ensure that other Departments are brought into consultation as need may arise.4.   We propose accordingly to proceed on the above lines.  .E. B.C.14 A October, 1944.[28392]
