THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTs        ^Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 566.llth October, 1944.WAR CABINET.TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILL, CLAUSES 45 and 46.Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning.AT their meeting on the 9th October (W.M. (44) 134th Conclusions,Minute 12), the War Cabinet appointed a Committee to give further considerationto the questions raised bv Clauses 45 and 46 of the Town and Country planning bill.2. The Committee have requested me to -submit to the War Cabinet theprinciples upon which they are agreed. These principles are set out in theAppendix annexed to this memorandum. They are being put into the form of draft clauses by Parliamentary Counsel in the hope that, if the principles are approved by the War Cabinet, it may be possible to put down new clauses at thebeginning of next week.   This will involve the recommittal of the Bill.3. As regards paragraph 1 of the Appendix, the Committee felt that, on grounds of equity, some attempt should be made to meet the case of the owner(and not merely the owner-occupier) of agricultural property, who, since the31st March, 1939, had made at the direction or at least with the consent of theWar Agricultural Executive Committee, but at his own expense, improvements,drainage works, &amp;c. The cost of making such improvements had risen since1939, in many cases by more than 30 per cent. Was it fair that the owner shouldreceive in respect of his outlay only what the improvements would have beenworth at the 31st March, 1939, plus 30 per cent? On the other hand it was feltthat this question was part of a wider issue. Could not owners who had spentmoney since 1939 on factories or other buildings as part of the war effort claim that they also were entitled to similar consideration ?4. I was invited to examine this question further, and,.if possible, to submitdraft clauses for consideration by the War Cabinet. I regret that it has not beenpossible for me in the time available to complete my examination. In the cireum-stances I hope that the War Cabinet will be willing to leave the final decision onthis point to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself.5. I found at my meeting with Members of all parties yesterday .a keendesire to give effect to a proposal (which appears in amendments put down bothby the Labour Party and the Tory Reform Group) to give the &quot;speculator &quot; whobought bombed land at &quot; knock-out &quot; prices no more than he paid for it. I had this proposal examined by Parliamentary Counsel some time ago and was -thenadvised that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to draft ,a Clauseto secure this end. It would be highly desirable, from the Parliamentary pointof view, to have some provisions to this effect if they can be drafted, even,though their effect would not be great.6. I have since our meeting last night reconsidered the proposal in the -lastpart of paragraph 5 of Appendix I. I am advised that this proposal would behotly contested by Local Authorities. The argument that a private -purchaserwould have to pay a similar sum is not sound because no private purchaser paysthis sum unless he were entitled to rebuild, in which case his payment would securethe right to a cost of works payment. In the case we are considering, where the rebuilding is to be prohibited, the Local Authority would not secure any right[28374]
APPENDIX.Statement of Principles.1. The general principle is maintained that compensation in respect of land and buildings shall be assessed by reference to prices current at the 31st March,1939. No general increase shall be allowed automatically, in respect of any classof property, but exceptional provision is made for owner-occupiers on the lines set out below.2. The owner-occupier may be defined as the owner who is in de factooccupation at the date of notice to treat or who can prove to the satisfaction of a tribunal that he had both the right and the intention to resume or take overoccupation within five years of the date of the notice to treat or of the end of thewar. whichever is the sooner.The owner-occupier of buildings.3. It should be open to an owner-occupier of buildings to submit a claim toa tribunal for such additional compensation as may be deemed reasonable, taking into account -(a) the class of property;(b) the interest of the claimant in the property;(c) post-war conditions so far as they can be foreseen; and(d) circumstances existing at the date of the notice to treat,provided that such additional compensation shall not exceed 30 per cent, ofthe 1939 value of the building, and that no addition is made in respect of any increase in the value of the site over and above 1939 values.The owner-occupier of agricultural land.4. It shall be open to an owner-occupier of agricultural land to submit toa tribunal a claim for such additional compensation as may be deemed reasonable,taking into account (a) the class of property;(b) the interest of the claimant in the property;(c) post-war conditions so far as they can be foreseen; and Id) circumstances existing at the elate of the notice to treat.In this case it will be necessary to provide that no compensation should be payable to an extent greater than that by which the 1939 value of the propertyfor agricultural purposes (excluding development rights) plus 30 per cent, exceeds the 1939 value of the property, including development rights.War-damaged buildings.5. A difficulty arises in regard to buildings affected by war damage, whichnormally would attract a cost of works payment, i.e., the complete cost ofrebuilding at current prices. These buildings may be physically either partiallyor wholly destroyed.On compulsory acquisition this cost of works payment is converted into a value payment, which is a cash payment representing the depreciation in valueat 1939 standard.It is difficult to deny to the owner-occupier (or to the man who would beowner-occupier if the property was usable) similar treatment to that contemplate under (2) and (3) above. It is suggested that compensation in such cases shouldbe given by way of supplement on a similar basis to that indicated in (2) and (3)as appropriate if the property had been undamaged.Presumably such compensation should be given by the Local Authority andnot by the War Damage Commission.to a cost of works payment. Moreover, the Local Authorities will not see whythe War Damage Commission should be relieved of liability at their expense.7. Subject to the three preceding paragraphs I submit the principles set outin the Appendix to this memorandum to the War Cabinet for approval.W. S. M.Ministry of Town and Country Planninq, S.W. 1,Utk October,. 1944.
