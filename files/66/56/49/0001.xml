(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET27TH OCTOBER,WAR CABINETPUBLICATION OP STATISTICS ABOUT THE WAR EFFORTOP THE UNITED kingdom memorandum lay the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. At their meeting on 23rd October&apos; (W.M. (44) 140thConclusions, Minute 11) the War Cabinet agreed that a communication should he sent to the President of the UnitedStates asking whether he had any objection tc the proposalto publish figures of merchant shipping losses, and that thequestion should be considered whether any changes weredesirable in Table 14 of the draft White Paper in order toavoid giving information of value to the enemy.2. The President of the United States has nowindicated that he would have no objection to the publicationof shippin,:.; losses up to and including December, 1943?. butthat for security reasons he would prefer not to publish the losses since 1st January, 1944.      In view of this, I suggestthat the War Cabinet should agree that Table 20 might bepublished with the omission of the 1944 figures.3. The questions whether separate figures of naval aircraft should be shown in Table 14 of the White Paper andwhether this Table should include 1944 figures have beenconsidered further by the First Lord of the Admiralty, theSecretary of State for Air and the Minister of- aircraft production.      These Ministers are now agreed -(a) that separate figures for naval aircraft shouldbe shown in Table 14;    and.(b) that this Table should include 1944 figures.J.A.COPY NO(Treasury Chambers,  S.V7.  1.,27th October, 1944.
