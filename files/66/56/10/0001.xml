DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECEET.W.P. (44) 560.7th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.EFM TELEGRAPH SERVICE :   CHRISTMAS 1944.Memorandum by the Postmaster-General.1. The EFM service is a cheap telegraph service whereby in theatres ofwar other than Western Europe, sailors, soldiers and airmen, merchant seamen,and persons in certain auxiliary services can send and receive at a standard rateof 2s. 6c?. telegrams of three phrases, designated by numbers, from a list of some240 standard phrases.2. During the Christmas season of 1941 and 1942 the number of messagessent was so great that very heavy delays, amounting, in some cases, to many weeks,occurred before the traffic could be disposed of. In 1943 the War Cabinet decidedafter very careful consideration (W.M. (43) 132nd Conclusions, 28th September,1943) that the service should be suspended during the Christmas season.3. The effect of the decision was satisfactory and the suspension gave riseto no complaint.4. The considerations which made suspension necessary last year are presentagain this year with even greater force, because of the larger numbers of troopsabroad, and there can be no doubt whatever that, if the service is maintained during the forthcoming Christmas season, the delays will be even more serious than those experienced in 1942 and 1941. The speed of transmission wouldcertainly be inferior to that of the air letter and airgraph services which are muchcheaper (6c?. and 3c?. respectively), and permit a much fuller message of the sender&apos;sown composition. In short, the lines of telegraph communication would be heavilycongested and yet no service of any benefit to members of the Services and theirrelatives and friends would be provided.5. If the service is suspended, compensating facilities will be available : aspecial airgraph form of seasonable Christmas design will in any case be avail-able and it is proposed to provide five free air letters per man for use during the christmas season; and the concession telegraph service will still be available.6. The Imperial Communications Committee, which is representative of allthe Departments concerned, has unanimously recommended that the service shouldbe suspended for the same period as last year, i.e., from the 6th to the25th December.7.   The War Cabinet is accordingly asked to approve this recommendation.H. C.General Post Office,7th October, 1944.Copy No.[28359]
