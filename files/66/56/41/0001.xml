THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 591.25th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.REPORT OF THE SPEAKERS CONFERENCE ON electoral reform.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.1. The War Cabinet, at the meeting on the 20th July, agreed that theproposals of the Speaker&apos;s Conference, dealing with the reform of the franchise,should not be dealt&apos;with in the Bill to implement the recommendations of theConference regarding redistribution, but should be left over to be dealt with at a later date when the Final Report of the Conference had been received.(W.M. (44) 94th Conclusions, Conclusion 8.) The Final Report of the conference has now been received and it is necessary to consider what legislation will berequired to carry out its recommendations.2.   The recommendations fall under the following two heads : (a) Reform of the franchise.(%) Conduct and costs of Parliamentary elections and expenses falling oncandidates and Members of Parliament.3.   The Conference recommends the following reforms of the franchise : (a) The assimilation of the Local Government to the Parliamentary franchise,provided that Peers do not lose their right to vote at Local government elections.We are dealing with this matter in a separate memorandum which we aresubmitting on the question of the renewal of local elections.(b) The removal of a right of a husband or wife to the Business Premisesfranchise, by virtue of the Business Premises qualification of thespouse.On the figures in the 1939 Register this step would effect a reduction ofsome 140,000 in a Business Premises electorate of some 345,000 in England andWales.(c) The automatic registration free of charge of a person entitled to exercise a vote in respect of a University qualification.This would require that the cost of University elections will need to be borneeither by the University concerned, or by the Treasury. It would seem difficultto place this charge on the University since this course would iv all probabilityonly result in the graduation fee being increased.   If registration is to be.free of charge &apos;&apos; it would seem therefore that the cost of University registrationshould be borne by the Treasury, according to a scale to be approved by theTreasury.(d) A* person shall be entitled to be registered in respect of not more thanone residence or more than one business qualification, if this isadministratively practicable.It would not be possible to effect this reform so far as the Business Premisesqualification is concerned, so long as under the new arrangements a business premises Register is to be compiled ad hoc for an election. It must further be appreciated that it will be impossible in any event for Registration Officers to check up on this point where registration is effected in different registration areas.Thus the only sanction in the absence of special information regarding the dualregistration of any particular person could be the knowledge that a&apos; person in[28464]
being registered twice for either of these qualifications would be breaking thelaw; in this connection it should be noted that a person is already committinga criminal offence if he votes twice in respect of the same type of qualification.4. Under the reforms relating to the conduct and costs of elections, theConference recommends : 1(a) A reduction in the legal maximum of candidates&apos; expenses which would consist partly of a basic figure and partly of an allowance in respectof each elector, so far as elections in Great Britain are concerned. \The basic figure would be  450 with an allowance of Id. per electorin Borough constituencies and \\d. per elector in Countyconstituencies.The existing maximum rate is Qd. for each elector in a County constituency,and 5d. for each elector in a Borough constituency.(6) The inclusion of Agents&apos; fees in the legal maximum of election expenses,(c) The compulsory issue of poll cards by Returning Officers instead of thepresent system under which poll cards are issued independently by each candidate.While in normal circumstances this is a desirable reform it would, owing tostaffing difficulties, impose a heavy burden on Registration Officers in theimmediate future. Accordingly we suggest that a provision to effect this in aBill ought not to come into force until a date to be appointed by Order.id) That it should be lawful for nomination papers to be lodged with the returning Officer at any time between the issue of the writ andnomination day; and that the deposit should be returned if a candidate polls more than one-tenth of the votes, in cases where thereare more than three candidates or, in a double-member constituency,more than six candidates.In this connection it will be desirable to go rather further than theConference propose and to remove certain outstanding legal obscurities withregard to the return of the deposit where an elected candidate dies or is raised to the peerage prior to taking the oath.(e) It is proposed that the hours of poll should be standardised from 7 a.m.to 9 p.m. (under the existing law the hours are fram 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.with an optional extra hour morning and evening at the request ofa candidate).(/) Absent voting by persons physically incapacitated- A Registration \Officer should be authorised to place an elector on the absent voterslist &apos;&apos; on being satisfied that on grounds of physical incapacity theelector is unlikely to be able to vote in person at a forthcomingelection.&quot;It seems to us, however, difficult to accept a requirement which would impose   -on a Registration Officer the need to assess the physical incapacity of an elector,and we think that the better course would be to require the production of a medical certificate which would be binding on a Registration Officer.5. Subject to the slight modifications we. have indicated, we ask for&apos;i authority to proceed with a Bill to carry out these recommendations. We think,however, that the question of the assimilation of the Parliamentary and the LocalGovernment franchises would best be dealt with in the Bill dealing with the renewal of local elections. We appreciate that in view of the congested stateof Parliamentary business there is a case for dealing with local elections in thesame Bill as that&apos; dealing with the main recommendations of the Speaker&apos;conference, but any such Bill would be very unwieldy in view of the subsidiarymatters relating to the renewal of local elections, and we incline to the view thatthe best, and ultimately perhaps the quickest, course would be to have two Bills.6. We have set out in the Appendix a copy of a letter we have receivedfrom the Speaker, dealing in some detail with- the matters which the Conferenceconsider should be examined, following on the suggestion contained in the final report of the Conference that a Committee, with which the Chief Party Agentswill be associated, should be constituted to undertake an examination of the ballot Act and the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act with a view to bringing the provisions of these Acts into line with modern - requirements.
We would propose to set up a Committee for this purpose with the following terms of reference : &apos;&apos; To examine the existing law relating to the conduct of parliamentary and local government elections with particular reference to the provisionsof the Ballot Act, 1872, and the law relating to corrupt and illegal practices;and to consider in what respects it would be desirable that the law relatingto the above matters should be amended so as to render it more appropriate to modern conditions and to make recommendations thereon.&quot;These terms of reference would also enable the Committee to examine those recommendations of the Conference which do not appear to us to be in a formsuitable for immediate legislation, and we suggest that this course should therefore be followed with regard to the following recommendations : (a) The use by candidates for election meetings of schools, or halls,maintained in whole or in part out of State or local funds, subject only to a charge for lighting, cleaning and heating.It is understood that the Conference had in mind the provision of additionalpremises for candidates in rural areas, but this recommendation would not inpractice achieve this, e.g., in most villages the most suitable hall is the ChurchHall, while if implemented it would enable a candidate to hold the meeting inany Town Hall, University premises or premises under the direct control of aGovernment Department. Further consideration would appear to be necessaryin order to effect the purpose contemplated by this recommendation.(6) The amendment of Section 34 of the Representation of the PeopleAct, 1918, to cover expenses incurred by a political or otherorganisation for the purpose of promoting or procuring the election of a candidate.(c) An amendment of the law to make legal payment of speakers&apos; expenses.(d) Relief in respect of venial errors by way of the County or Sheriff Courtsrather than as the result of an Election Petition.(e) The prohibition on a British subject of broadcasting matters affectinga Parliamentary election from wireless stations outside the UnitedKingdom.(/) Increased polling facilities in rural areas.We ask for the approval of the Cabinet to proceed accordingly.H. M.Whitehall, S.W. 1, T. J.   &apos;25th October, 1944.APPENDIX.Speakers House,House of Commons, S.W. 1,My dear Home Secretary, 28th August, 1944YOU will have seen that in my letter to the Prime Minister reporting theconclusion of the work of the Conference on Electoral Reform and redistribution of Seats, I explained that the Conference felt that it would be of advantage ifthe Home Office and the Scottish Office, possibly with the help of the Partyagents, could arrange for a detailed departmental examination of the BallotAct, 1872, and the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act, 1883, with aview to the repeal or amendment of the provisions of those Acts which are nolonger appropriate to modern conditions.,The Prime Minister has agreed to my suggestion that I should send to you and to the Secretary of State for Scotland a note of some suggestions for theamendment of the electoral law which were brought to the notice of theConference, and which, in their opinion, might be included among those suitablefor a departmental inquiry of the kind proposed.These detailed points are as follows : 1. As you will have seen, the Conference rejected a proposal that some additional regulation should be imposed on the number &apos;of conveyances plyingwith voters to the polling booths; and also agreed not to recommend the removalof the existing restrictions on the hiring of conveyances. They thought, however,that - it would be desirable for the application of the Corrupt and IllegalPractices Prevention Act to the use of conveyances at elections to be the subjectof a careful and detailed examination.
- 2.   The Conference were informed that at present there is a differencebetween English and Scottish&apos;law as to what is a correct voting paper.   It was thought that this point should be examined with a yiewr to the adoption of a* provision of general application.3. The attention of the Conference was drawn to the difficulties which may arise from a failure to put the embossed stamp on ballot papers. It was represented that the embossed stamp may be difficult to see, and that some alternative method (for example, perforation) might be adopted.4. The question was raised whether any clarification of the law was practicable with regard to the question of employers using their employees toassist them at election time.5. It was suggested that the possibility of strengthening the law as regardspersonation should be examined.6. The question was raised whether the provisions of the Corrupt andIllegal Practices Prevention Act prohibiting expenses on account of bands ofmusic, cockades, marks of distinction, &amp;c., should be repealed.7. It was suggested that the position with regard to the supply of lightrefreshment for voluntary workers should be examined.8.. It was suggested that the law relating to election petitions might be amended so as to reduce the costs involved in making such petitions, and also toprovide that complainants should be entitled to lay alleged illegalities before theDirector of Public Prosecutions, who, if satisfied&quot; that there was a prima faciecase of sufficient gravity, should himself take proceedings and be responsible forthe costs. If the Director refused to act, it should still be open to the complainantsto launch an election petition on their own initiative.9. The proposal was made that the election agent should be given the rightof visiting any and every polling station.10. It was suggested that provisions were required to prevent personswearing Party favours and checkers and messengers taking their stand withinthe precincts of a polling station; and that the Returning Officer should determine, according to the lay-out of the building, the parts which were to beregarded as the public entrances to the precincts of the polling station.11. It was suggested that Rule 31 of the First Schedule to the Ballot Actshould be amended so as to provide that either candidates or their election agentsshould be able to appoint agents to attend at the counting of votes. i12. It was suggested that the number of counting agents should be fixed on the basis, say, of one agent to two official counters.13. The proposal was made that it would be desirable to make more detailedprovision with regard to counting procedure. It was suggested that countingshould take place not merely &apos;&apos; in the presence of &apos;&apos; the counting agents, but under their direct observation; that the election agents of the candidates should havethe right to check the bundles of ballot papers assembled on the Returning Officer&apos;stable; and that a candidate or his election agent should be enabled to demand arecount of votes on reasonable grounds before declaration of the poll.14. The proposal was made that candidates should have a statutory right to demand scrutiny as a State obligation where the total of spoilt votes exceeded themajority, or, alternatively, a possible appeal to the County Court on the questionof the validity of spoilt ballot papers.15. It was suggested that there should be a specific provision that ballotboxes should be kept under police surveillance between the close of the polland subsequent transport to the count.16. It was suggested that it should be compulsory for an imprint to beput on all election publications issued to the public.17. It was suggested that, as regards the Register, the names of womenelectors should be designated &quot; Mrs.&quot; or &quot; Miss &quot; ; and that names and addressesin rural areas should be in &quot; walking order &apos;&apos; in roads or built up parts ofvillages, followed by alphabetical lists of electors in scattered parts.18. It was suggested that there should be a uniform provision as to thenumber of polling agents permitted, so as to ensure that only one of each candi-date&apos;s agents may be in attendance at one polling station at any timefI am sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary of State for Scotland.Yours very sincerely,D. CLIFTON BROWN.The Right Hon. Herbert Morrison, M.P.,Home Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1.
