THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 555.3rd October, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAJOR WAR  CRIMINALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 4th September (War Cabinet Conclusions 116 (44) 4th September),the Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he proposed to discusspersonally with President Roosevelt in the course of the meetings at Quebecthe question of the major war criminals whose crimes had no geographicallocation. I circulate to my colleagues herewith the draft of a telegram for despatch to Marshal Stalin jointly by the Prime Minister and president roosevelt, which was drawn up in Quebec. The Prime Minister agreed withthe President that he would circulate this draft to his colleagues and that thePresident should meanwhile discuss it with Mr. Cordell Hull. The PrimeMinister now proposes, if the War Cabinet agrees, to telegraph to president roosevelt to enquire whether he has made any progress in the matter.A. E.Foreign Office, 3rd October, 1944.Draft of a Suggested Telegram to be Sent by the President and thePrime Minister to Marshal Stalin.1. In the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers before Teheran, thePrime Minister of Great Britain submitted a draft proposing the local punish-ment of war criminals in the countries and. if possible, at the scenes where theiratrocities had been committed. With some small amendments this document was approved and has been published to the world with general acceptance and approval. This document, however, did not attempt to deal with the cases ofthe major war criminals &quot;whose offences have no particular geographicallocalisation.&quot; This matter was touched on in conversation at Teheran withoutany definite conclusion being reached. It has now become important for tts toreach agreement about the treatment of these major criminals. Would yonconsider whether a list could not be prepared of say 50 to 100 persons whoseresponsibilities for directing or impelling the whole process of crime and atrocityis established by the fact of their holding certain high offices. Such a list wouldnot of course be exhaustive. New names could be added at any time. It isproposed that these persons should be declared, on the authority of the united nations, to be world outlaws and that upon any of them falling into Allied handsthe Allies will &quot; decide how they are to be disposed of and the execution of thisdecision will be carried out immediately.&quot; Or, alternatively, &quot; the nearestGeneral Officer will convene a Court for the sole purpose of establishing theiridentity, and when this has been done will have them shot within six hourswithout reference to higher authority.&quot;2. It would seem that the method of trial, conviction and judicial sentenceis quite inappropriate for notorious ringleaders such as Hitler, Himmler,Goring, Goebbels and Ribbentrop. Apart from the formidable difficulties ofconstituting the Court, formulating the charge and assembling the evidence,12529   [28334]
the question of their fate is a political and not a judicial one. It could notrest with judges however eminent or learned to decide finally a matter like this which is of the widest and most vital public policy. The decision mustbe &quot;the joint decision of the Governments of the Allies.&quot; This in fact was expressed in the Moscow Declaration.3. There would seem to be advantages in publishing a list of names. Atthe present time, Hitler and his leading associates know that their fate willbe sealed when the German Army and people &quot;cease to resist. It therefore coststhem nothing to go on giving orders to fight to the last man, die in the lastditch, &amp;c. As long as they can persuade the German people to do this, theycontinue to live on the fat of the laud and have exalted employments. they represent themselves and the German people as sharing the same rights andfate. Once howrever their names are published and they are isolated, the mass of the German people will infer rightly that there is a difference between thesemajor criminals and themselves. A divergence of interests between the. notoriousleaders and their dupes will become apparent. This may lead to undermining the authority of the doomed leaders and to setting their own people against them, and thus may help the break up of Germany.4. We should be very glad to have your views upon this proposal at yourearliest convenience It is, of course, without prejudice to the great mass ofGerman war criminals, who wall be handed over for the judgment of the countries where their crimes have been committed.W. S. C.17.9.44.
