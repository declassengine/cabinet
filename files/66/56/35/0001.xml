THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. &apos; Copy No.W.P. (44) 585.23rd October, 1944.WAR CABINET.ORGANISATION OF CIVIL AVIATION.&quot; Memorandum by the Minister for Civil Aviation,I want as early as possible to put to my colleagues some general ideas on theorganisation of Civil Aviation. These are not just first impressions. I have readall the papers. I have also, during the last two years, had the opportunity of seeing British and American transport aviation at work in Africa. I havetalked with Field-Marshal Smuts and his Ministers. And we have prepared in west Africa comprehensive plans for trunk and subsidiary services to meet thepost-war needs of that area.2. I am a profound believer in the wide scope and vital importance of civilaviation. I have tried to approach the problems of civil aviation without anyprejudice. The more I study them, the more I am impressed with certainprinciples, which I have tried to set out as shortly as I can.3. Civil aviation is first and foremost a Transport business. To make itefficient and complete against the United States we must have the best brains and experience in transport.4. If we refuse the partnership of shipping, motor transport, railways, wedeprive ourselves of the best and most varied experience in traffic management(people, goods and mail) and of a network of organisation all over the world.5. It is alleged that, if other forms of transport are allowed to take part,they will use their position to stifle or suppress aviation, as the railways did the canals. Even if this were the desire, it would not be possible except perhaps on united Kingdom internal routes. Everywhere else, in Europe, Asia and Africa,across the oceans, the competition will be against the highly efficient air servicesof the United States, and later of Dutch and other countries. This competitioncan only be met by equally good, or better, air lines.6. This fact is fully appreciated by the progressive shipping lines. Forexample, in West Africa, Holts (Elder, Dempster) and United Africa Companyintend all their staff to travel by air. In the design of new ships, they are notattempting to compete by providing first-class cabins.   They want to be in the air.7. The railways certainly accept this for European traffic. I think it iswrong to assume they do not accept it internally. I understand they have madea success of their motor business; and that before the war they were fairly air-minded in the operation of their air lines.8. In any case, why rule out the independent motor businesses, who are verycompetent traffic managers ?9. I hope we shall not let fears of suppressive competition blind us to theimportance and value of co-ordination. It is generally accepted that co-ordinationof transport is essential. Shall we not get the most effective co-ordination in apartnership?10.   A lot of small competing companies is clearly uneconomic.   But wemust be very sure we do not make a single enterprise too big.  Air transport wantsattention all along the route.   B.O.A.C. will have much to do in making their[28434]

There is much to be said for having the competitive experience of several large British undertakings. This does not mean competition on the sameroutes.12. In selecting or licensing ia company or instrument to run a route, HisMajestyY Government can and should lay down conditions, including who shouldbe admitted or offered participation; and the routes to be served, to ensure thatthe licensee, took the rough with the smooth.13. If we decide to have several chosen instruments for civil aviation, givingeach a number of routes, it might well be desirable to give B.O.A.C. an interestin each company. - This would ensure a day-to-day pooling of experience andideas. It would render simpler the training of crews, the interchange of personnel and machines, common user of maintenance and repair facilities, and theco-ordination and inter-connection of services; e.g., Empire and Continentalroutes, feeder services at home.14. I am more anxious about efficient traffic management than about aircraft.We are sadly behind in design and production of transport planes, an inevitablewar sacrifice. But I am confident that British designers of aircraft and engines,and British workmen, will be able to do as well in civil machines as they have in service aircraft. There is no time to be lost. We must have a sufficiency of designstaff: that is where initial time is saved or lost. But to get the right aircraftwe want two things : &apos;(a) the best design staffs and engineers;(b) the most efficient transport organisation to tell the designers what, they want and the two working together.You get the best ship by the combination-of a good shipowner and a goodshipbuilder. You get the best fighting aircraft by marrying a good General staff to a firm which is good at design and production.15. I hope we need not argue Socialism versus private enterprise at thisstage. Our national and Imperial interest demands that we should have the most efficient instrument or instruments;- and efficiency depends on men and experience,and not on &quot; isms.&quot; Our fight must be with foreign competitors and not amongstourselves. Do not let us exclude the highest competence, because B.O.A.C. isnationalised and the shipping and motor and railway companies are not. If thecountry decides to nationalise railways or ships or motor transport, then one morepartner in civil aviation will be nation-owned. But the most optimistic Socialisthardly hopes to nationalise all industries at the same time. And if, in the future,some industries should be nationalised and others not, I trust there will not bea gulf fixed which forbids partnership or working arrangements between the nationalised and the free.16. There is nothing in the proposals I have put forward which runs counter to the principles on which we are all agreed, namely :-the fullest Empire co-operation;the avoidance of uneconomic competition;the fair distribution by convention of routes, frequencies and rates of charge;the progressive elimination of subsidies;the observance of safety regulations and standards laid down by convention;the maximum use of British aircraft;the fullest opportunities for British airmen.   -S.
