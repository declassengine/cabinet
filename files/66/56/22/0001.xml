(44) 572.lUh October, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE AIRCRAFT PROGRAMME.Note by the Minister of Aircraft Production.THERE are at present in existence two programmes known respectively asthe August programme and the September programme. The August programmereflected the reduction in M.A.P. man-power involved in the decision of theWar Cabinet at their meeting on the 3rd August, 1944 (WM. (44) 100thConclusions) on the future size of the R;A.F. This programme, which covers the period to the 31st December, 1946, was based upon the indefinite continuanceof the German war. The September programme, on the other hand, was basedon assumptions, authorised by the Cabinet, to the effect that the German war would not continue beyond the 31st December, 1944, and that the Japanese war would last eighteen months after the end of the German war.2. Executive action on the September programme has been suspended sincethe day of its issue. It is imperative that the state of uncertainty thus createdshould be ended immediately and that action upon a firm programme should beauthorised forthwith.3. It has been suggested that for the time being, my Department shouldorder aircraft and plan production upon the August programme, but should atthe same time make its plans for putting the September programme into effect at some indefinite date in the future. Such a course is not practicable and anyattempt to carry it out would certainly be most wasteful and harmful. Thereasons for this are as follows : (a) A production programme with the dates left blank for later insertion isa practical proposition in the case of standard established articles,such as bombs or guns. In the Gase of such stores as these, plans canbe made for the closing of this or that factory or the curtailment ofits output without necessarily fixing the actual dates on which theyare to be put into effect. But an aircraft programme must providefor the successive alteration of types and of marks of aircraft atdefinite dates determined largely by the expected progress of designwork and the operational demands of the Services. Moreover, due tothe time required to fabricate materials, to organise sub-contracting,to design and make jigs and tools, these dates must be determined along way ahead, and once they are determined the rest of the aircraft programme and all its subsidiary programmes must be adjusted tothem.(b) The two (i.e., the August and the September) programmes differ not onlyin size but in pattern. The Halifax bomber, for example, is notrequired in Stage II, and the September programme therefore providesfor the introduction of Halifax transport aircraft in place of bombersas from January 1945. It also provides for an increased number ofF.A.A. types at the expense of R.A.F. types not required or required[28390]
in smaller numbers for the Fast East.    Delay in operating the september programme so far as these changes in pattern are concerned.* would seriously delay the re-equipment of our Air Forces with aircraftrequired for Stage II, the effect being particularly serious in the caseof Naval types.(c) The August programme, since it did not budget for an end of the german war in 1945, showed an increasing output throughout that year and took no particular account of stocks of aircraft during that year.Heavy bombers are shown, for example, rising from 461 in the monthof August 1944 to a peak of 681 reached in October 1946. To achieve this programme M.A.P.&apos;s labour force must not, during 1945 and 1946fall below the 31st December, 1944, figure of 1,623,000, and it mightwell need to be increased. It would certainly be necessary to increasethe labour force at particular factories, many of which are in difficultlabour areas. Some of the factories programmed to increase in thisway would not, in fact, be required at all in Stage II. Considerablecapital expansion schemes would be called for to ensure the supply of items to balance the programme (e.g., over  6,000,000 on converting&apos; engine factories to new types;  750,000 for new tyre-making capacity and so on). Little of this could be postponed without allowing theconstruction of airframes to continue in the certain knowledge thatthey would remain merely frames.(d) The Sinclair Mission in Washington has been provided with data ofM.A.P. requirements in 1945 on the assumption that the German war.  will, end this winter.   The continuance of the August programme would necessitate a whole-soale revision of these data.   Failure so to&quot;change the Mission&apos;s instructions would mean that we should be- without essential components required for the August programme.(e) I estimate that if the German war does not continue beyond about.*  March 1945 aircraft components are now being produced at a rateof approximately  5,000,000 a month irf&quot;gxcess of requirements. this figure will increase very rapidly owing to the fact that in about sixmonths&apos; time (when these components would be delivered in aircraft)the September programme begins to tail off very rapidly, whereas the august programme is on an increasing scale. And the proportion ofirretrievable waste in this figure will be further increased rapidly asthe surplus piles up at the end of Stage I beyond what can be absorbedor made use of in Stage II. Part of the additional expenditure wouldbe in the form of Canadian dollars since to continue on the basis ofthe August programme would mean reversing the decent decision to cancel the 1945 aluminium orders on Canada.(/) If we delay replanning until Germany is defeated or very nearly so, the cuts in production would then have to be much more severe and rapidthan are proposed by the September programme. This would notonly involve great disturbance throughout the aircraft and alliedindustries, but would also release labour at a much more rapid rate than is now proposed, and these labour releases would coincide with,or but shortly precede, demobilisation from the Forces, with the consequent risk of serious unemployment.(g) Postponement of the September programme would mean delay in theintroduction of civil types of aircraft.4. The possibility of the German war continuing into the Spring of 1945need not involve the preparation of an entirely new programme. The Septemberprogramme does not involve a serious diminution in the output of aircraft in thefirst three snonths of 1945. As compared with the August programme, produc-tion of heavy bombers would on average be some 20 per week less during thosemonths, of medium bombers some 4 per week less, and of light bombers and fighterssome 28 per week less. After allowing for increases in the production of trans-ports and Naval airbraft, the net effect of the September programme would beto reduce the output of aircraft during January, February and March 1945 byabout 45 aircraft per week.5. But I understand that the objections to the immediate introduction ofthe September programme lie not so much in the risks of a premature curtail-ment of our military effort as in the fear that it might be construed in america as a premature reconversion of our economy to civilian trade.  I therefore propose
a compromise which T think would meet this objection, viz., that the Septemberprogramme should be modified slightly on the lines shown in the Appendix.&apos;These modifications, which are acceptable to the Ministry of Production, havebeen chosen with the object of avoiding any disturbance of the arrangements which the September programme makes for introducing Japanese war and civiltypes and of reducing to a minimum any change in the details of the case abou,tto be presented to the Americans in Washington for lease-lend assistance in stage II. The effect on the M.A.P. labour force as compared with- the Augustprogramme and the September programme would be as follows : -SeptemberAugustPro-gramme.1,823,0001,623,0001,623,0001,623,000SeptemberPro-gramme.1,520,0001,250,0001,180,0001,170,000Pro-grammemodifiedas in theAppendix.1,6,00t0001,450,0001,200,0001,170,000Estimated total labour force required at31st December, 1944   ....      ......Estimated total labour force required at31st March, 1945        ....      .......Estimated total labour force required at30th June, 1945Estimated total labour force required at31st December, 1945   ... -   ......(These figures are the best estimates that can be made at this date and are givenmerely in illustration of the comparative effort required under the varioushypotheses.)6. This compromise proposal would in effect be equivalent to an assumptionthat the German war would end about June 1945. It is impossible to escape from the need to assume some date or other, since without a knowledge of the peak rate of production required for each type of aircraft and the date, at which that peak is reached, planning is impossible. Unplanned production on theother hand means unbalanced production, i.e., the supply of some components ormaterials in excess of requirements and of others in inadequate quantities; in short, a condition of chaos, which &quot;is already supervening in the materials fieldin consequence of the absence of an authorised programme during the last fewweeks.E, S.

APPENDIX.* *THE compromise solution proposed in paragraph 5 involves amending the september programme in the following respects : Lancaster / Lincoln.(i). Production at the Castle Blromwich and Vickers (Chester) factorieswould cease in September 1945 instead of in May 1945, and a further360 aircraft would be built,(ii) The decision not to turn these factories over to the Lincoln would stillhold good.Halifax.(i) Production at the Fairey (Errwood Park) factory would cease inAugust 1945 instead of in May 1945, and at the Rootes (Speke)factory in July 1945 instead of in May 1945.(ii) The reduction in the programme of the English Electric (Preston)factory would begin to take effect in June 1945 instead of inApril 1945.(iii) The effect of these changes would be to build a further 180 aircraft,viz. : at Fairey (Errwood Park) 50at Rootes (Speke) 90at English Electric (Preston) 40180Wellington.Production at Vickers (Blackpool) factory would cease in October. 1945instead of in July 1945 and a further 210 aircraft would be built.Spitfire.&apos; , A further 400 L.F. XVI&apos;s would be added to the Castle Bromwichprogramme so making the decline in Spitfire production, at this factoryless steep.Typhoon.Production of the Typhoon would cease in September 1945 insteadof in May 1945 and a further 120 aircraft would be built.
