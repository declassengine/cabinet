A convoy from North Russia has arrived in Home Waters.H.M. ships have carried out bombardments in the Eastern mediterranean and have supported landings in Greece.U.S. carrier-borne aircraft have again inflicted heavy damage on Japaneseshipping in the northern Philippines.Two U-boats have been sunk and three possibly sunk.Northern Waters.2. Thirty ships of a convoy from North Russia have arrived in home waters escorted and covered by ships of the Home Fleet. Two ships were losten route.Home Waters and North Atlantic.3. On. the night of the 30th/1st, five M.T.Bs. fought a series of engage-ments off the Dutch coast with a convoy escorted by a destroyer, trawlers,E/R boats and tank landing craft. Two cargo ships of medium size were torpedoed and three trawlers damaged by gunfire. Two of the M.T.Bs. were sunk : there were 18 casualties, including seven killed.4. On the 28th. H.M. ships Kelvin and Urania (destroyers) landed stores and personnel for the F.F.I. at Les Sables d&apos;01onne.5. Work on the harbour at Ostend has been hindered by a gale but sixcoaster berths are now available. At Calais, the ordinary cross-Channel berthsin the Avant Port are in fair order, but the harbour entrance has been mined and obstructed. Cranes and locks and also the Gare Maritime have been heavily damaged! At Boulogne, the initial clearance of the approaches and of part ofthe harbour is now complete. Havre is now open to coasters. L.S.T. and smallercraft. At Brest, there has been extensive harbour demolition and mining. Mostquays and harbour facilities have been rendered useless and even limitedunloading of cargo and troops will be impracticable for a considerable time.At Rouen, 54 barges, 19 tugs and 67 other wrecks were sunk in the harbour andalthough nearly half of the quay space is intact, 129 cranes and elevators were destroyed.6. H.M. Canadian frigate Cheboque. escorting an outward-bound convoy,was torpedoed by a U-boat on the 4th when 500 miles south-west of Ireland (R).Mediterranean.7. Coastal forces, on the night of the 26th/27th, sank an escorted cargo ship of 2,500 tons in the Gulf of Genoa and probably damaged another. On thesame night other coastal forces sank a tanker of 2,500 tons off Rapallo.8. The French Fprbin and the U.S.S. Hilary P. Jones (destroyers) shelledguns and troops near Ventimiglia under ineffective return fire on the 28th. Duringthe succeeding four clays, however, destroyer bombardments in support of the eighth Army were stopped by unfavourable weather. Off the Dalmatian coast,armed landing craft sank two, possibly three, I-lighters on the night of the27th/28th.   L.C.G. shelled a Dalmatian harbour on the 1st.9. On the 26th, a convoy, escorted by H.M.S. Ledbury (destroyer) and sweptin by ELM. minesweepers, landed troops and stores at Katakolo on the west coast of Greece. On the 29th, H.M. ships Black Prince (cruiser) and Tumult(destroyer) bombarded Syra (iEgean). Five F-lighters were sunk and othershipping and harbour works were damaged. On the night of the 30th/1st,Black Prince bombarded Maleme airport (Crete): the ship received superficialdamage from a shore battery. On the following day Allied troops with storeswere landed on Poros (Gulf of Athens) by a fot^ce which included minesweepersand M.Ls supported by two destroyers and coastal forces. The harbour was foundclear of mines and with no evidence of blocking or demolition. On the 3rd,16 carrier-borne sea fires attacked the W/T station at Levitha (iEgean) while16 Hellcats attacked Portolago (Leros). Many coasters and&apos; small craft were bombed and machine-gunned.   One Hellcat is missing.
10. Iii the Dodecanese, H.M. ships. Liddesdale, Zetland and Brecon(destroyers) engaged and silenced batteries on Scarpanto. In addition a largecaique was sunk.   Liddesdale sustained some damage and casualties.11. H.M. and Allied submarines carried out the following attacks in theGulf of Salonika on the 2nd and 3rd : Vox sank a self-propelled lighter escortinga south-bound convoy of coasters. The French Le Curie torpedoed two, possibly three, ships in an escorted north-bound convoy and, the following day, sank a300-ton ship in convoy. Unswerving torpedoed the German s.s. Bertha(1,810 tons). On the 27th, Vigorous torpedoed and probably sank a small cargo ship and an escorted lighter.East Indies.12. H.M. S/M Tantalus attacked an escorted convoy of coasters off thenorth-east coast of Sumatra on the 3rd and sank two ships of 800 tons.Pacific.13. U.S. carrier-borne aircraft renewed their attacks on shipping andshore positions in the northern Philippines on the 23rd. Sixty-five ships,including one destroyer, three escort vessels and three large tankers, are reported as sunk or damaged. In addition, 36 aircraft were destroyed. The JapaneseFleet has now withdrawn from the Islands.14. In the Palau Islands, U.S. ships bombarded two small islands north of Peleliu on the 29th to cover landings by U.S. marines.15. At Morotai (Halmahera) an Allied destroyer shelled an enemy concen-tration on the north coast on the 22nd and other ships shelled positions on thewest coast in support of the land forces.Anti-Submarine Operations.16. Reports have been received of 59 attacks during September. Of these 21were by shore-based aircraft, six by carrier-borne aircraft and 32 by warships.Four U-boats were sunk by shore-based aircraft and four by warships. One -was probably sunk by carrier-borne aircraft in collaboration with destroyers. Fourothers were possibly sunk.17. H.M. S/M Trenchant sank a U-boat on the 23rd off Penang and picked up eleven German survivors. U.S. Liberators sank one on the 28th some 600 miles west of Ascension. U-boats were possibly sunk by H.M.S. Hespeler (corvette)north-west of Malin Head on the 11th, by aircraft from the U.S. ships Bogue andCore west of the Azores during a series of attacks between the 19th and 21st andby a Fortress north-wTest of the Azores on the 26th.Enemy Intelligence.18. Reports, on the damage inflicted on the Tirpitz by aircraft of bomber command on the 15th, state that the ship received a hit forward. A large holewhich extends below the water-line is said to be visible on the starboard side. Itis also reported that the Tirpitz sustained damage during the attack by naval aircraft on the 29th August and that she has not steamed since that attack.Photographic reconnaissance on the 28th showed the Emden in Oslo Fjord.U-Boats.19. It is estimated that, during the passage of the convoy from North Russia,although an isolated attack was made on the convoy, there were about 15 U-boats in the area south of Bear Island which did not make contact.The U-boat campaign is at present on a minor scale and is still chiefly confined to the coastal waters of northern Britain and northern Ireland (R). There isnow no evidence of U-boats in the Channel or the S.W. Approaches.It has been reported from Turkey that two, perhaps three, German U-boats were scuttled simultaneously on or about the 13th off Eregi on the south coast ofthe Black Sea. Eighty-three survivors, including at least eight officers, are statedto have been interned in Turkey.     *[28346] - B
Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. Two ships in convoy from North Russia were sunk by.a U-boat south-east of Bear Island.A U.S. ship was mined 20 miles south of Marseilles.Provisional shipping- losses during September were seven ships of 43,368tons, all of which were sunk by U-boats.Allied Minelaying.21. Aircraft have laid mines in the Kattegat, the Heligoland Bight andin Norwegian waters. Ships laid mines in Norwegian waters and in the Straitof Malacca.Enemy Minelaying&quot;, Allied Minesweeping&quot;.22. The enemy is reported to be carrying out extensive minelaying in theKattegat and off Fredrikshaven.There have again been no reports of minelaying in Home Waters.Seven, mines have been destroyed in the approach channel to Ostend andin the harbour. A new swept channel has been established which shortens the route between Harwich and Ostend.Eleven ground mines and two moored have been destroyed in the approaches to Calais.At Brest the totals are 13 ground and tAvo moored.Clearing operations at Boulogne began on the 30th.Off the Normandy coast 1,438 mines have now been destroyed, including 882ground and 306 moored.23.   In the south of France, most of the Marseilles basins have been cleared.An enemy minefield has been declared in the Hyeres Roads.The.mine totals are: 5,708 ground and 5,991 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.24. Between the 1st and the 15th of September, 14 enemy ships totalling67,708 tons were sunk or captured or became total losses. Of these, seven ships of 55,585 tons were sunk in the Mediterranean.25. The Swedish Government has prohibited the entry of foreign merchantshipping into territorial waters off the east coast of Sweden.26. As a result of the armistice between Finland and Russia eleven Finnishships totalling 25,576 tons are reported to have been seized in German ports.Two others, totalling 2,549 tons, have been seized in Norwegian ports. Inaddition, a number of small craft on charter to the Speer organisation havebeen taken over.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.General.27. During the past week there has been no major development on thefighting front in Western Europe and for the time being the battle has assumeda more static phase. The reasons for this are twofold : first, the Germans,after a period of collapse, have recovered some degree of stability and are showingmore cohesion in their fighting; secondly, the Allied Armies are continuing tobuild up supplies and re-group in readiness for further action. Nevertheless, theweek has brought some useful progress. The First U.S. Army has made advancesof some four to five miles in the attack north of Aachen, where the main defencesof the Siegfried Line have been breached. The Dutch corridor has been widenedand strengthened and is now reasonably secure. In the coastal sector Calais hasbeen captured with a bag of prisoners unofficially estimated at some 8,000, and thelong-range gun coast has been finally occupied. This not only brings relief toS.E. England but also*allows arrangements for the use of Boulogne harbour to go ahead.Southern Gfowp of Armies.28. In this sector useful progress has again been made in the advance onBelfort, and further north in the sectors east of Epinal and Nancy.   The enemy
has shown himself particularly sensitive to our pressure in these areas and hasthrown in numerous counter-attacks, especially in the Nancy salient, wherefighting has been severe.Central Group of Armies.29. There has been little change on this front apart from the First U.S.Army attack launched north of Aachen between Geilenkirchen and Kerkrade onthe 1st. This attack, after some initial progress, has now come up against verydetermined enemy resistance which has slowed it down.Northern Group of Armies.30. During the week the Second British Army, although preoccupied withre-grouping, has made successful efforts to widen and strengthen the Dutchcorridor. On the eastern flank of the corridor a U.S. armoured division, operating in this sector south-eastwards between Sambeek and Helmond, is mopping upenemy resistance in this area west of the Maas (Meuse), although its progress isbeing hampered by marshy ground and minefields.At the tip of the corridor, the importance which the enemy attaches to ourbridgehead at Nijmegen can be seen from his reactions during the week, when heconcentrated his reserves in the Arnhem area with the object of mounting anattack to drive us from our Nijmegen positions. Apart from continuous pressure from the area of the Forest of Reichswalcl, he also launched a series of attacks against the north-eastern flank of our bridgehead, of which the largest in scaieoccurred on the afternoon of the 3rd. Although he threw in a considerable numberof tanks and infantry, and in some places managed to infiltrate our forwardpositions, our defended localities were nowhere penetrated and the attacks werebeaten off.The Nijmegen bridgehead is now strongly held, and despite enemy attempts to destroy them, there are two road bridges open over the Waal. On the west ofthe corridor British troops M-e within three miles of Ffertogenbosch and aredominating the stretch of country between the Maas and Waal to a depth of some20 miles from Nijmegen.Further west, British, Canadian and Polish troops of the First CanadianArmy have extended their bridgehead across the Turnhout-Antwerp Qanal andare across the Dutch frontier north of Merxplas as a result of good progress intheir drive on Tilburg. Still further west Canadian troops advancing towardsBreda have reached a point at least eight miles N.E. of Antwerp, where the dock area is now reported free of enemy mortar and machine gun fire.In the coastal sector the Canadian attack on Calais and Cap Gris Nez, which began on the 25th. made slow progress in the face of inundations, minefields and heavy casualties, but by midday on the 29th all the cross-channel guns weresilenced, and on the night of the 30th/ 1st Calais fell.Italy.31. During the past week operations in Italy have been severely hampered by adverse weather conditions. In the Adriatic sector, after the successfulcrossing of the Uso, Eighth Army troops advanced to the line of the Fiumicino.The enemy has, however, strongly resisted all attempts to cross this river. Onthe 28th, a crossing was made in the Savignano area, but a successful counter-attack by the enemy forced our troops to withdraw to the southern bank of theriver.The weather has now reduced operational activity to shelling and patrolling,and with the exception of an advance in the area south of Sogliano there is littlefurther to report from the Eighth Army sector.Despite the handicap of weather conditions satisfactory progress has beenmade on the Fifth Army front. The enemy is fighting fiercely in this sector, butsteady progress has been made. On the 28th, U.S. troops captured the importanthill features of M. Canda, M. Oggioli and M. Bastione, all of which are astride the road leading to Monghidoro, thence northwards to Bologna. Monghidorc;itself fell on the 2nd, and U.S. forces have now advanced on a general line north of this town, and at their most northerly point are within 20 miles of Bologna.On the western flank of the Fifth Awny, although operations are on a small scale, appreciable gains have been made, largely without opposition. At one point the forces in this sector are now 12 miles south of Prevepelago.[28346], B 2
The Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.32. The Russians have advanced to within 40 miles of Riga from the N.E.and east, but for the past few days they have made no further progress in this area. They have, however, mopped up the remaining centres of German resistance in the rear of their forward troops, and they have occupied a number of islandsoft&apos; the Estonian coast, including Dagoe.Central Sector.33. On the 2nd, the resistance of the Polish forces in Warsaw came to anend. They had held out for twro months against very heavy odds, and by theend of September had been compressed into a small area in the centre of the city.In the Carpathians, S.W. and south of Stryj, the Russians have advancedon a front of 100 miles towards the frontier of Czechoslovakia.Southern Sector.34.   The Russians have gained some ground in the Carpathians east of Dej.They have made no fresh progress in S.E. Hungary, where the enemy claims to be counter-attacking.With the approval of the Yugoslav National Committee Russian troops fromRumania have crossed the Yugoslav frontier in two areas. One of these is southand S.W. of Timisoara, where they have already reached a place 15 miles fromBelgrade. The other area is further south, near Turnu--Severin, where theyhave made some progress towards the important railway Belgrade-Nis.Yugoslavia.35. Russian troops have crossed the Danube into Yugoslavia south ofTurnu-Seyerin and have captured the road centre of Negotin. They have alsoentered the Yugoslav Banat and taken three more*towns N.E. of Belgrade.Enemy attempts to relieve Banjaluka have been strongly opposed by the partisans but the Germans claim that motorised units have got through, and marshal Tito states that fierce fighting is going on in the town.The liberated areas of Serbia and Montenegro have been united by the capture of three towns S.E. of Sarajevo, and disruption of enemy communicationsthroughout the country has continued.It is believed that there are no longer any Bulgarian divisions in Yugoslavia.Albania.33. Commando forces continue to harass the enemy in the Sarande area.Partisans are attacking enemy columns with increased aggressiveness, particularly on the roads in the Koritsa area.Greece.37. The Allied parachutists who were dropped in the Cape Araxos areawest of Patras on the 23rd have been reinforced by the seaborne landing of another Commando and an infantry battalion and supporting arms.Patras was completely occupied in the early morning of the 4th, over 700troops of a Greek security battalion in this area having previously surrendered to British forces.The Island of Poros, in the gulf of Athens, has been occupied by a BritishCommando and Greek troops.In the Drama area the situation is deteriorating and Bulgarian troops aretaking action against the Greek Capetano guerrillas.General Zervas and General Sarafis, the commanders of the two main Greekguerrilla organisations, have acknowledged the authority of M. Papandreou&apos;sGreek Government which has placed them under command of General Scobie.Burma.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Chin Hills and Chindwiii,38. Leading elements of our troops advancing down the Imphal-TiddimRoad are now only four miles east of Tiddim. Continuing their advance down the Kabaw Valley, East African troops have entered the village of Yesagyo,20 miles north of Kalemyo, and are in contact with the enemy.
China.39. The Japanese have continued their drive down the Hengyang-KweilinRailway. They have made most progress on their left flank and have advancedsouthwards in the direction of Pingic and Patao. The Japanese columns,advancing up the West River, and northwards from the Kwangchowwan area,have virtually made contact.   The airfield at Tangchuk has been captured.Pacific.Palcm Islands.40. On the 29th, U.S. forces landed on two further islands in the PalauGroup Ngesebus and Kongauru. Enemy resistance was slight, and was subduedon Ngesebus within 12 hours. On Kongauru the Japanese garrison fought alittle longer but was defeated within 24 hours of the U.S. landing. Asmall island off the coast of Kongauru has also been invaded and subjected by .S. forces.By the evening of the 27th the wdiole of Peleliu Island was captured. Isolatedpockets of Japanese continue to resist in the hills in the centre of the island.Japanese casualties on Peleliu up to the 27th were 7,517 killed and 103 prisonersof war.Total Japanese casualties on Anguar Island amounted to 1,000 killed and five prisoners of war.Halmaheras.41. About 200 Japanese landed from barges at three points on the east coast of Morotai on the 28th. No contact has so far been reported between thisparty and the TJ.S. forces.AIR SITUATION.General Review.42. Heavy bombers attacked industrial and other targets in Germany, thesea-wall at Walcheren and U-boat pens at Bergen. Other bombers and fightersattacked enemy communications in Germany and Holland.Communications were again heavily attacked in northern Italy and railwaytargets were bombed in southern Germany.United Kingdom.43.

On the 28th, there wasvigorous enemy fighter reaction to the U.S. heavy bombers&apos; operations over germany. Enemy night fighter activity was ori a low scale. Second line Ju. 87were active on night&quot; harassing operations in the Brussels area, although this effort did not generally exceed 15 sorties.
sThe Battle Area.46. Medium and light bombers attacked road crossings and railwayjunctions in the areas of Emmerich, Geldern and Goch, and troops and M.T. con-concentrations S.K. of Arnhem; in these operations some 500 tons of bombs were dropped. About 5,000 sorties were flown on armed reconnaissances by fighters and lighter-bombers of the A.E.A.F. : a further considerable number of sortieswas flown, by fighters of the same command, in providing close support to Alliedground forces and on defensive patrols. On one day, large formations of enemy aircraft were encountered, mainly over the Dutch-German frontier; 33 of these were shot down for the loss of four Spitfires and three Typhoons. In the courseof these tactical operations, mostly carried out over Holland and the GermanRhine area, railway lines were cut in many places and buildings, factories and fuel clumps hit; in addition, about 123 locomotives, 746 units of rolling stock,54 fuel trucks.

Two spans of the Sesto Calende railway bridge(25 miles S.W. of Como) were badly damaged, and four other bridges receiveddirect hits in an attack by 144 medium bombers.A total of over 60 locomotives, 250 railway wagons and 120 M.T. was destroyed or damaged.The Coastal Air Force obtained a number of strikes on shipping in theNorth Adriatic, on one occasion setting fire to a 1,000-ton vessel and a schooneroff Trieste.South-Eastern Europe.52. During the limited number of operations which the Strategic Air force was able to effect, a good concentration wras obtained and a large explosion and fires were seen, when heavy bombers dropped 179 tons on the railway viaduct atBorovnica (40 miles N.N.W. of Sarajevo). On the 4th very good results were obtained also when 712 tons were dropped by Fortresses and Liberators on Munichrailway centre.The Balkan Air Force continued effective attacks on transport, gun positions and troop concentrations in North Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia.Aircraft of the Middle East Command carried out successful operations against shipping in the iEgean, in the course of which three vessels of 250/400tons sustained damage from R.P. and cannon strikes, as did also a number ofcaiques. Twelve enemy transport aircraft were destroyed off Greece for the lossof four fighters from Middle East Command.Russia.53. There was considerable activity by the Russian Air Force, operationsbeing mainly in support of land forces. Aircraft of the Baltic Fleet operatedoffensively on three days. The long-range bomber force restricted its operations,and although, in the area north of Warsaw, tank assembly and repair workshopswere bombed, this is believed to have been effected by the Russian 4th Air Army.Burma.54.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Darmstadt. As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 19th Septemberfurther damage has been caused in the railway goods yard where tracks havebeen cut in four places, some wagons damaged and tracks to the locomotive repairshops also cut. The main weight of the attack has fallen on the industrial and residential area on the east side of the goods yard, where a large motor worksbuilding and several other industrial buildings have been damaged.Gelsenkircken / Nordstern.   The Bomber Command attack of the27th September caused damage in the western half of the synthetic oil plantinvolving the winding engine house, a gas holder, a primary product storage tank,a cooling toaver, offices and four unidentified buildings.Hannover. In addition to damage already reported, photographs now showthat a machine shop and pattern shop in the Hanomeg works, and machine shops and an extruding and press shop in the Vereinigte Leichtmetall-Werke were damaged in the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 11th September.Kaiserslautern. As a result of the Bomber Command attack on the27th/28th September a residential area of 35 blocks in the north-west part of thetown has been destroyed by fire, almost half of the textile works ofKammgarnspinnerei has been wrecked, and there is severe damage to railway workshops involving two avagon shops, a boiler house, a machine house and someoffices.Karlsruhe. The attack by Bomber Command on the 26th/27th Septembercaused avidespread devastation to business and residential property from thecentre of the town to the south-west. Damage to public buildings, barracks andindustrial buildings is A&quot;ery heaa7y.L ud wig shaven. Further damage has been caused to three areas of theI.G. Farben Works as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 21st, 25th and 27thSeptember. Three storage tanks in the Lube oil plant haare been destroyed andtwo other buildinp:s oartla&apos; destroA^ed. In the intermediate and dve stuff areastwo buildings have been damaged, and another in the nitrogen and methanolo o        7 ^plant has been similarly affected.Mainz. As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 27th September the gas avdrks of Kraftwerke Mainz-Wiesbaden, A.G., and industrial premises nearby hare been severely damaged. There is also perious damage to stores on thesouth quay of the Flosshafen, and a rail oaTer road bridge has been destroyed bya direct hit.Munc hen-Glad bach j Rheyt. As a result of the Bomber Command attackon the 19th September, both these towns, avhich were heavily damaged in previousattacks, have received considerable further damage to industrial premises and to residential property, particularly in the districts of Waldhausen, Waklhauser-hohe, and Alsbroich.Neass. As a result of the Bomber Command attack on the 23rcl/24thSeptember, very^severe damage has been inflicted in the dock area. The quaysbetween Danziger Strasse and Hansa Strasse have suffered particularly severely,and nearly all the important buildings have been destroyed or heavily damaged,while ail the rail tracks serving the docks have received many direct hits. Twoboats in the northern dock have been sunk and a barge in the central dockdamaged.Damage has also been caused in the marshalling yard, where t\vo locomotivedepots have been affected and where some tracks have been cut in the sorting-sidings and several wagons damaged or derailed. The Bauer and Schaurtefactory (makers of nuts &quot;and bolts) has received damage and there is scatteredbusiness and residential damage throughout the toavn.Nuremberg. Five industrial concerns in the Lichtenhof district in thesouth-east area of the town received varying degrees of damage as a result of theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 10th September.&quot; The worst affected was the M.A.N.
works (tanks, armoured cars, &amp;c), where several shops suffered partial destructionor severe damage. In addition a number of small unidentified industrial buildings, groups of stores, and some business and residential property in thesame area were destroyed or damaged. The railway tracks running south-East from the main station received at least six hits.&apos;osnabruck. Smoke and haze obscure photographs taken after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 26th September, but extensive fresh damage can beseen to the Klockner Werke (engineering and armaments) and to the marshalling yard. Many hits in the marshalling yard have caused new damage to the goods station, goods shed, and engine round house and turntable, and have derailed and damaged several wagons. The east-west through lines have been cut by manycraters.Buildings of the Klockner Werke which have received fresh damage includethe rolling mills, railroad equipment plant, open hearth plant, foundry and storesbuildings.   There is some damage to residential property in the vicinity.Stuttgart. Further photographs show that the Bomber Command attack- onthe 12th/13th September caused very heavy damage in the centre of the town,while at least 25 entire street blocks, as well as many other buildings, have been gutted. The factory of Robert Bosch in the Feuerbach district received freshdamage, and the Hauff A.G. Works (makers of nitric acid and photographicchemicals) in the same area suffered heavily. In the southern part of the townheavy damage was caused to two other important factories, the AllgemeineElektrizitats (manufacturers of electric tools, &amp;c.) and J. Wizeman (makers ofpiston rings, &amp;c). Many other smaller factories in the city have received varying degrees of damage, while a number of public buildings, including the headPost Office and the Rosenstein Palace, have been affected.The cumulative damage in the area south-west of the main station nowamounts to almost complete devastation.Wetzlar. The U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 19th September caused damagethroughout the Buderwische Eisen werke (Spphienhutte). Almost all thebuildings were affected in varying degrees, including power plants, rolling mills,storage buildings and many large, medium and small workshops.- Wiesbaden. As a result of- the TJ.S.A.A.F. attack on the 19th Septemberconsiderable damage has been inflicted on the chemical and explosive works ofKalle and Co., and Kurt Albert. In the former, the south-western section of the plant in particular has been severely affected, and some buildings have been completely destroyed. In the Kurt Albert Works damage is widespread in thewestern half, and five large and at least three smaller buildings have been heavily damaged, while the storage areas have also been affected.Ladbergen. -The attack by Bomber Command on the night of the 23rd/&apos;24thSeptember on the Dortmund/Ems Canal at this point is seen to have been very successful. Here, the canal, which is in two branches, the old and the new, hasbeen completely cut. In the old branch a heavy bomb has torn away a sectionof the embankment and the canal has drained into the nearby river. 370 yards of the canal is completely dry and impassable. In the new branch a similarbreach has occurred and the section of the canal completely dry is 450 yards. Atthe southern approaches to the target area 13 barges are stationary. The photo-graphs were obtained nine days after tffe original attack.Bremen. The U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 26th September caused severe damage to the machine-shop, foundry and finishing and despatching building of the A.F.V. and M.T. works of Karl F. W. Borgwand in the Sebaldsbriickedistrict. Additional damage was also inflicted on the Hastedt factory of thesame concern and the foundry and heat-treatment and machine-shop were affected. In the Hemelingen district fresh damage was also caused to the FockeWulf components factory. Scattered business and residential damage was caused in the outskirts of Hastedt.Bielefeld. The main weight of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 30th Septemberfell on the East side of the main railway station which skirts the old town, wherewhole blocks of buildings have been gutted. A considerable amount of severe damage has also been caused from the centre to the N.E. as far as, the goods station. Beyond that point and elsewhere in the town scattered damage has been caused. The thermal power station has suffered heavily and the main passenger and goods stations/have been affected, the latter more severely. Four tracks in therailway sidings East of the gasworks have been cut and the line from East
Bielefeld Station to the junction with the main lines have been cut in five places.Among the factories which have been damaged are Koch and Co. (iron founders),Ankerwerke (army motor cycles and small arms ammunition), and Durkopp A.G.(small arms ammunition). A number of fires were still smouldering amongbusiness and residential property in the oil town more than 48 hours after the attack.Hamm. Smoke .from burning buildings renders a detailed assessment of damage impossible, but it can be seen that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 26th and 30th September and the 2nd October fresh damage has been caused to locomotive and repair facilities in the marshalling yard ana to the passenger station through which most of the tracks have been cut. Rolling-stock and small buildings were burning fiercely in the central area of the marshalling yard some three hours after the last attack and manv fires were still rasdngr in the town. Thebridge over the canal and river has received a direct hit in the centre and many others on its approaches.Kassel. Cloud precludes a definite assessment of damage, but it can be seenthat the TJ.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 22nd, 27th and 28th September and the2nd October have caused considerable damage in the area round the HenschelWorks and the marshalling yard. Several buildings of the Henschel locomotiveworks and of the A.F.V. factory of the same concern have been hit and nearly every building in the railway workshops has suffered some damage. A number ofbusiness and residential buildings have also been affected.
