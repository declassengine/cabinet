-       i   ,/      LI.  1THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY .S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Copy No.   36W.P. (44) 557.5th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILL:   THE 1939STANDARD.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.WHEN this matter was last discussed in the War Cabinet (W.M. (44)130th Conclusions, Minute 6), I suggested that if any further concession wereto be made to property owners, it would be found necessary to apply a singleuniform percentage increase.I believe there is a refinement on the suggestion which might go a littlefurther to make it a possible compromise.My suggestion is this : (i) Where undeveloped land is acquired the 1939 price should rule.Undeveloped land would be for this purpose land which had nobuildings upon it or only out-buildings ancillary to a farming purpose,i.e., outshed, pigsty, sheep fold or similar building.   It would not include land with a main farm or farmhouse on it.(ii) In all other cases the price paid would be the 1939 price plus X per cent.X per cent. wrould be derived from an overall calculation taking into account the changed value of money for the purpose of acquiring buildings, that is to say,it would be such as, over the country as a whole, would enable a similar type ofbuilding to be purchased. This might be of the order of 10-20 per cent. Theactual figure to be arrived at wrould give a basis for compromise and bargain.S. C.Ministry of Aircraft Production, S.IF. 1,5th October, 1944.r, o[28349]
