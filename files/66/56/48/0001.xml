Q rJ 9THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT      6 8Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Copy No. OW.P. (44) 598.(      30th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.RECRUITMENT TO THE CIVIL SERVICE DURING THERECONSTRUCTION PERIOD.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.ON the 14th February, 1944 (W.M. (44) 20th Conclusions, Minute 7), theWar Cabinet approved my proposal to make a short statement in the House ofCommons on the subject of recruitment to the Civil Service during the recon-struction period. I made the statement on the 17th February^ and, as indicatedtherein, the Civil Service National Whitley Council was asked to submit detailed proposals to the Government.2. A Committee of the National Whitley Council was appointed for thispurpose, the Official Side members being Sir Alan Barlow (Chairman),Sir Horace Hamilton, Miss E. A. Sharp, Mr. H. Wilson Smith, Sir Arthur Street,Sir Percival Waterfield, and Mr. Arton Wilson, with Miss D. C. L. Hacket as secretary. The Committee has now completed its discussions and drawn up its Report. Its recommendations represent complete agreement between theOfficial Side and the Staff Side of the CounciL,,. Signatures to the Report are nowbeing collected and I propose that it shouldvthen be published in a command paper : a proof copy of the Report is attached to this memorandum.3. The proposals originally put forward by the Official Side had beenapproved in advance by the Machinery of Government Committee. In general,the agreed Report follows the line of those proposals, subject to certain modifi-cations of detail the more important of which were submitted to the Machineryof Government Committee and approved by it on the 29th June.4. The following is a very brief summary of the main recommendations contained in the Report. Open competitive examinations for entry to the estab-lished Civil Service should be resumed as soon as possible after the cessation ofEuropean hostilities. There should be competitions on normal lines for candi-dates who reach the normal ages of entry to the Service as recruitment is reopened,and vacancies arising in the ordinary course of events after that time shouldbe filled by recruits from the normal competitions. To fill the bulk of the substan-tial number of vacancies which have accrued during the war Owing to the suspension of normal competitions, there should be reconstruction competitionsof a simplified type, and those competitions should extend over the whole recon-struction period. The majority (80 per cent.) of the vacancies to be filled fromthe reconstruction competitions should go to candidates who have lost their normal opportunities of competing for the Civil Service by reason of the war,i.e., those who are within &quot; normal age limits plus the period of the war &quot; ; butthere should also be a smaller reservation (20 per cent.) of vacancies for thoseabove &quot; normal age limits plus the period of the war &quot; but not above 30. Thereconstruction competitions should not, as after the last war, be confined almost exclusively to ex-Service men, since the circumstances of this war have been very different from those of the last and the interests of efficiency demand that thefield of candidates shall be as wide as possible; but in order to ensure generoustreatment for ex-Service men and women, minimum reservations of vacanciesshould be guaranteed to them in each class. A small proportion of. the vacancieswhich have accrued during the war should be reserved, outside the reconstruc-* Official Report, cols. 836-8.T284801 b
tion competitions, for temporary Civil Servants over the age of 30, since it is -in the public interest to retain the knowledge and experience of the best of these;and established Civil Servants should have restored to them the oppertuinities which they have lost during the war of competing for higher classes.5. From the point of view of public presentation, the crux of this problemlies in the handling of the ex-Service question. Undoubtedly, there will bedemands for 100 per cent, ex-Service preference, such as existed, to all intentsand purposes, for many years after the last war. A proportion of the House )of Commons,, and probably a larger proportion of the r/ress, may be expectedto lend active and vocal support to those demands. I trust that the War cabinet will be prepared to support, and to maintain against pressure, the view contained in the Recruitment Report and endorsed by the Machinery of Govern-ment Committee that, while generous treatment must be accorded to the claims of the ex-Service candidates, anything like a complete reservation is not onlydetrimental to the efficiency of the Service but unfair to the remainder of thecommunity who have done their duty in this war.6. That the Report does contemplate generous treatment for the ex-Servicecandidate can be seen from the following analysis of its proposals. The Ministryof Labour estimate that approximately 70 per cent, of the appropriate maleage groups are in the Forces. In the pre-war examinations the proportionsbetween successful men and women candidates in the various classes were approximately (a) Clerical Class 60 men/40 women, (b) Executive Class-85 men/15 women, (c) Administrative Class 93 men/7 women. On the assump-tion that women would achieve the same proportionate successes in thereconstruction competitions and that it would be fair to reserve to the ex-Servicemen 70 per cent, of the probable male successes, the reservations would be :(a) Clerical Class, 42 per cent., (5) Executive Class, 59-5 per cent., and (c) Admim-istrative Class, 65-1 per cent. Actually, the Report recommends that the reservations should be 50 per cent., 66f per cent., and 75 per cent, respectively.It must be remembered, moreover, that in free competition the women candidatesin the reconstruction competitions would almost certainly achieve higher propor-tionate successes in all three classes than is suggested by the pre-war figures. to base the reservations for ex-Service men on a substantial rounding up of the dueproportions suggested by the pre-war results makes the Committee&apos;s proposalseven better from the point of view of the ex-Service man. All these reservationsare, of course, subject to the attainment of the appropriate qualifying standardin the reconstruction competitions. As regards ex-Service women, the committee feel that it is less easy to justify a preference on the ground of interruptededucational opportunities or on the ground of the arduous or hazardous natureof their duties. They do, however, agree that there must be no risk that the chances of ex-Service women should be prejudiced in competing against civiliancandidates. The proposal which they make is that ex-Service women, if they reach the appropriate qualifying standard, should have reserved to them theproportion of vacancies (after allowance has been made for the ex-Service men&apos;sguaranteed vacancies) represented by the proportion between the number of ex-Service women candidates and the total number of candidates, other thanex-Service men. There is, of course, nothing to prevent ex-Service candidatesfrom securing more than the reserved number of vacancies if on merit they cansucceed in doing so. Finally, the reconstruction competitions are to be spreadover the whole reconstruction period with the object of securing that the lastman demobilised from the Forces has as good a chance of competing as the firstman released. I have no hesitation in recommending to my colleagues that theseare proposals by which we can, and ought to, stand.7. I should be glad to have the authority of my colleagues for the publicationof the Report and for announcing that the Government accept its recommenda-tions. In order to place the Report in its proper context, I propose that theannouncement of the Governments acceptance of it should include references to other Civil Service problems which are now under consideration. Annexed jto this memorandum is the draft of a question and answer (Annex I) announcing the White Paper and also of a statement (Annex II) which I would proposeto have printed as a preface to the Whitley Council report.

The Minister of Labourand National Service has already announced the Governments plans for the releaseor transfer to civil employment of men and women from the Forces after theconclusion of hostilities in Europe; and while, as he states, general demobilisationcannot take place until the total defeat of the Axis Powers throughout the world,the interests both of the Public Service and of the men and women affected require that any who are released during the interim period should have an immediateopportunity of entering the permanent Civil Service if they wish to do so and are suitable for it.Arrangements for recruitment to the future Civil Service presuppose ageneral conception of the future work of the Service. The responsibilities whichsuccessive Governments will undertake after this war will differ in volume and tosome extent in kind from those which were undertaken before the war. Mean-while, however, as indicated, the opening of recruitment cannot be deferred. Sofar as proves necessary, adjustments can subsequently be made to meet new developments or any. changes in the structure of the Service.In the adjustment of the Civil Service to new developments and newdemands the training is also a matter of primary importance. The report of acommittee under the Chairmanship of the Financial Secretary to the treasury on the training of civil servants after the war has been presented in a previous white Paper (Cmd. 6525). While the proposals in that report have still to be worked out in detail, the Government accept the recommendations in principle.They believe that the recruitment and training reports taken together will conduceto maintaining at the highest level of efficiency a Service which must, undersuccessive Governments, undertake tasks of growing difficulty and variety in theyears to come.It will be observed that both these reports are written almost entirely round the administrative, executive and clerical classes of the Civil Service. That is partly because these classes compose and must continue to compose the mainstream of the Civil Service, and partly because they are more or less homogeneous.But the professional, scientific and technical classes of the Civil Service, althoughless numerous, are equally important; and it is certainly of equal importance[28480] b 2
that well-qualified men and women should be recruited to these classes in thepost-war years, and should be given proper opportunities and encouragement for making their special contribution.Departments employing these staffs are now engaged in formulatingproposals for them which will, as far as possible, incorporate the principlesalready recommended for the general classes. This, is not a simple problem.Necessarily, the precise arrangements to be made for securing to the public serviceappropriately qualified scientists, medical officers, lawyers, economists,statisticians, architects, engineers, surveyors, &amp;c, differ from profession toprofession. Further, the range of worK in the different Departments covered bythese various grades is very wide and varied, with the result that the applicationof common principles is an exceedingly difficult matter. It is, however, expectedthat the matter will shortly be sufficiently advanced for discussion with CivilService staff representatives to take place through the Whitley machinery.The Government have decided to retain after the war a central body ofeconomists and statisticians such as has been set up in the Cabinet Offices duringthe war.Preparatory work is also being undertaken on other questions affecting thefuture Civil Service. Discussions are taking place in the National whitley council on a number of problems that will arise on redundancy as the work of departments contracts, and on the question whether any changes require to bemade in the main structure of the Service, that is to say, the grades and classes,the methods of passing from one class to another, and the general arrangementsdesigned to secure that the best use is made of all members of the staff.Preliminary consideration has also been given to the question whetherthe existing superannuation arrangements are sufficiently flexible, to the positionof unestablished staff and to the effect of the new social insurance scheme on thepensions of the Public Services.On these questions further statements will be made as may prove to benecessary.

CIVIL SERVICE NATIONAL WHITLEY COUNCILCommittee on the Staffing of the Civil Service duringthe Reconstruction PeriodREPORT ON RECRUITMENT TO ESTABLISHEDPOSTS   IN   THE   RECONSTRUCTION   period. The Committee was appointed in accordance with the governments request, announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the House ofCommons on 17th February, 1944, that the National Whitley Council should submit to them specific proposals on recruitment to the Civil Service in theimmediate post-war period. The proposals contained in this Report havebeen agreed between the Official Side and the Staff Side of the Council,and are submitted accordingly.2. So far, we have considered the problems of post-war recruitment inrelation only to the non-professional and non-technical classes of the Service;that &quot;is, to the administrative, executive, clerical and sub-clerical classes,including Departmental variants of these classes. These, by long-settled policy, are recruited through the Civil Service Commission, and form acoherent unit. Before the war they comprised more than three-quarters ofthe whole Service, and more than four-fifths of the established Service,if one excludes the minor and manipulative (mainly Post - Office) grades.We hope shortly to extend our consideration to the professional, scientific and technical classes, which, though smaller, are equally important.I.    PRELIMINARY3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his statement of 17th Februarythat, after the war, the established Civil Service would need the substantialreinforcement of a steady flow of young recruits of good educationalstandards; and that, in the Governmenfs view, it should be an immediateobjective to resume normal competitions at the earliest possible moment,and thus to recruit properly qualified personnel at ages appropriate to entryon a permanent career.4. This has been our starting point. It is hardly necessary for us toset out the arguments; but perhaps we may say that all who have beenfamiliar with the Civil Service in the inter-war years, and during this war,are deeply conscious of the unhappy effects of unplanned recruitment irnme-diately after the last war, and of the failure to maintain sufficiently high standards of qualification. This time the system of open competitiveexaminations for entry to the established Civil Service must be reopened assoon as possible after the cessation of European hostilities; that is, as soonas sufficient candidates from among men and women in the Forces, as wellas from among those in war industry and other civilian occupations, become available.5. Before the war, the Civil Service set out to draw its recruits to thenon-professional and non-technical classes direct from schools and universities-ties at the three main educational levels above the elementary; to the olericaland sub-clerical classes at age 16 to 17 (except that a higher age limit was&apos;allowed for typists and shorthand typists), to the executive class at age18 to 19, and to the administrative class at age 21 to 24. (The,.Post office has its own arrangements for recruiting boy messengers and girl probationers
(jelc-w the age of 16.) For the purpose of this Report we take the system as we find it; noting that the precise ages at which recruitment will be feasible in future may require modification if it should be decided to retainany period of compulsory national service after&apos; the war.6. The proposals which follow assume, for purposes of illustration, thatEuropean hostilities will cease at the end of 1944, i.e. after the war haslasted for just over five years. The validity of, the principles which werecommend does not, however, depend in any way upon the ending ofhostilities at any particular date. To apply these principles to a differentdate, only an alteration of the age limits will be needed.7. After the war there will be a very large number of vacancies in the established Civil Service. In the four main classes covered by this Report,there were in April, 1939, 125,000 established officers; in July, 1944, only99,500 were in pest. Some thousands were absent on war service, but even allowing for them, the numbers had appreciably, shrunk. In addition,a number of those at present serving are near or over 60 and will retire very soon after the end of European hostilities. Provision may also have to bemade for new services, and for the expansion of some existing, services.It is very difficult at this stage to form any reliable estimate of the post-war size of the permanent Service, but some estimate will have to be made,as a preliminary to the actual work of reconstruction, and we understandthat the Treasury have this in hand. Further, the estimate will have to be reviewed from time to time, a final review being made towards the end ofthe reconstruction period. For our immediate purposes, it is sufficient to record that, on any basis, there will be, after the end of European hostilities,a great many vacancies in the established Service; those that have accruedduring the war by wastage and by permanent expansion (to which we referhereafter as the &quot; accrued vacancies &quot;), and those that will begin to accrueimmediately after the war in the normal course of events (to which werefer as the &quot; normal vacancies &quot;).8. To fill these vacancies, there are two main sources of recruitment:young men and women who reached the normal age of competing for theCivil Service during the war years, when entry to the established service was closed; and the young men and women of the future, who reach thenormal ages as recruitment is reopened. The Chancellor of the exchequer said in his statement: &quot; It appears to the Government only equitable, sofar as the Civil Service is concerned, that the main source of recruits inthe immediate post-war period should be from those who would have hadan opportunity of competing for .the Service in the normal course, butfor the interruption of the war&quot;; and he added: &quot; Recruitment by opencompetition from this source, under conditions which will allow for the interruption of a candidate&apos;s education, and concurrent resumption of thenormal competitions, will serve very well the main object of securing a steady flow of appropriately qualified personnel- during the reconstructionperiod.&quot; We have accordingly taken it to be our main task to consider how recruitment from these sources can best be carried out.&apos;II.   RECONSTRUCTION COMPETITIONS- 9. It is necessary first to try to visualize the conditions in which recon-struction will take place. As indicated, we hope that open competitionswill be resumed as soon as sufficient potential candidates are released fromthe Forces, as well as from war industry and other civilian occupations.But release will inevitably be a protracted process; and may, if war in the37877 A 2
Far East continues for some time after the cessation of European hostilities, )have to be spread over several years. Any arrangements must , aim at sercuring that the last man released has, if he wants At, as.good a chance of competing for the Civil Service as the first. We therefore contemplate that the reconstruction competitions (i.e. the competitions designed priq-cipally for candidates who missed their opportunity because of the war)should consist of a series of - examinations extending over a period of several years; and that only a &quot;proportion of the total accrued vacancies which areto be made available to the whole reconstruction&apos; group should be allocated to each examination. In order that the later candidates shall not foe ata disadvantage in pay, all candidates should enter the salary scale of theirgrade at points corresponding to their ages at the-date of appointment,Normal age limits plus the period of the war10. As already stated, the main source of recruitment in the immediate post-war period should be those who have missed their opportunity of com-competing for the Civil Service because of the interruption of the war; that isto say those within the normal age limits for recruitment to the Civil Serviceplus (on the assumption in paragraph 6) five years or such longer period asthe process of release entails in particular cases. But this should not bethe only source; and we later propose some extension of these age limitsin the interests of older people seeking resettlement, and also in the interestsof the Service, which will need to retain some of its experienced temporary staff. The bulk of the accrued vacancies should, however, go to those whohave &quot; come of age &quot; during the war.ii. Those who have thus &quot; come of age &quot; will be as follows:  Candidates eiigibiefor the administrative class :     Aged 21* to 29 inclusive in 1945Candidates eligible for the executive class : Aged 18* to 24 inclusive in 1945Candidates eligible for the clerical and sub-      Aged 16* to 22 inclusive in 1945clerical classes : (We do not propose repetitionhere of the age extension fortypists &amp; shorthand-typists)Candidates up to 3012. On consideration, we have come to the conclusion that a rigid adher-ence to the upper age limits set out above would not toe justified. Theremay, we think, be many men and women whose lives have been com- -pletely upset by the war and who, although they did not choose to enter the established Civil Service before the war, might welcome an opportunityof doing so now. Provided that they are still young enough to be trained in a new career and this is most important to the efficiency of the Service we think that a number of candidates rather above the ages set out inparagraph 11 could be recruited with advantage to the Service, as well asto themselves; and we accordingly propose that a proportion of the accruedvacancies should be allotted to candidates above these ages but not aboveage 30. The allotment to this source of recruitment should, we think, be one vacancy to every four of those allotted to the younger age groups(within &quot; normal age limits plus five&quot;); and successful candidates in the older groups should be placed in a separate order of merit from those inthe younger groups. A separate allotment for the &quot; up to 30&apos;s &quot; wouldnot, however, be appropriate in the administrative class, where the upperage limit &quot;for the younger group is 29; and we suggest instead one examina-tion and one order of merit for all candidates not older than 30.* but see paragraph 53 below on a modification of these minimum ages.
9 rJ&amp; 2Method of recruitment13. The method of recruitment to the administrative, executive, clericaland sub-clerical classes of the Civil Service has for many years been bywritten competitive examination, plus an interview in the case of the adminis-trative class and of some of the Departmental classes. We do not propose any general alteration in this system as applied to candidates coming forward from schools and Universities for the normal competitions, though for these,candidates three particular changes are suggested, see paragraph 54 below.14. For the reconstruction competitions, however, substantial modifica-tion will be needed in the normal system, since few of the candidates willbe equipped to face examinations in school or University subjects. Wethink that for them the Civil Service Commission should design a written examiniation in general subjects, including intelligence tests if these are considered to be appropriate after investigation by the Commissioners; andthat for the administrative and executive classes and for correspondingDepartmental classes there should be, in addition, an interview. We havenot thought it necessary ourselves to enquire into the possibility of; introducingmodern methods of selection, on the lines, for example, of the techniquedeveloped during the war by the Army through the War Office SelectionBoards; but we understand that the Civil Service Commissioners are givingtheir attention to this question, with reference particularly to the administrativeolass. Further, since written examination papers of the kind which, reconstrac-tion candidates could be asked to take will not be very reliable indications of the candidate&apos;s general educational attainment,. we think that some prioreducational qualification ought to be required, and we propose the follow-ing:-Administrative class:For candidates who have taken a University degree, at least SecondClass Honours; an external degree of this standard will count. For thosewho have not taken a degree, full-time education up to age 18 and atleast one year&apos;s continuous full-time attendance at a University,, with a recommendation from the educational authorities of University and/orschool that the candidate would have been expected to attain at leastSecond Class Honours standard. The year&apos;s University attendance mayhave taken place either before war service, or after termination of that service in accordance with general resettlement plans.Executive class:Full-time education up to age 17, or, alternatively, the possession of aHigher School Certificate or equivalent educational qualification.Clerical class:Full-time education up to age 16, or, alternatively, the possession of a school Certificate or equivalent educational qualification. Specializededucation of the commercial college type should be allowed to count. (Butsee paragraph 43 below.)Sub-clerical class:Full-time education up to age 15, specialized education of the commer-cial college type again being allowed to count. (But see paragraph 43below.)(Candidates for typing or shorthand posts will ibe required to take papers in those subjects; but certificates of the Royal Society of Arts of 50 wordsper minute typing or 120 words per minute shorthand should confer,exemption.)We think that no candidate should be allowed more than two attempts at any. one reconstruction competition, though a candidate who is eligible
by age and educational attainments to compete for more than one class maycompete twice for each class for which he is eligible.15. We would refer here to the recommendation made in the Report ofthe Committee on the Training of Civil Servants (Cmd. 6525) that the probation served by every new recruit ought to be more real than at present,and that recruits who show no aptitude for Civil Service work should, intheir own as much as in the national interest, leave the Service. Thissuggestion applies with particular force to the reconstruction recruits becauseof the special method of their selection.The position of ex-Service men and women16. In the preceding paragraphs we have dealt only with age and educa-tional qualifications. A further question is whether competition betweencandidates in the appropriate age groups and with the appropriate qualifica-tions is to be free; or whether there is to be after this war, as after the last,an ex-Service preference.17. For some time after the last war, ex-Service men enjoyed an almost complete preference for established posts. Reconstruction competitions were held in the immediate post-war period for the administrative and executiveclasses, candidature being practically confined to ex-Service men, and normalopen competitions were not held until 1925 for the administrative class, 1928for the executive. Recruitment to the clerical classes was a continuousprocess, but again recruitment was practically confined to ex-Service men,and in the main tp ex-Service men already in temporary government service, who were selected for established service through the Lytton andSouthborough competitions. Normal open competitions for the clerical classeswere not held until 1927.18. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that &quot; any arrangements madefor recruitment to the Civil Service immediately after the war should ensurethat generous treatment is given to suitable candidates from the Forces.&quot;It was primarily with ex-Service men in mind that we recommended, inparagraph 12 above, an extension to age 30 of the maximum age limits for reconstruction candidates. In our view, however, &quot; generous treatment &quot;implies more than this, and points to some form of guaranteed reservationfor ex-Service candidates, in order that they may be at some advantagecompared with their civilian competitors.19. We accordingly propose that, while the competitions should be thrownopen to all candidates who have the necessary educational qualifications, a proportion of the vacancies available in each reconstruction competitionshould be guaranteed to ex-Service men, provided, of course, that a minimumqualifying standard is attained. A guarantee, as a minimum, of a propor-tion of vacancies equal to the proportion of potential candidates actually inthe Forces would ensure that ex-Service men were at no disadvantage. Wewould propose that the proportions guaranteed should be higher than this,so that the treatment should be generous.20. We put forward this scheme (of which we give details below) only after considering most carefully what measure of preference for ex-Servicecandidates is called for under the conditions of the present war. We have described the almost exclusive preference for ex-Service candidates which prevailed last time. It is, however, necessary to bear in mind the essential difference between the circumstances of the two wars. In this war therehas been total mobilization, and men and women have done as they havebeen directed; whether it has been to join the Armed Forces or the Women&apos;forces, to work in industry, to take part in Civil Defence, to enter temporary
Government service, or to carry on the services essential to the civiliancommunity. In this war, too, those who have stayed at home have had their share of danger and discomfort.. In view of the part which civilianshave played, public opinion would never, we believe, accept their exclusion from the opportunity to compete for posts in the Civil Service during thereconstruction period.21. The interest of the nation in the efficiency&apos; of its Public Service hasalso to be considered. This interest requires that the Service shall have thebest candidates it can get; and to impose anything like an exclusive ex-Servicepreference must adversely affect the standard by seriously reducing the potential field of candidates. Nor does it stop at this. Once the Govern-ment is committed to such a preference, it ceases to be possible to pay asmuch regard to the suitability of the individual as is desirable in the national interest. This is what happened last time. The Public Service could not asecond time afford the experience of the inter-war period without harm tothe whole community; and for the reasons we have given there is no case for requiring it to do so. We believe that our scheme of reserved vacancieswill ensure generous treatment for ex-Service candidates, while maintaining the necessary standards of the Civil Service.22. Two factors determine the appropriate reservation of vacancies forex-Service men in any group of competitions. First, the proportion of thetotal male population in the age groups concerned which is actually in theForces; and in particular the proportion of the male population of the educa-tional type required. We understand from the Ministry of Labour that about70 per cent, of the men in the non-manual classes (who are the potentialcandidates for the general Civil Service classes) are in the Forces.23. The figure of 70 per cent, refers, however, only to the proportion ofall male candidates represented by the men in the Services. We must haveregard in the second place, therefore, to the normal division of total vacancies in the various classes between men and women. In the years before the war,93 per cent, of the open competition vacancies in the administrative classwere filled by men, 7 per cent, by women; 84 per cent, of those in the executiveclass by men, 16 per cent, by women; 62 per cent, of those in the clericalclass by men, 38 per cent, by women. It follows that with men and womencompeting together, as it is settled Government policy that they should, the proportionate reservation for ex-Service men must, in fairness to both sexes,be smaller in the clerical class than in the executive or the administrative.24. Ex-Service Men. Taking these two factors together we propose thefollowing minimum reservations for ex-Service men in each group of recon-struction competitions:Administrative Three-quarters.Executive Two-thirds.Clerical One-half.(The sub-clerical class to be recruited from these competitions is whollyfemale.)These reservations would carry out the Chancellor&apos;s intention, which weshare, that the treatment given to the ex-Service men should be not only fair but generous.25. Ex-Service Women. There remains the position of ex-Service women.It is less easy to justify a preference for them on the ground of interruptededucational opportunities, or on the ground of the arduous or&apos; hazardousnature of their duties. Nevertheless we agree that there must be no risk that their chances may be prejudiced in competing against civilian candi-dates.   We propose, therefore, that ex-Service women should have reserved
to them,. after, allowance has been made for the ex-Service men&apos;s guarantee,. )vacancies, a proportion of the remaining vacancies in each class corresponding to the proportion of ex-Service women among the remaining candidates otherthan ex-Service men candidates, subject always, of course, to the qualifyingstandard.26. If either ex-Service men or ex-Service women obtain, in free competi-tion, more vacancies than those reserved to them under these proposals,they will, of course, be entitled to them. Civilian men and women, on theother hand, will not be able to encroach on the vacancies reserved for ex-Service candidates, unless the ex-Service candidates fail to reach the minimumqualifying standard in sufficient numbers. Thus, both ex-Service men andwomen will have a substantial advantage over their civilian competitors.27; We suggest that the definition of &quot; ex-Service &quot; for the purpose ofthe reconstruction competitions should include all services which are sodenned in the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944, i.e., the armed forces, the corresponding Women&apos;s Services, and the Merchant Navy and mercantile Marine.28. Ex-Regulars. Before the war candidates for open competitions whohad served as regular members of the Armed. Forces were allowed, for thepurpose of the age-limits, to deduct from their actual age any time spent insuch service. This arrangement should apply to the reconstruction competi-tions. We intend to discuss later the possibility of providing for the annualrecruitment of a small number of ex-regulars to the clerical class as a normalarrangement.29. Prisoners of War. We think that specially sympathetic consideration should be given to the position of prisoners of war, who may need to beallowed to take their examination rather later than other demobilized men.Summary30. Our proposals so far may be summed up thus. The great bulk ofthe vacancies which have accrued by wastage and expansion up to the date when recruitment to the established Civil Service is reopened should be thrown open for,competition as follows:	Age* in 1945	Qualification	Method of Selection	Ex-Service reservationAdministrative Executive   ...

Temporary Civil Servants y31. Any temporary civil servant, whatever his rank, who is within the age limits referred to above, i.e. is within the &quot; normal age limits plus the periodof the war &quot;, or is not more than 30, will have to take the appropriate ex-amination in order to secure an established post. We propose no preferentialreservation of vacancies for such candidates.32. Temporary Officers in Higher Grades In the senior ranks, however,there are older temporary civil servants who have shown outstanding ad-miristrative or executive &quot;ability, and have acquired invaluable experience.There are some, too, who brought with them into the Service a special know-ledge or experience which is of particular utility to their Department. We donot think that the Service can afford to lose all of these, and accordingly we propose that the best of those over 30 who are willing to stay should beretained and established. We do not think that this should apply below the grade of Principal ( 8oo- i,ioo) in the administrative class, or analogousgrades in the executive or Departmental classes, or at all in the clericalclass. At those levels establishment ad hoc would not-be sufficiently important in the public interest to justify infringement of the normal rule of opencompetition.33. As regards temporary Principals, and executive or other officers oncorresponding salary scales, we propose that Departments should nominateindividuals certified by the Head of the Department to have shown exceptionaladministrative or executive ability, or to possess special qualifications or special experience which it would be difficult to replace, and that candidates,nominated should then be interviewed by the Civil Service Commission-toensure that they are up to the high standard contemplated. We think that inany event a maximum quota to be filled from this source should be fixed:for each of the grades in question, and that if more candidates are recom-mended than&apos;the quotas allow for they should be placed in order of meritand only the best retained. If the Commission do not consider that enoughcandidates of outstanding quality are forthcoming, the quotas should notbe taken up. &apos;34. For the most senior temporary officers, of Assistant Secretary (or corre-sponding executive). grade and&apos; above, a competitive interview would hardly be appropriate; and for them we recommend that the Treasury and the Civil-Service Commission in consultation should receive nominations from Depart-ments, determine the number to be retained, and after making what further enquiries or conducting what interview they think fit, jointly agree the cases in which establishment may properly be granted. The number of cases inthis category would be few-.35. Temporary Officers&apos;in Junior Grades.So far, we have made no pro-vision for- the establishment of any temporary civil servant who is over theage of 30, unless he is of Principal or analogous rank, or above. We thinkthat some provision should be1 made. There are at present very many thousands of older men and women doing the.work of the&apos; Civil Service in temporary posts, and&apos; Departments will not be able to dispense with theservices of all of these for a long time after the cessation&quot; of Europeanhostilities, since much of the work is - permanent, and-it will be years beforesufficient of the new reconstruction recruits are available and able to replaceIhem. Moreover in many cases the temporary staff, even though in juniorposts, have acquired a knowledge and1 experience which is most valuable,and which the Service could ill afford to lose. Departments generally, we areinformed, are anxious to see the best of-the older people among their temporalexecutive and: clerical staff retained as established officers in&quot;the basic grades of those classes
IO\ 36. Provision should accordingly be made for some of the older temporarycivil servants to be established in basic grades; and we recommend thai; a proportion of the accrued vacancies in the junior executive and juniorclerical grades should be reserved for the best of the available temporary staff between.the ages of 30 and 50.* We do not extend this recommendation to the junior administrative (Assistant Principal) grade, since this is, in aspecial sense, a training grade, and older men and women do not, in general,make suitable recruits to it. The vacancies reserved in the junior clericalgrade should be open to temporary clerks only, and-the vacancies reserved inthe junior executive grade should be open to temporary staff in the executivefield not provided for in paragraphs 32-34 above and to temporary AssistantPrincipals who are too old to compete in the open reconstruction competitions.37. After looking at the number of temporary staffs at present in post who might be candidates for establishment under the foregoing proposals, we have come to the conclusion that the number to be established should be 15 percent, of the accrued vacancies available in the basic clerical and executivegrades respectively, provided that sufficient candidates reach a qualifyingstandard of ability to perform the work.38. It is a question whether the most appropriate method of selecting thetemporary officers to be retained under this proposal would be by some formof examination conducted by the Civil Service Commission, or by Depart-mental recommendation based on knowledge of the officer&apos;s work. The latter course appeals as more sensible for older staff who have been some time onthe job, but has its- disadvantages in the known difficulties in the big Depart-ments of securing reliable and comparable reports on the work of individuals in junior positions. On the whole we have come to the conclusion that De-departmental recommendation should be the method adopted. To be considered,staff should have had at least two years&apos; continuous service with the Govern-ment, including any intervening period on war service in any of the Servicesmentioned in paragraph 27. We. propose that the 15 per cent, quotas shouldbe divided between temporary staff aged 30 to 40, and those aged 40 to 50, t in proportion to the numbers of candidates from those two age groups, in orderto spread the age distribution. Every Department would contribute its dueproportion towards the quotas, even though unable to absorb them itselfbecause of contraction. In that event the staff selected would be allocated to other Departments.39. The above paragraphs relate to temporary officers in post in Govern-ment service at the conclusion of European hostilities. But considerationmust also be given to the case of the ex-Service man or woman who eitherwas in temporary employment in the Civil Service before war service andreturns to it, or comes in to a temporary post in the Civil Service for thefirst time on the conclusion of war service. We clearly must safeguard the rightof such ex-Service candidates over the age of 30 to a chance at least equal tothat enjoyed by those whose national service has been in a civilian capacity.40. During the reconstruction period, the Civil Service will inevitablycarry a large temporary fringe, especially in the clerical classes. Therehas always been a large temporary fringe to these classes even in mormal times; though after reconstruction determined efforts should be made to reduce* Officers above the age of 50 but not above 55 should be allowed to deduct from theiractual age the amount of any prior service which is reckonable for pension purposes(temporary service normally reckoning as to half).f See footnote to paragraph 36.
txthe size of the fringe, and to handle more effectively both the recruitment andthe treatment of such long-service temporary clerks as must be employed.In the reconstruction period a large, though dwindling, temporary clericalfringe will be unavoidable; and a part of this fringe will be composed of ex-Service men and women, over the age of 30. They will have a very strong claim to be given a chance of securing establishment on their merits,of the same kind as is proposed under the preceding paragraphs for tem-porary clerks over that age who are in post when competitions are opened.41. We think that this claim should be met by recruiting in two phasesduring the reconstruction period to the 15 per cent, of the accrued clericalvacancies which is to be allotted to temporary clerks over 30. Since thebulk of the qualified candidates will be available at the outset, the bulk ofthe 15 per cent., as initially estimated, should be filled early in the recon-struction period; the balance being held in reserve to be competed.for, towards&quot;the end of the period, by the ex-Service temporary clerks who only becomequalified to compete during the interval. There may then also be availablefor this purpose, as for other reconstruction purposes, any extra vacanciesresulting from the review (contemplated in paragraph 7 above) of Jtheinitial estimate of &quot; Accrued &quot; vacancies. These candidates should havehad the qualifying period of two years&apos; continuous service, including war service, mentioned in paragraph 38 and at least one year of it should havetaken place before the conclusion of hostilities in Europe.42. The same problem does not arise in the executive class. The tem-porary fringe to this class, which at present is not much larger than the established cadre, will dwindle far more^quickly than the clerical, where thefringe is nearly three times the size- of the established cadre. recruitment of temporary staff for executive work, which has never been usual in mormal times, should not continue after the cessation of hostilities; and accordingly the first review for establishment of temporary staffs in the junior executivegrade should cover all the potential material.43. We do not propose that any quota of the accrued vacancies in the clerical assistant class should be allocated to temporary staff. We recommend,however, that Departments should be allowed to nominate suitable, membersof the temporary typing grades, aged between 30 and 50,* for establishment in the corresponding permanent grades. Clerk-typists and clerk-shorthand-typists should be eligible for establishment in this way and not by means of-the clerical class quota. The number of the accrued typing vacancies tobe filled in this way is not likely to be large; the actual number should besettled by further discussion between the Official and Staff Sides after theCivil Service Commission has considered, the quality of those nominated.44. Juveniles. We make one further proposal for temporary civil servants.During the war some hundreds of young people aged 14 and 15 have entered the Civil Service in temporary posts, and many have given good service.We propose that the minimum educational qualifications for the reconstruc-tion competitions for the clerical and sub-clerical classes (see paragraph 14above) should be waived for any juvenile temporary civil servant (otherthan those in Post Office juvenile grades, whose normal avenue of advance-ment is in the Post Office Departmental classes) who has left school early to enter the Civil Service, and who is recommended by his or her Depart-ment to the Civil Service Commission as being a suitable competitor foran established post. Such candidates will have no preference in the corn-petition&apos; itself; only in respect of the prior educational requirements:* See footnote to paragraph 36.
Established Civil1 Servants ^45. The only question that arises on civil servants established before thewar is whether they should be allowed to enter the reconstruction corn-petitions for a class higher than that in which they at present serve. Beforethe war, there were two methods by which an established civil servant couldtransfer from a lower class to a higher: he could sit for the open competition,or he could, usually rather later, receive a straight promotion. If he satfor the open competition, he normally received an &quot;added years&quot; con-cession, which enabled him to take the examination two years older than was permitted to candidates from outside the Service. Thus a boy whohad entered the Civil Service by the clerical class at the age of 16 couldsit for the executive competition provided he was between the ages of 18and 20 inclusive, or for the administrative competition provided he was between the ages of 21 and 25 inclusive. In practice about a third of theexecutive open competition successes were attained by serving civil servants,though very few of the administrative class successes, since the standard ofthis competition was at minimum that of a good Second Class Honoursdegree.46. On the basis of restoring opportunities which have been interrupted bythe war, as contemplated in the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement(see paragraph 8), there is an equitable case for allowing established civilservants (many of whom, of course, have been absent on war service) to sit for the reconstruction competitions, notwithstanding that they are alreadyinside the Civil Service, provided that they are within normal age limits, plus the normal two &quot; added years &quot;, plus the period of the war. They could thuscompete for appointment to. a class higher than the one in which they arealready serving.   We recommend that they should be allowed to do so.47. There is a difficulty here, however, in that we are proposing that theCivil Service Commission should insist on minimum educational qualifka-tions as a condition of entry to the various examinations, and in very few cases will the established civil servant have the qualifications required either for the executive or for the administrative reconstruction competition. Thus,the established clerical officer is unlikely to have continued full-time educa-fion up to age 17, since by that time he has usually taken up his CivilService post, and in very few cases can he have obtained the Higher SchoolCertificate/-or equivalent qualification. We think that the best way of meeting this position will be for quotas of the accrued vacancies in theexecutive and administrative classes to be allocated to limited competitionsfor established civil servants. In fixing these quotas regard will have to bepaid to the proportions of vacancies which established civil servantsnormally won in the open competitions before the war, and also to the num-bers of promotions which have taken place during the war. The limitedcompetitions should be of the same general type as we have proposed inparagraph 14 for the general body of reconstruction candidates.48. We do not think that established civil servants should be eligible to take part in the open competitions for candidates up to 30 (see para-graph 12), which, are intended for older men and women outside the Serviceseeking re-settlement; but instead we. propose reasonably, high upper age.limits for the limited competitions.49. Junior Executive Officers.-Fov the executive class, it should-be open toany established officer aped between 18 and 30 to send&apos;in his&apos;or her nameas a. candidate for the limited competition. Officers who have already received acting promotion to the junior executive grade will not be excluded,in view of their liability to reversion. Every effort should be made to&apos;determine the permanent cadre in this grade as soon as possible, havingregard to the numbers of vacancies which must be allotted to the open
( econstruction, the normal and the limited competitions, and to warn theofficers who will have to revert, so that those within the age-limits may, ifthey-choose, enter for the limited competition. No officer should be allowedto enter unless the employing Department certifies that he or she is regardedas worthy of consideration; but in any case where the Department is doubtful,e.o-. because the officer has been absent on war service, he should beigiven thebenefit of the doubt. (Any candidate under 27 with the requisite educationalqualification can of course sit for the open reconstruction competition.)50. Assistant Principals. For the administrative class, the selection ofpersons to compete should be made by employing Departments. We furtherpropose that no officer who has received acting promotion to the AssistantPrincipal grade since the outbreak of war and has not been promoted toPrincipal should be confirmed, unless lie or she is selected through the limitedcompetition. This means that all posts at present held by acting AssistantPrincipals promoted since the 3rd September, 1939, which are decidedto be permanent posts, &quot;will be included in the quota of vacancies to be madeavailable in this grade to established civil servants; Every acting AssistantPrincipal Of whatever age should be eligible for the limited competition ifrecommended by the employing Department. Other candidates should benot older than 35. (Any under 32 with the requisite educational qualificationcan of course sit for the open reconstruction competition.) &apos; &apos;51. &quot;Minor and Manipulative staffs. Before the war there were limitedcompetitions by which minor and manipulative staffs (mainly of the PostOffice) could compete for a fixed quota of the vacancies in the basic clericalgrade. Many of these younger members of the minor and manipulativegrades are in the Forces, and the opportunities of advancement by this method which these staffs have lost during the war should be restored on reconstruction. This will mean fixing, appropriate age limits, and an app.ro-priate quota, and holding a limited competition or series of competitions.Summary of proposals for allocating the &quot; accrued vacancies &quot; *52. We regret that we are not able to give here a complete statement showing the actual numbers of vacancies to be.allotted, under our proposals,to the various categories of candidates; but, as indicated in paragraph 7,the total number of the &quot; accrued vacancies &quot; is itself uncertain at present,depending as it does on unknown factors, including Parliamentary decisionsyet to he taken which may affect the size of the post-war Civil Service.Another uncertain factor is added by the impossibility of forecasting exactly in what proportions candidates will come forward in each category. The beststatement we can give is as follows.(i) Open reconstruction competitions__Subject to the reservations in (ii),(iii), (iv) and (v) below the bulk of the accrued vacancies for permanent staffin;the general Service classes should be filled by open competition amongcandidates within &quot;normal age limits plus the period of the war&quot;, and among candidates above those ages but not above 30, with reservations forex-Service candidates: see table in paragraph 30.(ii) Senior administrative and executive grades. A small reservation ofaccrued vacancies in Principal and analogous executive grades and above should&quot; be filled by ad-hoc selection from senior temporary: Civil Servants inthose grades.(iii) -Basic administrative and executive grades. A srb all reservation ofaccrued vacancies in basic administrative and executive grades (the formerto include all posts held by acting Assistant Principals promoted in war)should be filled by limited competition from established civil servants of lower grades.
(iv) Basic executive and clerical grades. 15 per cent, of accrued vacancies in basic.executive and clerical grades should be filled by Departmental selectionfrom temporary civil servants between 30 and 50*; with an additional reserva-tion in the clerical grade, to be filled by limited competition from minor andmanipulative staffs who have lost normal opportunities of advancement tothis grade.(v). Typing grades. A small reservation of accrued vacancies in typinggrades should be filled by individual selection of suitable temporary typingm staff between 36 and 50*. . 9III.   RESUMPTION OF NORMAL COMPETITIONS53. Normal competitions should be reopened as nearly as possible concur-rently with the opening of the first reconstruction competitions. This isvitally important to the future health of the Service, and we are glad to note that it was visualized in the statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Candidates should be recruited through these competitions in numberssufficient to fill the &quot; normal vacancies &quot;; i.e. those arising after the endof European hostilities in the normal course of events. All candidates coming forward to a competition straight from school (or, later on, as university education is resumed, from University) should be required to take a competi-tive examination of normal type; and to that extent the age limits set out inparagraphs n and 30, as applying to candidates for open reconstruction com-petitions, have to be modified.Proposed alterations in normal methods of recruitment54. Three particular changes are proposed in the normal methods of recruitment from among candidates coming forward in the ordinary coursefrom schools and Universities:(i) Official Side representatives recommend, on the advice of the CivilService Commission, the introduction of an interview as part of the examina-tion for the executive class. Staff Side representatives, whilst recognizingthe value of an interview for the allocation of successful candidates to the. most suitable work, are not convinced of its utility or desirability as partof the machinery of selection. They do not, however, dissent from its introduction, subject to the condition, with which the Official Side agree,that it shall be regarded as an experimental measure, to be reviewed after a period of five years.(ii) The introduction for a proportion of vacancies in the administrative class of a system of selection by the Civil Service Commission by interview,record, and a few written tests of a general character. The normal methodof selecting administrative candidates is by a long and arduous written examiniation, coupled with an interview which plays a large, but notnecessarily a.decisive, part in the result. This method would be continued for the majority of administrative vacancies; but the Civil Service Corn-mission are of opinion that some candidates of high quality would befound by the competitive interview method, who might not be found by the written examination method. This proposal is experimental, and should be closely watched, and reviewed after, say, ten years. Admission by this method will be confined to those who possess at least a good Second ClassHonours degree, and candidates will be declared successful only if they reach a really high standard.(iii) The introduction of a common general examination for the grades of clerical assistant, shorthand-typist and typist. This will entail some alteration in the grading and -scales of pay of typists and shorthand-typists,to which further consideration will be given in joint discussions.* See footnote to paragraph 36.
SUMMARY  OF  recommendations i. In accordance with Government policy as announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the system of open competitive examinations for entry tothe Civil Service should be resumed as soon as possible after the cessation ofEuropean hostilities. (Paragraphs 3 to 5). There should be &quot; reconstructioncompetitions &quot; which should be primarily for those who have lost oppor-tunities of competing for the Civil Service owing to-the war, and &quot; normalcompetitions &quot; for those who reach the normal ages of entry as recruitmentis reopened.   (Paragraph 8.)Reconstruction Competitions2. The reconstruction competitions should extend over a period, so thatthe last man released from&quot;&apos; the Forces or other war service has as good a chance of competing as the first; and -arrangements should be made to ensurethat late entrants suffer no disadvantage in pay.   (Paragraph 9.)3. For the &quot; accrued vacancies &quot; (that is, vacancies accrued during thewar by wastage and permanent expansion), the main source of recruitsshould be those who have missed their opportunity of competing for the CivilService because of the interruption of the war, i.e. those within &quot; normalage limits plus the period of the war &quot;-.   (Paragraphs ro and 11.)4. A number of the accrued vacancies should, however, &quot;be reserved for those above the &quot; normal age limits plus the period of the war &quot; but not olderthan 30. In the administrative class, there should foe a common field of recruitment up to 30; in the executive, clerical and sub-clerical classes thereshould be reserved for the older group of candidates one vacancy for everyfour allotted to the younger group.   (Paragraph 12.)5. The reconstruction competitions should consist of written examinationsin general subjects, plus interview for the administrative and executive classes.Candidates should be required to have certain minimum educational qualifica-tions, viz. a University degree of at least Second Class Honours standard ora year&apos;s continuous full-time University attendance and expectation of sucha degree, for the administrative class; full-time education up to 17 or HigherSchool Certificate for the executive class; full-time education up to 16 orSchool Certificate for the clerical class; full-time education up to 15 for thesub-clerical class.   (Paragraph 14.)6. Ex-Service men should be guaranteed a generous proportion of vacancies in the reconstruction competitions, viz. clerical one-halif, executive two-thirds,administrative three-quarters (Paragraphs 16 to 24); and ex-Service women should receive a similar guarantee, in their case a proportion of the remainingvacancies corresponding to the proportion of applications received fromqualified candidates in the Women&apos;s Services.   (Paragraph 25.)7. Temporary civil servants should be subject to the same conditions as other candidates, except that:-  &apos;(i) Provision should be made for the retention of specially selectedsenior temporary officers of Principal, or analogous executive or Depart-mental grades, or above, who are- over the age of 30.,. (Paragraphs 32to 34.)     - ;j - * - -       v &apos;     .   *(ii) (a) Provision should also be made for the retention and&apos; establishmentof the best of the temporary officers in junior grades, over the age of 30,who have at least two years&apos; service (including any intervening period ofservice with the Forces, etc.); they should have allotted to them 15 per cent,of the accrued vacancies in the basic executive and clerical grades. (Para-graphs 35 to 38.)
(6) In the clerical -grade this provision should during the reconstructionperiod extend to temporary clerks with service in the Forces, etc., who mayreturn to, or enter, temporary Government service after the cessation ofhostilities in Europe.   (Paragraphs 39 to 41.)   .   ..(iii) A small number of the accrued vacancies in the typing grades shouldbe filled by the establishment of specially suitable individual members ofthe temporary typing staff, over the age of 30.   (Paragraph 43.)(iv) The educational requirements for the clerical and sub-clerical recon-struction competitions should be waived in favour i of juvenile temporarycivil servants who are recommended-(by their Departments. . (Para-graph 44.)8. Established civil servants should be eligible for the reconstruction cotn-petitions (by which they may obtain promotion to a higher class); but as very few of them will be able to comply- with the minimum educationalqualifications for the executive and administrative reconstruction competitions,limited competitions should be provided against fixed quotas of vacancies inthose classes, so as to restore to them -their pre-war opportunities of sittingfor the open competitions.   (Paragraphs 46 to 50.)9. All acting Assistant Principals promoted since the outbreak of war should be required to succeed in the limited competition before their pro-motions are confirmed.   (Paragraph 50.) *10. Limited competitions should be held to restore the lost opportunities of minor and manipulative officers to compete for the clerical class. (Para-graph 51.)Normal Competitions  *11. Normal competitions should be resumed concurrently with reconstruc-tion competitions, and candidates coming forward straight from school orUniversity should be required to sit for a normal competition; (Para-graph 53.)12. Normal competitions should be on the same lines as before the war,subject to:  (i) Introduction of an interview for the executive class.(ii) Introduction, on an experimental basis, of a system of selection ofa limited number of candidates for the administrative class mainly byinterview by the Civil Service Commission.(iii) Introduction of a coirnimon examination for clerical assistants, typistsand shorthand typists.
