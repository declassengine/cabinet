THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. . Copy No.W.P. (44) 577.l$th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.STREET. LIGHTING IN THE LONDON AREA.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.1. At their meeting on the 4th September, 1944 (W.M. (44) 116th Con-clusions), the War Cabinet decided on certain lighting relaxations to beintroduced stage by stage as circumstances permitted. These included the installation of improved street lighting up to 0-2 foot candles for centrallycontrolled street lighting and up to 0 - 02 foot candles for lights which cannot beswitched off on a warning.2. On the 27th September, 1944 (W.M. (44) 128th Conclusions), the WarCabinet discussed whether any further action could be taken to ensure that full advantage was taken of the recent lighting relaxations. It was then explainedthat, although advantage was being taken of the relaxations in the provinces,London had made little change and that the street lighting authorities in Londondid not consider it desirable to adopt the improved standards and that publicopinion would not favour further relaxations at present. The War Cabinet took note of these statements.  -3. It is now necessary to advise the lighting authorities in the London areaof the decision on street lighting and to make a public announcement at thesame time.4. In the London Region there are 97 separate lighting authorities and inthe Administrative County of London (the central area) there are 29. I have discussed the lighting question personally at a conference with members of theCity Corporation, the L.C.C., and all the Metropolitan Boroughs, not only asoperators of street lighting but also as representatives of local public opinion.Their views, which were practically unanimous, may be summarised as follows :&apos; (a) The public in London do not yet desire substantial relaxation of lighting restrictions and would prefer to wait until all possibility of attack had disappeared. This view has been confirmed by the commissioner of Police and the London Regional Commissioner as well as by a sample test (admittedly a small sample) taken by the Ministry ofInformation; and it is illustrated by the considerable percentage of people who have not taken advantage of the relaxation in domesticlighting.(&amp;) The local authorities consider it important that there should beuniformity throughout the London area if higher lighting is installed.This would be most difficult to secure owing to the different types of equipment in use and the large number (97) of separate lightingauthorities concerned.(c) The lighting authorities do not want to instal the intermediate standards of street lighting both on security and on administrative grounds.In most cases it would take some weeks to instal street lighting of the intermediate standard and some weeks again to readapt it to peace-time lighting. Most authorities would prefer to wait until fulllighting could be used and would prefer to go on with their prepara-tions for the time when full peace-time street lighting can be restoredwith safety; and &quot; safety &quot; would mean a Government guarantee ofno further piloted aircraft raids and a declaration that pick-a-backflying-bomb raids could not be aided by street lighting.[28418]y168
5. From this conference and from other enquiries I have made it is clear to me that most of the public and the local authorities in London are not yetprepared for substantial relaxations in the black-out, and that it would be impracticable and undesirable to press them forward too rapidly. It is mostimportant that in London, which has been, and remains, the main target of enemy attack, action by the Government should not run too far in advance of publicopinion.6. In these circumstances it would be-undesirable to press local authoritiesto instal an increased standard of street lighting in the London area, and thereappear, therefore, to be two alternative courses available : (a) To prohibit increased street lighting in London for the time being, or(b) To allow discretion to individual local authorities in the London area toinstal the same standards of street lighting as are allowed else wherein the country.7. The course suggested at (a) above, which i would prefer at present, would meet with the general approval of the majority of local authorities and a large part of the public, but the Cabinet conclusion at the meeting of the 4th September(W.M. (44) 116th Conclusions, Minute 7) was otherwise, and it would probablybe open to criticism in other directions on account of differentiation between london and the rest of the country. Also, if the war continues well into thewinter a dark London for the sixth successive winter is not an attractiveprospect. If security considerations allow, and my colleagues definitely prefer it,the alternative course might be followed and local authorities allowed, at their discretion, to instal the new street lighting, although that will not protect theGovernment from criticism if piloted raids should come. There will, of course,be wide variations in practice between the various boroughs. Some will no doubt have no lighting at all or retain star lighting as at present, while others mayinstal the new lighting, including the still higher standard which has to beextinguished on an alert, in a few cases where there is central control. The resultswill be patchy and that is undesirable. In many towns outside London, however,the new lighting has been installed in some of the streets only, and reports fromthose towns do not suggest that the contrast between the lighted streets and thedark ones is excessively dangerous.8. One of the main considerations in this matter is still the security aspect,i.e., whether enemy attack on this country and on London in particular is likelyand whether relaxation of street lighting in London would spur the enemy tosuch an attack. On this aspect, the Chiefs of Staff will no doubt be in a positionto advise the War Cabinet when they are considering this matter.H.
