to DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET.Copy No.\W.P. (44) 565.mh October, 1944.WAR CABINET.PUBLICATION OF A REPORT BY A UNITED STATES MISSION.1. I am being pressed from both sides of the House to publish, or make available to Members, the Report of a recent United States Mission to the Britishcoalfields.2. The decision that this Mission, composed of technical experts, should visit this country was taken by the Coal Sub-Committees in Washington and london of the Combined Production and Resources Board. Its principal objectswere to study, and report on, the use of United States machinery sent to thiscountry for employment both at opencast sites and underground.3. The Mission was given a free hand during its three weeks&apos; stay duringlast June and July. Its members visited many pits and talked with many colliery owners and miners. The programme was arranged through the agency of myMinistry, but for the most part the members of the Mission were unaccompaniedby officials. The discussions with which it had been proposed to conclude the tourwere curtailed by the reluctance of members of the Mission to visit London inthe circumstances then prevailing.4. The recommendations contained in the Mission&apos;s final Report, a numberof which are of real value, have been carefully considered by the Ministry ofWorks and the Ministry of Fuel and Power. In the main there was littledisagreement, though in transmitting our views to Washington we have refrained from commenting on essentially domestic matters.- 5. It was agreed by all concerned that, as the Report was a secret one to theC.P.R.B., it, like others, should not be made available to the public or to Parlia-ment. I informed the House of this decision on the 3rd August. In September,however, after some leakage in the United States of the contents of the Report,which was soon distorted, an official summary, drafted entirely in Washington,was released to the Press on both sides of the Atlantic. This summary avoided allcontentious points.6. The summary has not satisfied Parliament and I am now being pressedhard from both sides of the House to make the complete Report available. this raises the question of principle of publication of Reports to the C.P.R.B. (a pointon which the Americans must be consulted) and also the question of expediency of publication in this country. Neither the Minister of Works nor myself wouldhave any objection to the publication of the Report, as a whole, but there are two possible objections on which I feel I must consult my colleagues (a) the aggravation of differences of opinion, already all too prevalentbetween the coalowners and the mine-workers in this country;(b) the possible effect on Anglo-American relations of the outspoken comments on American interference in our domestic affairs which might beexpected to follow publication.I append a number of excerpts from the Report which will illustrate these points.7. In face of the obvious desire of the House that the Report should bepublished I feel that more harm than good would come from a refusal.   With[28367]Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.
regard to objection (a) I think the time has come when it will do no harm to either side of the industry to read a few criticisms from an outside source on theirundoubted deficiencies. As regards the objections in (b) and the question ofprinciple involved in publishing a secret Report to the C.P.R.B., I must leave thedecision to my colleagues. My own recommendation, after taking into accountall the circumstances, is that, if the Americans agree, the Report should bepublished.G. Ll. G.Minstry of Fuel and Potver,7, Millbank, S.W. 1,10th October, 1944.Annex.EXCERPTS FROM THE UNITED STATES MISSIONS REPORT.1. Although we are fully aware of the difficult social and political problems in the British mining industry, we are compelled to point out that the center- ofthe problem of increased production is the bad feeling and antagonism whichpervades the industry and which manifests itself in low morale, non-cooperationand indifference. In almost every district we visited miners&apos; leaders and mineowners complained of men leaving the mines early, failure to clear the face and voluntary absenteeism. We were also struck by the antagonism of the owners to the Ministry of Fuel and Power. In this connection we cannot help but record that some mine owners, miners&apos; leaders, and mine workers do not seem fully to appreciate the critical coal situation of the United Nations.- &apos;H* -Jf -^r -K-Morale.2. We have the opinion that in spite of continued appeals and propagandaefforts, many coalowners and the majority of miners do not fully realise themilitary necessity for increased production of coal. There appears to be atendency for management to discount the urgency of war requirements and ofthe individual miners to discount information passed on to them by management and their own leaders. Certainly if the urgency were known and not discounted,an improvement could be expected.******3.   We are surprised at the length of the work week in British mines.....Only a small extra effort on the part of British miners an additional half-tona day per man at the coal face or, put in another way, 30 tons per man overall per year would yield another 20 to 24 million tons per year. We cannot believethat British miners are physically incapable of this effort.
