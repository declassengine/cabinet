We shall,  of course,  contend for the White Paper&quot;policy,  and in particular for an International convention which will determine frequencies of services,  allocation ofnational quotas, and rates for passengers, mail and carried on all international air routes.freight3. We know that the United States will oppose this strongly,though we shall have the support of all the Dominions andprobably of a n/imber of European countries.      It is quite possible that the United States will, propose a compromise,which would give them a flying start&apos; on many routes, and wouldprovide for an automatic distribution of frequencies in pro-portion to the numbers of passengers carried in the initial stages.      This would obviously operate enormously in favour ofthe United States, as they will be in a position to operateaircraft and secure the bulk ofany such compromisewe should refusetheandan unlimited number oftraffic.      I thinkinsist that the distribution of frequencies should be in proportion to the passengers and freight embarked from each country.h. Assuming that the United States refuse a satisfactoryfrequencies convention, there are alternative courses ofaction open to us:(a) We could try to establish a Convention excluding theUnited States and embracing all countries, British andforeign, who would be willing to join it.to this, as it would be lining up a numberagainstwhat we the United States; and I think we need in a &quot;better way.I am opposedof countries can secure(b) If the United States refuse a convention, we are driven back on bi-lateral agreements, which is what the UnitedStates want.      Here two possibilities are open to us:we and the Dominions can either act independently;    orwe can try to agree with the Dominions that the empire should act top-ether.5. I suggest that combined Empire action is not open to theobjections of a &quot;line-up&quot; convention and would be greatly tothe advantage of all Empire countries.      Bi-lateral negotiationsover services and landing rights will afford the one opportunityof securing the reciprocal facilities which we and the Dominionswant from the United Statsfacilities on United StatesCmd.    6561

airfields in the Pacific      Certainly we and Australia andNew Zealand would &quot;be in a stronger position to secure these&apos;if we act together.6. In this connection there is the precedent of theagreement we made with the Dominions in May, 1937.      Wethen agreed that if any country approached the UnitedKingdom or a Dominion for civil air facilities;, we would consult together,  in order to see whether there was anything..hich one or other of us was trying to/get from theapplicant country, so as to &quot;bring this into the settlement.It is fair to add that McKenzie King accepted this with agood deal of hesitation, and with no commitment thathe would take action.7. I do not know what the present attitude of theDominions would be, except that when I was in SouthAfrica, Sturrock, the Minister of Transport, himself .suggested action on these lines. I should imagine that australia and New Zealand would also support; I should&quot;be mere doubtful of Canada. But I ask for authority t*make such an arrangement with the Dominions and India ifthey are willing.8. As regards the terms of any bi-lateral agreement which this country might make with the United States orany other country,  I should make it plain that the UnitedKingdom would make it a condition of any agreement thatfrequencies of services,  allocation of quotas and fixing of rates would &quot;be provided for.9. I should refuse to make any bi-lateral agreement&quot;while I was in -America.      I think. I can reasonably refuseto do this on the following grounds:(a) In the absence of a general convention,conditions of frequencies, etc.  will require careful working out, which can only be donein London and W shington,,in consultation withail interests and with all the information available.(b) The United Kingdom and JSurope are still heavilyengaged in the war and even a provisional agreement could only be made in consultation withthe Fighting Services.      In this I should add that SKAEF had insisted that for the time beingall air operations in Europe shall he on a service basis;    and that the Combined Chiefs ofStaff are considering proposals to keep aviation in Europe on a military &quot;basis for a considerable period alter the end of hostilities.-(c) Any agreement of this importance, setting acourse for the future, would require theapproval of the Cabinet.(d) Existing arrangements are working well,  andare constantly and satisfactorily adjusted to-meet all war-time requirements.S.3Ariel House2hth October,  19&apos;!
