fHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Copy No, f)W.P. (44) 587.23rd October, 1944.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1944 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.MUCH gratification was expressed throughout Canada at the selection ofQuebec as the site of the recent Conference, and a warm welcome was extended tothe Prime Minister and President Roosevelt. The statement by Mr. Churchill onBritain&apos;s intentions in the Pacific was extremely well received, and press com-ments indicate a growing awareness of Canada&apos;s position as a Pacific nation. Inthis connexion, there was much enthusiastic press comment on Canada&apos;s approach-ing part in grappling with the &quot; barbarians of the Pacific.&quot; The Winnipeg FreePress said that the Canadian Prime Minister &quot; had committed Canada irre-trievably to playing an adult role in the conclave of nations which would rid theworld of war and warmongers.&quot;2. The liberation of France and Belgium was hailed by French and English-speaking Canadians alike with relief tinged with emotion. The rapid advance ofthe Allied troops in Europe has brought closer the question of a Federal Electionthroughout Canada. The Federal Cabinet has been in almost constant session,and new Cabinet appointments, post-war plans and preparations for the electionhave been under review. The governing factor in the election date is the end ofhostilities in Europe; from that date it is estimated that it would take sixty days in which to set the electoral machinery in motion.3. Controversy continues to rage over the statement by Major&apos; Smythe, areturned officer of the Canadian Army, that the reinforcements now being pro-vided for that Army are green, inexperienced and only partly trained. Althoughthe Ministry of National Defence has denied that this is the case, it has notallayed the general belief that there is much in Major Smythe&apos;s allegations, whichare said to have the support of the Premier of Ontario.4. The newly elected Premier of Saskatchewan (the Reverend T. C.Douglas, C.C.F.) has proclaimed a policy of extensive public ownership, eitherthrough municipalities or co-operative organisations. Announcing his pro-gramme, he said that the Governments immediate plans were to acquire and develop all possible natural resources available and to take over those enterpriseswhich are monopolies, and to give full assistance to co-operative movements todevelop new industries. The new Premier&apos;s plan, however, does not entirely rule out private ownership, the latter assurance being generally regarded as intendedto attract the votes of the farming community.5. The Canadian Minister of Labour announced a campaign to secure100,000 workers from Canadian farms for essential work; 60,000 for forestry and40,000 for other industries. The labour supply necessary to maintain butter and cheese production and to care for live-stock is not to be tapped.6.   On its return to Belgium the Canadian Legation at Brussels will be raised to the status of an Embassy; in the meanwhile, M. Pierre Dupuy, will act as.[28452] &apos; g

Frigate St. John sank a U-boat off Lands End on the 1st withthe remainder of the 9th Escort Group. On the 23rd H.M.C. Destroyer Iroquoissent a party ashore at Les Sables d&apos;01onne and obtained from the F.F.I. detailsof the defences of La Rochelle and La Pallice.France.8. During the advance of the 21st Army Group from the Seine to the Sommeand beyond, the position of the 1st Canadian Army was on the left of the line.At the end of August they had just completed mopping up the Germans hemmedin within the loops of the Seine.9. After the crossing of the river, Rouen was rapidly captured by the canadians on the 31st August, after which some troops of the Canadian Armypushed forward towards the Somme while others were diverted towards Dieppe.St. Valery and Le Havre. On the 1st the 2nd Canadian Division re-enteredDieppe, the scene of their attack two years previously. By the 2nd, canadian troops had gained full possession of the Havre peninsula except for Le Havreitself, while some of their armour had crossed the Somme at Abbeville.Continuing their advance along the coast, the Canadians were on the general lineCalais-St. Omer-Aire on the 5th. although Boulogne, like Le Havre, was still holding out. By the 12th the Canadians occupied Bruges and having crossed the Ghent canal between Ghent and Bruges in the face of strong oppositionreached the Leopold canal near the Dutch border 10 miles east of Bruges onthe same day. All German opposition south of the line Ghent-Bruges had nowbeen overcome with the exception of the three ports Boulogne, Calais andDunkirk, whose garrisons still held out.. Le Havre fell on the 12th after a36-hour assault.10. The third week of the month saw no further marked advance althoughCanadian and Polish troops continued pressing back the enemy against theestuary of the Scheldt. Meanwhile other Canadian forces were attackingBoulogne and Dunkirk, and by the 17th were fighting in the outskirts of theformer town. All resistance ceased in Boulogne on the 22nd and about ,000 prisoners were taken.11. On the 25th United Kingdom and Canadian troops captured Turnhoutand secured a bridgehead across the Turnhout-Antwerp canal which theymanaged to maintain against heavy German counter-attacks. Meanwhile, furtherwest, in co-operation with the Poles, other Canadians were pressing the enemystill further back against the southern bank of the Scheldt estuary, while othersstarted an all-out attack on Calais on the 25th which resulted in the capture ofthe citadel on the 28th with a considerable number of prisoners and of the townon the night the 30th September/1st October./ taly.12. During September the Eighth Army attacked the Gothic Line which involved it in fighting as stiff as any which they had ever experienced. the canadians took full share in this fighting, being located on the extreme right flank of the Army.13. On the last day of August Canadian forces in the Adriatic sector brokeinto the Gothic Line near Montereggio. By the 4th September they had capturedCattolica on the coast but here ran up against very stiff resistance along thestrongly held positions from Abissinia to Coriano; German opposition inCoriano was particularly stubborn necessitating the use of both United Kingdomand Canadian armour against the town which was finally surrounded as theresult of a night attack on the 12th/13th which secured for us the Coriano-SanSavino ridge. This enabled United Kingdom and Canadian troops to pushforward quickly and gain bridgeheads over the river Marano. It was thennecessary to secure the high ground to the north and north-west of the river and,in particular, the important and dominating feature of Fortunate. Meanwhileon the coastal road south-east of Rimini Canadian troops which had entered the village of San Martino were heavily counter-attacked and. driven from the villageon the 17th.   The Fortunate feature was finally cleared of enemy on the 21st,
and on the same day the Canadians captured Rimini and established a bridge-head over the Marecchia. At this stage the 2nd New Zealand Division took overin the coastal sector and continued the advance up the road north-west of Rimini;14. Forty-two R.C.A.F. Squadrons are at present operational overseas.,Twenty-three are located in the United Kingdom, seventeen in France, one in italy and one in Ceylon.15. Heavy bombers of No. 6 (R.C.A.F.) Bomber Group flew 2,873 sortiestotalling 11,717 hours during September. Losses were the lowest for any monththis year with only six aircraft missing. Targets were mainly German defences and pockets of resistance in the Pas de Calais at Cap Gris Nez, Boulogne andthe Low Countries;  cities in Germany were also attacked.16. Beaufighters, Wellingtons and Sunderlands of R.C.A.F. coastal command flew 428 sorties totalling 3,487 operational hours. One Sunderland,.one Wellington and one Beaufighter are missing from these operations. an escort Vessel was sunk and two more damaged; three merchant vessels were damaged and two more set on fire; a 5,000-ton passenger vessel was also set on fire; one auxiliary vessel was hit by rockets and seen to blow up and during thecourse of a further attack two coasters were hit and later beached. &apos;17. R.C.A.F. Squadrons in the 2nd Tactical Air Force, of which there areseventeen, flew 4,984 sorties totalling 7,429 hours. . Twenty-one aircraft, are missing from these operations. The figures for sorties and hours flown show a1considerable reduction on those for August, which is mainly due to manySquadron moves during the first two weeks of the month while our ground forces-were moving rapidly through France and Belgium. These Squadrons of the:Tactical Air Force claim to have destroyed 89 German aircraft.18. The Spitfire Squadron and two Mosquito Night Squadrons of the Air;defence of Great Britain flew 333 sorties totalling 849 operational hours. OneMosquito of 418 Squadron is missing. This Squadron claims to have destroyed&apos;fourteen German aircraft.19. During the month No. 437 (R.C.A.F.) Squadron was formed in transport Command under No. 46 Group, The Squadron flew 134 sorties totalling(y$l operational hours, being engaged in glider towing, parachute dropping and supply carrying during the airborne operation at Arnhem. Five aircraft are missing from operations.20. The R.C.A.F. Fighter Squadron in Italy lost two aircraft during thefirst half of the month.21. The R.C.A.F. Catalina Squadron in Ceylon flew 665 operational hourswithout any particular incident; all aircraft returned safely from operations.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.22. The final figures for the Referendum on the question of increasedconstitutional powers for the Commonwealth Government (to which reference hasbeen made in previous reports) have been announced.   The totals were : *Against increased powers for increased powersTotals.2,305,4181,963,400Civilians.2,110,2701,744,943Services.195.148218,45223. A conference to discuss the establishment of a nation-wide politicalmovement &quot;with a liberal policy and approach, and an effective organisation,&quot;was arranged by the Opposition leader, Mr. R. G. Menzies, to be held in October.Mr. Menzies said that the Referendum campaign showed clearly that a greatbody of public opinion was liberal and progressive, but distrusted and resistedexcessive Government control or interference in production and in the businessof the citizen.24. At the opening session of the Commonwealth Parliament in september the Prime Minister made a statement on the reassessment of man-power following upon his discussions during his visit overseas to the Prime Minister&apos;s Conference.;Mr. Curtin said that directions had been given for the release of 30,000 menfrom the Army and 15,000 from the R.A.A.F. by June 1945. Of these, 20,000were to be released by the 31st December, 1944. This step has been madenecessary by the grave shortage of man-power in the food-producing and[28452] b 2
processing industries, and there was a fear that Australia would not be able tomeet either her commitments with Great Britain, or any future demands, as aresult of developments in the Pacific War. In the subsequent budget debate the-Prime Minister agreed to consider a secret session to discuss the Army and munitions production.25. The Prime Minister announced on the 17th September that theCommonwealth Government would welcome any proposals by British interests to establish industries in Australia. A subsequent announcement made knownthe Governments decision to adopt the recommendations of a Cabinet sub-committee. which has been enquiring into the manufacture of motor cars. AHinterested parties will be requested to submit proposals, and, should satisfactoryproposals not be received, the Government will set up a corporation to manufac-ture a complete car. Some alarm has been expressed at the Governments stepto set up industry solely to fill gaps in civil needs.26. Outlining in the House of Representatives the measures that are beingtaken to prepare for the expansion of civil aviation throughout Australia,Mr. Drakeford, Minister for Air, said that this development could not be deferred until the end of the war, and that existing airfields were already being brought up to date.27. Dr. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, in introducing into parliament the Relief and Rehabilitation Bill, the purpose of which is to enableAustralia to discharge her obligations as a member of U.N.R.R.A., said that australia^ total contribution would He approximately  12,000,000, of which thegreater part would be applied to the procurement of Australian supplies.28. A statement by Dr. Evatt, during the parliamentary debate on external affairs, has been welcomed as emphasising that Australia&apos;s vulnerable position must be recognised in any post-war settlement. Dr. Evatt also expressed the hopethat Australia would continue to have greater representation abroad.29. The coal situation has continued to occupy the principal place in domestic affairs. The Opposition leader, Mr. Menzies, moved in the House ofRepresentatives a vote of censure on the Government for its failure to maintainadequate supplies of coal. In reply, the Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin, outlinedsteps which had been taken to develop new mines, to increase production and the life of the old mines. He said he had tried appeasement, legislation and themailed fist in dealing with miners.   Henceforth the law would be enforced: ruthlessly against offenders, whether workers or management.   The GovernmentI majority was so great that the motion was defeated.30. Mr. Curtin announced in the House of Representatives that theappointment of Mr. S. M. Bruce as High Commissioner for Australia in london had been extended for another year from October.NEW ZEALAND.31. The Prime Minister&apos;s statement on the future employment of theNew Zealand Army has evoked the hope that the Quebec decisions will not have resulted in the New Zealand Army being excluded from the forthcomingoperations in the Pacific.32. A debate in Parliament on the estimates for the Department of external affairs provoked comments about some of the persons who had been selected for posts overseas. The desirability of New Zealand being adequately repre-sented overseas is fully appreciated, but the point of the criticisms was thatthere were not enough trained men available for diplomatic posts, and that enquiries should be made into the steps taken by the Government to recruit andtrain suitable staff for the Department generally.33. In reply to a request by a deputation of the United Kingdom Manu-facturers and New Zealand Representatives&apos; Association for a government statement of policy about New Zealand imports, Mr. Nash told them that theUnited Kingdom Government must first be consulted.34. The position of the New Zealand Victory Loan is not very satisfactory,subscriptions so far amounting only to  18 million, thus leaving more than halfthe target figure of  40 millions to be subscribed within the remaining ten days.
Service Activities.35. 500 officers and ratings of the Royal New Zealand Navy arrived inEngland on loan to the Royal Navy. ;36.   H.M.N.Z.S. Arabia arrived at Auckland from the United Kingdom.;80th and 81st Motor Launch Flotillas operated in the Solomon Islands area under the orders of the Commander, South Pacific Area..37. The 2nd New Zealand Division took over from the 1st canadian division in the Adriatic coastal sector of the Eighth Army at 6 a.m. ,on the21st September. On the 22nd, they advanced four miles north of Rimini along,the Ravenna road against stiffening German resistance; little further progress,Was made before the end of the month, partly owing to a break in the weatheraccompanied by heavy rain.38.   The 3rd Division returned to New Zealand from South Pacific Area.;39.   285th and 286th R.N.Z.A.F. Fighter Squadrons operated with allied expeditionary Air Force in the forward area on the Continent of Europe.40. Arrangements were made for the allocation of R.N.Z.A.F. squadrons in the Pacific as follows : New Zealand- &apos;2 Fighter.1 Bomber-reconnaissance.2 Transport.South Pacific Area 4 Fighter.2 Bomber-reconnaissance.2 Flying-boat.South-west Pacific Area 4 Fighter.2 Bomber-reconnaissance.Squadrons in South Pacific will be more or less static but those in South-1west Pacific will be established on a mobile basis.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.41. A Provincial By-Election held at Germiston, on the Rand, regardedas a useful test of public opinion, resulted in the United Party retaining the seat by a majority of 1,696 in a poll of 5,000. The result is specially satisfactory to the Government as the Nationalists had made the meat scheme a major issue,:and claimed that the Rand had been badly affected by lack of supplies.42. Mr. Pirow, leader of the New Order group, is active in his efforts to try to secure unity between the Opposition groups outside the Nationalist party on a basis of National-Socialist doctrine. He addressed an open letter to dr. Malan, leader of the Nationalist Party, and to Dr. Van Rensburg,Commandant-General of &quot; Ossewa Brandwag,&quot; appealing, in the interests ofAfrikaner unity, for the establishment of a Committee of Conciliation whichwould act for the whole of Afrikaner-speaking sections in such matters aslanguage and colour questions, and the setting up of an anti-Communist front.This move follows a demand made at a recent Nationalist Party Congress atPretoria, that members of the Party should resign from &quot; Ossewa Brandwag.&quot;43. The United Party are giving great publicity to Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s visit to South African units in Italy and North Africa. One consequence has beenthe speculation that has been aroused about the possibility of Field-Marshal Smutsrelinquishing the Premiership in Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s favour soon after the end ofthe war, and Nationalist newspapers now tend to transfer their personal attacksfrom the Prime Minister to Mr. Hofmeyr.44. A lightning strike took place on the Rand of native workers in thenour-milling industry. The effectiveness of the organisation behind the strikehas given rise to a probably justified belief that the strike was instigated bythe Communist Party. Nationalist newspapers seized the opportunity of attacking the Government for their alleged complaisant attitude towardsCommunists.
45. The mine wages dispute has entered a more hopeful phase as a resultof the Governments decision to displace the proposed Arbitration commission by a Board of Conciliation on which both parties will be represented. Representa-tives of the mineworkers, and of the Chamber of Mines, have agreed to theChairman&apos;s proposal of an informal meeting with a view to settling the dispute.46. The opposition in Natal to a draft ordinance controlling the occupationof property by Indians continues to increase. The Dominion and Labour parties,with a view to the October elections, are competing with each other in attacks on the proposed measure, but both demand a complete separation between theraces.47. There is evidence of an improvement in the food situation in the union and the Government food control schemes are now being enforced with greatereffectiveness.48. In a statement issued by the National Housing Commission, a Stateplan for housing which gives hope of a substantial improvement in the housingposition in South Africa 1945, is announced. The Financial Agreement betweenthe Commission and local authorities, together wuth an  8 million grant bythe Government, means that little financial difficulty should be experienced incarrying out the plan of building 12,000 houses in the next twelve months.49. The Governments old-age pension scheme for Natives5 which will bebrought into operation in stages, is first to be applied to Natives living in cities.In January next, the scheme will be extended to Natives in towns, and in April1945, to- those in rural areas. Although the scale of pensions ( 1 per month isthe maximum) is low, it is a beginning, and as such, warmly welcomed by those interested in Native welfare in South Africa.EIRE.50.   The Dail reassembled on the 19th September.51. Questioned as to what steps have been taken by the Eire Governmentto formulate schemes of economic and social importance which could be broughtinto operation immediately after the present emergency, Mr. de Valera saidthat the Cabinet Committee, which had been set up in November 1942 to direct the post-war planning activities of all Departments, has considered and approved in principle a large number of schemes relating to such matters as agriculture,land division, afforestation, fisheries, housing and other constructional workings,transport and communications and general industrial development. He addedthat the Committee, with wide terms of reference, was engaged in the considera-tion of post-war policy in regard to agriculture and had already submitted anumber of interim reports. Mr. de Valera at the same time issued a warning that most of the plans which are being prepared now can only be given effectto gradually as the supply position improves.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.52. The major political event, in September was the opening on the 9th,and the breakdown on the 27th, of a series of conversations between Mr. gandhi and Mr. Jinnah held for the purpose of discussing the proposals for a communalsettlement which had been put forward in Mr. Gandhi&apos;s name earlier in theyear. The talks broke down over the issue of Pakistan the claim for thecomplete independence of the Moslem provinces as a separate &quot;nation.&quot;Statements were made by both leaders which contemplated the possibility thattheir efforts would be renewed at some future date. The breakdown was notunexpected : the general disappointment at the failure to reach agreement was accompanied in certain Hindu quarters by expressions of relief and satisfaction that Mr. Gandhi had not entirely compromised the ideal of a united India.It seems unlikely that for the time being any further attempt will be made bythe Moslems and Hindus to reconcile their political differences.
Economic,53. Transportation. Further strong representations have been made byfche British Missions in Washington to General Somervell that he should accept80 per cent, of Indians remaining requirements of 218 Broad-Gauge locomotives and 16,000 Broad-Gauge Wagons on the Army Supply Programme for deliveryas early as possible in 1945 in accordance with the agreement reached between general Covell and the Commander-in-Chief, India. General Somervell has,however, supported the earlier decision of the United States War Department,and has firmly refused to do anything towards providing any part of these require-jneiits through the Army Supply Programme. It was anticipated that GeneralSomervell might support the attitude of the United States War department and the British Mission was accordingly authorised,,,tn that event, to suggest to the Americans that the United Kingdom should produce 100 locomotivesfor India in 1945 with a corresponding increase in the demands on the UnitedStates for locomotives for relief purposes in Europe. There is good reason to hope that the acceptance of this suggestion will be confirmed very shortly. Asregards the provision of the balance of 118 locomotives and 16,000 wagons, theP.A.O. Committee has requested the British Military Authorities in washington to. make final representations to the Americans in the light of &apos;&apos; Octagon &apos;&apos;decisions, and the outcome is now awaited.54. Coal. Indian coal production from underground mines continues to decline and even though there has been some expansion of open cast production,total raisings in 1944 are unlikely to be better than those of 1943 when23 million tons were despatched. Meanwhile, requirements continue to expandand pithead stocks are now negligible. A substantial amount of open castequipment has, however, been procured in the United States and is being shippedto India. It will be in full, operation by September 1945 and should increaseopen cast production from about 2 million to about 6 million tons in a full year.55. Civil Aviation. Discussions took place at Washington between the15th and 22nd August between the United States authorities and an indian delegation consisting of Sir G. Bajpai, Sir G. Bewoor and Sir F. Tymms,regarding the post-war organisation of international air transport. Thediscussions resulted in the most definite statement of the American positionhitherto obtained. The Indian Delegation pressed on the Americans without success the necessity of an international authority in civil air transport matters with executive powers. The Government of India are sending delegations to theCommonwealth Air Conference at Ottawa on the 23rd October and to theInternational Conference called by the United States Government at Washington on the 1st November.56. Meanwhile the Government of India are laying plans for their internal air services. These plans provide for a network with a route mileage of10,500 miles, and the Government of India are considering what types of aircraft can best be used on these routes. There have also been discussions with theB.O.A.C. regarding the training.of Indians by the latter.India and the War.Military.57. Italy. Indian formations have taken part in the fighting on both the fifth and Eighth Armies fronts throughout the month. They were seen by theSecretary of State for India during his tour in Italy. High tribute was paid onthis occasion to the fighting qualities of the Indian division under his commandby the Fifth Army Commander, General Mark Clark.58. Burma. In the Chin Hills the 5th Indian Division successfully crossed the Manipur River and continued its advance down the Tiddim Road to within10 miles of Tiddim. This is 150 road miles south of. Imphal. Japaneseresistance to the crossing of the Manipur River was not severe. The West bankQf the Chindwin North of Sittaung was cleared of the enemy, and 14th Armytroops crossed to the East bank.59. In the railway corridor in the North Burma the 36th Division capturedttopin and pushed on to the South-West. Sixty miles of the railway have been cleared of the enemy. Allied patrols from Myitkyina returned there after makingcontact with Chinese troops west of the Sal ween on the Yunan border. Generalu u I-^do road communications have been made entirely secure by the4th Army, except against the weather.
60. In the Arakan the monsoon pause was broken, and the capture of a ridgesix miles South-West of Buthidaung by Indian troops greatly strengthened ourcommand of the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road.Air. i .61. Strategic bombing was a feature of the month. The new Bangkok-Moulmein railway was twice heavily bombed inside Siam. Rail targets in southern Burma, the Mandalay-Lashio railway and objectives on the burma road were repeatedly and heavily attacked at special points. A series of attacks by Beaufighters using rocket projectiles was carried out against enemy shippingoff the Tenasserim coast with good results. Effective air support was giventhroughout the month to all advances in the 14th Army area and along theMyitkyina-Mandalay railway. Considerable damage was inflicted on theretreating Japanese.62.   The enemy made no showing in the air.General.63. The Phillips Report. The political and press controversy in Britainand American on this subject caused little interest among the fighting forces,American, British and Indian, and their relationships appeared quite unafftcted by it. It was realised that the present successful phase of land operationscompletely disproved the criticisms of the Indian Army.64. Morale. This remained high. Many B.O.Rs. now pin their hopes of repatriation on the end of the war against Germany, when they confidently expecta big reduction in the qualifying period.65. Bombay Port Reconstruction. ^Clearance of wreckage from the bottom of Victoria Dock was 30 per cent, completed. It is anticipated that Victoria Dockwill be re-watered by the end of October and that both docks, excepting two berthsin Victoria, will be ready for use by the 1st November.66. Animal Casualties. From the 1st January to the 31st July, 1944, therewere 10,934 casualties in the 14th Army. This represented a monthly wastage rateof 6 - 3 per cent, horses and 5 - 7 per cent, mules. 3,882 were a dead loss throughbattle casualties, injuries, disease, &amp;c. .67. Postal-The Government of India agreed to the introduction of a duty-free parcel service from troops overseas to their relatives in India on similar lines to the concession to British troops overseas to their relatives in the UnitedKingdom.68. Coastwise Navigation Lights. On the representation of theCommander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet, that the continued black-out of coastwisenavigation lights represented a danger to shipping, it was decided that all lightson the West coast and certain more important lights on the East coast shouldbe exhibited at full brilliancy.External Relations.69. A afghanistan. The Afghan Government announced on the 7thSeptember that they no longer recognised Vichy France.70. The Government of India have informed the Afghan Government thatthey will welcome the visit to India of an Afghan Military Mission. The Missionwill consist of six senior Afghan officers, and they will be accompanied by theBritish Military Attache from Kabul Legation. S.E.A.C. have informed theGovernment of India that they see no objection in principle to the Mission being allowed to visit the forward areas.71. The economic situation during the month was steady. Crops were good and the seasonal export of dried fruits to India had begun.72. North-West Frontier. There was nothing of importance to report onthe Frontier, which remained quiet. The Fakir of Ipi remained in seclusionduring Ramzan, probably at Gorwekht. Some concern was still reported amongthe Mahsuds over the question of grain supplies.  .73. Tibet.-Sir Basil Gould, Political Officer in Sikkim, arrived in Lhasaon the 31st August and had a good reception. He has already reported on hisopening conversations with the Tibetan Government and with Mr. Shen, theChinese Delegate.
74.   Mr. Steele, a reputable American journalist from India, was givenfacilities to pay a short visit to Lhasa early in the month.75. Sinkiang. General Sheng, the Tupan or Military Governor, who hasbeen in office since 1933, has been removed and appointed Minister of agriculture in Chungking. This is a mark of the way General Chiang Kai-shek hasstrengthened his hold on the Province.76. Nepal. The Government of India are informing His&apos; Highness the maharaja of Nepal that they would see no objection to a visit to India incognitoby the King of Nepal and the Heir Apparent. They are suggesting, however, thatthe party should be accompanied by the Pirst Secretary to the British Legation,Katmandu, and that Calcutta and Puri should be omitted from the tour onaccount of congestion and uncomfortable conditions there.77. Persian Gulf.- An American Consul has been appointed to Dhahran(the oil centre in Eastern Saudi-Arabia opposite Bahrein Island). He will payvisits to Bahrein to provide consular facilities for Americans there. On beinginformed by the British Political Agent of the appointment, the Sheikh ofBahrein expressed considerable alarm and asked for an assurance (which wasgiven) that the American Consul ha&apos;d no official status in Bahrein.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occupied Burma.78.   No fresh developments of importance were reported during September.79. The main theme of the propaganda of the Puppet Government wasthe misfortunes which would fall upon the Burmese in the event of the Britishwinning the war. The Director of Propaganda issued orders that 17 points ofa speech by Ba Maw on this subject were to be driven home by all officials under his charge so that every Burmese would learn them off by heart.80. The creation of a new political body, the Greater Burma Association,appears to indicate further efforts on the part of the Puppet Government toregiment the people on the usual Totalitarian lines.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Acquisition of, surplus material from United States Bases in the West Indies.81. As a result of the intervention of the British members of the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission, the United States Authorities have now agreedthat British Colonial Governments in&apos; the Caribbean should have first priority in the right to purchase for cash, for fair market value, any United StatesGovernment surplus equipment located in British territories in the Caribbean.Previously United States local commanders, acting under regulations, were unwilling to hold surplus material to enable the Colonial Governments to havethe first refusal before disposing of it locally or shipping it elsewhere.82. The main object of the arrangement is to give West Indian Govern-ments the opportunity of acquiring scarce building materials, &amp;c, needed forschemes under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act. In. advising theGovernments concerned of the new American decision, I have made it clearthat the exchange position will not permit of the acquisition of any materialexcept for purposes which would otherwise have justified early importation ofthe material concerned from outside.Jamaica Bananas.83. As a result of a hurricane in August 1944 a considerable portion of thebanana plantations suffered damage and destruction.   The Governor has recently- [28452] -        c
been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government will, subject to Parliament votingthe funds required, provide financial assistance to the growers. This will takethe form of grants and loans for resuscitation and replanting and for newplantings, and of an extension of the guaranteed purchase scheme, on lines recommended-mended by the majority of a representative committee set up locally. Briefdetails of the assistance to be granted are as follows : (a) Guaranteed purchase of fruit. Period of operation to be extended fromthe 30th June, 1945, to 31st December, 1946. During this period His Majesty&apos;sGovernment undertakes to finance the purchase of fruit of high grade exportablequality up to a maximum of 24 million stems of bananas spread aver the wholeof the extended period subject, however, to adjustment in the light of actualcircumstances. Receipts from sales of bananas during this period will be whollyat the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government,(b) Guaranteed price of fruit. Present price of 3s. 6d. per count bunch plus3d. per count bunch for leaf spot control measures increased to 45. Qd. and 4d. percount bunch respectively, with the objects of providing additional encouragement to growers to resuscitate or replant their plantations and of covering recent wage increases,(c) Grants and Loans for Resuscitation and Replanting and for NewPlantings. Assistance calculated with reference to the percentage of damage to plantations will be available to growers from a free grant and an interestfree loan from United Kingdom funds which it is proposed in due course to ask parliament to vote to the Jamaica Government. The period of the loans will befor a term of three years (with extension at the discretion of the AgriculturalLoan Society Board), repayable after fifteen months, with interest at the rateof 2^ per cent, per annum.Defence.84. The 81st West African Division serving in Burma is standing up well to the hardships of jungle fighting and its sickness rate has been much lower thanthat of British and Indian troops in the same theatre.85. The Somaliland Camel Corps is being disbanded. I have agreed withthe recommendations of the G.O.C.-in-C., East Africa, and the Army Council,that no other alternative was open in view of the conduct of the Corps last June(see August report, paragraph 102).86. The personnel of the First Battalion Mauritius Regiment are beingabsorbed into Artisan Works Companies and similar units.&apos; 87. With effect from the 1st August, 1944, increased family allowances havebeen paid to all Colonial Forces where the local Governors and ServiceCommanders have recommended that this is desirable. The increases are basedon the new rates of family allowance recently applied to United Kingdom Forces.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.88. Both the Jewish and Arab communities are principally concerned withthe future of Palestine. There is widespread publicity to the elect that the arrival of Lord Gort will presage new and rapid developments in policy, withpartition prominent amongst the solutions rumoured. Each community viewsthe activities of the other with intensified jealousy. Both display typicalintransigence when the death of Mustafa Khaldi revived the old controversyover the Jerusalem Mayoralty. Jews and Arabs are equally uncompromising indemanding that the new Mayor should be a Jew or a Moslem Arab respectively.In general, Palestine Arabs look to Arab unity as their main hope of fendingoff Zionist domination. Conversely, Jewish opinion is apprehensive of the possible effect on world opinion of the publicity which is being received by current talks between Arab statesmen.89. Among the Arabs, the imminence of the preparatory Conference onArab unity in Egypt gave rise to a good deal of inter-party lobbying as to who should represent the Palestinian Arab community. Only on the eve of theConference was it learnt that Musa Alami (a brother-in-law of Jamal Husseini)would attend.  He is an Arab of good family and standing.
90. Among the Jews the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to form a jewish Brigade Group was widely welcomed, though it was treated rathergrudgingly by their press as merely a belated recognition of the right to nationalstatus of an Ally.  Arab reactions showed some resentment and suspicion.91. The lull of nearly five weeks in active Jewish terrorism was sharplyinterrupted on the night of the 27th/28th September when there were attacks on four police stations at Haifa, Qalqilya near Tulkerem, Beit Dajan near Jaffa,and Qataa south of Rehovoth. In each case parties of about 25, some wearingmilitary-type equipment, attacked. the police with bombs, automatic weapons and explosives. They were beaten off, except at Qataa, but not without casualties and considerable damage. On the following morning a British AssistantSuperintendent of Police was attacked in Jerusalem by two armed men on his way to office and assassinated. He was a C.I.D. expert in Jewish politicalaffairs.   The assailants escaped.92. Terrorist pamphlets and manifestos continued throughout the month;some sixty further arrests were made.93. The cost-of-living index for August was 255, 11 points higher thanJuly. High prices of certain uncontrolled varieties of fruit (partly seasonal)were the most important factors in pushing up the index.Aden.94. The Imam of the Yemen is preferring claims to an area on the frontier of the Aden Protectorate which has been so. far unadministered. The exactboundary here is uncertain and discussions are to take place near the spot withYemeni officials, but the possibility of an incident cannot be altogether ruled out.Malta.95. The new Governor, Lieutenant-General Sir Edmond Schreiber, assumed the Administration of the Government in Malta on the 26th September.Mauritius.Extension of the Life of the Council of Government.96. The life of the existing Council of Government is to be extended for another year in accordance with the wishes expressed in the Council and supported by general opinion in Mauritius.97. In announcing this decision the Governor has been authorised to statethat His Majesty&apos;s Government intends to press on with consideration of the revision of the Constitution.Ceylon.98. It was announced on the 19th September that Sir Henry Moore, atpresent Governor of Kenya, is to succeed Sir Andrew Caldecott as Governor of&apos;Ceylon.Ceylon Constitution Commission.99. Lord Soulbury&apos;s acceptance of the invitation to act as Chairman ofthe Commission, and the Commission^ terms of reference, were announced on the21st September.  The terms of reference are : &quot; To visit Ceylon in order to examine and discuss any proposals for constitutional reform in the Island which have the object of giving effectto the Declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government on that subject dated the26th May, 1943; and, after consultation with various interests in the Island,including minority communities, concerned with the subject of constitutional reform, to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on all measures necessary to attain that object.&quot;Extension of the Life of the State Council.100. In order to avoid the dislocation of the Island&apos;s war effort which would undoubtedly accompany a general election in present circumstances, an Orderin Council prolonging the life of the present State Council for a further two yearsuntil January 1947 was passed on the 28th September.Fiji and Western Pacific High Commission.101. The appointment of Mr. A. W. G. Grantham, Chief Secretary, Nigeria,to be Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, in succession to Major-General Sir Philip Mitchell, has been announced.
. West Indies.Jamaica.* 102, A disastrous hurricane swept the island on the 20th August,disrupting. road and telegraph communications, doing considerable damage to property and causing very extensive destruction of crops, especially bananas,which form so important a part of the Colony&apos;s economy. The damage was particularly severe-in the north of the island, but only slight in the capital,Kingston. Twenty-six deaths and 60 serious injuries were caused. Local reliefcommittees have been appointed in each of the parishes mainly affected, and withthe aid of the military temporary measures were taken for accommodation and feeding where necessary. I have informed the Governor that&quot; His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be prepared to invite Parliament to authorise an interest-freeloan from United Kingdom funds of  500,000 in the first instance to be re-lentto individuals by the Government of Jamaica.British Guiana.103. I have accepted the majority report of the Franchise commission which recommends a very substantial reduction of the franchise qualifications,but one still falling short of universal suffrage. The matter is one on which thereis considerable division of opinion locally, and certain sections of the EastIndian community are strongly in favour of universal suffrage. After discussionwith the Governor, however, I have come to the conclusion that I should acceptthe recommendations of the majority of the very representative local commission with the exception of their proposal for a literacy test confined to English. Onthat point I have approved the retention of the existing test of literacy in anylanguage.United States Bases Legislation.104. My Assistant Legal Adviser has now returned to this country afterpresiding over the Conference in the West Indies of Law Officers from the BasesColonies to discuss the draft Bills to implement the United Kingdom-UnitedStates Bases Agreement. Certain matters of policy have arisen as a result ofthe Conference, which are now under urgent consideration. As soon as these have been settled the way will be clear for the early introduction of the necessary legislation in the Bases Colonies.East Africa.105. The following appointments of Governors have recently beenapproved : Sir P. E. Mitchell (Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner for the western pacific) to be Governor of Kenya.Sir J. H. Hall (Governor of Aden) to be Governor of Uganda.Sir W. D. Battershill (Deputy Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office)to be Governor of the Tanganyika Territory.
