THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. v/ Copy No.i wW.P. (44) 580.2&amp;th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.TRAVEL FACILITIES-VISITS BY NON-OFFICIAL CIVILIANS TOFRANCE, BELGIUM AND HOLLAND.Memorandum by the Minister of State.AT their meeting on the 16th October (W.M. (44) 137th Conclusions, Item 7)the War Cabinet considered the difficulties experienced by British press correspondents and other civilians in securing passages to France. They were informed that important civilians who had good reasons for visiting France hadbeen unable to obtain passages, but that the Americans apparently found nodifficulty in arranging journeys for American nationals. The general view ofthe War Cabinet was that, if there was ground for complaint in this matter,the issue should be taken up with General Eisenhower, but that as a first stepa detailed statement should be prepared giving particulars of the cases in whichpassages had been refused to British nationals and evidence to show that american citizens had obtained passages with less difficulty.2. Although overseas travel is primarily the concern of the Home Office,the Foreign Office is so placed that it may be convenient if I explain the arrange-ments under which applications from British subjects for permission to travel to France, Belgium, and Holland are dealt with. Every person leaving&apos;thiscountry requires an exit permit unless exempted. The main exempted classes are Servants of the Crown and members of the Forces and of auxiliary Services,such as the British and American Red Cross. As long as the whole of france was an operational zone, civilians were required to obtain military permits beforeexit permits were granted, and the latter were granted by the Passport andPermit Office only on the recommendation of a Government Department. This,in turn, would only be given if the application fell within the terms of the directive issued by General Eisenhower. The Foreign Office were oftenconsulted by the Department concerned in such cases. Most applicants for facilities for travel for private or business reasons were thus turned down bythe Department to which they applied without reference to S.H.A.E.F.; a certainnumber of persons who applied to S.H.A.E.F. in the first instance were eitherrefused facilities forthwith or referred to the Foreign Office.3. The only civilians who were permitted to travel into the operationalzone were Government officials or persons whose applications were supported bythe President of the United States or by the Prime Minister or by United states or British Service Departments. The arrangements for obtaining permission for non-official civilians to travel to France were mentioned to the War Cabinetby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 25th September (W.M. (44)126th Conclusions, Item&apos;8);&apos; at General Eisenhower&apos;s request the arrangements were modified so that, when the War Cabinet Offices communicate names toS.H.A.E.F., the telegram sent intimates that the applications have the PrimeMinisters approval. These arrangements have&apos; only been invoked in cases inwhich the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is personally assured of theimportance of the visit in general British interests. S.H.A.E.F. have grantedfacilities in every case which has been submitted to them under this procedure.4. It has thus been necessary to refuse permission to a number of personswho may be classified broadly as follows : (a) bankers;(b) business men in general (including one or two M.P.s);12548   [28478]
(c) representatives of organisations,such as the L.C.C., the British Councilof Churches, and two or three Jewish organisations;*  (d) miscellaneous private persons; ......(e) Commander Stephen King-Hall, M.P., who was refused permission inaccordance with the War Cabinet decision of the 29th August(W.M. (44) 112th Conclusions, Item 5).The cases in which&apos; the Ministry of Information are interested are given inAppendix A to this paper.5. As regards complaints that American business men have found it easier to arrange for representatives to go to France than have their British competitors,there appear to be two,loopholes. The majority of complaints concern the facultywith which American&apos;business men have been able to go to France disguised in uniform. It has not hitherto been possible to obtain concrete evidence that such&apos;facilities have been given improperly, nor would it be easy to obtain such evidence in view of the fact that in most cases it is probably arguable that there was amilitary interest in the journey. Any American business men who went to france in uniform were presumably passed through the military control machinery.Large numbers of United States citizens arrive in this country for purposesconnected with the welfare of the United States Forces. On arrival they aresupplied with United States Army cards and made technically members of theForces, thus becoming exempt from the Aliens Order and the requirement toobtain exit permits. It is inevitable that among these persons there should be many with business interests and possible that some may have contrived theirjourney for the purpose of furthering those interests.6. Apart from this there is reason to believe that, owing to the lax controlat United States airfields in this country, non-official civilians (British sls wellas American) have occasionally been able to travel to France by private arrange-ment with American pilots; but here, too, it is obviously difficult to producespecific details. The departure from this country of a civilian without the leave of an Immigration Officer is a penal offence and where evidence is obtainable thepersons concerned are being prosecuted. Where the names of the service personnelcan be ascertained, it is suggested that they should be reported to S.H.A.E.F.for disciplinary action to be considered.7. Now that the greater part of France, including Paris, has been declaredan &apos;&apos; interior &apos;&apos; - zone, travellers to that part of France no longer require amilitary permit-and-the--main-limiting factors on visits to France will betransport and the regulations regarding exit permits. The S.H.A.E.F. ban on private visits will remain as regards (a) the &quot;forward&quot; zone in France, and(b) Belgium and Holland, but exit permits will be granted for travel to the&apos;&apos; interior &apos;&apos; zone for business visits certified by a Government Department tobe in the national interest.8. As soon as it was known that arrangements were under discussion between Supreme Headquaters and the French authorities with a view to the transformation of the greater part of France into an interior zone, an announce-ment regarding travel to France was prepared and received the concurrence ofthe Departments concerned. The text of this announcement is given inAppendix B to this paper : in view of the shortage of transport it was stifflyworded in order to discourage rather than to invite applications. Meanwhile,arrangements had been made for the Department of Overseas Trade to siftapplications from business firms wishing to send representatives to France, sothat a list could be drawn up with a view to giving priority, when the time came, to approved business travellers. The Department of Overseas Trade aremaking arrangements with the Passport and Permit Office and the PrioritiesBoard to deal with all applications as rapidly as jDossible and it is expectedthat the first business men on the Department of Overseas Trade&apos;s list will beable to leave for France very shortly. There should also be no difficulty now about the departure for Paris of M.P.S, press correspondents and others in whomthe Ministry of Information are interested, or representatives of British organisa-tions and institutions which we wish to see renew their contacts with France.9. While there is unlikely to be any great pressure from business or other interests in this country for facilities to travel to that part of France whichremains a &quot; forward&quot; zone, the fact remains that the United States businessman in uniform in this country can take advantage of the many facilitiesafforded by United States Service transport for proceeding to airfields in the
&quot;interior&quot; zone, whereas British civilians will be confined to the limitedtransport available for civilian travel. I do not, however, consider (and this applies also to Belgium and Holland) that there is any case for representations to General Eisenhower unless more concrete evidence of discrimination is forthcoming.10. I have, I hope, made clear the difficulties which have arisen in thecase of travel to France and which may continue in the case of Belgium and holland. A complete solution of these difficulties is, for the reasons, given,probably impossible, but the Foreign Office will at all times be ready to con-sider with sympathy cases which can properly be brought within the scopeof the procedure described in paragraph 3 above.11.   This paper has been prepared in consultation with the Home Office.R. L.Foreign Office, 2Qth October, 1944.APPENDIX A.THE Ministry of Information are interested in providing for travel facilities to France for the following categories of persons : *(a) Newspapers. (All the leading newspapers want to re-open their Parisoffices. Applications have been received from the Continental daily mail, the Daily Telegraph, the Financial Times, the New Leader, andtwo American concerns.(b) Distribution of Newspapers and Books. The Ministry of Informationconsider it to be urgently necessary to re-establish the services providedby W. H. Smith and Son, William Dawson and Son, and ContinentalPublishers on the Continent as soon as possible.(c) Book Publishers An application- has been received from the AlbatrosContinental Library, which is the only large-scale undertaking onthe Continent devoted entirely to the publication of English and american literature.(d) Dubbing of Films for the Ministry of Information. Lingua Synchrome(Limited) has been carrying out lip-synchronisation of films in Franceand in this country. The French require that dubbing should be donein France. The return to France of French artistes in additionmakes it difficult for this work to be continued here.(e) Political Non-accredited Correspondents. S.H.A.E.F. refuse to allowPress representatives to remain in a forward zone unless they are accredited war correspondents in uniform. They recently, however,at the Ministry of Information^ request, provided facilities for asmall party of diplomatic, correspondents to pay a short visit to Paris.APPENDIX B.Statement issued by the Home Office on the 22nd October.NOW that a considerable part of France, including Paris, has been declaredan &quot; interior zone,&quot; civilians wishing to travel to that part of France no longerrequire military permits, but only exit permits and French visas.It will be appreciated, however, that no sea transport for civilians is atpresent available, and the very limited amount of air transport available for civilians, as well as other considerations, must for some time to come severelyrestrict the volume of civilian travel to France. For the time being, therefore,applications for exit permits by persons wishing to travel to France can beconsidered only in cases in which the journey is certified by the competentGovernment Department as being on urgent business of national importance,prospective travellers should not apply to the Passport and Permit Office forexit permits until so advised by the Government Department concerned. Thegrant of an exit permit and visa will not necessarily mean that transport will immediately be available.No applications can be entertained from persons wishing to travel to that part of France which is still an operational zone.
