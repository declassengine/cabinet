In these attacks 396 Japanese aircraft were reported destroyed and 41 ships sunk; only 45 U.S. aircraft were lost.[Details of attacks by heavy bombers from China are given in the Air Situation. ]Up to the 17th only two U.S. warships had been damaged by aircraft torpedoattacks. This disposes of the fantastic claims made by the Japanese. A force of heavy Japanese ships.came within sight of the U.S. Fleet on the 16th but with-drew immediately without giving action. xAnti-Submarine Operations.14. Seven attacks were reported during the week, six of them by warships and one by carrier-borne aircraft.On the 16th His Majesty&apos;s Canadian frigates sank an outward-bound U-boatsouth-east of the Faroes; 44 prisoners were taken.

Mission Bay (escortcarrier) possibly sank another in the same area. During the raid on Bergenby Bomber Command on the 4th one U-boat was probably sunk and anotherpossibly sunk.Enemy Intelligence.15. Photographic reconnaissance -on the 18th showed the Tirpitz atTromso surrounded by a boom. It is confirmed that she is considerably damagedforward.The koln is reported to have joined &quot;the Emden in minelaying operations in the Skagerrak.The Scheer was seen at Swinemiinde on the 15th.U-boats.16. Four or five U-boats are outward bound from Norwegian bases and two are operating in Canadian waters, otherwise the situation is quiet.Protected accommodation for about eight U-boats is available at Trondheim&quot;and a heavily protected base is under construction at Bergen.   Protected accom-modation is also available at Hamburg, Kiel and Heligoland.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17. The naval water tanker Petronella (2,770 tons) was mined and sunksouth of Piraeus on the 15th.No attacks by U-boats or aircraft have been reported during the.week.
Allied Minelaying.18.   Surface craft have laid mines off the south-west coast of Ireland (R).^ Mines have been laid by naval aircraft in Norwegian waters and by aircraft of *Bomber Command in the Kattegat.One of H.M. submarines has laid mines in the Malacca Strait.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping, -19.   There have been no reports of minelaying in Home Waters.The initial mine clearance of the approach channel, anchorage and Rade Abrihas been completed at Brest. The initial clearance of the Seine as far as Rouenhas also been completed, and ships up to 18 feet draught can now be accepted.Minesweeping at Calais between the breakwater and the Avant Port was completed on the ilth. Four mines have been destroyed in the channel betweenDieppe and Havre, and eight magnetic mines have been destroyed in the approachchannel to Havre.   The French are clearing the Seine above Rouen.&quot;20. A moored minefield has been declared west of Marseilles. The ports ofNice and La Ciotat have been declared safe. Many drifting mines, probably laidby E-boats, have been reported off San Remo.During recent sweeping operations in the Korcula channel off the Dalmatiancoast 128 mines have been destroyed.A channel has been swept from the south of Cephalonia to the Patras Roads.Over 70 mines have been destroyed in this area.A moored minefield off ^Egina Island delayed the entry of naval forces toPiraeus.. HM. minesweepers Lame and Clinton were damaged and four smallercraft were sunk.The mine totals are : 5,758 ground and 6,227 moored. M.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21; Between the 16th and the 30th September 16 enemy ships, totalling52,758 tons, were sunk or captured or became constructive total losses. Of these,five ships, totalling 8,246 tons, were lost in the Mediterranean.22. It was reported on the 13th that the Kiel Canal had been blocked for five days after a steamer had been sunk by mine near the canal entrance at Brunsbuttel.Some ten or 12 ships, held up by the mining of the canal, were reported to beanchored off Langeland on the 10th.Russian Intelligence.23. Seven or ten Russian submarines are reported to have recently passed outof the Gulf of Finland, proceeding through the Finnish Skerries; these arenow apparently operating off the Baltic States and in the Southern Baltic. the danish steamer Hilma, Lau (2,414 tons) was sunk on the 12th, N.E. of Bornholm,by -a Russian submarine.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.24. Although the general picture remains little changed since last week,and progress in terms of ground won has been modest, extremely hard fightinghas taken place at several places on the Allied front. The enemy has presented^increasingly strong resistance, though his Counter-attacks have been purely local and lacking in weight.Outstanding incidents have been the complete encirclement and entering ofAachen by U.S. forces, and the linking of the Canadian bridgehead south of the scheldt with troops fighting their way north from the Leopold Canal.Southern Group of A armies.25. In the Belfort Gap and the Vosges, U.S. and French troops have,advanced steadily but slowly, securing several dominant hill features.Further north, the advance east of Nancy has made further progress, and fighting continues in the strongly fortified approaches to Metz.
Central Group of A armies,26. The only activity on this sector has again been in the Aachen area,where U.S. troops on the 16th closed the gap through which attempts had beenmade to relieve the town, to which German propaganda attaches considerableprestige value. On the same day fighting was reported in the streets, and a house-to-house struggle still continues. An unofficial report states that 9,000 prisonershave already been taken in thisNorthern Group of Armies.27. There have been no positional changes in the tip of the Nijmegen salient,where the enemy has shown himself alert and nervous, but the attack launchedon the 11th on its eastern flank has made some progress towards the Meuse. the village of Overloon was quickly taken, but fighting in the direction of Venraijhas been severe, and it was not until the 17th that fighting was reported in the streets. Progress on this front has been held up both by the difficult and marshynature of the country and by the extensive use of mines by the enemy.The Canadian Army&apos;s operations north of Antwerp have gone well, the main road leading into Beveland and Walcheren Islands having been cut on the 11thand held against repeated enemy attempts to reopen it.In the &quot;fighting to reduce the enemy pocket south of the Scheldt progress hasbeen slow, but the bridgehead has been reinforced and expanded, and on the 14thwas linked with other Canadian troops advancing north from the Leopold Canal.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)28. The weather having improved, both the Eighth and Fifth Armies havebeen able to make more progress than during the previous week.On the 11th, Eighth Army troops, having previously patrolled across theRiver Fiumicino, pushed forward and captured the small towns of Longianoand Montiano. Between these towns and the coast the ground still-&apos;remainedvery water-logged and was unsuitable for any operations by armour. Not untilthe 14th did conditions improve sufficiently for&apos; the coastal troops to resume theiroffensive. On this date Canadian troops established bridgeheads over the RiverRubicone in the area which lies about two miles S.E. of Castellaccio. Exploitingthese bridgeheads, New Zealand forces pushed forward on the 15th to occupyGambetolla; since this date steady progress has been maintained and our forward troops are now within two miles of Cesana and have secured a small bridgeheadacross the Pisciatello River. Further South, Eighth Army troops having, as previously reported, captured Montiano, pushed forward over hilly country and against determined resistance captured Monte Reale on the 17th. This latterfeature, which controls the ridge which runs down to Cesena^-was defended withthe utmost tenacity by the enemy. With the exception of the area immediatelysouth of Cesena, the enemy has been pressed back to the line of the Savio.Between this Eighth Army offensive on the right and the Fifth Army offensive on the left, our mobile forces have followed up enemy withdrawals and have entered numerous villages and small towns. On the night 17th/18th, these-forcesopened up an offensive on the S. Sofia-Galeata axis, which succeeded in gettingas far as Galeata.   Enemy action later forced a withdrawal.The Fifth Army has maintained maximum pressure on the enemy in themountainous country south of Bologna; enemy resistance on this sector remainsvery determined, and with the added difficulty of the mountainous country nospectacular gains have been made. The only other activity which is worthy ofnote is that on the 11th and 12th Brazilian forces drove a deep salient up thevalley of the River Serchio against light enemy opposition.The Campaign in Eastern Europe.   (An outline map is included as,an inset.)Finland.29. The Russians have captured the port of Petsamo, in the extreme north of&quot;Finland, which was ceded to them under the terms of the armistice. In CentralFinland the Germans continue to withdraw northwards.Northern Sector.30.   The Russians have completed the occupation of OEsel.On the 13th they captured Riga and are now some 20 miles to the west of it.They have reached the Baltic coast on both sides of Memel and are within a fewmiles of the East Prussian frontier from the sea to N.W. of Lomza.
The Germans report a new heavy Russian attack W.S.W. of Kovno, but thereis no confirmation of this from the Russians.*Central Sector.31. According to the Germans the Russians have been attacking in the areaN.E. of Warsaw.Balkans Sector.32. In Transylvania the Russians have captured Cluj and Dej and areadvancing north-westwards towards Czechoslovakia. Other Russian forces fromthe north have pushed through the Carpathians into Czechoslovakia on a front of175 miles to a depth of 12-30 miles. The Germans appear to be disengaging fromtheir- dangerous salient in this part of the front.In S.E. Hungary the Russians have made good initial progress in thedirection of Budapest and established a bridgehead across the Tisa. For somedays, however, they have gained no fresh ground.Yugoslavia. c33. The enemy is losing control of the north to south railways throughYugoslavia, which are vitally important for his withdrawal from Greece andAlbania.Partisan troops, together with elements of the Soviet Army, entered Belgradeon the 14th. Nis was occupied on the same day by Partisan and Bulgariantroops. Heavy fighting is reported from the area of Dubrovnik which theGermans are evacuating. ^Greece. -&apos;(An outline map is included as an inset.)34. The Germans had evacuated Athens by the night 13th/14th andBritish troops under command of Lieutenant-General Scobie have occupied thecity. Airborne troops which had dropped on Megara airfield entered the townfrom the west on the 14th, while a British Commando and Greek troops came inby sea. Other British forces reached the Piraeus by sea on the 16th. All havereceived a good welcome in the capital and the atmosphere there is reported tobe quiet.The German evacuation from Southern Greece continues and on the 18thBritish patrols found Thebes (32 miles N.W. of Athens) clear of the enemy.^gean Islands.35. The enemy garrison in Crete is now concentrated in a fortress area inthe western end of the island.Naxos was liberated on the 15th.Albania.36. The Germans are beginning to evacuate Southern Albania and have leftValona.Part of the British Commando force in Southern Albania has now been withdrawn.   This force took over 600 prisoners for the loss of some 80 casualties.Burma.Chindwin. *37. Our troops have captured Tiddim, and are now fighting in the area southof the village. In the Kabaw Valley the advance of East African troops has again been delayed by bad weather.China.38. The Japanese columns driving down the Hengyang-Kweilin Railwayhave advanced both their thrusts and now threaten Kweilin from the N.W. andthe S.E. Further slight gains have been made by the Japanese up the West Riverin the direction of Liuchow.  Kweiping was captured on the 12th.
Pacific.Palcm Islands.39. Garakayo (the island immediately north of Peleliu), with two smallneighbouring islands, was captured on the 11th.AIR SITUATION.General Review.40. Heavy bombing attacks were made on communications and supplycentres in Western Germany and full support was given to Allied troops in the battle area.The M.A.A.F. heavily attacked enemy communications and close supporttargets in Italy, and oil refineries, communications, industrial targets and airfields in South-Eastern Europe.In the Pacific, heavy attacks were made on enemy targets in Borneo andFormosa.United Kingdom.41. Flying bombs were again launched against this country; details are recorded under &quot;Enemy Activity and Home Security.&quot;Home Waters.42. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 999 sorties; four aircraft are missing. .Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping off the Norwegian, Danishand Dutch coasts; one armed trawler was sunk, another was probably sunk, one2,000-ton tanker, two coasters, one minesweeper and one armed trawler were seton fire and six coasters were damaged.Bomber Command aircraft laid 141 sea-mines.* Western Front.43. In the week ending 2100 hours on the 17th, A.E.A.F. aircraft flew13,999 sorties and dropped 2,974 tons of bombs; forty enemy aircraft were destroyed and 27 were damaged in combat for the loss of 57 Allied aircraft.Aircraft of Bomber Command and the U.S. VHF  Command flew 12,399 sortiesduring the week ending dawn on the 19th and dropped 25,040 tons; seven enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and 135 Allied aircraft are missing.  &apos;The main events of the week were heavy day and night attacks on enemy communications and supply centres behind the battle front, the principal targetsbeing Duisburg and Cologne.Duisburg, the great inland port and a key point for the movement of troops and supplies by road, rail and water to-the front, was attacked on the 14th andon the night of the 14th/15th, a total of 9,246 tons of bombs being dropped.During the daylight attack there was drifting cloud over the target and mostof the crews had difficulty in seeing the markers, with the result that bombingwas somewhat scattered. However, good concentrations were achieved in thevicinity of some aiming-points, especially round- the docks. At night the weather was clear, except for some industrial haze and smoke. The markers were well placed and there was a good concentration of bombing. Fires from the previousattack were still burning and a mass of fresh fires was seen from a considerable distance on the home journey.Cologne, which is now of major importance as a traffic centre for supplies to the Siegfried Line, was heavily attacked on the 14th, 15th and 17th; a totalof 6,794 tons was dropped. The results of the attack on the 15th were described as fair to good; the other two were carried out by means of pathfinder techniqueand results were unobserved. A further 250 tons were -dropped in small-scaleattacks on the city.Among other communications and supply centres bombed were Brunswick(858 tons), osnabruck (618 tons), Bonn (611 tons), Kaiserslautern (295 tons) andSaarbriicken (215 tons). Brunswick and Bonn were attacked in good weather and satisfactory results were achieved; in the attacks on the other three targetsPathfinder technique was employed. Photographs taken after the attack0 onOsnabriick show that considerable damage was caused to the railway centre.&apos;* The results of some of these attacks  are given in Appendix VII.
Attacks were also made on other types of targets in Germany, includingWiiheimshaven (2,210 tons), tank and M.T. works at Cassel (777 tons), a synthetic oil* plant in&quot; the Ruhr (563 tons), an aircraft components factory at Bremen(558 tons), the Sorpe dam, near Dortmund (16 x 12,000-lb. bombs), oil refineriesat Monheim and Reisholz (281 tons), an M.T. factory at Cologne (207 tons), aproducer-gas factory at Cologne (196 tons) and chemical works at Leverkiisen(100 tons). Thin layer cloud was encountered over Wiiheimshaven, but mostof the markers fell accurately round the aiming point, which received some heavybombing. A Mosquito which flew over the target about 40 minutes after the attack reported several fires. Photographs show that heavy damage was caused to the oil plant in the Ruhr and to the factory at Bremen. Weather was clearover the Sorpe dam, although there was some cloud in the area. Owing to cloud and smoke all that can be seen on photographs taken during the attack are three craters on the crest of the dam with possibly two others near the edge ofthe water. Small-scale attacks were made on several other targets, includingHamburg, Berlin, Hanover and Mannheim.In the battle area, Lancasters and Mosquitoes dropped 531 tons on a coastalbattery at Fort Frederik Hendrik, near Breskens, and 291 tons on the sea wallat Westkapelle, on Walcheren. The battery was successfully bombed in goodvisibility. The attack on the sea wall went according to plan and bombing wasaccurate. A Mosquito which carried out a reconnaissance an hour after the attack saw delayed action bombs bursting in the target area. Fighters and fighter-bombers provided full support for Allied troops in the battle area and also attacked railways, M.T., bridges, ferries and strong points. Railway lines were cut in numerous places and many bridges, locomotives, vehicles and barges were destroyed or damaged.A total of 2,719 sorties were flown by aircraft carrying supplies to France,Belgium and Holland.The most interesting feature of enemy offensive activity was a number of bombing attacks, chiefly against Allied airfields in Holland, by Me. 262 jet-propelled aircraft. These attacks were usually on the scale of five to ten aircraft aday. Fighter activity on tactical operations declined further, the average dailyeffort by close support forces was about 100 sorties, against 200 last week. the night fighter force was not employed to its full capacity; activity was on a very low scale and sorties on any one night did not exceed 40.Mediterranean Front.44. During the week ending the 17th, aircraft of the M.AA.F. flew a totalof .12,162 sorties, of which 4,128 were heavy bombers; 9,274 tons of bombs were dropped. A total of 151 Allied aircraft (including 80 heavy bombers) is missing and 49 enemy aircraft were shot down.M.A.A.F. heavy bombers attacked close support targets in the Bologna area,and, in South-Eastern Europe, oil refineries, railway centres and many industrial targets. Other aircraft attacked close support targets in the Italian battle area,enemy airfields and transport in Hungary, and many other targets in the M.A.A.F.areaEnemy air activity in Italy was on a negligible scale, but some operations by allied bombers over Germany and Austria met considerable opposition.Italy.45. On the 12th, in the Bologna area, heavy bombers attacked numerousground support targets, including a munition factory, ammunition dumps, work-shops, barracks and stores depots; in this attack, 1,133 tons were dropped withgenerally good results. On the same and the next day, a total of 546 medium bombers attacked similar targets in the same area. Other successful attacks, by afurther 582 medium bombers, were made on railways, roads and bridges; at leastnine of these latter were hit and other severe damage effected. Heavy attacks,on close support targets and communications in rear of the battle area, were madeby a total of about 3,750 light bombers, fighter-bombers and fighters (16 missing).Many good results were achieved, including the destruction of a 30-car ammunitiontrain and a somewhat smaller one being set on fire; at least 20 locomotives and anumber of railway units, M.T. and barges were destroyed and numerous similarunits damaged. Many hits were also reported on guns, strong points, bridges,roads and railways.
At night, attacks were made by mixed forces of -heavies and mediums on railway centres at Verona, Bronzola (south of Bolzano) and another centre; inaddition, Wellingtons attacked a pontoon bridge at San Benedetto. A total of246 bombers (5 missing) carried out these operations and dropped 563 tons.In the Gulf of Venice, Beaufighters damaged a medium-sized merchant ship and in the north Adriatic sank or damaged a number of small craft. In theArsa Channel1 (north Adriatic), similar aircraft successfully attacked 41 vesselsloaded with troops and stores. Other attacks were carried out against smallharbours, hits being made on jetties, small craft and 3 E-boats.South-E&quot;astern Europe.46. In attacks by Allied fighters on a number of airfields in Hungary andone in Czechoslovakia about 120 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the groundDuring these and other operations by fighters at least a further 40 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat. Successful attacks were also made by Allied-fighterson enemy transport, principally between Budapest and Vienna; 105 locomotives and many M.T. and rail-road cars were destroyed and 900 railway cars damaged.Operations by heavy bombers, although carried out on an extensive and heavy scale, were on some days considerably hampered by bad weather. The oil refineries at Blechhamer (55-miles S.E. of Breslau 1,056 tons in three attacks),Vienna/Floridsdorf (196 tons), Odertal (163 tons) and Brux (69 tons) were attacked with good results and bombing was reported to be well concentrated.Railway centres, principally in Hungary and southern Germany, were attacked and road, rail and river traffic between Budapest, Gyor and Vienna was heavily bombed; in these operations about 1,500 tons was dropped and, in a number ofinstances, very severe damage was observed. In other attacks, a further bombtonnage of about 1,500 tons was dropped on industrial and other targets, includingthe Skoda works, the industrial area of Vienna, and a benzol plant and ordnancedepot at Linz. Fighters provided escorts for ail these operations by heavy bombers.In Yugoslavia, light and, fighter bombers attacked and virtually destroyedSton, a small harbour 20 miles south-west of Dubrovnik. Attacks were madeon the harbour at Split, by a mixed force of, bombers on the railway centre atZagreb (179 tons), communications, transport and oil cisterns, several of these latter being destroyed. In Greece, fighters, attacked enemy transport and manytroops in trains and on the roads. Three attacks were made by Baltimores onMaleme airfield (Crete); Beaufighters carried out a demonstration flight overScarpanto, where white flags and fires were observed. One Liberator carriedsupplies to Poland and two others despatched on a similar mission are missing.Russia.47. The Russian Air Force put forward a considerable effort in support ofthe Petsamo operation. Port installations at Kirkenes were bombed by naval aircraft of the North Sea Fleet; two large enemy transports and 21 small craftare claimed to have been sunk.Russian long-range bombers operated on five nights, all objectives attackedbeing in the Baltic States and East Prussia.The German Air Force has provided some support for ground forces in theextreme north of Finland, and air battles were reported in the Petsamo area.Elsewhere there has been the usual activity by close support forces.Burma.48.
