(44) 551.I       3rd October, 1944.Copy No, 16WAR CABINET.CONDITIONS IN FRANCE AND BELGIUM.Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate herewith, for the informationof the War Cabinet, a report by Major D. Morton on a visit to France andBelgium, which he carried out at the direction of the Prime Minister.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,3rd October, 1944.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT i)Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.REPORT.I arrived in Normandy on the 11th September, spent that afternoon and the morning of the next day with S.H.A.E.F., flew to Paris, where I stayed fromthe 12th September until the afternoon of the 17th September; then flying toBrussels at the request of S.H.A.E.F., whence I returned to Paris on the20th September. After conferring with S.H.A.E.F. at Versailles on the21st September, I returned to London on the 22nd September.2. Throughout this report I use the term S.H.A.E.F. to &quot;signify Air ChiefMarshal Sir A. Tedder, Generals Bedell-Smith and Morgan, though I hadtalks with a number of other S.H.A.E.F. officers, especially Generals Grasset andJulius Holmes of &quot; Civil Affairs.&quot; I unfortunately missed General Eisenhower,but obtained General Bedell-Smith^ formal permission to quote him as representing the official policy of the Supreme Commander.3. One object of my visit being to form a personal impression of politicaland economic conditions in France and Belgium, I interviewed as many of theMinisters of those countries as time and circumstances allowed, and also anumber of their senior officials. I took every opportunity of talking with Frenchand Belgian nationals of different political views, and also consulted with HisBritannic Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Paris and Brussels and their staffs, andthe United States Embassy in Paris. I had no contact with General de Gaulle,but to my great regret failed to meet M. Jeanneney in Paris, though I obtainedsome account of his opinions from a French official in touch with him. Mypersonal observations were necessarily confined to Normandy, Paris, Brusselsand their surroundings. I had intended to fly to the Lille and Lyons districts,but time did not permit.4.   It is too soon to form a final opinion on what is most likely to happeneither in Belgium or in France.   Anything may happen when communications and transport become &quot;more normal.    Meanwhile a revolution is already in[28292] B
progress. Whether this will take a peaceful course or is accompanied by seriousbloodshed and excesses will depend on many things, but certainly on the attitude adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards French and Belgian affairs.Everywhere, admiration for Britain and the United States, especially for theformer and for Mr. Churchill, amounts to veneration. There is a widespreadurge to imitate things British, especially in social conditions and a call for britain to lead Europe. Even in circles which naturally lean towards the U.S.S.R.a preference is openly expressed for carrying out reforms &quot; in the English way.&quot;5. This may not last, but both the Belgian Government and french administration begged me to ask His Majesty&apos;s Government to send at oncequalified persons to teach their people what the English had done and how they thought; above all to tell the people what had happened in the past five years.The French Minister of Information said that France was like Rip van Winkle.Frenchmen had never believed what the Germans said, were critical of the talesthe returned emigres told, but were ready to believe an Englishman in anything.They clamour to know why events happened. I had frequent confirmation of this.French ignorance of present world events and their causes is startling. Frenchand Belgian newspapers, which are over plentiful, are dull. Current events areill-described, either from a lack of knowledge on the part of the editorial staff, orfrom the difficulty of explaining their meaning to a people ignorant of earlierevents on which they depend.6. There are many similarities in the French and Belgian situation, but a profound difference arises from the fact that occupied Belgium was administeredas a unity by a normal Belgian administrative machine acting under Germanorders. &quot; Collaborators,&quot; at present defined in both countries as those whowillingly helped the enemy in their beastly operations, or gladly made large profitsout of their country&apos;s misfortunes, have been proportionately more numerous inFrance than in Belgium. This was due to divided loyalties arising from the partition.of France into an occupied and unoccupied zone, and as between Vichyand the Free French. A majority of Frenchmen, including many still privatelyhesitant about de Gaulle, now consider the existence of the Vichy government after November 1942 to have been a disaster. It would have been far better for france to have been fully occupied and openly ruled by Germans. There is aremarkably intelligent understanding in unexpected quarters of Marshal Petain&apos;original intentions. At the same time, the view is widely held that he personallyis to blame for not having dissolved the Vichy regime after the Allied landing in north Africa. I gained the impression that but fewr demand that the Marshal be punished, but a majority thinks he should stand his trial. I fear that few wouldprotest loudly even were he to be executed.7. The fierce and bitter hatred of Collaborators by the man in the street,both in Belgium and France, makes a deep impression. It is like a religiousfervour, and is felt by many who themselves did little actively to help &quot; Resist-ance.&quot; No French or Belgian Government can rule for long if it does not pursue the guilty with what an Englishman would call vindictive brutality. Shoutsof approval greeted the advice of the President of the Senate at the BelgianAssembly, on the 20th September, that the Government should seek out and ruth-iessly punish all Collaborators. This was the more striking in that the Assemblyas a whole seems a most staid body of middle-aged bourgeois, despite party labels.The extreme &quot;right&quot; shouted as loudly as the &quot;left.&quot; The Gestapo torturechambers may explain the fierceness of this reaction, There is said to be evidence,which a British Court of Justice would accept, that the worst torturers ofFrenchmen were themselves Frenchmen, acting under German orders. This doesnot exculpate the Germans, whose S.S. Korps and Hitler Jugend have certainlyacted independently as wild beasts would lack the will to do.8. My most disagreeable surprise came from the attitude displayed towardsthe war and the future, both in France and Belgium, by many of that class, whoby their birth, wealth or upbringing, ought to lead the people and serve theircountry. Not a few bankers, industrialists and business men have made largeprofits out of the occupation. But, apart from these &quot; Collaborators,&quot; who arechiefly in hiding, the mentality of some I fear many of the same social classseems deplorable and to play into the hands of the extremists. M. Luizet, thevery &quot;able and wildly pro-British Prefect of the Paris Police, reminded me thatat an earlier stage of French history, the Frencb nobility had largely retiredvoluntarily from French political life. In his opinion, there is danger of historyrepeating itself through a similar departure from politics, largely at their own
volition, of the independent upper class bourgeois. This he deplored, though a Socialist, M. Luizet, together with many of his party, which is that of the lateM. Blum, would prefer to see an Assembly representing all French classes andopinions. In this connection I was struck by the lack of correspondence to partylabels of the views expressed by very different people. For the time being at least,to call oneself a Communist. Socialist, Radical or anything else in France meanssomething quite different from what it would do in England or America, if it means anything at all. The present rulers of Russia may understand the pointof view of some French Communists. Karl Marx and Lenin would not. the truth is. probably, that parties still have to crystallise. For the time beingactive politicians\are absorbed in problems of administration and reconstruction.9. In both Belgium and France, the economic situation is the present keyto politics. The crux of the economic situation is Communications and Trans-port.10. The destruction by the enemy of the central Brussels telephone and tele-graph exchange has paralysed communications throughout Belgium. the belgians estimate it to be a three months&apos; job to rebuild, but can do this vyith-out external aid. This in itself is some evidence of the relatively good conditionof Belgian industry. The lack of communications produces curious results.Belgian railways are in good shape. Coal is available, and there is more rolling-stock in the country than in normal times, but trains are not yet running owingto the impossibility of organising traffic without telephones or telegraph. InFrance, communications are slightly better than in Belgium, but transport isworse. S.H.A.E.F.. however, is taking energetic action in both countries to restore the situation as quickly as possible, while both French and Belgianrailway officials are co-operating magnificently.11. In both countries stocks of food-stuffs and the basic necessaries of lifesuffice to meet requirements for some time. In fact, before the paralysis of Frenchtransport brought about by the Allied invasion. I say advisedly that the greatmajority of the French people had suffered less through shortages in supply thanhave the people of this country. Even now I recommend caution before acceptingtales, of serious shortages anywhere in France or Belgium, save in the extremesouth and in large urban or industrial areas, where any real shortage ought onlyto be temporary. In Belgium the position can be illustrated by the horror of acasual cafe acquaintance at my account of the limitation on the production and sale of beer in England.  He marvelled that we still lived.12. Neither Frenchman nor Belgian should be accused of fraud if hecomplains of his hardships and demands relief. Each can only compare his life and circumstance with what he enjoyed in 1940. Neither has knowledge orunderstanding of the difficulties of other countries or of the world economicsituation to-day. This should be explained to them. They are very ready to listen.13. I am arranging to give such details as I learned about the economicsituation in France and Belgium to appropriate Departments, but mention here that both the Belgian and French Administrations seem fully to recognise that national stability depends on providing work for all. As a temporary measure to tide over immediate difficulties, the French Administration has ordered all employers working on German orders to complete them : the Administrationitself assuming responsibility for payment. The Belgian Government has taken the more drastic step of ordering employers to continue paying all men on theirbooks, whether they have worked for them or not. Both Administrations beggedme to invite Flis Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government tosend Missions to the Continent as soon as possible for the purj^ose of placing orders on behalf of the Combined Boards for goods required to support the war effort. The Belgian tool-park is reported by the Government to be in excellentcondition. I recommend a cautious attitude towards opposite statements bythe French about their own industry. The state of communications is such thattfiey cannot know it yet. The present urgent need of both countries is not foodor clothes, but raw materials, though some imports of the former are necessaryto tide over immediate internal transport difficulties and to prime the pump.The &quot;Civil Affairs&quot; Plan &quot;A&quot; needs urgent reconsideration.14.   The continuation in France and Belgium of armed Resistance Move-ments after the need for them has ceased provides a serious problem, but one[28292] n 9
which should not be incapable of solution. In large parts of both countriesResistance comprises the only persons bearing arms. It is principally composedof young men and boys with the volatile temperament of University students,but also possessing a strong sense of their own importance, being fully aware that they have fought bravely to free their country where other andolder men failed. Stories linking these Movements with Communism shouldbe received with caution. The Right-wing bourgeoisie, both in France andBelgium, is putting such tales about without foundation, and finding readylisteners in certain quarters, particularly American, where an exaggerated fearof Communism resides. The reason for this malicious propaganda is not hard to find. In point of fact, Resistance in neither country is as yet controlled bya political party, nor has it become a political movement itself. Every effort should be made to prevent this happening, though there is reason to allowResistance to be proud of itself and to continue its existence in the shape of aClub or &quot; Old Soldiers &quot; Association.15. In Paris and where the writ of the French Administration runs, theF.F.I. is fully under control. Elsewhere, however, particularly in the extremesouth and south-west this is not the case. Here the F.F.I. have attempted to holdup General Patch&apos;s supply columns, demanding petrol, food and transport, butS.H.A.E.F. supported by the French Administration are taking firm action. in belgium the solution is to arm the regular gendarmerie and disarm the BelgianResistance Movement. S.H.A.E.F. has this in hand. In Luxembourg this hasalready begun.16. The question of Resistance in France is made more bitter by thesurprising- but widespread feeling of contempt for the French Army despite thegallant conduct of the new French divisions now fighting in Alsace and Italy.For the time being the French people do not like to mention their Army. Ifselected elements from Resistance are incorporated in the Army, as they shouldbe, they will demand to be formed into special units officered by men who have fought with them.   They will have the support of the French people for this.17 S.H.A.E.F. told me tfyat they are under pressure from London and washington to hand over as much of France as possible to the French Govern-ment as a zone of the interior under the Civil Affairs Agreement. I am authorisedto say it is already S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s policy to do this in all liberated countries. TheFrench Administration now wishes to take over control. At first general de Gaulle did not; preferring to leave the grave responsibility of governmentto S.H.A.E.F. for some time longer, so that in the event of disorders he coulddisclaim responsibility and shelter behind S.H.A.E.F. At a stormy meetingof the French Cabinet. General de Gaulle found himself in a minority of one and bowed to the wishes of his colleagues.18. S.FT.A.E.F. told me that General Eisenhower had decided to tellGeneral de Gaulle that, while viewing with deep sympathy his request for asmuch of France as possible to be declared a zone of the interior, he must first besatisfied that the French Administration is in a position to maintain order in thewhole zone concerned. S.H.A.E.F. readily admits that it has not the means to do this itself, but also agrees that the responsibility rests with S.H.A.E.F.until that responsibility is officially ended by the exchange of appropriatedocuments.19. Relations between S.H.A.E.F. and the French Administration are good.Sir A. Tedder gave his opinion that minor friction has been chiefly the fault ofS.H.A.E.F., which being a military organisation is incompetent to handle the sort of civilian questions which have arisen as a result of unexpectedly rapid progress in the field.20. Relations between S.H.A.E.F. and General de Gaulle are not too easy,and exist as little as possible, perhaps by mutual consent.21. An overwhelming majority of Frenchmen as well as S.TI.A.E.F.consider General de Gaulle to be the only possible figurehead of the Administra-tion at present. I understand that M. Jeanneney agrees. However, the variousFrench people with whom I discussed the matter look on General de Gaulleas something different from the Administration, although he is technically&quot; Prime Minister.&quot; To them de Gaulle is a symbol of the liberation of France.If he proposes (as undoubtedly he does) to descend from this supernatural pedestaland enter the ring of everyday politics in order to become a political leader ofthe State or of a party, the French people will require him to show his paces in
that role and will be very critical. They make no secret of this. They are contentthat elections should be held only when the prisoners and deportees have returnedin about a year&apos;s time. Meanwhile, in Paris and in Normandy they are at presentsatisfied to be governed by the present temporary Administration which is sofar doino- a *ood job in those restricted areas where material conditions allowits writ to run.22. On the whole the French are not yet interested in politics of a pre-wartype They are too busy rebuilding their country. New parties will form.Present party labels have little real meaning. One thing is certain. The term&quot; Gaullist &quot; has disappeared. Its resuscitation in connection with a political party, even with de Gaulle at the head, would not be well received.23. In Belgium the situation is not much clearer. M. Pierlot is so far theonly name which counts. His speech before the National Assembly on the20th September received the heartiest approval of all parties, even though heread it in a dull and lifeless manner. First reactions from the country were equally good. M. Pierlot, however, told me that although he had at first beeninclined to accept the Kegenfs suggestion to re-form his Government and continue in power, which the Socialist party pressed him to do, his politica! friends inthe Conservative party did not support this. A certain M. Moyersoen wouldprobably be asked to form a Government entirely of the Right. Should M. Moyer-soen fail to form a Government, or should his Government fail to maintain order,M. Pierlot would take over &quot; as the last line of defence.&quot; The more solid elements of M. Pierlofs Government, namely, M. Gutt, M. de Schryver, M. Richard andM. Spaak had refused to serve under M. Moyersoen.24. I think the true reason for M. Pierlofs proposed line was his undoubtedweakness of character. The situation is difficult, and he would rather somebodyelse handled it. M. Gutt confided to me that he thought M. Pierlofs attitudedeplorable. The Chamber no longer truly represents the views of the people, whosince 1940 have moved markedly though not necessarily dangerously to the Left.M. Gutt prophesied that a Moyersoen Conservative Government would be regarded by the people as &quot; the same sort of thing that had betrayed them in 1940.&quot;25. The Communist danger in Belgium and France is not immediate.The organised Communist party in France has produced two very capablemembers of the present Administration, whose views seem generally to be of adecidedly uncommunistic character. The same seems true of the organisedBelgian Communist party, which strongly supports the Monarchy, and whoseprincipal quarrel with King Leopold is for having married a commoner. Thereal Communist danger lies in what is at present a small, noisy, semi-criminalelement, fortunately not yet well organised. They are referred to by the Policechiefs of France &quot;and Belgium as &quot; gangsters &quot; and will get dangerous only iflaw and order becomes insecure through an economic collapse.26. Organised labour in France and Belgium has given proof of a well-balanced attitude for the time being and seems prepared to go on acting throughthe Trades Unions. Here again, however, the future will depend on themaintenance of economic stability with employment for all, and a soundrelationship between wages and prices.27. The present rate of exchange in Belgium and France is fictitious.500 francs to the pound in France and 300 Belgian francs to the pound would benearer reality. This will be adjusted, together with internal price levels, in belgium by M. Gutt&apos;s Finance Bill, which will be made public as soon as thenew note issue, printed in London for the purpose, is in his hands. This shouldbe the case by now, though a dangerous situation arose a week ago when rumours of the revaluation of the Belgian franc got around. Farmers and shops wererefusing to sell their produce except at fantastic prices and there was realcause to fear that a continuation of this state of affairs would bring starvationto the urban and industrial districts, and consequent disorder. Owing toprompt action by S.H.A.E.F. it is hoped that the danger has been avoided. InFrance a revaluation of the franc is also intended by the French Governmentand is equally necessary, but this will be a more difficult business than in Belgiumowing to the greater size of the country, unless communications and transportimprove.28. In conclusion, it seems that both in Belgium and France, more in thelatter than in the former, a situation of great delicacy is developing.   On the
one hand, there are ample signs that with firm leadership and good fortune some-thing new and fine might be born out of sorrow and confusion. It is equallypossible for national disorganisation to set in, bringing all sorts of troubles inits train, if there is a lack of leadership at the centre, whether that be due topersonal failure or material conditions. For example, if communications andtransport are not reasonably restored within a month or two, little local govern-ments may be set up in various parts of France. In some districts these mightwell include most undesirable elements. On the whole, however, the chancesseem in favour of the new France successfully clearing its first fences, but it is too soon to determine what will happen at the Elections after the return of the prisoners in Germany. These Elections will prove the first real test of Frenchunity. In Belgium the way seems clearer, if M. Pierlot can provide the necessarylead; but both here and in France, Government policy must move towards the left if it is to succeed. Above all, work must be provided for all who desire it.Wages in general will have to&apos; be raised to a level higher than that of 1939and excessive profits will have to be controlled. In both countries, if the people have confidence in the sincerity of their political leaders, their demands canbe kept within reasonable and practicable bounds.(Signed) D. MOETON.2oth September, 1944.
