THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 19^,44.SECRET. \J Copy No. 3W.P. (44) 581.Vdth October, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY IN ETHIOPIA.Memorandum&quot; by the Minister of-State.I invite-my colleagues&apos; attention to telegrams Nos. 569, 572 and 576j:romAddis Ababa (Annexes I, II and III) containing messages from Lord De La Warrregarding the present negotiations with the Emperor of Ethiopia.2. The Ethiopian Government have refused to agree to a withdrawal of thetime-limit (extended for two months in view of those negotiations) under whichthe Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of the 1st January, 1942, expires on the25th October, 1944. On that date the Ethiopian authorities expect, according tothe notes which they put in regarding the termination of the agreement and theextension of the time-limit, to assume jurisdiction and administration over the reserved Areas in Harar Province, the Ogaden, and the Franco-Ethiopian Rail-way in Ethiopian territory. Lord De La Warr has, however, told the ethiopian government that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not acquiesce in any unilateral action while negotiations continue, and has conveyed to the Ethiopians in themanner described in Annex III that he would break off negotiations if any suchaction took place.3. Lord De La Warr&apos;s present instructions are to secure leases of the reserved Areas in Harar Province and the Ogaden. It is evident, however, thatthe Ethiopian Government are most reluctant to grant these leases, which theymay consider as something like a cession of territory. Furthermore, I- am advised that, in default of a new agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government have no legal right to insist on retaining jurisdiction over these territories since, whenthey re-established the Emperor on his throne and concluded with him the Agree-ment of 1942, they undeniably did so on the basis of re-establishing him assovereign over all his former territories. Having done so, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-&apos;ment obtained by two articles of the Military Convention (Articles 3 and 5) theright to retain under military jurisdiction for the period of the 1942 A greementthe Reserved Areas and the Ogaden respectively.4. As his telegram No. 572 shows, Lord De La Warr thinks it may only bepossible to obtain Ethiopian agreement to these leases if he makes threats of a withdrawal of all British assistance from Ethiopia of every kind. Such a threathas the&quot; danger that, if it were not successful, His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe obliged to carry it out. It seems desirable, therefore, to consider whether further instructions should not be sent tQ Lord De La Warr permitting him topresent alternative proposals to the demand for the leases, which would securethe desiderata, for the sake of which His Majesty&apos;s Government instructed himto demand leases.5.   Our desiderata in these areas are (1) Primarily, and in order to discharge our treaty obligation to protect theBritish Somali tribes, to secure for them their grazing grounds, which he partly in the Ogaden (where they cover a fairly wide strip of thenorth-eastera end of the Ogaden known as the Haud) and partly inthe eastern end of the Province of Harar; and(2) Secondarily, not to prejudice the possibility of the creation of a GreaterSomalia, including the Ogaden, by returning the Ogaden to Ethiopianadministration.    This policy, which has been advocated in certain12542   [28422] B
quarters, has not so far been adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand now seems to be more difficult of realisation if the United StatesGovernment maintain the attitude referred to in paragraph 7 below.0 (3) Further, there is a reluctance to hand over to Ethiopian administration the Somali tribes in the Ogaden whom we have disarmed- a handing over which might provoke sympathetic disorders among tribes in italian Somaliland, who, will remain under our administration, and among &quot;British Somali tribes. The Ogaden tribes have, indeed,already petitioned against any such action.6.   The above desiderata might be sought in the following manner : -Stage A.(1) The Ethiopian Government should be pressed to agree to the Ogaden asa whole being administered by British officials in the name of, and technically asthe servants of, the Emperor until the conclusion of peace. It would be essentialthat freedom of action should be left to the British official administering theterritory, though possibly some concession, such as the flying of the Ethiopianflag and the securing of -the Emperor&apos;s consent for certain measures may benecessary.At the same time, the Emperor should, if possible, be induced to accept theabove while according a lease in the Reserved Areas in Harar Province as alreadyproposed in Lord De La Warr&apos;s instructions. He has already been authorised toaccept a reduction in the area to be leased so as to exclude all land west of therailway.(The rights of the British Somali tribes to use the grazing grounds both inthe Province of Harar and in the Ogaden already exist on the basis of the Treatyof 1897. That treaty did not define the area of these grazing grounds. In 1935an Anglo-Ethiopian Boundary Commission delimited them. However, the areadelimited in 1935 extends beyond the reserved areas in the Province of Harar as defined in the Agreement of 1942 and so further into Ethiopia than experiencenow shows to be sufficient for.our needs. Therefore we should be satisfied with less than the areas defined in 1935 and even with less than the area defined in 1942,and could cite the Boundary Commission of 1935 and the Agreement of 1942 toshow that we were now making a sacrifice in this matter.)Stage B.(2) If agreement cannot be reached on this basis, the following proposal might be put forward as regards the Harar Reserved Areas, the proposals regarding the Ogaden remaining as in A. The rights of the British tribes underthe Treaty of 1897 should be reaffirmed, but it should now be prescribed that theywill, during their migrations in these Reserved Areas, remain under the police and judicial jurisdiction of British authorities, and that the necessary british officers should accompany them during their annual migration into Ethiopianterritory. This jurisdictional concession removes the major difficulty in thepresent position arising from the Treaty of 1897. The subjection to Ethiopianjurisdiction of British Somali tribes is an inevitable source of trouble. We shouldbe prepared to pay a rent, the amount of which might be the subject of bargaining,in order to render this proposal more acceptable.7. If Lord De La Warr is authorised to put the foregoing scheme B to the ethiopian Government and they reject it as well as A, the question arises whether any further concession should be made before His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider the use of extreme threats such as those referred to by Lord De La Warr.The following proposal C would safeguard the essential needs of the Somali tribesunder British protection, but might prejudice the project of a United Somaliaincluding the Ogaden. In this connexion I should mention that the UnitedStates Government seem likely to oppose the inclusion of the Ogaden in a united Somalia on the grounds that &apos;&apos; it is an integral part of the territory of anindependent sovereign State and ally.&quot; This is shown by a memorandum submitted by Mr. Cordell Hull to the President of the United States on the11th September, 1944, of which a copy was given to the Prime Minister at Quebec.Stage C.British Somali tribes would during their migrations to the Reserved Areasin Harar and to the grazing grounds in the Ogaden, remain under the police andjudicial jurisdiction of the British authorities and the necessary British officers
should accompany them as in paragraph 6 (2) above. Subject to this the Ogadenwould revert to Ethiopian jurisdiction.        ,; - -It should be realised, however, that if we relinquish control of the Ogadendifficulties may subsequently arise in that-(a) The return to Ethiopian administration will be resented by theMohammedan Somali tribes of the Ogaden.-(b) We have disarmed these tribes and they look to us for protection. their return to Ethiopian rule might lead to disturbances having repercussions-sions not only in Italian Somalia, but also in British Somaliland.(c) The Ogaden is ethnologically part of Italian Somalia and bestadministered with it, and the problem of grazing rights for ItalianSomali tribes in the Ogaden (which furnished the Italian Governmentwith the pretext for their attack on Ethiopia) will at once arise ifi an acute form. v(d)&apos; The main land line of communication between Kenya and British Somali-land crosses the Ogaden, and special provision will have to be made tosafeguard it.g.. I invite the Cabinet to authorise Lord De La Warr to proceed in his negotiations by stages A&quot;, B and C above, if necessary. The only practicablealternatives to this course seem to be-(a) to make use of the threats suggested in his telegram No. 572 (namely,-  to withdraw the British Military Mission and Advisers, and withhold-. all financial assistance); or ^ .. ,&apos;(b) to state that the British military forces will remain in occupation ofthe grazing areas in Harar and of the Ogaden by force of arms ifnecessary; or(c) to state both of these things as he himself proposes. -The objection to (a) is that there is a risk of the. threat failing to produceits effect and of His Majesty&apos;s Government being obliged to carry out whatthey have threatened. This means;the sacrifice of practically the whole british position in Ethiopia. -The disadvantage of (b) is that it means holding on by military force to the territory of an ally without any legal justification, a course for which His Majesty&apos;s Government may be severely criticised by a sectioniofopinion in this country which is always most sympathetic to Ethiopia;, indeed;,in the light of the whole story of the Ethiopian War and of our relations withEthiopia during that period, I would be afraid that.criticism would by no meansbe confined to that relatively narrow section which maintains an almostprofessional interest in Ethiopian affairs. There are, of course, wider objectioasto infringing by force the territorial rights of a small ally whose independencewe have so recently recognised; The parallel is unlikely to be lost upon theErench in their dealings with the Levant States. Lord De La Warr does notthink hostilities would result, but of course if they did they might prove to bean embarrassing military-commitment at the present time. * -.9. There is perhaps another alternative to break off negotiations aridto conclude no agreement without first making the threats mentioned above in a last effort to obtain one. The failure of Lord De La Warr&apos;s Mission would lead to the sacrifice of certain advantages which seem clearly obtainable, andsuch a rupture would prejudice the position and influence of the British military mission and Advisers, and, indeed, remove any treaty basis for their remaining in Ethiopia. To leave the Emperor without any financial assistance might mean either that the administration of the country would deteriorate into chaosor that the Emperor would obtain financial aid from other sources. We mightlose the guarantee which we are promised as regards the special judicial system to be applied to British subjects, and companies, and the prospect of obtainingcivil and military aviation rights. The withdrawal of the Military Mission. would be likely to prejudice the control of the Ethiopian frontiers and affectneighbouring. British territories. The position of the Ethiopian Railway isimportant and some interruption in the. flow, of Ethiopia&apos;s supplies to the middle east would be inevitable. .      %Emally, it may be that, such a rupture would prejudice certain furtherobjects which are not directly involved in the present negotiations, for instance.tb$ Tana barrage and frontier adjustments necessary to secure more satisfactoryboundaries, from the administrative and ethnological points of view, with tlfeSudan and Kenya. .[28422] b 2
10. Assuming that Lord De La Warr continued his negotiations, it is clearthat they will not be terminated by the 25th October, when the extended noticefor*the termination of the Agreement of 1942 runs out. The question arises,therefore, as to what His Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude should be to anEthiopian demand to resume jurisdiction in the Reserved Areas on the 25thOctober while the negotiations are still continuing. I suggest that we havestrong grounds for insisting that the status quo must be preserved until the endof the negotiations, and that to retain the Reserved Areas including the Ogadeneven by military force if necessary, only for the period while the negotiations are still going on, is not open to the same criticism as retention by force after theend of negotiations.In the first place, Lord De La Warr has already stated there must be nounilateral action during negotiations. Secondly, it is not reasonable for theEmperor to expect the G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa,. to, be ready to evacuate the reserved Areas (an operation which must necessarily take some time) during thenegotiations, when the British proposals for retention of British administrationof tihese areas are still under discussion. Thirdly, the negotiations must be looked at as a whole, and the Ethiopians themselves have said they will not beprepared to discuss in detail the financial proposals until the 24th October.I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that instructions should be sentto the G.O.C.-in-C. informing him that he must be prepared to remain in control of the Reserved Areas and the Ogaden at any rate until Lord De LaWarr&apos;s negotiations are completed and, in so far as any precautions arenecessary to safeguard against any disturbances, he should take them. In theevent of it becoming necessary to withdraw our military administration entirelythe G.O.C.-in-C. must, of course, take all necessary precautions to safeguardhis personnel and equipment during the whole period of withdrawal.R: L.Foreign Office, 19th October, 1944.ANNEX I.Mr. Howe to Mr. Eden.(No. 569.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) A ddis A baba, 14th October, 1944.D.W. 21.Your telegram No. 358.The position regarding reserved areas and Ogaden is that I have informed the Emperor privately and the Ethiopian delegation in the course of our discussions that under your instructions to me continued British occupation ofthese areas is essential condition of new agreement and at the Ethiopians&apos;request I have given their delegation a memorandum setting out reasons whichjustify this attitude. Ethiopian delegation have contested our view from the start but they now have my memorandum under consideration and I do not yetknow what their final reply will be.2. I have pointed out to them that the new agreement must be regarded as awhole and that His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed to make large concessions to their views on all points except that of reserved areas and Ogaden and I ambeing as conciliatory as possible in dealing with other articles. I have also pointedout that our willingness to arrange lease of reserved areas emphasises theEmperor&apos;s sovereignty over it.3. I have not attempted to prolong the period beyond 25th October asafter your acceptance of the position as stated in your telegram No. 326 the requests would only have been refused, with the consequent weakening of ourposition. o4. I did, however, inform them that we could not acquiesce in any unilateral action on their part pending outcome of negotiations. Would appreciate yourassurance that you would approve if necessary my repeating statement that wecould not acquiesce in such action, that it would be resisted by the military and civil authorities and that on Ethiopia&apos;s entry in any form, military or civil, into any part of these areas I should immediately break off negotiations and leave thecountry. Whilst I ask you to envisage this action I would not like you to thinkthat I am by any means yet assuming that the need for it will necessarily arise.It is, indeed, less likely to arise if the Ethiopians are convinced we have-no intention of weakening.
ANNEX II.Mr. Howe to Mr. Eden.(No. 572.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Addis Ababa, IQth October, 1944.. D.W. 24. - &apos; - - [Think you would be wise to be considering the policy in the event of finalbreakdown of negotiations irrespective of any incidents that may occur on25th October.   I believe that after consultation with the Minister and the whole;delegation that there is little or no doubt of obtaining agreement if we are pre^ .pared in the last resort to withdraw British Military Mission to Ethiopia andBritish Commissioner of Police, cease all financial help, including that of pur-:chasing exports in any greater quantity and at any greater price than we need.   IfI am wrong in this belief and wo had to make these withdrawals, then decision;would be required as to vacating reserved areas according to the legal positionor holding on by force until peace settlements.   On the merits of the situation ihere I believe the second course would be right, but you would doubtless wishto consider in the light of wider home and foreign political issues.   It would assist me in determining strength of stand to adopt to know your views as faras possible on these ultimate issues.   If at any point you are prepared to weaken,I do not wish to make British humiliation the greater by saying too much now.I repeat that I am by no means hopeless about achieving agreement by happiermeans, but with such unpredictable people we must be prepared for alleventualities.As finance likely to play large part in forthcoming negotiations, your telegranrNo. 360 most welcome.ANNEX III.Mr. Howe to Mr. Eden.(No. 576.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Addis Ababa, 17-th October, 1944.(D.W. 29.De Blesson, French representative, called on the Minister and myselfyesterday and informed us that during a period when his negotiations aboutAfambo appeared to him to be going exceedingly well, the Ethiopian liaison officer at Jibuti, accompanied by forty armed men, called on the French military commander at Afambo and demanded that he surrender the post. TheCommander stood firm and refused to do so, with the result that the Ethiopianswithdrew.Afambo for many reasons is not a strict parallel with our reserved areas,but I feel this incident to be worth reporting to you.I have felt it desirable to convey to the Ethiopians through one of theirBritish advisers in such a^ manner as not to make an issue of the matter, thatour negotiations would be immediately broken off if they took any action of either,a military or civil,character in the reserved areas or Ogaden while negotiations are in progress. For this and other reasons the general feeling here is that theywill do nothing. I trust, however, that there is sufficient possibility of actionon their part for it to be desirable that your reply to my telegrams 569 and.572.should arrive soon and be of a firm character.
