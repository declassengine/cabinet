(44) 578. \)19th October, 1944,WAR CABINET.SITUATION IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDS.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.AT their meeting on the 16th October, 1944, the War Cabinet* invited usto report on the situation in the Channel Islands.2. In the light of all information now available, we have no hesitation instating that, if supplies are sent to the Channel Islands for the civilian population,the supply of food available to the enemy garrison in the Islands would last intothe summer of 1945, i.e., probably some four or five months longer than it would if no supplies were sent.3. The evidence available indicates that the civilian population in the islands can live, certainly until the end of the year, and possibly a little longer,with hardships but without actual starvation.4. Subject, to the views of the Ministry of Health, we therefore recommendthat no supplies of, food should be sent to the Islands at this stage. We have noobjection to medical supplies and comforts such as soap being sent.5. We think it important that the local German Commander should beinformed by sure means that he is held personally responsible for -the generalwell-being of the civilian population.(Signed) C. A.
