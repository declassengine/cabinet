THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 552.2nd October, i944.WAR CABINET.SUPPORT FOR POLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith for their information :  . (1) A translation of the more important passages of an article by the Polish&apos;Minister of Education, which appealed iii the Polish periodical Sprawa;published in this country, on the 31st August;(2) A minute by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to Poland recording his repre-sentations to the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to this article.A. E.Foreign Office, 2nd October, 1944.Article by the Polish Minister of Education in &quot; Sprawa&quot; (&quot; common cause,&quot; orga&apos;n of the Polish section of the &quot; Sword of the Spirit&quot;),No. 13/14, 31st August, 1944.&quot; What are we fighting for . &quot; by the Right Rev. Mgr. Z. Kaczynski.After some introductory references to the moral principles proclaimed byleaders of the Allies, the article continues :  &apos;&apos; But what has been the reality of things with regard to Poland lately \Here are some facts : &quot; 1. According to press reports during the last eighteen days only100 planes, of which 26 were lost, were sent to help fighting Warsaw.Meanwhile, the small Polish forces in exile put every day more than100 planes at the disposal of Britain, and I should add that in the battle of Britain in 1940, 50 per cent, of the Polish air crews in this country werecasualties. The capture of Monte Cassino involved several thousands ofkilled and wounded for the Polish Second Corps. Even if I do not mentionother losses, the difference between the sacrifice made to help bleeding Warsawand our contribution to this war is striking.&apos;&apos; 2. During the first years of this war we heard much praise for Polandfrom Allied statesmen. Many promises and pledges were given us that poland would recover all her territories. Was she not &apos; the inspiration ofthe world ? &apos; Paragraph 3 of the Protocol to the Polish-British Treaty ofthe 25th August, 1939, clearly provided that Great Britain recognised the integrity of the Polish State. Furthermore, the Foreign Secretary,&quot;Mr. Eden,in his letter to the Polish Prime Minister, dated the 30th July, 1941, stated- that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom did not recogniseany territorial changes made in Poland after August 1939.To-day Poland is asked to renounce 48 per cent, of her nationalterritory, inhabited by more than 12 million people. Is it we, who aredecimated and bleeding, who are to pay the cost of this war? We, whohave always been faithful to our pledges; we, who have not produced Hachaor Quisling, are to be more wronged than anyone else ? How in such case is it permissible to talk about law and justice ?12528   [28322]
&quot; 3. We are threatened not only with the loss of half of Poland but also with the complete loss of our independence. Both the British and american governments are doing their best to disinterest themselves in the polish question and to adopt the principle that Poland is a part of the Russiansphere of interests. We are fully aware what this is leading to. Theso-called &apos; Polish Committee of Liberation,&apos; set up in Moscow, has been officially recognised by the Soviet Government as the &apos; legal Polish Govern-ment.&apos; This Committee is composed mostly of former Communists andgodless agitators. In those party of Poland which have been freed from theGerman yoke Communist propaganda is already coming into the open. . . .&quot; Every one of us is asking what are we fighting for ? For what ideals ?Is it possible that we are fighting only to satisfy the selfish aims of the Big-Three ? Should this be the case every drop of Polish blood and every Polishlife would have been sacrificed in vain.&quot;Minute by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to Poland.I drew M. Rom, r&apos;s attention yesterday to the article by the Polish Ministerfor Education (Christian Democrat), Mgr. Kaczynski, which appeared in a papercalled S-prawa or Common Cause, which is published in London under the aegis of the Polish section of the &quot; Sword of the Spirit/&apos; and made appropriateremonstrances. M. Romer said that he and the Prime Minister had already pointed out to Mgr. Kaczynski the hopeless ineptitude and impropriety anduntruth of his article. I said this was all very well, but in ordinary circumstances we should expect that a member of the Polish Government who published this sort of thing would be at once called upon to resign. M. Romer said he quite under-stood this, but that M. Mikolajczyk had got a great deal on his hands at themoment and that any alterations in the personnel of the Government would be bound to raise all sorts of connected issues. He had therefore not felt it wise to take extreme measures against Mgr. Kaczynski. but M. Romer led me tounderstand that it w^ould be very improbable that this man would find a placein any reconstructed Polish Government.O. 0&apos;MALLEY.27th September, 1944.
