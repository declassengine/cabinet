3 - o A,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944, /SECRET. Copy No.iS.P. (44) 584.20th October, 1944. &quot;WAR CABINET.TWO DAY-SHIFT WORKING IN FACTORY EMPLOYMENT.Memorandum by Minister of&apos;Labour and National Service.INCREASING attention is being given to the need for a reorganisation of hours of work in factory employment after the war. Many industrialists see greatdifficulty in developing the export trade and otherwise in meeting foreigncompetition unless they can instal up-to-date machinery and plant, involvingconsiderable putlay, with some assurance that they will be able tb run. themachinery oh. a double-shift system, siay for 80 hours a week. I have. already received representations from large employers in such industries as jute, nylonand the soap and chemical industries urging the general adoption of the doubleday-shift system. Also the President of the Board of Trade has. recentlysuggested to the cotton industry that there should be an extension of double-shift.working if the industry is to prepare itself for post-war conditions.2. The general introduction in factory employment of a system of double-shift working of the kind here suggested would conflict with existing legislation;which generally speaking fixes the earliest starting and latest finishing hours for women and young persons over 16 years of age in factories at 7 a.m and 8 p.m.respectively. As the law now stands the Minister of Labour may authorisedouble-shift working for women and young persons over 16 between 6 a.m. and10 p.m., but this adjustment can only be made by special authority for a particularfactory, and except in the case of new factories where the system is to be permanently adopted the system is subject to the Minister being satisfied after a ballot at the factory that the majority of the workpeople consent. If a general or widespread extension of the double-shift system is contemplated, the law willrequire amendment so that the system is not treated as one requiring specialpermission to meet exceptional circumstances at a particular factory. At thesame time the health and welfare of the workers must be safeguarded. A notegiving further details as to the history of the system in this country is annexed.3. The revolutionary change which would result from the widespreadintroduction of the double-shift system is not likely to be made without the riskof considerable friction and industrial disturbance unless it has the support of well-informed opinion among employers and among workpeople and theirorganisations. The proposal has serious implications in its effect oh industrial organisation, on the employment position, on earnings, on the social life of thecommunity, on the welfare of women and young persons, and in relation to therequirements of the new Education Act. Moreover, the attitude of employersgenerally and of organised workers will be an important factor in the situation.4. I am, therefore, strongly of opinion that the adoption of double-shift working calls for detailed examination by a strong and authoritative committeewhich could examine all aspects of the matter, including : (a) the need for changed methods of working in the interests of tnade develop-ment and full employment;(b) the effect of the change on earnings and on the social life and habits of work people;[28432]
(c) the safeguards which. are necessary for the welfare and health of theworkers; and .(d) the operation of the double-shift system in relation to the requirementsof the new Education Act.I accordingly recommend that a committee should be appointed at once to enquire into the adoption of the two day-shift system in manufacturing industry andto report upon its consequences and effects and upon the changes in the existing law and procedure which would be necessary if the system is to be widely adopted.I should presumably have the primary responsibility for setting up thecommittee, but it should be announced as a Government decision, and I would propose to consult the President of the Board of Trade in particular as to theconstitution and terms of reference of the committee.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,20th October, 1944./ANNEX.Two Day-Shift Working by Women and Young Persons over 16 in Factories.The shift systems here in question are similar to those worked by women and young persons over 16 at individual factories in a considerable variety ofindustries since the last war, i.e., turns averaging 8 hours (including a half-hourmeal interval) and usually 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. for the morning shift (6 turns) and2 p.rn. to 10 p.m. for the afternoon shift (5 turns). This gives 82i working hours a week for the machinery and an average of 41^ working hours for the workers.Except in some special cases (e.g., youths over 16 in some iron and steel processes),an employer is not legally entitled to employ women or young persons on such&apos;systems in factories, but they can be specially authorised for a particular factoryby the Minister, subject to the overriding limits of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., and (exceptin the case of new factories where the system is intended to be permanentlyadopted) subject to his being satisfied after a ballot at the factory that themajority of the workpeople concerned consent. A further suggestion has recentlybeen made that, in view of the considerable saving in overheads if the factory doesnot work on Saturday morning, it should be permissible at five-day-week factories to work up to 11 p.m. so as to afford time for 8^-hour (instead of 8-hour) turns andthus 40 (instead of 37^) working hours for individuals and 80 (instead of 75) hours for the plant; and it may be urged that, as against the somewhat later stoppingtime in the evening, there is the advantage to the workers of two whole free daysat the week-end.2. The two day-shift system in question has a history of controversy. Itfirst developed in this country in the last war (when it was authorised under emergency Powers), particularly in india-rubber, margarine and other foods,electric wire and cables, matches, paper and sundry metal industries. In the textile industries its use was then very limited, but subsequently developed to amore substantial extent, particularly in artificial silk and hosiery and in those branches of the cotton and woollen industries which supply the yarns for hosiery,so that by 1935 about 19,000 women and young persons were employed in suchshifts in textile (as compared with about 16,000 in non-textile) works. At the endof the last war it was foreseen that the system might prove very advantageousboth from the economic point of view and as affording relatively short working-hours and, notwithstanding Trade Union opposition, an Act was passed in 1920empowering the Secretary of State to authorise the system for women and youngpersons over 16 in particular cases ;* but the Act was stated to be experimental andwas limited in operation to five years. Subsequently it was, under successive governments and notwithstanding considerable opposition, continued from yearto year by Expiring Laws Continuance Acts until 1936, when the matter was puton a permanent basis by a special Act which empowered the Secretary of State to* The system could not legally be worked under the ordinary provisions of the FactoryActs, which are based on the principle that the permissible working times should be the same forall the women and young persons in the factory, i.e. are designed for single day-shift working.
authorise the system in individual cases on substantially the same lines as before,but subject to a new condition (mentioned above) as to the taking of a ballot exceptin the case of certain new factories. This Act followed a very full inquiry intothe working of the system by a Departmental Committee, who, in their Report(Cmd. 4914), reviewed at some length the advantages and disadvantages of thesystem from the manufacturers&apos; and workers&apos; standpoints. They described thevalue of the system for enabling processes which are essentially women&apos;work&apos; to&apos; be kept level with - those of men, for providing flexibility in the adjustment of plant to output and, in particular, for cases where the cost of plantis high compared with labour costs, whether because plant often has to be changed in view of changes of fashion or because of other reasons, and whereforeign competition has to be faced. They found that the system was much more widely employed abroad than in this country. As&apos; regards health, they concluded&apos;that, in general, the system does not injure the health of the workers and drew attention to&apos; the advantages of the system in enabling shorter hours to be workedand affording greater leisure in the day-time and greater opportunities for freshair and exercise; and, as regards criticisms of the system on the ground that itdislocates family life, they pointed out that it is not unusual, quite apart fromshift systems, for different members of a family to have different working hours and meal-times, and that in areas where shifts have always been the normalmethod of work for men thia is taken as a matter of course.3. Between the passing of the 1936 Act and the outbreak of the present warthe system was authorised in a limited number of further cases (126 in 1937 and165 in 1938), but its use did not become widespread and about half of theauthorisations were only temporary to meet temporary emergencies. During thewar 8-hour shift systems either with only two shifts or with a third (night)shift have been more extensively authorised under, emergency powers but (asin the last war) not to the same extent as the system of two (day and night) shifts.There seem to be various reasons for this, largely peculiar to war conditions. Forinstance, where, to meet war pressure, work for most of the 24 hours is foundnecessary, it is more difficult to find and organise labour, particularly supervisorylabour, for three 8-hour shifts than for two longer shifts. Again, work for a fullnight seems to have been more popular because of dislike of travelling to and from work in the black-out unusually early in the morning or unusually late at nightwhen there are comparatively few people about.
