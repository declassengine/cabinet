A detailed summary of operations is appended.B. Results of Operations.1. German Towns.A large number of German towns were successfully attacked during theperiod. Print No. 1 shows the results of the attack made on Darmstadt on thellth/ 12th September, when the city was almost completely destroyed. Minister,attacked on the 12th September, suffered severe damage in the southern part ofthe town (see Print No. 2), and in a raid the following day on osnabruck almost the entire centre of the town, extending over an area of about 2,000 by 500 yards,was completely burnt out. Heavy damage was also caused in and north of the marshalling yard (see Print No. 3). Stuttgart was very successfully attacked onthe 12th/13th September (see Print No. 4) and widespread destruction was caused. Twenty-two industrial plants in Munchen-Gladbach were destroyed orvery severely damaged on the 19th/20th September (see Print No. 5) and business and residential property in the areas round the main station also suffered heavily.A particularly successful attack was made on Saarbrucken on the5th/6th October (see Print No. 6) and photographs taken the following day showalmost the entire built-up area of the city centre burning fiercely on both sides of the river Saar for over a mile. Print No. 7 shows the very severe damage done to the steelworks of Vereinigte Hiittenwerke Burbacherhutte in the city. print. 8 shows the results of the attack on Bremerhaven on the 18th/19th September,when the Naval equipment depot at -Wesermiinde, the old district of the town,suffered severe damage and all its oil stocks and many thousands of tons of fuel oil were destroyed.Karlsruhe was heavily attacked on the 26th/27th September (see Print No. 9)and Kaiserslautern, attacked the following night, suffered devastation over avery large area (see Print No. 10). Attacks-were also made on Kiel (see print. 11); Neuss, where heavy damage was caused in the marshalling yard anddock area; Bremen, where the old city has now been almost completely gutted;and Dortmund.Prints Nos. 12 and 13 show the results of the attacks on Emden andRusselsheim, mentioned in the previous Summary.2. Enemy Positions and other Military Targets in France and Holland.An outstanding achievement was the breaching of the dyke at Westkapelleon the island of Walcheren by 243 Lancasters on the 3rd October. Prints Nos. 14and 15 show the success of the attack. The area submerged, which by the6th October was about 2 miles wide, includes the previously very strongly heldenemy positions in the east of Westkapelle. On the 7th October the sea-wall anddyke at Flushing were also successfully breached and photographs taken two hours after the attack show the sea pouring in over a width of about 500 yards.Very heavy attacks were made on the strongly defended ports of Boulogne andCalais, and Print No. 16 shoves the concentration achieved in a raid on Le Havreon the 5th September.[28414]Copy No.
3. Targets in Germany.The Dortmund-Ems Canal, which carries all the inland waterborne traffic* between the Ruhr and Central Germany, was successfully breached in an attackon the 23rd/24th September (see Print No. 17). Photographs&quot; taken on the5th October showed that the whole 18-mile stretch from the new aqueduct east of Minister&apos;to the junction with the Ems-Weser Canal east of Rheine was virtually empty and upwards of 110 barges could be seen stranded. The KembsDam on the Rhine just north of Basle was attacked and breached on the7th October by 13 aircraft. Oil plants in the Ruhr were again attacked, andPrint No. 18 -shows the serious damage inflicted at Kamen.4. Naval Targets..An extremely accurate attack was made by 132 aircraft on the U-boats andthe pens at Bergen. Two 500-ton submarines were sunk, three machine-shops were destroyed and two others damaged and the main engine and boiler shops were damaged. The battleship Tirpitz in Kaa Fiord was attacked by 27 Lancastersflying from Yagodnik airfield near Archangel and it is believed that severe damage was inflicted.5. Results of Previous Attacks.Print No. 19 shows the concentration achieved in an attack on the lie deCezembre on the 31st August. Print No. 20, a ground photograph taken afterthe attack on the Renault works in Paris in March 1942, shows the heavy damageinflicted.6. Print No. 21 makes a comparison between the damage caused by bomber command in part of the Moabit district of Berlin with that caused by flyin bombs in an area of the same size in Croydon. This comparison will help to bring home the great extent of the damage in a typical area of Berlin. Similardevastation can be found elsewhere in the city and in many other towns and citiesthroughout Germany.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry,18th October, 1944.APPENDIX.Summary of Operations.aircraft date.
