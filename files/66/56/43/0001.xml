(sS E C R B T-LP. (UU) 59325TH OCTOBER,  1 9AACOPY WO.WAR CABINECIVIL AVJATION - CHICAGO conference memorandum by the Mi nistor for Civil Avi at ionTwo further points have arisen upon which I should like the approval of the War Cabinet.1 *    The right of innocent passageI think it is clearly in the    interest of theBritish Empire that there should be the right of innocent   1passage, i.e.  to fly over a foreign country.        Empire air routes must traverse a large number of- countries.      In thepast foreign countries have used their sovereign rights in the air to hold up long range air transport to ransom.I propose,  therefore, at the Chicago Conference,  to try toget all countries while maintaining the sovereignty, of theirown territorial air space, to agree to the right of innocent passage.      This,  of course, would not in any wayinvolve the concession of any right to land which must bethe subject of a comprehensive convention or bilateral agreement.2.    ,unericqn Leased Air Bases in the West IndiesThe United States Government may ask that theseair bases shall be available for American Civil Air Lines&apos;.They would no doubt offer that they should be equallyavailable to any British or Empire Lines.        These air bases were leased for military purposes and cannot beused for civil purposes without the consent of H.M.Government.      If a satisfactory comprehensive convention is agreed this issue will not arise.      If, however, weare driven back on bilateral negotiations, then in myopinion, no concession should be made but I should statethat this question,  in, common with other landing facilities.,should be dealt with in the bilateral negotiations,whichmust follow at a later date.S.^iel House,25th October,  19kix.
