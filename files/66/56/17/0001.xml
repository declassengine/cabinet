.&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJGOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.TOP secret copy No.W.P. (44) 567.llth October, 1944.WAR CABINET.&quot; CROSSBOW &quot;-PUBLICATION IN THE PRESS OE MAPS SHOWINGTHE FALL OF FLYING BOMBS.AT the Meeting of the War Cabinet on the 9th October, 1944 (W.M. (44)134th Conclusions, Minute 3), we were invited to consider whether publication in the Press of further maps of sections of the London Region showing the failof flying bombs should be permitted.2. In our view such publication is open to serious objection for the following reasons : (i) The publication of a plot of the fall of flying bombs in a small partof the London area will have given the Germans some information of value to them, namely, the density of the pattern at a certain meandistance from their point of aim.(ii) This information becomes more and more valuable as the area to whichit applies is increased. In fact, if each borough is free to publishits own pattern, the Germans will receive a complete plot. This isdoubtless what they most require, since it will give them completedata not only as to the overall accuracy of the weapon but as to theposition of the M.P.I. in relation to the point of aim. Any deductionsdrawn from a study of fall of shot on the London area will be applied in attacks against other target areas.(iii) The Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force, has statedthat :-(iv) We know that flying bomb launching sites are being constructed in the ruhr area. If the Germans concentrated flying bombs againstAntwerp, they might obtain substantial results in the relatively large area covered by the port and the surrounding districts where a largenumber of dumps would exist.3. We are therefore of the opinion that any further publication of informa-tion giving accurate data as to the fall of flying bombs during the recent offensive against London should be prohibited.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.V.1 and V.2 are now a possible threat against the allied expeditionary Force.&quot;(Signed)ANDREW CUNNINGHAM.D. C.
