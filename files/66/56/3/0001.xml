(44) COPY NO. \Ui - ii October,  1944.W--R cabinet^KK PRODUCTION ?ROGRaML&amp;rote by the ^iini::-t-:.J&apos; ji Production.At their meeting on 29th September,  1944 (W.M.(44) 129thConclusions, minute 2),  the War Cabinet discussed, further the-effect on the production of munitions of assuming thr-t the warwith Germany would .not continue after the 31st December,  I9i4.i1.I then pointed out thet, &quot;broadly speaking,  owing to theamount of stores accumulated and in transit,   the reductions which I had proposed and the War Cabinet had approved wouldenable  our forces to continue without any appreciable reductionin their striking power until the end of March 1945-The Prime Minister thought that in the particular case of tanks further enquiry was needed, and I was asked to submit amemorandum setting out the stocks of tanks on hand and therates of production.I now circulate a summary of the position, which has beenprepared by the Secretary of State for v/ar in agreement with theMinister of Supply.       It will be seen thet they recommend thattank production should be planned on the definite assumption thetthe war will continue until the 31st March,  1943 (hypothesis Cof the note attached).If the tank programme were to be framed with the strictestpossible regard for economy,  there would no doubt be little riskin reducing production by the full amount hitherto proposed(Hypothesis B);    particularly since there are a-t-the present time*500 Sherman tanks forming part of the 1944 assignments from theU. S. a.  w hie h h a v e n o t been all oc a ted.On the other hand the extra production involved If HypothesisC is adopted is small (450 tanks).    , This would,  moreover,  have theadvantage of giving us 430 of the latest type of tank.This being so, I consider that we should adopt the recommenda-tion of the War Office and the Ministry of Supply and plan our production on the assumption that the war against Germany willcontinue until 31st March,  1945 (Hypothesis 0).O.L.Ministry of Production,C  Or. at George St.,  SVW. 1.4th October, 1944.

SUMMARY 0? TANK PROVISION ?ROGRAI-.:;. S,   1943-1.       SERVICEABLE STOCK,   51 DEJEkBER,  19kk.On the assumption that the British Tank Programme continueswith no considerable reduction until the end of 13Uk, hut that(further assignments of American tanks made during the last twoninths of the year are not effective during the year, the esti-mated stock of medium tanks available on&apos; 31 December, 19kk,  can be  assumed to be:-Churchiil:Cromwell/Comet:Sherman:TOTAL:  15,000This figure makes allowance for the- wastage in tanks thatmay be expected to take place between now and the end of the year,n the assumption that the war against Germany continues unabated.&apos;2.       TANK REQUIRE:.-:..:-:!^,   1945-Full credit can be taken for this stock as long as  the deployment of armoured formations remains unchanged as it may beexpected to do for the duration of the war against Germany.On the other hand, a proportion varying by types must be written down for purposes   of a new deployment  of armour against japan.    This is necessary since only those tanks in the early part of their life can reasonably be considered fit to transfer from the European theatre to a campaign in the Ear East thatmay be expected to last from one year to eighteen months.On these assumptions,  our requirements of tanks in 19k5,after taking credit for stock,  are given below, based on&apos;three alternative hypotheses:-Hypothesis  Va.1The war with Germany continuing until 31st December,19h.5:-Churchlll/A. 2+3: 2,250Cromwell/Comet/A.hi: ) 9,oOOSherman: )Hypothesis  &apos;B&apos;The war with Germany ending by 31st December, 19kh:-(y Churchill/A.2+3: 700, (new heavy type.)Cromwell/Comet/A.2+1:    1, 200 (required to re-equip(certain formations(now equipped with(Sherman)Sherman: 1,7001, 6501,70011,650TO?

InfantryThe proposed reduction in the Churchill programme shouldbe introduced on 1st April,  1945*  instead of on 1st January,1945.      The effect of this postponement would be to produce290 new tanks and 240 row irked vehicles during the first quarter instead of the 210 new and 90 reworked tanks nowplanned.The programme for the whole year would then be 1,430 new and reworked,  as compared with 1,200.(h) Cruiser Tanks.The additional 1,250 Cruiser Tanks required by this. &quot;decision can be met either by a similar postponement of theproposed reduced programme from 1st January, 1945, until 1st April,  1945, which would give an increase of 220 Cromwell/Comet in the first quarter and an increase in provision fromi o/America

America from 1,700 to 2,730.      Alternatively, the wholeincrease might, be met from U.S.A. &quot;by provision of some,950 tanks, but this is not desirable as we are not certain that we shall get the latest tu- pes, and there -isa tendency to allocate us secondhand vehicles withoutspares.In either case,  it should be noted that the provisionrequired from America is less than the unassigned.balanceof our 13hh A.S.?.  and that, therefore,  no new provision will have to be negotiated.rego;:: jendationJ,Provision under Hypothesis   &apos;C&apos;,  i.e.:-Churchill/a.
