(44) 561.9th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.IN THE MAQUIS.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.I attach a report received from Squadron-Leader F. C. Griffiths last year,which for various reasons I did not circulate to my colleagues at the time. It is,however, such good reading that I think it would be a pity if it were buried inour files. It also has a political bearing now, as it illustrates the feelings of theFrench people for the British, and particularly for the R.A.F., during the yearsof eclipse.S:Ministry of Economic Warfare, W. 1,Sth October, 1944,[28290]B

Rear Gunner.Sergeant Davies. 112, Flight Engineer.(This report is written by Squadron-Leader Griffiths at the British Consulate,Geneva, in September 1943.)At 2140 hours on the 14th August, 1943, I took off from&apos; R.A.F., Tempsford,in Halifax &quot; 0 &quot; for Orange with crew as detailed above and a load consistingof 15 Containers and 4 large packages, the latter being carried inside the aircraftmounted on launching rollers.2. I flew via Reading and Tangmere and started off across the Channel atNautical Twilight and at a height of 700 feet. Before taking off I had been warned that my route would be similar to Main Force, who were that nightraiding Milan. We crossed the French coast in thick cloud at 7,000 feet in theneighbourhood of Coburg. This cloud cover, together with rain, persisted all theway to Blois. which we hit off dead on track at 1,000 feet. So far, the navigationwas of a very high order. We carried on to Nevers, and at this point I had mydoubts as to whether it was worth going on, as there was still a layer of stratuscloud at 4,000 feet and the land ahead of us was rising rapidly. We saw oneof the boys in Main Force getting a packet at Le Creusot at about 10,000 feet.3. The cloud was breaking rapidly now and we were able to slip over the mountains into the Rhone valley with several hundred feet to spare. By the time we reached Lake Annecy the cloud had dispersed altogether&apos; and weather conditions were ideal for the operation.4. It was 0100 hours D.B.S.T., the 15th August, when we first started to look for the reception. I flew fairly low in some pretty sticky country for tenminutes but without seeing anything. We decided to cover up our activities bynickelling the town of Annecy and, at the same time, to make a run due northalong the railway and map-reacl ourselves right up&apos;to the dropping-point we hadbeen given. If we saw nothing, we were going to push straight off home again.Sergeant Davies, Flight Engineer, went aft to assist Sergeant Maden indistributing the newspapers. I turned in the middle of Lake Annecy and randue north, flying over the town at a height of 200 feet. I picked up the railway and started to follow it. I had hardly become clear of the built-up area when theaircraft started to swing to port, and I noticed the colour of the exhaust flamesof the outer port motor change to white and die out altogether. I called up the flight Engineer, but apparently he had not got his head set plugged in. Itrimmed the aircraft, put the P.O. airscrew into Fully Course, gave full throttleon the other three engines and full revs. I opened the bomb doors and ordered the bomb aimer to prepare to jettison. I had hoped to jettison well away fromthe town and near our point of reception. After a short while I formed theopinion that I might not even have to jettison, as the aircraft was performingquite reasonably and gaining a little height. I was still frantically yelling forthe Flight Engineer to contact me. I did not wish to feather the dead engine, asI was sure it was petrol trouble and not the usual glycol leak, owing to the colourof the exhaust flames and also to the fact that the engine was revving quitemerrily. Had the trouble been the usual glycol leak, the motor would have seizedup. My hopes of getting away with it were soon dashed to the ground, as theport inner motor then started to give off white flames and a truly violent swingdeveloped to port. I ordered the bomb aimer to jettison, which he did, and thedespatcher. who fortunately had been plugged in the whole time, also heard theorder and jettisoned the packages.
5. Things were happening far quicker than it takes to read, but at thispoint the Flight Engineer called me up and said something to the effect that he must change over to Nos. 1 and 3 tanks. I had hoped that the petrol would surgethrough in time to give me power to get out of our difficulties. &quot; O &quot; for Orangewas continuing to lose height in a permanent left-hand turn at an air speed of110 m.p.h. I ordered the crew to their crash stations. The Navigator and wireless Operator went aft like greased lightning, but the Bombardier was delayed through having trouble jettisoning the hatch above my head. I considerthat his devotion to duty during those last terrible moments was the reason why Iwas saved.6. Nothing is so completely useless as a Halifax with two dead motors onthe same wing in the bottom of an Alpine Valley in the middle of the night. Ican distinctly remember the Flight Engineer calling out in a perfectly cheerfulvoice : &quot; O.K., Skipper. you&apos;re on 1 and 3 tanks now &quot;; and another call fromMaden : &quot; Despatcher at Crash Stations.&quot; I just had time to snap my shoulder-strap tensioning lever into &apos;&apos; Taut&apos;&apos; and we touched down on some trees quitegently at 90 m.p.h. indicated. I still had plenty of elevator control and full power on the starboard motors till the very last second. The port wing took the shockfirst.   We ran a short distance and then we hit the first house.7. When I became conscious again I was hanging in my straps and I soonbecame aware that there was a terrible fire raging behind me. I was so dazedand in such terrible fear of burning (it was getting dreadfully hot) that I madetwo or three panic attempts to get out of my seat with the straps still on. Finally,I realised what was holding me in my seat and pulled out the pin. I seemed to fall a hell of a distance and I hit the ground with such a force that my right armbroke. I think I became conscious again, for I came to lying under the fire andin a complete panic. I scrambled to my feet and started to run away. After afew yards I was grabbed by two men who spoke excitedly in, I think, Italian. Iwas bleeding somewhat profusely from various places and they tried to take offmy parachute harness. I could tell by the way they were shaping that they didn&apos;tknow much about parachutes, so I released the Quick B,elease Box nryself with myleft hand. They took off my harness and &apos;&apos; Mae West&apos;&apos; and started to march meover to a military-looking lorry which-had just arrived. They didn&apos;t handle mein a particularly friendly manner, but I was still only semi-conscious and we were very near the burning aircraft.8. Suddenly there was a terrific explosion as one of the petrol tanks wentup. Sheets of flame and rubbish went over my head and the two &quot; Ities &quot; yelledsomething about bombs and ran. In thinking of their own skins they forgotabout me entirely, and I turned to the right and ran as hard as I could not somuch to run away from the &quot; Ities &quot; as to get away from the fire. (That fire willhaunt me for the rest of my life. We still had 1,500 gallons left when we crashed.)I don&apos;t think I got very far before I passed out. This time I became consciousagain lying in a ditch covered with dirt and earth and still only about 200 yardsaway from the burning aircraft. There was a woman sitting on the bank aboveme crying her heart out. She was very old and I can remember her face veryclearly, as it showed up well in the light of the fire. She didn&apos;t know I was lyingat her feet, and she didn&apos;t take the slightest notice of me when I got up.9. I should explain here that it was a very hot night when we left Englandand, in consequence, I was not wearing my battle-dress tunic. I had left ithanging up near the rest bunks with the pockets full of pears which I had intendeddistributing to the crew as we flew home. Instead of a service shirt, I waswearing an extraordinary affair of dark blue with white horizontal stripes. Ialways wore this on troops., as I considered I could become a civilian in a matter ofseconds by discarding my tunic. The &apos;&apos; Ities &apos;&apos; had already removed my parachuteharness and &quot; Mae West,&quot; so as I walked up the road I think I was taken for aFrenchman. As my back was to the fire, I don&apos;t think the crowd could see the blood on my face in any case, they were engrossed in watching the burning-aircraft and the three houses, which were now also well alight.10. I started to walk up the village street. (It subsequently transpired thatI had landed on the village of Meythet, some 3 or 4 kilom. west of Annecy.) Afterquite a short distance I saw a youth on a bicycle coming towards me. He looked at me very closely as he passed, stopped immediately and chased after me. i could see right away that he was friendly. He said in a hushed whisper in french : &quot; You are English,&quot; to which I replied : &quot; Yes; where are the Boche ? &quot;He said : &quot;There aren&apos;t any round here. They are all Italians.&quot; I told him[28290] b 2
that I was going to try and get to Spain, and turned away to start up the road&apos; again. He grabbed my arm and said : &quot; No, no, I will hide you; get on the bike.&quot;I sat across the cross-bar side-saddle and he mounted behind. Then I found that both my arms were useless. I could see that my right wrist was broken and I had such a pain in my left shoulder that I couldn&apos;t&apos;t hang on to the handlebars properly.I had to lie forward on the handlebars with a small nut drilling a hole in mychest all the time. When we came to a steep bit of hill my helper yelled out toanother lad who was on his way down to the crash to come and give a push. this second laddie tagged on behind and pushed and we made pretty good headway.Fortunately, we didn&apos;t have far to go. We stopped at a house on the right andwent upstairs to the kitchen. There was quite a crowd in the kitchen and shriekswent up from the women when they saw me. I must have looked a lot worse than   felt.11. I was given a glass of, I think, Kirsch. Wliatever it was. it was darngood and it brought me round completely. I can speak only very little Frenchmyself, but during the next half hour I was conversing continuously and it wassurprising how they understood me. First of all they said that they had seen mycompanions jump out with their parachutes. It dawned on me that what theyhad seen were the jettisoned containers, so I told them that all my crew were inthe aircraft when it crashed, and that what they had seen were fifteen parachuteswith arms for the French. I was going to mention that there were also fourpackages, but before I could put it into French half the room suddenly emptied.I think they thought that they&apos;d better get the containers before the Italians! !The lad with the long hair who had originally put me on the bicycle told me thathe belonged to the Maquis, and that he sent a message to Headquarters asking them to come for me in a lorry. I thought that all this sounded a bit high-handed, and that perhaps I was still delirious, but then at that time I didn&apos;t know the Maquis.12. While we were conversing the lady of the house was bathing my variousabrasions ,and stopping the bleeding as best she could. I shall always renfemberthe expression &quot;of intense patriotism&quot; on the faces of these good people. I found out afterwards that it was easy to tell merely by intuition the French whowere pro-ally and the French who weren&apos;t so keen. Immediately a pro-allyFrenchman knew that I was an English aviator a glow7 of intense patriotism wouldspread over his face and he would squeeze my arm.   (Always the bad arm !)13. The lad with the Ion2; hair told me that he knew I was English when he saw me walking up the road because of my shoes. This rather disappointed mebecause I always wore shoes instead of flying boots on troops. as (a) flying boots were so terribly conspicuous and (b) by wearing my best and newest shoes I had hopedthat they wroulcl some day stand up to a trek across Europe and a climb over thePyrenees. (My wife will bear me out that for months I had had minor night-mares, waking up in the night in a sweat having dreamt that I was being huntedand that Germans were after me.) However, the remark of the lad with the longhair made me look at the footwear of the folks in the room and they just had&apos;tany to speak of. All their shoes seemed home-made, some like clogs and somemade of rope. There wasn&apos;t&apos;t a decent pair of shoes amongst them, and it was thesame throughout the whole of Haute Savoie.14. I noticed the time on my watch while my head was being bathed. It was0130 hours. I couldn&apos;t&apos;t help thinking that before taking off we had been somewhatfoxed by the fact that the time changed to-night to Single British Summer Time,and we had been bemoaning the fact that as we should be flying all night weshould not get our extra hour in bed in the morning. The little things that oneworries about when you&apos;re not in trouble! I didn&apos;t give a damn if I had&apos;t apossession in the whole world. I was alive and I had a wife and child in Englandwhom I might one day see again. I. confided this fact to the folks in the roomand for some reason the women started weeping.15. &apos; One of the men apologised to me for France making the Armistice withGermany, and then he said &quot; but we had Laval whereas you had Churchill, so what could we do?&quot;16. They produced a civvy pair of trousers for me as my battle-bags were too obvious, and on emptying the pockets of the battle-bags they were overjoyedto find my -32 Colt Repeater. They noticed it had &quot; Property of the UnitedStates &quot; written on the side of it. t started to explain the Primary Principlesof &quot; Lease-Lend,&quot; but my French wasn&apos;t&apos;t up to it and I had -to give it up.   As I
had not been wearing my tunic I had put al! the &quot;emergencies &quot; in my trouserpockets. These consisted of the Escape Kit Escape knife with wire cutters,Purse of Dutch, Belgian and French money, a tin of Orange Juice and the Colt.I had to explain the use of all these articles in detad to the crowd. They were particularly intrigued with the Escape Kit and the Compass and Maps out of thepurse. By this time the effects of the Kirseh were starting to wear off and 1 knewI was going to pass out. This time when I came to I thought we were playingthat game in the mess when we jump on each other&apos;s backs and I couldn&apos;t&apos;t under-stand why people were talking a foreign language. Finally the linoleum started to come properly into focus, and I became fully conscious to hnd a Frenchmanholding my head between my knees. Another glass of Kirsch and I was fullyrecovered.17. The noise of desultory firing could be heard from down the street andI went to the window with the others. I was surprised to see how close wre wereto &quot; O &quot; Orange. The fire was only about 400 yards down the road. I  remarked that I thought the firing was caused by the bullets in the machine-gun magazineexploding, and then we heard the staccato rattle of ordinary machine-gun fire. 1learnt on the next day that the ammunition in the aircraft had in fact startedexploding with the heat, but that the Italians had thought that one of the gunnersin the midst of the inferno had opened fire on them. In reply to which they hadopened up with  one of their machine-guns and succeeded in wounding six of theirown men who were on the other side of the fire.18. I donned my gent&apos;s natty civil suiting which consisted of a pair ofpin-striped trousers, a blue coat and a cap. I kept my shoes on as I was apparently to travel in a lorry and no one wrould notice them. At 0100 hours(three-quarters of an hour after crashing) a lorry drew up outside and a manburst into the room brandishing a revolver. He took my Colt, cocked it and stuckit in my right hand inside breast pocket where I could just get at it. We wentdowmstairs immediately. I didn&apos;t even have time&apos;to thank the folks for whatthey&apos;d done for me and I had intended giving them some of the 1,000 francswhich I had on me to pay for the clothes.19. ! I got into the front of the lorry and just had time to notice that the back was full of men armed with revolvers and Sten guns. Seeing the old Stengun made me feel quite at home. We backed into the road and then the motorstalled ! The driver ground away on the self-starter but the bitch would&apos;nt fire.The light from the burning crash was reflected through the rear cab windowron to the windscreen. I felt sure the Italians would get us and what wrere a fewrSten guns compared with a pukka machine gun. However, just as the starterAvas on its last gasp she fired and we shot up the road at the rate of knots. Wesoon forked left on to a very secondary road, switched off the lights and thedriver heaved a sigh of relief. So did I. It was very bright moonlight and an extremely mountainous road. The speed we drove at was just fantastic. I&apos;vealways admired French drivers but this laddie was simply amazing. Heobviously knew the road very well.20. We drove for about 4 or 5 miles and then, after switching off the engine,coasted downhill into a valley. We stopped some 200 yards short of whatappeared to be a large farm. The driver explained that this was one of theMaquis hide-outs and that I should stay here, but before approaching some of themen would go forward and make sure that, the coast was clear. When thereconnaisssance party returned we carried on down to the buildings and ran thelorry into a large implement shed. I was led to the back door and taken straightupstairs.21., I was taken into a room in which bowds, first-aid kit, &amp;c, were laid out.Here a great crowd gathered round whilst a young Maquis who had probably been a medical student started to clean my wounds up a bit more. They had not had time to finish the&apos;job at the first house. A glass of wine enabled me to pullmyself together and tell my whole story over once more. These were a completelydifferent set of people from those I met in the first house. All the men woreuniform consisting of shorts and shirts of khaki similar to our overseas workingdress with the Croix. cie Lorraine on the left breast pocket and a silver star onthe left sleeve. The women folk, of whom there were three in number, wore verysmall brass brooches in the form of the Croix de Lorraine.22. As an added measure of precaution I shall, where necessary, give falsenames of persons and places from this point onwards.
23. The place at which I had arrived was the Coq d&apos;Or, a farm-cum-publichouse on a busy main road. We had approached it by a little-used road over the mountains. The Officer in Charge was a young Frenchman of 22 and his sectionwas a portion of the Secret Army. They were known as mobilised Maquis and during the day they hid in this&quot; house, going out at night to carry out theirallotted tasks of sabotage and &quot;bumping off of collaborators.&quot; Life was verymuch like it was in Ireland during the time of the &quot; Trouble.&quot; Each was armed with a revolver and they had three Sten guns besides a few hand-grenades. TheOfficer in Charge, &quot; Robin Hood,&quot; could speak excellent English, as he had beenin England for some time.24. The Coq d&apos;Or was run by Jean and Poppy, both of whom were between35 and 40 years old. These two kept the Merry Men hidden upstairs during theday. Poppy did all the cooking and served in the bar. It was a very popularplace of call for Italians. Gendarmes, the odd German and a few Gestapo men.If only these customers had realised as they used to sit drinking below that abovetheir heads were nine desperate men with sufficient arms and explosives to starta small war ! There was also another girl called the Blonde, who was, I think,engaged, bethrothed. or married to Robin Hood. She carried a long dagger withwhich to look after herself and Poppy had a tiny -22 six-chambered revolver.25. While they were bandaging up my head everyone suddenly stoppedtalking and listened intently. I thought the Italians were coming, but everyonelooked so frightfully pleased about something that I couldn&apos;t&apos;t understand whatwas going on. Then it dawned on me. The noise we heard was Main Force comingback from Milan and everyone had a drink on the strength of it. They told me thatthey always sat up when Bomber Command went over and drank to the boys&apos;good fortune. I only wish the boys up aloft could know of the joy they bring to french people as they go over. I myself felt a bit depressed. Main Force wouldbe home in two hours and here was I stuck in France and, even with the best ofgood fortune, not a hope of seeing England for months.26: The effects of my last glass of wine started to wear off and I was soonfeeling violently sick and then started to faint. I must have been &quot; out &quot; quite a while this time as they all seemed rather concerned when I came to. When Iwas sick I brought up some blood and they thought I was hurt internally.Actually. I think the blood came from the inside of my mouth, which had beenpretty well chewed-up by my teeth. The dressings were finished and I was put tobed. How glad I was to get to bed and hear the reassurance from Robin Hoodthat I was perfectly safe here. He had also sent one of his men back to the crashto find out about my crew. This news came in after awhile. They had got twodead bodies out of the aircraft and several bodies of civilians out of the houses.He thought that four of my crew had got away. I only wish he had been right.I said I was sorry for killing the French civilians, and he said &quot; Oh ! that&apos;s allright, you did a good job. You killed two Italian families and the family of aGerman baker.   No French people were hurt! &quot;27. One of the Merry Men sat up with me all night. I ve never seen atougher, fitter-looking bunch of men in all my life and yet they were as gentle as any woman when it came to nursing. I had noticed how well their First-Aid kitwas applied, and apparently they use it quite a good deal. In the previousSeptember they had had a battle royal with the Italians, in which they had only two men killed, compared with the Italians 57, and six of their wounded taken prisoner, whom they were unable to get away.28. Next morning Poppy brought me an enormous bowl of coffee for break-fast. It was wonderful coffee. Why can&apos;t Englishwomen make coffee like that?I couldn&apos;t&apos;t eat anything. I reckon I was suffering from shock and also still hadwind up, and I just can&apos;t eat when I have wind up.29. Robin Hood came to see me after breakfast. He was sending in areport to his headquarters about the crash and sending out a man to see if hecould locate the remainder of my crew whom they thought had escaped. He told me the doctor would come later and set my arm and that this doctor, being aMaquis agent, would take a report from me to the Consulate in Geneva, about30 miles away. The Consulate would be able to send a W/T message to Englandand my next-of-kin would be informed that I was still alive and in security.This was indeed heartening news.30. In case the Italians had placed any stool pigeons in the district topretend that they were escaped members of my crew we prepared a list of
7&apos;3 ^questions to be put to any alleged escapee in order that he could&apos;prove himselfgenuine. I gave Robin Hood the names, Christian names and nicknames of allthe crew and told him the type and colour of the dog which I had at home andwhich was well known and somewhat of a joke with the rest of the Squadron.Any alleged escapee would on question have to prove himself genuine by givingthe above information.31. The doctor arrived about 10 o&apos;clock and proceeded to clean me up a bitmore. The odd cuts and abrasions were pretty painful in their reaction to the peculiar red antiseptic which is so popular in France, but the real fun came whenhe started to set my arm without any anaesthetic. Two strong Maquis held medown and the job was soon over. He lashed the arm to three pieces of margarinebox and told me to keep it lashed up for 30 days. He made a pretty good job ofit. for when I got to Switzerland I had it x-rayed and it was a practicallyperfect join.32. All morning I had a stream of visitors. Apart from the Merry Men,who each in turn slipped into the room to show me his revolver (how they lovedtheir revolvers), there were numerous visitors from outside. All of them were members of the Maquis and helping in some way. They were very thrilled with my arrival and, despite the tragic ending to our mission, it had raised the morale of the district to know that we had&apos;t forgotten about them in England. Minewas the first shipment of arms which they had had for four months.33. At mid-day Robin Hood came in with the news that, as far as he could find out, all my crew had been killed. Five instantaneously and one had got awaybut had been captured and died ten minutes after admission into Annecy hospital.I think this was Maden, as his helmet had been found some way from the crashand^ the people who found it were going to keep it until after the war. He also told me that the Italians were carrying out a systematic search for me. Thevwere using dogs on leads and the system was to surround a wood, make the dogsbark and then fire a few rounds into the wood. When no one broke cover theywould move on to the next wood and carry out the same procedure. It remindedme of a pack of hounds drawing cover. Shortly afterwards I heard the soundof firing getting closer and closer and I was in an absolute blue funk. Robin Hoodtried to alleviate my fear by assuring me that he would see that I was not takenalive. This wasn&apos;t&apos;t very reassuring but it was a slight misunderstanding due tohis not having spoken English for so long. What he meant to say was : &quot; Flaveno fear. They will not take you while one of us is alive.&quot; And he meant it, too.As four of the Merry Men were condemned to death anyhowr, they meant to makea fight of it to the finish. My Colt was under my pillow, but I doubted whether should ever have been able to fire it. In any case I didn&apos;t think my left shoulderwould stand up to the recoil. When I got to Switzerland I found it was fractured.For the first 48 hours at the Coq d&apos;Or I was in a very low state of morale. Ourown watchdog, which was a big black Labrador, used to put the fear of God intome when it barked. It had absorbed from its master, Jean, a fear of Italians,Gendarmes and the Gestapo just as a child will absorb fear of certain thingsfrom its mother. I noticed this at all the places I stayed. The clogs were so usedto seeing certain members of the family take cover as soon as any of the enemy were around that they too became frightened and barked. It was a very goodthing in a way as it gave more warning with less suspicion than a human sentry.Another warning system which was in operation at the Coq d&apos;Or was the callingof an imaginary cat. If someone came into the bar below who was nottrustworthy, whoever was serving would go to the door and call &quot;Polly,&quot;&quot;Polly,&quot; &quot;Polly,&quot; whereupon the Merry Men would stop playing cards, grabtheir guns and lie down on the beds, remaining absolutely still until the &quot; AllClear &quot; went.34. It got pretty hot after midday and the sounds of firing died down.Patrols of Italians still kept whizzing past in cars and lorries, but it was apparently too warm for them to go on scrambling up the mountainside. AfterEngland it seemed terribly hot and although I couldn&apos;t&apos;t eat anything I wasdrinking a gi-eat deal. Unfortunately I wasn&apos;t&apos;t used to drinking wine with a drop of water, which is the usual French custom, and I began to get quite fuzzyas the afternoon wore on. We had to lie dead quiet all afternoon as several oftlie enemy hunting for me were slaking their thirst in the bar below.35. I was in a very pleasant room facing south with a view of Mont Blanc,I think, in the distance.   The window was covered with netting and by sitting
up in bed i could just see what was going on outside. i soon got tired of lookingthrough the window as it gave me an inferiority complex seeing the enemy going-past or drinking outside the bar below. There was a wireless-set by the bedand at each hour one of the Merry Men came in and kept a listening watch ontransmissions from England. He had some sort of code which he kept consulting,but I didn&apos;t want to enquire too deeply into what was going on. At one time hegot the news in English and I heard that our bombers were out over Milan last night and &quot; One of our aircraft is missing.&quot; i wondered if it referred to meor whether it was one of the boys in Main Force. We had to listen to the radio&quot;with the volume turned down in case it should be heard outside the window.36. I was keen to contact the man for whom I was bringing my load ofarms. I had shown Robin Hood the position of the dropping point I had beengiven on a Michelin map wdiich he had produced. The dropping point was only about 5 miles away from us, but discreet enquiries had failed to gather any information. As he explained to me, there were at least five different secretsocieties the Committee of Resistance, the Patriotic Committee, the Secret Armyand two others. It wasn&apos;t&apos;t till a fortnight later when I was in Switzerland thatI actually met the man for whom I was bringing the load.37. I showed Robin Hood on the map the place at which I jettisoned. he proposed going out with a party that night and seeing what he could find. soon after dark he set off, leaving three men to guard me. I dropped into, a doze andaw^oke soon after midnight to find a terrific commotion going on. I thought theItalians had come for me. All the Merry Men were dashing around&apos; with Stenguns and manning the wnndowrs. Soon they were all in position and dead quietreigned. The blonde was on duty at my window. Robin Hood came in very muchout of breath and told me that they had gone to the place where I had jettisonedand marked on the map but that the area. was guarded by Italians. They hadnearly been caught but had got awray without having to bump any of them off.Then&apos; they heard from a friend that some of the Gendarmes had got part of myload at the police station. They clashed into the police station, held the Gendarmesup and forced them to give up ten Sten guns. These they put into sacks (therewere only three of them in the raiding party) and then they heat it on bicycles,hotly pursued by the Gendarmes. They thought that they had thrown theGendarmes off the scent but in case of a surprise attack they were going to manthe defences all night. I must say that anyone attacking the Coq d&apos;Or that nightw^ould have got a mild surprise as there was a man or woman at each windowwith a Sten gun. We now had thirteen (one u/s with the barrel missing), arevolver and a few hand-grenades. Thank goodness no attack developed. I justlay and sweated all night long.38. Next day, Monday, was a comparatively quiet day. They told me that my crew, were going to be buried with Military Honours at 1000 hours the next morning and that they were going to lie in state that evening. The townsfolkwere to be permitted to file past the coffins and bring flowers. I felt prettydepressed all day long and I still couldn&apos;t&apos;t eat. My thirst was just as bad, but I hadtaken to drinking water entirely on discovering that the water was considered safearound here. Things seemed too quiet somehow. All day long we had to keepquiet as there Avas always a Gendarme drinking in the bar and at one time aplain-clothes Gestapo man. My nerves were going to pieces fast. In the after-noon I looked out of the window and saw a Gendarme standing by a car outsidethe bar. He was evidently waiting while his superiors were having a drink inside.He must have stood there about a quarter of an hour and I was in such a low stateof morale by this time that I felt like leaning out of the window and saying&quot; O.K. Til come quiet.&quot; After all, 1 had got out of the most terrific crash aliveand why the hell should I risk getting shot now. If I gave myself up now Iwould have a guarantee that I&apos;d come out of this war aiive. There were two things that held me back. The first was the fact that I was in living fear ofinterrogation at Dulag Luft. My predecessor, Squadron Leader Robinson, had had a nineteen-hour interrogation there. The other thing was that all the people who were&quot; helping me would get shot or have to take to the mountains. ThankGod I resisted the temptation, and writing about it now when I am perfectlysafe makes it all seem damn silly. I&apos;m perfectly convinced that if escapees canonly resist 48 hours in enemy territory they will find the rest of the escapecomparatively easy and uneventful.39. Soon after dark Robin Hood and a man whom I was to know later asNicko came into my room and sat down quietly on the bed. Robin Hood said :&quot; This man was in a bar in Annecy a short while ago and a Gendarme said to
him &apos; If I were you I should move your friend. The Italians know where neis now and they are coming for him at 10 o&apos;clock to-night.&apos; That gives us halfan hour to get out. 1&apos;11 come and dress you in a few minutes, then we shall eatand start off up the mountain at ten to ten.&quot; I told him that I was quite capableof walking at least 10 miles, and he said that we werenT going very far-only a1,000 metres. What he didn&apos;t explain was that we were going a 1,000 metresvertically!40. I was somewhat perturbed at the narrow margin we were allowingbetween our departure and the arrival of the &quot; Ities,&quot; and remarked on this fact.They told me not to worry as the Italians were always late! Meanwhile, thehouse was like a beehive. The Maquis were busy packing rucksacs and eatingat the same time great chunks of black bread and cheese. I had such wind upI couldn&apos;t&apos;t touch a darn thing. I was dressed in yet another civil suiting some-what better fitting than the last. I suggested that I should be allowed to pay for it, but they said it had been in a second-hand clothes shop of a collaboratorwhom they had recently bumped off, and to conclude the operation they had helpedthemselves to his stock. We started to climb up the mountain at the back ofCoq d&apos;Or at a few minutes to ten, scrcimbling upwards amongst nut bushes. Someof the Maquis stayed behind as a rear-guard hiding in cunningly concealedfunk-holes which looked down on the Coq d&apos;Or at the bottom of the valley. Inoticed that they had a very good field of fire, and if they wanted to retreat itwas very easy to get away in the &quot; underground passages &quot; of the nut bushes.These underground passages ran all over the hillside. It was possible to travelall over the mountainside without being seen and the Italians were afraid toenter into the scrub as it was so easy to surprise them and bump them off. Thisscrub in Corsica is called &quot; Maquis,&quot; and hence the manner in which the Maquisgot^their name.41. I-had a &quot; bedroom &quot; allotted me which had been cut out of the bushes.It had wire netting stretched between four bushes and covered with hay. this made a marvellous bed and that night, for the first time, I slept well. &quot; One ofthe contributing factors was the feeling of safety. In the maquis I knew i could run for it, but in the house I would have been trapped. Some time aftermidnight, Poppy come to see how I was getting on. She had climbed all theway up to bring me a drink of water and an extra blanket. That woman lookedafter us as though wTe were her own children. Whenever I tried to thank hershe would merely say &quot; It is for France.&quot;42. No attack developed on the Coq d&apos;Or, although a party of soldiersarrived and sat drinking in the bar till all hours. The Maquis reckoned thatthe Italians were afraid to attack. Mussolini had fallen from power a week-before and the &quot; Ities were less brave than ever. Furthermore, one or twoof them had been bumped off recently by the Maquis and the scrap which theyhad had the previous winter had cost them clear. 143. Poppy and the girls crept up from the Coq d&apos;Or at dawn with hotbowls of coffee into which we dipped the hard black bread in.order to soften it.After breakfast the Maquis started to clean their guns. This was a ritualcarried out every morning, and I noticed that only half were cleaned at a time.The rest were ready in case they had to be used immediately. It was only asmall point, but I learnt that they had once been surprised whilst they werecleaning their guns and they weren&apos;t going to let it happen again. If onlythe Home Guards, who \ypn&apos;t go on parades and the erks (and officers for that matter) who have to.be driven to lectures on weapon training, could have seenwith what loving care a Maquis treats his weapons ! The Maquis even practisestripping their guns and reassembling them blindfolded.44. As the sun got higher the day got hotter and hotter. By 11 oclock Iwould have given anything for a drink. I had my tin of orange juice with me and was very tempted to open it, but I thought that a time might come more urgent than the present when I might neecL it. By shaking it at my ear I couldhear the liquid rushing about inside and that helped a little. At mid-day, Poppyappeared again with a two-gallon water can full of water. Never has w-atertasted so wonderful.45. At dipner-time we set off down the hillside to partake of our dipnerwhich was laid, put on about a dozen plates in one of the lower passages. Herewe were an army marching down the mountainside inside the hut bushes[28290]&apos; &apos; &apos;* c
and no one&apos;could see us! I had two fried eggs for lunch, fried in butter, andthe Maquis had boiled potatoes and cheese and black bread with, of course,wine. They seemed to drink nothing but wine. We went back to our normalhide-out high up in the mountain after dinner, and we were lying on the groundplaying cards when Kobin Hood brought in a civilian shaking with fright andas white as a sheet. He was a youth of about 20, with a week-looking chin,and he had been caught snooping around. He said he was just picking nuts,but they weren&apos;t taking any chances with him. He was to be kept a prisoneruntil I got away and if I was subsequently captured he was going to be shot.He seemed, quite relieved as he thought he was going to be shot on the spot. Hewasivt tied up in any way. Robin Hood said that he was so scared he wouldirthave the guts to make a break for it. They had had him under suspicion forsome time, but not enough proof to shoot him. He was still there, crouchingunder the nut bushes, when I left! Nobody ever spoke to him and he just hungaround like a dog, and like a dog lie had the odd piece of bread thrown at him.46. The Chief of the Secret Army came to see me during the afternoon.He was in civil kit, but no Air Marshal could have had a more courteous reception.The discipline among the Maquis was magnificent. Nobody ever moaned at being given a job to do. Everybody was mad keen and they even practised, in the openair, going into an office, saluting, removing headgear, replacing headgear, salutingand going out again ! In preparation for going over the frontier into SwitzerlandI was made to practise crawling, which, with my two bad arms, I had to clo on myback. I got quite good at it after a bit but it is somewhat hard on clothes. TheChief of the Army had come to say that arrangements had been made for me witha motor cyclist outrider at 5 p.m. I had no papers and the marks on my face wereenough to give me away anyway, so the motor cyclist was to go first and make certain that the road was clear of controls. If we came across a gendarme Iwas to moan and the driver would say that I had met with a terrible accident andhe was rushing me to hospital.47: There is a great shortage of razor blades in France and that afternoon,without any anaesthetic. I was shaved by Robin Hood with a blade six weeks old !He left the hair round the cuts and chopped the rest off. It was murder. FinallyI was dressed with a trilby hat pulled well over the forehead to hide the cutsand a pair of huge dark glasses to cover my black eyes. All I had to do was to dabmy nose with a handkerchief to cover a cut there and I looked fairly normal.48. At 5 o&apos;clock the car arrived with Nicko as driver and a motor cycle asescort. I was to hide in the bushes alongside the road opposite the Coq d&apos;Orand as the car drove slowly down the lane I was supposed to nip out and get in.Just as I stepped out of the bushes Poppy appeared from somewhere, threw herarms round my neck and kissed me on both cheeks, bursting into tears at the sametime. It rather upset our predetermined plan, but fortunately I was able toget aboard without anyone seeing me. We set off for Geneva and after a fewkilometres stopped outside a garage to get some petrol for the motor-bike. Thistook quite a while as I gathered it was a Black Market deal. I sat in the backof the car and watched people go past. I was quite amazed that no one took anynotice of me. The deal for petrol for the motor-bike was eventually concludedand off we set once more. Things went fairly smoothly until we came to an enormous bridge over a deep valley. We had just turned on to the bridge when we noticed what appeared to be a traffic jam at the far end. We all thoughtit was a traffic control and that the motor cyclist had been caught. I noticedNicko fingering his revolver and thought I&apos;d better do the same though whether Ishould have had sufficient courage to fire the darn thing was another matter.When we got to the far end we found three completely deserted &apos;buses and nobodythere at all. We heaved a sigh of relief and drove on. At a town calledCruseilles we pulled up before entering while the motor-bike went ahead to do a thorough reconnaissance. He returned after ten minutes, gave us the O.K. andwe drove on. The next halt was otitside St. Julien. Here, however, the motorcyclist returned shaking his head. There was a heated discussion in very fastFrench, not a word of which I understood. Finally, Nicko suggested that Ishould get out and hide in some bushes whilst they drove on into the town andsaw how the land lay. I&apos;d just started to climb up to the bushes when Nickocalled out in French, &quot;Quick, spend a penny &quot; (or words to that effect). An&quot; Ity &quot; on a bicycle was coming up the road and to avoid appearing suspiciousI attended to the supposed call of nature. An added advantage was that I couldkeep my back to him and he couldn&apos;t&apos;t see my face.
49. I lay in the bushes for 20 minutes and finally the car and motor-cyclereturned. They said it was hopeless trying to get through to-day and that theywould take me to a little farm where it was very tranquil. Tranquil was theright word. It was in the bottom of a very deep valley with never a sound of atrain, car, aircraft or internal combustion engine of any kind. I never quiteworked out the relationships of the people who lived there. There was a youngnon-mobilised Maquis called Andre, his wife, a woman of about 30 with a babywhich wasn&apos;t&apos;t hers and a young girl of about 17.50. Before they left Nicko told me that there had been 7,000 people at thefuneral of my crew that morning. We had heard the bell tolling when we wereway up the hillside. The crowd had sung the Marseillaise and nearly everybodyhad brought flowers. Many of the wreaths were in the form of a Croix deLorraine. Nicko had taken a film of the funeral and he now presented me withthe &quot;film and a full description of the ceremony, which he had put on paper. I myself would have liked to have sent some flowers but, this being impracticableat the time, other arrangements were made, and one month after the funeral awreath was put on the grave (it was a communal grave) from me with a notereading as follows : &quot; To : Johnnie,Bob,Mack,Maden,Pollard andDavies.Soyez tranquil.   Nous acheverons le tache.Votre Capitain, &apos; Taffy.&apos;&quot;It was considered that an unusual incident of this sort would help to bolster upmorale. Nicko assured me that the grave would.never be without flowers andthat they were getting up a subscription to buy a suitable gravestone.51. He also had information about the load which I had jettisoned.Apparently the Italians had only got four of the containers. The rest had&quot; mysteriously &quot; disappeared. They were having a bit of a job finding out whohad it, but the fact that it was distributed amongst a vast number of people made it even more difficult for the Italians to find it. Apart from the arms, a largesum of money, 100 pairs of boots and hundreds of tins of sardines were in french hands.52. Nicko and his party left me then in the care of Andre, saying that was to remain here until called for. Then ensued a period of absolute peace.For the first time since I had left England I was able to eat and, like everybodyelse, Andre&apos;s family just couldn&apos;t&apos;t do enough for me. Here I had my first washfor three days and I spent all day long lying in a long deck chair under a Victoriaplum tree in the garden just sleeping and eating plums. I always kept a pro-Nazipaper handy to put over my face and pretend I was asleep when the neighbourscalled. The paper was called Le Petit Dawphinois and it certainly stoppedpeople talking to me. Andre told the neighbours that I was a relative from Lyonswho had met with an accident.&apos; In the evenings, just after sundown, we would go for walks up the valley, and as we passed the farm houses we could hear themlistening to the French news from England. It always amazed me how newstravelled round Haute Savoie. On the 19th August Andre told me that all thepeople in the valley were saying that an Armistice Commission was on its way from Italy to Lisbon. This was, in fact, true, but was not announced to the worlduntil the 9th September.53. While I was sitting in the kitchen the night of my arrival Andrewent quietly through to the back bedroom, and I knew what he was going to doeven before he came back. Each of the Maquis at the Coq d&apos;Or, on finding mealone in my room, mysteriously backed out again only to return with his revolver,which he would show me with great pride. In this case Andre did exactly thesame. His was a long barrel -22 with &quot; Property of the United States &quot; written on it in a similar manner to my own. All the Maquis seemed to have revolvers,but they all seemed to be of different calibres.54. Life was very pleasant at Andre&apos;s and I had a feeling of completesecurity until the second night, when I woke up at 2 am. to hear a womanscreaming her head off. I broke out into a sweat of fear right away as I imaginedthat the Gestapo had got hold of one of the women folk and were trying to force[28290] &quot; d
her to tell them where I was. I tried to cock the Colt but I couldn&apos;t&apos;t do it with my one hand. Then I thought I might risk a jump from the bedroom window,which was fairly low, and make a dash for open country. Just as I climbed onthe sill there was a piercing scream from almost right below me and, in the fullmoon, I could see a woman throwing her head back making all the noise. I wasa bit taken aback at first, but I soon realised that she was as mad as a hatterand then Andre let me know that it was all right. Apparently she usually camearound this way at full moon. He seemed quite casual about it, but my pulsedidn&apos;t settle down till after breakfast.55. On the afternoon of the third day at Andrews I retired to bed after an enormous lunch (who said France was starving ?) and awoke to find the room full of people with Nicko one side of the bed and a young blonde girl of 22 on theother. Nicko introduced me to the girl, who was called Annette, and said thatI was to go courting with her that afternoon. The principle being that I had to approach the Swiss frontier through some wild country. If I went alone I wouldappear suspicious, but if I had a girl with me the Italian frontier guardwould merely think that we were &quot;walking out.&quot;56. After the usual French ceremony of saying &quot;-Good-bye &quot; we set off ina Citroen saloon, which was propelled by a Gasogene (wood fuel burning)apparatus. The driver, Nicko and Annette sat in front and I sat in the backwith the spare wdieel and great bags of fuel for the Gasogene apparatus. Thewindows were blacked out and I never quite gathered whether this was done sothat my face could not be seen or whether it was to hide the fact that the backof the car was usually like a cellar full of coal as the fuel for the Gasogene had tobe carried somewhere.57. As we climbed up out of the valley we met the motor cyclist outrider,who was waiting for us under a tree. He set off ahead of us at high speed and immediately our rear inner tyre burst. Muttering terrible French curses aboutersatz rubber. Nicko and the driver set to to change the wheel. Then the jackwouldn&apos;t fit. It was very hot and I sat on a high pumpkin at the side of the roadwhilst Annette kept at a respectable distance from the terrible French curses.Finally, the wdieel was changed and we chased off after the motor cycle. this time I was to approach Switzerland from another direction altogether, which meant a.drive of about 40 kilom. We passed through the town of Cruseilles once more and ran through some glorious country towards Bonneville. It was an extremely hot day and the Gasogene apparatus made things even hotter stillinside the car. I wound down my blacked-out windows as we were in fairly open country and gulped great quantities of fresh air. We caught up with the motorcyclist after a lengthy chase and the whole journey went very smoothly. Therewere about four danger-spots on the way, but there was no control at any of them.We nearly lost our motor cyclist once more when he shot under the level-crossinggates at Bonne just as they were coming down. Wild shrieks on the horn from our driver persuaded the railway man to stop winding down the gates and we shotunder them with a few inches to spare at one corner. In Bonne there were quite a few Italians sitting on the Avails of a barracks off duty. They looked A^ery likethe prisoners of war in England; in fact, I was subconsciously looking for thebrightly coloured patch on their trouser legs.58. When we were about 2 miles from our crossing-point at the frontier westopped the car and sat at the roadside while Annette went on ahead on the pillionof the motor cycle to see that all was clear. While Ave were sitting there a verysmall motor cycle with two enormous Italian soldiers (1 should think they wereWarrant Officers by the girth of their stomachs) went past. For the first time I felt more interest than fear at seeing them. The motor bike returned to say thatall Avas O.K. and we set off on our last leg. We turned into a very third-rate road,Avent down it a short distance and got out. The driver went back in the car andAnnette, Nicko, the motor cyclist and I strolled on down the lane. It was essentialto stroll and not to walk in order to allay suspicion. I had discarded the slingwhich supported my arm and had my thumb in my coat button and Annette&apos;ssmall coat over my arm. Provided I pretended to blow my nose if anyone passedme, they woulcln&apos;t be able to tell that I had met with an accident.59. We soon got a good view of the lie of the land ahead. This small laneled down the side of a valley, across a railway line and right up to the frontierpost ahead. Nicko and the motor cyclist were going on to the frontier post andwere going to buy cigarettes from the Italian guard while Annette and I turnedright &quot;after crossing the railway and wandered through a small copse of bushesand a couple of hay fields.  Our eventual object was to reach a farm-house on the
further hill, where we were to hide till dark and then cross the wire. We passedsome French farm labourers working in a field just as we came to the railway,and my faith in my disguise was somewhat shattered by one of them giving theV-Sign. We separated after crossing the railway, and Annette and I started onour walk across-country. When we got in the bushes I cocked my Colt and gotmy R.A.F. wire-cutters handy. The frontier looked so close now that I was deter-mined to get across at any cost. From the bushes up to the farm-house we had to cross two fields and walk a few hundred yards along a main road. It was ghastlystrolling along hand in hand and chewing grass. My mouth was dead dry. Itwas worse than crossing the Dutch coast at nought feet on a moonlight night. we reached the farm-house and went into the kitchen, which was in the front of thehouse facing the road. They had been expecting us and the old farmer was over-joyed. He kept saying that I was the first Englishman that he had passed overthe frontier and that he felt very honoured. I drank a pint of fresh milk and weall sat round the kitchen table chatting. It was cool in the kitchen and outsidewe could watch people passing by on the road.60. Suddenly I could hear the noise of singing in the distance. It was coming nearer and getting louder and it wasn&apos;t&apos;t just ordinary singing. It wasreal opera stuff sung in harmony by several voices. Then the songsters came insight. They&apos; were five very small short Italians with bent backs and long gunsover their shoulders but on their heads were enormous hats with great longfeathers in. The feathers seemed to trail from the front of the hat to the middleof their backs. These were the frontier guard looking more like a scene froma comic opera and all my fear seemed to disappear. From that moment onwardstill I got across the border I was overcome with a terrific &quot; Superiority Aertex.&quot;61. Nicko and the motor cyclist arrived soon afterwards. They had keptthe Ities &quot; interested at the frontier post while we crossed the tAvo fields. Theypartook of a glass of wine and AATe sat round the table chatting for quite a Avhile.Nicko told me that the Italians A\rere announcing the fact that they had shot mecIoaaoi. French people in Annecy said that the Italians had indeed opened- fire on us when we fleAv north along the railway. We had apparently passed over aneAv barracks where a thousand men Avere billeted. They manned a machine gunall night long as the Maquis Avere rather inclined to lob the odd hand grenadeover the wall. The strange thing is that no one in the aircraft saw us beingfired at and I didn&apos;t feel anything hitting us, but then I&apos;ve been hit by -303before and not knoAvn about it. If they did hit us then they may have got us inthe gallery pipes, which would explain why Nos. 2 and 4 tanks on which AveAvere running would show their warning lights and appear to be empty. It isa pity we couldn&apos;t&apos;t have changed into Nos. 1 and 3 earlier to confirm this.Personally, I don&apos;t think they did hit us.62. As Annette and I had some tAvo hours to wait before it Avould be darkenough to go any further, Nicko and the motor cyclist said &quot; Good-bye &quot; and AArentoff back to Annecy. The farmer took Annette and me out to his summer-house in the garden. This was coArered with rambler roses groAving on lattice-vrorkand from here we Avere able to watch the Italian frontier patrols through thelattice-work without them seeing us. They Averen&apos;t A^ery interested in their work.It would have been easy enough to craAvl out the 100 yards in daylight and cutthrough the wire while the patrol was the other end of his beat.63. The farmer himself was an amazing character. He hated the sight of all Italians and Germans and told&quot;you about it in a Arery loud A&quot;oice, particularlyAvhenever any Italians passed the front of the house. It rather frightened me,but he seemed to enjoy speaking his mind so that they could hear him. As IAvas an Englishman he said I must know all about horses and I had to go and see pony which he had bred himself. It Avas 15 months old and about 15 handshigh, and I must say it Avas in grand condition compared with most horses onthe Continent. Noav it so happens that horses make me sneeze and I thought thatin view of the silence necessary for our frontier crossing I had better not gonear this pony. Flowever, I couldn&apos;t&apos;t get out of it. I was English and the oldboy Avanted my opinion ! I had to stroke the Avretched animal and appear veryknowledgeable by looking at its teeth and feeling its fetlocks. Then I startedsneezing! ! From the pony we passed on to the coavs and then we saw some heifershe Avas rearing and finally the pigs. Altogether it Avas a very interesting evening and I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I had been able to keep my mind onthings instead of tlie coming crossing of the Frontier.64. In the kitchen there Avere tAvo clocks with an hour&apos;s difference botAveenthem.   One he called SavIss and the other Enemy time!   When it began to get
dark (at about 8 p.m. Swiss time) the farmer sent his two daughters to thefrontier posts to check up on the Italians&apos; activity. A thunder-storm had started and both girls returned with the news that as it was raining the patrols had come in and that they were all playing cards! We crept from-the back of thehouse to a small kitchen garden which he had only about 30 feet from the wire.We hid in the sunflowers. He showed me the exact spot to tackle the wire. Hesaid it was loose at the bottom and seeing that I had my R.A.F. pliers ready he asked me not to cut it if I could help it as that might raise suspicion. Annetteand I crept quickly across to the wire and 1 was just lifting the bottom upwhen there was a terrific flash of lightning. We were only 50 yards from thefortified house in which the patrols were sheltering but they had closed theshutters over the former windows to keep the rain out! It was a bit of a tightsqueeze but I managed to get under the wire on my back while Annette heldit up. She being very slim and athletic nipped through quickly after me. Wetucked the wh*e away at the bottom amongst the long grass so that it didn&apos;t lookas though it had been disturbed and set oft&apos; across an enormous field.65. &quot;Libre.&quot; whispered Annette. I couldn&apos;t&apos;t reply. I just squeezed herhand I was about to sneeze again. Ever since I had interviewed that wretchedhorse I had been sneezing and I had only been able to keep the sneezes in checkwhile we crossed the wire. We fully expected to be challenged as soon as we goton the Swiss side as we had seen a Swiss Douanier in the field we were crossingjust before sundown. We crossed the field without incident and had walkedabout half a kilometre down a lane when a command of &quot; Halt &quot; rang out. Wehalted. The Swiss challenging us was so cunningly concealed that we didn&apos;teven know where the challenge had come from. A pause ensued and Annettewith the usual feminine attitude towards men and their command started towalk forward again. I grabbed her arm and tried to explain that it was asking fortrouble to starUforward again once you had been halted. Eventually the mysteryvoice appeared coming from behind a tree. He seemed quite prepared to let us have it and brandished a bayonet at our throats. His mood changed whenhe saw that Annette was a woman and that I was in no fit state for making any trouble. He told us to go to the guard-house further along the road andreport. Much to my surprise he dichrt accompany us and I was able to uncockthe Colt and put it on safe before we went in. I thought the swiss might takea poor view of it if they found that it was all set for firing when I was on Swissterritory.66. There appeared to be only one man on duty at the guard-house. He hada very pleasant face and seemed to be highly amused at us. He rang up geneva and said we should have to wait about half an hour for a car which was comingfor us. Meanwhile he tried a bit of cross-examination on his own. Annetteh^d warned me not to answer any questions until I contacted the right man.67. As we didn&apos;t reply to the Douanier&apos;s questions, he more or less answeredthem for us something like this :i English, eh?&quot; &quot; Aviator. I should think&apos;&quot;&apos;;1 You must have been the chap who crashed at Annecy.&quot; &quot; We&apos;ve been expectingyou to come in for the last two or three days &quot; ! ! !68. I was again very thirsty and asked the Douanier for a drink. He wentout to get me a bowl of milk and left Annette and me alone in the guard-housewith eleven rifles and eleven revolvers all loaded hanging on the wall. I took theopportunity to present Annette with one of my small compasses and a monthlater I was able to present her with an R.A.F. brooch made in Geneva.69. An enormous man in a correspondingly large car eventually came tofetch us and drove us into Geneva to the Hotel where rooms were ready preparedfor us. He seemed to be a man of some importance in Switzerland. We werechallenged five times between the frontier and Geneva and, despite the fact thathe had a couple of fishy-looking customers in the back of the car, without anyidentity papers, the journey was without incident.70. We arrived at the Hotel at midnight just six clays to the hour (Swiss)after I crashed near Annecy.71. Next morning at 9 o&apos;elock I was eating a breakfast of white rolls,strawberry jam and coffee with Annette in her room when two men came in. one was a Swiss of the Intelligence Service and the other was so typically EnglishI could guess who it was right away. I had arrived. The only thing that worriedme was being caught in such a compromising situation by another Englishman.What on earth was I doing, with a wife and child in England, having breakfastin the bedroom of a luscious blonde in Geneva!   Cest la Guerre.
