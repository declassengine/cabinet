The War Cabinet&apos;at their 139th Meeting (W.M.        139thConclusions,  Item 2) had before them a Memorandum by the Ministerof State  (W.P.(q4) 561, dated 19th October,  19UI4.) reporting thepresent position of the negotiations between Lord De La Warr andthe Emperor of Ethiopia,  and in particular the difficulties LordDe La Warr had encountered in securing leases of the Ogaden. andthe Reserved Areas in Harar,ThewarCabinet decided that theCommittee on Policy in Ethiopia should be reconvened to considerthe matter and to submit recommendations as to what further instructions should be given to Lord De La Warr.2,intoTheaccountueCommitteethe&apos; follo\have reviewed the question:ing cons iderations:and have taken(i)(ii)(iii)Lordgiven)e La Warr should beminimum requirements of His Majesty1sthese are not conceded by the Emperorinstructed to return home.instructions as to theGovernment-.

While technically,  therefore,the Emperor might consider himself free to regard theagreement as having terminated if negotiations finallybroke down,  it hardly seems likely that he would risk the displeasure of His Majesty&apos;s Government by takingprecipitate action before the two months had expired.(v) Instructions have in Ethiopia as toevent of the Enrpethe Reserved area would be withdrawunless the Ethiopother military esThe British Mil itto be in any realstood to be morealready been issued to British troops the action to be taken by them in theror proceeding to occupy the Ogaden ands.   .

(vi)    The question whether any further instructions to theMilitary Authorities are necessary is not one forimmediate decision and could be left until Lord De LaWarr returns.(vii)    Legally there is no difference between&apos; the position of the ogaden and&apos;that of the Reserved Areas in Harar.      Thefact that the Italians made the Ogaden part of theProvince of Italian Somaliland does not affect the legal position.      So far as grazing rights are concerned the rights of the.British Somali tribes, both in theHarar and in the Baud district of the Ogaden.,  are founded on the Treaty of 1897-(viii)    Lord De La Warr has asked for guidance whether,  in theevent of acute difficulties arising over the ReservedAreas, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared toconsider as the price of avoiding any abatement of our full claim in respect of these areas, financialassistance for a Proposed Development Trust up to afurther half million pounds.3. Having regard to the above considerations, the Committeeare unanimously agreed that the following further instructions should be sent to Lord De La Warr as regards the Ogaden and thoReserved Areas of the Harar.(i) He should inform the Emperor that there is no questionof His Majesty1s Government seeking to bring aboutpermanent territorial changes tnere by force and thatas respects any changes that may be proposed in thefinal peace settlement,  it is contemplated that&apos; theyshould be the subject of negotiations and would only,be made by mutual consent.(ii) He should propose that His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldadminister the areas &quot;by arrangement with the Emperor&quot;.It should be made clear to the Emperor that we wouldadminister them as the responsible authorities butthat the territories belong to the Emperor,&apos; andthat our right to administer then was derived from an,1agreement with him.      If it appears that there are any matters about which we could agree, withoutprejudice to effective administration of the territories, to consult the Emperor, Lord De La Warrshould be instructed to submit recommendations toHis Majesty&apos;s Government.      He should be informedalso that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not objectto a provision in the agreement stating that theEmperor had asked His Majesty&apos;s Government to administer the territories pending the final peace settlement.(iii) Until it is known what the Emperor himself proposesregarding financial assistance to Ethiopia, Lord DeLa Warr should not make any proposal to the Emperorthat financial assistance under the heading of a proposed Development Trust up to a further half millionpounds should be given.      When the Emperor&apos;s proposals are known, Lord De La Warr should seek the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    It may be desirable,  inthe event ol the Emperor accepting the proposals contained in paragraph (ii) above (an arrangement whichwould not be a lease and would not involve the paymentof a rent) to give some - increased financial inducement to the Emperor as an alternative to a rent.

2 *j %)(iv) Lord De La Warr should he informed that the conclusionsstated above represent the minimum requirements of His- Majesty&apos;s Government and that if he is unable to bringnegotiations with the Emperor to a successful conclusion on this basis he should return home.Lj.. So far as the British Troops in Ethiopia and the british military Mission are concerned no fresh instructions are atpresent required.5. If Lord De La Warr&apos;s negotiations are unsuccessful itwill be necessary for&apos; the War Cabinet to reconsider the whole situation afresh.j.a.(On &quot;behalf of the Committee).Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.,.26th October,  19hk.m
