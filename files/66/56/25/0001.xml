This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ GovernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, October, 1944   ;fVTOP secret.P. (44) 575i%th October, 1944.142The circulation  of this   paper  has  been strictly   limited.    It   is   issued   for   the personal use of copy No. 36WAR CABINETTHE POST-WAR army memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. For many months the War Office has been preparing plans for the reconstruction of the Regular Army during and after the war.2. The Chiefs of Staff are now engaged on a study of the framework of Imperialstrategy in the post-war period which will ultimately reveal the extent of anticipatedmilitary commitments all over the world and will suggest how they should be met,whether by one or other of the three Fighting Services or by a combination of two ormore of them. This study is bound up with so many incalculable factors that its completion cannot be expected for a long time, and its acceptance or modification bythe Government of the day and its implementation in detail must absorb many months of further study.3. In the meantime it is clear that on any basis post-war strategy will demand ofthe land forces a contribution towards the following commitments:  (a) Occupational troops for a period of years.(&amp;) Garrisons throughout the Empire.(c) An Imperial reserve.(d) A world security organization in an advanced state of readiness.(e) The necessary base and training organizations at home to support thesecontributions.4. This contribution will represent the peace-time commitment of an Army of a given size. But this Regular Army will form the basis only of expansion for war. Itis improbable that any Government would be prepared to face the risk of another warwith no other trained land forces at its disposal than can be drawn from a professionalArmy and its reserves, and it is equally clear that ordinary reserve forces can do littlemore than fill up peace-time regular cadres to full war strength. It follows that rapid and smooth expansion to military readiness on a national basis can only be ensured bythe acceptance of some form of compulsory military training of youth. Certainly thecountry could not afford the cost of the regular formations which would otherwise benecessary. It is possible that some of the commitments in paragraph 3 (notably (a))could be met by men in the last period of ^compulsory training; thereby reducing thecalls upon and the size of the Regular Army.5. The question of compulsory military service is controversial, and it may not be reasonable to ask the Government as now constituted to make any pronouncement onthis matter. The desirability of compulsory military service as such is a matter ofopinion, though the military need for it is, to my mind, beyond argument, and accept-ance of the principle now would, I have no doubt, enhance our prestige as a militaryworld power in the years to come.6. If, therefore, the War Cabinet is prepared to take a decision upon this question,I, as Secretary of State for&apos;War, would welcome it. In the alternative the object of this paper is to inform the War Cabinet that, in the absence of any specific decisions on these subjects, I have authorized the planning of the Regular Army to proceed on certain assumptions which include the existence of a compulsory military training for youthslasting for one year, with a subsequent reserve liability of some five years.
7. The provisional acceptance of these assumptions will enable my department toproceed with its examination of the many and difficult problems which will arise asregards the raising of the troops, their accommodation, their organization, training, etc.No final plans can be completed until the review of the Chiefs of Staff which I have mentioned in paragraph 2 is completed, for until then we shall not know the precisenumber of soldiers required nor their distribution throughout the world.8. In the meantime it is of increasing importance that we should raise a RegularArmy by successive stages. The Regular Army was merged into the National Armiesat the outbreak of war, and has now, except for its cadre of regular officers, practicallyceased to exist. The bulk of regular soldiers have already completed their engagements with the colours, and the service of most of the remainder will run out by 1947. Onlya limited number of junior regular officers have been obtained since the outbreak of war.9. There are a great number of young men now serving of the type that we require,and, if service in the Army can be properly presented to them as an honourable pro-fession carrying with it rewards and opportunities for advancement no less beneficialthan those open to them in the ordinary labour market, I have no doubt that by theend of the war with Japan we shall have secured a substantial instalment of our post-war needs.- It is obviously desirable that the dates of entry, and consequently of departure from the Army, should be spread and that we should not depend, as we didafter the last war, upon a hasty and last moment attempt at producing the trainedsoldiers which it is common ground we cannot do without at the end of this war.10. For this purpose, therefore, I am having completed within the department theoutlines of the terms of engagement of professional soldiers, including their emolu-ments, prospects and retiring benefits. I hope that the interdepartmental examinationof these proposals may not be unduly delayed and that I shall be in a position to place them before the War Cabinet in due course.P. J. G.The War Office,i&amp;th October, 1944.(B44/188)   no   10/44   W.O.P.   19498
