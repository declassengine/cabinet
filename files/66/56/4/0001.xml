The prisoners of war recently repatriated from Germany included officersspecially briefed by the Senior British&apos; Officers of each Ofiag for interrogation on arrival in this country. From their interrogation it is evident that apprehension exists in the camps about the attitude towards prisoners of war likely to be adopted by certain sections of the German community and in particular by the S.S. and Gestapo.They reported that whereas the morale of the normal Army guards was low, that ofthe S.S. remained good and attempts at fraternization with the prisoners by civiliansand guards had ceased through fear of the S.S. and Gestapo. In some camps membersof the German staffs have hinted to the prisoners that they will be used as hostages or . The following instances of the murder of prisoners of war captured in the courseof the present fighting in France show that there is foundation for these fears. (Whereresponsibility can be definitely attributed to S.S. troops or Gestapo this has been men-tioned.)(a) June, 1944. A Canadian prisoner of war who was being marched throughCaen saw the bodies of British soldiers lying in rows beside the road. Hewas informed by the Germans that all had been wounded and then tankshad been run over them to kill them. (Reported by the eye witness whosubsequently escaped.)(6) June, 1944. A party of one Canadian officer, 23 Canadian other ranks andtwo British other ranks were shot at Chateau dAudrieu by members of the12th S.S. Reconnaissance Battalion of the 12th S.S.

A further party of seven Canadian soldiers were shot at Rouenby the 12th S.S. Panzer Engineer Battalion. (The facts of this case havealso been established by a Court of Enquiry convened by S.C.A.E.F.)(d) July, 1944. Five Allied airmen were brought to the Headquarters of the857th Regiment (346th Infantry Division). Four days after their arrival aGerman officer asked whether they had been given food. He was told theyhad not. The officer then said that the3&apos; would be shot that night. Nothing-further was ever heard of these prisoners of war. (Reported by a Germanprisoner of war who was present at the headquarters.)(e) July, 1944. A British fighter pilot made a forced landing at Champs Rabatsand broke his leg. He was found by a German officer who shouted at him&quot; You swine, you are still alive &quot;, and shot him. (Reported by a Germanprisoner of war who was an eye witness.)P. J. G.killed.

A party of 8 prisoners of war from the S.A.S. Regiment were taken to a wood near Noailles by German soldiers in charge of two S.S.officers and one Gestapo official.

4. It has been further ascertained from the interrogation of a German prisoner ofwar that a bureau has been established within the framework of the S.S. Organizationcharged with duties connected with the prevention of escapes of Allied prisoners of war.The exact functions of this bureau have not yet been determined, but it shows that theS.S. are taking over from the ordinary military authorities some responsibility for security measures against prisoners of war.5. The following action has been taken:  (a) Strong complaints have already been made through the Protecting Powerconcerning the principal episodes listed above, namely, the murder of the50 officers from Stalag Luft III and of the two parties of Canadians.(&amp;) A comprehensive complaint is being concerted with the Foreign Office covering the other cases of the murder of prisoners of war.(c) The War Cabinet have agreed that a solemn warning should be issued to theGermans by the three Allied Governments in the event of a threat by Hitlerto murder prisoners of war or on the cessation of organized military resist-ance.* This decision was made subject to approval by the Prime Minister,who has agreed. The Chiefs of Staff have recommended immediate actionto secure the agreement of the United States Government and the Govern-ment of the U.S.S.R. and to prepare the necessary arrangements.!* W.M.
