Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1941.SECRET. Copy No. ,28W.P. (.41) 4.January 6, 1941. SJWAR CABINET.THE EASTERN GROUP CONFERENCE.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India and the Minister ofSupply.THE recommendations of the Eastern Group Conference on Supply matters,which assembled at Delhi on the 25th October, and was attended by representstives of India, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, SouthernRhodesia, Burma, Ceylon, Palestine, Malaya, Hong Kong and the Conference of east African Governors, by the Ministry of Supply Mission to India and by representatives of the Netherlands East Indies as observers, have been received in summary form in telegrams from the Viceroy, the contents of which have been&apos;reproduced in a convenient form in a memorandum prepared by the India Office.*The Viceroy has also transmitted in a separate telegram No. 4090, dated the29th November,t the views of the Government of India upon the recommenda-tions. The views of the Ministry of Supply Mission upon the results of theConference have also been furnished, in telegram No. 4102/RM dated the29th November.I2. The recommendations deal with the Co-ordination of Supply, Finance,new Production and Shipping.(A) Co-ordination of Supply and Finance.(a) Provision Offices.3. The supply organisation proposed is based on a division of the Easternpart of the Empire into five areas of operations, or potential operations, viz. :(a) South and East Africa, (&amp;) the Sudan, Egypt, Palestine and Syria, (c) Iraq,India and Burma, (d) Malaya, and (e) Hong Kong. Each area would, it is contemplated; have an Internal Provision Office, which would arrange for theneeds of its area to be met from local resources as far as possible. For the rest,demands would be made upon a Central Provision Office, which would beresponsible for supplying all theatres of war in the Eastern Group, placing firmdemands for this purpose upon an Eastern Group Supply Council.(b) Eastern Group Supply Council.This body is to be appointed on a representative basis, the Chairman by thei United Kingdom Government, one member each by Australia, New Zealand, theUnion of South Africa and India, and one military member, who will representthe Imperial General Staff and will also be the head of the Central Provision Office.Other countries participating will not be difeeTly represented on the Council,but will have the right to send advisers. It may, however, be expedient later to accord full representation to the Netherlands East Indies if they come to play a prominent part in the operation of the general scheme.   In accordance with* Appendix I. f Appendix II. I Appendix III.[22059] b
the usual procedure in inter-Imperial bodies, the Colonial Dependencies will berepresented by the United Kingdom representative, but will retain the right tosend advisers if and when desired. Suitable arrangements will also be made tomaintain continuous liaison with Colonial Governments.This Council will be the keystone of the system which is proposed. TheConference proposed that it should be empowered to purchase and hold stocks and to call for information from all the participating countries, and to make arrangements for new production, with a view to meeting all demands from theCentral Provision Office. For this purpose it would need authority to incurfinancial commitments for forward buying, and to purchase and store goods,including the output of small suppliers. This authority, it is recognised, must come mainly from the United Kingdom Government, to whom it will be left, to effect recovery from the participating Governments in accordance with the separate financial settlements with each. Authority for incurring capitalcommitments is not proposed in the first instance, but is foreshadowed after theCouncil has settled down.4. So far as concerns the arrangements for Provision Offices in the severalareas proposed, and the Central Provision Office, there seems no reason why, ifthis system is accepted as convenient by the countries represented by theConference, it should not be accepted also by His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom subject to an adjustment of the areas covered by the LocalProvision Offices which is considered advisable by the War Office for the sake of conformity with the system of military command. Much will turn on theconstitution of the Central Provision Office. This is to be located in India, butindependent of the Government of India. It is recommended that it. should be under the control of an officer of the Imperial General Staff, and the Viceroyurges that an appointment be made forthwith, and that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment give an indication of where the staff, other than the Head, should comefrom. Provided that the proposals as to the Eastern Group Supply Council arealso accepted in substance, we suggest that the Secretary of State for War shouldbe authorised to select an officer for this purpose, and that the participatingGovernment should be notified of the selection. This officer could then be instructed to formulate early proposals as to the staffing of the Office. Hisposition in relation to the D.G.A.R. at the War Office will require to be defined.5. As regards the Eastern Group Supply Council, the name of theindividual whom His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would pro-pose to nominate for appointment as Chairman (Sir Archibald Carter, recentlySecretary to the Admiralty) has already been notified to &quot;the participating Govern-ments, and been accepted by them. Sir Alexander Roger and the Viceroy bothstress the essential urgency of establishing the Council. It seems likely that sir Archibald Carter will be able to reach India about the end of January.Character and Functions of the Council.6. On receipt by the Council of demands from the Central Provision office the primary function of the Council will be to allocate them among the participating Governments, who will thereupon take the responsibility of meetingthem, either by purchase from contractors or from their own State factories. TheCouncil will either pass on to London or refer back to the country of origin anypart of the demands received by it which cannot be met from the resources of theEastern countries.The Delhi Conference proposed that the Council should have power topurchase and hold stocks. But this would only appear to be necessary to providefor the case of small suppliers, such as Hong Kong. To establish the Council asa buying and holding authority except to this small extent would not, it seems tous, serve any necessary or useful purpose and would only result in overlappingand undue elaboration of machinery. The Council should not be a super Ministryof Supply, which would duplicate the work of the supply organisations of thevarious Eastern countries. All essential purposes will be served with a minimum of complication and machinery if the Council, having accepted responsibility for meeting demands preferred upon it by the Central Provision Office and havingallocated these demands among the various suppliers, is put in a position not actually to place contracts on its own account but to authorise the supply ino-Governments to do so by means of their own supply organisations and to enter, on
behalf of the authority from which the demand originates, into the necessary financial commitments with the Government to which the demand has been allocated. Subject to the supervision of the Council, the supplying governments would then be responsible for all future operations until the supplies are delivered to their destination, and would recover the costs of supply, including any necessarystorage, from the Government on behalf of which the financial commitment wasmade by the Council (which for the most part, of course, would be the Governmentof the United Kingdom), and the final liability would be settled in accordance withthe terms of the financial arrangements existing between the Governmentsconcerned. It should, however, be realised that the main purpose of the arrange-ment proposed-the purpose to which all details must be subordinated-isstrategic necessity, and therefore allowance must be made for the possibility thatat any time operational needs may have to override delivery arrangementspreviously contracted for.Extent of Supply Operations.7. Primarily the Council would be responsible for such classes of militarysupply as are dealt with by the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom. Itshould not, however, attempt to deal with all those classes, but only with thosewhich are wholly or substantially available from the resources of the countries represented upon it. We consider that it would be appropriate and sufficient to define its field by the exclusion of a limited list of supplies which must be obtainedwholly or for the most part from elsewhere. To ensure this point the list willbe communicated to the local provision authorities, whose demands are to become-ordinated with the Central Provision Office in India before they are preferredupon the Council. In addition it should deal with such other classes of supply asmay be specified (such as food, medical supplies and scientific supplies, if it isthought desirable that any or all of these should be added), but not petroleum and coal. In the case of the Royal Navy it would deal with such ordersas may be placed upon it by the Admiralty. In the case of the R.A.F. itwould deal with supplies of clothing, certain general and engineering stores,and food, in the latter case only to the extent that it may have responsibilitiesunder this head for the Army. It should not be directly responsible for rawmaterials, but should have at its disposal information as to the general positionrelating to the main raw materials required for military supply purposes.Policy Governing the Operations of the Council.8. The general idea guiding the operations of the Council should be that so long as present conditions governing shipping and the risks to shipping andthe location of our forces do not fundamentally change, all Allied and imperial forces in Africa, except West Africa, in Asia and in Australasia should as far aspossible be supplied from the co-ordinated resources of these territories. But this general conception should be subject to the following provisos : (a) New sources of supply should not be developed if production is not expected to commence before a given date to be laid down and alteredfrom time to time by or on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom.(b) It may not be possible, at any rate for the present, to contemplate schemes which require more than a limited transfer of skilled personnel or of plant and machine-tools from either the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates or Canada.(c) Orders are not to be placed if the cost is so very much higher as to outweigh the advantages in relation to shipping or the saving of dollar expenditure.9. The main advantage of the proposed Eastern Group Supply councils that it will help to secure the maximum co-operation and co-ordination ofthe various Eastern countries in achieving our objective, that is, of meeting tothe fullest extent from resources in that area the needs of the forces in the Near,Middle and Far East, in all those stores for which capacity is available or canbe provided at a reasonably early date and with due regard to production programme elsewhere. This advantage should be considerable, but there arecertain questions on which His Majesty&apos;s Government should state their viewsclearly at the outset, in order that there may be no misunderstanding.
(i) Extensive as are the resources of the Eastern countries for most of thegeneral and miscellaneous supplies required for military purposes and to alimited extent for armaments and munitions, the main war effort of the Empiremust, so far as concerns most of the more important and vital armaments and munitions, depend principally upon the productive capacity of this country and north America. To attempt to develop to any great extent the capacity of theEastern countries for supplies of this class would involve the transfer of asubstantial part of the limited resources of plant, machine tools and skilledpersonnel available to us in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.Any such transfer would involve some delay in production while it was being-effected, and in the case of transfer upon a large scale this delay might amountto as much as six months. Moreover, anything of the nature of the completetransfer of establishments already existing in the United Kingdom might have serious reactions upon opinion at home and abroad. It may well prove that someat any rate of the recommendations of the Delhi Conference for the expansion of capacity for certain classes of armaments and munitions could not be put intoeffect without a transference of productive resources which would conflict, withour vital requirements in the near future. We are not immediately concernedwith these recommendations, which will have individually to be considered withgreat care, as specific proposals are elaborated and submitted to us. But inorder not to incur the consequences of encouraging expectations that cannot berealised it seems desirable that in informing India and the Dominions of our general conclusions upon the recommendations of the Conference we should at thisstage sound a note of warning as to the gravity of the questions which will arise under this head. The expansion of capacity within the Eastern Empire countriesmust be considered with due regard to the interference or delay in the meetingelsewhere of strategically vital requirements which the allocation of plant,machine-tools and skilled personnel to establishments in the East would involve.(ii) The financial powers to be conceded to the Council will require carefuldefinition, and detailed consideration will be necessary between the Treasury,the War Office and the Ministry of Supply. Since, as the Conference recognises,the main financial burden for supply East of Suez (including, no doubt, theexpenses of the Eastern Supply Group Council) must rest with the UnitedKingdom Government, there will presumably be no question but that our viewson this important matter will be accepted. The Council should not, however, atall events for the present, be given authority to incur capital commitmentswithout reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.(iii) It is suggested by the Delhi Conference that the Council should have certain functions outside the sphere of military provision and relating to civileconomic problems.   The proposed functions are to (i) act as a clearing house of information on supply matters;(ii) advise on any matters referred to it;(iii) advise on and make representations to Governments of the eastern group about problems of essential civil needs.The scope of this suggestion is somewhat indefinite, and it is possible that ifit were adopted it would not in practice amount to much. But it would appear, inprinciple at any rate, that it might involve the Council in work that would bea serious addition to its primary responsibility and for which it would have no particular qualifications. It might lead to the trend of post-war trade beingunduly influenced by the requirements of war supply, and it would seem best that the Council should deal with civil economic problems only so far as they arise in connection with and are incidental to those of military supply. It is inevitable that the necessities of war supply should to some extent react upon thecivil economic position both immediately and prospectively. But the concern ofthe Council will be with the former, and its aims should, in our view, be to supply as much as possible from the East without overmuch concern for the indirecteconomic consequences.*(B) Supply Position and New Production.10. The recommendations of the Conference as to additional production tobe undertaken in the Eastern Countries, and the proposed distribution of this new production between the various participating countries, are shown inStatements A and B included in Appendix I.
HiThe financial implications of the various individual items cannot at present be stated and must, in any case, be considered separately. It is necessary,however, to draw attention to one point of first importance, which has alreadybeen touched upon in paragraph 9 (i) of this memorandum. The Conferencehave frankly stated that the provision of plant, generators, machine tools and skilled personnel is fundamental to the new production recommended. Havingregard to the demands being made, and likely to be made, upon us in these directions, it is improbable that provision can be made on the scale which hasobviously been assumed, short of a general transfer of plant and personnelalready occupied in this country, a course which, as indicated above, could not be) considered. If it is accepted that the war effort in this country and in north america must be maintained as at present planned, it will be necessary to limit the new production proposed by the Conference to those items which can beundertaken either from the resources in plant and personnel of the participating countries, or with such assistance under these heads as will not unduly interferewith that effort.Shipping.11. Subject to the concurrence of the Ministry of Shipping, it is recom-mended that the Council should be authorised to keep itself informed of theshipping position and to make representations to the Ministry of Shipping, as suggested by the Delhi Conference.Miscellaneous.12 Various subsidiary and detailed matters relating to organisation,finance, staff and so forth will have to be discussed and settled by the Departmentsconcerned with the Chairman-designate of the Council as soon as agreement hasbeen reached on the general lines of the scheme between ourselves and the otherGovernments concerned.Conclusion.13. We therefore seek authority to consult the Governments of theDominions, of India and of Burma as to the acceptance of the recommendationsof the Delhi Conference in general, with such modifications as are indicated inthis note, and, as soon as general agreement has been reached, to setting theproposed organisation in working order with as little delay as possible.L.

APPENDIX 1.Eastern Group Conference.Recommendations for the Co-ordination of Provision, Supply and Production.THE recommendations of the Conference cover two heads :  (i) Military Provision,(ii) Supply and Production.Provision might be defined as comprising the estimating of military requirements,the placing of demands on supply organisation and the holding and distributionof stocks.2. At present the Eastern Group countries are working on their own initiative and without co-ordination except to the extent that efforts are atpi&apos;esent co-ordinated by the War Office and the Ministry of Supply in the UnitedKingdom. Under the head of Provision there is no central office which can say what are the requirements of the Eastern Group for any particular item. each government endeavours to provision its own overseas forces, and there is wastefuluse of shipping. Similarly, supply and production have been organised by each country to meet its own needs without co-ordinated consideration of basic supplyproblems, and there has been excessive production of certain items coupled withdeficiency of other more important items.3. The new organisation proposed by the Conference should effectimprovement. But the Conference have emphasised that it is of the essence oftheir proposal that the primary concern of the organisation should be the needsof the military forces in the Eastern Group theatres of war. While theimportance of civil needs is recognised, it is felt that the new Organisation shouldnot at first attempt to interfere with the arrangements for the supply of civilneeds. The Conference have therefore recommended that the new organisation should exercise actual powers only in respect of military needs which form thesubject of provision in the military sense. Initial action in respect of civil needswill be advisory, but it is expected that, starting from comparatively smallbeginnings, the proposed Eastern Group Supply Council may, by agreementbetween the participating countries, move towards progressive centralisation ofall supply.4. The general picture is of military provision offices operating as at presentbut rearranged to some extent so as to give a better definition of responsibility byareas. These military provision offices, after drawing on local supplies as far aspossible, would place demands, not as at present on Provision Offices or supply departments of individual countries, but on the Central Provision Office in india which would be part of the Imperial Military machine. Central Provision office would place demands, after examination, on the Eastern Group Supply Council,which would arrange to have them met through existing Supply Departments in individual countries. The entire object of the proposal is co-ordination, i.e., toensure that all demands not met locally pass to one Provision Authority and thence to one Supply Authority. The accompanying plan will perhaps serve to illustrate how the organisation will work.5. In conclusion it should be stated that the Conference have stressed thatthe success of the new organisation will depend less upon its precise character and powers than upon the spirit of co-ordination in the Eastern Group.
Possible Immediate Theatres of War.Prom purely operational standpoint Nos. 1 to 5 form Middle East command, No. 6 formsanother command and Nos. 7, 8 and 9 form a third command. But since supply in its distribu-tive aspect must be based on ease of communications rather than necessity for co-ordinatedaction of military force involved, it is recommended that the nine areas be placed under fivelocal provision offices as indicated here:  1. 2. 3. 4.Africa south Sudan. Egypt. Palestineof Abyssinia(Kenya and uganda).local Pro-vision office no. 1.and Syria.a.Iraq.Local ProvisionOffice No. 2.6. 7.India. Burma.local ProvisionOffice No. 3.8.Malaya.LocalPro-visionOfficeNo. 4.9.HongKong.ILocalPro-visionOfficeNo. 5.Australia. Internalsupplyoffice (tocontinueto operate as here-tofore).These Five Local Provision Officeswill be formed out of such offices already existing in S. Africa, India,Malaya and Hong Kong. (Those in Australia and New Zealand notbeing immediately concerned with theatres of war will continue to operate as at present.) All these offices should, as at present, drawupon local sources of supply, placing demands on civil supply depart-ments where such exist in their respective areas. All demands not met locally would be passed toII I IINewZealand.-Internalsupplyoffice (tooperateas here-tofore).Central Supply (or Provision) Office.1. Organisation (a) To be situated in India, but independent of Government of India and under chargeof representative of Imperial General Staff.(6) It should be incumbent on participating Governments   to   contribute part of personnel.2. To be situated in India because (a) India is the most central country for war supply purposes.(6) As regards arrangements for personnel the nucleus can best be formed from existing provision Office of Army Headquarters, India, which is already working to someextent as a Central Provision Office for Middle East, India, Burma, singapore and Hong Kong.   (But see also Note 1 (&amp;).)3. Functions (a) To estimate, collate and review demands received from Local Provision Offices.(fa) To place firm demands in respect of both immediate and future requirements onEastern Group Supply Council.(c) Relations between Central Provision Office and. Supply Council to be similar tothat between Provision Office in any individual country and the supply department in that country. Just as in India the Army HeadquartersProvision Office estimates requirements and places demands on the supply department, so would the Central Provision Office, after settling demands,pass them on to the-jyEastern Group Supply Council.(a) Composition Chairman (appointed by Plis Majesty&apos;s Government in United Kingdom), four members(representing Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India), military officer(representing Imperial General Staff and who will be head of Central ProvisionOffice).(Members should be men of high standing enjoying confidence of their Governments.)Participating countries not directly represented on this Council would have the rightto send Advisers who would have access to the Council Agenda and be entitled toa hearing though having no vote.Participating countries should assist in supplying personnel for Council Secretariat.(b) Functions (1) To deal primarily with demands Of military provision and to be responsible for meeting all demands from Central Provision Office.(2) To have power To purchase;To hold stocks;To call for information with respect to the supply position in the group countries;To make arrangements for new production.
9163(3) Outside field of military provision to (i) act as clearing-house of information on supply matters; (ii) advise on any matters referred to it, and (iii) advise on and make representations to Group Governments about problems of essential civilneeds.    ::(4) Shipping: No change in the system is recommended, but Eastern Group supply council should (i) Be informed of shipping needs of participating countries;(ii) Maintain close contact with Shipping Control;(iii) Be in a position to make authoritative representations to the Ministry ofShipping on priorities for raw materials and finished articles of warsupply and for movement of materials and commodities essential for civil population.(c) Finance Council will need authority to incur financial commitments for forward buying(that is, conversion of demands of Central Provision Office into production programmesubject to break clauses); purchase and storage of output of small suppliers (such asHong Kong), and purchase and storage of goods for stock. As greater part of these commitments would be for oversea troops, authority for incurring them should comefrom His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom subject to recoveries inaccordance with financial settlements between the United Kingdom and participating governments. Authority incurring capital commitments need not be given in thefirst instance, though, when the Council has settled down, it would be the convenientagency for conducting negotiations with individual Governments. In the meantime,the provision of funds for the new production immediately recommended should beconsidered by the Governments concerned in direct communication with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom.Recommendations concerning Supply Position of New Production and shipping.I. Armaments.Apart from a number of recommendations not involving expenditure and requiring attention by participating Governments and/or Eastern Group supply council, the Conference has recommended substantial additions to the plannedprogramme of production for certain major munitions items involving a large programme of new factory construction, particularly in South Africa and Indiaand, to a lesser degree, in Australia and New Zealand.(Statements A and B appended give figures of the present plannedproduction, which is being reached by end of 1942, of more important items of guns, &amp;c, and of additional items recommended.)In addition, a new instrument factory is recommended in India.Conference has recorded the view that provision of plant generators, machine tools and skilled personnel is fundamental, and has asked this to be brought to thenotice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.II. General Stores.Item. Position.Cotton textiles, woollens   Satisfactory,   subject   to    certain specified shortages and need forstandardisation.Leather goods ....       ....

Telegram from the Viceroy, dated November 29, 1940.Secret.   4090.Eastern Group Conference. You have received summary of report tele-graphed by Conference office. We have considered report in council and our views are as follows :- 2. Co-ordination of supply and finance therefor. We support recommenda-tions of the conference and consider establishment of central provision office and eastern Group Supply Council matter of first urgency. Setting up of centralprovision office and appointment of its head is primarily for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom. We recommend that this be authorisedforthwith and that His Majesty&apos;s Government give an indication of where intheir opinion the staff other than its head should come from. We will co-operate in finding any personnel required to be provided in India and, if desired, inobtaining staff from participating Governments according to policy prescribed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. As regards personnel of eastern Group Supply Council we are prepared to fall in with views of Dominionsand will accept any Chairman acceptable to them. We agree that members of theCouncil should be men of the highest ability enjoying confidence of their Govern -ments. We agree with financial proposals under which Eastern Group supply council would have authority to incur commitments in order to produce flow ofsupplies required by the Central Provision Office. We also agree that onceCouncil has settled down it would be suitable agency for arranging new production. Establishment of Council is vital to success of Conference and weurge immediate communication with Dominions Governments with a view toassembly in India of Chairman and members within 6 weeks. Council shouldbe given considerable latitude in settling procedure and setting up its ownorganisation.3. Supply position and new production. We accept recommendation that each Government concerned should examine new production proposed by theConference and consult His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom aboutfinance to such extent as may be necessary. We are actively considering the taskallotted to India and with assistance of Ministry of Supply mission hope toreport within six to eight weeks what can be done. We recommend that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom inform the Dominions Govern-ments and ourselves at once whether conference programme is acceptable inprinciple and oan be supported by assistance in the shape of machine tools and skilled personnel. We believe there is now strong case for bodily transfer of plant and personnel to Eastern Group countries and a statement of policy onthis subject would be helpful.4. Shipping and other subsidiary proposals. We are satisfied that eastern group Supply Council could perform satisfactorily duties allotted to it in respectof shipping, co-ordination of non-military supplies and the like. Indeed, if itestablishes suitable organisation, it will almost certainly be used by participating countries far more extensively than conference report indicates.5. We stress essential urgency of (1) establishing Eastern Group supply council, (2) Securing in principle Conference productive programme. Immediatedecisions on these points will lead to real results. On the other hand, if council has not assembled within 2 months at the latest and programme is not approved,momentum will be lost and may not be recovered.
Telegram to Minister of Supply from Ministry of Supply Mission to India, dated november 29, 1940.Secret.   4102/R.M.Eastern Group Conference closed on the 25th November, and it wouldseem convenient for Ministry of Supply Mission to give its views on the work   )and conclusions of the Conference and to review the work of the Mission and its future plans.2. Conference was regarded by Mission and all delegations as highly successful. Valuable contacts and friendships were established between membersof the delegations. Exchanges of information were generously made. industrial activity and potential capacitjr were discovered in many directions which werenot hitherto known, except in countries concerned and which can be concertedof munitions production.3. A group spirit was established of mutual co-operation and collaboration,and it was the feeling of all concerned that, if various Governments accepted therecommendations of the Conference, it only required prompt establishment of the requisite machine as recommended for an Eastern Group Supply Council, tosecure an abundant output of munitions east and south of the Suez.4. When Mission interviewed General Smuts in South Africa, he expressedthe hope that Supply Council would be stationed in South Africa. Conference,however, unanimously agreed that India presented a more logical centre. It isclear that recommendations of the Conference generally, and particularly theformation of Supply Council, will be recommended by the various delegations for acceptance by their various Governments.5. Mission desires to make the following comments on the more important decisions of the Conference : -(a) We strongly recommend of His Majesty&apos;s Government that supply council be formed without delay on the lines recommended by the Conference, andthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should, if they share this view, immediatelyannounce their agreement in principle to participants in the Conference.(b) We would urge that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government agrees to participate in Supply Council, arrangements should be made for immediate despatch of their representative to arrive in India by the 15th January to represent UnitedKingdom on Supply Council. As stated in report of Conference, members ofSupply Council should be men of the highest standing and ability, enjoying full confidence of Government appointing them. Work of Supply Council will, in ouropinion, largely depend on active co-operation of Great Britain, and (corruptgroup) arrangements should be made for speedy decisions by United kingdom with regard to provision of necessary finance, machinery and skilled technical personnel by United Kingdom.(c) We gather that Australia intends, if Government decides to participate,to send an outstanding leader and 5 or 6 strong (omission) men as their repre-sentatives, and without doubt other countries will follow this example in varyingdegree, thus using valuable experience and contacts gained at Conference. Wesuggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt a similar policy and that united Kingdom representative and his staff should not be put in position of having to break new grounds. We therefore recommend that certain of personscomposing Mission should be attached to United Kingdom representative on supply Council. If you agree to this suggestion in principle I will explorequestion with Mission in order to ascertain who would be available and willingto undertake task.(d) It is vitally necessary for utmost speed to be achieved and for existingexperience and contacts and friendships, technical, commercial and official,already established over past weeks, to be used to full.(e) One of the most important features which we would advocate in regardto Supply Council is that there should be sufficient expert staff to enablecontinuous personal contact to be maintained between various countries in eastern group for the purpose of standardisation and speedy co-ordinated planning in
legevery direction. This would be materially helped by recourse under (c) withregard particularly to technical side of Mission, and much time would be lost ifthese valuable contacts were broken.(/) The Mission is fully alive to relatively large extent of programme now considered desirable by Conference as a target, and in this connection the Missionwould draw special attention of Ministry of Supply to following note of warningcontained on page 2 of Volume 1 of Report of Conference : &quot; In making suggestions about possible allocation to countries of extraproductive capacity for some of more important armament items which arein deficit, the Conference desires to emphasise that productive capacityenvisaged is additional to present planned capacity within group, and thatachievement of even present planned capacity is dependent on a high prioritybeing given by His Majesty&apos;s Government in United Kingdom to provisionof necessary plant, generators, machine tools, &amp;c, and on necessary skilled and supervisory personnel being made available. The allocations now suggested are absolutely dependent on plant and personnel, both for planning and production being made available by His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, and Conference desires to bring importance of thesequestions to notice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.It is specially desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom to consider afresh the advisability and practicability of transferring complete plants, with their personnel, to Eastern Groupcountries. The Conference also recommend countries for which establishmentof additional productive capacity is suggested should at once explorepracticability of these suggestions as far as they themselves are concerned,and advise Supply Council as early as possible whether suggestions arefeasible, what assistance is required from Supply Council to implement them,and when increased production can be established.&quot;(g) Australia is well organised and is &quot; all out &quot; on an immense effort. Itis willing to go further, provided that observations in the foregoing paragraphare agreed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is further prepared to accept menfrom New Zealand for training in Australian munitions factories so that NewZealand, in its turn, can develop maximum possible effort. New Zealand hascertain engineering capacity and skilled labour not fully utilised. They are,furthermore, faced with the possibilities of considerable unemployment. SouthAfrica is already embarked on munitions production on an increasing scale, witha fine scheme of organisation and a personnel which is selected from the bestbusiness organisations in the country. Indian delegation unanimously acceptedConference report, and has recommended its acceptance to the Government ofIndia, which, we have no doubt, will energetically pursue policy recommended in it. It is the opinion of the Mission that the programme, big as it is, can be largely achieved with proper direction and co-ordination and help from HisMajesty&apos;s Government already outlined.(h) Mission, however, wishes to know, both from the point of view ofco-ordinated Group effort and from that of advice which it is trying to giveIndia, on Indian production possibilities, what are the answers to the two following questions: (1) Does stipulation in our terms of reference of the9th August, 1940, still apply to-day, namely, that we should have regard primarily to possible action which can be reasonably estimated to achieve substantial resultsby the middle of 1942 at the latest? (2) Does present position and prospects ofair and shipping war so seriously affect production in the United Kingdom andfurnishing of supplies by the United Kingdom to Eastern Group as to make itnecessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider a transfer of plants for munitions production of various kinds to Eastern Group countries. A declarationof policy on these two important points would have a profound effect on our deliberations and formulation of our advice, and we would again draw attentionto the Conference warning which we have quoted in 5 (/).6. To turn now to the activities of the Mission up to date and its plans forthe immediate future. While being of the greatest value to Mission and to India,the work of the Conference slowed down the immediate work of the Mission asparticularly applied to India, since practically the whole Mission was occupied in connection with Conference throughout its entire Session. Many of theMission members were appointed members of Committees, and in several, such asarmaments, metals, armoured fighting vehicles, explosives, scientific and signalstores, textiles, (1 inventor)s Reviewing Committee and Allocation Committee,
the Chairmen were drawn from the Mission. In addition, the Mission wasconsulted by various delegations on technical training, machine tools, gauges,machine production, size and layout of new factories, numbers and types of staff,technical supervision, while South Africa, for example, has asked for estimates of cost of new factories, size of factories, machine tools required and provisionof drawings.7. Before Conference started, the Mission was able between the date of itsarrival at Bombay on the 19th September and the start of Conference on the25th October to make general survey of a considerable part of India, includingthe more important plants. In addition, the discussion of certain questions ofimportant principle was undertaken with Viceroy and heads of delegations, andconsultations have continued to take place even during the Conference betweenMission and various officials of Supply Department on a wide range of subjects.8. It is now proposed that munitions production side of Mission should gothis week to Calcutta in order to plan, with Director-General of munitions production, programmes with reference to new factories, expansion, &amp;c,connected with engineering stores, tank armoured vehicles, gun and shellprogramme, scientific stores, explosives and S.A.A., aluminium production, jigs,tools and gauges, fuse production, and many ancillary subjects. If arrangementsproceed according to plan, initial reports should begin to. be available in two orthree weeks&apos; time and thereafter progressively until the middle or end of January.The same holds good in the case of general stores, which are subject of discussion in Delhi. It is hoped that these initial reports will enable schemes of expansionof production to be put in hand without delay.9. In addition to the above work on production problems affecting particularproducts, discussions are taking place on broader aspects of how best to achievesatisfactory industrial planning, technical training, machine tool control, areaorganisation, breaking down of contracts, &amp;c.10. Some of the Mission will pay visits to parts of British India not yetvisited and to various Indian States with a view to exploring further possibilitiesof new production.11. I trust that you will approve of action we are taking, which is designed as an intensive effort to stimulate Indian production and to ascertain allpossibilities for increasing it.12. We would ask, however, for your guidance and instruction on thefollowing question. It has been suggested by delegations from Australia, NewZealand, Hong Kong, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya and South Africa that at least some of the Mission should visit their countries at an early date for further exploration and consultation.We feel that it is essential to concentrate on the Indian problem in the firstplace, and not to risk delaying matters by weakening the efforts of the mission in India by sending parties away at once.We would point out, however, that Australia has established a much widerproduction of machine tools, presses and complete Q.F. cartridge motor plantthan was known of before this conference, and they say that they may be able togive delivery of many of these in six to eight months&apos; time.New Zealand, as a result of consultation with the Mission, is consideringpossibility of erecting three fuse factories. Problem of fuse production in india is serious, and we are of opinion that only a partial solution is possible in India.Hong Kong believes that, given drawings, they could in three or four months&apos; time produce a useful contribution in the shape of presses and simplemachine tools.In view of these possibilities, we consider that technical representatives ofthe Mission should visit these three countries as soon as they can be spared. Inthe case of Hong Kong we ask your authority to despatch two or three forthwith,who will be absent about a fortnight.As regards Australia and New Zealand, our proposals would probably be ofthe nature of sending some six persons, who would be absent from India for about six weeks. We would prefer, however, to be more concrete in regard to a visit to these two countries after we have studied situation in Calcutta.With regard to South Africa, we hope that Mission or a part of it will beable to visit that country on way home. Before that it may prove desirable forStrickland, our explosive expert, to visit Africa, and we would ask your authorityto send him if we consider it necessary.With regard to other countries mentioned, we feel that a decision as to possible visits should be postponed until we see how our plans develop.
