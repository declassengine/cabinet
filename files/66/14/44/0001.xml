A,; Q.5TH F: BRUAPY .  1941.V7AR cabinet.ANTI-GAS PRECAUTIONS.Report by the Lord Privy 3eal.At their meeting held on the 27th January last(W.M.10(41)6), the \Ar Cabinet invited me, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, to examine our precautionary measures against gas attack and to concert such measures as might be necessary to bring them to a state of readiness,I now submit to the   -ur Gubinet the following report ,The information furnished Toy the Departments showsthat generally speaking the preparations against gas attackare satisfactory.      The following points have emerged inin the course of my examination.      I he-ve discussed - them .with the Ministers of Home Security and Health and indicate the measures which have &quot;been concerted,Io  Publicity.Long immunity from this form of attack has le 6. -1 o acertain amount of carelessness on the part of the general public in carrying out recommended precautionary measures9while a desire not to raise unnecessary scares has led to apolicy oi avoiding publicity.      If the service is to be keyedup, there must be a carefully devised campaign ofincreasing publicity designed to familiarise the publicwithout .1 arming them.      This might.tie 11. be combined withthe campaign designed to make the people invasion conscious.Gas attack should be treaced not as something separate andabnormal but as a measurable danger and a likely pant ofthe ene;iiy&apos;s war effort.      Stress should be laid on theresponsibility of the individual to play his part in -defeating the attack and dealing with its incidence.      The^Ministry of Information is already taking steps towards thisend.2. Concentrated attack.It was never envisaged as a -arc of the generalcivil defence plans that each area weald have sufficientresources of its own to deal with a concentrated attack,and for this reason schemes of mutual support between one area and another have been an essential feature of thecivil defence arrangements.      These arrangements havestood the tost of actual experience so far as theother-civil de-fencxe services .ar e concerned.

In key areas such as the docks there are arr angeuen t s fcs?co-operation between the dock authorities and the localauthority, and in addition support can be provided fromother authorities in the Region.    I have advised thatthere should &quot;be a review of the adequacy of thearrangements to meet ... concentrated&quot;attack on the scalenow estimated to be possible on a number of such keyareas, and also on nodal points of communication in rural areas.   Consideration is being given to the holding ofa practice exercise in one or more areas..    I have suggested to the Ministers that they should examine the need forprovision of special mobile units, for reinforcement in emergency in those Regions where the existing arrangementsfor mutual support might not meet the circumstances^of theRegiona3.    Co-ordination *Several ministries are necessarily concerned in anti-gas precautions.    Close liaison is necessary not only at Whitehall but in the regions.,    It is essential that responsibility should be allocated unambiguously.    This is best done through the Regional Com Issioners.    The fightingServices are generally self sufficient, but there should be close liaison between them and the Regional commissioners and local authorities.    It is possible that small detachedbodies of troops are relying on local authorities fordecontamination of clothing.Responsibility for the travelling public at stationshas been placed on the local authority not the railwayCompany..    I have asked for inquiries to be made to see whetherthe local authorities have recognised this responsibility and made adequate preparations in respect of large stationssuch as the London termini,4.    Factories and Public .Utility Service^oThe responsible departments have issued circularscalling upon those concerned to bring their precautions upto date and to report on action taken.    Some follow upaction is needed to see that instructions have in fact beencarried out.    In -uiries are to be made to see that localauthorities knew which firms in their areas have providedfirst aid and cleansing stations and decontamination stations.The reports from the Supply departments indicate that thereare firms which have not male provision and these should be checked up.5*    Cleansinr; and Decontamin tion Arrangements *Cleansing facilities for the general nubile.,Arrangements have been made to deal with those who arewounded as&quot;well as contaminated in hospitals and first aidposts.   There are for instance some 400 such posts in theLondon Region each capable when their.equipment is completeof dealing with 300 cases an hour.    In Scotland there are260 first-aid posts with cleansing stations attached.

9 P KEdinburgh, has .99 posts which could deal with a total of1,100 cases an hour.      The provision, made for cleansingstations both in England and //ales and in Scotland, is tobe reviewed in the light of an. up to date appreciation ofthe scale of attack to he expected;.      I have asked theMinister of Health to consider whether in the interests ofdispersal and for the prevention of queues all hospitals should be made available to contaminated persons whetherwounded or not and whether gas proof wards or sectionsshould be set aside.Even, however, if the number of cleansing stationsis so increased they cannot deal with more than a proportion of the unbounded contaminated.     Provision ismade in public baths and wash houses, and at other buildingsearmarked for the purpose but in the mains people will haveto rely on washing facilities in their own or neighbourshouses.     More detailed arrangements should and could bemade when the publicity campaign is under way.    In view ofthe risk of mains being fractured emergency reserves of waterin tanks should be provided.      The Minister of Health has issued instructions on this to local authorities^It is essential  that a short and simple leafletdealing with plans for cleansing should be issued before any gas attack takes place.      The Ministers concerned have one in preparation,6. Decontamination of Clothing.This is to be undertaken mainly by the laundries.Negotiations with the industry produced difficulties butit is hoped tnat these have now been overcome.     arrangements have been made for the issue of large numbers of standardsuits to those whose clothes have been destroyed.7. Personnel,It should be understood that anti-gas personnel isas important for winning the war as are soldiers or sailors.It is sheer waste at this time to take a trained anti-gasworker and turn him into an untrained recruit,      There isa danger of a shortage in some categories such as stretcherbearers in hospitals and rescue parties.      I suggest thatanti-gas work should   have as high a priority as that ofthe fighting services a     The staff for decontamination of roads and buildings is at present mainly recruited from thecleansing departments of the local authorities.      Iunderstand that in some areas Rescue Parties whose workcannot begin before contamination has taken place havealso been trained in decontamination duties, and that this,practice is being made general.      I advise that this lineof action should Te actively pursued.8. Materials,The supply of materials seems generally adeq. late,although there is some shortage of service respirators forthe fighting services and a considerable shortage oftarpaulins for covering food stores etc.

9. Gas Masks,The habit of carrying gas masks needs reviving.I suggest for consideration, to be carried out as soon aspublicity hr,s gone far enough, the setting aside of adefinite time, perhaps a Sunday afternoon when every person should be enjoined co wea-r a gas mask for sayten minutes. I understand that arrangements havealready been made for the issue over the wireless,whenever attack seems really imminent, of an order bythe Government that all gas masks should be carried.Local authorities are arranging for a fu. ther inspection.( In mi. ) G. 71.
