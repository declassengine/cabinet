ccVMOST SECRET.W.P.(40)475.6TH DECEMBER.  1940.COPY BCU *s*\WAR CABINET.PAYMENTS TO EIRE,,The attached minute by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer is circulated to the War Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister,(Signed)    E.E, BRIDGES.Secretary,War Cabinet,Richmond Terrace,6TH DECEMBER,  1940*TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.

ISPRIME MINISTER,In accordance with your request, I have discussed with the President of the Board of Trade, the Ministers ofShipping, Agriculture and Pood and the Secretary of Statefor the Dominions, the measures which might be taken toreduce the burden on our-shipping and finances inconsequence of the heavy sinkings off the Irish coast andour inability to use the Irish ports,,I describe below two plans, the second more drasticthan the first, both of which could be put into effective action as soon as it was decided to proceed.    Both would hitEire considerably worse than- ourselves,,    An estimate of thequickness of the results on Eire is given with the plans.The first plan would,  apart from one or two items,- rest on the argument that so long as we are subject to difficulties in the supply of certain things we cannot inpresent circumstances go on giving Eire the generous shareof them that we have so far allowed here      The items inthis plan would be as fellows:-Shipso There is at present an unwritten understandingthat Eire charters ships through the Minister,of Shipping?s Charter 0fficeo      In additionEire gets shipping space in liners and other ships chartered to us,  the cargoes being inthe main trans-shipped in the United KingdorruEire&apos;s needs in both kinds of shipping spaceput together are estimated at the equivalent of 40 whole-time ships0     Owing to thereduction in our own arrivals, Eire has beenfeeling short of the second kind of shipping space and the Ministry of Shipping has hadserai&quot;Official notice of this from Eire officials.But there is no sign yet of a Ministerialapproach which the Eire officials have been toldis the only one that would be considered^   Wedo not think it would be enough to wait forsuch an approach and we think that on the firstplan a notification should be given by our officials to Eire&apos;s that the unwritten under-standing referred to above can no longer be observed,,      The Minister of Shipping&apos;s CharterOffice would   no longer give facilities to Eire,The Ministry of Shipping would tell the greeks and.the Norwegians that in present circumstancesthey should not charter ships except to Alliesor co-operators,.      The result would be (on theassumption which the Minister of Shipping hopeswill shortly be fulfilled, that he gets all theGreek    and the remaining free Norwegian tonnageon time charter) that Eire might get if she were-?ery lucky, 10 ships, which would give her25 per cent,, of her needs.

u 0g^mmoditiesr Tn.ts Export Licensing arrangements shouldbe altered so as to shut out the export or re-export to Eire of food, feeding-stuffs and fertilisers,  agricultural and other machinery,spare parts of all kinds,  iron and steel, non-ferrous netals, chemical and electrical goods,paper and cardboard.      Small exceptions mightbe made, for instance in the case of tea onwhich the Irish could be cut to something belowthe English ration.      This would deprive Eirealmost entirely of space in ships bringinggoods to the United Kingdom.Goal.    Eire takes some 3 million tons a year which employssome 10000 men.    About one-fifth comes from south Wales.      As in the case of cotton-piecegoods and other textiles, leather manufacturersetc.,  in which there Is an export drive, we shallnot have the same ground for starving Eire as inthe commodities previously mentioned.Dollars. Eire at present exercises an exchange controlfairly well in line with ours and we allot themdollars for sterling.     We could cease to do so and then Eire&apos;s control would get out of line with ours and in order to stop a drain on our.gold (since Mr.  de Valera might buy things inthe United States of America which he could notship to spite us) we might have to freeze herbalances of sterling.      This freezing woulddislocate Eire&apos;s imports including the exporttrade in cotton textiles etc.  (see above) from great Britain and Northern Ireland.     We shouldbe treating Sire in very much the same way asRumania,,      This would Inevitably lead on to thesecond plan.      Dollars might perhaps be left outof the first plan on the ground that theirconnection with our difficulties with Eireis not so close as that of the other items, butit woul(Improbably be dangerous for us to leave,them out.Effect of the plan on Eire. The Eire Government would immediately feel difficulties because they would see their future supplies of feeding-stuffs, food and if we took action on it coal endangered.    on food we have no precise information about stocks,except that those of sugar are probably high, butthe population would probably begin to feeluncomfortable in a few weeks.      On feeding-stuffs. ^ the Government would almost certainly have toimpose a rationing scheme without delay and thesmall farmers would feel an Immediate pinch.    on coal the population generally would be affectedin the sane way but there are probablysubstantial stocks,.OjLl.  Eire&apos; s. requirements could be met by the full timeuse of a single tanker which she might &quot;be able to get.

a?Effect on us0 The only serious effect on us would be felt possibly on our gold (see above) and certainly by the coal-miners in South Wales;the other coal districts supplying Eire wouldnot suffer substantiallyw     We could not onthis plan consistently refuse to take importsof food from Eire and there might be a glut ofimports of livestock which might causedifficulties at the ports, slaughter-houses and cold stores; but as the Minister of Poodis the sole buyer, these difficulties couldbe thrown back on the Eire farmer and thusgreatly enhance the efficiency of the plan.The second plan would be in effect economic war.    TheMinister of Shipping could withhold facilities for theinsurance of ships going to Eire and this would mean thatthey would get no ships.     No further action by any other minister would, add to the plan;    but it might be necessaryto refuse convoy to shipments made by sympathisers in theUnited States.The effect on Eire would be the same as described above in a more drastic form, but the psychological effect would of course be much greater.The effect on us would be as follows.     We should lose exports of some  24 million a year but these exports are in the same currency, and except for coal already mentioned,  the short-term economic effect on us would notbe serious:    the Minister of Food would not be embarrassed.Eire might  expropriate Guinness and the National Stud.For bacon we have a contract to purchase which isterminable at two weeks&apos; notice on either side.     We shouldnot mind if Eire gave notice.      On our side it has beenthe practice to make import restrictions over-ride existing contracts.(Intld.)
