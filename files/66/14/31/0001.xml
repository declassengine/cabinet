(41) 24.)January 15, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.VIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ORGANISATION OF ALLIED NAVAL, ARMY AND air contingents.Thirteenth Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.IN accordance with the Prime Ministers instructions, we submit thefollowing report for the month of December 1940 on the organisation of allied naval, Army and Air Contingents.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.J. G. DILL.C. PORTAL.Great George Street, S.W.1,January 15, 1941.A.-FRENCH,(i) Navy.Free French Naval Forces.DURING the month the Moqueuse and the Vaillant have been reduced tocare and maintenance parties.The submarine Narval was lost by enemy action in the Mediterranean.2. A steady, though small, stream of transfers continues from the&apos;R.N. tothe F.N.F.L., and in a lesser degree to the Free French Mercantile Marine.Two courses of instruction have been arranged for ratings in Torpedo Duties,and the first is now commencing in H.M.S. Vernon. A few Free French officers will shortly undergo a Submarine Course in H.M.S. Dolphin.3. A certain number of young Frenchmen, who are at present training tobecome Naval Officers, will be admitted to R.N. College, Dartmouth, for two[22105] b
terms. A selection of those with the best knowledge of English is in progress forthe first entry, and the others will be called on to study the language and enter the R.N. College a term later.4. It is interesting to note that some of the crew of the Erench SubmarineAjax who were taken prisoners at Dakar have come to this country and joined the F.N.F.L. A party of 34 ratings has arrived from Alexandria to join the F.N.F.L.Morale and Discipline.5. Plymouth.- Morale and discipline remain low on the whole, but marked improvement has been shown by some. Progress under training is generally satisfactory. Difficulty was experienced with the crew of the Submarine Junon,and a number of ratings were removed from her.French libertymen are still the least popular of our Allies, but there appearsto be an improvement in this respect.6. Portsmouth. A number of ratings in the Courbet are under punishment,but it is thought their lack of discipline is largely due to inactivity and thesituation will improve if they are sent to Equatorial Africa.Morale is still considered to be good, and the general feeling of optimismimproved by successes in Africa.   Discipline remains satisfactory.The Chasseurs employed on Local Defence and convoy duties have carried onsatisfactorily.7. Rosyth. At Dundee the very friendly relations with our own ratings arecommented on.8. General. The low morale remarked on by Plymouth is not borne out by many of the letters written by officers and ratings to their families and friends inFrance.  Some extracts are given in Annex I.On the other hand, the less loyal and keen men are no doubt well aware ofthe censorship and deliberately refrain from expressing their true sentiments.R.N. French.9. Plymouth. The morale is reported to be very good and the discipline tobe improving.News of British successes in Africa have been received with delight. Therecent changes in the Petain Cabinet have had a mixed reception, but bothFlandin and Laval are regarded unfavourably.Four R.N. French ratings who were serving in French Submarine Narval in mediterranean were removed in November and are being sent to the UnitedKingdom, the report stating that they lacked both discipline and efficiency to sucha degree that their loyalty appears to be in doubt.10.   Portsmouth. Discipline and morale are reported to be very good.One French rating who applied to transfer to the F.N.F.L. gave as his reason that British Officers lacked confidence in French ratings, even those of experience.He also remarked on the severity of the discipline, which is probably his realreason.11. The Nore. There are only 1 officer and 9 men in Chatham Barracks, allR.N., and no particular remarks apply.(ii) Army.Free French Forces.12.   Strength.

Pay. As a result.of negotiations between War Office representatives andthe Polish authorities, an agreement has been reached by which the polish authorities receive from British funds a credit of  3,500,000 a year based ontheir existing strength, both in this country and the Middle East, to meet allcash disbursements on their land forces. In addition the War Office have paid the Polish authorities  220,000 to settle all arrears and outstanding claims inrespect of the Polish Army up to the 31st. December, 1940. In consequence ofthis agreement which came into force on the 1st January, 1941, the Poles will beresponsible for the pay and allowances of their troops. A further sum is to beadded to cover increases in the Polish strength approved by the General Staff.Similarly, the amount of the credit will be reducible by a figure to be negotiatedin respect of each officer and soldier by which the average strength of the Polishland forces is less than the number originally agreed.The credit agreement does not affect the arrangements for the provision of stores, supplies, equipment and services in kind. These will continue to besupplied, so far as they are available, to Polish forces on the same basis as foe comparable British units, except where special scales for Polish troops have been authorised.(iii) Air Force.16. Operations. There have been no operations by Polish bomber squadronsduring the month. All five Polish fighter squadrons were engaged between the21st November and the 20th December and made 343 sorties, probably destroyingone enemy aircraft.Service in the R.A .F. Between 70 and 80 Polish pilots are serving in R .A.F.fighter squadrons.Re-equipment. All four Polish bomber squadrons previously equipped withBattles have now received the full establishment of 16 Wellingtons, but as theirpersonnel is not yet at full strength, they are for operational purposes at half-strength.Training. Progress has been made in the formation of the R.A.F. (No. 1Polish) Flying Training School and of the Bomber Operational Training Unit atBramcote, which is being reserved for the Poles, but active training has not yetbegun.A number of Poles have been sent to Flying Instructor, Link TrainerInstructor and Astronomical Air Navigation courses.Three hundred and forty-six air personnel and 166 ground personnel were receiving elementary ground training at Blackpool during the month.Inspection.- The President of the Polish Republic visited the RA.F.

The refit of the Heemskerck is progressing and the menare reported to be contented.19. The Nore. Reports of high morale are still received, but it was reported from an unorthodox source that discontent exists over the retention of a partof the men&apos;s pay; and that they feel they may not receive it as promised afterthe war.A series of football matches were arranged by the Royal Air Force andalthough the Dutch were beaten the contact has been very beneficial.(ii) Army.20.

A Czechoslovak pilot damaged one enemy aircraft and, with a R.A.F.pilot, destroyed another on the 17th November (this success had not been previously reported).Training.- Eight Czech pupil pilots have been sent to a Service flying training School. Insufficient knowledge of English prevented more being sentand efforts are being made to accelerate the teaching of English.E. NORWEGIANS,(i) Navy.24. Both Skegness and Port Edgar report favourably on morale and discipline. At the latter port 20 Cadet ratings are undergoing a special course for promotion to Sub-Lieutenant.A report was received from the British Liaison Officer of the Patrol VesselFridtjof Nansen, recently sunk off Iceland, to the effect that discipline was verypoor and in marked contrast to that of Norwegian men who had undergone acourse of training in one of our establishments. Part of this crew have since been sent to Port Edgar for gunnery training, and it is confidently expected thattheir standard will greatly improve.The Norwegians will shortly man two Town Class Destroyers.Some Norwegian Officers and men have now completed A/S and SignalCourses.Plymouth report satisfactorily on morale and discipline, and say a morecheerful disposition is evident.About 400 Norwegians are serving in Royal Naval Patrol Service, themajority being engine room ratings. Their discipline is not up to naval standard.This, -however, is not surprising, as they have had no training, having been[22105] b 3
enlisted and sent to sea as quickly as possible owing to the scarcity of british personnel capable of handling diesel engines.On the other hand, Norwegian mercantile seamen, sent to Royal A rthur to be trained by us for the Norwegian Navy, have quickly reached a very fair standardof discipline and good morale.(ii) Army.25.

(iii) Air Force.29.   Operations. Thirteen Belgians have been serving in R.A.F. squadrons.Training. Eighty-one Belgians are being trained at R.A.F. Elementaryand Service Flying Training Schools and at the French-Belgian Air training school at Odiham.G. GENERAL.30. Welfare. This covers Allied Naval personnel, merchant seamen andfishermen.Arrangements have been made under which the Naval Officer i/c or P.A.L.O.in each port furthers the welfare of these Allies in addition to that of R.N.personnel. For this purpose close co-operation has been established between theNaval Assistant (F) to Second Sea Lord and various Naval bases, local committees,institutions, &amp;c.Close co-operation also exists between the Naval i^ssistant (F) to SecondSea Lord and the Ministry of Shipping, Bessbbrough Committee, Seamen&apos;sWelfare Board, British Council, Representative Council of Seamen&apos;s missions and Sailors&apos; Homes, Overseas League and many other institutions and people,including the welfare organisations of individual Allied nations.During the past few months over 20 ports have been visited (some more than once) in order to co-ordinate and assist local efforts, explain policy to theNaval Officers i/c, smooth off rough edges and generally assist. considerable progress has been made in most of these ports.31. Lady James was assisted in the formation and maintenance of herAllied Seamen&apos;s Club at Portsmouth. At the instigation of the NavalAssistant (F) to Second Sea Lord, the British Committee for the French red cross provided at their own expense *a lady worker for this club, who has proved most successful.Attention has been paid to the co-ordination of hospitality and entertainmentfor Allied naval officers and ratings when on leave. A relevant Admiralty FleetOrder has been drafted, and the Dutch, Norwegian and Polish Admirals have beennotified.Christmas parcels were distributed to Allied Naval personnel at approxi-mately 30 ports.The welfare of Allied and Danish fishermen has been furthered at 5 ports.In one port the welfare of these men had been completely neglected. In anotherport existing welfare arrangements were extended and efforts made to stop theactivities of undesirable clubs. As far as practicable, the importance of their work to the general war effort has been explained to all concerned, and arrange-ments have been started to educate the general public up to the great value ofour Allies naval, mercantile and fishery to the Common Cause.The foregoing is merely a broad outline of Naval Assistant (F) to SecondSea Lord&apos;s welfare work.  Many other factors are involved.32. Comparison of Allied Navies.-The Report from Captain (S), 9thFlotilla, is of special interest, and extracts form the subject of Annex II.

I have the D.S.M. We arevery well paid;  17 per month. The English are very very good to us. The free french Navy is growing; in a few months we shall have a real fleet.&quot;
9190ANNEX II.THAT the morale of all Allied forces at Dundee (Free French, netherlands and Polish) is high was well demonstrated on Christmas Day by the decorationof mess decks and living spaces, and the cheerfulness, good humour andcamaraderie between all nationalities. This has been particularly noticeablethroughout the preceding months, and is evinced at the Sunday night broadcasts,when everybody sings everybody else&apos;s National Anthems.It has been interesting to note in the past the general relationships betweenratings of four so temperamentally varied nationalities. From the point of viewof the British sailors, the Poles are regarded as being the pleasantest associateseither as mess mates or to work with. The French in general have not beenhighly regarded, but this statement must be qualified in the case of the particularratings now attached to this establishment, with whom we have been constantlyassociated since April. By their record of achievement and exemplary bearingfollowing the French surrender, they have won a place in the esteem andadmiration of the British forces here which can only be described as unique.There is great friendship between the French and the Poles, which is not entirelyaccounted for by the fact that these two nationalities are represented by smallernumbers than are the British and Netherlands.While the Dutch are admired and respected, they are not really liked by anyof the other three nationalities. This is probably accounted for by their nationalcharacter, which can only be described as distinctly Teutonic. They areunquestionably pleasant mess mates, but are difficult to work with. They provide an extraordinary mixture of great efficiency combined with leaving certain things to chance, which can only be described as slapdash. This applies both in mattersof materiel and personnel. They have, in fact, to be closely watched and assisted in what we normally consider purely routine matters of health and materialupkeep of their craft.
