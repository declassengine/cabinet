ENCLOSURE......   &quot; 1 S3nlD^ memoir &quot;J for the COMMITTEE&quot;on u;S r&quot; basec,COMMAND IN territories IN WHICH BOTHthe&quot; UNitejt&apos;state3 AND ourselves WILLhj\ve&quot;mutual defence INTERESTS.It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat British sovereignty is to remain unimpaired inthe territories in which areas are to be leased forde;f&amp;nce purposes to the United States,3. The ultimate command will therefore rest, as inthe case of all other British colonies? with the BritishGovernor and Commander-In-Chiefas-3, The Governor and Commander-in-Chief should he responsible? in consultation with the Senior British and united States Commanders in his territory for the&apos;preparatidn of a defence scheme for the co-ordinationof the defence arrangements of the territorya4* This scheme should include provision for a singlemilitary commander, who may he either a British or an american officer, to assume control of the combined forces under the Governor.,  in the event of a threat to thesecurity of the territory.     It should also&apos; include provision for the disposition of the combined forces,5. These defence schemes should he  submitted forapproval to the United States Government and to theBritish or Dominion government concerned,6. The condition of  &quot;threat to the security of theterritory&quot; on which military control is assumed by asingle military Commander (see paragraph 4)  should be declared &quot;by the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of theterritory? prior approval of both Governments being obtained if time permits,7. Should the United States Delegation, whilstaccepting the principle cf British sovereignty and thenecessity of unified command;,  object to the above arrange- .ment on the grounds that it places American forces underthe orders of a British officer, you may agree to asolution on the following lines:-Although the Governor and Commander-in-Chief asrepresentative    of British sovereignty must retain finalresponsibility for the command of the territory, theofficer commanding the United States forces in that territory should retain the right of appeal to the UnitedStates Government in the last resort.Similarly, the British Commander,  if subordinate to an &quot;American officer in any territory,  would have theright of appeal to the Governor and Commander-in-Chief ofthat territory,,3     In the case of Jamaica,   Captain-Generaland Governor-in-Chief.

8.        With reference to the question of command in \individual&apos; defence schemes, we consider.that in Bermuda&quot;the single military commander (referred to in paragraph above) should be British as in this island we have animportant strategic interest in our naval base and a regular garrison.    Furthermore the lease of base facilities in Bermuda was offered as a free gift to the U.S.9.        In Trinidad, Antigua. st  Lucia, British G-uiana andthe Bahamas, the United States defence commitments willpredominate, and the single military commander referred toin paragraph. 4 above may be American.-&quot; *  :&apos;10,        In the case of Jamaica, United States forces willnot be in any great preponderance. The island is of strategivalue to us as a subsidiary defended naval base and wemaintain a regular garrison there.    We should thereforeprefer that the single military commander he British.11.      In Newfoundland, American forces will largelypredominate.-,    Nevertheless her political status requires that the question of command he given the most carefulconsiderationsThe island is at present governed by a Commission,which is not a representative body.    Any decision which istaken now must be considered in the light of its reception&quot;by a representative government when Newfoundland regains herstatus of self-governing dominion.Further, Canada has undertaken by agreement with theUnited States the responsibility for the defence of the island; the Imperial garrison is at present entirelyCanadian; and Canada may well view with concern theappointment of an American officer to the military command of a territory which ferms part of the local defence ofCanada itself.Finally* it should he borne in mind that the lease ofbase facilities in Newfoundland has, as in the case ofBermuda, been offered as a gift to the United States.We therefore consider it essential that the singlemilitary commander in Newfoundland he either Canadian or british,,
