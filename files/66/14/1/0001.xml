;/-raft Telegram, toLord Lothian,December, 19k00IlilE DIATE,Your tel. Non 2837  &quot;of 29th November: ^Norman Davis&apos;proposal for food relief to unoccupied FranceJ/. .We have given the most careful consideration to Mr.Davis&apos;s proposal but we feel that its acceptance wouldinvolve us in serious difficulty-(a) We do not feel at all confident that distinctionbetween unoccupied and occupied territory couldbe maintained;;(b) People would inevitably feel that if it was rightto do this for French children it -was not lessright to do something under, due safeguards for children say in Plolland, Belgium, Poland orNorway, which countries have established a gooddeal stronger claims on our sympathy than France..(c) This would open the door to a dangerous weakening of blockade3 having effect of prolonging the war,which we could not contemplate.(d) The reception by Parliament and public opinionhere of action proposed would certainly be hostile,,2. We do not think the Davis scheme is necessarilyimpracticable in itself, but we are not really convinced thatfeeling in the United States is sufficiently strong orwidespread to compel us to adopt it0      The impression which you gave us while you were here and our reading of thematerial that has reached us from the United States in the past2 months incline us to think that the major part, of American opinion remains more concerned not to interfere with theBritish war effort than to salve its humanitarian conscience.We should accordingly like you to put this quite frankly tothe Presidento3-. As regards lur. Norman Davis, I suggest you should tell him that His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted his proposal with interest and that they sympathise with the motives whichfasewe inspired it.      But the present course of the war, notably the heavy loss of civilian lives in this country byindiscriminate air attack rendered more effective by thedefection of Prance, and the cuts in rationing made ncessaryby the demands of our own armaments programme would make itdifficult for us to justify to our public any concession ofthis kind at this moment 0      In the grim ordeal through whichthey are at present passing,  our people cannot be expected to look kindly on special concessions to a ,people who, by theircapitulation, have .immeasurably increased the power of theenemy to strike at us and have left us to face the menace alone.They would be conscious that such concessions could hardly fail to be of indirect benefit to the enemy.

k* -.&apos;e hope that you will he able to hold the position with Mro Davis on some such lines as these until you are able to see the President.     We are not convinced that thelatter as yet fully realizes the strength of the arguments ifavour of vigorously maintaining the blockade of VichyPrance as well as all enemy occupied territory.     We r-elyon you to take every opportunity&quot;&quot; of putting our case to him as forcibly as you can.
