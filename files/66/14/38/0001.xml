(41) 54) january, 22, 1941.:TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KBY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET/Copy No.WEEKLY RESUME(No. 73)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR SITUATION - %from 12 noon January 16th, to12 noon January 2&amp;*4, H%*d1941-^[Circulated, with R./the approval of the  Chiefs of Staff.] i5
naval SITUATION.General Review.A greater number of U-boats has been operating against our shipping in the atlantic, but there has been no increase in the number of ships sunk.Units of the Mediterranean Fleet have maintained supplies to the Army intheir advance in Libya, and carried out a bombardment of Tobruk prior to the attack.Enemy raiders have attacked shipping in the Central Atlantic and in theSouthern Ocean.Home Waters.2. Units of the Home Fleet have carried out sweeps from Scapa and fromPlymouth without making contact with the enemy.HM. Destroyer Woolston escorting a coastal convoy sighted three enemy&quot; E &quot; boats off Harwich on the 16th and drove them off before they could attack the convoy.HM. Corvettes Rhododendron and Honeysuckle were damaged by mines offLiverpool on the 17th and 19th respectively, but both reached harbour.In an air raid on Avonmouth on the night of the 16th/17th H.M. OceanBoarding Vessel Arignani was damaged, and on the night of the 17th/18th some damage was done to the dock area at Swansea. Some naval casualties resulted from an air raid on Skegness on the 18th.During this week coastal convoys off the East Coast were unsuccessfully attacked by aircraft on five occasions, and one ship was sunk shortly beforejoining a convoy. Five attacks by aircraft were also made on homeward bound convoys to the north-west and west of Ireland in which three ships were sunk.A coastal convoy was unsuccessfully attacked in the Thames estuary on the18th, and a Channel convoy unsuccessfully shelled off Dover on the night of the18th/19th January.The Shipwash Lightship was bombed and machine-gunned on the 17th, butonly minor damage was caused.Mediterranean.3. H.M. Ships and various light craft have been employed continuouslyin the maintenance of supplies to the Army in the Western Desert, and thewithdrawal of captured material and prisoners. During the period 7th to17th January 35,000 prisoners and many tanks were ferried to Alexandria,bringing the total number of prisoners transported to 54,000. Five hundred tonsof stores were landed daily at Sollum, and the supply of petrol for Hurricaneswas maintained. R.E. stores and ammunition were unloaded at Bardia. Thelatter harbour has been cleared and moorings established. Tugs and lighters werereinforced by those based at Palestine which were worked along the coast underthe cover of and in conjunction with H.M.S. Terror and gunboats, the 19thDivision of Destroyers (Australian), H.M.S. Protector (net layer), minesweepersand anti-submarine motor boats. No opposition was encountered from enemynaval forces, but bombing Avas constant, chiefly at night.On the night of the 20th/21st H.M.S. Terror and gunboats carried out abombardment of Tobruk preliminary to the attack, while destroyers andHM. Submarine Regent patrolled to the westward to prevent communication.The Italian schooner San Diego was sunk and 10 prisoners taken byH.M. Australian Destroyer Vampire.4. H.M. Submarine Parthian reports that she sank a laden 7,000-ton supplyship off Cape Spartivento.5. Enemy aircraft attacked Malta on the 18th, 19th and 21st.H.M.S. Illustrious sustained serious damage from near miss bombs, putting oneengine and one boiler-room out of action, and S.S. Essex (M.T. ship, 11,063 tons)
0 &apos;n nreceived extensive damage and had 15 killed and 23 wounded. Extensive damage was done to the Dockyard area and the city.South Atlantic.6. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Asturias boarded the French S.S.Mendoza (8,199 tons) on the 18th January, 16^ miles off Ponta das CabecudasLight (350 miles S.W. of Rio de Janeiro). The French Captain refused tonavigate his ship so Asturias reinforced her steaming party when outside the50-mile limit and ordered her to Freetown.The 50-mile restriction off the Brazilian Coast has been cancelled. Frenchmeat ships may be intercepted anywhere outside territorial waters except W. ofthe line Cape Santa Maria-San Antonio.H.M.S. Newcastle reports that one of her aircraft crashed on landing on the22nd January and sank; the crew were picked up.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. H.M. Corvette Fleur de Lys made three attacks on a contact on the19th January in the North Channel without visible result. An aircraft sent toassist sighted a U-boat on the surface. The U-boat dived and destroyers andother craft continued the search.Attacks were also made during the week in various positions in the North-Western Approaches by H.M. Destroyers Somali, Legion and Charlestown andthe Corvette.-.Delphinium without definite result. .,The Norwegian tanker Dalfonn, which had lost touch with her convoy in bad weather about 700 miles south of the Azores, reports that she engaged with hergun a U-boat for which a large armed tanker, flying Dutch colours, was apparently acting as: decoy. The Dalfonn escaped unscathed. An unknownBritish freighter, 10 miles away, also saw and engaged the U-boat. .&quot; ^Enemy Intelligence.German. .   ,8. There has been no certain information as to the whereabouts of the,German main units since the air reconnaissance at Kiel on the 9th January,except for the Hipper Class cruiser, which is still in the dry dock at Brest.Reports from various sources have suggested that the battle cruiser Scharnhorst,and Gneisenau may have been off the Norwegian coast on the 29th December andback in Kiel Bay on the 10th January. It is thought that these ships may havebeen carrying out a trial cruise after the long period they have spent in dockyardhands repairing damage.Italian. - ;9. There has been no evidence of the positions of Italian main units during:the period under review, except for an air reconnaissance of Taranto, which showed four cruisers, five destroyers, seven T/Bs. and five fleet auxiliaries inthe port.U-boats.10. A larger force of enemy U-boats than has previously been reported isnow operating against our trade. Throughout the week there have been as many as 15, 5 Italian and 10 German, in the North-Western Approaches.In addition to these, two, one German and one Italian, have been in thenorth-west Africa area. Of these an Italian put in to Puerto de la Luz, LasPalmas, on the 20th January, in a damaged condition. It was said thatthe damage would take seven days to repair, but the latest reports suggest thatthe submarine will sail on the 23rd or 24th January.Air reconnaissance on the 22nd January showed fifteen submarines inBordeaux.[22148] b
Raiders.     . .................. .......11. There has been fresh evidence of enemy raiders during the week. TheBritish tanker British Union has been sunk 600 miles west of the Canaries by araider, probably as an armed merchant cruiser, and perhaps accompanied by aU-boat. There were also indications on the 19th and the 20th January of two enemy ships in the South Atlantic, though there is no evidence yet as to whetherthey were raiders or supply ships. Still further, south, 1,000 miles to the east-ward of South Georgia, a raider has sunk or captured two large Norwegian whalefactory ships and their attendant catchers on the 14th and the 15th January.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.Note. The following figures give the losses which have been reported during the period the 16th to 22nd January. They should not beconfused with the figures shoivn for the last week in the diagrams ofshipping losses attached, at the back of the Resume, zvhich show theactual losses for each complete week since the outbreak of war, and are-only made up to midnight of Sunday-Monday of the iveek immediately preceding that covered by this Resume. Later figures are not includedin the diagrams, as they are likely to be unreliable, owing to delayednotifications and uncertainty regarding the result of recent attacks.12. Seventeen vessels and one small craft, a total of 94,885 tons, have beenreported lost by enemy action; of these, nine were British (40,482 tons) and nineAllied (54,403 tons). Seven of these ships were sunk during the period underreview.Six ships (39,043 tons) were sunk by U-Boat, two in the South Atlantic andthe remainder in the North-Western Approaches. Four ships and a tug(22,296 tons) were sunk by aircraft. Three ships (31,434 tons) were sunk by enemy surface raiders, one 650 west of the Canaries and the two Norwegianwhale factory ships in the Antarctic.Nineteen ships, all but one of which are British, are reported damaged.Details of ships sunk and damaged are given in Appendix I.The British ships Zealandic (10,578 tons) and Almeda Star (14,935 tons) are known to have been attacked in the North-Western Approaches on the 15th and17th January respectively, and search for them by H.M. Ships has so far beenwithout result.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending noon, Wednesday, the 22nd January, 633 ships,including 136 Allied and 15 neutral, were convoyed, of which three were lost by enemy action. Total losses in convoy since commencement of hostilities are :British 171, Allied 28, Neutral 16, total 215; giving a ratio of losses tonumbers convoyed of British 1 in 238, Allied 1 in 206, Neutral 1 in 269, total1 in 236. One battleship, one aircraft-carrier, 10 armed merchant cruisers,39 destroyers and 43 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the18th January totalled 764,232 tons, compared with 469,521 tons during theprevious seven days, and an average of 663,517 tons for the previous ten weeks.Oil imports, in sixteen tankers, were 179,075 tons compared with 85,284 tons innine tankers during the week ending the 11th January. Mineral importsamounted to 285,439 tons, of which 189,678 were steel, iron-ore, pig-iron andscrap iron, and there were large quantities of copper, zinc and phosphates. Thecorresponding figures for the previous seven days were 140,208 tons and97,223 tons. Timber imports were 52,599 tons, and cereal imports were90,977 tons, eight ships being fully laden with grain. Other food imports totalled60,475 tons, of which 13,009 tons were refrigerated and tinned meats, bacon and hams, 12,561 tons were sugar, 5,398 tons were tea, and 2,631 tons were fruit.There were also 24,437 packages of onions, 3,000 bags of almonds, 17,075 halfchests of Seville oranges, and 52,500 cases of citrus fruit. Wine and spiritimports totalled 7,255 tons. Among manufactured goods entering the country were 2,839 tons of machine tools.
British Minelaying.14. Except for a few airborne mines laid off the French Atlantic coastthere has been no British minelaying in the past week because of the bad weather and lack of escorts.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.15. Enemy aircraft laid mines off the Humber on the nights of the 15th/16thand the 16th/17th January, off Milford Haven and in the Bristol Channel onthe night of the 16th/17th, and in the Thames Estuary on the night of the19th/20th. Mines were also seen to drop in Moelfre Bay, which is on the coast of Anglesey in the Liverpool approaches, and a dangerous area was declared.The heavy minelaying in the Liverpool approaches carried out by enemy aircraft last week has resulted in six casualties this week. Only two of these shipssank, the others, including three H.M. Ships, reached harbour safely. three ships were mined in the Bristol Channel, one of which sank. One was sunk in the thames Estuary, and another was mined off Milford Haven but safely docked.During the week LL Sweep detonated four magnetic mines in the Liverpoolapproaches, four in the Thames Estuary, two off Milford Haven, and one each offHarwich, Falmouth and in the Bristol Channel.S.A. Gear, Type A, detonated three acoustic mines in the Liverpoolapproaches, three in the Thames Estuary, and one off Plymouth. Type Cdetonated four acoustic mines off Milford Haven, and an A.A. Trawler fitted with a jury rig detonated her first acoustic mine off Liverpool. H.M.S. Viscountput up two acoustic mines off Liverpool.The mine totals are : acoustic 153, magnetic 869, contact 795.Foreign Waters.16. The Germans are reported to have laid mines in the outer approaches to Trondheim, Norway.Enemy Minesweeping.16a. There are further indications of enemy minesweeping activity in theDover area. Of several British mines which have been washed ashore, nine havebeen cut, and some Oropesa-type floats, presumed to be of enemy origin, have alsobeen washed ashore.Enemy Shipping.German.17. Only five German ships are reported to have been in Trieste on the1st January, whereas twenty were said to have been there on the 5th December,of which nine left on the 15th December for an unknown destination.It has been reported that a 10,000-ton ship which was recently raised at narvik is now at Banak, in Norway, being used as a depot ship for troops and aircraft personnel. This may be the Jan Wellem, 11,776 tons, reports of the raising of&apos; which had previously been received and which was said to have leftNarvik in December.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.18. A new Armoured Division, probably the 12th, has been formed in the protectorate, bringing the total up to thirteen. Three of these Divisions are probably in Roumania.The total of identified Divisions has now increased to 218.

The fall of Kelcyrehas been followed by further advances in the CentralSector, during which ah important and strongly defended height was captured.In this operation 1,000 prisoners of the 77th Regiment, 7th Division, includingthe Commanding Officer, Colonel Menenghetti, and many other officers were taken.20. The position shows a tendency to stabilise. The Italians have shippedconsiderable numbers of fresh troops to Albania and, pending any further markedsuccesses by the Greeks, it is probable that General Cavallero will now be able tocable home that he has &quot; stopped the rot.&quot;Roumania.21. There appears to be no slackening of German train movements to roumania, and there are indications that personnel, as opposed to equipment, isarriving at a faster pace than previously. There are probably at least ninedivisions in the country, of which the majority are opposite the Bulgarianfrontier.  This figure is likely to rise considerably by the end of January.22. On the morning of the 21st January, Legionaires (Iron Guards) seizedseveral public buildings in Bucharest, including the Prefecture of Police. Theywere ejected by troops after some firing and a few casualties. Bucharest is nowheavily guarded by tanks and armoured cars. The German army has so far notintervened. Disturbances in the provinces, are also reported, but no details areyet available. . .;Bulgaria.23. Heavy snow and gales have been reported in the Sofia area, and snowextends as far eastwards as Burgas. Roads over the mountains are believed to beblocked. The withdrawal of Bulgarian troops from the Turkish border to their normal peace-time stations continues, and only elements of the three or four divisions previously located on this frontier remain. Some of the infantry onthis frontier are being replaced by cavalry.Africa.Libya: -       &apos; - -  -       . &apos;-&apos;   . -24. The attack on Tobruk was launched on the morning of the 21st January,and our infantry and tanks, supported by the Royal Navy and the Royal AirForce, successfully penetrated both the outer and inner defences to a depth of over
5 miles.   The Italian cruiser San Georgic in Tobruk harbour was set on fire,together with a number of dumps, stores and petrol, &amp;c.Australian troops entered Tobruk shortly after midday on the 22nd January.25.   So far over 14,000 prisoners have been taken together with about 200guns of various calibres and quantities of material.Our casualties were under 500.26. With the fall of. Tobruk Marshal Graziani is left with 5 divisions out ofthe original 15; 2 are in Cirenaica and 3 in Tripolitania. No Italian reinforce-ments are known to have arrived in Libya, nor has any eastward movement of theTripolitanian garrison yet been reported. The Italians will probably have theassistance of German aircraft when next engaged with our forces.27. The course of our advance from Egypt since the start of operations isoutlined below : December 7. Operations against  Italians  in  Sidi  Barrani  area  com-menced.,,      10. Camps at Nibeiwa-Tummar-Maktila captured.,,      11. Sidi Barrani captured.,,      16. Sollum, Fort Capuzzo, Sidi Omar captured.,,      28. Prisoners up to this date estimated at 38,000.January    3. Centre defences of Bardia penetrated.,,        5. Bardia captured with at least 32,000 prisoners.,, 12. Now estimated that during operations against Bardia 2,041officers and 42,827 other ranks were captured or killed.Equipment taken or destroyed included 368 medium and field guns, 26 heavy A.A. guns, 68 light A.A. guns, 117light tanks, 13 medium tanks and 708 M.T.,,      21. Outer Defences Tobruk penetrated.,,      22. Tobruk captured with 15,000 prisoners.Sudan.28. On the night of the 17th/18th January the Italians evacuated Kassala.This place and Tessenci, over the border in Eritrea, have been occupied by our forces. By the 21st January our forces had occupied Aicota (26 miles east ofTessenci) and are now in touch with the enemy holding defensive positionscovering Bishia and Barento, some 60 miles to the eastwards of Kassala.A abyssinia.29. Rebel activity is so far most active in the north-west corner of thecountry, in the Gojjam and Lake Tana districts.Kenya.30. During the week patrol activity has taken place on the frontier 80 miles east of Lake Rudolf and along the frontier between Kenya and italian somaliland.Far East (French Indo-China).31. The majority of the reports of recent fighting have come from officialThai communiques. These state that Thai forces have crossed the frontier andadvanced in the direction of Luang Prabang, Bassac, Sisophon, Siemreap andBattembang, and have captured some prisoners and a quantity of war material.French official sources, whilst admitting a Thai advance of 7 miles along theSisophon road, claim that Thai forces in the general Poipet-Sisophon area havebeen dispersed, and that they have occupied the island of Done Sanot, in theMekong river, 45 miles south-east of Savannakhet. The situation is still fluid.Thai reports of penetration into Indo-China may be exaggerated. There are signs that both sides are willing to negotiate, but prospects of an immediate settlementdo not appear good.[22148] c
AIR SITUATION.General Review.32. Operations of the Home Commands were again severely restricted by&quot;unfavourable weather conditions: The main feature of the week&apos;s operations wasa further successful night bombing at lack on the naval port of Wilhelmshaveh IEnemy attacks on this country were not oir a, big shale and occurred on only three nights during the week.Three heavy attacks were made on Malta mainly by German aircraft, uponwhich our fighters inflicted heavy losses.In Libya our aircraft continued their offensive operations and co-operated with the ground forces in the capture of Tobruk.Operational aircraft casualties and extracts from recent Raid AssessmentReports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied Territory.33. Bomber Command flew only 14 day and 131 night sorties, due to thevery unfavourable wintry weather conditions which prevailed almost throughoutthe week.34. On the night of the 16th/17th January a heavy attack was made on thenaval port at Wilhelmshaven for the second night - in succession, the precedingattack having been reported in last week&apos;s Resume. Nearly fifty aircraft bombed the objective and huge fires were reported at the Railway Station, and in oilcisterns on the north bank of Hipper Hafen. Many bombs were not seen to burstowing to the general conflagration. Other bombers attacked oil targets and the docks at Emden and Rotterdam with good results.35. Twenty-nine aircraft attacked industrial targets at Dusseldorf on the night of the 22nd/23rd January. Although heavy cloud made it very difficultto locate the target, a number of fires were started within the area. A single aircraft bombed the wharves at the Inland Port of Duisburg-Ruhrort and a verylarge fire resulted.36. Blenheims of Fighter Command have carried out offensive night patrolsover Northern France. During these operations aerodromes were attacked andone enemy aircraft probably shot down.37. Offensive day patrols by our fighters over Belgium and France have continued. They were made at very low heights and determined attacks were carried out on a variety of opportunity targets, including enemy fighters on theground, M.T. echelons and A.A. positions.United Kingdom.38. The scale of effort of the German Air Force against Great Britain was again light and the policy of consolidation continued. During daylight somereconnaissance activity was evident, particularly in connection with our shipping and convoys. A few attacks were carried out in the Thames Estuaryand also by long-range aircraft operating over the Atlantic. Penetrations inlandwere mostly by single aircraft and were not numerous, bombs being dropped on various parts of the country without great effect. Our fighters endeavoured onall possible occasions to intercept these raiders, but weather conditions were generally unfavourable and only four enemy aircraft were destroyed, althoughothers sustained serious damage.39. Night raids by long-range bombers were concentrated on the Bristol,Swansea and Southampton areas, but the scale of operations was not heavy. no attempt at concentrating the attack on successive nights against the same targetwas evident, and on four nights either no attack was made or the number of aircraft employed was negligible. A.A. fire accounted for seven of the enemyraiders, five of which were destroyed on the night of the attack on Southampton.40. Fighter Command flew 314 patrols, involving 675 sorties by day and161 sorties by night. These totals are a considerable decrease on the previousweek.
Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying. 141. Aircraft of the Coastal Command flew 150 patrols involving 309 sorties.These sorties include 139 convoy escorts which were maintained throughout theweek in spite of very unfavourable flying conditions. In addition. fighter command also flew 71 convoy and shipping-protection sorties. .42. Coastal Command aircraft made a number of attacks on. enemy shipping. On the 17th January aircraft were despatched on four occasions toattack convoys off the Dutch coast. No fewer than four vessels received direct hits, another small vessel was probably hit and there were nine instances of near misses; three aircraft returned damaged by A.A. fire. On the 21st January aSunderland carried out a reconnaissance of Narvik and the Norwegian coast; anear miss was scored on a merchant vessel in the Harbour, and soldiers on aparade ground were also attacked.43. Mines were successfully laid on one night by three Hampdens off Brest.It is estimated that 97 enemy minelayers were operating, which was aconsiderable reduction on the total of the previous week.Egypt and Libya.44. Constant night attacks have been made on Tobruk, the heaviest of whichwas on the night of the 17th /18th January, when 13 tons of bombs were dropped.A violent explosion and a very large fire occurred near the petrol dump. the motor boat repair shop and the engineers&apos; barracks were also hit and bombs fellin a camp of about 200 tents. Preliminary to the ground assault, eightWellingtons successfully bombed a camp near Sidi Mahoud and the cross roadsnorth-west of El Gubbi, which were in the defended zone of Tobruk. On the21st January Blenheims made eighty-seven sorties against the defences insupport of the assault by our troops. Bombs were dropped on M.T. vehicles, gun positions, buildings, the wharf and on the cruiser San Giorgio. From these operations only one Blenheim is missing.45. Our fighters maintained patrols in the Tobruk area and also providedescorts for our bombers and protection for Naval Units off the coast, but did not meet with much opposition. Two S. 8Ts were destroyed, and on the 21st Januarythree Hurricanes attacked six G. 50&apos;s, destroying one and damaging another.During this engagement, however, one Hurricane was shot down, another forcedto land by A.A. fire, and the third was damaged.46. Seven Blenheims made a daylight attack on the barracks at Derna onthe 16th January, and on the night 21st/22nd January several tons of bombs were again dropped on military targets in the same locality, causing- fires which werevisible 80 miles away. On the following day Blenheims resumed these attacks and also bombed the barracks at Apollonia.47. Italian air activity over the Libyan battle area has been negligible.Three single aircraft carried out abortive raids in the Suez Canal area.Malta and Sicily.48. The successful bombing of Catania aerodrome reported in last week&apos;resume was followed by three further determined attacks by Wellingtons on thenights of the 15th/16th, 20th/ 21st and 22nd/23rd January, and nearly 35 tonsof bombs were dropped. Two hangars were hit and set alight, and a fire whichwas caused in the Administrative building was visible many miles distant.Bombs fell among aircraft on the ground and a number of these burst into flames.Single aircraft also attacked aerodromes at Comiso and Augusta, and targets at Syracuse.49. The enemy made heavy daylight dive-bombing attacks on the GrandHarbour and Dock Yards, and on Luqa and Hal Far aerodromes. On each occasion a mixed force of approximately 80 J.U. 87&apos;s and J.U. 88&apos;s were employed, with an escort of C.R. 42 fighters. Considerable damage to hangars and buildings was caused at both our aerodromes, and several aircraft on the
ground were destroyed or damaged. The. aerodrome at Luqa was rendered unservicable. Some damage resulted in the dockyard area and to civilianproperty.50. Our fighters, which included some F.A.A. Fulmars, and which on no occasion exceeded eight in number, attacked the enemy aircraft with the greatestdetermination, and succeeded in destroying, or probably destroying, twenty-five of them and damaging nine others. Anti-aircraft gunners were also effective and accounted for a further seventeen. Of this combined total all but three wereGerman aircraft. Our losses in aircraft were one Hurricane and two Fulmars,but one crew was saved. The Dive-Bombing during the third raid was reportedto be less determined.51. On the 21st January, several enemy aircraft made individual raids, but no military targets were damaged.Greece, Albania and Dodecanese.52. Bad weather conditions restricted Royal Air Force activity. Blenheimscarried out two daylight attacks on Berat, and one each on Valona and Elbasan.Four Wellingtons also attacked Valona by night. During these operationsmilitary objectives were hit and many fires started.53. On the 20th January nine enemy aircraft bombed piraeus; a large cargovessel was damaged, together with some civilian property. Our Gladiatorsintercepted the raid and shot down one bomber; one of our fighters crashed inflames on landing. On the same day one Savoia with three C.R. 42&apos;s attackedHerakleion Aerodrome, causing some slight damage.54 On the night of the 16th/17th January one Wellington carried out anattack on the aerodrome at Maritza in the Island of Rhodes, from which it issuspected that German bombers have been operating. This attack was repeatedon the night of the 21st/22nd by seven Wellingtons, and fires were started amongaerodrome buildings.Palestine,55. Single aircraft have been reported over Palestine, and bombs have been dropped at Tel Aviv, Sarafand and Aqir.Sudan and East Africa.56. Light bombing attacks were made over a large area. Two attacks weremade on searchlight positions and suspected petrol dumps near Massawa, wherethree searchlights were probably hit. Five Wellesleys bombed dispersed aircraft on the ground at Barentu and the Caproni Works at Mai Adaga were hit.Bombs were dropped on a concentration of M.T. and a gun position at Tessenei.57. In British Somaliland and Eritrea attacks were made on the fortifiedposts at Burao, on the supply depot at Assab, on a stores compound at Berbera,and on a number of military targets.58. Six J.U. 86&apos;s of the South African Air Force dive-bombed a concentra-tion of M.T. at JNeghelli. A petrol dump was set on fire and the M.T. park was completely gutted. Three Battles attacked Javello aerodrome and one C.A. 133was hit and another damaged. On the following day, during an attack on an aerodrome south of Addis Ababa by six Battles, four S. 81&apos;s were destroyed andanother severely damaged.Air Intelligence.Italy.59. There are reports of activity by German Air Force personnel at Pola,and it is rumoured that all aerodrome and seaplane station facilities there are tobe handed over to the Germans. Reports have also been received that theGermans are making an aerodrome for their own use at Taranto.
Bulgaria.60. It was recently reported that most aerodromes were serviceable, and communications nearly normal.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.61. Bad weather has probably been responsible for the small scale of enemy air activity during the: week, but bombs were dropped in many places in theeastern half of England.   No serious damage affecting our war effort was done.By Night.62. On three nights, the 18th/19th, 20th/21st and 21st/22nd January, nobombs were dropped. On the night of the 17th/18th January there was aconcentrated attack on South Wales, and on the other nights bombs were droppedover wide areas.Damage.Docks.63. At Swansea on the night of the 17th/18th January the main shop ofthe Prince of Wales Dock Company was gutted and machinery damaged, and considerable damage was also done to sheds and warehouses at Palmers Dry Dock,King&apos;s Dock and South Docks.At Avonmouth on the night of the 16th/17th January the yard at theMountstuart Dry Docks was gutted.Railways.64. Railways have escaped serious damage from enemy action, but a certainamount of congestion and dislocation of traffic has been caused by snow, especiallyin the marshalling yards in the Midlands.tRoads.65. Roads in many parts of the country have been blocked by snow orrendered difficult for transport by frost, but the position is rapidly improving.Public Utilities.66. Electricity.

An informant who was present in the harbour on the 1st and2nd January states that three of the four slips at the Atlas Werke facingNo. 1 Basin were rendered completely useless and stores in the vicinity were burnt out. All work at the Atlas Werke stopped and had not been resumed when he left on the 3rd January.Hamburg. Chemische Fabrik Promonta G.m.b.F . has been seriously damaged and steps have been taken for some of their products to be manufactured in Poland. About the end of November the Mohr margarine factory at AltonaBahrenf eld was hit, resulting in it being completely wrecked or burnt out.Berlin. On the 15th/16th December a large block of property in the NeueWilhelmstrasse was totally destroyed. The informant confirmed previous reportsof damage to the railway junction at Schoneberg and stated that two trains werewrecked.Mannheim. The Waldhof Station and the line from Waldhof to Sandtorfwere both heavily damaged in December. Schiffs-u-Maschinenbau. A.G. receiveddirect hits.   Production was affected 40 per cent.Leuna. A report that should be treated with reserve stated that the oil plant had been seriously damaged on two occasions, and that on one of them10 days were required to replace damaged pipes and conduits.
^ o general. Sources who previously have criticised our bombing now statethat since December raids, especially on Bremen, Ludwigshafen, Cologne andMannheim, have assumed a different character. The bombing accuracy is described as excellent, and the population of the above places are stated to showdefinite signs of anxiety and unrest.Occupied France.Rennes. In the attack on the 14th/15th November the runways at the aerodrome suffered considerable damage. An aircraft on the ground was destroyed and several Germans were killed.Brest. On the 7th/8th December the wood-working shop at the Arsenal was destroyed, by fire, and on the 12th/13th December a considerable number ofelectric engines in the arsenal were destroyed and fires broke out in certain of thebuildings.Photographs taken by P.R.TJ. disclose that the lower part of the largefloating crane in the torpedo-boat station harbour is completely submerged, itspontoon presumably having been damaged. No attempt is being made to repairthe three large oil tanks which have been destroyed at the oil depot. considerable damage has been done to the buildings adjoining the West jetty and in theneighbourhood of the dry dock to the East of the Grand Bassin du Nord-Est.Mining.The Swedish steamer Berta, of 1,215 tons, was sunk by a mine on the11th January near the entrance to Copenhagen harbour. On the 12th Januarya German motor vessel Brechsee, of 688 tons, found the ice in the South Soundtoo strong for her engines. She was carried into shallower water, where amagnetic mine exploded and sank her. The recent easterly wind caused thenorth-going stream in the Sound to carry away the navigational marks showingswept channels, and efficient sweeping is being interfered with.
