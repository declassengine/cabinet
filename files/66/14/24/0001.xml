Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1941. I ysSECRET. Copy No.    2-8----- . /   ^ .W.P. (41) 1- &apos; january 4, 1941.TO JBE.JKEPT... UNDER^^C^AN^KEY.It is requested that special care may be. taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE QUESTION OF BOMBING TFIE ROUMANIAN OILFIELDS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE possibility of bombing the Roumanian oilfields was considered by theWar Cabinet on the 27th November (W.M. (40) 297th Conclusions, Minute 1,Confidential Annex). The Prime Minister directed that the necessary prepara-tions should be made so that action could be taken at very short notice if the WarCabinet so decided.Recently, too, the Chiefs of Staff have expressed themselves in favour, fromthe military point of view, of major acts of sabotage in Roumania.Both matters raise the question of the withdrawal of Sir R. Hoare and his mission. If bombing were to be undertaken while Sir R. Hoare was still inBucharest, his life and that of his staff would certainly be endangered, given theimpotence of the present Roumanian Government in the face of their Germanmasters and the Iron Guard. Similarly, sabotage, if successful, and perhaps evenif not, would entail grave risks to Sir R. Hoare and his staff.This being the position, considerable importance attaches to the intervalwhich might be expected to elapse between a decision being taken in Cabinet to bomb Roumania and the actual carrying out of the operation. But in practice itwill probably be difficult, if not impossible, to interpose any appreciable delaybetween the taking of the decision by the Cabinet and the execution of theoperation.If this is so, we must withdraw the Minister some time before the Cabinettakes its decision. It might be that a fairly long interval would be advisable, forthe Germans would almost certainly realise that withdrawal presages the bombing of the oil resources, and such an interval might lead them to relax their initialvigilance.Meanwhile, the withdrawal of our Legation in Bucharest would entailcertain definite disadvantages. I am not in a position to assess the probable effectof large-scale bombing and sabotage in Roumania, but I have no doubt that this aspect of our plans is being given most careful consideration. The disadvantages of withdrawing the Legation are, however, within my province and are asfollows : ,(a) Once we have withdrawn Sir R. Hoare, we cannot send him back again...and the situation is so fluid in Roumania that it might in the future be very important to have a, Minister in Bucharest in order toco-operate with, and possibly direct, any anti-German movementwhich might in changed circumstances spring up in Roumania. Itwill be remembered that on various occasions in the past we have withdrawn our Missions and have been at a disadvantage afterwards,since we have been unable to reinstate them, e.g., Mexico and, more11254   [22091]
recently, France. If we had been able to be represented at the seat ofthe French Government after the collapse at Bordeaux, many of ourpresent problems might have been lessened or circumvented, and ourexperiences with the Vichy Government show how difficult it is to renew diplomatic contacts once broken.(b) We have not so many points of vantage from which to obtain first-handevidence of conditions inside the German-occupied areas as to throwone away without obtaining commensurate advantages. Our mission in Bucharest provides most useful information, political, military andeconomic, which cannot be obtained elsewhere.(c) Its maintenance encourages the pro-British elements in Roumania, whoare, of course, on the increase owing to the German occupation, and itswithdrawal would correspondingly depress them.(d) The Greek Government have asked us not to withdraw our Legation.In order to complete this note I should perhaps mention certain other disadvantages which the bombing of the Roumanian fields mightentail from the political point of view :  (e) We should be committing an act of aggression against Roumanianterritory; but this is a point we could easily deal with in our propa-ganda, as the oil wells are in effective German occupation and ourquarrel, of course, is with the Germans and not the Roumanians.(/) We should be technically violating Bulgarian territory. This might be serious since it might occur at a time when Bulgarians attitude layin the balance, and that balance might therefore be tilted towards the axis. On the other hand, if our operations were eminently successfulthe Bulgarians might be correspondingly impressed and public opinion might move in our direction.(g) If the German oil position is as precarious as many suppose, a threat ofthis kind would be so vital that the Germans would be bound to take immediate &quot;measures to cope with it. In other words, they might decide, despite all the difficulties of the terrain and the winter orspring climate, to invade the Balkans in an attempt to turn us outof Greece. The German Government have recently stated on several occasions that they do not intend to intervene in the Balkans unlessHis Majesty&apos;s Government establish military and particularly air bases in Northern Greece. Such air bases would presumably benecessary if we were to undertake the bombing of the Roumanian oilwells on any scale. Were the Germans in that case to carry out theirthreat, it seems fairly certain that Turkey would enter the war on our side, though we cannot yet be completely sure of this.None of these considerations is in any way decisive against action, and my own feeling is that a decision to bomb the Roumanian oilfields must primarilydepend on the questions whether (1) the scale of the attack which we could mountin the face of German air forces and anti-aircraft defences would be sufficientto produce such lasting destruction as to affect appreciably Germany&apos;s war potential, and (2) whether this undertaking can be carried through without our having to relax our present efforts to hammer Italy to the full extent of our capacity, especially in the air.Assuming that these two questions are satisfactorily disposed of, my object in submitting this paper is :-- (a) to ensure that the disadvantages entailed in the withdrawal of ourMission to Bucharest are appreciated before a decision is taken toundertake serious sabotage or bombing operations in Roumania;(b) to ensure that if, nevertheless, we decide on sabotage and/or bombing,the Foreign Office will be given sufficient warning in order to with drawour Mission to safety before these operations commenceA.
