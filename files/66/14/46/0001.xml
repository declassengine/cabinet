Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1941.SECRET. Copy No;W.P. (41) 24.February 5, 1941. .TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to &apos;V!ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.CO-OPERATION WITH  THE NETHERLANDS  EAST   INDIES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT a meeting on the 16th January the Far Eastern Committee recommendedme to &quot; seek from the Cabinet authority to exchange orally with the netherlands government reciprocal assurances for mutual help in the event of an unprovokedattack by the Japanese on British or Netherlands positions in the Far East.&quot;2. My colleagues will recall that at the direction of the Cabinet the Chiefsof Staff, in preparing their Far Eastern Appreciation (W.P. (40) 302) of the5th August, 1940, proceeded on the assumption that, in the event of a Japaneseattack on the Netherlands East Indies which the Dutch resisted, we should goto their assistance.   The question whether we should in fact do so was reserved.3. The Dominions Governments were consulted on this point. TheCanadian Government expressed no views and the South African Governmentavoided a direct answer. The New Zealand Government considered that we wereunquestionably bound both by honour and interest to act with all the vigour wecould in support of the Dutch. The Australian Government regarded it as almostinevitable that Japanese aggression against the Netherlands East Indies wouldinvolve us in hostilities with Japan, but considered that the existing military position precluded our entering into a binding unilateral obligation to go to theassistance of the Dutch. Since then, the Chiefs of Staff have, in general, taken the view that, failing an indication of United States support, we should enterinto no binding obligation.4. Although the Dutch have already entered into certain staff conversations with us in the Far East, the absence of any commitment has occasioned difficulties and we have received several indications in authoritative Dutch circles including(on the 20th November) the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs, that without some commitment on our part, full co-operation in preparing foreventualities in the Far East was difficult. Nor has a general indication of ourposition given to M. van Kleffens by my predecessor on the 25th November sufficedto clear aAvay these difficulties.5. It seems eminently desirable that, in order to ensure the most effectiveresistance possible to an attack which now seems increasingly possible, the closestcollaboration should be achieved between our defence services in the Far East andthose of the Dutch. I am well aware that, in opposing the giving of an assurance,the Chiefs of Staff have been influenced by the serious weakness of our own meansof defence; but I am convinced that close co-operation with the Dutch in taking[22195]
whatever precautions are within our means is the best way of meeting the menaceand, further, that the improbability at present of a prior assurance of support from the United States renders this co-operation more, and not less, necessary.It has also occurred to me that our own position would be clarified and assisted ifwe were to receive a reciprocal assurance from the Dutch. This might, forexample, make it easier for us to meet the Dutch requests for aid in obtainingmilitary supplies in the United States, as to which the Netherlands authoritieshave recently pointed out that it is of great importance that the netherlands east Indies army should be properly equipped and in a position to resist any - a,Japanese aggression.6. If this is agreed, we must consider the form of the assurance. A formalguarantee of the integrity of the Netherlands East Indies publicly announced onthe Polish model seems quite out of place, if only because it might well act as astimulant rather than as a deterrent to Japan. What I would propose is a simpleoral statement to M. van Kleffens on the following lines : &quot; That I understandthat in certain Dutch circles the absence of any specific British guarantee hasbeen commented on; the Netherlands Government must be aware of the limitednature of our resources in the Far East at present and would therefore realiseour difficulties. Nevertheless, they can rest assured that, if the Netherlands east indies were attacked, we should do our best to help them, on the understandingthat the Netherlands East Indies would do their best to help us if the attack fellon Burma, Malaya or British territories in Borneo.&quot; (The Dutch have already informed us that they would remain &quot; non-belligerent &quot; in the case of an attackon Hong Kong alone.)7. I would invite the approval of my colleagues for an approach to theNetherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs in this sense, subject to the concurrence of the Dominions. It is desirable that this should be done in the near future inorder to assist as far as possible the staff conference to which the Commander-in-chief, Far East, has invited representatives of the Netherlands East Indies and australia on the 22nd February.A.
