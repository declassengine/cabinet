Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1941.Copy No.W.P. (41) 13.January 27, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SUPPLY OF AIRCRAFT TO CHINA FROM THE UNITED STATES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will have noticed from recent telegrams that, into a discussionregarding the supply to Greece of American fighter aircraft, the United StatesGovernment suddenly interposed a request that His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to the release to China of 100 aircraft from current British orders in theUnited States due in the first three months of this year. The request was pressedin spite of representations on our side as to the importance of deliveries to usduring these months and it was made clear that the grant of it was a conditionof the release to us of a further order for 300 aircraft in May, June and July.Mr. Morgenthau, who urged the matter strongly, explained that the requestarose out of a promise to China by President Roosevelt which ante-dated the presidents promise to help Greece and to the honouring of which both thePresident and the United States Government attached great importance.2. We were at a loss to understand why this promise should be fulfilledat the expense of British allocations. We had been told at an earlier stage thatthe United States Government were contemplating the supply of aircraft to china in response to Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s appeals for air assistance. In response to the same appeals we had agreed to facilitate the assembly and manufacture in India of aircraft for China by permitting the transfer of the Loiwing factoryfrom China to a site in India; but in announcing this to Chiang Kai-shek andthe United States Government we had emphasised that owing to our war needswe could not ourselves supply armaments, and more particularly aircraft, for china.3. We therefore, in a telegram to Washington, expressed serious objectionsto the United States proposal that their commitment to China should be fulfilledfrom British orders. His Majesty&apos;s Representative at Washington replied,however, that the position was more complicated than it had at first appeared.The aircraft in question were not aircraft in production, but aircraft released by the United States army and still, to some extent, under the control of theUnited States authorities. Mr. Morgenthau had made it plain that theAdministration were determined that they should go to China and the view ofMr. Purvis was that in the present state of the financial negotiations between sir F. Phillips and Mr. Morgenthau we simply could not afford a dispute withthe latter.4. In the circumstances we had no choice but to acquiesce in the supply ofthe 100 machines to China, and Mr. Butler was instructed on the 14th January toask the United States authorities to help us to get what credit we could byinforming the Chinese Government that we had agreed to make this sacrificein spite of the extreme urgency of our own needs. Mr. Welles informedMr. Butler on the 18th January that he had spoken in this sense to the ChineseAmbassador in Washington.11276   [22154]
5. According to a telegram from the British Air Commission in washington to the Ministry of Aircraft Production (Briny 2865 of the 22nd January, of whicha copy is annexed) the United States Administration are now trying to pushus still further. From this telegram it appears that the British Air commission had already completed contract arrangements for the resale of the aircraft to theCurtis Corporation for subsequent sale by that Corporation to an Americancorporation buying on behalf of the Chinese Government, when the United states treasury, alleging that this procedure involved governmental technical difficulties, suggested that we should arrange a direct sale to the AmericanCorporation buying on behalf of the Chinese. The British Air Commissionstrongly deprecated this on the ground that it seemed to involve internationalcomplications, but, at the request of the United States Treasury, have submitted the matter for urgent instructions.8. The international complications which the British Air Commissionforesee no doubt relate to the possible reaction of Japan to what comes very near to being a direct sale of aircraft by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the ChineseGovernment.7. The attitude of the United States Government in the whole matter isextraordinary. Having undertaken themselves to supply aircraft to China, they propose to fulfil it with aircraft originally allotted to this country regardless ofthe ability of the Chinese to use them and of the greater urgency of our own needs. The motives for their further request that we should camouflage this operation for them are obscure, but it can only be surmised that they still feelthat the transaction will involve them either in difficulties with their own publicopinion or in the risk of war with Japan or in both; and that they wish us toassume a risk which they are unwilling to assume themselves.8. The risk involved, so far as we are concerned, is possibly greater inappearance than in reality. Japan is openly allied to our enemies and is activelyassisting them in many ways. Our connivance at the sale of United states aircraft to China might provide the excuse for more open assistance to Germany.But whether or not Japan joins Germany as a belligerent is a matter of major policy, and an isolated transaction on our part (if she discovers it) is perhapsunlikely to precipitate belligerency unless she intends this in any case, judgesthe general situation favourable and is looking for a pretext. On our side, our action would not be unneutral, as there is no declared state of war between japan and China. Technically also, we are not asked to make a direct sale to theGovernment of China, but to an American corporation; and whether we resell tothe original producers or to some other corporation, the aircraft are american and will be supplied to China by America. The transaction, therefore, is probablyeven less provocative to Japan than the facilities which we have already decidedto give for the production in India of aircraft for China.9.   Weighed against the inadvisability of offending the United StatesGovernment at this stage, we may eventually, therefore, feel that we can take therisk involved, but the whole proceeding is so extraordinary that, before coming to a decision, I feel that we should represent frankly to the United States thedifficulties in which they have placed us, and that we should let them know that,if the transaction is carried out as they propose and is discovered by the Japanese,we shall be obliged to let it be known that we acted at the request of the UnitedStates Government.   Much will depend on the manner of our representations tothe United States.   There is, of course, no question of recovering the aircraft for our own use.  But I cannot believe that President Roosevelt would approve theI atttitude of the United States Administration in requiring us to take the whole\ onus of a transaction which the Americans, at all events, consider to be attendedI with a fair degree of risk, if the facts were put to him, either through1 Lord Halifax or Mr. Hopkins.   This I propose to do before asking the Cabinetn to take a decision, but I think my colleagues would wish to know the present :- position.Foreign Of/ice, January 27, 1941,
ANNEX.British Air Commission, Washington, to the Ministry of Aircraft Production.(Briny 2665.  Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, January 22, 1941.WITH reference to M.A.P. 2879 concerning sale of 100 Tomahawks to theChinese, we have proceeded, with the concurrence of the United States Treasury,on the bases of resale to the Curtiss Corporation for subsequent sale by them toan American Corporation buying on behalf of the Chinese Government.2. United States Treasury now represents governmental technical difficul-ties involved by this procedure, and suggest we should arrange sale direct to theAmerican Corporation buying on behalf of the Chinese.3. We have replied that to do so would seem to involve international compli-cations arising from a direct sale from the United Kingdom Government to theChinese Government and have strongly deprecated any such procedure, and theUnited States Treasury have asked that the matter be remitted to London for urgent decision. For our part the proposal seems open to serious objections. Itis difficult to understand why the United States Administration should not solvetheir own administrative difficulties in view of their insistence on this transferof aircraft to the Chinese to fulfil their own public policy.4. The contract arrangements for resale to the Curtiss Corporation havealready been concluded. The United States Treasury, when informed of this,said they assumed we could undo what had been done. Clearly, however, we couldonly achieve this by the United States Administration applying pressure on thecompany.5. Morris Wilson has seen and concurred in the foregoing. The Embassyhave also been informed.
