General Review.naval SITUATION.Naval forces in the Eastern Mediterranean have been continuing operation -in support of the Army in the Western Desert.Although the tonnage which has been reported lost due to enemy action isconsiderable, the actual losses of merchant shipping during the week underreview, as far as is known at present, were not excessive. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has been concentrated on the south-ea,st coast. &apos; .Home Waters.2. M.T.Bs. carried out a sweep off the Belgian coast on the night of the13th December but sighted no enemy ships. During a similar operation on the night of the 17th/ 18th a large armed merchant vessel was torpedoed and sunk off Zeebrugge, one armed trawler was hit by machine-gun fire and another possiblyhit by a torpedo.  No casualties or damage were sustained by our forces.The British-manned French torpedo-boat Branlebas apparently broke herback and foundered off the Lizard in heavy weather while escorting a convovto Dartmouth on the 14th; 3 survivors were picked up. On the 17th H.MDestroyer Acheron sank following an explosion whilst carrying out high-speedturning trials off the Isle of Wight. Some survivors were picked up. The causeof the explosion has not been ascertained, but a new contact minefield is suspectedin this area.On the 15th December H.M. Minesweeper Britomart was damaged in collisionoff the Orkneys and will require docking. On the same day the Polish destroyerBlyskawica dragged on to H.M. Canadian destroyer Skeena in the Clyde and damaged her above the waterline.The Town class destroyers (ex-US.S.) Reading and Ramsey have arrived in home waters from Canada.H.M. Cruiser Mauritius was commissioned on the 14th December.North Atlantic.3: During the week a force, which included heavy ships, has carried out a patrol in the Azores area, and additional submarine patrols have been stationed in the Bay of Biscay.Mediterranean.4. Naval units of the Mediterranean Fleet have been engaged in harassingthe retreat of the Italians, supplying our forward troops and evacuatingprisoners. H.M. Monitor Terror, with Swordfish aircraft co-operating, success-fully bombarded Bardia. During this operation Terror was ineffectivelyattacked by an E-Boat. The Italian submarine Naiade, which attempted tointerfere with these operations, was sunk by H.M. destroyers Hyperion and here-ward, on the morning of the 14th, five officers and 42 ratings being taken prisoner.H.M.S. Coventry was torpedoed by a U-Boat on the 13th, but was only slightly damaged.Fleet Air Arm aircraft from Malta successfully attacked Tripoli on the night of the 13th/14th, obtaining three direct hits on two ships alongside as wellas inflicting damage on warehouses, and bombing ships in harbour.H.M. Submarine Truant reported that she sank one and possibly two loadedmerchant ships off Cape Spartivento on the night of the 13th/14th, and a largesouth-bound tanker in the Gulf of Taranto on the night of the 15th/16th.H.M. Submarine Triton and the Free French submarine Narval are bothoverdue. The former was on patrol in the South Adriatic, and the latter betweenSicily and Tripoli.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. H.M. Submarine Thunderbolt reported that she successfully attacked an italian U-Boat escorted by three trawlers off the Gironde on the 15th December.H.M.S. Bridgewater, which was escorting a merchant ship to Freetown,chased a U-Boat of unknown nationality in a position 150 miles west of Dakar.
An attack was made by one of our aircraft on the 13th December eight miles north-west of Newquay, and one hit Was claimed with a 100-lb. bomb. destroyers and aircraft continued to search and HM. A/S; Yacht Migrante attacked a firmcontact 30 miles to the northward on the following day.Enemy Intelligence. .German.6. Air reconnaissances of the German naval ports on the 14th and15th December produced the first substantial information of German main unitsavailable for some time. The battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz were seen at hamburg and Wilhelmshaven respectively ^ At Kiel the pocket battleship Lutzowhad moved out of dry dock and was alongside. The two old Schlesien classbattleships were both in Kiel, one in dry dock and one in a floating dock.A six-inch cruiser, probably nurnberg, was also in dry dock at Kiel. six destroyers were seen in the German ports as a whole, and one in dry dock. Therewas no indication of the whereabouts of either Scharnhorst or Gneisenau.Italian.7. Air reconnaissance of Italian ports on the 17th and 18th Decemberobserved one cruiser in dock at Naples, and a number of merchant ships in theport; one 6-inch cruiser at Messina; and two Cavour class battleships, one 6-inch cruiser and five destroyers at Taranto. There were no reports of the whereaboutsof the other battleships.U-Boats.8. In the earlier part of the week there were five or six German and twoor three Italian U-Boats in the North-West Approaches. There are indications that in this area the Germans have been moving gradually northwards and theItalians have correspondingly moved to the central part of the area. The presentdispositions suggest that when the Germans leave patrol, they may return toBergen in preference to Lorient. One or two German U-Boats are in the CapeVerdeiArea and to the south of it (one may possibly be Italian) and perhaps two italian U-Boats near the Azores.There is no further news of the two Italian U-Boats which left Tangier onthe 13th December.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.act. The following figures give the losses which have been reported during the period the llth-lQth December. They should not beconfused with the figures shown for the last week in the diagrams ofshipping losses attached at the back of the Resume, which show theactual losses for each complete iveek since the outbreak of war and areonly made up to midnight of Sunday-Monday of the week immediately preceding that covered by this Resume. Later figures are not includedin the diagrams as they are likely to be unreliable, owing to delayednotifications and uncertainty regarding the result of recent attacks.9. Details of shipping losses are given in Appendix I. 23 ships totalling 114,863 tons were reported lost by enemy action. Of these, 16 ships(86,837 tons)&apos; were British; 14 ships (90,657 tons) were sunk by U-Boats (12 inthe North-Western Approaches and 2 off the Spanish coast); 3 ships (12,038 tons)by raider and E-Boats; 1 ship (1,673 tons) by aircraft; and 5 ships (10,495 tons)by mines. 8 British ships and 1 Swedish ship were reported damaged by enemy action. During the period from noon the 11th December to noon the18th December only 6 ships (4 British), 3 of which were sailing out of convoy,were reported attacked by U-Boats, and of these 4 were sunk, 5 British ships were mined off Southend, of which 4 were sunk, and 3 ships were attacked by aircraft. Mr. Howe, the Canadian Minister of Munitions, was among the survivors from the s.s. Western Prince, which was torpedoed and sunk far outm the North-Western Approaches on the 14th December. On the same eveninga single E-Boat torpedoed and sank the Danish s.s. Monberg in a southboundconvoy off Yarmouth. The British s.s. Newton Pine reported that she was[22038] &apos; b
attacked  by a  U-Boat about  700  miles  south-west of  Freetown on the13th December.   The ship was first attacked by torpedo, which was avoidedand then unsuccessfully engaged by gunfire for half an hour.On the 18th the British merchant ship Duquesa, on her way from Montevideoto Freetown, reported that she was being shelled by an enemy raider 700 miles south-west of Freetown. The report, which was incomplete, indicated that theraider was the A admiral Scheer.  Dispositions were made to meet this situation.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending noon Wednesday, the 18th December, 671 ships,including 134 allied and 20 neutral, were convoyed, of which seven were lost by enemy action. These seven ships include three in a homeward-bound convoy fromFlalifax. Other ships in this convoy were sunk before the arrival of the localescort, and have, therefore, been excluded from the losses in convoy. One battle-ship, one cruiser, ten armed merchant cruisers, 35 destroyers and 28 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Since the beginning of the war 207 ships, including 23 allied and 16 neutral,have been lost out of 47,281 ships, including 5,110 allied and 4,221 neutral, whichhave been convoyed.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the14th December totalled 904,673 tons, compared with 571,979 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 822,773 tons for the previous ten weeks.Fifteen tankers brought 165,522 tons of oil, compared with 126,348 tons in thirteentankers during the week ending the 6th December. Mineral imports were255.545 tons, of which 180,097 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore.Timber and pulp imports were 66,513 tons, an increase of 9,825 tons. cereal imports were 221,743 tons, compared with only 41,225 tons in the previous week.Twenty-six ships were fully laden with grain.British Minelaying.11. During the week H.M.S. Adventure laid 560 mines in the St. George&apos;s channel, and H.M. Ships Teviot Bank and Icarus laid mines off the Firth ofForth in the East coast mine barrier.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.12. During the week minelaying by enemy aircraft was confined to the east coast, from the Humber southward, except on the night of the 17th December,when minelaying at Belfast was suspected. The Thames Estuary has been visitedmost nights, the raids being particularly intense on the nights of the 12th/13thand the 13th/14th December. Both the Thames and the Medway were closedf for over 30 hours from early on the 13th December, though traffic was allowedto proceed in the London area after being stopped for about 10^ hours.No casualties were caused by mines during the week until the 17th December,when seven ships were mined early in the day off Southend. The mines, whichhad been laid three or four nights previously, were delay action and must have become active just about the time the ships were passing, as these waters hadbeen swept during the night without result, the sweeping being completed about two hours before the first ship was mined.An enemy aeroplane was seen laying mines about nine miles east of Yarmouth,to the westward of the War Channel on the 16th December. The area wassearched by LL and S.A. Trawlers, and the latter detonated 3 mines.LL.Sweeps have detonated 6 mines during the week, two in the? BarrowDeep, three in the Thames-Medway area and one off Plymouth. A skid detonatedone mine off Yarmouth.One acoustic mine was detonated in the Barrow Deep on the 12th Decemberbesides the three mentioned above in the Thames-Medway area, and two mines were detonated in the Barrow Deep on the 16th December.&apos;13. During the week nine mines and nineteen explosive cutters have beenfound in the Dover minefield, making a total of twenty mines and twenty-nineexplosive cutters found in this field.  The explosive cutters are much more efficient
than they have been previously, cutting the sweep every time. (Owing to theduplication of a minesweeping report last week the total of contact mines-in this field must be reduced by two.)Paddle Minesweepers, operating in the outer Thames Estuary, have destroyed two contact mines.The mine totals are as follows: acoustic 96, magnetic 820, contact 761.Temporary arrangements are being made to transfer as many motor coastingships as possible from East to West coast trading, as it is considered desirable,on account of the danger from acoustic mines, that as few as possible should betrading on the East coast south of the Firth of Forth.H.M.A.S. Bathurst, the first of her class of minesweepers, was commissionedon the 6th December.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.14. The Baden (8,204 tons), which, has been in the Canaries since theoutbreak of war, sailed from Teneriffe on the 16th December, and the Madrid(8,777 tons) left Las Palmas on the 11th December in a Northerly direction.The tanker Rekum (5,540 tons), which left Teneriffe on the 17th July, is saidto have arrived at St. Nazaire on the 8th October and landed a wounded seamanfrom the Cymbeline (sunk by a German raider on the 2nd September). An Italianbroadcast on the 12th December stated that the Helgoland (3,664 tons), which leftPuerto Colombia on the 28th October, had reached a German port. This ship issuspected of having acted as a supply ship to a raider.Four German merchant ships are now reported to be trading between east coast Spanish ports and Marseilles and Genoa with cargoes of fruit.In the Black Sea the Ithaka (1,773 tons) left Galatz about the 12th Decemberwith a cargo of .720 tons of German munitions consigned via Batum to the PersianGovernment.Italian.15. The Fortunata (2,715 tons), previously taken in prize by the French, isbelieved-to be at Port Lyautey, Morocco, where she was recently unloading her,cargo of toluol. An Italian crew is reported to have arrived at Larache via Spain.MILITARY SITUATION.The Balkan States.Greece and Albania.   (See also para. 20 below.)16. Though there have been no spectacular events during the past week, theGreek advance has continued slowly along the whole front. On the coastal sectorTepelene is now under heavy artillery fire. The town stands at the end of astrongly fortified gorge, and its capture will be an event of considerable importance. In the mountains more snow has fallen and most of the front isnow under a depth of three feet.  Voskopoja has had 18 degrees of frost.17.   The following personnel arrived at Athens on the 9th December :  Majority of Military Mission (No. 27).Detachment of Kent Corps Troops R.E.Bomb Disposal Unit.25 Specialist Officers.Bulgaria.18; Heavy rain has caused flooding throughout Southern and South-EasternBulgaria, and dislocation of traffic on roads and railways, while deep snow isstill lying in the Sofia area and the Balkan mountains. Aerodromes in the South-East are unserviceable.Italy and Italian Possessions.T .19- The Italian people must by now be aware of reverses in Albania andLibya, but it is improbable that the true state of affairs has been allowed to leakout   A rumour regarding the resignation of Marshal Graziani has had some
circulation. The Western Desert has been successfully cleared of Italian troops and the offensive is being carried into Libya. It is difficult to forecast futureItalian intentions now that they have been deprived of the bulk of their nativetroops, which were used as so much &quot; cannon fodder.&quot;20. . In Albania the Italian withdrawal appears to be slowing up. units have been reinforced individually by small drafts sent by air and sea. It is not known whether the Italians will continue their withdrawal to a pre-arrangeddefensive line, or whether the question of an evacuation is being considered.Middle East.Egypt.21. By the 13th December the elimination of the Italian 64th Division(captured complete at Buq Buq) and 1st and 2nd Libyan Divisions had been confirmed, and the number of prisoners taken was estimated at 25,000. The enemy was then withdrawing from the Bir Sofafi area towards Sollum, pursued by a mobile column formed from the 7th Armoured Division. The withdrawal was subject to heavy air bombing.22. On the 16th December Sollum and Fort Oapuzzo were evacuated, the garrisons withdrawing into the Bardia defences, the exit from which was blockedby 4th Armoured Brigade astride the Tobruk road.23. By the 17th December the frontier forts of Musaid, Sidi Omar andSheferzen had been captured, and a further 800 prisoners and a battery of artillery taken. The 16th Australian Brigade, operating from Siwa, dispersedan enemy column,withdrawing from Jarabub.-; i 24. On the 19th December advanced elements of our troops, which have successfully contained numerically superior forces of the enemy in Bardia, werebeing steadily reinforced, and the position of the Italian Army in this area maybe regarded as precarious.25. The number of prisoners taken so far is 31,546, including 1,626 officers.Several thousand more prisoners are being evacuated from the battle areas.26. The total British and Imperial casualties reported up to the16th December are 72 killed and 738 wounded.Sudan.27. In the Kassala and Gallabat sectors our patrols have been active.Enemy positions have been harassed by artillery fire and a number of casualtiesinflicted. A few casualties but little material damage have been sustained as aresult of enemy air and artillery action.The 144 Field Regiment, R.A., has.arrived in the Sudan.East Africa.28. On the 16th December El Wak (90 miles N.E. of Wajir) was success-fully raided by a force composed of 1st South African Brigade and 24th gold coast Brigade from Wajir. Fifty of the enemy were killed and a number ofprisoners taken. A quantity of material, including 13 small and 2 heavy guns,was captured.Far East.Indo-China.29. The Japanese garrison in Indo-China is thought to be not more thanthe 6,000 men allowed by arrangement with the French. There are no signs ofany further southward advance, and at the moment economic discussions hold the field. Further reports of the disorders in the Saigon area, which are thought to be Communist, show that they were serious.; The French state that theuprisings have been almost mastered.Thailand. ----- - .; .   ..30. Frontier clashes with the French and aerial bombing reprisals havebeen continuing, but there are now signs of negotiations to settle the disputeamicably.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.31. Unfavourable weather conditions have again restricted our operations against the enemy. The outstanding event of the week was the heavy and success-ful attack on Mannheim on the night of the 16th-7th December. Importanttargets at Naples and Milan have also been attacked. Aircraft of the coastal command made several successful bombing attacks on enemy shipping duringthe week.Adverse weather also affected the operations of the enemy against thiscountry, though a particularly heavy attack was made on the Sheffield area onthe night of the 12th-13th December.In Egypt and Libya our aircraft have again given effective support to themilitary forces, and have achieved a decisive ascendancy over the enemy. in greece our operations were hampered by bad weather conditions, but successfulbombing attacks were made on Valona and Durazzo.Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent Raid Assess-ment Reports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied Territory.32. During the week 9 day and 280 night sorties were flown by bomber command and numerous additional attacks were made by Coastal command aircraft. Bad weather has either cancelled or restricted our operations on three nights, but the week has two outstanding attacks.33. Berlin was bombed during protracted operations over a wide area onthe night of the 15th/16th December, and transportation, power and armamenttargets were attacked in excellent visibility. On the following night the soleobjective was the industrial centre of Mannheim on which 108 tons of high-explosive and over 13,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. Countless fires were started and aircraft which arrived late in the night reported that many blocksin the Western and South-Eastern areas were ablaze. Aircraft visited the townon the two following nights and reported many fires still burning after theprevious attacks, and smoke hanging over the town.34. Further operations comprised a highly successful attack on the inlandport of Frankfurt, where the docks were severely damaged, and raids on the KruppShipyards and docks at Kiel. The submarine bases at Brest and Bordeaux werevisited on several occasions, and Channel ports and aerodromes, includingGuernsey, Lorient, Brest and Lanvedoc, were bombed by aircraft of both bomber and Coastal Commands. Three Coastal Command aircraft on a special mission to Norway attacked the Bergen-Oslo Railway and scored a direct hit on a station.Italy.35.   Naples was attacked by eight Wellingtons from Malta on the night ofthe 14th/15th December.    Hits were made on a concentration of cruisers,destroyers and battleships, and an Italian report admitted damage to a medium-sized naval unit, with fifty casualties.    Naples Aerodrome and MargellingoJunction were also attacked at the same time.36. The Pirelli Rubber Factory at Milan was attacked by Wellingtonaircraft from England on the night of the 18th/19th December and, amidstother fires, a large rectangular building was observed to catch fire and burnfiercely with frequent explosions. Single attacks were also made on the railwayat Novara and the docks at Genoa and were observed to start bright fires..Great Britain.37. Fighter Command flew 42,7 patrols involving 1,057 sorties by day and81 by night. These figures show a further decrease, and the number of german aircraft which operated against this country during the week was much smaller than during the previous week, 335 by day as compared with 670, and 755 by nightas compared with 1,095. Our fighters destroyed seven enemy aircraft during theweek and suffered two casualties.[22038] c
38. The enemy&apos;s daylight activities consisted mainly of poastal reconnais-sances. Only one fighter sweep was made during the week on the 12th Decemberby forty aircraft over South-East England; two of these were shot down by our fighters.; ..      , &apos; &apos;   &apos; &apos;&apos;39. Adverse weather has limited-the German effort by night. On three nights of the week no enemy aircraft flew inland, and on two other nightspenetrations were few. However, on the- two .nights when conditions were favourable the enemy continued his policy of making heavy attacks on industrial areas. On the night of the 12th-13th December, 380 enemy aircraft were employedagainst this country, mainly against Sheffield, Leeds and other industrial centres in the Midlands and North-East England, and on the night of the 15th-16th,110 aircraft delivered attacks mainly against the Sheffield, Coventry and Derbyareas.Coastal.40. During the week 155 patrols, involving 449 sorties (including 186 convoy escorts), were flown by aircraft of the Coastal Command, in addition to the bombing attacks on objectives in France and Norway already reported. mines were laid off Brest, Lorient and the Ems River, and many photographicreconnaissances were made by our aircraft along the French, Belgian, Dutch,German and Norwegian Coasts.41. Enemy Coastal shipping was attacked, and a 2,000-ton merchant vesselreceived two direct hits on the bridge, off the Norwegian coast. Two othermerchant vessels were hit off Brest and Lorient, and a ship in convoy off Boulognewas seen to list after attack.42. Enemy mine-laying took place on the, first four nights of the week, withan average of 25 aircraft per night. Attacks by enemy aircraft on our shippingwere negligible during the week, although German Coastal units operated overthe North Sea and Western Approaches, and slight activity was reported fromthe enemy long-range aircraft over the Atlantic.Malta.43. Adverse weather conditions caused some diminution in our air activity.Several reconnaissances were made by our aircraft of Naples, Taranto, Brindisi,Messina and the Ionian Sea. The successful attacks, by Wellingtons on Naples,and by Fleet Air Arm aircraft on Tripoli, have already been described.Enemy aircraft unsuccessfully attacked the Island on three occasions. Theirbombing was inaccurate and the only damage caused was to civilian property.Greece and Albania..44. Bad weather conditions have continued to make air operations overAlbania extremely difficult. Nevertheless, successful raids have been carried outby our aircraft against Valona and Durazzo, where ships in the harbours,barracks, dumps and motor transport were hit. Several reconnaissances overthe Ionian Sea have also been flown.Italian aircraft have been employed in supporting their troops in Albaniaand in attacks on villages and communications, but their bombing continues tobe comparatively ineffective.Egypt and Libya.45. Intensive air operations in support of[J.and offensive continue. our bombers have flown approximately 250 bombing sorties and have carried outnumerous reconnaissances. Our fighters, in addition to harassing enemy land forces and inflicting heavy casualties on troops and motor vehicles, have destroyedtwenty-seven bombers and eighteen fighters in the air-twenty on one day.46. The main harbours, fuel, stores and munition dumps and military objectives of every kind have been heavily attacked, especially at Bardia, whichwas visited no less than thirteen times and where it is considered that very heavy damage was done. ,
47. Many enemy aerodromes and landing grounds have been heavily attacked, extensive damage being done to hangars, administrative buildings&apos; and aircraft on the ground. The heaviest of these attacks was made on the night ofthe 17th/18th December against a concentration of enemy aircraft at Beniha.Two Blenheims and seventeen Wellingtons took part and, in addition to thedestruction of hangars, it is estimated that forty enemy aircraft were rendered unservicable; twelve of these were set on fire and six destroyed or seriously damaged.   Ten fighters were taken on the ground at Sollum.48.   Italian air operations have been concentrated on an attempt to stemthe British advance by bombing and machine-gun attacks on our armoured andmotorised columns and troops.   These attacks have riot met with much successas a result of our defensive fighter patrols and repeated raids on enemy aerodromes.Sudan and East Africa.49. Our aircraft have continued to maintain considerable activity against enemy aerodromes, dumps and troop positions in this region, Assab AsmaraGura and El Wak being the chief objectives. Direct hits were registered on aerodromes and hangars, on stores and on transport parks. El Wak was heavily and successfully attacked on the 16th and 17th December Offensivereconnaissances were again flown by aircraft of the South African Air Force.50. Enemy bombers attacked Port Sudan on the 16th and 17th andsucceeded m destroying 10,000 gallons of petrol. Our fighters intercepted and damaged one enemy aircraft.Aden.51. Air operations against the Quteibi continue, but there are signs thatthe tribesmen are tiring of resistance and a meeting is being arranged.Air Intelligence.Russia.no ,JP; is rePorted that operations were carried out during the night of the26/27th October last in order to test the air defences of the region of the Bakuoilfields According to the statement made after the exercises, the aircraftengaged were able to penetrate the air defences of Baku, but failed to locate the oil refineries, which had been camouflaged.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.52a.   The extent of enemy air activity is summarised under Air Situation.Only one serious incident occurred by day; this was at Chesterton, nearNewcastle-under-Lyme, where 15 people were killed.53. The principal events of the week were attacks on Sheffield on the nights of the 12th-13th and 15th-16th, which rendered approximately 16,000 peoplehomeless. On the night of the 16th-7th minor incidents were reported from many parts of the country, including London. No attacks were made on the night of the 17th-18th and the 18th-19th.Damage.Sheffield.54. An attack lasting nearly nine hours was made on the night of the12th-13th and was concentrated mainly on the centre, north-west and south-east of the City. Although over 200 incidents were reported, the main Steel Valleylargely escaped, and onlv four cases of substantial damage have been reported.The attack on the night of the 15th-16th lasted three hours, and was mainly in the east and east centre; many factories were hit, but only nine of these sufferedsubstantial damage.
Civil Defence Operations.61. The Sheffield raid of the 12th/13th December fully extended the civil defence Services. Police, fire and rescue party reinforcements were called in, andsome 2,000 troops were provided to help the Chief Constable and City Engineer.55. The effect on war production has not been serious, except indirectlythrough damage to public utilities. The Neepsend Gas Works&apos; were severely damaged, and this, together with many broken mams, resulted in extensive failureof gas supplies. Electricity was not so badly affected, but the water distributionsystem in three of the city&apos;s zones of supply suffered considerable damage, and ithas been necessary to supply them from carts.56 Transport was badly disorganised and many roads and main-linerailways were temporarily blocked. A start has been made in restoring tramroutes for munition workers, but it will be some time before trams run through thecentre of the city.57. The material damage caused was extensive, particularly in the centralcommercial part of the city, where numerous fires were started.Service Property.58 Military Headquarters and offices were damaged at Canvey Island onthe night of the 14th/15th December and military billets suffered extensively atButlin&apos;s Camp, Clacton, on the 16th December; some damage was done to FortBurgoyne, Dover, on the night of the 15th/16th December.Civilian Casualties.59 For the week ending 0600 the 18th December the approximate figures are 627 killed and 895 injured and include the following SeriousiKilled. Injured.Sheffield, 12th/13th and 15th/16th       ...      370 455Birmingham, 11th/12th    .........        95 235Cheltenham, 11th/12th     ..........      19 16Unexploded Bombs.60.   The total outstanding has fallen from 2,240 to 2,104.
