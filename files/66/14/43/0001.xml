Printed for the War Cabinet. February 1941.SECRET.W.P. (41) 21.February 3, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.TANGIER.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WHEN the Spanish authorities suppressed the majority of the international institutions in the Tangier Zone we formally protested and reserved all ourrights. It was, however, clearly impossible for the parties to the Tangier Con-vention to meet and discuss the position. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madridwas therefore authorised to negotiate a provisional arrangement concerning therights and interests of British subjects in Tangier, while continuing to reserveour rights and those of third parties under the relevant international instruments.2. The negotiations were conducted by His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Madridand His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Tangier, assisted by a delegation from theBritish community in Tangier. In the course of the negotiations almost all ourpoints were apparently conceded.   These were: (1) Maintenance of the existing rights of British subjects and Britishinstitutions in the Zone.(2) Full compensation for displaced officials.(3) No fortification.(4) Re-introduction of the capitulations in the event of the Mixed Tribunalbeing abolished.(5) Consultation before any further changes are made.Owing to the subsequent twisting and turning of Senor Suner some of these points, particularly point (4), have not been clearly or satisfactorily confirmed. Ina recent interview Senor Suner refused to make any changes in the existing texts,on the ground that all our points were covered. Sir S. Hoare has asked for instructions.3.   The documents and assurances consist of the following : (a) A note from Sir S. Hoare covering a memorandum dealing with therights of British subjects in Tangier. The note reserves our rightsand those of third parties and asks for confirmation that there willbe no fortification and that in certain circumstances capitulationswill be reintroduced. The memorandum is somewhat loosely drafted,and leaves some loopholes for evasion, particularly as regardscapitulations and the treatment of the British newspaper.(&amp;) A reply from the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs accepting thememorandum, but not in terms confirming the understandings in Sir S. Hoare&apos;s note about fortifications and capitulations.(c) A further note from the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs giving a satisfactory assurance about the non-fortification of the Zone, butnot referring specifically to Sir S. Hoare&apos;s note.11283   [22179]Copy No.
id) Two oral assurances from %e,.Sp^i^h.^inist.er for Foreign Affairs whichwe can publish:-(i) that the memorandum does in fact provide for the reintroduction.--&apos;. linn- of the capitukitions in certain circumstances.&apos; : i ; (ii);:tbat the Spanish Government will consult His Majesty&apos;s government --   K&apos;:/&apos;.S&apos;:j::u;v&apos;;r nient in the event of any further change being contemplated.(e) Assurances have been received concerning the maintenance of the separateeconomic and financial regime in the Tangier Zone, and further negotiations are in progress in Tangier on this point.   These cannotbe entirely divorced from the negotiations for the supply of the French, and Spanish Zones of Morocco, as the prosperity of Tangier depends on the continuance of trade to and between the zones.4. The negotiation is therefore in an untidy shape and some of the documents themselves are loosely drafted.The grant of further economic and financial assistance to Spain hasbeen made dependent on a satisfactory provisional settlement of the Tangierquestion.6. It is now for decision whether in the last resort we should accept thearrangement as it now stands or whether we should hold out for clearer assurancesand cancel our economic and financial offer in the event of refusal.7.   In favour of accepting the position, it may be said that (a) even if we get the changes in the text which we should like it is doubtfulwhether they would be worth much more in practice, though theywould look better on paper. It will probably be unnecessary to publish the texts of this provisional arrangement; and there is sufficientmaterial for a satisfactory public statement to be made;(b) if we were to stand out and cancel our offer of economic assistance it isprobable that the position of the British community in Tangier, thedisplaced officials, and our commercial interests would be worse offthan if we were to close with the Spaniards on the basis now reached;(c) if we stand firm, we shall be accused of trying to starve Spain intoyielding over Tangier;(d) if, as seems likely, the war spreads to North Africa in the near future, theprovisional arrangement about Tangier will have relatively smallimportance, whereas the general attitude of Spain may be of greatimportance.8. The arguments for not accepting the present arrangements are mainly of a moral and political character, but in view of the degree of success which hasbeen obtained in the negotiations, these do not seem to outweigh the practical reasons in favour of acceptance. It should be noted that the United States havenow begun to send wheat to Spain.9. I therefore suggest that Sir S. Hoare should be instructed to make afurther strong effort, between now and the time when the credit agreement is ready for signature, to obtain&apos; (a) satisfactory amendments of the paragraphs in the memorandum dealingwith capitulations and the press, and- (6) some form of words added to either one or other of Senor Suner&apos;s twoletters, linking up, however tenuously, the paragraph aboutcapitulations in Sir S. Hoare&apos;s letter and the paragraph aboutcapitulations in the memorandum.The new credit agreement will not be signed without further reference back;but I would propose, in the last resort, to authorise signature on the basis of thepresent arrangements even if Sir S. Hoare has been unable to secure any improvement in the existing texts.A. E.Foreign Office, February 3, 1941.
&apos;&apos;^&apos;w &apos; Draff Telegram to Madrid, February 194f:; &apos;   &quot;? &quot;&apos; :1  *;      YOUR telegram^No. 163 [ofe28fehcJanuary].    :   -        -&apos;:.! (i.)The position is admittedly unsatisfactory since the present written documentsare untidy in shape, while., the memorandum; is loosely&quot; draf ted land lends itselfto evasion. I realise, however, -the difficulty in the peculiar circumstances ofsecuring alterations in the text, and also that our main requirements have been covered in one way or another if any reliance can be placed on Spanish good faith.2. Please make further strong effort between now and the time when the credit agreement is ready for signature to obtain (a) satisfactory amendments of the paragraphs in the memorandum dealingwith capitulations and the press; and(b) some form of words added to either one or other of Sefior Suner&apos;s twoletters linking up, however tenuously, the paragraph about capitula-tions in your letter and the paragraph about capitulations in thememorandum. The paragraph about capitulations in the memo-randum is more important, since this is the operative paragraph, andit is more essential that it should be in the right terms than thatSefior Sufier should refer to the question in his covering letter.3. Please report what progress on the foregoing lines you have been ableto make when the loan agreement is ready for signature. I will then instructyou as to whether or not you may sign.
