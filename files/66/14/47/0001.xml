The Marshal has madeseveral gestures since he sacked Laval on the 13th December. He got rid ofBaudouin, he went to meet Laval, he dismissed Alibert and Belin, and, in forminghis Consultative Council, he omitted the Grand Rabbi : the first time since the days of Napoleon that the Jewish religion has not been represented in such a body.   These various gestures have availed nothing.2. Marshal Petain has been working to bring about the unity of France andthe French Empire under himself. His prestige in France is great, and he felthe had the whole of France behind him. This does not, of course, suit the Germanbook. The Germans want to divide France against itself, in the first instance, inthe hope that unity within the German orbit may be achieved later under Lavalor another of their creatures. They have formed a French Nazi party whoseprogramme might have been written in Dr. Goebbels&apos;s office, and they haveinspired the Paris press to attack violently the men round Marshal Petain.3. Hitler&apos;s reply to Marshal Petain&apos;s message of the 24th January is saidto have reached Vichy. There are fairly reliable indications that what theGermans want are (i) The return of Laval.(ii) The surrender of Bizerta, the passage of German troops from Frenchmetropolitan ports to Tunis, and the use of the French fleet.It seems clear that this time they will not be content with any halLmeasures of collaboration.A. E.11286   [22199]
4. What will Marshal Petain do now ? His previous action in the face ofGerman demands points to his continuing to make certain concessions suchas the dismissal of Ministers. He may also agree to a more extended form ofeconomic collaboration.   He may be compelled to bring Laval back.5. Would the Germans be satisfied with the above? The answer depends on whether they are in such a hurry to get Bizerta that they are unable to Wait.If they can wait a little, they will probably give Laval a time-limit within which to deliver the goods which they require.6. If the outcome of the crisis is that Laval returns and the Marshal remains at the head of the Government, the question arises whether he will agree to the surrender of bases to the Germans and their use of the French fleet. He has givenus assurances through M. Rougier and through Mr. Dupuy that France will notcede air or naval bases or the French fleet to the Axis Powers, and that france would resist, by force of arms in North Africa, any attempt on the part of the spaniards, Germans or Italians to seize her colonies. Mr. Dupuy was told by admiral Darlan that, if the German pressure became irresistible, the french would invite us in time to take the bases over; Admiral Darlan expressed hisconfidence that the French ships would have time to leave Metropolitan France;if not, they would scuttle themselves. This attitude is borne out by the reportedinterview with Admiral Darlan given by the Lyons radio on the 3rd February.The correspondent concerned summed up Admiral Darlan&apos;s declarations withthese words : &quot;I can assert that the French Navy remains and shall remainFrench; that she will defend herself, and she will defend the Empire againstanybody, against any attack, from wherever it may come.&quot;7. On the other hand, we have had a very reliable report that AdmiralDaiian is helping our enemies with at least advice. Yet it is hard to believethat any French sailor could endure to see his ships passing into German handsin order to help to save the despised Italians from destruction. We have had goodreports of Admiral de Laborde who commands the French Mediterranean fleet and of Admiral d&apos;Harcourt at Casablanca. The possibility must, however, beconsidered that the Germans might not press the French fleet to depart fromits present passive role, but might insist on the surrender of Bizerta. Thiswould be for us a very dangerous outcome of the present crisis. Marshal Petainhas hitherto held out, while Admiral Esteva, the Governor of Tunis, recentlyexpressed the opinion to Mr. Murphy, the former United States Charge d&apos;Affairesat Vichy, that it was no longer possible for France to collaborate with theGermans, who were bent on nothing less than the scientific destruction of his country; the sole hope for the future of France lay in a British victory. Theman on the spot, therefore, seems to hold the right views and he is also under General Weygand&apos;s orders. I have, too, a certain faith in Marshal Petain/sstubbornness and his sense of honour, but it is questionable whether he will be physically strong enough to resist the constant stream of pressure to which hewill be exposed. His assets are his own prestige in France, the sentiment infavour of a British victory in both zones, and the support of General Weygandand the French forces overseas. General Weygand has already broadcast anappeal for confidence in the Marshal.8. If the Germans decide that the moment for action has come and thatthey can wait no longer, they may well decide to try to occupy Tunisia at once.They would at the same time take the facilities they require in French ports and perhaps leave a part of France still &quot; unoccupied,&quot; and I think they would try to secure the French fleet at Toulon in order to force the Mediterranean atonce. The Germans must know that General Weygand has only got sufficientmaterial for about six weeks. If the Germans are going to adopt this course,it is at least possible that they will allow Marshal Petain to remain nominallyin power, hoping that Laval will force him to send an order to General Weygandnot to resist. The Germans must know that General Weygand has his orders from Marshal Petain to carry on independently in certain circumstances. Theyare already attacking him in their press and wireless.9. Since the above was written reports from Vichy indicate that Laval hasdemanded from Marshal Petain very sweeping powers, involving the virtualdisappearance of Marshal Petain from the Government itself as a condition ofhis return.   Admiral Darlan, who is conducting the negotiations between the
Marshal at Vichy and Laval in Paris, is said to be bringing compromise proposals to Paris to-day, according to which Marshal Petain would continue as headof the State, but not head of the Government. Admiral Darlan would be PrimeMinister and Foreign Minister, with Laval as Vice-Premier and Minister of theInterior. Other reports say that a Triumvirate will be formed, the third memberof which would be General Huntziger. If this should prove to be the result ofthe crisis -though Laval may well dig his toes in and insist on being Presidentof the Council-dt will mean that the Germans will have considerably strengthened !their hold over the whole of France. Laval will press on the nazification of thecountry, but the question would remain open whether Admiral Darlan andGeneral Huntziger would go so far beyond the armistice terms as to surrenderbases and the French fleet. There are indications that the Germans intend tostrengthen their control over the French Empire. They have two emissaries in syria, and they recently sent a large commission to Casablanca. One of the firstacts of Laval will probably be to try to secure the recall of General Weygand.Foreign Office, February 6, 1941.
