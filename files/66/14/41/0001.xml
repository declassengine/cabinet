During the past two years it has been urged with everincreasing insistence by the Chinese Government, who see in it an essentialmeans for the conveyance among other things of heavy goods and armamentsfrom the outside world, now that other channels of communication have beensuccessively closed by the Japanese. The Chinese have in fact begun work on theChinese section. Although it is estimated that the railway will take some years to complete, General Chiang Kai-shek has recently urged us to agree withoutfurther delay to collaborate in the project as part of our programme of assistanceto China.2. In a recent appreciation of the Far Eastern situation the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, recommended, both as a means of encouraging China and of facilitating closer military co-operation with China in the event of war between japan and the British Empire, that we should push on with the development of communications between Burma and China.3. The Far Eastern Committee recently considered this question and the weight of opinion was in favour of a railway being built. The Committee feltthat this could be justified on political and strategic grounds. From the politicalangle it was agreed that the railway is highly desirable. Strategically it isessential to keep the Japanese involved in China to the maximum possible extent,and a favourable reply to the Chinese request for our support in constructing therailway would give much needed moral encouragement to the Chinese. Thetemporary alternative of a road on the proposed railway alignment has beenconsidered, but the width of track required for a railway is less than that required for a road, and this alternative would therefore both add to the cost and delay the construction of the railway.4. During the past year and a half, owing to our own war efforts, we havenot been able to give all the practical assistance we might have wished to theChinese, and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Chungking has expressed the hopethat His Majesty&apos;s Government may be able to reconsider the question of this railway, on which he says the Chinese have set their hearts. His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Tokyo also hopes that we can help China in this matter as it mayserve as a deterrent to southward movement by Japan. The Committee have notedthese views and believe that such risk as may. exist of annoying the Japaneseby embarking on a long-term project of linking two undeveloped territories isslight and is one that can very reasonably be faced.5. Since the Burma Government are unable to finance the project out oftheir own resources, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to undertake to meet11281   [22167]
the cost of construction in Burma (110 miles as compared with some 500 miles in China) as well as any net loss incurred in the operation of the Burmese sectionof the line.6. The sum required for the construction of the Burma section of therailway was estimated a year ago at  1,875,000 (including about  190,000 for the big bridge over the Sal ween). It is not possible, without more detailed surveysthan are yet available, to make any close estimate of costs : but with the rise inprices it would not be safe to put the total figure at less than  2,250,000. Thiswould include the cost of rails and bridging material, which it may be difficult in present conditions to supply from British sources. The Chinese Government,however, have at present lying at Rangoon rails for 132 kilometres, and it issuggested that they should be persuaded to allow these rails to be laid on the burmese section, and to finance, out of the United States dollar credits grantedto China by the United States Government, the purchase of bridging material and further rails to the extent to which these prove to be unobtainable in the sterling area. In return, a share in the eventual profits of the Burma section,or the supply of material to an equivalent value, when it can be arranged fromBritish Empire sources, might be offered to the Chinese Government.7. The building of the Burma section would only be justified if the&quot;ChineseGovernment were prepared to undertake as soon as possible the completion of thesection in Chinese territory to Kunming. It would also be necessary to stipulate that the frontier between Burma and China should be delimited satisfactorily.8. If the Cabinet approves, it is suggested that the Chinese Governmentshould be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to provide thefinance necessary for the construction of the section in Burma, provided that theChinese Government are willing to (1) agree to a delimitation of a frontier satisfactory to the Government of burma;(2) undertake the construction as soon as possible of the section of the line from the Burma frontier to Kunming out of their own resources or outof dollar credits available to them in the United States;(3) provide any rails and bridging materials which have to be financed in dollars for the Burma section in return for an appropriate share of future profits, or for the supply of an equivalent amount of material from British sources when supplies are available.The above conditions are regarded as essential from the British point of view,but it would appear desirable also to obtain permission for British interests to investigate the mineral possibilities in the neighbourhood of the railway with aview to participation in their development at a later date.9. If the Chinese Government accept these general proposals the detailed arrangements for the financing, construction and operation of the line would haveto be worked out more fully with them; and in the interests of efficiency it should,if possible, be arranged that the construction, and eventually the operation, of therailway in Chinese territory should be entrusted by the Chinese Government toa Sino-British-American company, which would be authorised to engage expertforeign engineering and accounting staff to supervise the work. In themeantime, the Burma Government should be invited to proceed at once with thecompletion of the survey of the Burma section, and they should be assured that HisMajesty&apos;s Government will provide finance for this purpose.10. It would be primarily for the Chinese Government to approach theUnited States for any credits required, but it would be advisable for us to keepthe United States Government informed as to our policy and concert with them as regards the detailed arrangements to be made.11. An urgent decision is required, as a Mission from Burma has been dispatched to Chungking to seek a solution of certain other Sino-Burmesequestions, and it will be impossible for them to complete their own task unless a definite answer is given to the Chinese Government with regard to the railwayproject.12.
