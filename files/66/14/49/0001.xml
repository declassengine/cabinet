President of the Council  (Chairman).The Minister of Labour and National Service.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.The First Lord of the Admiralty.Til-? Minister of Information,, -The Attorney General,to consider what further action,  if any, should be  takenin regard to the Communist Party (W.M.(4l)5th Conclusion,Minute 8)BThe Committee have now completed their reviewof the position,  and submit the following conclusionsfor    the approval of the War Cabinet.2o It was always assumed that,  if the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;were suppressed,  there would be an increase in theamount of Communist propaganda carried on by thedistribution of leaflets among workpeople in fsctoriesand elsewhere.      There are already signs of such anincrease in the distribution of Communist leaflets;    andthe Committee are satisfied that,  as a corollary to the suppression of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;,  it is necessaryto establish control over the publication of leafletsintendedt to be used as propagands in relation to thewarDThe existing Defence Regulations ctain nosuitable provisions for this purpose,  and the committee therefore propose a new Regulation which would havethe following effect

It would be an offence to publish&quot;any leaflet which is calculated to undermine or disrupt the unity of purpose necessary to ensure themaximum war effort from allclasses of the community&quot;o&quot;Leaflet&apos;:1 would, include a pamphlet,circular- or postefT, hut not a newspaper or a bookoIt would be an offence to publishor distribute any leaflet intended .or likely to be used as propaganda in relation tc the war or to the makingo f pe a s e veil ess (i)    it bo re thename and address of the printerand the person responsible for it,and (ii)    three copies had beensubmitted to the Rome Office atleast seventy--two hours beforepubI o c at i on or distributionoAny person who:. with intent to commit an offence against the regulation,, had in his possessionor Tinder his control any leafletwithin the meaning of (a) or (b)above would be guilty of an offence.Provision would be made forexempting leaflets,  either individuallyor as a class...   from the controloutlined in Jb) abovecA draft of the proposed Regulations is attached.3. The prop:sea provisions for the control overthe publication cf leaflets ore not more severe thanthose which were ih force during the last warunder Regulation 27 C of the Defence of the RealmRegulationscAlthough it js proposed to require leafletsto he submitted to the Home Office before publication,objection raised by the Home Office to thepublication cf a particular leaflet will not initself made the publication of that leaflet an offence against the lawk,      An offence will be involved only if the leaflet contravenes the provisionssummarised in paragraph. .2 (a)   above and thatwill be a question to be determined by the courts.The advantage of the proposed control is that itwill enable the Homo Office to know in advance whatleaflets are about to be published,  and. to warn theprinters and publishers when,-  in their view,  aparticular leaflet contravenes the provisionsof the Regulation-      In such a case,  the police   willbe advised tc so220 all stocks, of the leafletunder Defence Regulation 83A (2):    and,  in caseswhere the person responsible accepts the view ofthe Home Office,   there will be no need to takeproceedings before the court?      If, however,  that(a)(d)

- 0 i\U uview is challengedo proceedings will be taken under the regulation in order that the defendant may have anopportunity of stating his case,  and that a court may decide whether the leaflets in fact contravene theprovisions of the Segalationso      By this means itwill be possible to combine the advantages of (i)preventive seizure of objectionable leaflets inadvance of their publication and (ii) preservation of theright of access to the courts by authors or publisherswho desire to challenge the action of the Executive.4, The Committee were inclined to think that,  inorder to preserve Parliamentary control,  the validity ofthis Regulation should be limited in the first instance to a period cf three morvthSo      Parliament would then beable to consider,  when three months have elapsed,whether the  situation is such as to require thecontinuance of these special measures;     and could,  if desired^  debate that issue on a Prayer against thenew Order-in-Council required to renew the Regulation,.If the War Cabinet approve the general lines ofthe prop sed new Regulation,   the Home Secret-ary will consult informally with representative Members of theHouse of Commons before the Regulation is made0A paragraph limiting in time the validity of the regulation will be added if,  in the course of thenegotiations,  it is found that the Members consultedwould favour such a limitation05a The Committee have considered whether,  inaddition to the action taken or recommended inrespect of publications,  any further action of a general character should be taken at   present against theCommunist Party - either by way of declaring the Partyillegal,  or by adopting a policy of interningpersons on the ground of Communist activities^The Committee took steps to obtain the views ofthe Production Executive on this questionc      after considering the results of enquiries made at their request by the Supply Departments and the Ministryof Labour,  the Production Executive came to thefollowing conclusions;-&quot;(a)    There is no definite evidence thatCommunist activity has so far had a serious effect on the output of war industries^  thoughCommunists have probably in some  cases had abad influence by discouraging workingafter the alert or on overtime and in similarways ri(b) The workers are not likely to beaggrieved by any action taken againstCommunists who are not themselvesworking in factories,  he:  leaders andorganisers among the &quot;Intelligentsia&quot;*(c) Any action taken against workers inthe factories on the ground that they areCommunists would lead to complaints ofvictimisation and would cause discontent among workers who are not themselves in

sympathy with Cornmunisnu      In particular $discontent would be caused by any systemof espionage to discover what workers are members of the Communist Party.(d)    It is recommended that the Provision inregard to circulation of pamphlets should bostrengthened^      There is no reason tobelieve that action of this kind wouldhave any undesirable repercussions&quot;.Having regard to the conclusions reached by the ProductionExecutivey  and to the other evidence made available to themby the Home Defence (Security) Executive and otherwise^ theCommittee are of opinion that it is not necessary at thepresent time to comtemplate any general action againstthe Communist Party, -apart from the measures already taken or recommended in respect of publications.      TheHome Secretary will, of course,  retain full liberty to take action against individuals whose activities are prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm,6^&apos; There are, however, two specific matters whichthe Committee desire to bring to the notice of theWar Cabinet:-(a) Although the Production Executive aresatisfied that the activities ofCommunists in the factories do not in generalgive cause for alarm at the present time,  theCommittee have had evidence from the HomeDefence (Security) Executive suggesting that Communist agitators are causing a good dealof unrest among seamen in the sea-porttowns.      It has been arranged that theSecurity Services will submit to the HomeOffice particular cases where there is good reason to believe that an individual -intends to visit a port for the purposeof stirring up trouble among seamen;and,  if the Home Secretary is satisfied that thisis in fact the man&apos;s intention, he will be preparedto make an Order under Defence Regulation 18Aprohibiting him from entering that area, on theground that  such a restriction is necessary&quot;for the purpose of preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the public safety orthe defence of the realm&quot;.      The First Lord ofthe Admiralty is anxious that,  in proper cases,such persons should   be excluded from seaporttowns where they might be able to obtain information about the sailings,  and routeing,of ships which might be useful to the enemy:    and,while it is recognised that there are cases in which it would be inexpedient to invoicethese powers (e.g. where the prohibition of access to a particular area would deprive a man of hismeans of livelihood)  it is hoped that these

^  *jactivities may be kept within reasonable boundsif the Security Services are able to produce in a number of case s such evidence as would justify the making of an Order under this regulation(b)    Since the outbreaic of war, the communists have adopted a policy ofdispersing prominent members of the Partyinto industry,-, where they can avail themselves of direct opportunities to exploitgrievances and foment disaffection amongthe workers*      The Committee have beenInformed that in pursuance of thispoi^ cy a considerable number of well-knownCommunists have succeeded in obtaining positions in aircraft factorieso      It is understood,for example,  that Ben Francis is employed as a timekeeper at the works of theGloucester Aircraft Company,  and that WalHarrington has obtained a post at theSwift Seale Company works in London and isCha:; vman of the Shop Stewards Committee.The Minister of Labour is in a position to   quoteother cases in which prominent Communists have obtained well paid posts in aircraft factories,where they   are in a position to exercise anunwholesome influence on the workers*The Committee find it difficult to understandv/hy men who are known   -   in some cases notorious - asCommunists should be able,  apparently without difficulty,   to obtain positions in factories engagedin vital war production.-,(Intld-j)   J.A;Privy Council Office:10TH FEBRUARY,  1941
