Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) 17.January 29, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE IMPORTS SITUATION.AIDE-MEMOIRE.Importing Capacity.SINCE the outbreak of war we have lost about 2 million gross tons moreshipping than we have built or captured. This has been approximately made good by bringing home British ships normally trading abroad and by buying andchartering Allied and neutral ships, which now work for us full-time insteadof part-time as formerly. Thus the total shipping effectively at our disposal isabout the same as in peace-time.Formerly nearly half our imports came from European countries and thenorth coast of Africa. These sources no longer being available, and the Mediter-ranean being practically closed to merchant shipping, we are forced to import frommore distant sources and the average haul is increased by about half. In addition,the time of turn-round in port has been increased by black-out and other war-timedifficulties and by the concentration of unloading in the Western ports. Thesetwo causes together with convoy delays make the average round voyage last about1-1 times as long as formerly. Hence if nothing else intervened we should be ableto import some two-thirds of the normal amount.In addition, however, it has been necessary to divert about one-sixth of ourimporting capacity to the fighting services, a factor which has been increased bythe campaign in the Middle East. Thus it seems likely that we shall not be ableto import even two-thirds of the normal amount. Indeed, if sinkings continue at their present level our merchant fleet, which has been maintained largely bywindfalls in the shape of French, Norwegian, Danish ships, &amp;c, will diminishand our importing capacity will be even further reduced. This would gravelyimperil our war effort.Requirements.In 1937 we imported, apart from oil, about 60 million tons of goods. In thesecond year of war we estimate minimum requirements at some 40 million tons.This is 4 million tons less than our imports during the first year of war, whichwere already much reduced owing to our loss of Baltic sources and other war-timedifficulties. The minimum requirements involve reducing food from 23 million tons in peace-time to about 16 millions, and other imports from 37 to 24 millions.1. Materials.In order to achieve this reduction, timber imports will be diminished by7\ million tons, paper and pulp by 2-J million tons, cotton, wool, &amp;c, by[22160]
1 million tons, and miscellaneous materials and manufactures by 4 million tons.Timber losses can be made good only in part by extensive felling; paper is downto \; textiles, despite the need for uniforms, &amp;c, are halved; manufactures,other than munitions and machine tools, have virtually vanished.Steel for home civil needs has been cut to about one-half and for exports toone-third of pre-war rates, our civil consumption thus being reduced to about one-fifth of that of the United States per head of the population. We hope to save about 3 million tons by importing steel in place of iron-ore. But the demands for munitions are so great that a net increase of 2 million tons in metal and oreimports is inevitable.All these items together make a net cut of 13 million tons.2. Food.It is reckoned that the minimum food import required to maintain efficiencyis about 16 million tons, 70 per cent, of the 23 million tons imported before thewar. This involves cutting animal feeding-stuffs by about 4 million tons, whichwill reduce our stock of meat on the hoof, the safest kind of stock in case of air attacks. It will, of course, also reduce our supplies of bacon, eggs and dairyproduce, already greatly depleted by the collapse of the Continent, but everyeffort is being made to maintain the children&apos;s milk supply which depends uponimported oil cake. It also implies increased imports of fertilisers essential to augment our home food production.We plan to reduce fruit and vegetable imports from 2-1 million to half amillion tons, and to cut 1 million tons of other foods, such as sugar, meat, butter,eggs, &amp;c.The consumption per head in December compared with pre-war rates isshown below for a few food-stuffs :  Butter     ......     29% of pre-war. Tea ......     83% of pre-war.All fats   ......     81% ,.       ,,      Bacon and ham ...     82% ,.Sugar      ......     76% ,,      Other meat       ...     86% ,,It is evident that we cannot cut much further without reducing the stamina and morale of the people.Outlook.In normal times the amount imported in September, October, November and december is about one-third of the amount of imports in a full year. In the last four months we have got in less than 12 million tons, corresponding to only35 million in the full year quite apart from further sinkings. Unless we can get in 40 million, i.e., 16 million of food and 24 of other supplies, we shall have tomake cuts which will definitely reduce our war-making capacity.January 29, 194.1.
