naval OPERATIONS.General Review,There has been a decrease in the shipping losses reported and in the numberof U-Boats operating, though enemy aircraft have been active in attacking tradein the North-Western Approaches and on the East Coast.The German battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau have been sightedat sea.Home Waters.2. The Home Fleet sailed on the 25th January and proceeded South of iceland. Early on the 27th H.M.S. Naiad sighted 2 unknown ships on an easterlycourse to the east of her, but lost sight of them almost at once when one of themmade smoke. The area was searched by ships and aircraft on the 27th and 28th,but nothing was sighted and the Fleet returned on the 30th.Five Norwegian merchant ships broke out from the Skagerrack and wereescorted to Kirkwall by H.M. Ships Naiad and Aurora and destroyers. The S.S.Ranja, tanker 6,355 tons, was in ballast and the 4 other ships totalling 21,897 tonshad cargoes of high grade Swedish steel. The escorting forces and convoy wereunsuccessfully attacked by enemy aircraft; the only casualty was the First Officerof the S.S. Ranja, who was severely wounded by machine-gun fire.On the 23rd H.M. armed boarding vessel Northern Gift intercepted theFinnish S.S. Wisa (3,846 tons) proceeding from Petsamo to New York and senther to Reykjavik for examination.3. On the 23rd H.M. Destroyer Valorous, escorting an east coast convoy off Lowestof t, engaged a,nd drove off 3 E-Boats which did not return the fire.4. A photographic reconnaissance of the Hipper class cruiser in dock at brest on the 26th showed the dock being flooded. PI.M.S. Kenya and2 destroyers carried out a sweep of the Western part of the Channel to intercepther should she proceed to sea, but nothing was sighted. Further air reconnaissancewas unsuccessful owing to weather conditions.5. Six enemy merchant ships were sighted off Ushant steering north-easton the 28th, and H.M. Destroyers Kashmir and Kipling were sent to interceptbut were unable to locate them.6. The Town class destroyers (ex U.S.S.) Newmarket and Richmond, and h.M. Canadian destroyers Assiniboine, Restigouche, Columbia (ex U.S.S.), and at . Francis (ex U.S.S.) arrived from Canada on the 26th.7. H.M. Destroyer Westcott was damaged in collision with H.M. CorvetteBluebell on 28th January when escorting an outward bound convoy in the North-Western Approaches, but was able to reach her base under her own steam.North Atlantic.8. H.M.S. King George V arrived at Chesapeake Bay on the 24th with lord Halifax on board, and sailed shortly afterwards.Mediterranean.9. H.M.S. Illustrious, escorted by four destroyers, sailed from Malta p.m.23rd and arrived at Alexandria on the 25th. On the night before she sailedMalta was again raided, but no damage was caused or casualties suffered.A force of cruisers and destroyers, supported by battleships, covered herpassage. On the 24th the cruiser force was attacked when 130 miles north ofBenghazi by about 30 enemy aircraft, the larger proportion being dive-bombers.Many near misses were obtained, but no damage was sustained by our ships.Four or five of the enemy aircraft were damaged. The enemy aircraft missedsighting the Illustrious.The Greek submarine Papanicolis claims to have sunk 3 Italian merchant ships on the 24th.
On the 27th January 6 Swordfish, escorted by 2 Fulmar aircraft of theF.A.A., attacked a south-bound enemy convoy of 3 ships about 120 miles fromTripoli. A merchant ship of 4,000 tons was sunk and one of 6,000 tons damaged,both by torpedoes.Air reconnaissance reported that an enemy merchant vessel of about,000 tons while approaching Tripoli Harbour on the 29th was seen to strikewhat appeared to be a mine. There was a large explosion, and the ship was last seen well down by the bows and surrounded by small craft from the harbour.10. A channel has been swept in Tobruk harbour which is now open to traffic.The Italian cruiser San Georgio and the S.S. Marco Polo (12,272 tons) are completely gutted, and there are a number of sunken vessels in the harbour. TheArmy is proceeding with the installation of A/A and coast defences, pendingthe completion of which H.M. Monitor Terror is remaining as guard ship.11. Three French submarines passed Gibraltar west bound on the 28th, and during the week 9 French merchant vessels passed east bound and 9 westbound, all under escort.A Glen Martin aircraft reconnoitred Gibraltar on the 20th, 21st and 24th,being driven off by A/A fire on the 20th.Egypt.12. The 8th Convoy from Australia and New Zealand, with approximately16,000 troops, arrived at Suez on the 28th. There were 13 Transnorts, totalling153,164 tons.Other Foreign Stations.13. An aircraft from a raider is believed to have bombed the british.S. Mandasor, 5,144 tons, 300 miles East of the Seychelles on the 24th January.A search of the area has been carried out by cruisers, but so far without result.HM. Ships Hermes and Enterprise intercepted the French S.S. Sontay,8,912 tons, proceeding from Saigon to Dakar and Marseilles. An armed guardwas placed on board and the ship is being escorted to Simonstown.The French S.S. Mendoza (intercepted on the 18th) arrived under escort atAscension Island on the 27th.The Swedish S.S. Oscar Gorthon sighted an armed raider with a prize in company on the 27th to the eastward of the Ladrone Islands in the Pacific Ocean.Anti-Submarine Operations.14. During the period under review three attacks on U-boats were made by surface craft, one attack by H.M. Corvette arab is being promising. other attacks were made by H.M. Destroyer Antelope and the A/S Trawler Buttermere.Enemy Intelligence.German.15. Weather has been unfavourable to air reconnaissance for the greaterpart of the past week. The Hipper Class cruiser was last sighted at Brest on the26th January, when her dry dock was being flooded. A reconnaissance ofWilhelmshaven shows the battleship Tirpitz still in the port.It was reported that on the 23rd January the battle cruisers Gneisenau andScharnhorst were seen passing through the Great Belt northward bound, and therehave been indications of enemy surface craft to the east of Iceland, but there isno evidence whether these are the battle cruisers or some other units.Italian.16. There has been little news of Italian main units in the past week. the battleship Vittorio Veneto, which is possibly the only battleship at present;operating, the others being in dockyard hands, was reported to have been at
Spezia on the 13th January. On the 29th 3 cruisers were reported by air reconnaissance at Palermo, and one Pola-class cruiser was escorting a southboundconvoy of 3 merchant ships off Lampedusa (S.W. of Malta).U-Boats.17. Two to three Italian and 5 to 6 German U-Boats have been operating in the North-Western Approaches during the week, and according to the latest estimate at least one of the German U-Boats is returning. In the Azores-Canariesand North-West Africa area there have been two or three Italians and probablyone German. The Italian U-Boat which entered Las Palmas on the 20th Januaryleft in the early hours of the 24th January.Raiders.18. The raider situation is again obscure. Two raider reports have come in from a position 700 miles west of Freetown on the 29th January, and it isthought that this may be the ship which sank the s.s. British Union on the18th January, though it is possible that this may be a new arrival.In the South Atlantic there have been a number of D/F bearings whichindicate at least two ships, but whether they are raiders or supply ships is not clear. A raider has been active in the Southern Ocean, where she probablycaptured three Whale Faxtory ships and their catchers on the 14th and15th January.There may be a total of six raiders active at present :  One in North Atlantic.One or more in South Atlantic (these might be supply ships).One in the Southern Ocean.One in the Indian Ocean.Two in the Pacific.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.19. During the period the 22nd to 29th January 5 ships, a total of12,518 tons, have been reported lost by enemy action, all of which were British.One ship (4,980 tons) was sunk by U-Boat, but this is a delayed report from december. Two ships (6,286 tons) were sunk by aircraft in the North-Western Approaches, and 2 ships (1,252 tons) by mines. Twenty-seven ships, 19 ofwhich are British, are reported damaged, 18 of them by enemy aircraft attack.Full details are given in Appendix I.20. A homeward-bound convoy was attacked by a U-Boat early on the 29thin the North-Western Approaches, and it is known that 3 ships (14,407 tons)were torpedoed and sunk, but these are not included in the above figures.Focke Wulfe Condor aircraft were operating on the 23rd, 28th and 29th inthe North-Western Approaches, and several attacks on shipping were made. Onthe 29th a Sunderland flying-boat, while escorting a convoy, engaged, damaged and drove off one of these aircraft.East Coast convoys were attacked several times on the 26th, and theS.S. Meriones, which was aground on the Ffaisboro Sand shoal, was set on fire.Four of the attacking aircraft were shot down by the escorting ships and one bythe merchant ships&apos; guns.Protection of Seaborne Trade.21. During the week ended noon Wednesday, the 29th January, 665 ships,including 111 Allied and 18 Neutral, were convoyed, of which two were lost by enemy action. Since the start of the war 216 ships have been lost in convoy, or1 ship in every 240. Two Battleships, 7 Armed Merchant Cruisers, 39 Destroyers,37 Sloops and corvettes and 1 Submarine were employed on escort duties.
22. Owing to two convoys being delayed by the weather, imports intoGreat Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 25th Januarytotalled only 474,190 tons compared with 764,232 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 668,130 tons for the previous ten weeks. Oil imports, innine tankers, totalled 97,105 tons compared with 179,075 tons during the weekending the 18th January. Mineral imports were 155,229 tons, of which120,481 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron, and iron ore. The corresponding figures for the previous seven days were 285,439 tons and 189,678 tons. Timberimports were 29,319 tons and cereal imports 73,321 tons, eight ships being fullyladen with grain. Other food imports were 74,104 tons, of which 22,999 tons were sugar and molasses. Among the imports were satisfactory quantities of aircraft, lorries and other war material.British Minelaying.23. No minelaying has been undertaken in the past week except for 50 mineslaid by H.M. Submarine Cachalot off the Norwegian Coast to the North ofStadtlandet on the 27th January.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.24. Minelaying enemy aircraft have not been very active this week, probablyowing to the weather. They were reported off Milford Haven on the night of the22nd/23rd January, in the upper Bristol Channel on the evening of the28th January, and over the Thames Estuary towards the end of the week.Four ships, including two LL Trawlers, have been sunk by mine, and three,including one LL Trawler, have been damaged. Two were sunk in the Humber,two in the Thames Estuary, two were beached in the Bristol Channel and one was damaged off Milford Haven.Twenty-two magnetic or acoustic mines have been detonated in the Humberduring the week. These were probably laid during the nights of the 15th and16th January. Fifteen of the mines were detonated by S.A. Gear, six by L.L.and one by Skid. Eight mines have been detonated off Liverpool, five in theupper Thames Estuary, four off Milford Haven, two in the Tyne, one in the upperBristol Channel and one off Falmouth.A considerable number of German conical anti-sweeping explosive containershave been washed ashore in the Aberdeen area. This would seem to indicatethat enemy mines had been laid thereabouts, but sweeping has not so farconfirmed this.The mine totals are : contact 795, magnetic 882, acoustic 186.Mediterranean.25. In the Mediterranean a small area has been declared dangerous due to enemy mines some twenty-four miles south of Pantellaria. Greek submarineshave reported single wires scraping against their hulls, thought to be minemoorings, in half a dozen different positions in the southern Adriatic.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.26. The S.S. Munsterland, 6,408 tons, speed 12 knots, sailed from Kobe onthe 26th January. She has been extensively repaired, and both the upper and lower bridges have been totally enclosed.The tanker S.S. Charlotte Schliemann, 7,747 tons, is reported to have pro-vided the damaged Italian submarine which went in to Las Palmas with drums of gas oil fuel.Italian. .27. The S.S. Burma, 2,896 tons, which was in Cadiz, was reported to havebeen blown ashore near Puerto di Santa Maria on the night of the 21st/22ndJanuary, and was likely to become a total wreck.
MILITARY SITUATION.Balkan States.AIbania.28. On the Albanian front a number of Italian counter attacks were made and were successfully repulsed by the Greeks, who have captured a quantity ofprisoners and war material.Hungary.29. The visit to Berlin of General Bartha, the Minister of War, possiblyheralds a closer measure of co-operation between the Hungarian and german armies. Although there are at present no definite indications of the form this connection-operation will take, the Germans are reported to be demanding complete controlof the Hungarian railways, and the Hungarians the recovery of the remainder of Transylvania.Roumania.30. German troop movements into Roumania continue on a heavy scale, andit is believed that a minimum of 10 divisions, including three or four armouredand two motorised divisions, are now in the country. The total may well be considerably higher. The concentration in the Dobruja appears to be extending,and it is possible that four divisions, including an armoured and motoriseddivision, may now be in this area. There is no reason to suppose that the troop movements into Roumania are drawing to a close.Bulgaria.31. It is now established that at least four infantry divisions have left theTurkish frontier. These divisions have been replaced by troops from the mobiledivisions. The infantry divisions have left certain reservists behind, which may give rise to the belief that these divisions are still on the frontier.32. A commercial company at Sofia has received an order to build barrackaccommodation to the value of 15 million leva at Krumovo (near Plovdiv), and inthe vicinity of Varna, Burgas and Trnovo. There has been no evidence of previous lack of barrack accommodation in these places.33. Weather has improved throughout the country and is now mild. Snowis disappearing, and the roads, even across mountain passes, are probablypassable, though they would deteriorate rapidly if used by continuous heavytraffic. Night frosts keep the ground hard. West of Ruschuk barges are nowusing the Danube freely, and an icebreaker is in action. If present conditionscontinue the river should soon be ice-free.34. Curtailments in passenger services on the Bulgarian railways came intoforce on the 19th January and are to last for six weeks. They are variouslyexplained by the authorities as being due to the necessity of repairing locomotives and as a measure necessitated by the shortage of coal or the state of the rolling-stock.Yugoslavia.35. Twenty railway waggons each containing 14-1.5 tons of rifles and rifleammunition emanating from Kragujevac arsenal are reported recently to have passed Carirod en route to Turkey. If this is true the Yugoslavs must considerthat they have ample reserves of rifles and rifle ammunition.36. During the past week the weather has been mild with occasional rain,and melting snow has caused flooding of rivers, particularly the southerntributaries of the Sava. The Danube is now completely free from ice, butnavigation has not recommenced. The temperature is now again falling andfrost is expected.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.44. Operations in Europe were restricted by extremely bad weather. Ourbombing operations were cancelled on four nights and those of the enemy on five nights.   Our main attacks were on Hanover and Wilhelmshaven.In Africa our aircraft gave support to our successful land operations on allfronts. German aircraft have been in action in Libya, but enemy air formationsare apparently being moved from Cyrenaica to Tripoli.Operational aircraft casualties and extracts from recent Raid AssessmentReports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied Territory.45. Unfavourable weather conditions again persisted. Bomber Commandflew three day and 59 night sorties, supported by two day and six night sortiesby Coastal aircraft.[22171] cAfrica.Libya.37. The number of prisoners taken at Tobruk has not been definitelyascertained but is known to include four generals and one admiral. The warmaterial captured includes 150,000 gallons of petrol. Our casualties for theoperations against Tobruk, previously reported as under 500, are now estimatedat under 300.38. Following the capture of Tobruk, our armoured troops advancedtowards Derna and on the 24th January were in touch with an enemy force astride the Bomba-Derna road, 10 miles South-East of Derna. Derna was captured onthe morning of the 30th January.Sudan.39. In the Kassala sector the Northern column of our forces has capturedBiscio and is now pushing on towards Agordat. On the evening of the25th January they were attacked by an enemy force which included 5 tanks. the attack was repulsed with considerable loss to the enemy.Our Southern column has now reached a point 2 miles North of Barentu.40. In the Gallabat sector the enemy have evacuated their position 3 miles .E. of the town of Gallabat and our forces are preparing to dislodge them fromtheir new position. Our forward positions have been attacked from the air, butthe damage caused was negligible.East Africa.41. Patrol activity continues along the frontier between Kenya and italian somaliland and our troops have reached the landing ground at British Moyale.Far East.42. As. a result of a Japanese offer of mediation in the Thailand-Indo-China hostilities, which has been accepted by both the French and the ThaiGovernments, an armistice was ordered to take effect from 1000 hours the28th January, but it is not yet definite that hostilities have finally ceased.43. The Japanese have not offered their services for love of the Thais orof the French and it is probable that they will require certain concessions from both sides. There has recently been an increase of Japanese naval activity inthe South China Seas, and this suggests that the Japanese will be ready to supportdemands with a show of force. Should the Japanese, as a result of these demands,succeed in establishing themselves in the southern ports of Indo-China such asCamranh Bay or Ream the threat to Singapore and Malaya will be increasedto the extent that the Japanese will have control of advanced sea bases withinapproximately 650 miles of Singapore and Borneo.
46. On the 24th January a Coastal Command Beaufort attacked the oil refinery at St. Nazaire, but was unable to observe results; another Beaufort atdusk on the 27th January made a reconnaissance of Brest, and dropped a para-chute mine which exploded near the Port Militaire. Efforts to see if the Hipperclass cruiser was still in the dry dock at Brest were not successful.Four Beauforts bombed the docks at Lorient on the night of the24th/25th January with inconclusive results. On the following night sixteenheavy bombers attacked the Main Post Office and Telegraph Office at Hanover.The weather was clear and all bombs fell in the target area, starting numerousfires.  Propaganda leaflets were also dropped.47. On the night of the 29th/30th January fifteen Wellingtons and fiveHampdens attacked the naval base, the dockyards and industrial targets willhelmshaven. Many explosions and fires were observed to the south, east andsouth-west of the Bauhafen, and the Main Railway Station is believed to havebeen hit. Later aircraft reported that the fires appealed to be growing in intensity.   Small fires only were reported from the industrial targets.Italy.48. Three Wellingtons from Malta attacked Capodichino aerodrome, atNaples, on the night of the 27th/28th January, and secured direct hits on buildings; two others bombed the Central Station, with its junction and goodsyards. Successful attacks were also made during the week on Catania andComino aerodromes in Sicily.United Kingdom.49. Fighter Command flew 155 patrols involving 351 sorties by day and one by night; hostile activity by day was reduced and consisted of a total of155 aircraft, of which 95 were engaged on reconnaissances. Raids by single aircraft were plotted during daylight in a number of widely separated districts.No interception by our fighters was effected, but two enemy aircraft were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. On five nights no bombing occurred, but,, on the night of the 25th/26th, attacks were made on the South-Western Counties and,on the 29th/30th, on East London.Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying.50. Aircraft of the Coastal Command were again badly hampered by weather conditions, but flew 133 patrols involving 373 sorties, of which 170 wereconvoy escorts. Routine patrols were carried out during the week off theNorwegian, German, Dutch, Belgian and French Coasts, and several attacks weremade on enemy merchant shipping and trawlers, with inconclusive results. Otheroffensive operations by Coastal Command aircraft have already been described.51. A Sunderland engaged a Condor on the 29th January 117 miles west of Achill Head and each was damaged; during the period a number of otherinconclusive fights took place. One Hudson is missing and another landed atSligo through shortage of fuel. Photographic reconnaissances were successful in the Bergen, Stavanger, Kiel, Wilhelmshaven, Brest, Morlaix and Finisterreareas, but many attempts had to be abandoned through bad visibility.52. Enemy coastal aircraft were extremely inactive, but the long-rangeCondor unit maintained its offensive patrols over the Atlantic.Malta.53. Only one attack was made on Malta, when a single aircraft droppedbombs at Luqa aerodrome, hitting a building and causing some casualties. an italian seaplane landed off Comino Island at night and was captured, the crewhaving mistaken Malta for their base.   - .
Greece, Albania and Dodecanese.54. During the week an Italian camp at Boulsar, thirty miles from Eibasan,was bombed by three Blenheims, a large fire resulting; military stores at Eibasanwere attacked by six Blenheims. Gladiators intercepted nine Italian bombersnear Kelcyre and destroyed one and damaged four. Two successful attacks weremade on Maritza aerodrome, Rhodes, and on another occasion our aircraft bombedRhodes Harbour, where fires were started.On the 29tn January, twenty-four enemy aircraft reconnoitred Crete and bombed Heraklion.Libya and Egypt.55. Our aircraft carried out repeated bombing attacks against dispersedaircraft and enemy landing grounds at Apollonia, Maraua, Sidi Magnum, Soluch,Barce and Derna. A number of aircraft were damaged on the ground and, atDerna, which was abandoned, fourteen unserviceable aircraft were later observed.Our fighters maintained offensive patrols over the battle area. Hurricanes shot down three Italian fighters near Mechili and destroyed one bomber on the ground.Fifteen Italian fighters engaged in machine-gunning our ground forces nearDerna were intercepted, and two of them were destroyed. Gladiators on aprotective patrol over the Mechili area engaged five Italian aircraft; oneGladiator is missing and two were damaged. Hurricanes machine-gunned enemymotor transport withdrawing from Mechili and inflicted severe casualties.56. On the 23rd six enemy bombers attacked our forces near Giarabubwithout inflicting damage or casualties, and on the following day twelve german aircraft, escorted by Italian fighters, dive-bombed our advanced armoured forcesnear Mechili and caused casualties. On the 29th/30th enemy aircraft, believed to be German, dropped bombs near the Suez Canal and on Shallufa aerodrome,but there were no Royal Air Force casualties or damage.Sudan and East Africa.57. Our bomber and reconnaissance aircraft in the Sudan attacked enemytrenches, dispersed aircraft and railheads in support of our land operations inEritrea. The railway track and station buildings, and mechanised transportvehicles at Biscia were hit and three direct hits were registered on Maatal railway station. Attacks were also made against Assab and Massawa,, and enemy ground forces were harassed at Jokau, Hobok, Keru, Tellina, Barentu, Agordat andUmm Hagar. Over Keru, four of our fighters intercepted three Italian bombersescorted by three fighters; one of the bombers was shot down and the remainingtwo were damaged.58. Native troops were machine-gunned on the Liboi-Afmadu road by theSouth African Air Force operating in Italian Somaliland.59. A Blenheim from Aden dropped a 1,000-lb. bomb on Duanle station, andAisha railway station was attacked three times. Both are on the Jibuti-addis ababa railway line. During this period no important air operations by theenemy have been reported.Air Intelligence.Germany.60. The total establishment of German Air Force units in the Mediterraneanis now estimated at about 450 aircraft, including 200 long-range bombers, 150dive-bombers, and 40 long-range fighters. About 50 aircraft have so far been lost.61. Of this force about 40 long-range bombers may be temporarily based in the Benghazi area and up to a further 40 long-range bombers are thought tobe at Benghazi or Rhodes. The remaining aircraft are probably based in Sicily,although the identification of transport traffic to Cagliari, Sardinia, points to thepossibility of a South Sardinian base being used for offensive operations.
62. German Air Force penetration in the guise of a &quot; mission &apos;&apos; to theRoumanian Air Force, has proceeded for some months. It is probable that morethan 200 operational aircraft are now located in Roumania.Italy.63. The Italians appear to be moving the greater part of their remainingbomber aircraft from the Eastern to the Western Sector of Libya. This movecoincides with indications that the Libyan Air Command and the headquarters of the 5th Air Corps are to be transferred westwards to Tripoli. The recentarrival of 50 Italian fighters at Castel Benito, Tripoli, from Italy has also beenreported. It is not known whether these aircraft are intended to strengthen the defences at Tripoli or if they are to be moved eastwards to take part in theforthcoming struggle for Benghazi.Greece.64. It appears probable that German aircraft have recently repeatedlyflown over Greek fortifications on the Bulgarian frontier.China.65. It is reported that damage done to the Mekong Bridge, on the burma road, by Japanese aircraft on the 19th January, was completely repaired and thebridge opened for all traffic within a few days. Although the spasmodic natureof Japanese attacks on this vital Chinese target may be in part due to weather conditions, it is probable that the Japanese now realise their inability to interruptthe route by bombing.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.66. There has been less enemy activity this week than at any time sinceintensive raids began last autumn. No serious incident occurred till the25th January, when seven people were killed at Yarmouth. On the 27th Januarysome damage was done to Messrs. Vickers Armstrongs Naval Yard at HighWalker, near Newcastle, and to a Ministry of Aircraft Production factory atGrantham, where fifteen people were killed. On the 28th January bombs were dropped in many places east of a line Humber-Test and in thirteen London boroughs. No serious damage was done and only one fatal casualty has beenreported. On the 29th single aircraft dropped bombs in the London area and atStockton-on-Tees without doing serious damage.By Night.67. Night raiding has been on a very small scale and on five nights of theweek no bombs were dropped. On the night of the 25th/26th damage was doneby Parachute Mines at St. Ives, Cornwall,- and at St. Eval aerodrome, where someR.A.F. personnel were killed.68. On the night of the 29th/30th activity was more widespread and bombs were dropped in Essex, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Surrey. One block of buildings at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was badly damaged; fourCadets were killed and eleven injured.69. In London seventeen incidents were reported, twelve of which were inthe Eastern part of the county. No serious damage was caused and, apart fromone incident at West Ham, where 20 people were injured, casualties were few.Casualties.70.   Estimated casualties are 55 killed and 180 injured.
