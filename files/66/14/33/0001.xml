naval SITUATION.General Review.DURING operations in the Central Mediterranean German dive bombersmade a determined attack on the fleet, causing serious damage.Shipping losses are below the average and minelaying by enemy aircraft hasbeen concentrated for the most part in the Liverpool area.Home Waters.2. Units of the Home Fleet have continued to provide strong cover forconvoys. Acting on indications by D.F. on the 10th that 3 enemy units mightbe at sea in the North Atlantic, a force of battle cruisers and cruisers fromScapa carried out a sweep to the westward but sighted nothing.H.M.S. A dventure, north-east of Anglesey, sustained structural damage froma mine.which exploded beneath her, and H.M. minesweeper Fitzroy was damaged by a near miss mine and had to be beached at Harwich. H.M. Trawler Oriole was sunk in the British minefield off the Faroes.HM. Rescue Tug Seaman shot down an enemy aircraft which attacked herin the North-Western Approaches, and picked up three of her crew.In an air attack on the trawler base at Yarmouth on the 9th H.M. M/STrawler Peken was damaged.During a heavy air attack on Portsmouth on the night the 10th/11th damage was caused to H.M. Dockyard, R.N. Barracks, H.M.S. Vernon, the R.N. Hospital,Haslar, and the oil fuel depot. Six M.T.B.&apos;s under construction at Vosper&apos;s Yardwere completely destroyed by fire and numerous small auxiliaries under construc-tion were also destroyed.North Atlantic.3. H.M. Ocean Boarding Vessel Mar on brought the French s.s. Cantal(3,178 tons) with a cargo of foodstuffs into Gibraltar under armed guard, havingintercepted her 350 miles to the westward of Casablanca.Mediterranean.4. A convoy of 4 fast M.T. ships, carrying urgent equipment and supplies for Malta and Greece, was successfully passed through the Mediterranean. this operation led to a number of encounters with enemy ships and aircraft. Thepassage through the Western basin, during which the convoy was escorted byH.M.S. Bonaventure and 4 destroyers and covered by HM. Ships Renown, Malaya,Ark Royal and Sheffield, was uneventful apart from an unsuccessful air attackwhen approaching the Sicilian channel, during which two enemy aircraft were shot down by a Fulmar. Five Swordfish aircraft were flown off for Malta from.M.S. Ark Royal during the passage eastward.5. On the 10th January H.M. Ships Southampton and Gloucester took overthe convoy in the Sicilian channel. They reported having cut a number of mines in the vicinity of Pantellaria on their westward passage. When returning withthe convoy they engaged two enemy destroyers sighted south of Pantellaria and sunk one of them. Shortly afterwards H.M. Destroyer Gallant was mined ortorpedoed and had her bows blown off with the loss of 65 killed or missing and15 wounded. She was taken in tow by H.M. Destroyer Mohawk and arrived at malta early on the 11th.6. While the above operations were in progress the main forces of theMediterranean Fleet, consisting of H.M. Ships War spite and Valiant with H.M.S.Illustrious and 7 destroyers, were operating in support in the Eastern Basin and covering the passage from Alexandria to Malta of a convoy which was escorted by H.M. Ships Perth, Orion, York and A jaoc. On the 10th January the Fleet was attacked several times by various types of aircraft. The first attack was bytorpedo bombers on the Battle Fleet, in which torpedoes missed after avoidingaction had been taken.   The second, which occurred at about 1235, was carried
out by 25 or more Ju 87 and 88 dive-bombers which attacked with great determina-tion and skill, thus confirming the arrival in the Mediterranean of units of theGerman Air Force. In this attack 1I.M.S Illustrious was severely damaged as aresult of^6-direct.,bomb hits and several near misses, which caused fires and disabledher steering gear. HeTTcagualties were 83 killed, 60 seriously and 40 slightlywounded, including several officers. II.M.S. Warspiie also sustained slight damage from a near miss. During this attack one Fulmar and one Swordfish were shot down, their crews being saved, and two enemy aircraft were shot down by gunfire.At 1330 an unsuccessful attack was made on Illustrious by high levelbombers and between 1600 and 1700 a second dive-bombing attack by about30 aircraft was made on her and the Battle Fleet in which another hit was believed to have been made on Illustrious, and H.M.S. Valiant had one killed and 3 wounded from near misses. During this attack Fulmars from Illustrious,which had refuelled at Malta, shot down 6 or 7 Ju 87 or 88&apos;s and damagedseveral others. Heavy bombs of about 1,000 lb. were used in all these attacks.Illustrious, covered by the Battle Fleet, arrived at Malta at about 2100 after a final, but unsuccessful, attack had been made oh her by torpedo bombers outsidethe entrance to Grand Harbour. Eleven of her Swordfish and 5 Fulmars were destroyed by fire. -t-   - &quot; -     -        &quot;&quot;X.7. The M.T. convoy, after being joined by two other merchant vessels and h.M. A/A Cruiser Calcutta from Malta, continued eastward. A surprise attack by 12 dive-bombers was made on ELM. Ships Gloucester and Southampton180 miles to the south-eastward of Malta at 3 p.m. on the 11th January while they were proceeding to rejoin the Battle Fleet. H.M.S. Gloucester was hit by anunexploded bomb on the director tower, which killed 9 and wounded 14. H.M.S.Southampton was hit by 3 bombs, causing a large fire which defied control, and she had to be abandoned and sunk at 1900. Her casualties were 80 killed ormissing (including about 27 officers) and 100 wounded.8. A signal from Vice-Admiral, Malta, received at 8 p.m. on the 16th reportsvery heavy raids on the dockyard. H.M.S. Illustrious was hit aft without serious damage, H.M.A.S. Perth was near missed, and the M.T. ship s.s. Essex, whichhad arrived on the 11th, after being detached from the M.T. convoy, was severely damaged.9. H.M. Submarine Pandora reported that she sank two Italian supplyships off Sardinia during the forenoon of the 9th January.East Africa,,10. On the 8th January H.M.S. Furious disembarked aircraft reinforce-ments for the Middle East at Takoradi. 9 Fulmars and 12 Hurricanes landedsuccessfully.  One Hurricane was slightly damaged.South Atlantic.11. The French s.s. Mendoza (6,199 tons), which sailed from Montevideo onthe night of the 12th January, was intercepted by H.M. Armed Merchant CruiserAsturias about 60 miles east of Montevideo. s.s. Mendoza evaded boarding byanchoring inside territorial waters. Asturias is remaining in sight outside territorial waters. An aircraft from H.M.S. Newcastle landed at Punta del Este(Uruguay) early on the 15th January, due to lack of fuel. The crew of 3 havebeen detained by the port authorities pending result of representations by:HM. Minister.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. During the week three attacks have been carried out on U-Boats, all ofwhich were in the Freetown area. Two were made by H.M.S. Mil ford and theother by a Walrus aircraft, but in none of these was there any conclusive result.r-.       [22126] b
Enemy Intelligence.German.13. A photographic air reconnaissance was carried out over Kiel on the9th January. The pocket-battleship lutzow and the old battleships Schlesienand Schleswig-Holstein were alongside, and the cruiser Emden was in dry dock.The floating docks were empty and the battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenauwere not visible, but the whole of the harbour was not covered by the photographs.The new battleship Tirpitz was in Wilhelmshaven on the 8th/9th January, andthe Hipper class cruiser at Brest on the morning of the 16th January.Italian.14. Air reconnaissances of Naval ports in southern Italy and Sicily showed that the two battleships present at Naples on the 9th January had left on thefollowing day. It seems likely that they have gone Northwards to either Speziaor Genoa. Cruisers were seen at Naples and Messina and destroyers at Trapaniand Palermo. Four cruisers, three destroyers and E-boats were seen off Marsalaon the 10th January.V-Boats.15. It is probable that two or three Italian and four or five german-boats have operated in the North-Western Approaches during the period under review, but there has been comparatively little evidence of them and theposition has been at times obscure. In the area off the north-west coast of africa there have been one or two Germans, and in the earlier part of the periodperhaps two Italians, but one of these may have returned.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.Note. The following figures give the losses which have been reported during,the period the 9th to Wth January. They should not be confused withthe figures shown for the last week in the diagrams of shipping lossesattached at the back of the Resume, which show the actual losses for eachcomplete week since the outbreak of war, and are only made up to mid-,night of Sunday-Monday of the week immediately preceding thaicovered by this Resume. Later figures are not included in the diagrams,as they are likely to be unreliable, owing to delayed notifications and uncertainty regarding the result of recent attacks.16. Fifteen ships and two small craft, a total of 54,666 tons, have beenreported lost by enemy action; of these, all but three ships (7,290 tons) were british.  Four of these ships were sunk during the period under review.Six ships (24,346 tons) were sunk by U-boats, two off the West African coast and the remainder in the Nortb-Western Approaches. Five ships and one steamtrawler (20,722 tons) were sunk by mines. Three ships and one steam trawler(8,805 tons) were sunk by aircraft, and one ship (793 tons) by unknown enemy action.Eight ships, of which six are British, are reported damaged. Details ofships sunk and damaged are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During the week ended noon Wednesday, 15th January, 667 ships,including 104 allied and 18 neutral, were convoyed, of which two were lost by enemy action. One battleship, one A/A cruiser, 9 armed merchant cruisers, 35destroyers and 37 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty.Imports to Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the11th January totalled 469,521 tons, compared with 636,082 tons during the. weekbefore, and an average of 729,530 tons for the previous ten weeks. Oil imports,in nine bankers, were 85,284 tons, compared with 115,862 tons in twelve tankers
during the week ending the 4th January. Mineral imports were 140,208 tons, ofwhich 97,223 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. The corresponding figures for the previous week were 143,658 tons and 100,550 tons. Timber imports were 47,706 tons and cereals 100,094 tons, ten ships being fully laden with grain.Other food imports were 57,201 tons, of which 21,600 tons were sugar andmolasses, 8,438 tons tea, 4,781 tons refrigerated and tinned meats and 2,699 tonseggs. There were 216,549 cases (about 7,000 tons) of dates, and 663 tons oftinned and dried fruits. Imports of manufactured goods included 2,100 tons of machine tools.British Minelaying.18. H.M.S. Adventure laid 340 mines in the St. George&apos;s Channel on the11th January and again on the 14th January. H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 320 mines in the East Coast Barrier on the 13th January. Minelaying by aircraft has been continued by both Bomber and Coastal Commands in the Western Baltic off theNorth-West German Coast and the French Channel and Atlantic Coasts.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.European Waters.19. The main activities of enemy minelaying aircraft have been off thewest and south-west coasts, particularly over Liverpool Bay, which was raidedfour nights running. Enemy aircraft were operating over the Thames Estuaryand off the Huniber on the night of the 9th/10th January.There have been seven mining casualties in Home Waters during the week,three of the ships having been sunk. Four of the casualties have occurred in the bristol Channel, probably by delayed-action mines laid during the previous week.On the 12th January S.A. Gear, type A, exploded 14 acoustic mines in just over four hours while sweeping the Thames and Medway approaches. The sameGear has detonated two other miners during the week. SA. Gear, type C, hasdetonated 3 acoustic mines during the week. H.M.S. Valorous put up oneacoustic mine in the Thames Estuary.Twelve magnetic mines have been exploded by LL Sweep, including threeby Baby LL.   The LL total is now 624.One mine and two obstructors were found in the Dover minefield on the14th January.The mine totals, including mines swept in Foreign Waters, are acoustic 139,contact 794, magnetic 856.Foreign Waters.20. Information has been received that minesweeping operations in the BassStrait, Australia, accounted for 21 mines, ten of which have been reportedpreviously. Other minesweeping operations have been carried out off the coastbetween Sydney arid Newcastle, and in the approaches to Adelaide, where twomines were accounted for.  This Latter field is being left unswept for the present!Enemy Merchant Shipping.21.   The Fortuna,  2,700 tons, arrived at  Bilbao from Gijon on the13th January loaded with iron ore, and was expected to sail for France the next day.  The Spezia, 1,825 tons, and the Bellona, 1,297 tons, both left Valencia for.Marseilles on the 10th January.   The two last are said to have had their hullspainted grey, their funnels black, and their names obliterated.Enemy Aircraft Casualties;.  :By Armed Merchantmen.22. During the months July to December 1940 inclusive 14 aircraft were certainly and 6 probably destroyed, and 42 were damaged by 3-inch, 12-pdr. orLewis guns carried by merchant vessels.
By Naval A aircraft. ., ,From the beginning of the war to the 31st December, 1940, 52 aircraft were certainly and 10 probably destroyed, and 49 were damaged by naval aircraft.-    &apos;     - MILITARY SITUATION.Italy. rT&quot;rv&apos;    &apos; &quot; &apos;23. There is still no reliable evidence of the presence in Italy of organizedunits of the German Army.Balkan States.Roumania     &apos; .&quot;24. The total of German divisions in Roumania is now believed to bergight,an increase of three in the last three weeks. This total includes at^feastone armoured and two motorised divisions. During the past week there has been no evidence of any further increase, but several reports state that German troops have moved from Western to Eastern Roumania.Bulgaria.25. It is reported that a German survey of road and rail facilities in South-Western Bulgaria has shown that transport difficulties would render impracticableany large-scale attacks on Greece from this direction. German experts are saidto have decided that tanks and mechanized troops would not be able to negotiatethe Kresna and Predel passes, that the Bulgarian roads generally would be unableto carry heavy traffic and that any large-scale transport of German troops would necessitate the employment of the entire Bulgarian rolling-stock.Albania.28. After a lull of some two weeks the Greeks have resumed the offensive inthe south and have captured Kelcyre, as well as a number of villages north-east of that place. The road thence to Berat has been cut and further progress hasbeen made towards Tepelene. A quantity of prisoners and material, includingfour tanks, has been taken.Weather conditions remain extremely difficult and, though a thaw has begun in certain areas, snow continues to fall on the greater part of the front. TheSkumbi and Devoli rivers are reported to be flooding as a result of the partialthaw and, though this will in all probability hinder the Italians rather more thanthe Greeks, it will not simplify the task of supplying the Greek Army along verydifficult and inadequate lines of communication.Italian dissatisfaction with the progress of the campaign is emphasised bythe replacement of General Soddu by General Cavallero, who also holds theappointment of Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces. General Cavaliero is believed to be Fascist in sympathy, but is a &quot; dark horse &quot; compared with the tworeputable officers, Marshal Badoglio and General Soddu, who preceded him. this move is probably a sop to the leaders of the Fascist Party who have criticised theconduct of the campaign, but it remains to be seen whether any improvement willensue if, as is suspected, General Cavallero is to be the mouthpiece for ordersissued from Italy.Bulgaria.27. During the first week of January the country was deep in mud after a heavy thaw; since then frost has set in again in the north. Although largenumbers of reservists have been dismissed others are still being called up, andthe total number of men under arms is now estimated at about 220,000. Thesecontinual call-ups and dismissals are creating great discontent.
Africa.Libya. . .  .28. Although a detailed check has not taken place, it appears that, duringthe operations against Bardia, 2,041 officers and 42,827 other ranks have been captured or killed. The following equipment has also either been taken or destroyed : 368 medium and field guns, 26. heavy A A. guns, 68 light A.A. guns,117 light tanks, 13 medium tanks and 708 M.T. vehicles.The garrison of Tobruk, believed to comprise one Italian division and certainancillary troops, including 6,000 frontier guards, is still invested by our forces.There is also reason to believe that it has been reinforced by the two Blackshirtgenerals who retired from Bardia. If Tobruk falls, it is difficult to forecastwhere the Italians will make their next stand. Two infantry divisions are believed to be located between Derna and Benghazi; these may be used to cover the approaches to Benghazi, where a part of Italian G.H.Q. is now believed to be.There are no indications up to the present time of the arrival of reinforcements in Libya.Sudan.29.   Our patrols continue active.East Africa.30. On the 9th January a force consisting of armoured cars, one infantry battalion and a field battery entered Buna unopposed. They have subsequentlyreturned to Wajir without incident.Far East.Thai-Indo-China Hostilities.31. The hostilities between Thailand and Indo-China have until recently-been confined to air action and minor frontier clashes.On the 8th January however the Thais advanced across the Indo-Chinafrontier into Cambodia, occupied the border town of Poipet, and continued their advance for thirty miles along the Sisophon road. They are also reported to have advanced on Mongkol Borei, the rail-head of the line from Phon Penh, 130 miles west of Saigon. Further south the Thais claim to have reached Peilin, a townjust within the Cambodian frontier.Reconnaissance raids by French troops in the Aranya Prades and Chantaburisectors have also been reported.A number of defence measures have been taken by Thailand. An orderrestricting the liberty of movement of French nationals was issued on the7th January, martial law was proclaimed in twenty-four districts in North-Eastand East Thailand on the 8th January and, since the 10th January, a generalblack-out has been enforced in Bangkok.Indo-China Japanese Penetration.32. French troops have reoccupied the frontier posts between Tongking, thenorthern province of Indo-China, and China.The Japanese troops, who number about 6,000 to 8,000, are now confined toHanoi, Haiphong and the aerodromes in their vicinity, and only a small Japanesecommission remains at Langson.AIR SITUATION.General Review.33. Operations by the Home Commands were again restricted by unfavour-able weather conditions, but were on a higher scale than in the previous week.An outstanding feature of the week&apos;s operations was a daylight attack onlanding grounds in French territory by a formation of bomber aircraft escorted by a large force of fighters. The principal night attacks have been made against the naval port of Wilhelmshaven, the oil plant at Gelsenkirchen and a&quot;Hipper&quot; class cruiser at Brest.   On two occasions targets in Italy were[22126] c
attacked from this country, and objectives in Sicily have been attacked from malta. Fighter Command flew a number of offensive patrols both by day and by night over the Straits and Northern France.Enemy attacks on this country were on the same scale as in the previousweek. The heaviest was on the night of the 9th/10th January, when 300 aircraft were employed. It was widespread and did not appear to be aimed at anyparticular objective.In Libya, our aircraft have made several heavy attacks on Tobruk andBenghasi and on the aerodromes at Benina and Berka.Operational aircraft casualties and extracts from recent Raid AssessmentReports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied Territory,34. Bomber Command flew 45 day and 425 night sorties during this period,an increase on the previous week of 162 sorties. Weather conditions caused alloperations to be cancelled on one night, and on two nights the number ofsorties were severely restricted. Although the weather improved on other nights,enabling our aircraft to operate, conditions were by no means favourable forbombing operations.35. There have been a number of attacks on oil targets. On the night ofthe 9th/10th January one hundred and thirty-five aircraft were despatched toattack the Nordstern Oil refinery at Gelsenkirchen. Many aircraft were,however, unable to locate their primary target under the prevailing weather conditions and were forced to attack alternative targets. Ground haze overGelsenkirchen precluded accurate observation of results, but many bursts amongstfactory buildings and on a railway in the vicinity were reported. Numerousfires and explosions were also observed.36. On the night of the 9th/10th January twenty-two aircraft bombed the oil storage tanks at Rotterdam and a number of large fires were seen. Again,on the night of the 12th/ 13th January aircraft attacked the oil refineries atRegensburg, but results were difficult to observe.37. On two nights the dockyard and naval base at Wilhelmshaven weresubjected to heavy attacks. On the first occasion, although bombs were dropped inthe target area, results, were generally unobserved. The attack on the second nightwas, however, very successful, numerous and -very large fires resulting. Thewhole of an area covering approximately l-g miles by 800 yards was reported ablazing mass. Other large fires and heavy explosions were observed in thevicinity.38. Determined efforts have been made during the week to inflict further damage on the &quot; Hipper &quot; class cruiser lying in dry dock at Brest. On five nights a total of 85 aircraft were despatched with this target as their principalobjective, and, over this period, four direct hits on the cruiser are reported. Inaddition, considerable damage was done to warehouses and buildings in the dock area and widespread fires were observed.39. Lorient was attacked on two successive nights by Beauforts of coastal command. On each occasion bombs and land mines were dropped. Bursts were observed on a large block of buildings, and one mine was seen to burst near thePower Station or Ordnance Works, which caused an enormous explosion.A pillar of black smoke up to a height of 10,000 feet was reported. A secondmine burst close to two vessels and others are estimated to have fallen withinthe target area. On other nights attacks on a lighter scale were made on Lorient,Havre, Dunkirk, Boulogne, Calais, Ostend, Flushing and Rotterdam.40. On the night of the 14th/15th six Hudsons were despatched toattack air bases at Stavanger. The aerodromes at Mandel and Forus were successfully attacked, and two hits were obtained on a 5,000-ton merchant vesselin Stavanger Roads. Bombs were also dropped near a railway bridge in thevicinity of Egersund.41. During the week a number of attacks on shipping, barges, harbours and troops have been made by the cloud-flying Blenheims. In addition, a formationof Blenheims, with a large fighter escort, carried out a day attack on the landing
grounds at Guines. Very litle opposition was encountered, and during theoperation our fighters shot down two enemy fighters and probably a third.42. A number of offensive sweeps by our fighters have been carried out overthe Channel and Northern France, and shipping and troop concentrations havebeen attacked. Night patrols over Northern France by aircraft of fighter command have been continued, and during these operations one Ju. 88 was destroyed.Italy.43. On the night of the 11th/12th January seven Wellingtons operating from this country located and bombed the Royal Arsenal at Turin; all bombs fellin the target area causing large fires and heavy explosions. One other aircraft attacked a ball-bearing factory at Turin with similar results.44. On the night of the 12th/13th, five Wellingtons, also operating fromthis country, attacked the oil refineries at Venice. One large building was seen to collapse and another was hit by a heavy bomb. The last aircraft reported the target area to be a mass of flames. During these operations a large liner in thevicinity of Venice and hangars and workshops at Padua were machine-gunned.45. On the night of the 9th ./10th January seven Wellingtons, operating from Malta, attacked the harbour and marshalling yards at Messina. A Navaloil storage depot was bombed, together with the marshalling yards and oil tanksnearby.  Bombs also straddled cruisers and ships in the harbour.46. With the object of destroying German aircraft operating from air bases in Sicily against our naval forces, ten Wellingtons were despatched from malta to attack the aerodrome at Catania. The attacks appear to have been most successful. Photographic reconnaissance disclosed that thirty or forty aircraft on the ground were burned out or severely damaged. In addition, one hangarwas destroyed, another severely damaged, and administrative buildings hit.47. On the night of the 10th/11th January, six Swordfish of the Fleet air arm attacked shipping and the docks at Palermo, hits being obtained on the jettyand warehouses, and large fires started.United Kingdom.48. There was no appreciable change in the scale of operations of theGerman Air Force during the period under review as compared with the previousweek, except for an increase in minelaying.49. Reconnaissance was again the chief daylight activity of the enemy. Afew single aircraft flew inland and dropped bombs on various parts of the country.Our fighters were hampered by bad visibility.50. Enemy long-range bombers were active on six nights of the week. the heaviest attack was made on the night of the 9th/10th January by about300 aircraft. It was widespread and was neither heavy nor sustained on anyparticular objective. The Portsmouth area was attacked on the night of the10th/Uth, the London area on the 11th/12th and on the following night, and theEast Midlands on the 15th/16th, the number of aircraft employed on these nightsranging between 120 and 150. Plymouth received a short and concentratedattack by about 30 aircraft on the night of the 13th/14th.51. Visibility was bad during the week, but three enemy aircraft were destroyed by our fighters and five by A.A. fire.52. Fighter Command flew 483 patrols, involving 1,295 sorties, by day and227 patrols, involving 276 sorties, by night. These totals are slightly higher thanthose of last week.Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying.53. Aircraft of the Coastal Command flew 162 patrols and reconnaissancesinvolving 331 sorties. In addition 109 convoy escorts were provided involving279 sorties.
54. Mines were laid by aircraft . of Bomber and Coastal Commandsoff Kiel, Dieppe, Lorient, Brest, St. Nazaire, in the Jade, Weser and Ems rivers,Hubert Gat, iFohrmaaMi Channel and Elbe Estuary.55. There have been a number of attacks on enemy shipping. On the9th January a Hudson on patrol off Egersund Fjord bombed a 5,000 ton merchant vessel, but results could not be observed. A second Hudson on the same patrolbombed a railway bridge over a river near Egersund, as a result of which onespan appeared to collapse.56. On the 12th January two Blenheims on patrol off Bergen attacked a4,000 ton merchant vessel which is believed to have been set on fire. On the same day two Beauforts off Holland attacked a 4,600 ton merchant vessel securingone hit on the stern with a 250 lb. bomb.57. About 160 enemy aircraft were employed in minelaying, and numerousreconnaissances were carried out over a very wide area.Greece and Albania.58. Bad weather has again greatly restricted our operations. Only tworaids were carried out, both under very difficult conditions.59. An Italian column retreating from Kelcyre to Berat was bombed onthe 10th January, and Berat was bombed on the 13th where, it is believed, a road bridge was hit. Several reconnaissances of the south-eastern section of theIonian sea were flown by our Sunderlands.60. On the 11th January two enemy fighters made a machine-gun attack onthe aerodrome at Heraklion (Crete) and damaged one of our aircraft.Egypt and Libya.61. Constant and heavy pressure has been maintained on Tobruk, whilstaerodromes likely to assist in the defence of the position have been madeuntenable by the attacks of our aircraft. Reports of abandoned aircraft and landing grounds indicate that the enemy has withdrawn his air forces to theBenghasi area.62. Benghasi was heavily attacked five times. Hits were registered on fivelarge ships in the harbour, on the mole and on Government buildings. the neighbouring aerodromes of Benina and Berka were also successfully attacked, and much damage was caused to aerodrome buildings, hangars and aircraft on theground.  At Benina, at least twelve enemy aircraft were set on fire.63. On the 8th January there was a very successful bombing attack on a convoy of motor transport near Jerabub by Blenheims, followed by a machine-gunattack by Hurricanes, as a result of which the convoy was abandoned.64. Our fighters were also very active. They maintained offensive patrolsin the Tobruk and other areas, and destroyed several enemy aircraft both in theair and on the ground.65. Several reconnaissances of the Libyan coast were flown by ourSunderlands.66. Enemy aircraft activity was slight. An attack was made on our troopsin the Tobruk area, but little damage was caused.Gibraltar.67. The usual anti-submarine patrols and reconnaissances were flown,including one reconnaissance of Casablanca.Malta.68. During the week reconnaissances were made of several harbours and aerodromes in Italy and Sicily and of portions of the Ionian Sea.
69. Enemy aircraft approached the Island on several occasion during theweek. On the 9th January, six out of twelve fighters, which flew over the Island,attacked Luqa aerodrome, and damaged three Wellingtons. Six Hurricanes on patrol shot down four of the attacking aircraft and a fifth was destroyed by A.A.fire.  The attack on the dockyard on the 16th is reported in the Naval Situation.Sudan and Bast Africa.70. Normal activity has been maintained in this area during the week.Massawa, Asmara and Mai Adaga in Eritrea were heavily attacked. AtMassawa, searchlights which have only recently been installed, hampered the pilots&apos; estimation of the damage. At Asmara and Mai Adaga fires were started in the workshops. Assab and Diredawa were also attacked and hits were registered on stores, warehouses and military buildings.71. On the Sudan-Abyssinian frontier, several attacks were made on troop concentrations, and on the 9th January six of our aircraft dive-bombed the landing ground at Javello and destroyed two enemy aircraft. Reconnaissanceswere flown over Abyssinia, and propaganda leaflets were dropped in manydistricts.72. In Italian Somaliland several enemy troop positions were bombed and machine-gunned.In addition, several reconnaissances were flown in this area and fighter escortsprovided for convoys.Air Intelligence.Italy.73. Reports of the move of units of the German Air Force to Sicily havebeen confirmed by recent attacks on our naval forces in the Central Mediterranean.The present strength of the force is estimated to be about 60 to 80 aircraft andcomprises long-range bombers and dive-bombers. The ultimate strength of theGerman Contingent may amount to 250-300 aircraft.Roumania.74. German Air Force penetration into Roumania has been proceeding forsome months and recently a number of flying units have arrived. Their strengthnow amounts to 250-300 aircraft of all types, the majority being single enginedfighters and Army co-operation aircraft. The projected strength may reach atotal of 600 aircraft of all types.75. The German occupation is taking on a permanent or long-termappearance and the scale of preparations indicates that they will be suffiently advanced for major operations to start before the beginning of March.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.76.

-APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Results of Raids.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week :  Germany.Bremen. Photographs taken by P.R.U. show that considerable damage hasbeen caused, and that the damage is almost wholly confined to the industrial partsof the city. Numerous warehouses, sheds and buildings have been gutted or destroyed. Damage is particularly noticeable in the neighbourhood of the AtlasWerke (where two bays have been gutted) and of the Framche Werke (wherefactory buildings and nearby railway buildings have been hit). The Focke WulfFlugzeugwerke appear to be slightly damaged.The wreckage of a neutral steamer of 782 tons sunk in the harbour is to beblown up as it causes an obstruction to navigation.Mannheim. An informant states that in the month of December there werefour direct hitson the goods station and nine on the main station. In fifteen differentplaces direct hits destroyed considerable portions of the railway track, and it was estimated that complete repairs would take three weeks. Particular difficulty was caused by a direct hit at the western end of the railway bridge betweenMannheim and Ludwigshaven, where the goods station was also partially destroyed by fire. The informant was told that 248 properties were destroyed and seven factories were compelled to stop work entirely. A shipping yard wasburnt out and 160 persons were killed.Berlin. In the month of November bombs which fell in the Dorotheen Strasseblew out the greater part of the windows of the Ministry of Interior. One bombhit a watermain and thirty people in a cellar were drowned.Dusseldorf. In addition to Eheinmetall (previously reported) MannesmannWerke and a steel works in the Oberkassel area have been seriously damaged.General. New and more strict blackout regulations have been issued. Allhospitals, streets, shipping and any part of a building that has a direct connectionwith the outside must be illuminated only with blue lamps which cannot be stronger than 25 watts. All torches must only have blue lights. Illuminatedsigns have been cancelled entirely save in the case of hotels, which can have a smallline giving the name, and cinemas, who can advertise the name of the film being shown up till a quarter of an hour before the last performance begins.Occupied Belgium.Photographs taken by P.R.TJ. show damage to the goods depot to the north of Stuiveuberg Station, and that there is now no roof on three bays of a largewarehouse north of the America Docks. Since the 2nd January, five bays of awarehouse north-west of the dry docks at the end of the Bassin du Kattendijkhave been demolished, and there is the skeleton of a three-bay building seen tothe east of this basin.Norway.In early December the Norwegian steamer Tore Jarl of 1,500 tons arrivedat Haugesund badly damaged as a result of aerial attack.
Holland.Several persons have written of the severe damage caused to the sugar beetfactory at Puttershoek.Mining.In November a Danish and a German vessel in convoy were mined in theOslo Fjord.
