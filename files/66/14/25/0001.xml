The Report summarises the statistical and other available material required for decisions on future policy on this question.2. The Report shows that during this winter the Germans must drawheavily upon their remaining stocks, and that they will not be able to replenishthese stocks during the summer months of 1941 unless there is some major change,to their advantage, in the strategical situation which will give them command of sea routes. While there appears to be no probability of an immediate dearth of oil products in Germany itself, something like an oil famine is now setting in inGerman-controlled Europe.3.   We invite attention to the following points : (a) There is now a shortage of gas and diesel oils.(b) It is probable that the product of the synthetic hydrogenation plant isnow essential to provide a base for aviation fuel. The total output ofthese plants is estimated to be capable of providing about a year&apos;supply of aviation fuel as measured by recent rates of consumption.(c) Only about 7 per cent, of the total weight of bombs dropped on targets in Germany has so far been devoted to oil targets.(d) The time factor is of the greatest importance.    The Germans are now engaged in completing new synthetic plants and in reorganisingtransport of oil from Roumania with a view to greatly increasing their supplies. It is only by early action that we can obtain full value forour effort.4.   Our recommendations are as follows: (a) Air attacks should be concentrated mainly on sources of syntheticproduction of oil in Germany, and especially (i) the Fischer-Tropsch plants, which are an all-important factor in the production of gas and diesel oils;(ii) the   hydrogenation   plants,   on   which,   apart   from   stocks,Germany will depend for high-grade octane aviation spirit.[22082]* P.O.G. (40) 63.
(b) When bombing aircraft of sufficient range are available, air attacksshould be directed against Danubian oil ports as soon as river traffic is resumed after the frost.(c) Every possible opportunity should be taken to destroy oil supplies in italy, her Colonies and Albania operations by air being supportedif practicable, by naval bombardment.[We attach as an appendix a copy of a recent telegram from our oil Attache at Bucharest commenting on the oil situation in Italy.](d) With a view to supplementing the operations of the Royal Air Forceless orthodox methods for effecting any of the above projects should be pursued to the utmost practicable extent.(e) The Ministry of Economic Warfare should continue to make arrange-ments, wherever possible, to reduce the supply of oil, and especiallylubricating oil, from Russia to the Axis Powers.On behalf of the Committee :(Signed) HANKEY, Cli airman.Great George Street, S.W. 1.January 2, 1941.Copy of a Telegram dated December 20, 1940, from Sir R. Hoare (Bucharest).(No. 1800.   Immediate.)BERTHOUD reports as follows :-2. Supplies of oil to Italy in November amounted again to only 30,000 tons,in spite of all efforts to increase this quantity. For December this must dropto 25,000 tons and probably not exceed 20,000 tons whilst the Danube is frozen.3. A member of the Italian Petroleum Delegation in Roumania recentlyinformed one of their chief oil suppliers that Italy was running short of gas oil,fuel oil and aviation spirit, and that to continue the war they must import80,000 to 90,000 tons per month from Roumania.4. That Italy is hard pressed for oil is proved by the fact that they arearranging to send fleets of road tank cars to Roumania to fetch supplies. It seemssignificant that Germans are doing nothing to help Italy. On the contrary theyare claiming the only available additional Roumanian tank cars for their own requirements.5. I suggest that the Italian oil deficiency position could be greatlyaggravated by bombing (a) Livorno, where Roumanian crude oil is hydrogenated to aviation spirit;and(b) Simplon Line, along which virtually all supplies now pass.6.

NOTE BY THE CHAIRMAN.I submit this report with the following comments:1. Many highly-qualified experts have contributed to this study, which is,however, partly based on intelligent guessing. It is, therefore, not a statisticalforecast but an &apos;&apos; appreciation &apos;&apos; made to help those who have to take decisions.2. The work has been done in a cautious spirit and generally, when in doubt,the Committee have taken a figure favourable to Germany. So it is well to realise that if the estimates were, for example, only 10 per cent, too favourable to the axis, their actual position on oil would be one of imminent danger.3. The broad background of the report is that Western Europe, dominated by Germany, is trying to manage on a good deal less than half the supplies ofliquid fuel which were consumed in peacetime. The total stocks are now certainlyfalling, probably rapidly until the Spring, afterwards much more slowly, even then not reaching the theoretical breaking-point in the Autumn.4.   Within the complex: (a) Germany makes and takes the lion&apos;s share: deals with the seriousremaining deficiency by ruthless rationing, on which basis she seems atpresent fairly well off in aviation and motor spirit, but hard upfor gas and diesel oil.(b) Italy is rapidly using up the large stocks with which she entered the war.The loss of Albanian crude oil would be an extra blow.(c) vichy France muddled away a good part of the stocks that were leftafter surrender and is now desperately short.(d) Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium are all very short and con-sumption is severely restricted. For example, the Norwegian fishingfleets, which supply Germany with fish and fish oils, are operating on amuch restricted level awing to shortage of gas and fuel oil.5. There is no evidence that the military effort of Germany or Italy has been restricted by oil shortage, but the Committee point out that the greatly increased number of German aerodromes is likely to immobilise a large part of the reserves of aviation spirit and that, apart from any stocks in hand, Germany in future&quot; will be almost completely dependent for high-grade aviation spirit on the outputof the hydrogenation plants.&quot; I need not emphasise the crucial importance of thispoint.6. I know the difficulties, but it is worth repeating that the only way to get a quick death clinch on the whole enemy oil position is both to destroy the synthetic plants and to interrupt Roumanian supplies.7. My own view is that the Axis oil position is sufficiently important andsufficiently weak to justify a heavy effort against the strategic points. Meanwhile,Germany is not idle. She is working ceaselessly to increase her synthetic pro-duction, to organise a great increase in transport from Roumania, and to develop the widespread use of substitute fuels. In a vast supply question like this, the time factor in the development of the opposing trends may prove decisive.
FIFTH REPORT.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.Our last report on the German oil position was submitted in July. In this5th Report an effort has been made by careful study of the available facts and byinferences therefrom to appraise subsequent developments and to form a view as tothe trend immediately ahead. Having regard to all the uncertainties of thesituation, we feel that it would be unsafe to attempt a precise forecast for so long aperiod as a year and we recommend that a further study should be made inFebruary. For convenience, we summarise below the main conclusions to bedrawn from this report.1. On the assumptions adopted in the Report it is estimated that the freestocks, excluding the amount of oil locked up in the distribution system, under control of the Axis are likely to fall substantially during the Winter and may atthe end of March not exceed     to If million tons.2. During the Spring and Summer, on the same assumptions and providedthat other conditions remain as at present, the draft on stocks is likely to beslowed down in consequence of greatly increased imports from Roumania.3. While supplies of lubricating oils appear in general to be still sufficient for Axis requirements, there is evidence of serious deficiency of gas and diesel oils.4. To produce the maximum effect on the Axis oil position, attacks on german synthetic oil plants should be as continuous as circumstances allow, until it becomes evident that the plant has been put out of action.5. The destruction of Nitrogen plants, such as those at Leuna and Oppau,has a special value in view of their potentialities for the output of substitute fuels.6. Attacks on German refineries, except those on the Danube, are regardedas of less importance owing to the fact that refinery capacity is far in excess of theamount of crude oil available.7. All possible action should be taken against Roumanian oil supplies.Damage to Roumanian refineries and loading facilities would greatly increase thedifficulties of transportation.8. In view of the greater weakness of the Italian position which might obligeGermany to supply oil to her partner, attacks should be pressed, as far as circum-stances permit, against Italian oil resources and, in particular, the plants at Bariand Leghorn.9. British control of the Eastern Mediterranean remains of paramount importance, because only by the sea route can the balance of the Roumanianexport surplus be conveyed to the Axis Powers until such time as they have fullyorganised the river and rail transport system.10. As regards the likelihood of an attempt to secure control over Iraq andthe Middle-Eastern oilfields, it is suggested that a move of this kind would, inpresent circumstances, be dictated rather by the desire to consolidate the economy of a continental Europe under German control than by the urgent necessity of increased supplies for immediate consumption.
Part I. General Position.THE fourth report of the Committee, dated the 14th July, was based uponthe assumption that German)^ would obtain control of the Roumanian oilfields,and that, having done so, she would have a total available annual supply of some9-7 million tons of liquid fuel with which to meet the minimum war requirementsof herself and Italy, estimated at 8-5 million tons, and the needs of German-controlled or occupied Europe, which in 1938 consumed some 13 million tons.* Itwas further estimated that stocks in Germany, Italy and controlled and occupied territories amounted to some 1\ million tons, of which not much more than5 million tons could be regarded as freely available, since about 2-1 million tons would be permanently locked up in the distribution network.These basic figures have been re-examined in the light of the events of thepast three months and of further detailed study that has been made of thedifferent possible methods of producing synthetic oils and motor spirit inGermany. Some allowance can now be made for the effect of air bombardmentin reducing supplies. Further information about German plans for deliveries from Roumania has become available : there is some further information on Russian supplies and about stocks in occupied and controlled countries.2. In the present report the estimates of resources and consumption are shown for two separate periods, October 1940-March 1941 and April-September1941. The object of this form is to emphasise the difference between theconditions of the two periods, the earlier, in which the drain on stocks will beat the maximum, and the later, during which the Axis Powers may benefit fromthe reorganisation of the transport system from Roumania, which is dealt within Appendix II. The more important factors in the preparation of these estimates are as follows : (1) The examination of the results of the air bombardment of the Germansynthetic plants, on the basis of the period up to the 4th October,during which time the plants were subjected to only 6-7 per cent.(539 tons) of the total weight of aerial attack on all targets, indicates that the output of the plants attacked was reduced by 15 per cent.Later investigations, covering the period up to the end of November,more than maintain this estimate. On the assumption that further attacks are successful in sustaining a 15 per cent, rate of reductionover all plants during the period under review, the total output willhave been reduced from 3 to 2^ million tons (see details inAppendix III).(2) Detailed investigations recently concluded indicate that the output fromtar oils produced by the low-temperature carbonisation process and theuse of substitute fuels, such as bottled and producer gas, are on a considerably higher scale than was assumed in earlier reports.Account must also be taken of the capacity of nitrogen plants, whichare surplus to present needs, to produce methanol capable of use as adiluent of motor spirit. While in earlier reports the use of certainsubstitute fuels was allowed for in calculating the probable civilconsumption of Germany in wartime, we consider that a clearer viewof the position would be obtained if these fuels are shown both on theproduction and consumption sides of the account (see Appendix I).(3) Imports from Russia must be regarded as problematic for reasons both political and technical, but, in view of relatively high deliveries duringthe period June - to August, and with due allowance for winterconditions, we are disposed to estimate 700,000 tons for the whole period compared with 350,000 tons during the first year of war. Thebasis on which imports from Roumania have been revised is given inAppendix II.(4) Some opinions received from American oil companies within the last few days suggest that the initial estimate of 3 million tons for stocks in Germany at the outbreak of war, which we adopted in earlier* Under present circumstances it is considered that Greece should be excluded. sweden and Finland are in a special position in so far as they can draw directly upon Russia for some part of their supplies.   Allowance is made for this in the calculations in paragraph 3.
reports, may have been too low. Although our own estimate was made after studying all available evidence regarding German storage accomodation, imports and local production in the years immediately preceding the war, a careful reconsideration is now in progress.Meanwhile, we allow for a possible variation in the stock position.(5) Consumption by Germany and Italy, on the basis of 3 months&apos; estimates,from July to September 1940, is calculated at an annual rate of10 million tons, of which a detailed account is givenAppendix IV.in.

If it were assumed that the initial stock figures were, say, 500,000 tons higher thanallowed for (vide paragraph 2 (4) above), the estimates of stocks given in C should be raisedaccordingly, always assuming our estimates, which have been framed on a conservative basisfavourable to the enemy, prove to be substantially correct.
4. The above calculations make no allowance for intensification of damageby air attack, but assume that reduction of output on the recent scale achieved upto the end of November is maintained. They assume a high degree of success inro-organisation and deliveries from Roumania and a doubling of supplies fromorEussia. They also allow a rate of consumption in occupied and dominatedcountries so low as to limit seriously their agricultural and industrial output and to create such social conditions as may make them an economic, if not amilitary, liability to Germany. Even after making these estimations, which arefavourable to the enemy, the table shows that by the early spring of 1941 currentoutgoings in Axis-controlled Europe will have substantially exceeded currentsupplies, and that there will be a decline in stocks of the order of 2 million tons.It will not be possible to make good during the favourable supply months of the summer, the drain on stocks likely to occur during the present winter, and afurther, though moderate, reduction of stocks is to be expected.There are, however, about 1 - 4 million tons of stocks in Roumania, of whichperhaps 1 million tons are readily available, and while these cannot be transportedto Germany at a higher rate than allowed for above, they are available for operations in the Black Sea, South-East Europe and Eastern Mediterranean. Ifthe Axis were to succeed in opening the sea-route from the mouth of the Danubeto Adriatic and Mediterranean ports, this would enable these stocks and the excess of current production, up to a combined total of about 2 million tons inthe six months, to be transported to Italy and other Mediterranean ports accessible to the enemy. Hence the vital importance of British control of the eastern mediterranean.5. It is clear from the above figures that the present statistical positionwithin the Axis is not by any means satisfactory enough to relieve them fromserious concern for the future. Particularly, there must be an ever present fear that, even on the existing relatively inactive scale of land operations, a moreconcentrated air attack on their synthetic plants, and a failure for any reasonof their channels of supply from Roumania and Russia, might cause a criticaldeterioration in their position.Part II. Particular Products.An examination of Axis supplies of particular products indicates that, incertain cases, the outlook may cause them even more anxiety.(a) Gas and Diesel Oil.There is definite evidence that special efforts have been made recently tosecure priority for deliveries of gas and diesel oils for both Germany and italy from Russia and Roumania. Reports on the inadequacy of supplies of these oilsto Germany have reached us from adjacent territories. Large supplies in theaggregate are consumed by heavy road vehicles, stationary diesel engines,submarine and light naval craft and also by tanks and other military vehicles.We are also informed that considerable quantities are now being used by commerceraiders, though the bulk of these might come from other sources. This oil can also be hydrogenated to give a higher yield of high-grade aviation spirit than canbe obtained from coal, but this would seem unlikely so long as supplies are short.Estimates made by the Petroleum Department and by the Ministry of economic warfare independently suggest that the Germans consumed during thefirst year of the war gas and diesel oil in excess of current supplies to an amountof . 50,000 tons. Stocks in September 1939, plus loot acquired in France, cannotnave greatly exceeded this figure. All the evidence points, therefore, to a seriouspresent shortage. A recent German deal to exchange 14,000 tons of motor spirittor a similar quantity of gas oil from Sweden had to be cancelled because of damage done by the R.A.F. to the hvclrogenation rjlant at Politz and the storagetanks at Stettin.;. Further economies in the use of this oil can only be effected with greatdiiuculty and, as supplies delivered into Germany and North-Eastern Europecannot be rapidly increased, either industry or the armed forces (except those nearKoumania) must go short.The principal sources of gas and diesel oil are Roumania, the Fischer-Tropschplants in Germany and German crude oil.   The Fischer-Tropsch plants are of
special importance since they produce a high-grade oil, which, even when mixedwith inferior tar oils, produces a satisfactory fuel for diesel engines.(b) Aviation Spirit.At recent rates of consumption Germany and Italy need at least 1\ million tons of aviation spirit a year. The maximum amount Roumania could supply infinished form is 150,000 tons per annum; while Russia was supplying at the rateof 7,000 tons per month during the summer of 1940.It had been assumed in earlier reports that Germany had built up such large stocks of petrol capable of being raised to aviation grade that no serious shortage was likely to develop. The change in the strategic situation, which makes it necessary for Germany to maintain aerodromes stretching from thePyrenees to Petsamo and from Constanza to Cherbourg, must have immobiliseda large part of her. stocks, because stocks must now be held in reserve in anincreased number of widely scattered aerodromes. The effect of this, added to the attacks on the hydrogenation plants, is making supplies of aviation fuel muchmore vulnerable than hitherto.Apart from any stocks which still remain, Germany will be almost completely dependent for high-grade octane spirit upon the output of herhydrogenation plants. However, the proportion of hydrogenation spirit inrecently captured samples tends to show that this position has not yet beenreached.The results of the analyses are, as yet, by no means conclusive and we have asked Sir Harold Hartley, with such colleagues as he may select, to assist in theinterpretation of the available evidence. These enquiries will cover the analysis of captured samples of other petroleum products (e.g., motor spirit, diesel andlubricating oil) and also questions regarding the use of substitute fuels by theenemy and any technical problems generally which arise out of our examinationof the German oil position. We anticipate that the work of this body will greatlyassist us in assessing vulnerable points in the enemy&apos;s supply position.(c) Motor Spirit.As regards both motor spirit and lubricants (except those of special quality),the position is probably not so uncomfortable as in the case of gas oil and aviation spirit. Motor Spirit can be produced by the Fischer-Tropsch process and be imported in relatively large quantities from Roumania. It can be diluted bythe addition of alconol, benzol and methanol.Great economies in the use of motor spirit have been effected by rationing and other methods, and the use of producer gas and other substitutes has been substantially increased (see Appendix I).(d) Lubricants.While there is undoubtedly some shortage of special grades, a seriousdeficiency of lubricants in general does not yet appear to have developed. as envisaged in our 2nd Report, there is evidence of extensive recourse to regenera-tion of used oil and of successful utilisation of specially treated vegetable oils.There are, however, limits to the process of regeneration, while any extensiverecourse to vegetable oils can only be made at the expense of edible and industrialoils. Thus the position, while not at present critical, may become increasingly difficult. Italian stocks appear to be low and may require, within the next sixmonths, to be supplemented by German supplies. A denial of Russian suppliesof lubricating oil to the Axis Powers would bring about an important reductionin the quantities available.(e) Fuel Oil.A large proportion of the Italian and French stocks and of currentRoumanian output consists of fuel oil which is in excess of current Italian andGerman requirements for oil of this type. Much of the surplus could be profitablycracked to produce lighter fuels, or, alternatively, treated in hydrogenation plants.In our calculations we have taken fuel oil at its full value in tonnage, but, if itshould be submitted to these processes, a considerable wastage would be incurred.
Synthetic and Substitute Fuels.(i) Low Temperature Carbonisation.It was previously assumed that practically the whole of the tar produced inGermany by the process of Low Temperature Carbonisation was used as rawmaterial for hydrogenation, and that it was, therefore, unnecessary to allow fora separate production of oil from this source. A detailed study of the LowTemperature Carbonisation Industry, however, shows that of the total about800,000 tons of tar are likely to be surplus to the requirements of the hydrogena-tion plants during the coming year, and will probably be treated by a distillationprocess. This might yield between 50,000 and 80,000 tons of motor spirit,between 160,000 and 250,000 tons of diesel oil, and between 300,000 tons and400,000 tons of fuel oil according to the process adopted. The total supplies of oil from this source may, therefore, be put at 600,000 tons, though, since thegreater part of the output consists of fuel oil, the value of this source of supplyunder present conditions is less than would appear from the total figure above.(ii) Possible Conversion of Nitrogen Plants to Oil Production.Surplus capacity at German synthetic ammonia plants of the Ffaber-Boschtype might comparatively readily be utilised to achieve a substantial increase in supplies of methanol, amounting to between 1 - 3 and 1 - 5 million tons per annum.This methanol might be utilised either in admixture with petrol or benzole, or itcould be used as a motor fuel by itself. The latter alternative would, however,require certain alterations to the engine and carburettor, and the vehicles so con-verted would be unable to make use of standard mixtures. The large scale use ofmethanol alone would, therefore, require the setting up of a comparativelyelaborate distribution network for this fuel. Since no evidence of this has beenobtained, it is considered unlikely that methanol is being used alone on any appreciable scale. It may be added that, owing to the low calorific value ofmethanol, the available supplies would be equivalent to only about 600,000 tons of petrol per annum.It would, however, be possible to use without difficulty methanol-petrol blendscontaining up to 20 per cent, methanol. On the basis of the estimated motor spiritconsumption in Germany alone, this would permit the absorption of some400,000 tons of methanol during the year from the 1st October. If greatlyincreased supplies of petrol are obtained frOm Roumania, it would, of course, bepossible to increase the quantity of methanol used. In this event, however,estimates of supply and consumption show that there would be no really serious shortage of motor spirit, so that the incentive to increased use of methanol wouldbe reduced.Bearing this in mind and also the low calorific value of methanol, it is con-sidered that the consumption of methanol as motor spirit during the coming year&apos;s  unlikely to exceed 400,000 tons.In the previous reports allowance was made for the consumption of 70,000tons of methanol per annum (the quantity actually consumed in 1938).It is possible that synthetic ammonia plants might have been converted to theproduction of oil from tar, creosote or coal. The conversion of the plant is simplerif tar or creosote, rather than coal, is used as the raw material, although even whentar or creosote is used, considerable additions are necessary, representing roughlyone-third of the total cost of the hydrogenation unit.(iii) Substitute Fuels.A good deal of publicity has been given recently to the development ofsubstitute fuels, both in Germany and the occupied territories. Apart from theuse ot benzole and alcohol in admixture with petrol, the principal substitute fuels(1) Compressed gases, mainly propane and butane obtained from petroleumrefineries and synthetic &quot;plants.(2) Coal gas.(3) Producer gas.
After allowing for other uses of butane and propane (principally theproduction of iso-octane and of synthetic rubber) it has been estimated that thequantity available in Germany for use as motor fuel is probably about 300,000 tons per annum at the current rate of output of Hydrogenation and Fischer-Tropschplants. In a recent broadcast, General von Schell stated that there were, at thebeginning of October, 60,000 vehicles driven by bottled gas, which may include some vehicles operating on coal gas. This figure compares with only 2,000 at theoutbreak of war, when the total number of lorries in Germany was 400,000.There is reason to believe that the whole of the available supplies of butane andpropane are now being utilised, since a rationing system for these fuels was introduced on the 1st October, 1940. It may therefore be concluded that furtherconversion can only be effected if it is possible to increase the production capacityof synthetic oil plants       whole.Theoretically the possibilities of use of town gas, either in cylinders or inballoons, are limited only by the amount of gas available for the purpose, which inGermany might be considerable. In practice, however, the usefulness of theballoon type of container is limited by the small range of action allowed about20 miles in most cases. In the case of compressed gas, it is necessary to providespecial steel bottles capable of withstanding high pressure of the order of3,000 lbs. per square inch. It is therefore probable that, up to the present, littletown gas has been used as motor fuel in Germany, and that effort has been directed mainly to the use of liquefied propane and butane and small quantitiesof natural gas obtained from the Polish and Hungarian oil-fields.In the long run producer gas undoubtedly presents the greatest potentialitiesboth in Germany and the occupied territories. A wide range of fuel cannormally be used, e.g., anthracite, coke, charcoal or wood, though, in Germany,most anthracite has been found unsuitable owing to its high tar content, whileexperiments with German coke were also not very successful. Owing to lack ofthe necessary plant for charcoal production, it seems that development is likely tobe concentrated mainly on wood, which suffers from the disadvantage that, if any reasonable quantity of fuel is to be carried, this occupies very considerable spaceand thus materially reduces the load-carrying capacity. The principal difficultyin developing the use of producers is that the conversion is comparatively costly in this country about  100 per vehicle. The conversion of any considerablenumber of vehicles, therefore, requires a substantial industrial effort.At the 31st July, 1938, there were in Germany 1,547 vehicles driven byproducer gas and 647 vehicles driven by compressed coal gas. Recently it was announced by General von Schell, that there were 14,000 vehicles driven byproducer gas in Germany.Attempts are also being made to convert stationary diesel engines in Germanyto run on producer gas. It is estimated that, in 1938, these engines consumedsome \ million tons of diesel oil. Confirmation of the fact that diesel oil is one ofthe most serious shortages in Germany is provided by the fact that priority isbeing given to the conversion of diesel engines and diesel-engined lorries toproducer gas over petrol-driven lorries.In the occupied territories also considerable effort is being devoted to thedevelopment of gas producers. In most of these countries the development of asynthetic oil industry is impossible owing to lack of coal, while there is for thesame reason no surplus coal gas available. The development of producers istherefore the only course open to them. In France it is considered that 150,000vehicles might eventually be converted to producer gas operation, but it is unlikelythat this could be effected within three or four years. The Government are,however, aiming at the conversion of 50,000 vehicles before the end of 1940.It is clearly difficult to estimate the rate at which conversion to producer gasoperation can be effected, but it is considered that the total saving of motor spiritthrough the use of butane and propane, town gas and producer gas may be put at 600,000 tons during the coming year, of which 250,000 tons may be attributed to the first six months and 350,000 tons to the second six months.
The Vienna Conference.THE importance of the transport problem to the Axis Powers was recognised by the appointment of a Conference on the 16th to 18th July, betweenthe authorities of the railway systems of Germany, Italy, Roumania and othercountries concerned. The main object was probably to devise the best means of arranging to transport a given quantity of oil rather than to consider the quantityof oil likely to be required by Germany or its availability. The programmearranged covers the export of 568,000 tons of oil per month to Germany and Italy,compared with the recent export surplus of about 300,000 tons per month.Mr. Berthoud, Oil Attache at the Legation in Bucharest, has commented on theprogramme as follows : (1) Even with reduction in domestic consumption and increase of produc-tion in Roumania, it is not likely that the export surplus would exceed 450,000 tons a month, from which the needs of the Balkans,Switzerland, &amp;c, would also have to be met so far as Germany was prepared to allow.(2) The carriage of the proposed volume of oil traffic by rail would, involve1some 17,000 tank cars. Out of Roumania&apos;s fleet, about 4,400 mightbe available for export traffic, while Germany and Italy had promised5,000 cars; but, even so, there would be a shortage of over 7,000 cars,and it is considered unlikely that the full number would be madeavailable.(3) The carriage of over 350,&apos;000 tons a month by the Danube would involve&apos;550 barges, or more than double the number now on service on the danube. It is considered that the programme is likely to proveextremely difficult to achieve.(4) The conclusion is that the programme is the result of a close study of themaximum which the railways could stand without regard to the actualavailability of oil, engines, tank cars and barges.An examination of the capacity of the railway lines involved shows that theultimate attainment of the programme in -some favourable months is not impossible on this score. Its attainment would, however, almost certainly, involvethe displacement of other important traffic. It is quite clear, however, that, quite apart from the availability of the oil, the full programme could not be attainedfor a very considerable time, since it involves the provision of a very large numberof additional tank wagons and barges.In attempting to forecast probable Roumanian deliveries during the second year of war, the experience of the last few months must be taken into account.For the three months August to October the average monthly deliveries toGermany and Italy were 210,000 tons.Bearing in mind that the Danube may be closed by ice for, say, two months,we consider that deliveries to the Axis Powers are unlikely materially to exceed million tons during the six months from the 1st October, an amount only slightly less than the total deliveries to Germany in the first year of war.Deliveries during the second six months will depend upon the degree ofsuccess achieved by Germany in reorganising transport and making provision of necessary tank wagons and barges. A tentative estimate of 1\ million tons isregarded as reasonable.
Assessment of Damage to Synthetic Plants.ALL possible means are being explored of assessing the probable effect on german synthetic oil production as a whole of bombing attacks to date. some very tentative and preliminary conclusions are now beginning to emerge as aresult of examination of accumulated data and experience gained from the effects of German raids on this country. Reduction in output as a result of raids maybe caused in two ways : (a) loss of output due to shut-downs caused by the imminence of attacks.(b) loss of output due to physical destruction of plant.As regards (a), it is possible that the Germans are more careless of the safety of their staff in air-raids than is usual in this country. On the other hand, itmust be remembered that failure to take certain precautions in shutting down the process will greatly increase the severity of the damage to plant, should direct hits be secured. For this reason, the Germans probably do shut down to someextent when a raid becomes imminent and the process is such that a considerableinterval must elapse before the plant again gets on to full-scale output. To theextent that the German plants do not shut down in raids, the maintenance of output from this cause is likely to be counterbalanced or outweighed by thegreater severity of damage when hits occur.As regards (b). the extent of physical damage on the average can be judgedonly with reference to certain imperfectly tested assumptions regarding the weight of explosives required to destroy particular types of targets, havingregard to the probable degree of accuracy in bomb-aiming on targets of differentsizes from various heights. Further assumptions have to be introduced regardingthe probable rate of repair of such physical damage as has been judged to havebeen inflicted. The conclusions reached on the basis of these purely theoreticalassumptions can then be varied in the case of particular plants according to thenature of the circumstantial evidence i.e,, cases where the evidence seems toshow that attacks have been more successful than the average, it will be legitimateto expect results more optimistic than the theoretical average expectation, and vice versa.By this still very tentative method the preliminary conclusion has beenreached that the reduction in German synthetic oil output since attacks began inJune is not likely on a conservative basis to have been less than 15 per cent, ofthe normal monthly production of those plants attacked. This would be equivalent to the reduction by about 30,000 tons of total synthetic oil suppliesestimated to be running at the rate of about 220,000 tons a month. Furtherinvestigations, covering the period to the end of November, indicate that these results have been more than maintained.In certain industries, experience in this country has shown that the fear ofair attack is in itself sufficient to bring about a material reduction of output.It seems, however, improbable that this factor applies in the case of synthetic oil production owing to the nature of the process. Such reduction of output maybe considerable in the case of skilled machine tenders, but in the case of synthetic oil the process is continuous and largely automatic, and should, therefore, belittle affected by the morale of the employees.Lest this result may be thought unduly modest in relation to the effortexpended, the following factors may be called to mind :  (i) The greater part of the German synthetic oil industry did not come within range of attack until the middle of August,(ii) In most oases, the weight of attack on individual oil targets has notapproached the estimated level required for an advanced state of physical destruction especially in view of the fact that the neteffectiveness of the attacks has been reduced by the long period over which they have been drawn out, giving time to repair the effects of earlier damage.
(iii) Owing to the diversion of effort against special priority targets fromtime to time, the total tonnage of attack applied to oil targets hasbeen relatively modest.(iv) The conclusions regarding the degree of damage inflicted on Germanplants and the effect of it will certainly be subject to revision as the assumptions on which they are based are tested in the light of furtherexperience.As regards (iii), the relative bombing effort expended on the various types oftarget is shown by the following figures supplied by the Air Ministry for thetonnage of bombs dropped between the outbreak of war and the 4th October.The figures relate to attacks carried out by Bomber Command only : Weight of attack on various classes of Target from outbreak of War to october 4.Glass of Target.Oil targets............       .......      1,196Refineries ....Synthetic plants ....StocksAircraft industry (including aluminiumand aerodromes) ....       ....       ....      1,846AerodromesFactories   ....AluminiumCommunications ....       ....       ....       ....      2,931Marshalling yardsCanalsMiscellaneous (columns of troops, &amp;c.)Invasion ports     ....       ....       ....       ....      1,310Power      ....................        163Chemicals and explosives        ....       ....        103Naval   armaments    (including   ship-building yards and ships in harbour) 270Land armaments ....       ....       ....       .... 35Miscellaneous industrial targets        ....        160Total................      8,014Tonnage of bombs.4535392031,202511133610552,266Per cent,of totaleffort.15371621-23-40-42-0100-0The estimated reduction of 15 per cent, in the output of synthetic plantshas, therefore, been achieved with the expenditure of only 539 tons of bombs, or6-7 per cent, of the total effort expended on industrial targets, communications and invasion ports.

The minimumconsumption of Germany and Italy, when engaged in war with the BritishEmpire, was estimated in the fourth report of the Committee on the GermanOil Position at 8 - 5 million tons, of which approximately 6 - 3 million tons was attributable to Germany and 2-2 million tons to Italy.German consumption during the past three months is believed to have been at a higher rate than this. Estimates prepared by the Service Departments putconsumption by the German Army at approximately 135,000 tons per month,by the Navy at 70,000 tons per month, and the Air Force at about 90,000 tons per month.On the assumption that these average rates are maintained throughout theyear, the comparison with the estimates of the 4th Report is as follows (inthousands of tons) : 4th Report. Revised.Army      ...............      1,100 1,650Navy       ...............         500 850Air Force         ............      1,200 1,1002,800 3,600Civil and Industry      ..........      3,500 3,9006,300 7,500The revised service figures show an increase of 800,000 tons per annum comparedwith the previous estimate, which may be ascribed mainly to -(i) Increase in the German Army, especially mechanised units,(ii) Troop movements from West to East and the withdrawal of front linetroops from France and the entry of the army of occupation,(iii) Increased naval activity, including commerce raiding, resulting mainly from the great extension of the coast lines under German control.As regards civil consumption, it was considered, in arriving at the estimates of 8-5 million tons, that, as the result of further restrictions on the use ofpetroleum products and the increasing supply of substitute fuels, the estimate for civil consumption in the second year of war might be reduced from 3-5 to3-0 million tons. In fact, however, aerial bombardment of the German railwayshas greatly increased the pressure on road transport and it is thought that civilEstimated Supplies and Consumption, July-September 1940.1. Germany.During the three months, July to September 1940, total supplies toGermany are estimated to have been approximately 650,000 tons per month
consumption during the three months July to September was certainly not lessthan the rate of million tons per annum. Moreover, since producer gas andother substitute fuels are now being allowed for in framing the estimate ofGerman supplies, they must also be included in consumption, with the result thatthis estimate is raised to 3-9 million tons per annum. This estimate takes no account of increased consumption by merchant shipping, barges, &amp;c, in connectionwith invasion preparations.The minimum German consumption during the period July to Septembermay therefore be put at the rate of 1\ million tons per annum (approximately equal to supplies over this period).In calculating German stocks at the 1st October, 1940, it is also necessaryto take into account losses resulting from air attacks on refineries and storageinstallations and consumption in connection with invasion preparations (includinglosses from air attack on the invasion ports and barge concentrations). taking all these factors into account, it is considered that German stocks were probablyreduced during the three months, July to September, by about 100,000 tons,but as those stocks may have received at least an equal accretion from methanolsupplies not accounted for, no change is deemed necessary in the figure of1-6 million tons.-2. Italy.Assuming (a) That refineries have been working according to production licences issued for 1940,(b) That wartime consumption in Italy has been only slightly higher thanthe rate already adopted,it is estimated that, between the 1st June and the 1st October, Italian stocks were reduced from 3 million to 2-2 million tons. Crude stocks, which amountedto 650,000 tons on the 1st June, are believed to have been virtually exhausted bythe 1st October. Italian consumption is estimated to be about 2\ million tonsa year, of which about 1 - 2 millions is service and 1 - 3 millions civil consumption,including bunkers.3. Occupied and Controlled Territories.A great deal of evidence has been received that an acute shortage of allpetroleum products had developed by the end of September in the occupied territories and in unoccupied France. This shortage appears to be most acutein unoccupied France and there is evidence that distribution in this territoryhas been extremely inefficient and that consumption, immediately after thearmistice, was running at a very high rate having regard to the level of availablestocks.Less information is available regarding occupied France, but reports havebeen received that petrol is practically unobtainable by the general public, andthat oil transport in Paris is virtually at a standstill.&apos; The fishing industry, inspite of receiving preferential treatment, has also been seriously affected by shortage of fuel.It appears that considerable quantities of oil were destroyed in the R.A.F.raids on French installations. Putting this destruction at about 50,000 tons atleast, and consumption at 160,000 tons per month (approximately one-third ofthe previous rate) stocks in France on the 1st October may be estimated at-4 million tons, neglecting any quantities which may have been removed toGermany.In Denmark several increases in the price of petrol have been made withthe object of reducing consumption, which was reported at the end of July tobe running at about 20 per cent, of normal. Preferential treatment appears tohave been given to the fishing industry, the ration for September being 2,000 tonsagainst a normal consumption of 3,700 tons per month. It was, however, statedthat a further substantial reduction would be made as from the 1st November.Germany has undertaken to supply Denmark with 1,200 tons of motor spirit(50 per cent, alcohol) per month. It appears that the Danes have been using these supplies to eke out their own small stocks of motor spirit, and, since the1st September, only petrol containing 20 per cent, alcohol has been on sale.
In Norway also preferential treatment has been accorded to the fishing industry but stocks of solar oil were reported in the middle of September to besufficient to last only to the end of the month. The number of private cars in use is said to have been reduced to about 5 per cent, of normal, and the numberof buses and trucks to 75 per cent., but the latter have been able to obtain only30 per cent, of their normal motor spirit supplies. It has also been reportedthat, owing to petrol shortage, German troops and officials in Norway are not allowed to use cars. , .  TT .    &apos;The latest reports suggest that stocks in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland,Belgium, Hungary, Bulgaria and Yuoslavia (apart from any stocks which mayhave been transferred by Germany to the occupied territories) did not exceed800,000 tons on the 1st October.Total stocks available in Germany, Italy and German controlled anddominated Europe, excluding Roumania, are. therefore, estimated as follows(neglecting transfers from France and Italy to Germany which have almost certainly taken place on a considerable scale) : Estimated Stocks, October 1, 1940.Million tons.1-62-21-40-65-8Less: Minimum Distribution reserve ...      ... 2-5Freely available stocks ...       ...       ...      ... 3-3GermanyItaly      ...............FranceControlled and dominated countries ...
