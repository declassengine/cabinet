1 1 printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1941. ^ I siSECRET. Copy No.   *oW.P. (41) 11.January 19, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AMD KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ATLANTIC FERRY ORGANISATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.THE number of pilots and trained personnel at present available to the atlantic Ferry Organisation is utterly inadequate to secure the flight-delivery of American aircraft.The problem is immediate.It calls for a decision by the Cabinet to strip civilian flying organisations of trained pilots, crews and maintenance personnel for the reinforcement of the atlantic Ferry; and further, to direct the Air Ministry to make up the balanceof our requirements from its resources of personnel here and in Canada.I therefore ask my colleagues to authorise (1) the transfer to the Atlantic Ferry organisation of the pilots now employed by the British Overseas Airways Corporation, withtheir maintenance staff;(2) the transfer to this Ministry, for Atlantic Ferry work, of pilots,crews and engineers now engaged on internal air services in theUnited Kingdom;(3) the augmenting of the inadequate pilot strength with crews nowcompleting their training in the Flying Schools in Canada;(4) the transfer to this Ministry of the five consolidated B 24 aircraftnow allocated to a trans-Atlantic service. These aircraft arerequired by us to carry pilots and other personnel westwardsover the Atlantic. If required for bombing Berlin, M.A.P. will,of course, relinquish these airplanes forthwith and rely uponthe Boeing Clippers 314 instead.B.Ministry of Aircraft Production,January 19, 1941.Note. British Overseas Airways Corporation personnel not suited forAtlantic Ferry will be diverted to the Ferry Pool in Great Britain, thusreleasing available pilots from that Organisation.[22133]
