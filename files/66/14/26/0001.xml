(41) 13)January 2, 1941Copy No.  28TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that-special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 70)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon December 26th, 1940, to12 noon January 2nd,1941[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff. I
naval SITUATION.General Review.THERE have been no outstanding events at sea during the week.Shipping losses have been below the average, though the tonnage reportedsunk is high due to delayed news of sinkings by enemy raiders.Although a large number of German and Italian U-Boats have been reported,operating, losses from this cause have been small, but casualties have been heavierdue to enemy minelaying.Northern Waters.2. Units of the Home Fleet have been operating in Northern Watersreinforcing the Northern patrol and covering incoming convoys.Home Waters.3. Anti-E-Boat operations off the East coast were carried out by motorboats co-operating with flare-dropping aircraft on nights of the 26th, 28th and29th December; and anti-minelaying patrols by M.T.B&apos;s. and Trawlers off Doveron nights of the 27th and 28th.&quot; Destroyers carried out a patrol to the West ofBrest on night of the 27th /28th. In none of these operations were enemy forcesencountered.4. On the 28th H.M. Destroyer Valorous and H.M. Corvette Crocus were damaged in collisions off Sheerness and the Mersey respectively. On the1st January H.M. Destroyer Venemous was damaged by mine and towed toLiverpool, and the R.F.A. Attendant (1,016 tons) was mined and sunk in the thames Estuary.H.M. Destroyers Salisbury and Newport (ex U.S.S.) have arrived in home waters from Canada.5. Slight damage was caused at the R.N. Victualling Yard, Deptford, by air attacks on the 27th and 29th, but in the attack on Plymouth on the 28thNaval damage was negligible.Southampton was bombed by single aircraft on the afternoon of the 28th.H.M. Destroyers Opportune and Norseman under construction were hit, the latter being severely damaged.   The Tug Canute was also sunk.North Atlantic.6. All the ships in the convoy, which scattered on the 25th December dueto the presence of an enemy raider, have been located and are now proceeding totheir destinations. Two ships, the S.S. Empire Trooper and the S.S. Arabistan,were damaged, but were able to proceed under their own steam, the former callingat the Azores to make good temporary repairs.H.M. Submarine Trident attacked the Panamanian S.S. Bonita off PontaDelgada, Azores. Three torpedoes were fired and missed; one of them explodedon the beach and damaged a house.Mediterranean.7. Light forces of the Mediterranean Fleet have been working off the Libyancoast in co-operation with the Army, and also covering a convoy from Egypt tothe Piraeus.H.M. Monitor Terror and other shipping at Sollum were unsuccessfullybombed by Italian aircraft on the 26th.Two Italian Battleships and shipping at Naples were bombed by the R.A.F.on night of 29th/ 30th. The Littorio, in dock at Taranto, was bombed on night of30th/31st, when bombs were seen to burst all round the ship.On the 30th H.M. Trawler Bandolero sank as a result of a collision with .M. Australian Destroyer Waterhen in the Gulf of Sollum. The Waterhenreturned to Alexandria with damaged bows.There was some movement of French ships past Gibraltar, including thepassage eastward of a floating dock towed by three tugs. On the 31st December an
eastbound convoy escorted by an armed trawler was intercepted by our destroyersoff Cape Tres Forcas, outside Spanish territorial waters. The escort, which pro-tested, was allowed to proceed and the convoy was sent in to Gibraltar. Somecasualties were accidentally caused in one French ship which at first resisted theboarding party.Pacific Ocean.8. The Island of Nauru, where shipping was attacked on the 8th December,was heavily shelled On the 26th December by an enemy raider sailing underJapanese name and markings. The raider, S.S. Nanye Marti, signalled that the shore station was not to use wireless, and. then, after hoisting the Nazi flag,shelled at close range the loading jetty, oil storage cisterns and phosphatebuildings. Private houses were not fired on. There was no loss of life, but greatmaterial damage was done.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. During the week under review six attacks on U-boats were made, threeby aircraft, two by A/S vessels in the North-Western Approaches and one by anA/S vessel off Malta.  None of these attacks are known to be successful.On the 18th December PI.M. Submarine Tuna attacked and probably damaged a U-boat near Bordeaux.On the 22nd December S.S. Sarastone (2,473 tons) claimed to have obtainedtwo hits on a U-boat when 300 miles S.W. of Cape Finisterre.Enemy Intelligence.German.10. Air reconnaissance of German Naval ports carried out on the1st January showed the battleship Tirpitz still in the Bauhafen at Wilhelmshavenand the eight-inch cruiser Seydlitz at Bremen.Italian.11. Air reconnaissance of Taranto on the 26th December showed that theCavour class battleship had not moved but the Littorio was in dock elaboratelyprotected against air attack. In addition, there were four cruisers and ninedestroyers present. At Brindisi on the same day there were four cruisers, six destroyers, and five submarines. At Naples on the 30th December there were two battleships, three 8-inch cruisers, two 6-inch cruisers, and six destroyers,and on the 1st January there were three cruisers and four destroyers at Tripoli.U-boats.12. There have been two to three Italian and one to two German U-boats in the Azores-North Africa area throughout the week. One of these was operatingoff Sierra Leone.In the North-Western Approaches there have been four to five Germans and four Italians.French Intelligence.13. It has been reported both from Washington and Lisbon that the Vichy-French submarine Sfacc was torpedoed and sunk on the 20th December in aposition about 15 miles off Cape Juby (North Africa). Sfaa was on the surfaceacting as escort to the Fleet Oiler Rhone, of 2,780 tons. The oiler was also sunk.All of the crew of the Rhone and four from the Sfaoc were picked up. It hasbeen confirmed that no British submarine was in this area at the time of the incident.A fairly reliable report from Lisbon states that French warships at casablanca have now been given orders to keep clear of British men-of-war and avoid any action that might be considered provocative.[22083] ^ B
Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.Note.-The following figures give the losses which have been reported during the period the 2Qth December, 1940, to the 1st January, 1941.They should not be confused with the figures shown for the last week in the diagrams of shipping losses attadhed at the back of the Resumd,which show the actual losses for each complete week since the outbreak,of war, and are only made up to midnight of Sunday-Monday of theweek immediately preceding that covered by this Resume. Later figures are not included in the diagrams as they are likely to be unreliable,owing to delayed notifications and uncertainty regarding the result ofrecent attacks.14. Details of shipping losses are given in Appendix I. Fifteen ships and4 small craft are reported lost by enemy action, totalling 81,861 tons, of which48,488 tons was British. Only five of these ships were sunk during the week under review.Four ships (32,638 tons) were sunk by U-boat, 2 of these west of Freetownand 2 in the North-Western Approaches; 4 ships and 4 small craft (9,564 tons)by mine; 7 ships (39,659 tons) by surface craft, one by E-boat on the East coast and the remainder by raider in the Pacific. Sixteen British and 3 Allied ships are reported damaged, 8 of these by enemy aircraft.Enemy aircraft unsuccessfully attacked east coast convoys on three daysduring the period, and a Channel convoy on a fourth. A Channel convoy was alsoheavily shelled off Dover by shore batteries, the only result being slight damage to two of the escorting trawlers. A homeward-bound convoy from Sierra Leonewas attacked by a single aircraft on the 29th, when 50 miles off the North coast of Ireland. The s.s. Trevarrack was hit and set on fire, but was towed intoharbour.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. During the week ended noon Wednesday, the 1st January, 1941, 744ships, including 140 Allied and 11 Neutral, were convoyed, of which two were lost by enemy action. Two cruisers, 8 armed merchant cruisers, 37 destroyers, 46sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Since the start of the war 208 ships have been lost in convoy or 1 ship inevery 235, and 165 million gross tons of shipping, with a carrying capacity of250 million tons, have been convoyed, of which 0-6 per cent, or 987,000 grosstons has been lost.Imports into Great Britain brought by ships in convoy during the weekending the 28th December, totalled 627,000 tons, compared with 702,710 tons during the previous seven days, and an average of 772,209 during the last ten weeks. Fourteen tankers brought 138,985 tons of oil of various grades. mineral imports were 166,551 tons, of which 112,844 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron,and iron ore. Timber imports were 81,706 tons, an increase of 8,543 tons. cereal imports were 106,884 tons, eleven ships being fully laden with grain. Other food imports were 96.430 tons, of which 34,996 tons were sugar and molasses and20,916 tons were tinned and refrigerated meat, bacon and hams. Cargoes also: included large consignments of lorries, machine tools and aircraft.British Minelaying.16. During the week H.M.S. Adventure laid 280 mines off Ushant. Mine-laying by aircraft has been rather more extensive and mines have been laid by both Bomber and Coastal Commands in the Western Baltic and the FrenchChannel and Atlantic coasts.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.17. Probably owing to adverse weather conditions, very little minelayingby enemy aircraft has been carried out during the week. On only one night, the27th December, were enemy aircraft reported off Lowestoft and over the thames estuary. Nevertheless, twelve ships have been mined during the week, four ofwhich were sunk. Eight of the casualties occurred in the Liverpool area, two inthe upper Thames Estuary, one off Harwich and one in Penzance Bay.
The Isle of Man packet boat S.S. Victoria, which was mined on the27th December in Liverpool. Bay, probably by an acoustic mine, had put up sevenacoustic mines on her inward and outward runs on the 23rd December. these Catrine is also said to haye detonated four acoustic mines in the same area on the 29th December, one of which damaged the ship.During the week mines have been swept off Harwich, the Thames Estuary,Dover, Falmouth and Liverpool.The mine totals are now : Acoustic 113, Magnetic 838, and Contact 772.Twenty-two mines have been swept up in the minefield to the south-west of malta.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.18. The S.S. Kulmerland 7,363 tons, which is reported to have landedsurvivors on Emirau Island from ships attacked by raiders in the Pacific, was lastlocated in a shipyard at Kobe. She was then said to have been renamed theTesyo Maru, since confirmed, and to have been transferred to the Japanese flag.She is said to be lightly armed and to carry a seaplane. The S.S. AnnelieseEssberger, 5,173 tons, sailed from Kobe on the 29th December. She is reportedto have taken on a large quantity of fuel oil before leaving.Italian.19. The S.S. Olimpia, 6,040 tons, which sent out an S.O.S. on the 6thDecember, is now reported to have been torpedoed at daybreak on that date about40 miles south-west of Durazzo.Raider Activity in the Pacific.20. The information obtained from the prisoners who were landed atEmirau (New Ireland) has added greatly to our knowledge of the raider positionin the Pacific. There would seem to be two raiders at work in this area and twoor more attendant supply ships which may also act as minelayers. The raidersare said to have a base in the Marshall Island, probably at Maloelap Atoll. Thefirst raider sailed to the Pacific via Cape Horn and arrived in June 1940, when she laid mines off Auckland, New Zealand, and captured the S.S. Tropic Sea,which she sent home as a prize. During July she returned to her base, but was again active off the Queensland Coast and in the Tasman Sea in August, when she sank two ships and shot down an R.A.A.F. aircraft. On her return to herbase she was joined by the second raider. During October one ship was sunk nearOcean Island. Early in November both raiders left the base for New Zealandwaters, where they were joined by the Kulmerland and sank two ships.Kidmerland had left Kobe on the 9th October, had probably proceeded to the base and loaded mines and laid them in Australian waters during the early part ofNovember. After Kulmerland and the two raiders had joined forces about the24th November, the three ships proceeded northwards in company to Nauru, wherethey sank five ships on the 7th and 8th December and then returned to the baseto refuel on the 12th December. The prisoners were landed at Emirau fromKtdrnsrland, and the second raider on the 21st December, but it is not clear whether the first raider was present on this occasion. On the 26th December thesecond raider attacked the phosphate installation at Nauru.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.21. For the last two months reports have been received of considerable road and rail reconstruction in Slovakia.The main road, running from Zilina to the frontier of Hungarian Ruthenia,appears to be under reconstruction throughout its entire length, while roadsleading northwards over the Carpathians into Poland have been reinforced andwidened, and certain road bridges strengthened.   The road from Ruzomberok
running south-westwards to the Hungarian frontier has been repaired andwidened.The Slovakian railway system is also said to have been improved, both byconstructing a new line southwards into Hungary and also by the abolition oflevel crossings and the doubling of tracks.The result of these activities will no doubt improve communications hereto-fore inadequate and would facilitate the movement of German troops southwardsfrom southern Poland, and also south-eastwards from the Protectorate throughHungary to Roumania, a necessary preliminary to any possible German campaign in the Balkans.In view of the possibility of a German advance into, or through, Bulgariait is of interest to note that the River Danube on the Bulgarian frontier does notfreeze solid in a normal winter. Blocks of floating ice, however, make it very dangerous for any craft, including ferries, to make use of the river.The Balkan States.22. Severe weather conditions, as well as stubborn Italian resistance,continues to slow up operations in Albania, Nevertheless the Greeks still hold the initiative and are steadily ousting the Italians from their positions. In theCentral Sector they have advanced from 3 to 5 kms., occupying heights and villages during mopping up operations.In the coastal area they have advanced further towards Valona and havetaken heights some 10 kilom. N.W. of Himara. A number of prisoners and somematerial has been captured in this area.Although the Italians have reinforced their garrison in Albania, there is as yet no indication that they are contemplating, or will be able, to make a definitestand against the Greek advance, although the latter has necessarily slowed clown.Bulgaria.23. Though certain military circles are pro-German, the majority of the rank and file of the Army is against any form of military adventure; so muchso, that on at least one occasion disaffection among the troops has amounted to open mutiny. Seven or eight hundred men were involved, and it is likely that therecent large-scale demobilizations have been due as much to difficulties of this nature as to any political reason.Troops on the Turkish frontier are being thinned out and certain divisions are returning to their normal peace stations.Turkey.24. A considerable concentration of troops is reliably reported in theBodrum-Milas area, and it is probable that a new division has been formed here.It will probably be numbered 19th, and will form part of the Mountain Corps,which the Turks have proposed to form in the area opposite the Dodecanese.Africa.Egypt.25.   Bardia remains surrounded by British forces.Sollum has been bombed and shelled on several occasions, but littleinterference with the work of landing supplies has been caused.Patrol activity has taken place in the Jarabub area to the south and our troops occupied a post evacuated by the enemy 20 miles S.W. of Jarabub on the27th December.Prisoners taken during the operations are now estimated at 40,000.The whole of W.S. 4 has now arrived at Suez.   The units in this convoyincluded : 2nd Armoured Division.One Australian brigade group (comprising one infantry brigade, onefield regiment, one A/Tank regiment).One medium regiment, R.A.Two Light A.A. regiments, R.A.One S/L regiment.
Sudan.East Africa.26.   Our patrols continue to be active.West Africa.27. (a) Reinforcement of Freetown.-Th&amp; 161st Brigade Headquarters,2/5 Essex Regiment, Brigade Signal Section and L.A.D. have been despatched to Freetown. With the 1/4 Essex Regiment, Field Company R.E. and FieldAmbulance which are already out there, there will be in Freetown 1 brigade group of 2 Battalions. In addition, approval has been given for the formationof a Royal West African Frontier Force Brigade in Sierra Leone. This will consist of 2 battalions which are at present at Sierra Leone, and 2 which areforming in Nigeria.The expansion of the Royal West African Frontier Force is continuing andfurther reinforcements and ancillary units have been despatched. Approval hasbeen given for the formation of the following Corps : Corps of West African Engineers.West African Signal Corps.West African Army Service Corps:West African Army Medical Corps.West African Army Ordnance Corps.(b) West African Governors&apos; Conference. At a conference of three of theWest African Governors and the G.O.C., West Africa, it was decided that apermanent Governors&apos; Conference Secretariat should be established. Its main object will be the co-ordination of war effort in West Africa.Japan.28. During the last three months there has been an increasingly largenumber of reports on parachute training by Japanese, both in Japan and in occupied China. Whilst the numbers mentioned, about 25,000 in Japan and1,500 elsewhere, may well be exaggerated, there would appear to be little doubtthat intensive training is in fact taking place.AIR SITUATION.General Review.29. Unfavourable wintry weather conditions considerably reduced our operations, but a heavy concentrated attack was made on Bremen.Enemy night attacks on this country were on a reduced scale and on three nights no operations took place. London was attacked twice on a moderate scale,but one attack was successful in raising the most serious fires.Our bombing operations in Greece and Libya have continued at considerableintensity.Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent Raid Assess-ment Reports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied Territory.30. Bomber Command flew 31 day and 328 night sorties during the period and a number of additional attacks were made by Coastal Command aircraft.31. Weather conditions by dav were so unfavourable that on only one day during the period were Bomber Command medium bombers successful direct hits were registered on a factory at Cologne, on an anti-aircraft ship at Flushingand on an administrative building at Haamstede aerodrome. Coastal command aircraft made some good day attacks on aerodromes in Northern France and on railway sidings at Dieppe and Le Treport. During one of these raids a Blenheimshot down a Me. 109. On three days small fighter patrols carried out low flyingattacks on ground targets in Northern France, in the course of which aerodromes,anti-aircraft posts and other military targets were machine-gunned.[22083] e
32. The 1st/2nd January was the only night during which it was possibleto carry out the full bombing programme. On this occasion, out of a total of 154sorties, nearly one hundred bombers concentrated on targets in Bremen which included the shipbuilding yards and naval base, the railway station, the DeutscheVacuum Oil refinery and harbour warehouses. Visibility was excellent as theground was covered with snow, and there is no doubt that the raid was most successful, an enormous fire at the railway station being particularly impressive;all the aircraft returned.33. On two nights heavy attacks, in which Coastal Command aircraftparticipated, were made on the submarine base at Lorient with very good results.The smithery was engulfed in fire and hits were made on the barracks, the wireless and power stations and in the dock area. Two effective attacks were also made on the aircraft assembly aerodrome at Bordeaux. On the night of the1st/2nd January, eleven Coastal Command Blenheims attacked the train ferriesat Flushing; bombs fell in the target area and a very large fire resulted. TheChannel and Atlantic ports and aerodromes in occupied territory were subjected to a series of light attacks.Italy.34. Bad weather prevented operations against Northern Italy, but, as already reported under Naval Situation, attacks were made by Wellingtons from malta against enemy naval units at Naples and Taranto. On the night of the29th/30th December six tons of bombs were dropped in the target area at Naplesand a fire was left burning; further observation was impossible. On the following night an attack with similar results was made by five aircraft on Taranto, and bysingle aircraft on a chemical factory at Cotrone and the docks at Palermo.Leaflets were dropped in the course of these raids.United Kingdom.35. Fighter Command flew 345 patrols, involving 913 sorties, by day, and73 patrols, involving 90 sorties, by night. These totals are only about one-half ofthose flown last week, and correspond to a similar reduction of effort by theGerman Air Force.36. German fighter operations over this country have been negligible, andthe activities of our fighter patrols have been confined by day to the successful pro-tection of Channel and East Coast shipping, and to the interception of bomber-reconnaissance aircraft which have taken advantage of the cloudy conditions.Bombs were dropped in daylight during the week by single aircraft on a fewaerodromes, where no damage was caused, and at Orewe, Southampton and inthe Eastern Counties. Conditions were unfavourable for interception, and only two enemy aircraft are known to have been destroyed, although two others areprobable casualties.37. On three nights of the week German long-range bombers were inactive,and on the remainder operations were on a much reduced scale. London was theprincipal target on the 27th and 29th December, when 90 and 130 aircraft respectively were engaged. The second of these attacks, which was confined tothe early part of the night, was delivered mainly with incendiary bombs andresulted in most serious fires in the City and Docks. An attack was made onPlymouth on the 28th by about twenty-five aircraft, and on the lst/2nd Januarya somewhat heavier attack was made on various Midland and North-Westerntowns; bombs were also dropped at three points in Eire, causing some casualties.Axis broadcasts have referred to raids on Great Britain by Italian aircraft, butthere has been no other evidence of such activity.Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying.38. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 144 patrols involving 441 sorties(including 193 convoy escorts), in addition to the bombing operations already referred to. No fewer than six attacks were made on enemy merchant vessels onthe 27th December; a Hudson bombed a ship of about 4,000 tons at anchor in
Egersund Harbour and secured at least three direct hits; another ship in convoyNorth of Ameland was possibly hit, and near misses were reported on two merchant vessels oft Dieppe and another off Fecamp. : - - ,39. Weather conditions interfered with photographic reconnaissance on anumber of days. On the 1st January, however, extensive operations were carriedout and photographs were; taken over many channel ports and in the BremenWilhelmshaven and Bergen areas. During the week mines were laid by bothBomber Command and Coastal Command aircraft off Kiel, Havre St Nazaireand Brest.40. Enemy minelaying was reported only on two nights and was on a considerably reduced scale. Enemy coastal reconnaissance operations were alsoslightly reduced. ^Malta.41. During the week reconnaissances were made of the Ionian Sea and of ports in Southern Italy and Sicily; Pantellaria and Tripoli were also visited.During some of these flights enemy fighters were sighted, but did not attack.42. Three formations of enemy aircraft flew over Malta on the 29thDecember, probably on reconnaissance, and on the following day three bombersescorted by fighters attacked Luqa aerodrome; three bombs were dropped and oneof our aircraft was slightly damaged. Attempts to intercept these formationswere unsuccessful.Greece and Albania. .....43. Our bombers have continued their attacks on Valona and have attackedKrionero, the loading port for Albanian crude oil. Eight Blenheims took partin a successful attack on the latter, and sustained some damage from Italian,fighters, though all returned to their base. A number of the enemy broke off thecombat as if damaged. Valona was raided on three occasions by a total of eighteen Blenheims, which successfully bombed the aerodrome and harbour in very bad weather.   Two aircraft were lost in the course of these operations.On the 30th December Blenheims shot down an Italian flying boat, whilecovering the landing of Greek supplies at Preveza. A Gladiator destroyed an italian bomber south of Salonica.Egypt and Libya.44. Operations this week have continued on a he,avy soale. The port and shipping at Tripoli, enemy landing grounds and the defences of Bardia have provided the principal targets. On the night of the 1st/2nd January tenWellingtons from Malta dropped over eighteen tons of bombs on the port works and shipping at Tripoli. Direct hits were seen on a number of merchant vessels and near the power station, seaplane hangars and customs jetty. All our aircraftreturned undamaged. On the following day a merchant vessel and a destroyerpreviously located there were not seen, but a large oil patch covered one-third ofthe harbour.45. The aerodromes at Derna, Tmimi and Gazala were twice heavily attacked, by fifteen Blenheims on the 29th December and by twenty-seven on the1st January. Nine Blenheims attacking Derna on the 1st were intercepted by asingle OR. 42, which pressed home the most determined attacks and damaged five of them. Wellingtons have continued these attacks hy night, At least five andprobably many more enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. On the 31sttwenty-seven Blenheims attacked enemy troops and transport in the BardiaDefence Zone.46. Our fighters have continued to maintain their ascendancy over theItalian Air Force. On the 26th Gladiators of the Royal Australian Air Forceshot down without loss two, and probably six, of a number of C.R. 42 fighters&quot;which were escorting a bomber formation, and on the 28th Hurricanes shot downthree bombers and a fighter, again without loss.
47. Sollum was the only objective of Italian bombers during the week andwas attacked on several occasions but, except for some slight damage in one attack,without effect.Sudan and Bast Africa.48. Our offensive operations have continued in the Sudan and East Africa.Enemy camps on the Sudan-Abyssinia frontier have been repeatedly attacked by bombs and machine-gun fire. The camp and aerodrome at Gubba were twiceattacked and an aircraft on the ground probably destroyed. Direct hits were observed on an enemy post guarding a telephone line near Kassala. On the1st January three Hardy aircraft attacked enemy positions fifty miles north-east of Kassala, destroying four lorries and starting a large fire.49. Transport and supply dumps at Assab have twice been attacked by aircraft from Aden and a repair shop at Dessie damaged. Fighters have patrolledAden and have flown many convoy escorts and anti-submarine patrols over the TiedSea.. Bombing of the Quteibis has continued.50. On the Kenya-Abyssinia frontier and in Somaliland the South AfricanAir Force has maintained offensive reconnaissances.51. Italian air activity has been negligible. El Wak was attacked on the29th, but it was not then occupied by our troops.Air Intelligence.Italy.52. It is becoming increasingly evident that Italian aircraft resources arebeing taxed to the fullest extent.The heavy bombing attacks on Adriatic ports have forced the Italians to rely more and more on air transport. All civil aircraft have been withdrawnfrom their normal traffic for this purpose and the presence of several Germantroop carriers is a further indication of the serious efforts which are being madeto ensure supplies and reinforcements for the Albanian expeditionary force, andto maintain communications between Italy&apos;s various theatres of war.It is also reliably reported that, owing to the necessity of sending air rein-forcements to Libya almost continuously since the opening of the British offensive,the Italian Air Staff are becoming apprehensive with regard to the aircraftposition, particularly in respect of fighters.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.53. By day, the only incidents of note occurred when a single enemy aircraftdid some damage at Thornycroft&apos;s Woolston Works and in the Docks atSouthampton : and again when damage and several casualties were inflicted atthe Rolls Royce Works at Crewe, also by a single enemy machine.By night the most important attack was that delivered against London,mainly in the City, on the night 29th/30th December when a very large numberof incendiary bombs were dropped, and serious and extensive fires numberingin all nearly 1,500 were started in the City and the Docks area. In the Citythe fire at one period extended over half a square mile and in the Minories areaover quarter of a square mile.Damage.London.   (29th/30th December.)54. (a) Docks. The actual working of the docks was interfered with in three cases Surrey Commercial, Millwall and London Docks. The most con-siderable damage was, however, to warehouses and sheds, With their inflammablecontents.(b) Railways. Services were suspended at Waterloo, Charing Cross,Fenchurch Street, Broad Street and Cannon Street and sixteen undergroundstations were closed.   By 0800 on the 31st December 40 per cent, services were
restored at all termini with the exception of Fenchurch Street. Though theposition has greatly improved, working is still retarded, and considerablecongestion remains. .(c) Factories. Four important food-factories in the Dock area were hit,but fortunately damage was unimportant. Buck and Hickman, Ltd. (machine-tools) was burnt out; otherwise Key Point factories escaped serious damage.(d) Public Utilities. The South Metropolitan Gas Works and the BanksideElectricity Power Station both suffered minor damage and, generally, only local and temporary damage was done to main services.(e) Telecommunications. Post Office property suffered severely, the CentralTelegraph Office, with three Telephone Exchanges housed in the same building,were completely gutted : fires also occurred in three other Exchanges. Consider-able dislocation of communications resulted, especially between London and theSouth-East of England.(f) Public Buildings and Hospitals: TTie most serious loss is that of theGuildhall, which was destroyed, while eight Wren Churches in the City were moreor less severely damaged. St. Stephen&apos;s, Westminster, Westminster Cathedraland Bryanston- Square Church were also affected. Trinity House was almostentirely destroyed. Damage was also done to the Royal Courts of Justice, theTower, the British Maiseum and Public Record Office, County Hall, WestminsterCity Hall. Guy&apos;s Hospital had to be evacuated and other hospitals and nursinghomes were damaged in Hoiborn (3), Lambeth, Waltham Cross, Bermondsey,Stepney and Camberwell.(g) Service Property. R.A.F. stores were damaged at the. White CityStadium and three Army Huts burnt in Hyde Park. In Stepney and Southwarkvarious A.R.P. establishments were damaged.Elsewhere.55. Southampton. Damage was done to ships under construction atThornycroffs Works (see Naval Situation). Some damage was also done inSouthampton docks and a tug was sunk.Crewe. Some damage was done to buildings at the Rolls Royce Works, butcomparatively little to plant. Production was, however, delayed for 18 hoursowing to interference with the electrical supply.Civilian Casualties.56. For the week ending 0600 1st January, the approximate figures are 257killed and 795 injured. The London figures for this period were 230 killed and769, injured.Unexploded Bombs and Mines.57. The total outstanding for disposal has been reduced from 1.753 to1,544.Civil Defence and Morale.58.   The attack on London on the night of the 29th/30th December produced a critical fire situation, and the fire services were fully extended; it was not untilI ^the morning of the 1st January that all fires could be reported under control.1/      The danger of relaxing vigilance in Civil Defence at week-ends was/ disastrously illustrated; and, in this connection, it is of interest to note that ofthe nine Sundays in November and December, seven were the occasions of majorraids directed at the largely depopulated areas of the big cities.Reports still show general morale to be good, with a considerable encourage-ment derived from the recent British and Greek successes.Assessment of Damage in Manchester.59. An assessment of the industrial damage which occurred in the manchester raids of the 22nd/23rd and 23rd/24th December, and which was notavailable for inclusion in the last Resume, is given below.[22083] d
60. In the City of Manchester, the main attack centred on the commercial and warehouse districts, where the number of vital factories is not great-however, in some cases a vital factory, although not directly hit, was involved indamage by fire owing to being sandwiched between warehouses and other placescontaining inflammable material.61. The damage to vital factories is now known to be less severe than was at first believed, and the effect on production may be regarded as being of atemporary character. Even where the damage has been of a more severe natureits effect has been greater on the fabric of the building. The salvage of plant andits re-housing in requisitioned premises will do much to restore production.62. The damage to Utilities affected producing units rather than streetmains and cables.For example, the gas plant at Stretford suffered damage to a gas holder, and much of the roofing was blown off. This stopped production for a time, but onthe 27th December the supply was restored to the Trafford Park district. Certaindomestic supplies are still obstructed by presence of water in gas mains.The only substantial incident connected with electricity was an unexplodedparachute mine in the Stretford Power Station; this was satisfactorily dealt withon the 26th December.Two of the main water-pipe lines from Thirlmere to Manchester were damaged. These supplied water to the north of Manchester, and there was a partial interruption of supply. Supplies were diverted to this area from theLongdendale source, and it was not necessary to make use of water carts.The Central Telephone Exchange was, at one time, in great danger, but the rapid demolition of adjoining buildings prevented the fire from getting a hold,and no great damage resulted.63. The general impression of the damage in Trafford Park is that vitalplant and machinery was affected much less than the building structure; thispresumably because the attack was made principally by I.Bs. and parachutemines.64. Interspersed timber storages and warehouses containing inflammablematerial aided the destruction by fire.   In this connection it may be noted thatWIB ouiuuc SuurUgc ux ju . iiuboci aiiu v^u., jljlu..,  vva,a uuilll Out.65. Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co., Ltd., covers a large target area;it was therefore unlikely that it would escape damage. In fact, these worksreceived several hits from, both H.E. and I.Bs. but the cumulative effect of the damage cannot be regarded as serious.66. Oil installations were largely unaffected except for the Mode Wheelinstallation of the Anglo-American Oil Co., Ltd., where the actual loss of oilwas low, but the loss of working equipment was relatively high.
