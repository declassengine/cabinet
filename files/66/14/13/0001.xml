(40) 483.December 16, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.REPORTS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ROYAL AIR FORCEBOMBING   OPERATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE herewith (reference W.M. (40) 297 (Min. 1)) selectedextracts from a large number of reports which have been received of the damage caused by RAP. bombing operations over Germany.   Those at Appendix A are1favourable and at Appendix B adverse.2. Their testimony is conflicting. A noticeable proportion of the reports which minimise * our achievements do, however, emanate from journalistic and diplomatic sources subject to German censorship and control. Of those whichare favourable many are received from neutral industrialists in close contact with german firms, whose reports can, in consequence, be regarded as more reliable.3. We must be careful in assessing the value of these reports to relate themto the effort employed. We have, for example, dropped 500 tons of bombs on berlin (to which a considerable number of unfavourable reports refer), and thesemostly in the suburbs, by contrast to the 14 or 15,000 tons of bombs whichhave fallen on London. We have dropped them accurately; a high degree of concentration on vital objectives is imperative with a limited bomber force. TheGermans are notoriously expert at concealing bomb damage, and it is hardtysurprising, therefore, that the damage to Berlin is not immediately noticeableto the ordinary observer.4. Several reports refer to the small amount of damage to Naples. But wehave only carried out 14 sorties and dropped 13 tons of bombs on this city. the major difficulties of operating from Malta, with only one small aerodrome and animprovised maintenance service, have precluded a heavier scale of attack.5. In many cases, too, an unfavourable impression is created not so muchby the absolute effect of our bombing raids as by their effect relative to the publicity which they are given. A certain amount of exaggeration is perhapsinevitable; some may be considered necessary, as an antidote to the rathermournful details which appear in the Press describing the effects of Germanraids on this country. But our successes have, in fact, been exaggerated beyond any limits which can be justified on these grounds. This has not, I submit, been due to our pilots and crews, and in support of this statement I reproduce an[22032] b
extract from a recent report by the Air Officer Commanding one of the BomberGroups :- Hot news &apos; journalists must live (or live under that obsession), andthe sensational treatment of the most sober communiques by lifting a wordor a sentence from its context, black-leading the type, over-straining theimagination and splashing colour in the blanks is their normal means ofsurvival. It would be hard, indeed, that their sins should ever be visited onour crews, who have no defence. As for the crews themselves, in a year&apos;experience I have heard hundreds of verbal reports delivered hot from thechase; and missed reading, I daresay, not one personal experience reportof some 7,000 odd sorties, and I cannot recall ever having had occasion even to suspect deliberate exaggeration by the crews. Much the reverse, in fact.They are the first to criticise and belittle their own achievements. They aretongue-tied, reserved and, indeed, over-modest.&quot;6. There is, moreover, a natural tendency in the Press to feature attacks on well-known places and to give them a prominence which is not justified by thescale of our effort against them. Disproportionate, publicity is, for example, givento Berlin and Munich by comparison with less spectacular but far heavier andmore frequent assaults on the Ruhr and Rhineland.7. We realise that our bombs have not always been large enough for theirtargets. On the other hand, for use against certain types of targets smaller-typebombs are preferable; for example, in attacks on oil plants where fragmentationover the largest possible area is required. Moreover, some of the heaviest-typebombs were designed for use in the larger aircraft which have not yet come into full service use. Some existing aircraft cannot carry them at all and others, owingto space limitations, only in uneconomical loads.8. There is no complacency about the results of our attacks. Larger bombs are now being carried whenever possible and desirable. Constant development ofbomb design is proceeding. We learn from reported failures. Close enquiries are made not only into the construction of our bombs but also into their armingand loading by technical and maintenance personnel in the squadrons.9. From a close examination of all the evidence available on the results ofour raids over both Germany and Italy, the Air Staff conclude that, whileexaggerated claims have been made in the Press, the effect of our bombs on germany has been greater relatively to the size of the force at our disposal thanthe results of the German attacks on this country.A.

Favourable Reports.Extracts from Raid Assessment Summaries.THE letters in parentheses indicate the reliability of reports as assessed by the Intelligence Department: A   -  Confirmed Report.B = Reliable.C = Dubious.Stettin. 29.9.40.The synthetic oil plant at Politz has been damaged. This source also statesthat a Swedish tanker about to go to Stettin to load petrol has now receivedorders to postpone its sailing.Berlin.   9.10.40.An informant in Berlin on the 29th August reports that a new four-storeybuilding near the Anhalter Bahnhof was hit. This building was about to be utilised by Mercedes Benz and the necessary machinery has been installed. Theupper part of the building was destroyed. On the same night, bombs fell on theSiemens works, damage being done to the. workshops where photo-optic equipment for the Luftwaffe was being manufactured. The U-Bahn ceased running in this district owing to the destruction of the vital cable. The damage done must havebeen considerable as the whole area was guarded by Police and Military.Hamburg.- 10.10.40.All secret reports on the bombings of this city confirm the accuracy of ourbombing. They invariably report that it is the industrial districts that have suffered damage and that the city itself (which was never the subject of attack)is practically untouched. t The German Press have admitted that on the night of the 10th October an area of 1 kilometre was completely destroyed in two different districts. Photographs taken recently disclose a fire in the RhenaniaOssag oil refinery. The largest Margarine Factory in Germany was hit at an early stage and set on fire. A considerable tonnage of whale and other oil was destroyed. Six out of 27 submarines building in the yard are reported to havebeen damaged beyond repair. Several ships have been hit and sunk in the harbour,the largest known being the liner Milwaukee of over 16,000 tons. It is reportedthat ships have to unload into barges because of there being no cranes available.Without a special permit only V&amp;rty Officials and S.S. men are allowed to travelfrom other parts of Germany to Hamburg.Bordeaux.  30.10.40.Source, Assistant Manager of Texas Company in France for 7^ years. Hewas at the refinery when it was bombed by the R.A.F. on the 15th August andthe 21st August. He states that &quot; in both raids the bombing was very accurate.&quot;On the 15th August the chief target was the intermediate tank farm whereseveral thousands of barrels of finished and unfinished products were destroyed and a number of empty tanks were hit. The fires lasted for about three days.These tanks were protected by concrete walls around each tank, which gaveexcellent protection (a) by requiring almost a direct hit to destroy a tank, and(&amp;) by preventing burning oil from spreading.The second raid on the 21st August was more effective as the chief targetwas the crude and fuel oil tank farm where tanks were not protected by concretewalls. One plane came within 150 metres above the crude oil tanks and caused considerable damage.   The fire burned for some eight days.[22032] - B 2
(A) Berlin.A report dated the 5th November states that, although raids have becomefewer in number, their intensity was greater, resulting in more material damage and moral effect than heretofore. Siemensstadt received two hits causing considerable damage, but attacks on Tempelhof were unsuccessful. Attacks on railway junctions had been much .more effective and a subway in the StettinerStation was hit, causing considerable casualties. A fine wood factory has been set on fire and the damage estimated at over 7 million marks.(B) Berlin.As to Siemens, reports have been received that production has ceased, thatit is proposed to transfer to Vienna, that all orders of branches in Iran have been cancelled and that numerous employees of Siemens Schuckert are temporarilyunemployed as the works have been so severely damaged that a large part is ata standstill.(A) Hamburg.On the night of the 5th-6th November the oil port was burnt out.The raids on the nights of the 15th and 16th November were the heaviest ofthe war. Six factories were destroyed and dumps of war material hit. Akerosene depot was set on fire and an important railway station damaged. heavy damage was inflicted upon the Blohm and Voss shipbuilding yards. Many places in the neighbourhood were hit and casualties were extremely severe.^B)    Unna.A neutral businessman who recently visited the Stahlwerk Unna Muller inWestphalia reports that the works was badly damaged by bombs.  He states thatit could not maintain its output and some time was likely to elapse before normal-production was resumed.(B) Stettin.In the early part of October heavy damage was done to the Vulkan Shipyardsand to the Freihafen; 21 cisterns containing aviation spirit were hit and fired,the fires lasting three days. The official announcement stated that only twocisterns were destroyed.(A)   Canals.Photographs have shown one aqueduct on the Dortmund-Ems canal broken. and the other badly damaged.(A)   Berlin.Neutral journalist recently in Berlin quotes the following instance of Germanattempt to minimise the damage caused by bombing. Foreign journalists takento Charite hospital to witness the damage caused by bombing were not allowedto report that hospital was only slightly damaged, while direct hit had beenobtained on industrial target on other side of canal. He also confirms the Germanefficiency in the clearing of debris with rapidity.APPENDIX B.Adverse Reports.BERLIN Press Correspondents of American papers report that, up to the16th October, the material damage caused by the R.A.F. in Berlin was negligible,but their nuisance value considerable.(A.A., Berne.)An American journalist, who left Berlin about the 11th November, statesthat British bombs are still far too light and frequently do no damage when theyfall on concrete roofs.(British Minister, Sofia.)
Mr. Warren, of the United States Department, who had been inspectingUnited States Missions in Europe, states that the damage is not so great asbelieved in England. He considers our aircraft too few and bombs too light.Moreover, though carefully aimed, the latter fall wide, probably owing to theheight at which aircraft fly to avoid the barrage.(British Minister, Bulgaria.)The Swedish Consul-General at Hamburg was recently taken round the docksfor four hours and saw little damage. Impression in Stockholm is that material damage is not heavy.(A.A., Stockholm..) &apos;An experienced German pilot in October states he had to spend continuousnights in the cellar of his house near the Tempelhof. He did not, however, regard the bombardment as effective in view of the small size and weight of the bombs dropped, but admitted that the parachute flares used were effective in lightingup a large area for a sufficiently long time to enable accurate bombing to takeplace.(Secret Service Source.)A reliable source reports that in raid on Voelklingen in the Saar 44 bombs were dropped. Bombing of foundry was very well done and accurate, but bombsthemselves were too light to cause really serious damage. Six bombs failed toexplode.(A.A., Berne.)Friends of A.A., Lisbon, who left Berlin in the middle of October, informed him that there had been a great many duds, particularly in Hamburg, and manyof the bombs which had been dropped in the centre of Berlin had failed, to explode.(A.A., Lisbon.)Many bombs which did not explode have been dropped on Hamburg, wherethe police have been obliged to evacuate whole blocks and accommodate theoccupants in hotels which they commandeer.(Secret Service Report.)The comparatively small size of bombs which the British have to take to berlin reduces the damage done.  Thus, underground shelters have not suffered.This source further states that lately the British have begun to use a timebomb, which explodes on penetrating deeper into the building, with very good effect.(Secret Service Report.)The R.A.F. has great moral effect, but material damage is small. A largenumber of small-calibre bombs do not explode. It is difficult to ascertain the truthowing to severe prohibition of talk about raids.(Secret Service Reports.)The bombs on Dusseldorf towards the end of August appear to have been oftoo small a size to do much damage or penetrate further than the second or thirdfloor after penetrating the roof.  Factories were not greatly damaged.(A. A., Belgrade.)Naples.   25.11.40.A neutral Consul who has just left his post at Naples has given me followingdetails regarding British bombing there :-Effects so far have been slight. The port has not been touched. Three bombswhich fell on Central Station were of small calibre and did little damage. Onefell on a customs warehouse, but shattered only small part of building. Sevenbombs dropped on Raffineria Di Napoli and hit the tank (group undecypherable)in direct line of tanks, but not one exploded.(Consul-General, Barcelona,)Naples.   27.11,40.American Consul-General, just arrived from Naples, says our bombs were well aimed, but did not do much harm as several failed to explode, and particularly those over the station.(Ambassador, Madrid.)
Geneva.   25.11.40.1. Genevan private banker with Italian sympathies who was in Naples lastweek tells me that he visited an aeroplane factory there and saw four R.A.F. bombswhich had been planted accurately on the road through the factory, but whichfailed to explode.2. Brazilian businessmen who have been buying war munitions in germany on Brazilian Government&apos;s account said they were in Essen during a large-scaleraid and that very little real damage was done to Krupps&apos; works because bombsused were too small.(Consul-General, Geneva.)
