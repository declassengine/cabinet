(40) 484.December 18, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be takejjj/toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.REPORT BY THE FAR EASTERN COMMITTEE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may perhaps be interested to read at leisure the attachednote by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on theprogress made up to date by the Far Eastern Committee, of which he is theChairman.H.Foreign Office, December 18, 1940.Secretary of State,YOU asked me some time ago to keep you informed of the progress of our work on the Far Eastern Committee. I have hesitated to send you all the minutesand papers which circulate between our members who represent all Departmentsconcerned, but think it may be valuable to you and perhaps to some of your colleagues to read a short appreciation of what we have been trying to achieve.I have prepared this with the aid of the Far Eastern Department.2. The general task of the Committee was to keep under review our policyin the Far East, with particular regard to co-operation with the Dominion andother interested Governments. I venture to think that the system of appointing a committee to co-ordinate Government policy towards a particular part of theworld is a valuable one, since it prevents delay and provides a funnel through which a thought-out line of action can be submitted to higher authority, thuspromoting unity of policy. I know that I am very grateful for the advice and help which I have received.3. I look upon the handling of Japan, which is the kernel of our far eastern policy, as a vital aspect of the war situation. It is obviously important for us in present circumstances to avoid war with Japan if we can, but it maynot lie with us to prevent this. Japan is committed to the establishment of aNew Order in Greater East Asia, She is also linked by an alliance to our enemies.The first involves the expansion of Japanese influence in Asia and the pacific area to the further prejudice of British interests in the Far East, alreadydamaged by Japan&apos;s incursion into China,&apos; while the second means that she islikely to be encouraged by our enemies to attack those interests if she gets the chance.4. The particular task of the Far Eastern Committee was stated in its termsof reference to be : To concert measures of precaution or pressure against Japan;to facilitate resistance to her, and to diminish her war potential, while bearing11239   [22031] b
in mind the great importance of avoiding action likely to provoke Japan intoaggression against our own possessions in the Far East or the Netherlands east indies.5. This is a course which is not easy to steer. The &quot; China incident&quot;remains a cause of fundamental disagreement between the Japanese and ourselves, and it is obvious that one of the most effective means of restrainingJapan from adventure elsewhere is to keep her tied up in China. On the otherhand, the difficulty of maintaining normal Anglo-Japanese relations, while japan is encouraging and assisting our enemies and we hers, needs no emphasis fromme. The Committee.has, however, carefully watched contentious issues, such, forexample, as the reopening of the Burma road and the unloading of the mercuryfrom the Nagaru Maru, with the aim of achieving our main object with theminimum of provocation.With this introduction, I will try to describe briefly the scope of the workwhich the Far Eastern Committee has undertaken.Strategic questions.6. The Committee has realised that the first essential is that there shouldbe the closest co-operation with the United States and Netherlands governments with the object of presenting a firm and united front as the most likely means ofrestraining the Japanese from further aggression. While, therefore, strategicquestions are not primarily its responsibility, it has worked in close co-operationwith the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and has done everything in its power toassist in bringing about staff conversations with the United States and with themilitary authorities in the Netherlands East Indies.Measures of precaution.7. The Committee has concerned itself with the question of evacuation ofBritish subjects from Japanese-controlled areas, and with certain steps whichmight have to be taken in the event of the outbreak of hostilities with Japan.Measures of economic restriction.8. The Committee has made considerable progress by encouraging theadoption in the Empire of a general policy of restriction of exports to Japanwith the double object of preventing the Japanese from assisting our presentenemies and from building up stocks themselves. Machinery is now in existencein every part of the Empire in the form of licensing control whereby pressurecan be tightened as and when the need arises. The general policy at which theCommittee is aiming is to limit exports to Japan to normal figures in respect ofall commodities which are regarded as German, Italian or Japanese deficiencies(e.g., tin and rubber from Malaya), except where stricter embargoes are already in force, e.g., in the case of jute from India and nickel from Canada. The policyof the United States of America has been rather different. They have imposedcomplete embargoes on a few special commodities, e.g., molybdenum, aluminium,scrap iron, &amp;c. These embargoes can often be defended by the United States ofAmerica on the ground of supply difficulties, which do not apply to the BritishEmpire, but they expect us to follow their policy in this matter, and we have done so, e.g., in the case of nickel and scrap iron. Meanwhile, the United States ofAmerica at present impose no export control on many other commodities copper,cotton, &amp;c. and accordingly Japan can obtain supplies from the United Statesof America without any restriction to normal trade.9. All the Dominions, as well as India and Burma, have accepted theUnited Kingdom policy in principle, but Australia and Canada have emphasised the necessity of parallel American action if this policy is to be fully effective andnot fraught with political danger. The Netherlands Authorities, with whom there have been discussions, take much the same line. From the economic stand-point, it is difficult to justify restrictions on exports, such as cotton, which would damage the interests of our producers if the only result is that Japan obtains herrequirements from the United States of America.
10. This had been appreciated from the start, and in the original approach to the Dominions stress was laid on the importance attached to the earliestpossible realisation of a joint economic policy towards Japan on the part of theUnited States, the Dutch and other Allied Governments, the Dominion Govern-ments and ourselves. Owing to election uncertainties our proposals have as yetonly been discussed in an informal manner with the United States Administra-tion. We have now suggested that the problems should be tackled by HisMajesty&apos;s Embassy in a more official way so that definite progress may be made.The necessity for rapid action is clear from the fact that Japan is known to bebuilding up her main requirements as rapidly as possible. Her aim is thought to be to secure at least one year&apos;s supply of every important commodity. Sheappears to have enough petroleum for nine months&apos; warfare.11. As regards purely United Kingdom action, Japan has been placed on the&quot; C &quot; List, and is thus treated as a dangerous destination for the purpose of our export control. This action does not involve any overt discrimination, since anumber of other neutrals, Russia for example, and certain countries, such asPortugal and Turkey, with whom His Majesty&apos;s Government have the closestrelations, are also included.12. Besides these measures, on which a Sub-Committee under the Chairman-ship of Sir F. Leith-Ross has been working, the question of restricting importsfrom Japan is being studied. Such restrictions are not without difficulty both ofa legal and practical nature. In the first place, His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound by a treaty of 1911 not to impose discriminatory restrictions against japanese imports. Secondly, there might be difficulty in finding alternative sources of supply for our two major imports from Japan, viz., canned salmon andraw silk. Japanese silk is of particular importance for the making of parachutes.The Colonial Empire has also depended largely upon Japan for the supply of cheap textiles, but here the question is being studied of finding alternative sources in the United Kingdom and India. The United States market is even moreimportant to Japan and there would appear to be less economic difficulties inrestricting Japanese exports to the United States of America than in restrictingthem to the British Empire. Sir R. Craigie has emphasised that Japan isprobably more vulnerable to measures against her exports than against herimports, and there are signs that the American Government are beginning toperceive that a measure directed against the import of silk from Japan would, bemore likely to be successful than the embargo which they recently imposed on theexport of certain high grades of petrol to Japan.13. This embargo bore all the marks of hasty improvisation without due con-sideration of its possible effects. Its immediate result was the increase of japanese pressure on the Netherlands East Indies and the despatch thither of a japanese delegation with large demands for oil. Fortunately, the Dutch, by amixture of conciliation and firmness, managed to spin out the negotiations and toarrive at a compromise. But the situation was for some time difficult, and thoughit was handled, so far as British oil interests was concerned, by the interested departments and primarily the Petroleum Department, the Far Eastern Com-mittee watched it closely in its relation to general policy.Shipping Questions.14. The Ministry of Economic Warfare are preparing a list of suspectship-owning companies in order to black-list those against which definite evidence is available.The withdrawal of British and Allied shipping from Japanese trades hasbeen considered from two points of view. First, it is desirable to withdraw as many vessels as possible from areas in which they would be liable to loss if Japanentered the war. Secondly, it is desirable to reduce as much as possible, without incurring serious political difficulties, chartered tonnage at present serving Japan.Thus she is thrown to an increasing extent on to her own shipping resources,which, particularly in the case of Tankers, are not adequate to her full require-ments. Steps have.been and will continue to be taken to pursue these desirableobjectives.The Ship Warrant Scheme, in which Japanese ships are not allowed hytheir Government to participate, has been used as a means of showing that British-[22031] B 2
controlled -facilities are of use throughout the world. A token delay of up to24 hours is being imposed on Japanese vessels in ports throughout the BritishCommonwealth at the discretion of the local authorities.Financial Pressure.15. The Committee agreed, after consulting the Dominions and Sir R.Craigie, that the Treasury should counter the Japanese delay in negotiating apayments agreement by. informing the Japanese Embassy that unless agreement was reached (on a basis less favourable to Japan than that offered in August)within a month of the 16th November, the Treasury would themselves take stepsto secure that Japanese-owned sterling could only be used within the sterling area.The grant of credit to Japan had been spontaneously reduced by UnitedKingdom banks, &amp;c, largely for motives of business prudence, since the outbreakof the China Incident, to a&apos;much lower level than was previously normal. Littleremained to be done in this field, but steps have been taken to ensure that through-out the Empire cash on shipment is paid for exports to Japan or at least that no more favourable credit terms are on balance granted for such exports than the exporting Dominion obtains for its imports from Japan.Effect of action taken or envisaged.16. The Committee is fully alive to the fact that the cumulative effect ofthese various measures may be considerable. There is already evidence that theJapanese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs has had his attention drawn to thepreliminary operation of our restrictions and that we shall be closely watched.The screw will have to be applied, more or less firmly, in proportion as theJapanese control their wayward tendencies, or as our hand grows stronger inEurope and the Middle East or as the United States Administration interestsitself more in the Far East.Assistance to China.17. As indicated earlier, the restraining of Japan almost necessarilyinvolves positive assistance to China. The Committee has devoted a good deal of attention to this question and will continue to watch the best methods of pursuingit. It originally recommended the course of action now adopted by the WarCabinet, namely, the grant of  5 million for currency stabilisation purposes anda credit up to an equivalent amount for purchases within the sterling area. it also supported the idea which has now been adopted of raising the rank of theMilitary Attache in China and of augmenting his staff with a view to improvingmilitary liaison with China and preparing the way for the eventual despatch ofa Military Mission at a more suitable moment.Two matters on which decisions have yet to be taken are (a) Whether to assist the Chinese Government by allowing the assemblyof aircraft in Burma or India (possibly transferring the plant of theLoiwing Factory for the purpose); and *(&amp;) Whether to send, in response to a proposal by Chiang Kai-shek, aneconomic mission to China.Meanwhile, the Committee has encouraged closer relations between Burma and china and has recommended a suggestion which has been made to the ChineseGovernment that a small mission from Burma should visit China in the nearfuture to discuss questions of mutual interest, such as communications. Themain normal channels of communication with China through the China coast ports and the connecting railways are closed by the Japanese occupation.Indo-China and Thailand.18. The progress of Japanese influence in South-east Asia has obliged theCommittee to pay constant attention to our policy in regard to these two countries.The Committee has been preoccupied with the problem of encouraging resistance to further Japanese encroachments. In Indo-China this has meant refraining from any subversive movement in favour of de Gaulle in the hope that either theconstituted authorities or the army independently would feel strong enough to withstand Japanese demands. The position has been complicated by the dispute between Thailand and Indo-China arising out of Thailand&apos;s territorial claims.
Unless we are careful, and, in particular, if we antagonise the Thais, as the americans appear to have done by lack of sympathy with their claims, thesituation may develop to the sole benefit of Japan.19. The question of the policy which we should pursue in regard to Indo-China and Thailand is very complicated and puzzling. The Committee is atpresent engaged on sorting out the various elements with a view to putting theposition before the United States Government and trying to arrive at a commonline of action with them.20. Meanwhile, as the French Authorities in Indo-China appeared to be acting under Japanese dictation and had recently adopted an unfriendly attitudetowards British trade and shipping interests, an embargo has, on the advice ofthe Committee, been placed generally on exports from the Empire to Indo-China.This measure will serve to reduce the economic benefits to Japan of the political position which she is seeking in Indo-China and appears already to have produced a salutary effect on the French. An opportunity may occur for some modus vivendi between ourselves and the French Administration allowing a limitedtrade. If so, one of the objects of the Committee will be to ensure that so faras possible Indo-China does not become a source of supply for our enemies inEurope or for Japan, while continuing to supply rice and coal required byneighbouring British territories.General.21. The problems which have come before the Committee have only served to strengthen my conviction that diplomatic persuasion and economic pressuredepend for their ultimate effectiveness upon a backing of potential force It istrue that it is difficult to build up our defences in the Far East without imperillingour position elsewhere, but Japan will continue to be a real danger on our flankm the present war until, by increasing our own armed strength in the Far Eastand by creating a firm front with the United States, we can convince her thatit will not be worth her while to intervene.December 17, 1940.(Intld.)
