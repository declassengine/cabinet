naval SITUATION.General Review.The principal event of the week has been a particularly heavy U-boat attackon a homeward-bound convoy from Halifax. Our shipping losses remain high,due mainly to submarine attack, and in part to sinkings by raiders.There was an inconclusive night encounter between destroyers in theChannel.Minelaying by enemy aircraft has been less intense.Home Waters.2. On the night of the 28th/29th November enemy destroyers sank and damaged a few small craft south-east of the Lizard. Five of our destroyersencountered 3 enemy destroy^ers and a brief engagement ensued, in the courseof which H.M.S. Javelin was torpedoed and one enemy destroyer was believed to be damaged by gunfire. The enemy immediately retired under cover of smokeand contact was soon lost. Our forces swept towards Brest until daylight butfailed to regain touch with the enemy. H.M.S. Javelin with her bow and sternblown off, was successfully towed into harbour on the 29th in spite of repeatedenemy air attacks. Air reconnaissance of Brest on the morning of the 29thshowed 3 destroyers in harbour, one of which was damaged.3. H.M.S. Fame, which ran ashore off the Tyne in October, has been refloatedand towed into harbour.H.M. Canadian Destroyer Saguenay was torpedoed by a U-Boat in theNorth-Western Approaches early on the 1st December, but arrived safely in harbour on the 4th.   Twenty-one of her crew are missing.H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Forfar was torpedoed and sunk by a U-Boatin the North-Western Approaches on the 2nd December whilst escorting a Halifaxconvoy. She remained afloat for several hours and fifteen officers and 124 ratingsare known to have been rescued, but full reports have not yet been received.Light forces carried out a sweep off the Norwegian coast on the night of the3rd/4th December, but no enemy vessels were met.Dover was shelled on the 28th and 29th November without damage to naval units. In air raids on Southampton five auxiliary patrol craft were slightly andtwo seriously damaged.Foreign Waters.4; H.M.S. Leander bombarded the factory near Mogadishu, italian somaliland, on the 29th November, causing considerable damage and starting twofires.  At the same time her aircraft bombed the D.F. Station.H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Carnarvon Castle removed 22 german merchant Navy Officers and men from the Brazilian M.V. Itape near Rio deJaneiro about the 30th November.A preliminary report has been received that the Carnarvon Castle was inaction with a German raider 600 miles north-east of the Plate on the5th December. She expended a large amount of her ammunition and sufferedsome casualties and damage. The enemy was last seen steering to the north-eastward at 19 knots, which is one knot faster than Carnarvon Castle&apos;s maximumspeed.In the Mediterranean H.M.S. Glasgow was torpedoed by enemy aircraft atSuda Bay on the afternoon of the 3rd December. She has since arrived at alexandria under her own steam and made good 16 knots on passage.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. Three attacks have been made on U-boats during the week. an aircraft of the Coastal Command claimed to have obtained a direct hit on aU-Boat off Inishtrahull on the 2nd December. On the same day TL.M..S.&apos; Kelvinmade a promising attack to the south-west of Cape St. Vincent, and H.M. ShipsSt. Laurent and Viscount depth-charged a firm contact in the vicinity of the halifax convoy which was attacked west of Ireland.
Enemy Intelligence.German6.   Air reconnaissance on the 29th November located the battleship Tirpitzin the. Bauhafen at Wilhelmshaven, and;3 destroyers at Brest,; s        &quot;,   ;,,-r - &apos;Five commerce raiders are believed to be at sea and operating in the followingareasWS^&apos;^   &apos;::.-][ .;v:0.^&apos;&apos;^ AiW^M /;;  Wo?&apos;-1 t^v^K^vwv^i oFl(a) East Atlantic, South of the Azores. &apos; &quot;&apos;&apos;(&amp;) Colombo-Straits of Malacca, Trade Route. ;(c) Cape of Good Hope-South Australia, Trade Route.(d) Borneo area and Indian Ocean.(e) Pernambuco  area  (engaged  by  H.M.S.   Carnarvon  Castle   on   the5th December).No news has been received of the first four raiders and it is possible, thoughunlikely, that only one ship is operating in areas (b) and (c).There is also no news of the Admiral Scheer, which may have returned toGermany.Italian.7. Air reconnaissance of Italian ports during the week showed 7 cruisers and the three damaged battleships at Taranto. The Littorio had moved to near the mouth of the harbour. Three cruisers were seen at Brindisi, three at Messinaand one at Maddalena (Sardinia).At Spezia on the 3rd December there was one Cavour class battleship along-side and an 8-inch and two 6-inch cruisers in dock.Submarines.8. During the period the average number of U-Boats operating in theNorth-Western Approaches has been eight German and three Italian.Inemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.Note. -The following figures give the losses which have been reported during the period covered by this Resume. They should not be confused withthe figures shown for the last week in the diagrams of shipping losses attachedat the back of the Resume, which show the actual losses for each completeweek since the outbreak of war and are only made up to midnight of Sunday-Monday of the week immediately preceding that covered by this Resume.Later figures are not included in the diagrams as they are likely to beunreliable, owing to delayed notifications and uncertainty regarding theresult of recent attacks.9. During the week ending Wednesday, 4th December, seventeen ships of106,456 total tonnage have been reported lost by enemy action^ and of thesethirteen ships (86,427 tons) were British.Of these totals seven British (37,564 tons) and one Greek (3,578 tons) were sunk by submarine, all except one in the North-Western Approaches. one british ship (483 tons) was lost by mine off the East Coast. Eight ships (64,831tons) were sunk by raider, but four of these were lost prior to September, and have only recently been confirmed. The remaining four (43,022 tons) were all Britishand were lost in the latter part of November; two of these were in the indian ocean, one off New Zealand and one sunk west of Bermuda.Twenty-five ships are reported as damaged, and of these eleven ships(60,833 tons) were torpedoed in a homeward-bound convoy from Halifax on the2nd December, which was attacked by, it is believed, a concentration of three submarines. There is, at present little exact information about these ships, butit is feared that a high proportion of these will be total losses. Details of shipssunk and damaged will be found in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending noon Wednesday, 4th December 836 ships,including 156 allied and 17 neutral, were convoyed, and of these five are reported as having been lost.[21989] B
One battleship, two anti-aircraft ships, twelve armed merchant cruisers,forty-one destroyers and thirty-two sloops and corvettes were employed on escortduty. V   ;   1 - 1 -      &apos;      / &apos; ^&apos;;;V,r: -Since the start of the war, 198 ships have been lost in convoy, or one ship in 231.       -. . * &apos;- -     -    ^      - &apos;No convoys having arrived in Great Britain from overseas during theprevious week, arrivals during the week ending the 30th November includedseveral convoys which had been delayed, in addition to those normally expected.Imports to the United Kingdom and Ireland (including Eire) during these seven days were therefore abnormally large and totalled 1,526,696 tons, or nearly double the average of 868,050 for the ten weeks ending the 16th November. Forty-eighttankers brought 526,159 tons of oil; and mineral imports were 387,819 tons, ofwhich 256,886 tons were steel, pig iron, scrap iron and iron ore. Timber and pulpimports totalled 104,173 tons. Cereals amounted to 258,575 tons, twenty-three ships being fully laden with grain totalled 108,595 tons.British Minelaying.11. Surface minelaying operations have been confined to the French coast,fifty-four mines being laid off a northern French port and 280 off Ushant. Mine-laying by aircraft of the Bomber and Coastal Commands has been on a very small scale;  Mines were laid off the Flemish and French Atlantic coasts.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.12. During the night of the 2nd-3rd December, E-boats helped by lowvisibility avoided our M.T.B. patrols and laid a third minefield at the southernend of the Downs. Eight mines and two explosive cutters were found. shipping has been stopped temporarily until the Channel has been cleared.A channel has been cleared and established between Falmouth and Fowey,but both ports have been closed for over a week owing to acoustic or magnetic mines.Minelaying by enemy aircraft has not been so intense during this week.Most of the raids which have been thought to be minelaying have been over thesouth-western areas, including the Bristol Channel. The casualties to minesweepers, which have not been heavy this week, have been on the east coast, exceptone off Plymouth, and were probably caused by acoustic mines.Details of casualties are given in Appendix IV.Twelve acoustic and eleven magnetic mines have been exploded during theweek, and the totals now dealt with are, 86 acoustic, 810 magnetic and 747 contact.13. Mines are still being found from time to time on the Agulhas Bank, offthe Cape of Good Hope, in the field laid by a raider last May. Only a small part of the area has been examined, and ships have been instructed to avoidpassing over the Bank in less than 70 fathoms of water.Five more mines have been swept near Wilsons Promontory, Bass Straits,Australia. Two areas in this field have been cleared, but the area off Cape Otwayhas not yet been fully dealt with.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Germany.14. The Santos (5,943 tons) was torpedoed by a British M.T.B. at the mouth of the Scheldt during the night of the 30th November/1st December.The Klaus Schoke (5,848 tons), which had been in the Azores since theoutbreak of war, sailed from there on the 1st December. She was intercepted thefollowing night by H.M.S. California and scuttled by her crew.The Elsa Essberger (6,103 tons), speed 18 knots, and the tanker Winnetou(5,,113 tons) have left their moorings at Kobe. It is not known where they have gone.The master of a Greek ship has reported that on the 27th October the GermanBurgenland (7,320 tons), speed 13 knots, was being fitted with torpedo tubes andloading a large quantity of provisions at Kobe. There have been previous reportsthat this ship would be transferred to the Japanese.
Italian.15.   Nine Italian merchant ships are reported to have been sunk recently inthe Straits otOtranto, and among them are said to be the Antonietta Costa(5,900 tons),  Catalant (2 429 tons),  Numidia  (5,339 tons)  and  the  tankerSanandrea (5,077 tons).   The first of these sent out an S.O.S. on the 9th Octoberstating that she was being attacked by a submarine 45 miles West of Durazzo.British Contraband Control.16. During the month of November 4,875 tons of cargo intended for theenemy were seized in prize, the main items being 3,814 tons of food products andbeverages and 900 tons of oilseeds. The oilseeds and 3,526 tons of food productswere from French ships. The total seizures since the beginning of the war amountto 752,387 tons.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.17. The estimate of German forces on the Franco-Spanish border has not changed as a result of reports received during the last fortnight. Certainimprovements in communications have been noted, though these are mostly of along-term character and do not indicate any immediate German intention to moveforces into Spain.18. Reports of German troop concentrations on the Austrian-Yugoslavfrontier continue to be received. A further report states that certain arrange-ments have been made to move German troops by rail to points on the Hungarian-Yugoslav frontier. Other evidence confirms that German military preparationson Yugoslavia^ northern and N.E. frontiers are progressing methodically,19. It is now believed that German mountain troops have arrived in Italy.It is reported that they will be employed on the Albanian front. In thisconnection the reported presence in Italy of General Dietl and Colonel Ringel,both known to be mountain warfare experts, is of importance.The Balkan States.Greece and Albania.20. The Greek advance has continued over the whole front. In theNorthern sector the strategically important town of Pogradets has been captured1and considerable material has been taken. In the Pindus and northern Epirusthe advance has continued more slowly, though it has been steady in spite ofstubborn enemy opposition. In the coastal area Greek troops are now on the leftbank of the Bistrica river, some 4 miles south of Santi Quaranta (Sarande). It isexpected that the advance may now slow up owing to the maintenance difficulties.Bulgaria.21. The number of men under arms is thought to be 255,000. Some con-fusion has inevitably been caused by the simultaneous release of some and call-up of other reservists, but the net increase in numbers under arms is estimatedat 30,000. Of the 12 or 13 infantry divisions formed, not more than four arethought to be up to full strength.France.22. A recruiting campaign has been started for the small professional armythat is to replace the old conscript army.Volunteers are called for between thfe ages of eighteen and twenty-five years.Applicants must be unmarried, of French nationality and of an educationalstandard corresponding to primary school certificate.Middle East.Egypt.23.   There has been no further forward movement by the Italians.
Sudan.24. The fort at Gallabat was reoccupied by the enemy on the 29th November.In the Kassala sector, patrols of the S.D.F. have carried out raids and ambusheson troops and vehicles. In one instance the enemy fired on their own troops,inflicting a number of casualties.Crete. j -      &apos; &apos;         *   . &quot;25.   No. 50 Commando disembarked at Suda Bay on the 26th November.Far East.Indo-China.26. It is stated on good authority that the Japanese have withdrawn their claim for control of the customs at Saigon, and also that they have made no military or naval demands in South Indo-China. That there was some substance in the repeated Thai claims of native unrest in Indo-China is shown by a Frenchadmission that uprisings are now under control and 500 agitators in Cochin-China arrested.Thailand.27. The Thais llave denied the Vichy statement concerning the allegedbombing of Nakon Panom by the French on the 23rd November. Bombing raids were subsequently carried out by the Thais as a reprisal. A state of tension hasexisted on the frontier for some weeks and the military party is in full control inThailand, where insistent mass demonstrations have been held and intensepatriotism worked up: War has not, however, been declared. The Thais statethat they will confine themselves to bombing reprisals, but feeling is running highand frontier clashes between troops are likely.AIR SITUATION.General Review.\ 28. Our bombers have continued operations against military objectives in Germany and the occupied territories, though weather conditions have reduced their intensity and rendered extremely difficult the location of targets and theobservation of results.The scale of German operations over this country by day has increased, but is still about half that of September and October. By night, bomber operations were 50 per cent, greater than last week and were directed mainly againstindustrial centres. Diagrams showing the estimated scale of day and night operations over this country for the last three months are appended to this resume. . - ., . Objectives both in northern and southern Italy have been attacked. InAlbania our aircraft continue active co-operation with Greek forces and our fighters have scored some notable successes.Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent Raid Assess-ment Reports are given in Appendices V and VI.Germany and Occupied Territory.29. During the week 13 day and 241 night sorties were flown by bomber command, a considerable reduction compared to those of last week. weather conditions interfered greatly with operations, and only on three nights were more than twenty sorties made. Coastal Command flew twenty-eight night-bombing sorties during the week.. 30. Two concentrated attacks were made on the gas works, marshalling yards and an armament factory at Dusseldorf, on each occasion by more than twenty aircraft, and large fires were started in all the target areas. Similartargets at Mannheim were bombed by eleven aircraft. Oil targets were attacked on only one night, the 28th/29th November, when five aircraft bombed the synthetic oil plant at Politz, near Stettin, with very satisfactory results.31. Shipbuilding yards at Stettin, Wilhelmshaven and Bremen were also attacked, the latter by eleven heavy bombers. Channel ports and the naval bases at Brest and Lorient were attacked on each night of the week and bursts were
observed in the dock areas. Large fires were started at Lorient and, at Brest, hits were obtained on the power station, jetty, dry docks and barracks.Ten aircraft bombed the inland port and a railway target at Cologne andseventeen large and many small fires were seen burning after the attack. Similartargets at Ludwigshaven, Duisburg-Ruhrort and Mannheim were also locatedand bombed on a lighter scale. A successful attack was made on the Phillipselectrical factory at Eindhoven by two Coastal Command Blenheims, which obtained at least four direct hits.On the night of the 29th/30th November eight enemy bomber aerodromeswere attacked; at Lille bombs were seen to burst as an aircraft was landing. Assecondary targets, many anti-aircraft batteries, searchlights and factories havealso been bombed.32. Operations by day have been on a very small scale; of thirteen bomber command Blenheims despatched during the week to attack docks and oil targets in north-west Germany none were able to reach its objective. Coastal Com-mand aircraft, however, successfully bombed the Esbjerg Gas Works, where alarge fire broke out, a camp and quayside buildings near Kristiansand and a jettyon Feje Island, near Stavanger, where a very large fire and explosion were caused in a munition dump. Four aerodromes in Northern France were also attacked,with indefinite results, except at St. Brieuc, where a hangar was hit.Great Britain.33. Fighter Command flew 626 patrols, involving 2,543 sorties, by day, an^78 sorties by night. These figures show a slight reduction by day and a con-siderable one by night, weather conditions having been unsuitable for night inter-exceptions on four of the nights during the period under review.34. The increased enemy activity by day has not resulted in any seriousattacks, most of the aircraft employed having been fighters, or fighter-bombers,which confined their operations to sweeps at high altitudes over the south-eastern and southern counties; on three days a few isolated aircraft penetrated theLondon area. Towards the end of the week the weather became unsuitable forday operations and there was no activity except from reconnaissance aircraft.Our fighters had a successful day on the 29th November, when they shot downfour bombers without loss; three of these were&quot;attacking the disabled destroyerII.M.S. Javelin off the Lizard, and the fourth was spotting for the long-rangeChannel guns. During the week twenty-five enemy aircraft were destroyed by our fighters in daylight operations, with the loss of eighteen aircraft and eight pilots..35. On the night of the 30th November-lst December a heavy attack was concentrated on Southampton, followed by a lighter attack on the following night,and on the 2nd-3rd December the Bristol area was heavily attacked. Duringtwo other nights less concentrated attacks were focussed on the Midlands, and,during a third, on the South London suburbs, though bombing also took placein other widely separated areas. Early in the week Liverpool was attacked, andraids were plotted as far north as the Solway Firth.Coastal.36. Coastal Command has maintained routine, special and offensive patrols and reconnaissances, and has flown 200 patrols involving 338 sorties, including,the operations already mentioned. The reduction compared to last week&apos;s opera-tions was due to adverse weather conditions. Convoy work has increased and132 escorts were provided. Weather has also interfered with minelaying and only nine aircraft were employed during the week.37. Attacks on enemy shipping b,ave again been frequent, both by torpedoand bomb, and, though many were unsuccessful or unobserved, two merchant ships were successfully bombed off Norway and another, of 8,000 tons, was left sinkingafter a torpedo attack by a Beaufort off Holland. As already reported, a Lerwick%ing-boat secured a direct hit on a submarine on the 2nd December. On thefollowing day a similar aircraft engaged a four-engined Focke-Wulf bomberwhich was attacking a convoy 130 miles north-west of Bloody Foreland, but theenemy escaped into the clouds.[21989] c
38. Minelaying. by the enemy has been continued on about the same scaleas last week, 125 aircraft being engaged. Enemy air reconnaissance has been maintained on the usual lines, and the long-range unit from Bordeaux hascontinued to make reconnaissances and attacks on shipping in the WesternAtlantic.Italy, Greece and Malta.39. Further successful attacks on objectives in Italy have been carriedout by aircraft operating from this country and from Malta. On the night of the 28th/29th November six Wellingtons from Malta delivered a successful attack on quays, fuel tanks and the station at Brindisi, and on the, 2nd/3rdDecember an attack by four similar aircraft on the oil refinery at Naples causedwide-spread fires. On the same night damage was caused, and at least one aircraft destroyed, at the aerodromes at Catania and Augusta in Sicily. On the night ofthe 4th/5th December nine Wellingtons, operating from this country, bombed the Royal Arsenal at Turin, and caused many explosions and persistent fires.On the same night three single aircraft attacked the Fiat aero-engine works and blast furnaces and a ball-bearing factory in the same town, starting fires at each.40. In spite of very bad weather conditions the scale of Royal Air Forceattacks against Italian bases in Albania has been increased. Valona, Durazzoand Sarande, the Italian base ports, have been frequently bombed; special attention has also been paid to the supply and communication centres at Tepelene,Argyrocastro and Elbasan. At Valona persistent fighter opposition was encountered, and one enemy fighter was probably shot clown. On the 4th DecemberBlenheims secured two direct hits on a destroyer which was shelling the Greek forces from Sarande.41. On the 28th November a Gladiator patrol shot down seven out of twentyItalian fighters with the loss of only one of our aircraft by a collision in which an eighth Italian fighter was destroyed. Three Italian reconnaissance aircraft were shot down on the 3rd December. On the following day Gladiators providedfighter patrols for our bombers and for the Greek Air Force. During these operations eight enemy fighters were destroyed and probably a number of others.All our fighters returned safely, though three were damaged.Italian aircraft have attacked Greek advanced bases, but little damageappears to have been effected.  Concentrated attacks have been made on Corfu.42. Attacks on Malta during the week have not been pressed home, thoughhostile formations have approached the island on several occasions. Only on the27th and 28th November were any attacks made, and during these our fighters shot down three enemy aircraft.Egypt and Libya.43. Operations during this week have been on a reduced scale. , Italian bases and aerodromes along the Cirenaican coast have been attacked, but no outstanding-results have been reported. On the 1st December two Blenheims attacked the aerodrome at Benina, destroying at least two aircraft and damaging two others.Hurricanes attacked an enemy column on the 28th November near Sidi Barrani,killing the crew of a pom-pom battery and damaging transport vehicles. Italianair activity has been negligible.Sudan and East Africa.44. Bombing attacks have been maintained on aerodromes, petrol dumpsand other military targets in Eritrea, and a number of low-flying attacks havebeen made on troop concentrations and camps on the Sudan frontier, notably atMetemma, Gubba and Kassala. Aircraft of the South African Air Force have carried out valuable offensive reconnaissances over Southern Abyssinia. aircraft from Aden have maintained fighter patrols and convoy escorts in the Red Seaarea, and punitive bombing of the Quteibis has been continued.
Air Intelligence.Italy.45. A new Italian fighter, believed to be the Caproni R.E. 2000, with a.German Daimler-Benz engine, has been encountered off Sicily. This aircraftresembles the Hurricane and its top speed may be similar, though it is believed to be considerably less powerfully armed.46. All engines in existing Italian fighters are reported to have been boostedand in some cases the gun-power has been increased. In spite of these improve-ments, Italian pilots are said to be very dissatisfied with the results of theircombats with Hurricanes.47. The latest reports confirm the impression that Italian pilots lack night-flying training and experience considerable difficulty in carrying out night -bombing operations.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.48.   The extent of enemy air activity is summarised under Air Situation.The most noticeable feature of the- week has been a serious nightly raid on some important city; Liverpool, London, Southampton (on two consecutive nights),Bristol and Birmingham (on two consecutive nights but not so intense as lastweek). Little damage of military importance has been caused. Except for the night 28th/29th November the raids were over by midnight or soon after.Summary of Air Raids.By Day.49. The week has been uneventful. On the 2nd December in particular, nobombs were dropped anywhere in the country.By Night.50. 28th/29th November. A short but heavy raid took place on liverpool and neighbouring districts. A direct hit on a shelter at Durning Street killed164people. Forty other places in Lancashire and Cheshire were attacked, among them Chester and Manchester. Seventeen parachute mines were dropped in otherparts of the countiy, mostly in the South and South-West.51. 29th/30th November. There was a heavy raid on London but this was of short duration and confined to the outskirts. The Southern Railway was damaged at a number of points. The Home Counties shared extensively in the raid.52. On the two succeeding nights attacks were delivered on Southampton.On the first night a great deal of damage was done by fire, and civil defence services were hampered by the destruction of the telephone exchange and reserveexchanges. About two-thirds of the main shopping centre was destroyed. On thesecond night the fire situation was rendered more grave by the shortage of water and losses of equipment, but after 0300 the situation eased. Damage to indusrty was not extensive and casualties on either night were not proportionately high.53. 2nd/3rd December. Bristol suffered the most widespread raid it has yet had. Damage was clone to the G.W.R. system but was mainly confined to public buildings and private property, though some production was lost in theaircraft and other industries from damage to public utility services.54. 3rd/4th December. There was a short sharp attack on Birmingham anda relatively heavy random attack on London. Most of the damage in Birminghamwas on small houses and shops, but there was some industrial and railwaydamage and the Birmingham-Worcester Canal was breached. In London adirect hit on a shelter in Hammersmith killed 10 persons and injured 50.55. 4th/5th December. Raids were repeated on Birmingham and London,but they apparently miscarried and a proportion of bombs were dropped inMidland, Southern and Home Counties.
Damage.Service Property.56. The Naval Stores at Southampton were badly damaged. The Navalbarrack and dockyard at Chatham and the Naval School at Heston were hit.A military store at Hounslow and a balloon at Wandsworth were destroyed.Public Utilities.Liverpool.57. At Alfred Street Gas Works repairs will take some months. AtBanks Road Works an unexploded mine held up production, and Garston dockwas immobilised. This mine has been dealt with, and the effect on productionof the damage at Alfred Street is insignificant owing to alternative supplies.Southampton.58. The water shortage, now improving, caused considerable anxiety. Gasservices will only be partially restored in two weeks, meanwhile the effect on production is serious.Bristol.59. Many electric feeders were hit and the supply to three districts cut off.Between 30 and 40 gas mains were hit. The water situation, which had beenvery serious after the previous week&apos;s raid, was greatly improving, but has beenslightly put back by this week&apos;s raid.Birmingham.60. By the 3rd December services were almost back to normal, but the raidthat night set the Adderley Street Gas Works on fire.Industry.61.   The following key points suffered serious damage : &apos;(a) Southampton.G.E.C., Ltd. (Pirelli General Gables Works, Ltd.).Harland and Woolf, Ltd., Extension Yard.Solent Flour Mills, Joseph Rank, Ltd., badly damaged.(b) Birmingham.Progress had been made with restoration of factories, and first aid to roofs and walls enabled production in many cases to be resumed. Inother cases plant had been salvaged and set up elsewhere. 14 key points were again hit in this week&apos;s raids, but the only serious new damagereported is at Fisher and Ludlow&apos;s Works at Rea Street (pressing andstamps).(c) London.P. B. Cow, Ltd., Streatham (balloons), production reduced 50 percent, for at least a week.Rail.62. Although services were dislocated at Southampton, Bristol and birmingham, the damage sustained was not critical.Civil Defence.63. In London the A.F.S. centre at Wandsworth and the Battersea FireStation were damaged; also an A.R.P. stores at Erith, where vehicles were destroyed. Outside London two police stations and a police school were hit in birmingham, an A.F.S. station at Plymouth and a wardens&apos; post at Birmingham.Other Buildings.64. In London the Civil Centre at Dagenham and Richmond Town Hallwere seriously damaged; at Chester the south aisle choir stalls and much stained
glass in the Cathedral; at Southampton the Ordnance Survey Office; at Bristolthe Bishop&apos;s Palace, the University, the Boy Scouts&apos; Headquarters, anUnemployed Welfare Centre and several Churches; and the following hospitals :Barrowmere Tuberculosis Hospital, Cheshire; The Bristol Children&apos;s Hospital;the South-Western Hospital, Lambeth; West Middlesex Hospital; Queen Mary&apos;hospital, Wandsworth; The South Hampshire Hospital and St. Mary&apos;sInstitution, Southampton.Civilian Casualties.65. For the week ending 0600 on the 4th December the approximate figures are 775 killed and 1,657 seriously injured against the previous week&apos;s total of696 killed and 1,009 seriously injured.   They include the following :  SeriouslyKilled. Injured.London (total for week)     ......... 277 596Includes 131 killed and 267 seriously injured on 29th/30th November.Liverpool (28th/29th November)...... - 264 62Southampton (30th November/1st Decem-ber)       ...      ......      ...... 70 120Southampton (lst/2nd December)...... 40 100Bristol (2nd /3rd December)       ...... 31 131Birmingham (3rd/4th December) ...       ... 25 60Unexploded Bombs.66. On the evening of the 2nd December the total was 2,772. Additions inthe week were 590, but 811 were disposed of. Only 6 in. Category A are left onthe latest return.Civil Defence Operations and Morale.67.
