Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1941.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (41) 5.January 7, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to&quot;ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ATTITUDE OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT TOWARDS THEEMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE AND THE POSITION OF italian east AFRICA IN THE EVENT OF AN ENEMY DEFEAT.GENERAL WAVELL has asked for guidance on the terms we might offer the Italians in Italian East Africa. If these were reasonable the Italians might at a later stage.be inclined to give up the campaign and we should then, of course,be able to release our forces in that theatre for duty elsewhere. The territories in question are :-(i) Abyssinia.(ii) Eritrea.(iii) Italian Somaliland.2. When on the 18th June last the Cabinet agreed to facilitate the return of the Emperor Haile Selassie to Africa in the belief that he would play a usefulpart as the centre-piece of an Abyssinian revolt against the Italians, it wasdecided that this action would not commit His Majesty&apos;s Government to put the Emperor back on the throne on the liberation of Ethiopia from the Italianyoke. As a result of this caution, which was based on the possibility thatHaile Selassie might not be acceptable either to the Amhara chieftains alreadyactive against the enemy or to such important tribal minorities as the Galla ofthe Western provinces, no definite undertaking has been given to replace himon the throne. Since June, however, not only has the Emperor successfullyestablished contact with various guerilla chieftains of importance, but it hasbecome apparent that the alleged Galla hostility towards him has beenexaggerated. Moreover, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle Eastand the Sudan,, and other authorities concerned with the fomenting of anti-Italianactivity in Abyssinia, are of the opinion that the Emperor&apos;s leadership is likelyto be a vital factor in the success of the movement now rapidly spreading. It is submitted, therefore, that the time has come for His Majesty&apos;s Government to admit Haile Selassie&apos;s claim to the throne and pledge him their support inregaining it.3. It necessarily follows from the foregoing that His Majesty ^Governmentenvisage, on the defeat of Italy, the reappearance of Ethiopia as an independent state. We are, in fact, committed to an independent Ethiopia, subject to certainfrontier rectifications and the delimitation of the border between Ethiopia andSomaliland, through a variety of official pronouncements in Parliament. At thesame time, there can hardly be question of the simple restoration of the status quo ante 1935, when Ethiopia existed uneasily in what was nothing less than adeplorable state of savagery. His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, look forward to the creation of a native State which for many years will need some form ofinternational guidance in political and economic affairs. This, however, is. notto imply that the emergence of such a State would constitute any military commit-ment for this country.   Public opinion in the United Kingdom would in allMemorandttm by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.11256   [22100]
probability react as strongly against anything of the kind as it would againstthe acquisition of any substantial part of Abyssinian territory, whether cloakedas a protectorate over the Gallas of the Western proyinces or not./ HisMajesty&apos;s Government have declared with emphasis more than once that they haveno territorial ambitions in Abyssinia. It is known that the Emperor HaileSelassie recognises the need for outside assistance in the gradual modernisation of his country, and would be prepared to co-operate in securing it, and, havingsecured it, to negotiate on such subjects as needed frontier rectifications, theextinction of slavery, the protection of tribal minorities from Amhara despotismand kindred matters.4. Eritrea. This territory, which is inhabited by backward and warlikenatives closely akin in race and customs to the Abyssinians, has been in Italianpossession for the past 60 years, the first Italian force having landed in 1879and the first commercial treaties with Menelik and other local chieftains being negotiated in 1863. It is undeniable that during this period the country and its people have benefited from Italian rule. There is no national feeling among theEritreans which would justify an independent Eritrea, and, on the assumptionthat the Chiefs of Staff would see no objection, it is suggested that Eritreashould remain permanently in Italian hands. Meanwhile, the colony should beultilised, if necessity arises, as a place of disposal, after being disarmed, of enemy troops abandoning Abyssinia.5. So far as the Somalilands are concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed to not interfering with French Somaliland. They are also committed to the eventual re-occupation of British Somaliland on the defeat of the Italians.It would probably be also necessary, moreover, to satisfy public opinion that weshould at any rate during the war reoccupy Jubaland, which was ceded by GreatBritain to Italy in 1925. But while the existing frontiers of French Somalilandmay be regarded as stable and as not raising any acute ethnological difficulties,this does not hold good of British Somaliland, as it is inhabited by migratorytribes, whose claims to have access to watering and grazing areas in regionsonce in dispute between Abyssinia and Italy, and lately fully occupied by theenemy, were frequently a cause of argument with Rome. In any eventual settle-ment of the problems of North-East Africa extensive frontier rectifications anddemarcations will therefore be necessary, and these will especially affect Britishand Italian Somaliland. The nature of any such ultimate settlement cannot before seen with any certainty at the present time. And it is, therefore, recommendedthat the only decision required at the moment is that, if or when the Italiancollapse occurs, enemy troops should, as in the case of Eritrea, be allowed toreturn to and assemble in Italian Somaliland (exclusive of Jubaland), there tobe disarmed. To achieve this; and to maintain local order at a time when thenative population is likely to he in a state of possibly dangerous effervescence, itis necessary to envisage the military occupation of certain key points and ports,notably Kismayu in Jubaland.Conclusions.It is suggested, therefore, that General Wavell should be told :  (a) That His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to admit Haile Selassie&apos;claim to the throne of Ethiopia, but that a recreated Abyssinia willrequire international guidance in political and economic affairs; HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be ready to help the Emperor, if so desired, to obtain such assistance, but any suggestion that the UnitedKingdom might accept any military commitment towards a restoredAbyssinia must be avoided. Minor frontier rectifications will also benecessary, as will the delimitation of the frontier with Somaliland.(5) It is our intention to return Eritrea to the Italians under the final peace,and meanwhile any armistice which may be concluded in Italian EastAfrica would permit the Italians to retain this territory.. (c) The ultimate disposal of the three Somalilands will require further consideration, but meanwhile w-e should be prepared, under the terms -ofan armistice in Italian East Africa, to return Italian Somaliland tothe Italians, subject to our right to occupy key positions. We shouldreoccupv British Somaliland and presumably also Jubaland.- - -       &apos;  :.- - &quot; . - &quot;     &apos;;    f &apos;     - - - &apos;..&apos; A. E.Foreign Office.
