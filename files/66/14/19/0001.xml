(40) 427.):     Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.PRODUCING aircraft in existing conditions is a very difficult task. Andlately our troubles have increased.The general and cumulative effect of bombing is making itself felt in our production lines.   They are becoming very thin., We are also having difficulties about machine tools. These do not springfrom the actual damage done to the tools. On the contrary, it has been foundthat the machine tool stands up to the blast of the bomb remarkably well.In the attack on Coventry, where 50,000 machine tools were concentrated,only 700 were destroyed. In Birmingham, where as many as 70,000 wereassembled, 700 were destroyed. , ,But while the machine tools in our possession might give very good resultswhen the men worked them by night as well as by day, it is now very hard to persuade staffs in some centres to do night duty.The general effect has been to cut down the proportion of men employed onnight work.   In many directions night shifts have been abandoned.So far, however, production has been satisfactory in the circumstances,although further declines in output must be faced.In January 1940 the Air Ministry laid down a provisioning programme. Itis against this programme that our labours must be judged.The situation over the first 10 months of the year is as follows : &quot;Actual output compared with January 1940 programme.January to May to april 1940.

During August, September and,. October most of the great factories were bombed, and in some of them production was seriously damaged.%&apos; As a result of the maintenance of a satisfactory level of production throug-hthe months of bombing, we have been able to add substantially to the sfciwia+iithe Royal Air Force.     :    . &quot;   ,        \    gtn other   is the strength of the Metropolitan Air Force at the 10th May, 1940andi.the 13th December, 1940, in the six mam operational types, Hurricane&apos;Spitfire, Whitley, Wellington, Hampden and Blenheim : May 10.

With them went 3,092 engines.The position in relation to spares is satisfactory. There is a marked improvement oh conditions when the Churchill Government was formed..&apos;!&apos;,)&apos;.

Therefore no prospect of improvement.The process of Dispersal is being conducted with energy and on a very large scale. Plants, machine tools and man-power have been distributed over wide areas of Britain. The problems of requisitioning, of transport and of billetinghave been immense.&apos;r,Vinkers-Armstrong, Chester, has been dispersed to 24 places.Westland, Yeovil, to 29 places.Supermartne, Southampton, to 34 places.Vickers-Armstrong, Weybridge, to 37 places.All this has meant much interference with our output.And here is a word of warning.Magneto capacity at present damages and soon may cripple engine production.Over one-half of all magnetos were produced by British Thomson-Houston.This wqrks, at Coventry, was damaged by bombs. Much labour disappeared and could nbt be attracted to Coventry again.The. balance of Magneto production is in the keeping of Rotax and Simms.Rotax has been dispersed.  Simms is too small and nothing need be done.Many Cheetah engines await magnetos. Oxford aircraft are unserviceableon that account. &apos;It is deeply regretted that British Thomson-Houston was not dispersed beforethe attack on Coventry. i! ;Other great dispersal projects await decision.  -It is my hope that the Cabinet will consider the policy of dispersal and takestrong measures to support the plans of this Ministry., ...   ..........        ......, ., B.Ministry of Aircraft Production, &apos; ..... *December 24, 1940. &apos; &apos;!
IN this review of our labours in aircraft production in Britain it is necessaryto give a warning that we are required at present to rely on our own resources;; west cannot depend on any very large measure of assistance from the United:States in/the immediate future. ,It is true that we have had a fine success in ferrying aircraft over the!Atlantic up to this moment.   We can claim to have sustained no losses. ;Below I set out an account of delays in the delivery of aircraft under contractin the United States.It is a most alarming document.Delays in the Delivery of American Aircraft.Dive Bombers Brewster Ordered   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      - - -      750Promised deliveries January 1941       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      ...        35Continuing at a rate of, per month     ...      ...      ...        50The present estimate is first deliveries in July 1941. \\Vultee- Ordered   .....................      ...      600Promised deliveries May to August 1941       ...............        66September to October 1941       ............      108Continuing at a rate of, per month     ...      ...      ...        75Delivery dates now uncertain.Support Bombers Glenn Martins 187&apos;s (Baltimore)- Ordered..................      ......      800Promised deliveries April to July 1941............      ...      ...      152Continuing at the rate of, per month   ...       ......        50Delays will occur.Fighter Brewster Buffalo Ordered............       ...       ...       ... 170Promised deliveries By end of November       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        75In December        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ..,        47None shipped.Flying Boats  .        &apos;,P.B.Y. 5&apos;s-Ordered.........      ...............      149Promised deliveries September to February       ...      ...        19None received.Bombers Consolidated B. 24 Ordered........................      301Promised deliveries From November 1940 to April 1941     ......      ...        11None received.Hudson UI Ordered  ...      .........      ......      .......     428Promised deliveries October to December       ...      ...      ..:      ...      ...      153i i     Received     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        21Ministry of Aircraft Production,December 24, 1940.
