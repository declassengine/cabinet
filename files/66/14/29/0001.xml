SECRET.W.P. (41) 6(Also Paper No. G.O.S. (41) 25)January 9, 1941TQ BE KEPT UMBER LOCK AMP KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 71)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon January 2nd, to12 noon January 9th,1941[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Copy No.    ^8
naval SITUATION.General Review.There has been considerable naval activity in the Mediterranean, where thefleet co-operated in the capture of Bardia and has been occupied in the support and supply of our land forces.Shipping losses are considerably below the average and enemy minelayinghas been slight.   A German 8-inch cruiser has docked at Brest.Home Waters.2. During the period strong units of the Home Fleet have been coveringconvoys and acting in support of minelaying operations.On the 3rd and 4th January H.M. Destroyers Kelvin and Kipling searchedthe northern part of the Bay of Biscay for an enemy tanker and Italian U-boatwhich had been reported by aircraft, but sighted nothing. Another unproductivesearch for a merchant ship reported off Gris Nez was made by two destroyers onthe night of the 6th/7th January.H.M. Sloop Lowestoft was mined in the Thames Estuary on the 5th january and towed into harbour; two of her crew were wounded.H.M. Destroyers Mashona and Sikh were in collision on the 6th January and both were considerably damaged.Mediterranean.3. H.M.S. Terror carried out a bombardment of Bardia with the assistanceof naval aircraft on the evening of the 2nd January as a prelude to the assault.On the 3rd January H.M. Ships Warspite, Valiant, Bar ham, Illustrious and10 destroyers carried out a concentrated attack on enemy support troops, tanks,motor transport and coastal defences. Bombardment had to cease after 1600owing to the position of our troops. Several ineffective air attacks were madeon the Fleet and the only casualties were in H.M.S. Aphis, which had a fewwounded by a near bomb miss.Prior to the capture, the enemy ran 200-300 ton motor schooners from Bardiato Tobruk by night, some of which were intercepted by our Destroyers. One ofthese was sunk by Waterhen on the 26th December; Voyager captured anotheron the 29th, which had eight British prisoners of war on board; and Daintycaptured two more on the 31st.4. H.M. Ships Terror, Aphis and Ladybird, and H.M. Australiandestroyers covered the passage of supply ships from Alexandria to Sollum duringthe latter part of December. Over 3,000 tons of water was pumped ashore forthe Army, and 18,000 prisoners were evacuated from Mersa Matruh. The watersituation was critical until the 23rd December, when water-barges, which hadbeen weather-bound at Mersa Matruh, arrived in the Gulf of Sollum. Until thenH.M.S. Protector landed water, and gun-boats pumped water ashore from.M. Ships Terror, Fiona, Chakla and petrol carrier Petronella, which was justsufficient to keep the Army supplied. After the 23rd storage ashore was increased and the situation improved. Whilst the Army can provide stores, &amp;c, by road,additional supplies by sea have been and still remain essential.Torpedo bombers made several unsuccessful attacks on our ships at Sollumat dawn and dusk.   One torpedo bomber is believed to have been shot down.East Africa.5. H.M.S. Chantala (Armed Boarding vessel) bombarded Bulhar (british somali land) on the morning of the 4th January and demolished the Residentshouse.   She was attacked by aircraft but suffered no damage.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. On the 6th January a Sunderland aircraft depth-charged a submarine200 miles west of the Butt of Lewis with the result that a large piece of metal was
blown into the air and a large oil patch appeared. Two other attacks were madeby aircraft, one off the Bloody Foreland and one in the Bay of Biscay, but inneither case was there any visible result.A promising attack on a U-boat was made by H.M. Corvette Anemone andthe Free French Corvette La Malouine in the Western Approaches on the7th January.Reports have also been received of a promising attack carried out by theA/S trawler Jade off Malta on the 29th December.Enemy Intelligence.German.7. There has been little evidence of the positions of German surface units,except for the location of a Hipper Class cruiser in dry dock at Brest on the3rd January. It is believed that this is the cruiser which Avas engaged byH.M. Ships Berwick and Bonaventure on the 25th December. Several air attacks have been made on this ship, and she is thought to have been hit at least once;details of the attacks will be found in the Air Section of this resume. during these attacks two destroyers were also reported to have been damaged.It is believed that the Germans have fifteen destroyers now available, ofwhich up to the 4th January the following have been located. Four at Kiel, 1 at hamburg, 2 at Wilhelmshaven, 6 at Bremen (4 apparently fitting out) and 1at Brest.Italian.8. Air reconnaissances covered most of the Italian ports in the course of theweek. At Naples (on 6th J anuary) there were two battleships, one cruiser in dry dock, and three destroyers; at Cagliari (on 8th January) two destroyers and eightseaplanes; at Trapani (on 8th January) four destroyers; at Messina (on 8th January) three cruisers and three destroyers; at Taranto (on 8th January)four cruisers and two destroyers; and at Tripoli (on 6th January) five or six destroyers. In the Red Sea an air reconnaissance over Massawa showed three submarines and four destroyers. The remaining Italian battleships, which are believed to be at Spezia and Taranto, were not observed in the period except forone damaged Cavour in the outer harbour of Taranto.V-Boats.9. Throughout the week there have been three to four German U-boats inthe North-West Approaches, and the same number of Italians. The Germansseem to have been concentrated in the northern part of the area rather further tothe eastward than hitherto. One German U-boat has been maintained in theFreetown-Cape Verde area, and one Italian in the Azores-Madeira-Canariesarea. At the latter end of the period evidence was extremely scarce, but it ispossible that reliefs may be on their way north-about from Germany to the North-Western Approaches.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.Note. The following figures give the losses which have been reported during the period the 2nd to the 8th January. They should not be confusedwith the figures shown for the last week in the diagrams of shipping lossesattached at the back of the Resume, which show the actual losses for eachcomplete week since the outbreak of war, and are only made up to midnightof Sunday-Monday of the week immediately preceding that covered, by this resume. Later figures are not included in the diagrams, as they are likelyto be unreliable, owing to delayed notifications and uncertainty regarding theresult of recent attacks.10. Eight ships and two small craft, a total of 41,908 tons, are reported lost by enemy action; of these, all but two ships (12,564 tons) were British. only four of these ships were sunk during the period under review.Two ships (10,994 tons) were sunk by Italian U-boats, one off the Cape VerdeIslands and one in the North-Western Approaches. The former, the british.S. Shake spear, appears to have fought a gallant action with the U-boat for.two hours until her gun was put out of action. Three ships and two small craft[22106] b
Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.14. During the week four German merchant ships have been seriously damaged or sunk at sea by our aircraft, three off the coast of Norway, and one,a tanker, off the Hook of Holland. - :(9,899 tons) were mined, the majority being sunk in the Thames Estuary.Two ships (14,274 tons) were sunk by raider, one in the Indian Ocean inOctober and one off Freetown in December. One ship (6,941 tons) previously reported damaged by air attack is now a total loss.In addition, eight ships and 3 small craft are reported damaged; with twoexceptions these casualties occurred during an air attack on the ports in whichthe ships were lying.   Convoys were unsuccessfully attacked by enemy aircraft in the Thames Estuary and in the North-Western Approaches on the 5th JanuaryDetails of shipping losses are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ended noon Wednesday,. the 8th January, 663 ships,including 128 allied and 22 neutral, were convoyed, of these 2 were lost by enemy action.One battleship, one A/A cruiser, 9 armed merchant cruisers, 20 destroyers and 37 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the4th January totalled 636,082 tons, compared with 627,360 tons during the weekbefore, and an average of 750,197 during the previous ten weeks.Oil imports, in twelve tankers, were 115,862 tons compared with 138,985 tons during the week ending the 28th December. Mineral imports were 143,658 tons,of which 100,550 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Thecorresponding figures for the previous week were 166,551 tons and 112,844 tons.Timber imports were 60,619 tons and cereals imports were 149,207 tons, elevenships being fully laden with grain. Other food imports were 114,677 tons, ofwhich 57,698 tons were sugar and molasses, 8,747 tons were meat and 5,591 tons were tea. Imports of eggs totalling 7,995 tons included a full cargo of 6,747 tonsof. refrigerated eggs from North China. There were large quantities of aeroplanes, machine tools and munitions from Canada and the United States.British Minelaying.12. During the week H.M.S. Adventure laid 1,000 mines in the St. George&apos;s channel area; the 1st Minelaying Squadron laid over 2,000 in the vicinity of the faroes; H.M. Destroyers Icarus and Intrepid laid 108 off the Norwegian coast;and H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 270 in the East&apos;Coast Barrier.In addition M.T.B.&apos;s have laid mines off the French Coast, and minelayingby aircraft has been continued on a somewhat increased scale in the WesternBaltic, off the North-Western coast of Germany, and the Channel and Atlanticcoasts of France.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. Fog and wintry conditions have again reduced the activities of enemyminelaying aircraft.There have been six casualties this week, including a destroyer which reachedharbour.  Four of the ships sank.During sweeping operations mines have been detonated off the Humber,Penzance Bay, Bristol Channel, Liverpool and Loch Ewe; the last named isthought to have been one of the original lay of November 1939.The totals of mines now accounted for are : 844 magnetic, 775 contact and 119 acoustic.On the 4th January a mine was exploded by sweeping craft 40 miles south-east of Hobart, Tasmania. A dangerous area was at once declared and a channelhas now been established.
5172The whale factory ship Jan Wellem,., 11,776 tons, and the JApye, 7,849 tons,which were sunk at Narvik last April, are reported to have been salved and tohave recently left that port.As the result of an aerial reconnaissance of Cherbourg, which was made onthe 29th December, the tanker Brake, 9,925 tons, was identified. She had leftVigo, where she had taken refuge at the outbreak of war, on the 11th December,and had been reported from Ferrol the following day.The latest report on ice conditions in Scandinavia up to the 7th Januaryo-ives the northern Swedish and Finnish ports in the Gulf of Bothnia as closedwith thick ice, though Hernosand and the southern ports are being kept open byicebreakers. In Denmark all the large fiords are frozen up and no longernavigable. The Danish press says that their icebreakers are out of action forwant of coal.Italian.15. War materials are being carried by small Italian and Yugoslav ships,mostly auxiliary sailing ships, the main route being from Trieste to San Giovannidi Medua, on the coast south of Scutari.Four dhows, which had sailed from Dahlak. Island, were intercepted in theEed Sea by one of H.M. Ships as they were suspected of trading with italian east Africa.Aircraft Casualties from Naval Gunfire.16. From the start of the war until the 31st December, 1940, 193 enemy aircraft were certainly and 91 probably destroyed, and 105 were damaged. Themajority of these casualties were inflicted by LT.M. Ships, but naval-manned A.A.guns ashore destroyed 14, and D.E.M.S. and fishing vessels certainly destroyed17, with a further 10 probable and 24 damaged. Dutch, Norwegian and Polishwarships accounted for 11 certain, 2 probable and 7 damaged.British Contraband Control.17. During the month of December 2,483 tons of cargo destined for theenemy were seized in prize.- The main items were 1,442 tons of food products and beverages, which were mostly from French and Portuguese ships, 590 tonsof chemical and allied products, almost entirely from Japanese ships, and 372 tonsof non-metallic minerals from United States, French and Swedish ships.MILITARY SITUATION.The Balkan States.A albania.18. The exceptionally severe winter, making movement difficult andaggravating the already serious problem of supplies, coupled with the steadyflow of Italian reinforcements, has for the time being brought the Greek advancealmost to a standstill. The Greeks, however, continue to hold the initiative, have successfully repelled local counter-attacks, have gained ground at various points,and taken a number of prisoners and valuable war material.The total number of Italian divisions in Albania is now 19.Hungary.19. The rumour broadcast by the B.B.C. on the 30th December last regardingthe mobilisation of the Hungarian army is officially stated to be completelyuntrue, the only increase in effectives being that due to the normal intake of recruits for training.20. The report that a German Military Mission was being sent to Hungaryto reorganise the Hungarian army on the lines of the Roumanian army iscategorically denied in Hungarian military circles. It is believed that the German
General Staff has been trying to negotiate for the despatch of a mission of thiskind for some time; the Hungarians have refused as they realise that the arrival of such a mission would probably mean the loss of the last vestiges of independence that they still possess..Roumania.21. Further reports have been received indicating that German reinforce-ment continues, especially in the Arad-Temesvar area. According to a reportof the 5th January, it is the German intention to concentrate twelve divisions,including motorised divisions, between the Roumanian frontier and the lineOradea-Alba Julia-Turna Severin. There are further reliable indications thatthe total number of troops to be. concentrated on the Bulgarian and Yugoslavborders may eventually amount to 120 divisions,   p22. Thus the threat to Yugoslavia and /or Bulgaria continues, and an attackon the latter might be undertaken as a preliminary operation. At the same timeweather conditions in the Balkans make large-scale winter operations verydifficult, and the present rate of preparation for such operations suggests thatthe final stage of readiness will not be reached before the end of February. Itmust be emphasised that Germany may consider herself forced by circumstances to act before, in which case she may launch her attack in time to complete hercampaign before the snow starts to melt in the latter half of February.Yugoslavia.23. The winter strength of the Yugoslav army is now confirmed at about500,000. Regular formations on the German, Hungarian, Roumanian andBulgarian frontiers are to remain reinforced. Reserve divisions have all beendemobilised.Bulgaria.24. Information tends to show that the problem of railway goods-wagons isparticularly acute in Bulgaria, and that about 50 per cent, of the wagons requirerepair.25. Heavy rain has fallen in Sofia, and the thaw extends to. 4,000 feet.Press reports of floods in the S.E. are unconfirmed, but main roads would in anycase soon become impracticable if used continuously by mechanical traffic. Earlyin the week the Danube was reported to be frozen.Africa.Libya.26. Bardia has been captured by the British forces, the number of prisonerstaken being estimated at 32,000, including 1,200 wounded. British and Australianwounded are under 600. As soon as they could be released from the operationsaround Bardia our armoured troops advanced towards Tobruk and forwardelements are now west of that town. No detailed information is yet availableregarding captured equipment. It is. reported that three prominent BlackshirtCommanders made good their escape from Bardia by air or sea, probably duringthe night the 4th/5th January, deserting their troops and leaving regularCommanders to fight on.27. Serious deterioration of morale, which has never been high, appearsto have contributed to the Italian defeat.28. It is not yet known whether any reinforcements are being sent to Libyato replace the considerable wastage in man power suffered by Marshal Graziani.Without these it is difficult to see where the Italians can hope to make a stand,as the utilisation of their remaining resources in Libya would deplete the garrison of Tripolitania.Sudan.29.   Our artillery and patrol activity continues.
East Africa.30. In the Northern Sector our irregular companies have reached thefrontier between the Huri Hills (110 miles S.S.W. of Lake Stefanie) and Dukana(60 miles further north). One of our patrols from Garissa returned with threeCaproni engines which they had salvaged from a plane shot down on the22nd November.A byssitiia.31. The Italians, holding the territories of certain friendly chiefs, aremanaging to maintain their communications, though uncertain of their ownnative troops.32. Abyssinian patriots control most of the country away from the roads and garrisons; they are threatening the smaller garrisons and forcing the Italiansto use very large convoys on the roads. They are continually winning over freshadherents to their cause, and chiefs friendly to the Italians are now in a state ofconsiderable fear.33. Morale is low but not yet at breaking point. Given good rations, strongdefensive positions to hold and little air opposition, Italian troops may maintainsome morale indefinitely, but if repulsed when attacking they are likely to becomedemoralised.Turkey.34. The &apos;&apos; state of siege &apos;&apos; proclaimed in Istanbul and Thrace still continues,though black-out regulations have been temporarily relaxed. Public opinioncontinues to strengthen in favour of the Allies, and Libyan successes have arousedconsiderable enthusiasm.The Far East.China.35. There has been no major change in the situation during the last threeweeks. Japanese formations are believed to oe located as follows : Indo-China : One mixed brigade.Hainan : Two divisions (maximum).Canton Area : Three divisions and one mixed brigade.There are indications that one of the divisions now in Hainan may bereturning to Formosa.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Operations were again considerably reduced by unfavourable Aveatherconditions. Two attacks on Bremen were made on successive nights with highlysatisfactory results. Our bombers also concentrated on a &quot; Hipper &quot; class cruiserat Brest and on the shipbuilding yards at Wilhelmshaven. A number of success-ful attacks were made on enemy merchant vessels.Enemy attacks on this country were again on a low scale, although theywere heavier than in the previous week.Units of the Royal Air Force and of the Royal Australian Air Force took a prominent part in the capture of Bardia, their attacks on this and other targets in Libya being intensive and accurate.Operational aircraft casualties, extracts from recent Raid AssessmentReports, and a graph showing Enemy Air Operations over Great Britain aregiven in Appendices VI, VII and VIII.Germany and Occupied Territory.37. Bomber Command flew 20 day and 288 night sorties during the period.Wintry weather conditions were responsible for this further drop in the totalof night sorties.[22106] c
38. The very successful attack on Bremen on the night of the1st/2nd January, reported in last week&apos;s Resume, was continued on two successivenights. In addition to high explosive bombs many thousands of incendiaries were dropped. The dock area, railway station and factories were attacked,culminating in the whole target becoming a mass of flames. Two of our aircraft were missing as a result of these operations.39. On the 4th January eighteen Blenheims from Coastal Command were despatched to attack a &quot;Hipper&quot; class cruiser in dry dock at Brest. one aircraft estimated a direct hit on the cruiser, and hits were also reported on two destroyers and a small merchant vessel. This attack was continued at night by aircraft of Bomber Command. Unfortunately, the weather was so unfavourablethat it was not possible to identify the cruiser, but the estimated position was bombed by forty heavy bombers and a large tire resulted. The next day Blenheimsagain returned to the attack and some direct hits are believed to have beenobtained. During these daylight attacks enemy fighter opposition was encounteredas a result of which two Me. 109&apos;s were destroyed and one probably destroyed.Several Blenheims sustained damage, but only one was reported missing.40. Wilhehnshaven was the main objective on the night of the8th/9th January and visibility was good over the target area. Twenty heavy bombers concentrated on the shipbuilding yards and many large and small fires were started. The dock area was also bombed and the Tirpitz is believed to havebeen straddled by a stick of 500 lb. bombs. Thirteen other aircraft attacked the docks at Emden where two very large fires were observed.41. Light attacks were made on oil targets at Hamburg and Rotterdamand on the petroleum sheds at Emden. A.A. batteries were also bombed on anumber of occasions.42. On two nights Blenheims of the Fighter Command carried out offensive patrols over aerodromes in Northern France. Only one combat occurred and theenemy aircraft is believed to have crashed. These Blenheims subsequently bombedseveral enemy aerodromes with good results.43. A successful day attack was made by a Blenheim on a 5,000-ton Tankeroff the Hook of Holland, when a direct hit was obtained on the vessel&apos;s bow. ABlenheim also scored near misses on another Tanker in the same area.44. Coastal Command aircraft made several successful attacks on shipping-Six direct hits were made on a merchant vessel near Obrestad, and three hits on another vessel near Lister Light. One ship of over 1,000 tons was attacked nearBergen and lifted out of the water. Another smaller vessel sustained damage to her bridge and superstructure.45. On two successive days individual attacks were made by two Beaufortson an 8,000-ton Tanker in the Bay of Biscay. Near misses were reported and thebridge was attacked with machine-gun fire.Italy.46. On the night of the 8th/9th January ten Wellingtons from Maltasuccessfully attacked shipping, docks and railway communications at Naples.One stick of bombs was observed, to drop on or very near the stern of a. Littorioclass battleship. Several hits were also registered on buildings near the AngloiniQuay, and on the railway station and tracks. There were several explosions anda gasometer was fired. At Palermo, which was attacked by one aircraft, a hitwas registered either on the middle jetty or on a ship moored alongside. All.our aircraft returned undamaged from these operations.United Kingdom.47. Fighter Command flew 426 patrols involving 1,086 sorties by day and184 patrols involving 197 sorties by night. These totals are slightly higher thanthose of last week.48.   The scale of operations of the German Air Force during the week under review, although approximately double that of the previous week, was,&apos;still at a low level.   Reconnaissance was the chief daylight activity, andithis;was;)
mainly off tJhe eastern and south-eastern coasts of England. There were, however,a few penetrations inland by single aircraft and bombs were dropped in various parts of the country. On the 7th January attacks were made on aerodromes in the Home Counties but no serious damage was done.&quot; Our fighters werehampered by bad visibility, but they succeeded in destroying two enemy aircraft and probably destroying another.49. Operations by the long-range bombers consisted of attaeks&apos; on London-and Cardiff on one night each and on the Bristol area on two successive nights.On the three remaining nights there was no enemy activity over this country.Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying.50. Aircraft of the Coastal Command flew 200 patrols involving 445 sorties.These sorties included 219 convoy escorts which were maintained throughout theweek in spite of very unfavourable flying conditions on many days. Mines were successfully laid by both Bomber and Coastal Command aircraft off Lorient,Brest, St. Nazaire, the Elbe Estuary and the Jade and Weser Rivers.51.   Enemy minelaying was on a smaller scale than the previous week.Greece and Albania.52. Extremely bad weather has restricted operations. Elbasan was heavily bombed on three occasions and direct hits were registered on military buildings and road communications. At Valona ammunition dumps were bombed by nineBlenheims and several fires were started. Fighter opposition and intense anti-aircraft fire were encountered, and two of our aircraft are missing. One enemyfighter was probably destroyed.Egypt and Libya.53. Bardia was the main objective of our Air Forces in the early part ofthe week, and, in support of the land forces, operations were directed with theobject of enforcing the early surrender of the town, which had been bombedcontinuously since the 1st January. During these day and night attacks theBlenheims, Bombays and Wellingtons successfully bombed stores, dumps, motor transport, fortifications and troops, whilst the Hurricanes provided patrols fortheir protection. The accuracy of the bombing may be gauged by the fact that,although few military targets of importance at Bardia still stand, the town hashardly been touched.54. Later in the week the principal targets were Tobruk, where much damage was done to several military objectives, and Tripoli, which was bombed by Wellingtons from Malta on the 5th January and the following night. direct hits were registered on a large merchant vessel in the harbour, on the power station and on the customs house. Many bombs also fell among destroyers and merchant vessels. On the 8th a heavy raid was made on Benghasi, when direct hits were obtained on four or five ships in the. harbour and fires started in thewarehouses.55. Aerodromes and landing grounds were also heavily attacked on several occasions, and many enemy aircraft on the ground were either completely destroyed or badly damaged. Forty unserviceable aircraft, abandoned by theenemy, were captured by the army at El Adem.56. Italian air operations have been surprisingly small. Their bombers-have hardly made an appearance. Their fighters have operated, sometimes inforce, but their efforts have been ineffective and our fighter patrols have taken a heavy toll.Gibraltar.57. The usual patrols and reconnaissances were flown and escorts providedfor convoys and naval units. A photographic reconnaissance of Ownaga andTetuan was made on the 5th January. A hostile aircraft carried out a reconnaissance of Gibraltar on the 2nd and another was engaged and driven offon the 6th. .
Malta.58. During the week reconnaissances were made of the harbours at Naples,Palermo, Cagliari, Trapani, Taranto and Tripoli; of the main aerodromes in sicily; and of the Ionian Sea.59. A small formation of enemy aircraft approached the Island on the7th January, but retired before they could be intercepted.Sudan and East Africa.60. Our activity in this area has been on an increased scale. Enemy campson the Sudan-Abyssinia frontier were attacked on several occasions, and the aerodrome at Gubba was successfully attacked three times. Stores, dumps andmilitary buildings were bombed at Berbera and Hargeisha in British Somaliland.At Gundile, in Southern Abyssinia, a quantity of ammunition was successfullydropped to friendly tribesmen.61. Our attacks on Eritrean targets have been maintained. Massawa was attacked on three occasions and bombs fell near the submarine moorings and a destroyer.62. Pour Hurricanes of the South African Air Force machine-gunned the aerodrome at Bardera in Italian Somaliland. One aircraft was destroyed on theground and two more were damaged. Three enemy fighters managed to approachour formation unseen and two Hurricanes were shot down.In addition, several reconnaissances were made, and convoy escorts were provided over the Red Sea.Air Intelligence.Italy.63. There are firm indications of the arrival of units of the German AirForce in Italy. For some time past German transport aircraft have been flyingbetween Sicily and the Mainland, presumably transporting advanced parties,and it is possible that it is intended to operate these units from Sicily. TheItalians are reported to be making every endeavour to increase the aerodromeaccommodation at Rhodes.Bulgaria.64. A report, hitherto unconfirmed, but believed correct, states that three german aircraft, believed to be M.E. 110s, have recently been operating fromPlovdiv, engaged on a photographic survey of the Greek-Bulgarian frontier.65. The Germans have installed seventeen observation posts equipped withradio across Northern Bulgaria from the North-Western corner to the Black Sea.The arrival of anti-aircraft units is also reported.Japan.66. It is learned that in recent months Japanese vessels have brought petrol,oil, tyres and M/T to ports in Italian Somaliland.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.67. Weather conditions by day on the 5th, 6th and 7th January enabled the enemy to resume harassing tactics with single aircraft. On the 7th January,during the most extensive daylight raiding that we have known for some weeks,London was raided intermittently for 3^ hours, and bombs were dropped infifteen districts.   On the same day many incidents were reported from East
Anglia and the Home Counties, and one from Coventry. No important damage and few casualties were caused by these daylight raids.68. By night the enemy&apos;s main objectives were Cardiff, Bristol and, to a lesser extent, London. On the night the 2nd /3rd January a heavy attack wasmade on Cardiff; on the nights 3rd/4th and 4th/5th January the main attack was on Bristol, Avonmouth and Weston-Super-Mare; and on the night 5th/6thLondon was the main objective of a brief but widespread attack. On other nightsthere was little or no activity.Damage.Cardiff.69. The buildings of British Oxygen Co., Ltd., East Moors, were completelydemolished, and must be considered out of production for an indefinite period.Apart from this, direct damage occurred at only two factories, and in both caseswas slight. Nine key points were affected, in most cases indirectly through lossof utility supplies, or the presence of TJ.X.B&apos;s.70. The most important damage was done at the Gas Light and CokeCompany&apos;s Works at Grangetown where three gas holders were damaged, leaving the city for some time without supplies. Electricity grid-lines were damaged intwo places and several mains were also hit, with resulting local failures ofsupply. No important damage was done to the water system. No serious damage was reported from Cardiff Docks or Penarth Docks.Bristol, Avonmouth and Weston-Super-Mare.71. On the night of 3rd/4th January the attack was mainly with I.B&apos;s. onthe centre of the city and riverside areas of Bristol, and although many fires were started these do not appear to have interfered with the general working of the docks. The damage to utility services was lighter than in previous raids, althoughdamage to water mains hindered fire-fighting. No important damage was done to key points.72. On the night of 4th/5th January a few bombs fell in Bristol, but themain attacks were on Avonmouth and Weston-Super-Mare. The attack onAvonmouth was mainly with I.B&apos;s., which started many fires, but all were very quickly extinguished and the only appreciable damage was at Shell Mex and b.P.&apos;s oil installation, where the barrel-filling shed was gutted, but with no effecton deliveries.At Weston-Super-Mare damage was almost entirely to private property.London.73. Three shell-filling sheds were destroyed by fire at the ThamesAmmunition Works, Ltd., Erith, Kent, and production may be retarded for aweek. All work was suspended for 24 hours at Burgoyne, Burbridge &amp; Co., Ltd.,East Ham (Medical Supplies), but no further effect on production is expected.Apart from these two incidents the damage was negligible.Elsewhere.74. Industrial key points have been hit in Chester, Darlington, Purfleet,Newcastle, Birmingham, Coventry and Manningtree, but damage in all cases wasvery slight except at Whessoe Foundry and Engineering Co., Ltd., Darlington(Bombs), where there is loss of night work till black-out arrangements arerestored; and at B.X. Plastic, Ltd., Manningtree, Essex (Glass substitutes), wherea part of the plant was demolished.Casualties.75. The estimated casualties for the week ending 0600, the 8th January,are 398 killed and 691 seriously injured. These figures include 103 killed atCardiff; 127 killed at Bristol.[22106] d
Unexploded Bombs.76. The number of unexploded bombs remaining for disposal again shows a decrease. At 1800, the 6th January, the number was 1,267 as compared with1,544 a week earlier.Civil Defence Operations.77. In all raided areas this week it has been evident that people have takento heart the lessons of earlier raids and have concentrated on the task ofextinguishing fires in their initial stages.At Cardiff nearly all the fires were successfully confined to the premises inwhich they started, and though full reinforcements for the fire services werestanding by their help was not needed.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Results of Raids.The following reports of damage have been received during the week from air Reconnaissance and Intelligence Sources : Germany.Berlin. On the 13th/14th November a bridge in the Konigstrasse over theSpree Canal was destroyed. Railway tracks near Moabit were damaged and thePriedrichstrasse Station slightly damaged. The areas most affected were theLeipzigerplatz and the Leipzigerstrasse.The raid on the 15th/ 16th December had been described by two sources as most successful; the districts of Tegel and Steglitz suffered heavy attacks. TheSchoneberg and Papestrasse Stations were hit and traffic between Berlin andPotsdam was suspended. Bombs in the centre of the city did considerable damage to Wertheims stores and to the Police Presidency. Traffic on the undergroundfrom the Wittenberg Platz to the Zoo was stopped for two days and considerable damage was done to shops, houses and the cinema in the Tauentzien Strasse.Casualties are stated to have been 100 killed and 200 injured in this raid.On the 20th/21st December the Law Courts were hit and bombs fell near agas works in the Gitschiner Strasse. No. 44 Schmidt Strasse was completely destroyed and bombs fell in the Fehrbelliner, the Kaiser Friedrich and the TaunusStrassen. The cathedral, which was hit, was only slightly damaged, though for propaganda purposes the Germans greatly exaggerated it.Hamburg. On the 16th November eight heavy bombs scored direct hits onBlohm and &quot;Voss. Later in the month two Dutch East Indies vessels and a Germanauxiliary cruiser were sunk in the harbour, and a neutral seaman saw fivepartially-built submarines at Blohm and Voss which had been damaged.Cologne. Photographs taken by Bomber Command show the success of attacks upon the oil target at Wesserling. Many craters are clearly visible inthe centre of the plant, and there is no sign of activity or movement save for alocomotive under steam and some trucks in the sidings. Several buildings,including the power station, have received direct hits, and the power plant doesnot appear to be operating.Railways. As a result of the heavy attacks on Mannheim, the line fromLudwigshafen to Kaiserslautern was hit. in four places. It was closed to traffic and had not reopened by the 2nd January. Damage to the line between Mann-heim and. Frankfurt was countered by the use of alternate routes. On theMannheim-Heidelberg line goods trains had to be diverted owing to damage2 kms. from Mannheim.France.Boulogne. -Shortly prior to Christmas the Hotel Meurice received a direct hit and 33 German Officers were killed.Le Havre. Photographs taken by P.R.U. disclose additional damage to the roof of the harbour passenger station, considerable damage to the hangars of theC.G.T., to the roof of a large building in the Wire Drawing Mill and to sheds atthe South end of Schneider Works.Italy.Bari. -The oil refineries were so much damaged that a number of theworkmen had to be transferred to Leghorn, where the refineries were already working to full capacity.
Milan. ^Some of the stocks of rubber in the Pirelli works were destroyed.A large quantity of the stock from these works has been transferred to Triesteand Syracuse (IS l\ result of our raids.Naples. The last raid on Naples is said to have been second only in its success to the famous raid on Taranto by the Fleet Air Arm. The Cruiser Polasustained damage that will require at least six weeks to repair. There were many casualties among the personnel, including the Commander.Five mine-sweepers were sunk. .Seventy people were killed by one bomb that hit the Ilva ammunition works.The aircraft factory sustained two hits, and traffic was held up for ten hoursby damage to the Naples-Bari railway line.Norway.On the 27th December the Norwegian Steamer Arnfinn Jarl, of 1,200 tons,was sunk at Egersund as a result of air attack.Mining.In October a cargo boat of 5,000 tons, loaded with pigs requisitioned by theGermans from the Bretons, sank off St. Nazaire on its departure for Germany.Many pigs were washed up on the coast and collected by the inhabitants.In November an armed merchantman was sunk near Lorient.Photographs taken by Bomber Command disclose the presence of a sunkenmotor vessel about 2,000 yards from the coast due West of Julianadorf, nearHelder.  The vessel is about 540 feet long.A photographic reconnaissance of the Kiel Canal confirms the obstructionreported therein and the presence of a vessel sunk across the canal can be seen.It was alleged by the Germans that the sinking took place as a result of acollision, but this is so unlikely that, coupled with the fact that the sinking tookplace at the exact position in the canal where a mine had been laid, it is con-sidered that the blockage of the canal was a successful result of a mine-layingoperation.
