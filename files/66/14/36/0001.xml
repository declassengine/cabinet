At their Meeting&quot;1- held on the 20th January, the WarCabinet considered the state of readiness of our anti-gaspreparations.In the course of discussion? the following pointy awas made -X X X X&quot;(iii) If we were to give special publicity toanti-gas precautions in this country, theenemy might treat this as a pretext forstarting gas warfare, on the ground thatour precautions showed that we meant touse gas ourselves,The suggestion was made that the accounts of German gas preparations might beallowed to become public in the UnitedStates of America&quot;0XXX XThe War Cabinet -Invited the Chiefs of Staff to considerthe above suggestions2, The Ministry of Home Security is now.overhaulingcivil anti-gas measures and it has been arranged that steps should be taken towards the end of February, or possibly-earlier if necessary,  to wake up the public to thepossibility of invasion during the early springsProtection against gas will form part of this campaign,5. In our view it would be better that the anti-gasmeasures now being taken, and those incidental to thestiffening up of public opinion to invasion, should becarried through with the minimum of publicity.       It isparticularly necessary that there should be no publicityuntil our anti-invasion campaign is launched.* W.M.(4l) 8th Conclusions, Minute It.,

4.        We do not recommend, tiiepeHopo, that riny action should&quot;bo taken at. present to instigate publicity in Jjacriea a*boutGerman gas preparations,since our own press    would be almost certain to follow this lead and thus defeatour intention to avoid publicity at this stage.50 If,  in the event, it is not found practicable to bring our own preparations up to concert pitchwithout publicity, we agree that publicity in theUnited States of America about German gas preparationswould    be advantageous.(Signed)    DUDLEX&quot; POUND.&quot; J.
