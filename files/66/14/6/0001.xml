On thebasis of the decision then ta^en the Viceroy was informedthat we were prepared to support him in whatever steps were necessary to maintain peace in India, and India1s effectivepart in the war, but that before agreeing to the proclamat-ion of Congress His Majesty&apos;s Government must vnow more precisely the programme involved.   The possibility wassuggested of proclaiming the Wording Committee rather thanthe whole of Congress, and I asved for any new factsexplaining how the situation was developing.   Copies of thetwo telegrams which I sent to the Viceroy on 22nd Novemberare enclosed.    I now circulate the Viceroy&apos;s reply, togetherwith a telegraphic report of the development of the CivilDisobedience Movement for the weev ending 27th November.Paragraph 3 of the Viceroy?s telegram of 1st Decemberstates the Government of India&apos;s reasons for thinking thatthe declaration of the Wording Committee alone as anunlawful association under the Criminal Law Amendment Actwould not suffice,, if it becomes.necessary to tave-action under that Act.I should explain that the effect of a declaration underthe net is to make   it an offence to be a member of, or tocontribute to, or assist, the declared association, and togive powers to ta^e possession of premises used for thepurposes of the association and movable property foundtherein and- to forfeit the funds of the association.   Thepower to declare an unlawful association under the Act isyested in Provincial Governments, each of which would maveits own declaration, so that, so far as the Act is concerned,all-India action would not necessarily be involved, thoughit appears from the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 17th November(No. 2382-s) that it is contemplated that action would betaven in all Provinces.I am not entirely convinced by the arguments inparagraph 3 of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram, in&apos;favour of declaring.Congress as a whole to be an&quot;unlawful body.   Even though, asthe Viceroy explains, it would not.be the intention to prosecute individuals of minor importance for being membersof Congress, the effect of such a declaration would, infact, be to make   them liable to prosecution; and such asweeping measure as a declaration outlawing the whole of congress might arouse a good deal, of criticism.    It is not clear that it would be necessary to tave this step, if theGovernment of India&apos;s main objective of striving at theroots of the present anti-war campaign could be attained byproscribing the actual machinery of Congress, namely, the
Wording&apos;-Committee and the all-India Congress Committee andthe Provincial Committees.   The Government of India adduceonly two reasons for their more sweeping proposal: (1)administrative convenience, to which too much importance    -need n&apos;ot&quot;be&apos;attached, and (2) the psychological effect 6fv-striding at Congress as a whole.    In support of the latter .argument the Viceroy refers to a passage in a personal letter which he addressed to Governors of provinces on 8thAugust last, at a time when the action to he taven in theevent of widespread civil disobedience was underdiscussion.   The passage referred to reads as follows;-&quot;Apart, however,- from the fact that action againstCongress as a whole has the merit of simplicity(for a Notification including the words &quot;The.    Indian National Congress&quot; would cover all itsbranches and avoid the necessity of specifying anumber of particular Congress Committees orAssociations), I feel very strongly that the only,possible answer to a &quot;declaration of war&quot; by any- section of Congress in&apos;present circumstances mustbe -a declared determination to crush that organ-. .. isation as a whole.   In that view I hope you and your Government will concur.&quot; -As regards this I should -explain, that in some of therecent communications from the Government of India therehas appeared an underlying motive that we should aim atthe suppression of Congress as a political body.   A-ny suchidea as this must, I thinv, be impracticable.   We cannotrule .out the possibility that, after the civil disobediencecampaign is over,^Congress, if it should decide to co-.operate-with the British Government, will have the opportunity -unity of returning to power in the Provinces.    It-, thereforeseems to me. that it would be a mistave to tave action more drastic-than is necessary on practical grounds,.:merely in.order&apos;to allay the fears, of our would-be supporters as tothe ultimate return of the Congress Party to power when itis in a better frame of mind.I therefore suggest that we should inform the Govern-ment of India that we still feel that it would do more harm than good&apos;to&apos; outlaw Congress as a whole; that presumably ,.&apos;what is required is to prevent the functioning of the machineHrich is behind the.present anti-war campaign; that we wouldbe prepared&apos; to agree that, when the point is reached at whichthis becomes necessary, the: Wording Committee and.-.-the All-India Congress &quot;Committee should be- declared unlawful, andalso the Provincial Committees;---that in the case of thelatter Committees, however, we would live to vnow that theGovernor&apos;of each Province, in particular those .whereMinistries are&apos; still -in -off ice, agrees that such a coursewould be advisable.   If, on reconsideration, the Viceroy is satisfied that action on these lines would suffice, we wouldgive him.in this respect the degree of discretion for whichhe asvs in paragraph 6 of his telegram; -the effect of thiswould be&apos; .thatwhen he considers it necessary to tave this,i action he would refer the proposal home, but, having done so,\ if after 24 hours .the Government of India judged.that theI situation did not permit of longer delay, he would be free to: act without awaiting a reply to his reference.As regards the-suggestion that Gandhi should be warned thatwe should not interfere if he chose to starve himself, it willbe seen that the Viceroy anticipates that he would probably have an opportunity of conveying such a warning.INDIA OFFICE.5th December 1940.L.S.A
TELEGRAM from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy,dated 22nd November 1940.Personal.   Your personal telegram 2382-S of the17th November and my reply No.7315 of the 19th were considered in Cabinet-yesterday.- His Majesty&apos;s Government desire that it should be made clear to you that they are prepared to support you in what-ever steps are necessary to maintain peace in India andIndia1s effective part in the war but before they can agreeto Congress being proclaimed theymust vnow exactly whatyour programme involves,   prima facie they thinv it wouldgive rise to an infinity of trouble if it was intended tomave membership of the Congress party a criminal offenceand they found it difficult to see why it should benecessary to go further than to proclaim the WordingCommittee.     Cabinet would be glad to receive any new factsexplaining how the situation was developing and which had a bearing on the need for taking immediate action.TELEGRAM from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy,dated 22nd November 1940.1551Private and personal.   Your 2413-S,for which manythanvss did not reach me in time for Cabinet discussion.You will see from my No.7427 that they were anxious to vnowmore of your programme, that they make   a specific suggestion and as for any new facts regarding the situation.   Yourtelegram deals with the last, and I see that you would see1&apos;specific authorisation before declaring Congress unlawful orpromulgating Emergency Powers Ordinance.   But I thinv theCabinet would still appreciate (besides your reactions tothe suggestion which they have made) a rough indication ofthe vind of occasion on which you would propose to tavepowers under the Criminal Law Amendment Act*, how immediately and to what extent you would intend to use them and at whatpoint you would intend to&quot;supersede these powers by theEmergency Powers Ordinance.   Under the latter is it Congressor the Civil Disobedience movement at which you will directyour aim?As regards delay involved in reference home I would do everything possible to minimise it.   I fear we could notrely on its literally not exceeding 24 hours in presentconditions of telegraphic communications but I should hopethat not more than 72 hours would elapse from despatch ofyour telegram to receipt of my reply.The last sentence of your telegram maves clear whatis your particular need for the moment and you can tave it that you have full discretion to act according to the needsof the situation as regards individuals.As regards possibility of Gandhi undertaking a fastthe Cabinet suggested that it might be conveyed to him inadvance that we should not interfere if he chose to starvehimself.* which gives power to proclaim an organisation as unlawful, and to attach its funds.
TELEGRAM from Viceroy to Secretary of State for india dated 1st December 1940.2589-personal.   I am most grateful for yourpersonal telegrams 7427 and 1551 of November 22nd and for cabinet support to extent indicated.2.     There is of course no question of taking new powers under Criminal Law Amendment Act, or of their supersessionif Emergency powers Ordinance is promulgated.   Criminal law amendment Act is permanently in force and as you will seeclause 6 of Emergency powers Ordinance assumes its existence.Action under Criminal Law Amendment Act is directed againstassociation declared unlawful, and is primarily intended toprevent it from functioning, irrespective of its programme:action under Emergency Powers Ordinance is directed againsta revolutionary movement.irrespective of association whichpromotes it.   An association cannot be declared unlawfulunder Emergency Powers Ordinance, and without use of criminal law Amendment Act Congress committees could not be prevented from functioning without proving in each case that revolut-.. reactionary activities-were conducted at meeting.    The two enact-ments are thus complementary.   This will answer yourquestion whether it-is Congress or civil disobedience move-ment against which we shall direct,our aim.3.     It has always been our agreed policy that if actionbecame necessary against Congress first requirement wouldbe to prevent Congress from functioning at.all eitherthrough its committees or otherwise.   If this object is accepted notification of Wording Committee alone would be ineffective.   For instance, All India Congress Committeeis a larger and more radical body from which WordingCommittee derives its authority.   When Wording Committeewas notified by Government of India in 1932, all the.provinces were left ;to issue similar notifications inregard to a long list of subordinate Congress Committeeswithin their.jurisdictions and we are advised that notific-atlon of whole Congress.as an unlawful association would bea simpler and more effective way of achieving the sameobject.   Apart from administrative convenience there isconsideration mentioned at the end of paragraph 4 of myvery secret letter to Governors dated August 8th of which acopy&apos;was sent to you with Laithwaite&apos;s letter of August 18th.it must be remembered that Wording Committee and All india congress Committee are vept in power by general body of congress and act ion cannot logically be confined to them.-It is significant that at provincial conference-held at;Simla in August last Ministers of all three ministerialprovinces present referred in strong terms to possibilityi jthat after defeat of.revolutionary movement the party- jresponsible for it might be allowed to return to power andimpressed for assurances that history would not be allowed/ 4to repeat itself in this respect.   Anything which loo^s liveI half-hearted action will confirm these apprehensions anddiscourage our would-be supporters. It is therefore import-ant that..nothing in our action or utterances should suggestthat we regard as inevitable the rehabilitation of Congressor that in the expectation of coming to terms with it inthe near future we are deliberately refraining from accept-ing the challenge of the whole organisation. ..4.     If notification under the Criminal Law Amendment Actcomprises the whole of Congress it is not our intention toproceed against individuals of minor importance merely on grounds of membership,   prosecutions would be initiatedonly against persons actively engaged in carrying on wor1^of unlawful association or contributing to its funds.
5.   It is difficult to give precise definition of the ^indof occasion on which notification under the Criminal law amendment Act would become necessary.    In the graduallydeveloping situation such as now confronts us, the moment for action must be judged by the progress of the movement from individual to mass civil disobedience.   Although schemeof action described in Home Department&apos;s letter of August2nd to Provincial Governments (of which you have a copy)contemplated that notification of Congress.as unlawfulwould most probably be followed shortly by promulgation ofOrdinance, it is at least possible that timely action underthe Criminal Law Amendment Act might have sufficient:;paralysing effect on the direction of the presentrestricted movement to prevent situation from developing tothe point at which promulgation of more drastic Ordinancewould be necessary.    It is therefore important that weshould be free to use the Criminal Law Amendment Act when required.6.     As regards delay you will realise that an interval ofthree days in obtaining your orders would mean lapse of atleast five days from the receipt of recommendation from anyprovincial Government to date on which reply could becommunicated to them.   During this interval they would remain in doubt as to what instructions to give to their officers and the situation might rapidly deteriorate.   Iftherefore we are to wait for more than 24 hours for yourapproval of any proposed action I would urge we should have full discretion to tave action at any time after 24 hourshave elapsed if we judge that the situation does not permitlonger delay.    In present conditions I feel that this isnot too much to as1- and I earnestly hope that you and cabinet will agree to it.7.     As regards your suggestion that Gandhi should beinformed in advance in regard to our intentions in theevent of his deciding to fast, I agree that this would bevery desirable although it is doubtful whether it wouldinfluence him.   He wj.il probably inform me in advance ofhis intention to fast&apos;and unless I then see any reason tothe contrary I propose to tave that opportunity of conveyingwarning to him.TELEGRAM from Government of India, Home Department, toSecretary of State for India, dated 29th November, 1940.5/21.
