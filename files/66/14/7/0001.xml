Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1940/SECRET. Copy NoW.P. (40) 477.December 7, 1940.TO BB KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.GOVERNMENT  DEPARTMENTS:   PROTECTED  ACCOMMODATION.Memorandum by the Minister of A aircraft Production and the Minister ofWorks and Buildings.1.   WE have examined the Montagu House site.We have now recast our plans; our proposals are ready.It is possible to provide 42,000 square feet at this site at an estimated costof  4 per square foot, or  168,000 in all.The accommodation will give protection against 1,000-lb. semi-armour-piercing bombs.We can begin building at once with the expectation of completing the taskin six months.The authority of the Cabinet is desired.2. We have completed the plans for Horseferry Road, where there will beaccommodation amounting to 20,000 square feet. The probable cost of this undertaking is slightly more than  4 per square foot.Here we will have protection against 500-lb. semi-armour-piercing bombs.Work will begin now.   It will be completed in four months.3.   Adjoining the Horseferry Road building there are two gasometer sites.Here we can provide one of the strongest of the fortresses at an estimatedcost of just over  3 10s. per square foot.These sites would give us an accommodation 150,000 square feet in area, withprotection against 1,000-lb. semi-armour-piercing bombs.The undertaking would take six months to complete.(4) Curzon Street House. This is already under construction at a cost of less than  3 per square foot for an area of 34,500 square feet, with protection against 500 lb. semi-armour-piercing bombs.It will be completed on the 31st March next.(5) Dover Street Old Tube Station, An estimate was presented to theCabinewfrom Mr. David Anderson. It provided for a stronghold of 2,650 square feet at din estimated cost of  15,000.Enquiry by the Minister of Works and Buildings has resulted in a proposal that the existing tunnels should be enlarged from 10 feet to 16 feet 6 ins., as it isbelieved that the tunnels in their present state are too narrow for development.On this basis, the gross area provided would be 4,610 square feet and the cost would be  58,000, representing an expenditure of  12 10s. per square foot.The time required for completion is six months.[21997]
While the tunnels in their present condition are too narrow for development,the cost of constructing a stronghold of 4,610 square feet is felt to be very high.Further, on technical advice, we are satisfied that the Dover Street Old TubeStation will only provide protection against 500 lb. semi-armour-piercing bombsas against the resistance to 1,000 lb. semi-armour-piercing bombs afforded at theMontagu House site and the gasometer foundations in Horseferry Road.We recommend therefore that development at Dover Street should not beundertaken. This project should be abandoned in favour of Montagu house and Horseferry Road.(6) Cornwall House has been under consideration. On account of technical difficulties this project is deferred for the present.B.:M mm ?^mf. m^&amp;^$$A f ^ r.Ministry of Aircraft Production, S.W. 1,December 7, 1940.
