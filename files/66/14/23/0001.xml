Accordingly, it releases Eire from its undertaking to charter only through us, andleaves the Irish free to charter in the open market. To make this effective theMinistry of Shipping will tell the Norwegians and the Greeks that they must notcharter any of their free ships to Eire. The Norwegians are expected to accept this without difficulty. The Greeks may make some difficulties, but the Ministryof Shipping can bring them to heel by the threat of refusing space in convoys forany ships except those coming to the United Kingdom.Since the Ministry of Shipping has still not been able to complete its charternegotiations with the Greeks and the Norwegians, it would be convenient to it ifthe announcement of the ban on shipping for Eire were postponed until these negotiations are finished.4. It is a corollary of the curtailment of exports to Eire that the Controls ofthe Ministry of Supply must keep a careful watch on exports to Northern ireland to guard against smuggling across the border.5. No action can be taken in the sphere of exchange control without going beyond the ambit of the plan now envisaged. This plan is based on our ownshortage of supplies and is intended to be carried through by amicable approachesfrom the Departments concerned to the Eire Government. If the Treasury placeda ban on dollars to Eire for such imports as would still be left to her under theplan, this could only be construed as an act of open hostility.6. It is possible that the Americans may decide to send goods to Eire intheir own ships. If so, this will need careful watching. If the Americans sendmunitions for our own use as well as food, and if we are able to arrange trans-shipment from the Irish ports, the net effect might be beneficial to us; but if theyonly send food for the use of the Irish, we ought to try to persuade them to makethe sending of food conditional upon the Irish opening their ports to us.K.

Most Secret.)prime Minister, December 27, 1940.IN accordance with your request, I have had examined the question ofpatting pressure on Eire by the withdrawal of British shipping facilities.I apologise for its length, but it was important to cover every possible contingency.On the 3rd December Eire, by express regulation,^ banned all our warships from her six major ports and anchorages, yet nine-tenths of her imports and exports are carried in British-controlled ships under protection of British warships andat considerable sacrifice and inconvenience to ourselves..     2.   Eire&apos;s present use of British facilities.(a) Almost all her trans-Ocean imports, amounting to 1\ million tons perannum, are carried in British or British-controlled vessels sailing inour convoys.(b) Her imports from the United Kingdom, amounting to 3-1 million tons per annum, are carried mostly in British-owned coastal vessels.(c) Her export trade is mainly with the United Kingdom and carried inBritish coastal vessels.3.   The disadvantages resulting from the grant of these facilities.(a) The equivalent of some 40 British-controlled ships of 8,000 tons each havebeen exclusively engaged in carrying trans-Ocean cargoes to Eire with consequent loss to our own carrying capacity for essential supplies.(b) A proportion of Eire&apos;s trans-Ocean trade and all her United kingdom trade passes through the ports on our Western seaboard, addingmaterially to the heavy congestion in those ports.4.   Withdrawal of facilities. There appear to be three possible courses : (a) Merely to withdraw from Eire all British or British-controlled vessels,putting them into our own service. Subject, perhaps, to the special requierements of particular British trades, such as the Welsh coalexport trade, this could be effected without great difficulty and couldbe explained as the direct result of our own shipping losses. British-owned ships on Eire registry would be transferred to the British flagand employed to carry British cargoes.ib) To go further and to exclude from our convoys any Eirean or neutralship engaged in Eire trade. This also might perhaps be explained asa consequence of the shortage of convoy escorts which makes it essential for us to confine our protection to our own trade and that ofour Allies.(c) To try openly to strangle Eire trade by reinforcing the withdrawal oftonnage and convoy escort with the refusal of insurance facilities toany ship engaged in carrying cargo to and from Eire. The shipwarrant system could also be used to dissuade neutrals from engaging in the service of Eire, and rigorous Contraband and Export control could be applied to such seaborne trade as remained to Eire.5. Policy. It seems important that Eire should not be given theopportunity of representing herself as persecuted and that our pressure on Eireshould be made as palatable as possible to the Irish element in the United States.I therefore suggest that, at any rate to begin with, we should confine our measuresto (a): in my preceding paragraph. Eire is already finding it difficult to satisfyher requirements owing to the shortage of free shipping, and the withdrawal of almost all British-controlled tonnage from her service would have the most serious effect on her economy. Eire would not only suffer the disorganisation consequent upon the loss of a large part of her tonnage, but under present shipping conditions* Order 51 (1940) of Bire&apos;s Emergency Powers Act, 1939, in form applies to all belligerentwarships ; in practice it strikes only at us.
would find it almost impossible to obtain enough free ships to satisfy even herbare necessities. . If, however, the adoption of course (a) proved insufficient,pressure would be further increased by proceeding to (b) and (c).6. Eire&apos;s reactions. It is quite possible that even if we only proceeded tocourse (a) Eire might refuse to accept our explanations and become activelyhostile. She might even play with German fire. But without going to that lengthshe might well, as a reprisal, seek to divert her exports elsewhere, and send suchshipping as she had available to Spain and to Portugal or even to France. Herships, sailing to and from the mainland or Europe would, however, be subjected to contraband and enemy export control, so that both ships and cargoes would be liable to seizure unless covered by a sh&apos;ip&apos;s navicert. The ship&apos;s navicert wouldnot, of course, be given unless the cargoes were innocent and the ship carried nomails, so that at last Eire mails to Europe would be brought under examination.7. Naval Patrols for Eire Trade. In practice Eire would probably have difficulty in obtaining both new markets and new ships, so that sailings from.Eire&apos;s ports would be few and it would probably not be worth while to maintainpatrols off Eire ports except when special intelligence had been received. our existing dispositions for the interception of enemy trade should suffice to interceptall Eire trade, except that to Spain and Portugal, the routes of which passbetween the areas covered by the Western Patrol and by our submarine patrolsin the Bay of Biscay. The latter patrols should, however, be able to prevent any trade with France through the Biscay ports.8. United States Convoys to Eire. The adoption of economic measures against Eire may react upon our chances of obtaining supplies from the UnitedStates in United States convoys escorted by United States warships, since theState Department could more easily open a route through the Combat Zone to neutral Eire than to a belligerent port. I assume that we should not take anyof the measures suggested without being reasonably sure of American goodwill and that in particular we should be careful not to prejudice our chance of persuading the United States Government to send supplies to this country inUnited States convoj^s, either directly or via Eire. I suggest that, if UnitedStates convoys are considered to be practical politics within the near future, itmight be better to apply pressure to Eire by even slower stages than those setout in paragraphs 4 and 5 above. Thus if, to begin with, only trans-Oceai\.tonnage were withdrawn, the serious deficiency in Eire tonnage created therebymight provide the State Department with the necessary excuse to open Eire ports to United States ships. Even if at first United States ships were only permitted to carry supplies for Eire, this might lead to more favourable developments. If,on the other hand, no United States convoys at all were forthcoming, we could proceed to more drastic measures to achieve our other -objectives. It seems reasonable to exclude the possibility that the United States would stultify ourpressure on Eire by merely providing Eire with ships under the Eire flag.9. -Conclusion. Whether or not economic pressure leads to naval and air-bases or induces in Eire a greater, spirit of co-operation we still stand to gain.In depriving Eire of shipping, we not only increase our own carrying capacity,but relieve our Western ports of the transhipment of Eire cargoes. Moreover,less of our convoy effort will be wasted on unproductive shipping. There is, ofcourse, the danger that the anti-British elements in Eire might be driven togive greater underhand assistance to Germany. Such elements in the Governmentare, however, even more anxious to keep Eire out of the war than to hurt us andthey are unlikely to risk giving any assistance to the enemy which might provokeus to infringe their neutrality.A.
