DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December1940.SECRET. /   Copy No.   24W.P. (W) 488.December 22, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It. is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE POSITION IN SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, a letter fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Madrid on the position in Spain.H.Foreign Office, December 22, 1940.Enclosure.Sir S. Hoare to Viscount Halifax.(Private and Personal.)Dear Edward, Madrid, December 18, 1940.I AM really getting hopeless over the Spanish position. If you remember,I told you when there were the ministerial changes that I was doubtful whether should be able to deal with the new man. My doubts are now stronger than ever. He is completely ignorant of the world. He knows nothing about any-foreign country, except a little superficial stuff about Germany and Italy. worse than his ignorance is his rashness. All Spaniards seem to me to be rash to thepoint of irresponsibility, but he is worse than any I have yet met. I imagine that they have always been so, but I am sure that the anarchy and horrors ofthe Civil War have made their irresponsibility almost complete.The Tangier business is in every respect typical of this irresponsibility. Ifit is any comfort to us, they treat their own people even worse than they treatforeign Governments. Anybody, man, woman or child, may at a moment&apos;s noticebe thrown into prison or shot without anyone having the chance of investigatingor even discussing the case. Not a day passes without my having some newexample of this complete want of balance. In normal times I should say that itwas impossible to deal with a Government and country that behaves like this.Perhaps in these abnormal times we must deal with them, but how to do it isdifficult beyond imagination. If vou take a conciliatory line, they think you are giving way. If you take a strong line, they say that you are threatening themand start kicking against you like mules. I should have given up the attemptsome time ago if I did not feel that the Spanish people, like the French people,11243   [22049]
are becoming more and more anti-German. Unfortunately, neither in Francenor in Spain is there any means for public opinion to make itself felt.Unfortunately, also, apart from their inherent vices, both Governments, Frenchand Spanish, are captive Governments, the French Government entirely and theSpanish Government to a considerable degree so long as the Germans are on thePyrenees. I am not sure whether in London everyone fully realisesthe implications of this position. It means that with the Germans on theirback, there are many things that they cannot do, and, indeed, that it is almostessential for them, in the interests of their own safety, to maintain an appearance of hostility against us. It means that, so far as France is concerned, we can expect practically no answers to the innumerable enquiries and notes that wesend them, for the reason that the Germans will only allow them to communicatein ciphers that are held by the Germans.The more I think of these things, the more I am sure that we have to develop a different technique in dealing with these captive and semi-captive Governments.It is no good Whitehall expecting from them the kind of conduct that you would demand from a free Government. I feel sure that, you yourself fully realise theposition, I wish, however, someone could get it into the heads of Parliament.So far as Spain is concerned we cannot expect gratitude or common sense, and much less political sense. We must rather be ready to face endless gaffes andprovocations. Indeed, we must steel ourselves to the fact that what we do forSpain we do for our own advantage, namely, for the purpose of keeping the warout of the Iberian Peninsula, and not for the beaux yeux of this rash andirresponsible country.Yours ever,SAMUEL HO ARE.
