Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1941.i C Ai o4SECRET.Copy No.    28W.P. (41) 7.January 11, 1941./TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND ftffY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.the daily WORKER.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.IN accordance with Conclusion 11 of the Meeting of the War Cabinet heldon the 27th December, 1940 (W.M. (40) 310), I am bringing before the Cabinetthe question of the Daily Worker. At that meeting the unanimous view of theWar Cabinet appeared to be that the paper should be suppressed.As I stated in my previous memorandum of the 23rd December, there is inmy view sufficient ground for action against the Daily Worker and the week under Defence Regulation 2D, which enables the Home Secretary to issue anorder prohibiting the publication of any newspaper, if he is satisfied that insuch newspaper there is a systematic publication of matter which is, in the opinionof the Home Secretary, calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution to a successful issue of the war.There is no power conferred on the Home Secretary to take summary andadministrative action for the suppression of other forms of propaganda, and ifaction is taken against the Daily Worker and the Week under Regulation 2D,this step should not be regarded as a prelude to general action against communist propaganda. A newspaper being a continuous publication stands on a different footing from pamphlets and leaflets, and, as pointed out in my previous memo-randum, the suppression of these publications would be a more difficult matterthan the suppression of a newspaper.Moreover, the suppression of the Daily Worker and the Week should notbe treated as the first step in a movement for the suppression of the CommunistParty. I do not think that such action is at present necessary; and in my viewany attempt to suppress the Party by making its activities illegal, as was donein the case of the British Union, or by interning certain categories of leaders,would be undesirable at the present time. If it is necessary to order the detention of any Communists, this should be done on the ground that they have, as indi-viduals, been concerned in acts prejudicial to the public safety or the defenceof the realm, such, for example, as the slowing down of production, and not onthe ground that they are leaders or members of the Communist Party.If in the future circumstances arise making it desirable to consider further action, the matter should again be reviewed in the light of the circumstances then existing. But for the present any decision with regard to the Daily Worker andthe Week should, in my view, be based on the consideration that the HomeSecretary has been given special powers and therefore a special responsibility for dealing with newspapers which engage in anti-war propaganda, and that both these newspapers have for a long time been systematically publishing matter which is calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution to a successful issueof the war.H. M.Home Office, January 11, 1941.[22112]
