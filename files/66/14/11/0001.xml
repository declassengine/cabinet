Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1940.SECEET.Copy No.28W.P. (40) 481.December 14, 1940.V/TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ASSEMBLY OF AIRCRAFT FOR CHINESE GOVERNMENT INBRITISH TERRITORY.THE question which is submitted to the War Cabinet at the instance of theFar Eastern Committee is whether to permit in Burma or India the assembly and manufacture of aircraft, including military aircraft, for China.2. If a state of war existed between Japan and China we should feelcompelled to abide by the stipulations of Article 46 of the Draft Rules of AerialWarfare adopted at The Hague in 1923 (Annex I), which, though never ratified,we regard as the standard of neutral obligations. There is, however, no declaredstate of war between Japan and China, and the question is thus one not of legalitybut of expediency.3. On the 17th November, 1937, the Cabinet decided, in view of probableJapanese reactions, to withhold permission for the assembly of aircraft for China in Hong Kong. In January 1939 I discussed with the late Prime Minister a request for the assembly of military aircraft for them in Burma, and in the lightof an opinion by Sir R. Craigie that Japanese reactions would be bad we decidedthat we could not recommend the request to the Cabinet. The Chinese then *proceeded with the erection of a factory at Loiwing in Yunnan just across the burma frontier, under the auspices of Mr. Pawley of the American Inter-Continent Air. Corporation. This factory has since turned out a number of aircraft for the Chinese from parts and materials imported from America andtransported through Burma. It has now been severely bombed by the japanese and is exposed to further bombing. The company does not consider its furtheroperation at Loiwing to be feasible.4. On the 9th October Lord Lothian received an unofficial request fromMr. T. V. Soong, Chairman of the Chinese Aeronautical Commission, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should permit 100 American aircraft in crates in Manilaen route to the Chinese army to be assembled in Rangoon or Calcutta and flownthence to China.5. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors &apos; in Tokyo and Chungking have bothrecommended that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to agree to this request, the assembly of aircraft should take place in India and not in Burma.Sir R. Craigie added that.we should have to be certain of American support,and expressed the opinion that, while there would be a very bad reaction in japan, he did not think Japan would go to war with us unless she was otherwiseprepared to do so.6. The Governor of Burma and his Ministers are willing that, in so far as adequate facilities exist (i.e., without factory work), civil and trainer aircraft should be assembled in Rangoon and flown into China.   The Governor believesMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.11234   [22025]
that unless the threat of Japanese retaliation on Burma became quite imminentthe Ministers would take the same view as regards the very few military aircraft which it would be physically possible to assemble. He points out, however, thatin regard to the great majority of the aircraft received in Burma in anunassembled condition, more than mere assembly facilities would be required and he has suggested that the Loiwing factory might be transferred to british territory, though not to Burma, in view of the accessibility of Burma to Japanesebombing operations.7. The Chinese Government are known to be in favour of moving theLoiwing factory, and the Government of India have indicated that they would welcome its transfer to India (estimated to require four months) if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decide to permit this after considering the effect on relations with japan. On this point Sir R. Craigie has been specifically consulted and hasreplied that the project does not affect his estimate as described in paragraph 5above. He recommends, however, that the transfer should be effected withoutpublicity if possible, or, if publicity is unavoidable, that it should synchronisewith an announcement by the United States Government of some equally strikingmeasure of American assistance to China.8. Meanwhile, Lord Lothian telegraphed the summary (Annex II) of amemorandum, which Mr. T. V. Soong has communicated to President Rooseveltand wishes to be submitted to the Prime Minister, on air assistance to China. Thememorandum dwells on the situation created by Japanese air superiority and onthe need for a Chinese air striking force. It asks for 200 modern bombers and300 pursuit planes, to be assembled in Rangoon or India and adequately mannedand serviced, and it suggests the formation of a special Anglo-American air unit.9. It is clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not in a position to affordeither aircraft or personnel, but Mr. Soong&apos;s memorandum lends urgency to theconsideration of the question of the assembly of aircraft in India set out above.10. The political considerations involved are as follows : The situation has changed since 1937 and 1939 when the previous decisions were taken. Japan isallied to our enemies by the Three-Power Pact of the 27th September, 1940. she has obtained control of strategic points and aerodromes in the north of Indo-China, and there is good reason to believe that she is planning to extend herinfluence over Thailand and to establish naval and air bases in South Indo-Chinaas a preliminary to a possible attack on Borneo, the Netherlands East Indies or perhaps Malaya. In order to free herself for southward expansion she isendeavouring to reach an agreement with Russia, and, with the aid of pressure from Germany and Italy, to induce Chiang Kai-shek to make peace..11. It is therefore very much in our interests to encourage Chiang Kai-shek,who has appealed to the United States and ourselves for help, to continue hostilities-ties against Japan. My colleagues will recall from a paper on assistance to China(W.P. (40) 436) that apart from limited financial aid there is not much that we can offer in present circumstances. Permission for Chinese aircraft to be assembledin, India would be very welcome assistance in maintaining his struggle. Thetransfer of the Loiwing factory would have the additional advantage that, whilethe plant would ordinarily be occupied with Chinese orders for the next two years,it could be used by arrangement with the Chinese Government, or if deliveries to China became unnecessary or impracticable, for turning out aircraft for ourown use.12. As regards the United States, we should naturally inform them of our decision in the course of discussions regarding assistance to China which havealready begun. The United States Government will certainly welcome it, as mr. Cordell Hull has already informed Lord Lothian that they were going tosend aircraft to Chiang Kai-shek.13. Japanese reactions will, of course, be adverse, but, as indicated in para-graph 2 above, we have no legal obligations, and I concur in Sir R. Craigie&apos;s viewthat, if we grant the necessary permission, this fact is not alone likely to betreated by the Japanese as a casus belli unless, as part of the plans which Japanhas clearly been maturing in recent months, she were prepared for war with uson other grounds.
14. The Far Eastern Committee have signified their agreement with theforegoing considerations and I therefore recommend that the War Cabinet should agree to allow : (i) The moving of the machinery from the factory already existing atLoiwing to a suitable site in India for the manufacture or assemblyof aircraft for the Chinese Government.(ii) The export to China of military as well as civil aircraft from India(with transit facilities in Burma if necessary), provided that themilitary aircraft are not in a condition to engage in hostilities en route to their destination in China and therefore cannot be alleged to be using British territory as an operational base. (This conditionwould be met if the aircraft carried no ammunition or bombs and ifguns and bomb-racks were not fitted before departure.)(iii) The assembly in Burma of any aircraft, whether civil or military,received in Burma which require no more than assembly to completethem and their export under their own power to China subject to theconditions specified in (ii).(iv) The entry into British territory of any Chinese pilots, whether membersof a combatant force or not, for the purpose of flying Chinese aircraft from there intofChina, subject to the conditions in (ii).15. In order to bring the above proposals into strict conformity with article 46 of the Draft Rules of Aerial Warfare (see Annex I), it would benecessary to amend them in the following particulars : (a) Proposal (ii) : bomb-racks and guns should not only not be fitted, but should not accompany theaircraft; and (b) Proposal (iv) : the crew of the aircraft should not include anymember of the combatant forces of the Chinese Government. Amendments inthis sense would make it possible to reply to any Japanese complaint not only that in the absence of a state of war we were under no obligations in the matter,hut that, even if there were a state of war, we had fully carried out our obliga-tions as a neutral. There are, however, the following practical difficulties : Theonly alternative route for bomb-racks and guns would be to ship them to burma and forward them by the Burma Road. In view of the congestion on the road and the accessibility of the Road to Japanese attacks, these appliances mightnever reach the aerodrome to which the aircraft had been flown from India, andwould in any case only arrive with some delay. As regards allowing Chinese to fly the aircraft, we ourselves are unlikely to be able to spare pilots for this work,and inconvenience as well as delay would be caused by refusing to allow theChinese to fly the aircraft into China.16. I therefore suggest that the recommendations in paragraph 14 beadopted as they stand.H,Foreign Office, December 14, 1940.ANNEX I.Draft Rules of Aerial Warfare (Hague 1923).Article 46.A NEUTRAL Government is bound to use the means at its disposal 1. To prevent the departure from its jurisdiction of an aircraft in a conditionto make a hostile attack against a belligerent Power, or carrjdng oraccompanied by appliances or materials the mounting or utilisation of which would enable it to make a hostile attack, if there is reasonto believe that such aircraft is destined for use against a belligerentPower.2. To prevent the departure of an aircraft, the crew of which includes anymember of the combatant forces of a belligerent Power.3. To prevent work upon an aircraft designed to prepare it to departin contravention of the purposes of this article.
On the departure by air of any aircraft despatched by persons or companies in neutral jurisdiction to the order of a belligerent Power, the neutral government must prescribe for such aircraft a route avoiding the neighbourhood of themilitary operations of the opposing belligerent, and must exact whateverguarantees may be required to ensure that the aircraft follows the routeprescribed.ANNEX II.Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Halifax.- ^Received November 30.)(No. 2860.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.)   Decypher. Washington, November 30, 1940.FOLLOWING is summary referred to in my immediately preceding telegram : Japan has already lost 1,100,000 soldiers in China. She now realises that itis not possible to crush the Chinese armies, and is withdrawing troops from Chinafor advance into Indo-China, Netherlands East Indies, and Malaya. She is morethan anxious for an easy peace with [group undecypherable ? Chiang Kai-shek],which could be revoked in the event of final victory over the British Empire.On the other hand, the Chinese army and people are beginning to feel the strain because (1) Financial and economic situation is deteriorating owing to the loss ofrichest territories, and the expense of keeping large numbers of menunder arms.(2) Popular belief in ultimate victory of the democracies has been shakenedby continued German successes.(3) Constant bombing of troops and especially civilians is telling on thegeneral morale. Hitherto the Chinese air force using first American,and later Russian planes, and being able to operate on interior lines,had maintained some resistance. Owing to the fact that Russia hasstopped sending planes, and that the Japanese aircraft since september have been found much superior in quality as well as in[ ? actual] numbers, no existing Chinese planes can take the air.In the present military situation, the Japanese could, by concentrating on afew strategic centres, withdraw a large portion of their army and transports from china, since the Chinese could not counter-attack well fortified areas withoutair support. With air support to the extent of about 500 planes and advantageof interior lines, they could easily recapture Canton and Hankow and oblige theJapanese to retain their forces in China. Moreover, such a striking force couldby its threat to Japan proper, Formosa, and Hainan act as a most effectivedeterrent to the Japanese designs on Singapore and Netherlands East Indies.This force need not exceed 200 modern bombers and 300 pursuit planes, but must be adequately manned, and, above all, serviced. For greatest efficiencyBritish and American personnel should be drawn upon and formed into a specialair unit whose status would receive special consideration. Force should be createdat once so as to be ready to operate before the Japanese spring offensive againstSingapore. Planes could be assembled in Rangoon or India, flown to China, ortransported by water from Rangoon to the Chinese frontier and assembled there.There are 136 air fields in China, more than half in excellent condition and allserviceable for both bombers and fighters; several are within 650 miles from japan, are not easily vulnerable to army attacks.Organisation and equipment of this special air unit would take at least threemonths and the decision should, therefore, be taken within the next two weeksif it is to be ready in the critical Spring of 1941.In laying these proposals before His Majesty&apos;s Government and,the UnitedStates Government, Chiang Kai-shek begs for prompt decision, and reiterateshis identification of purpose in the common struggle for democracy.
