TO BE KEPT UNDH1R LOCK AMD KEY.*3 %i36th December, 1940.WAR   CABINETDISPERSAL OF AIRCRAFT FACTORIESMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of food.     I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister of Aircraft Production inhis desire to secure the rapid dispersal of aircraft factories and obtainpremises without the delays that might arise from conflict with the interestsof other Departments.20     I cannot, however, concur in his proposal that such conflict should be automatically resolved in all cases by his having the right to take any premises, anywhere, not in actual occupation, even if the exercise of this right be restricted to cases in which removal or dispersal is necessitated by enemy action,,3.     The effective dispersal of food stocks is hardly less important than the dispersal of aircraft factories, and the Ministry of Food has necessarilyearmarked many buildings as reserve depots for emergency use in the event ofexisting depots being bombed.    It is of the essence of the system of fooddispersal that each of these reserve depots shall be (a) unoccupied, and(b) available immediately to the Ministry of Food, at the time at which therelative existing depot is destroyed or seriously damaged by enemy action.It is at this time and on this condition, under the Minister of aircraft production^ proposal, that the depot is to be automatically at the disposalof his Department,    It is obvious that the adoption of the proposal would render completely nugatory the whole system of reserve depots which thethe Ministry of Food has built up, and I am quite clear that I cannot acceptthe responsibility of agreeing to the proposal in its present form.4C     But I am anxious that my Department shall give every possible assistanceto the Ministry of Aircraft Production in the circumstances envisaged, and Ishall always be prepared to give up unoccupied premises earmarked as reservefood depots (provided they are not immediately required for use as fooddepots in consequence of enemy action) if.and as soon as alternative premisessuitable for food storage can be found within a reasonable distance.50     In the event of no solution satisfactory to both Departments being achieved by these arrangements, the right to use particular premises mightsuitably be made the subject of summary arbitration by the Minister without portfolio.6.     I do not think I can go further than this.    The smooth distribution offood is of vital importance, and the maintenance of an effective system.....of reserve food depots is essential to it.W.Ministry of Food,6th December, 1940.
