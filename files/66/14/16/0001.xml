Printed for the War Cabinet.  December 1940.W.P. (40) 486.December 19, 1940.MOST SECRET.JCopy No.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.CONTACTS WITH THE VICHY GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT may be convenient if I summarise briefly for the information of mycolleagues the results of our recent exchanges with the Vichy Government.2. Our object has been to obtain satisfactory assurances from Vichy on thefollowing points : 1(1) That the Vichy Government intend and are able to retain control of theirFleet;(2) That they will effectively prevent their ports or territories being used asbases for air or U-boat attacks on us;(3) That they will resist German or Italian attack on or infiltration intothose territories which have remained loyal to the Vichy Govern-ment; and(4) That they will, for the time being, tacitly adopt a policy of refraining from operations against the Free French colonies.3. On our side we have declared that we do not covet or seek to acquire any French territory, and that we would be prepared to help any French resistance to German or Italian designs to the best of our ability. If any part of theFrench Empire should declare for General de Gaulle, we would recognise itsaccession to his cause and would defend it from the sea. We have already declared our intention when victory is achieved of restoring the greatness and independence of France, and this covers those parts of the Empire which have declared, or may declare, for General de Gaulle. If we could be satisfied on thefour points set out above, we would, on our side, refrain from undertaking anyoperation against Dakar so long as the Viqhy Government undertook not to allowit to fall into enemy hands. Provided these proposals were accepted by the vichy government, we would be prepared to begin economic discussions with them and examine any concrete proposals which they might wish to put forward.4. We have so far received assurances in writing from the Vichy Govern-ment that they are determined to retain control of their colonial Empire and Fleet,and that they will not take the initiative in attacking us. Beyond this it maybe difficult for the Vichy Government to engage themselves on paper, since theymust be careful in their correspondence with us to avoid rousing Germansuspicions.11238   [22030]b
5. We have had, however, two valuable contacts. Professor Rougier came to London in October as an emissary of Marshal Petain and was received by thePrime Minister and myself. As a result of these conversations, he prepared a paper which he proposed to use in speaking to Marshal Petain and General.Weygand. After indicating that British morale was splendid, that nocompromise peace would be acceptable and that we had the financial means andthe armaments to enable us to continue the war, the memorandum went on to saythat we would restore the French Empire if France did not help our enemies.If General Weygand joined us again he could count on our wholeheartedcollaboration and a share in United States assistance. We would not answer forthe future of France and her Empire if naval or air bases were surrendered, andwe would attack the Government responsible for their surrender. Active orpassive assistance from France would mean some relaxation in the blockade.6. Professor Rougier has since seen Marshal Petain, and in a letter addressed to the Prime Minister and myself states that the Marshal has giventhe following assurances : (1) France will sign no separate peace with the Axis before the terminationof hostilities between the British Empire and Germany;(2) France will not cede air or naval bases or the French Fleet to the axis power and will resist by force of arms in North Africa any attempt on the part of the Spaniards, Germans or Italians to seize hercolonies;(3) France accepts the submission of French Equatorial Africa to general de Gaulle as a fait accompli up to the termination of hostilities, it being understood that French Equatorial Africa will be restored toFrance on the termination of hostilities and that no new enterprisewill be directed against French Eftot Africa, Morocco and north africa. (It will be noted that assurance (3), by recognising theexisting position in Equatorial Africa, goes further than we asked the Vichy Government in our official communication-see para-graph 2 (4) above. It should also be noted that we have not so fargiven the Vichy Government any assurance that we will urge general de Gaulle to refrain from any further attacks upon Vichy colonies.)A translation of the relevant part of Professor Rougier&apos;s letter forms Annex I tothis memorandum. A translation of his more detailed report on his visit to Vichyforms Annex II.7. More important than the above are the conversations which Mr. PierreDupuy, the Canadian Charge d&apos;Affaires, has recently had at Vichy. I sawMr. Dupuy before he left London for Vichy and informed him fully of ourexchanges with the Vichy Government and what our requirements were.Mr. Dupuy, who is now on his way back to London, saw Marshal Petain twice.On the second occasion he saw the Marshal and Admiral Darlan together.Admiral Darlan told him that the French Government would resist german pressure on them to attack the de Gaulle colonies, anyway until February andpossibly longer. (General Weygand, on the other hand, implied to ProfessorRougier that he renounced any intention of reducing Equatorial Africa by forceof arms.) He added that there was now no question of Germany being granted the use of French metropolitan or African bases. If the German pressure becameirresistible, they would invite us in time to take the bases over. Admiral Darlanwas confident that the French ships would have time to leave metropolitanharbours, but if not they would scuttle themselves. Mr. Dupuy asked marshal petain if he agreed with these views and the Marshal said &quot; Yes.&quot; admiral darlan also gave a definite assurance that the French Fleet would not becomeembroiled with the British Fleet and in particular that it would not attackFrench colonies. Mr. Dupuy has formed the opinion that Marshal Petain isgenuinely anxious for a British victory. He reports that General Huntziger,the Minister for War, who has great influence, is definitely pro-British and issecretly organising 5th column activities. It was the general view that general de Gaulle should be fighting Italians rather than Frenchmen and that, if his army went to Egypt, France would generally appreciate his action and Frenchunity of front might be recreated. (It is noteworthy that Marshal Petainsuggested to Professor Rougier that we should send General de Gaulle to anothersphere of operations such as Egypt or Greece.)
SI8. Mr. Dupuy points out that it is inevitable that, outwardly at least, a deterioration of relations should continue between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the French Government. If it looked as if we were working togetherGermany would intervene. Behind this outward tension France is praying fora British victory. It is, however, essential to move with caution and to avoidpremature action.9. My colleagues will recall that they approved the principle of individualapproaches to members of the Vichy Government and that they agreed toMr. Dupuy&apos;s journey to Vichy, for which, I think, Mr. Dupuy merits our thanks.If the assurances that he has obtained can. be relied upon, they would seem toshow that the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government have adopted of firm andstraight language we have threatened to bomb Vichy combined with a sympathetic understanding of France&apos;s present unfortunate position vide thePrime Ministers broadcast to the French nation is in existing circumstancesbest calculated to encourage the resistance of France &apos;s present leaders to Germanand Italian pressure, and thus serve our war effort. I would propose that weshould take advantage of any other reliable emissaries that may be available fromtime to time to maintain the direct contact which Mr. Dupuy has established.Mr. Dupuy might with advantage return to Vichy at a later date.10. No progress has so far been made as regards the general economic discussions which the Vichy Government proposed to us (see end of paragraph above). The Vichy Government have not responded to our invitation to makeconcrete proposals, and although we invited them some three weeks ago to send a representative to Madrid to discuss economic matters with a representative here, there has as yet been no response, although we understand that proposals may be on their way In view of the present heavy leak in our blockade,the Vichy Government are probably less anxious to talk about trade than theywere a month or two ago. We have, however, arranged a barter deal betweenSpain and French Morocco (phosphates against tea and sugar), and are nowtrying to arrange a somewhat similar deal with Morocco for ourselves.H.Foreign Office, December 19, 1940,[22030]
ANNEX I.Extract from a letter from M. Rougier to the Prime Minister and Lord Halifax&apos;.(Translation.)Mr. Prime Minister,Dear Lord Halifax, Lisbon, December 5, 1940.I HAVE brought back from Vichy three assurances from Marshal Petainwhich he asked me to communicate to you : i) France will not sign a separate peace with the Axis before the end ofhostilities between England and Germany,(ii) France will not surrender air or naval bases or her fleet to the axis power and will resist in North Africa by force of arms any attempt on the part of the Spaniards. Germans or Italians to take possession ofher colonies.(iii) France accepts as a fait accompli until the end of hostilities the sub-jection of French Equatorial Africa to de Gaulle, it being understoodthat French Equatorial Africa will be returned to her at the end ofhostilities and that no fresh operation will be directed against FrenchWest Africa, Morocco or North Africa.This third condition was the most difficult to secure, Darlan and Lavalwishing to send the fleet to recapture Libreville. This result is due in large part to my personal intervention.I think I have thus attained my first objective : to prevent the irreparablebetween England and France. I think I have thus spared Great Britain the loss ofa great number of human lives and of millions of pounds sterling. I think I havespared France a new catastrophe in which her honour would have foundered.I am sending you through Sir Noel Charles a series of notes relating to the relaxation of the blockade, British broadcasts in French, the special position ofMorocco, the attitude to be adopted towards Weygand, &amp;c. I beg you to be guided by them for the good of our two countries and the successful outcome of thewar.....(Signed)      LOUIS ROUGIER.ANNEX II.M. Rougier&apos;s Report.I. Immediate effects of my intervention with Marshal Petain.IN his interview with Hitler, Marshal Petain had been convinced that theBritish would be defeated. That is why he had accepted the principle of collaboration, which, however, lacked any practical significance.2. My written and verbal explanations between the 9th and 11th Novemberchanged his certainty. I was helped in this by Colonel Fonck, &quot; the ace of aces,&quot;the great airman of 1914-18, whose theoretical deductions on the impossibility ofthe Reich conquering England by bombing were corroborated by my direct evidence.3. On the 11th November, after my last intervention, the Marshal caused atelegram to be sent to Sir Samuel Hoare, stating that he would never surrenderair or naval bases to the Axis, on condition that the British ceased to attack with de Gaulle the possessions in North Africa which had remained faithful to Vichy.II. Modus vivendi covering the French colonies in North Africa.4. The Vichy Government declared to me in conformity with whatGeneral Weygand had confided to me four days before that they would considerthe occupation by Great Britain and de Gaulle of French Equatorial Africa as a fait accompli. They accordingly renounced the attempt to reduce the dissidentcolony by force of arms.
- 5. In return they expect the British Government to undertake not to embark on any attempt to cause a rising in French West Africa, Morocco or Algeria.6. A rising of these possessions would have as immediate result the intervention of the Spaniards, the Germans and the Italians in North Africa,either directly or indirectly, by means of intolerable pressure on MetropolitanFrance. North Africa was not at the present moment in a position to resisteffectively with its own resources such an intervention.7. I informed General Weygand of Mr. Winston Churchilhs proposal toarrange a meeting at Tangier or Gibraltar of two staff officers, French andBritish, to discuss the immediate military assistance which Britain would afford the French Empire, should the latter have to resist a German, Italian or Spanishattack. The General refused. He argues that such a meeting would certainly be known to the Germans, who would order the Vichy Government to dismiss him.As there is no question of surrendering bases, the question of defending theEmpire does not arise. As the Empire is not yet sufficiently strong to take partin the final victory, the question of an offensive on the part of the Empire is forthe moment inopportune. Such a possibility could only occur in a much more advanced phase of the war.III. The case of de Gaulle.8. The attacks of General de Gaulle on the civil population at Libreville,his offer to set free the hostages which he had taken in return for the impunityof his supporters who were being detained by the Vichy Government, have turnedagainst him almost all the officers, even the most Anglophil. No future agreement is possible between de Gaulle and the army, the navy and the Vichy Government.Marshal Petain suggests to the British that General de Gaulle should be sent toanother sphere of operations in Egypt or Greece. Many colonial officers declared to me that they would go and fight in the English ranks if they did not run therisk of being forced to fight under the orders of General de Gaulle against otherFrenchmen.. IV. Commercial A agreements.9. Further to the Madrid agreements, M. Monick. Secretary-General of theResidency in Morocco, told me this :  10. The Moroccan firms importing American goods have to ask for navicertsfrom British Consulates, which is contrary to the clauses of the Armistice. TheAmerican exporting firms ought to be authorised to put forward requests fornavicerts themselves.11. It is very important that Morocco should remain prosperous, thanks tothe freedom of her overseas trade. It will thus afford a proof of the abundanceproduced by liberal economy in contrast to the general misery caused by economicautarchy.12. In addition, M. Chatel, the Director-General of the Weygand Mission,drew my attention to the need to supply Algeria and Tunisia with coal, whichwas indispensable for the gas and electricity which were lacking.V. British Broadcasts.13. One of the mistakes of British propaganda consists in contrasting the loyalty of the former French Ministers, whose incapacity, corruption andfanaticism are to a large extent the cause of the French disaster, with the bad faith of the new Ministers (with the exception of Laval), who are not personallyresponsible for the disaster, being new men, although they have to bear its immediate consequences. Whatever happens, the French should not be given theimpression that the British would return to power the tarnished men of the FrontPopulaire. This is a frequent objection, particularly in bourgeois circles. Thegreat criticism of England made by the majority of Frenchmen is not that she)was so extraordinarily slow in transforming herself into a war machine; it isthat she financed the 1936 elections, which brought Blum and the Front Populaire
to power. The Front Populaire literally made France rotten, and if the popula-tion of London is severely bombed, they owe it in large part to their so-calledfriends, who undermined the moral and spiritual forces of France.14. The British Government should mistrust the Comerts, the Cassins andtheir friends. They should not make Communists, Socialists and Jews speak onthe wireless. They should remember that the British democracy is am aristocraticdemocracy, whilst, the democracy of France was a pluto-demagogy. the budgetary initiative granted to the Chamber of Deputies, and the inability of thePresident of the Council to dissolve Parliament, made the French Parliamentarysystem mean something quite different from the British system; it did not mean the control of the acts of the governor by the governed, but arbitrary government by the masses; that is to say, jacobinism.15. As the words &quot; democracy &quot; and &quot; Parliament &quot; do not have the samemeaning for Englishmen and Frenchmen, the British wireless is constantlyprovoking misunderstandings in the minds of its French listeners.16. British propaganda in French forgets too easily that Germany is inpossession of terrible pledges (two million prisoners, two-thirds of the territory)which considerably reduce the independence of the Vichy Government.Nevertheless, this Government preserves a certain power of intimidation inrelation to the Germans, as was proved by their protest against the territorialexpulsion of the Lorrainers and the stopping of this transfer.of population. the vichy Government is now the least bad of the possible Governments from theEnglish point of view, having at its head a man of honour whose word is thatof a soldier. Any fresh Government would be worse and might reopen thequestion of naval and air bases.VI.  The Professor&apos;s Plans.Being&apos; struck with the slowness with which the American peace industry istransforming itself into a war industry, the Professor would like to use his personal friends, Walter Lippmann, Paul van Zeeland, the University economists,in order to provoke a great movement of public opinion with a view to (i) makingthe United States understand their enormous responsibility in the European crisis(tariff policy, laws against immigration, torpedoing of the London MonetaryConference, &amp;c); (ii) making them understand that it is no longer a questionof whether the British Empire, assisted by the United States, will be victorious,but in how long it will be victorious; (iii) preparing for the period after thewar, by accumulating reserves of food for starving Europe, stocks of raw materials for the recovery of her industries and the absorbing of her unemployed, &amp;c.18. After organising this campaign of public opinion, he proposes toestablish himself either in North Africa (preferably Morocco) or at Geneva, where he will be best placed to assist the British victory.19. In the meantime he asks the Foreign Office to introduce him toLord Lothian, and requests the British Ambassador to facilitate his personalactions by all means in his power.20. The British Embassy at Washington can always find him at thefollowing address : New School for Social Research, 66 West, Twelfth Street.New York City, U.S.A.Appendix to Part V of Annex II.Notes on British Propaganda.I. Comments on the Past.BRITISH propaganda in the French language quite naturally turns on themost important event in Franco-British relations since the beginning of the war,that is to say the armistice.2. In point of fact France hardly thinks of the armistice. She thinks ofthe military defeat from which the armistice resulted.
3. British propaganda makes a mistake whenever it speaks of the&quot; defection &quot; of France in June 1940.4_(a) The French have seen their defeat.   Not one of them supposes thatthe struggle could have been continued with the remnants of an army which wasall that was left. It is useless to say to a people whose men have all passed atleast one year in barracks that the struggle could have been carried on with troopswithout organisation, discipline, or equipment.5. The anti-British propaganda comments on the reproaches which GreatBritain makes about the armistice by taking up an old slogan : &apos;&apos; Great Britainconsiders herself injured because she has not been able to fight to the last Frenchsoldier.&quot;6. (b) Five months after her defeat France has had time to reflect on the causes of her disaster.7. By an immense majority she lays the blame on the incapacity of thepoliticians and the demagogy of the &quot; Front Populaire,&quot; which was the climax ofa regime lacking in firmness.8. The exploiters or the parasites of the old state of affairs alone continueto regret it. Their motives are basely personal. But France has understood thatshe can only rise again by sufferings and renunciation on the part of all.9. For this reason British propaganda should not compare the &apos;&apos; loyalty &apos;&apos;of former French Ministers whose incapacity and vices were notorious, with the&quot;bad faith&quot; of the new Ministers who have inherited an impossible situationand, being for the most part men who have never before had the responsibilityof government, cannot be held responsible for the disaster.10. The former Ministers are completely discredited by their incapacity.Great Britain should not give the impression that she continues to have dealings with these people who have fallen into public contempt. To do so, lends substanceto the reproach made against Great Britain that she desires the return of &quot; theold gang &quot; because they meekly followed the wishes of the Cabinet in London.11. At the present time it can be said that there are emotional andsentimental factors which make the French wish for the victory of Great Britain(hatred of Germany, the humiliation of defeat, the sufferings of the occupation).12.   As opposed to these emotional factors there is an argument which prevents their reason from following the dictates of their hearts, namely, thatj the victoryjif J^jeaLBritain might in_e_an.ih.e-re.furn of the old order.   The Frenchnolohger confuse respect for public liberties with parliamentary demagogy aspractised in France.13. The moment when British propaganda stops giving an opening for suchcriticism that is to say the moment it gives up harping upon the past theFrench will give much freer play to their wish for a British victory, for theywill no longer be divided between their hearts and their reason.14. To repeat, the regime which has collapsed is held responsible for defeat.Great Britain should avoid all appearance of having links with that regime.II. Comments on the Present.15. There seems to be some confusion about the present situation in France.Great Britain appears to identify support of the new regime with acceptanceof defeat.16. This is not so. Most Frenchmen have rallied to Marshal Petain, yet99 per cent, detest their defeat. &apos;17. The truth is that, although they are completely disarmed and havea knife at their throats, they clo not believe this defeat to be final so long as british resistance continues.18. But they do not believe that the regime and the men who allowed france to lose in a few years the dominant position which she held in 1918 could havesaved the country by taking refug-e in Africa.
19. But the armistice has not only a military side. It brought about a revolution, a change of regime. The old regime having given catastrophic proof of its incapacity and vices, it is natural that Frenchmen should rally to marshal petain. It is an incontestable fact that the popularity of the chief of the Stategrows steadily greater. It is to-day immense. But this does not mean that theFrench are reconciled to the idea of defeat or that the armistice has done morethan define the extent of their defeat.III. British Propaganda and General Weygand&apos;s Mission.20. When General Weygand was appointed Delegate-General of theGovernment in French Africa, the British press and wireless explained thathis task was to justify to the white and coloured population the Government^&apos;&apos; policy of surrender.&apos;&apos;21. Three or four weeks ago the British broadcasts changed their theme.General Weygand is represented as being in continual revolt against the Govern-ment. It is announced that he has refused to obey a summons to an audience withthe Marshal. It is suggested that he might join Great Britain and take up armswith the rebels.22. Both these lines of comment are harmful. The latter exposes the general to the wrath of the Italians and Germans. To represent him as an opponentof the Government&apos;s policy is to compromise him gratuitously. It would, indeed,be only too easy for the Germans to maintain that the General is in the pocketof the British and must therefore be sacrificed.23. The best thing would be for the British wireless not to mention general weygand. Whatever is said about him, good or bad, can be turned against him and against Great Britain herself.
