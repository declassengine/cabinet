naval SITUATION.General Review.An inconclusive engagement took place with a raider in mid-Atlanticnecessitating increased naval protection for our convoys now at sea.Although shipping losses have been below the recent weekly average,casualties have been caused by air attacks on our merchant shipping in harbour.&apos;The Mediterranean Fleet has been operating off the Albanian coast and insupport of operations in the Western Desert.Home Waters.2. Four transports carrying 8,460 troops from Canada arrived in the Clydeon the evening of the 24th.The Town class destroyers (ex U.S.S.) Rockingham, Stanley, Ripley andRoxburgh have arrived in home waters from Canada. Richmond, also on passage,had to return to St. Johns, Newfoundland, with minor engine defects.Three destroyers from Portsmouth carried out a sweep between the channel islands and Ushant during the night of the 23rd/24th December but without result.There was some E-boat activity on the late evening of the 23rd off the EastAnglian coast. H.M. Destroyer Verdun, escorting a coastal convoy off Lowestoft,engaged an E-boat, which is believed to have been sunk or seriously damaged.One ship in the convoy, the Dutch S.S. Stad Maastricht, was torpedoed andsubsequently sank while being towed into the Thames. H.M. DestroyerWestminster, escorting another convoy off Yarmouth, engaged and drove off anE-boat and suffered slight superficial damage. The minesweeping Trawler Peltonwas sunk off Yarmouth with only one survivor.H.M. Destroyer Berkeley was damaged by an acoustic mine in the thames estuary on the 20th, and H.M. Destroyer Garth was damaged by a near miss mineoff Sheerness on the 22nd. H.M. Destroyer Warwick was damaged by a mine offLiverpool on the 23rd; she was towed into the Mersey and beached.3. During an enemy air attack on Liverpool on the night of the 20th/21sta bomb fell into the dock occupied by H.M.A.S. Atistralia, missing her by 6 feet.The dock was three-quarters flooded at the time and no damage was caused tothe ship.In another air attack on Liverpool on the night of the 21st/22nd H.M.S.Foresight was damaged by a near miss and the Naval Victualling Depot was completely destroyed by fire. Damage to hydraulic pressure prevented sailing of destroyers and sloop escorts from Gladstone and Canada Docks, but pressurewas restored on the following morning.In an air attack on Portsmouth on the night of the 23rd the Torpedo Depotwas damaged and there were about 40 slight casualties. Considerable damage was also caused to the Royal Naval Barracks.North Atlantic.4. ^ On the morning of the 25th December H.M. Corvette Clematis, forming part of the escort of a south-bound convoy, reported that she was engaging anenemy raider 700 miles west of Cape Finisterre. Shortly afterwards H.M.S.Berwick reported that she had sighted an enemy 8-inch cruiser, which she engagedand drove off. Owing to low visibility the enemy was lost sight of steering to the westward and Berwick rejoined the convoy. Bertvick scored one certain hit onthe raider and possibly more and received several herself, having four marineskilled and one seriously wounded. H.M.S. Furious flew off reconnaissance air-craft to locate the enemy, but flying operations had to be abandoned on accountof the weather. The British S.S. Empire Trooper in the convoy reported being in need of assistance during the afternoon and H.M.S. Bonaventtire proceeded to her assistance.On the morning of the 26th Bonaventure intercepted the German S.S. Baden(8204 tons). The crew set their ship on fire and abandoned her and as the weatherprevented boarding Bonaventure sank her by torpedo, having picked up39 survivors.   . &apos; ^
Mediterranean.5. On the evening of the 18th December a cruiser force supported by destroyers carried out a sweep in the Adriatic as far as the line Bari to Durazzo;nothing was sighted and bad weather conditions made flying impracticable,&apos; TheCommander-in-Chief in H.M.S. Warspite with Valiant in company proceededup the Straits of Otranto in support and an improvement in the weather conditions enabled him to bombard Valona at 1-15 a.m. on the 19th December.About 100 rounds were fired and the results are believed to be satisfactory; fires were observed later. The enemy was apparently taken by surprise as no opposi-tion was encountered.Fleet Air Arm aircraft attacked Rhodes, Stampalia and Scarpanto on the17th December and started fires.   All our aircraft returned from this operation.His Majesty&apos;s ships Terror and Aphis, covered by three destroyers,bombarded Bardia at frequent intervals between the 13th and 18th December,coastal batteries returned the fire but none of our ships was hit. Terror wasunsuccessfully attacked by four torpedo-aircraft on the 16th. Aphis carried oui.a close-range attack on the 17th, entering the inner harbour under heavy machine-gun fire and sinking three small ships. Large fires were burning in Bardia forsome days.During the night 20th/21st December ten Swordfish aircraft from H.M.S.Illustrious attacked Tripoli harbour. Hits were obtained on the seaplane station,landing quays and warehouses. Another attack was successfully carried out onthe night of the 21st/22nd. On the afternoon of the 21st, nine Swordfish attackedan Italian convoy off Kerkenah Island, 120 miles north-west of Tripoli; one3,000-ton merchant vessel blew up and one of 6,000 tons was sunk. All our aircraft returned safely from these operations, but one failed to return fromreconnaissance.H.M.S. Malaya with two- empty transports arrived at Gibraltar from theEastern Mediterranean without interference from the enemy, but H.M. DestroyerHyperion, one of the destroyer escort, was mined off Pantellaria on the 22nd andsubsequently sank.Pacific.6. Five hundred survivors, apparently from British and Allied shipscaptured or sunk by raiders, have been landed at Emerau Island in the BismarckArchipelago. A medical officer and stores have been flown from Port Moresby totheir assistance.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. Three attacks have been made by surface craft and three by aircraft; oneof the latter claimed to have scored two hits by bomb.Enemy Intelligence.German.8. Air reconnaissance at Kiel on the 21st December showed the battle-cruisers Gneisenau and scharnhorst in the floating docks, the old battleshipsSchlesien and Schleswig-Holstein, and the pocket battleship Lutzotv alongsideprobably in dockyard hands. The 6-inch cruisers Koln and Emden were alsoalongside, and nurnberg was leaving dry dock. At Bremen Seydlitz was present,apparently completing. *On the 23rd December the Kiel Canal was known to be blocked by the sinking of the Finnish Inga, 1,926 tons, with a cargo of iron ore, as the result of acollision with the Danish Silkeborg, 1,806 tons. It is believed that the obstructionwill take several days to remove.Italian.9.   A series of air reconnaissances covered most of the Italian Naval ports in. the past week.  Two battleships, one Littorio and one Cavour, were located atNaples, and two Cavours at Taranto.  One of the Cavours at Taranto is believed to be the ship seen at Spezia earlier in the week.   The whereabouts of the Littorio[22056] B
damaged on the ilth November is not known. One 8-inch cruiser-was seen hidry dock at Naples, and nine cruisers of unspecified type at Taranto. There were three cruisers at Brindisi, two at Palermo, and one 8-inch and two 6-inch cruisersat Spezia. There were also nine destroyers - at Taranto and five each at Naples,Brindisi and Spezia.U-Boats. .10. The chief concentration of enemy submarines remains in theNorth-West Approaches, where there were five Germans and four Italians throughoutthe earlier part of the period under review. A number of submarines have alsobeen at work in the South, possibly three Italians distributed between Madeiraand the Azores, and one or two Germans off Sierra Leone.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.Note. The following figures give the losses which have been reported during the period the 19th to 25th December. They should not be confusedwith the figures shown for the last week in the diagrams of shipping lossesattached at the back of the Resume, which show the actual losses for eachcomplete week since the outbreak of war, and are only made up to midnightof Sunday-Monday of the week immediately preceding that covered by this. RSsume. Later figures are not included in the diagrams as they are likelyto be unreliable, owing to delayed notifications and uncertainty regardingthe result of recent attacks.11. Details of shipping losses are given in Appendix I. Nine ships totalling 25,592 tons were reported lost by enemy action. Of these, 6 ships(23,723 tons) were British; 4 ships (15,582 tons) were sunk by U-Boats; 3 ships(8,603 tons) by mine and 2 ships (1,744 tons) by aircraft.12: During air raids on Liverpool on the nights of the 20th and21st December three ships were sunk in the docks and ten damaged. At dusk onthe 23rd two Fokker-Wolf four-engined bombers attacked shipping lying off the convoy assembly port of Oban, with the result that one ship was sunk, three were damaged and a drifter damaged and beached.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending noon Wednesday, the 25th December, 785 ships,including 145 allied and 16 neutral, were convoyed, but no ships were reported lost. Two battleships, two aircraft carriers, three cruisers, ten armed merchant cruisers, 55 destroyers, 13 sloops and 29 corvettes were employed in escort duties.,;: Since the beginning of the war 207 ships including 23 allied and 16 neutral,have been lost out of 48,066, including 5,255 allied and 4,237 neutral, which havebeen convoyed, or one in 232.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the21st December totalled 792,710 tons compared with 904,673 tons during theprevious week and an average of 802,567 for the previous ten weeks. Twelvetankers brought 114,416 tons of oil of various grades. Mineral imports were190,140 of which 116,154 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore.Timber imports were 73,157 tons and cereal imports were 178,560 tons. other food imports totalled 51,600 tons of which 10,013 tons were sugar, 11,437 tons were meat and 3,768 tons were tea.British Minelaying.14. H.M.S. Adventure laid 280 mines in the St. George&apos;s Channel on the20th December and a further 280 on the 23rd December. There has been someminelaying by aircraft off the French Channel and Atlantic ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Mines weeping.% 15. Enemy aircraft laid mines in the Thames Estuary and in the Merseyon&apos;three nights during last week. In consequence, the Thames was closed for48 hours and the Mersey for 26 hours.
Six acoustic and seven magnetic mines have been exploded during the week.Jive contact mines and eight explosive Cutters have been swept off Dover. Inthe Thames Estuary, east of Longsand Head, Paddle Minesweepers cut aGerman X type mine which appeared to have been recently laid.; The mine totals to date are, magnetic 827, contact 767, acoustic 105.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German- .Air reconnaissance of Bremerhaven on the 2lst December showed that theBremen was in dry dock and the Europa was alongside the Colombus Quay.The Trapani, 1,855 tons, was at Genoa on the 19th December considerablydamaged. The Duisberg, 7,389 tons, reported to Leghorn on the 19th december that she had been twice hit by mines when leading a convoy. The Regensburg,8 068 tons, 17 knots, sailed from Yokohama on the 20th December. She had beenthere since the outbreak of war.Italian.No important movements have been reported.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.17. German plans must have been influenced by the success of the Britishoffensive in Libya and by the situation in, Albania. This is the first occasionoh which Hitler seems to have been caught unprepared by the turn which eventshave taken. Germany&apos;s object must still be to ensure that the military threat to the Eastern Mediterranean continues, until she is in a position to accentuateit by domination of the Balkans or by an advance through Turkey and Anatolia.. Hitler, however, is likely to avoid any new commitments at the moment,and he doubtless hopes that Italy may manage to stage some sort of recovery withthe minimum of assistance. As a reinsurance against an Italian collapse hemay contemplate some measure of co-operation with France, the occupation ofthe French Mediterranean ports and possibly the seizure of Gibraltar.The occupation of the North Spanish and Portuguese ports to complete theblockade of the United Kingdom is also a strong possibility.The main object, however, must remain the defeat of Great Britain. The,air and sea blockade will probably be intensified and preparations for an invasionon an immense scale continued.The Balkan States.Greece and Albania.18. Partly due to the bad weather there have been no rapid advances duringthe week.  Greek progress has, however, continued steadily.In the Epirus sector Himara near the coast has been captured together witha considerable number of prisoners, including a black shirt battalion.- This townwas an important centre of Italian resistance.Bidgaria.19. In addition to the 1938 class it is believed that about 20,000 reservists,mainly infantry, cavalry and artillery (except anti-aircraft and coast defence),have been released, making the total number with the colours rather less than200,000. Most of the troops on the Greek frontier have returned to their peacestations.:, .Reports from various quarters all tend to show that, as a result of the concentration of troops in the south and south-east, the morale of the armed forces and of the Trudovaks (labour corps) has deteriorated very considerably.The severe weather conditions have undoubtedly contributed and there is muchsickness among the troops, particularly reservists. The attitude of. officers,especially junior officers, to reservists and Trudovaks has become extremely
Prussian and this together with bad living conditions has led to open disaffection.These reports of bad morale and disaffection do not indicate an imminent revolt,but should be read as the normal reactions of Balkan troops to such conditions.In spite of more than a foot of snow the Lufthansa line is operatingregularly from Bojourishte (near Sofia). The weather remains dry and thereforemost of the main air bases are probably serviceable.Yugoslavia.20. Severe cold has been experienced at Belgrade and ice is forming on the danube. If present conditions continue, traffic on the river must soon cease.Snow has fallen and in the Slovenia and South Serbia many roads are impassable.Partly as a result of this severe weather, which makes further work ondefences impossible and an attack by land unlikely, and partly because of the changed conditions in Albania, a great many reservists have been released duringthe last two weeks and the total number of men with the colours will soon bereduced to 500,000.Africa.Egypt.21. Since the 19th December advanced elements of our forces m the western desert have penetrated to the coast some 25 miles north-west of Bardia, in Libya.The town is now surrounded by British forces, which are making preparations for its capture. Air attacks are reported on our forward troops and Sollumharbour has again been shelled.Tlhe total number of prisoners taken during the operations is now estimatedat 37,000.Sudan.22. In the Kassala sector our patrols have been active and our forwardposts repulsed an attack by an enemy company, inflicting serious casualties.East Africa.23. Further reports of the action at El Wak on the 16th December,previously referred to, now state that 100 of the enemy were killed and 120 taken prisoner, besides many dead and wounded which were removed by the retiringenemy. 13 small and 2 heavy guns, 2 L.M.g&apos;s, stores and ammunition were captured. Our casualties consisted of 2 killed and 12 wounded. With theexception of a small rear-guard the force has now returned to its location.The 5th South African Infantry Brigade arrived at Mombasa from SouthAfrica on the 16th December.  There are now 3 S.A. Infantry Brigades in Kenya.AIR SITUATION.General Review.24. The first five days of the period under review were suitable for day and night operations, but the nights of the 24th/25th and 25th/26th December-were totally unfit for operations by either side. Important attacks were madeon Berlin railways, oil plants in the Ruhr and factories in Mannheim, whileVenice was visited by aircraft from this country for the first time during the war.Enemy night attacks on this country continued during the early part of theweek. On four consecutive days heavy raids were directed against manchester and Merseyside. Daylight operations were confined mainly to reconnaissance and coastal flights.In Libya and Greece our bombers and fighters continue to exert heavy pressure on the Italians.Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent RaidAssessment Reports are given in Appendices VI and VII.
Germany and Occupied Territory.25. Bomber Command flew 6 day and 432 night sorties during the period,and Coastal Command aircraft gave strong support with 58 sorties in additionto routine reconnaissances and patrols.26. Oil plants in the Ruhr were attacked on three successive nights bystrong forces, twice in spite of bad weather. The three heavy attacks onMannheim during the previous week were followed up by two further raids onthe nights of the 22nd and 23rd December. That on the 22nd was carried outby fourteen Wellingtons in a clear sky on the snow-covered towns of Mannheimand Ludwigshaven, and results were most successful; on the following nighttwelve aircraft delivered their attack in spite of heavy cloud over the target area.27. On the night of the 20th/21st December Berlin was again attacked; onthis occasion good weather prevailed. Twenty-three aircraft dropped seventeentons of high-explosive bombs and 3,500 incendiaries on railway and industrial targets. The Friedrichstrasse, Schlesischer and Potsdamer Stations were allbombed, one aircraft reporting a. direct hit on the centre of the SchlesischerStation with a 1,000-lb. bomb dropped from 900 feet. Serious fires were causedat three goods-yards and the West Wharves, and explosions took place in thevicinity of the Hugo-Heine Aero-Engine factory. On this night 142 aircraft took part in operations and all returned safely.28. On the nights of the 19th/20th and 20th/21st a total of fifteen coastal command Blenheims successfully attacked the Bergen-Oslo Railway, and it ispossible that now it will be unusable for the remainder of the winter. In bad&apos;weather, a total of sixteen Coastal Command Blenheims attacked U-Boats at brest and Lorient on the nights of the 20th/21st and 21st/22nd. On the second of these nights three Beauforts made an attack on the battleship Tirpitz willhelmshaven and dropped mines in the target area; results were unobservedexcept that one mine was seen to explode 2,000 feet from the ground.29. Channel ports in France, Belgium and Holland were attacked on five nights during the week, and many aerodromes in Germany, Northern France,Holland and Belgium were attacked as primary as well as &apos;&apos; last resort&apos;&apos; targets,by both Bomber Command and Coastal Command aircraft. Propaganda leaflets were dropped in Germany at Mannheim, Worms, Coblenz, Trier and Hanover,and, in France, over Brittany, Lille and. Amiens.Italy.30. On the night of the 19th/20th December three Wellingtons attacked oilcisterns and railways at Brindisi, all bombs falling in the target area and causinglarge fires and subsequent explosions. These aircraft operated from Egypt,using a Greek aerodrome as advanced base. Two nights later five Wellingtonsfrom England attacked the oil refinery at Porto Marghera, near Venice. bombs were seen to burst across the target and several fires were started. This flightwas accomplished in approximately ten hours in conditions of intense cold.Great Britain.31. Fighter Command flew 569 patrols, involving 1,733 sorties, by day, and112 patrols involving 175 sorties by night.32. German daylight operations over this country were on a veryreduced scale, and confined almost entirely to reconnaissance flights, the inter-ception of which was made extremely difficult by prevailing low cloud and poorvisibility. On the 21st December the weather was finer and a large number of enemy aircraft circled over the Straits and French coast, but showed reluctance to engage our fighter patrols; no serious attack developed, though a few singlenghter-bombers dropped bombs in South London. During the rest of the week the main activity of Fighter Command was directed towards the protection ofsnipping and the interception of reconnaissance aircraft, three of which were destroyed.[22056] c
33. On each of the nights of the 20th-23ro! inclusive, German night ppera-tions were on a heavy scale and were directed mainly against the Liverpool and manchester areas, though single aircraft visited almost all districts except the West. Between 200 and 300 long-range bombers were engaged on each ofthese nights. Damage affecting the Aircraft Industry is described in the home security Section. There was no other night activity except on the 19th-20th,when about seventy enemy aircraft were engaged in a widespread attack, chieflyon the south-eastern counties, the object of which was obscure. At night sevenenemy aircraft were destroyed, three by fighters.Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying.34. Aircraft of the Coastal Command flew 198 patrols, involving 706 sorties(including 324 convoy escorts), in addition to the bombing operations already described.Photographic reconnaissances were made over many targets in Germany and occupied territories and also over ports and harbours in enemy occupation,extending from Nantes and St. Nazaire as far north as the Norwegian Coast.On the afternoon of the 20th December a Blenheim on patrol secured a direct hit on a 5,000-ton merchant vessel off Boulogne. During the week mines were laid by both Bomber Command and Coastal Command aircraft off Kiel, Flushing,Brest and Lorient.German coastal reconnaissance activity was maintained at the usual level.Malta.35. During the week reconnaissances were made of the Ionian Sea and southern Italian ports. A Glenn Martin shot down an Italian bomber in flamesover Naples Bay. Two enemy formations approached the Island on the22nd December, but withdrew before Hurricanes could intercept.Greece and Albania.36. Our bombers in Greece have maintained operations against Italian bases and lines of communications whenever weather conditions permitted, and our fighters have been constantly in action. Valona was twice bombed and hits were observed on the aerodrome, barracks and petrol dumps. On the 22nd Decembernine Blenheims attacked the oil plant at Kusove, north-east of Berat, and photo-graphs confirm that all the bombs from six of the aircraft fell in the target area.Fighter opposition was encountered; two Blenheims were shot down, and anenemy fighter was probably destroyed. Six Blenheims bombed the aerodrome atBerat on the 20th. On the 21st nine Gladiators met a formation of six Italianbombers escorted by fifty fighters over Argyrocastro. Eight and possibly elevenof the latter were shot down with the loss of two Gladiators.On Christmas Day Blenheims dropped clothing over Corfu for Greekchildren.Egypt and Libya.37. Air operations in support of our land offensive in Libya have been maintained. Enemy aerodromes and ports have been the main objectives ofour bombers, some of which have again operated from Malta against WesternLibya. Fighter patrols have covered the advance of our land forces, and have again met with considerable success in combats with enemy fighters and bombers.Between the 9th and the 22nd December the enemy have lost at least fifty-nine,and a probable further twenty, aircraft by fighter action alone, against a total loss to ourselves of fourteen aircraft.38. Our aircraft have made heavy attacks on barracks and buildings atDerna, on jetties and wharves at Tobruk, and on the port of Tripoli. On the night of the 23rd/24th December thirteen tons of bombs were dropped in the harbour district of Tripoli : a seaplane shed was burnt out and large fires were left burning. The Wellingtons engaged on this raid had the aerodrome atCastek Benito as their primary objective but, owing to poor visibility, it wasonly located by one aircraft.  An attack on this aerodrome two nights previously
resulted in the destruction of at.least nineteen aircraft and a fire which wasvisible for seventy miles. Berka aerodrome was heavily attacked on three nightsand at Benina a hangar and three aircraft were destroyed.39. The Italian Air Force has, been relatively inactive. Abortive attacks were made on Alexandria on the 19th and the 25th December. Sollum was raidedon the 24th by twenty Italian bombers escorted by fighters; the jetty.and alighter were hit, and forty military casualties were caused.Sudan and East Africa.40. There have been no outstanding incidents during the past week. On.the Sudan frontier our bombers and reconnaissance aircraft have continued theiroffensive operations and have bombed and machine-gunned enemy camps and aerodromes, particularly in the Kassala and Metemma areas. On the night of the22nd six Wellesleys bombed Burye, seventy miles south of Lake Tana, and on thefollowing day a munition dump in the same region was destroyed. Stores andan M.T. concentration at Asmara were also successfully attacked.41. Blenheims based on Aden carried out a number of bombing raids,notably on Heis, on the Somaliland Coast, and on the pumping station at Harsile,near Assab.   Fighter patrols were maintained over Aden and over Red Seaconvoys.42. * The South African Air Force has done valuable work in continuingoffensive reconnaissances in Italian Somaliland and on the Kenya-Abyssiniaborder, in the course of which aerodromes and petrol dumps have been bombed.43. The Italian Air Force has carried out a few. bombing raids in theKassala and Port Sudan areas, but no damage of importance has resulted.Air Intelligence.Italy.44. Both the Italian and German press have been mentioning a new typeof Italian aircraft which is propelled by compressed gas in place of the usualairscrew. According to the Kolnische Zeitung, Mario de Bernarcli, the famousItalian Schneider Cup pilot, has recently attained a speed of 620 m.p.h., whentesting one of these aircraft.Bulgaria.45. Bulgaria has recently received a further forty to fifty Messerschmitt 109fighters from Germany, and now possesses a total of sixty. It is believed thatthe Bulgarians have been pressing for the delivery of some Me. 110s, but theGermans have refused and it is said that the Germano-Bulgarian trade agree-ment is inoperative as a result.Japan.46. The Japanese are reported to have some 25,000 parachute troops under training.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.47. Only one incident of note occurred during daylight hours, when on the22nd two bombs were dropped on the British Aluminium Company&apos;s Works atFort William.48. The week was notable for heavy night attacks carried out during foursuccessive nights in the Liverpool and Manchester areas. The Liverpool area was strongly attacked on the night of the 20th-21st December, and an even more severe attack followed the next night, when a concentration appears to have beenmade on the Docks area. On the night 22nd-23rd, some bombs were again dropped in Liverpool, Bootle and Birkenhead.
49. A severe attack was developed against the Manchester district on the night of the 22nd-23rd, and again, though in a less severe form, on the following night. A large number of incendiary bombs were dropped and severe fires were caused.Damage.Liverpool.50. (a) Docks. Damage to warehouses and storage sheds at the Docks hasbeen serious, with considerable losses the latest estimate of which has not as yetbeen made of tobacco, cotton and timber.Substantial damage to shipping has also been reported, two ships beingsunk and ten others damaged. Although nine docks suffered various degrees of damage and seventeen berths are stated to be out of commission, it is reportedthat, generally speaking, the working of the Port has not been seriously affected.(b) Industry. Serious damage was done to food-factories, productionbeing stopped at Spiller&apos;s Flour Mills and Paul Bros. Flour Mills, both at Birken-head, while Hutehinson&apos;s Flour Mills were also damaged. Considerable damage was also done at Tate and Lyle&apos;s sugar refinery.Seven other key points, including the Wallasey Gas Works, were hit, but no serious damage resulted.(c) Public Services. Damage to main services was considerable, electricityin particular suffering by a fire at the Highfield Street sub-station.(d) Communications. Altogether 15 hits were registered in the railway system, the cumulative effect of which reacted seriously on the working of thelines, while tranrvray services and road traffic were badly dislocated, particularlyin the centre of the city.Manchester.51. (a) Industry. It has not as yet proved possible to assess in detail the degree of industrial damage in the Manchester area suffered on the nights22nd-23rd and 23rd-24th December, but it is now known to be not so severe as was at first thought.The main damage occurred in the south and centre of the city, and particu-larly at Trafford Park. Some twenty-four important factories were affected,among them Metropolitan Vickers and Dunlops Rubber; although a part of theformer works was severely damaged, the aircraft section was not seriously affected; and at the latter the amount of rubber lost was small. Two oil cisternsof the Anglo-American Oil Company were gutted, but several other tanks in thevicinity have been saved.(b) Food. Two thousand tons of meat in cold storage have been lost, andit is estimated that a considerable quantity of grain has been destroyed.(c) Communications. Some damage to railways was caused on the night ofthe 22nd/23rd and the London Road, Victoria, and Exchange Stations were temporarily closed to passenger traffic, but the greater part of the railwaydisorganisation which on the 25th was still reported as considerable was caused by unexploded bombs and mines.(d) Public Services. The damage was not serious, electricity and sewerageworks being practically unaffected. Some reduction of gas supplies was caused inStretford, but repair work is proceeding quickly.Elsewhere.52. Altogether eight key-points were hit in the rest of the country but.except for the incident at the British Aluminium Works previously mentionedwhere minor damage was caused, none calls for special remark.On the night of the 21st/22nd December the Central Signal Box betweenEbury and Elizabeth bridges near Victoria Station was demolished by either a mine or a very large bomb. Considerable and very widespread damage resulted.(See para. 56.)Service Property.53. Some damage was done to Portsmouth Dockyard on the night of the23rd/24th December (see Naval Situation) and some casualties were caused.
Civilian Casualties.54. For the week ending 0600 on the 25th December the approximate figures are 605 killed and 2.800 injured and include :-SeriouslyKilled.       injured.Manchester and Salford, 22nd/23rd and 23rd/24th      122 439These casualties total  -06 per cent, of thepopulation (1937).Liverpool, Wallasey, Birkenhead, Bootle, 20th / 21stand 21st/22nd    ...      ......      ......      345 326totalling -07 per cent, of the population(1937).Unexploded Bombs and Mines.55. The total outstanding for disposal has been reduced from 2,104 to1,753. It appears that over 30 per cent, of the U.X.B&apos;s noted during the weekwere dropped in the Liverpool and Manchester areas.Out of 40 parachute mines dropped in and around Manchester 18 or possibly19 did not explode.  Eleven have since been rendered safe.Certain unignited incendiary bombs dropped in East Anglia on the 21st and22nd December have been identified as Italian 20 kg. bombs.Note on Large German Bombs.56. So far very few German bombs weighing more than 1,000 kg. have beenreported.
