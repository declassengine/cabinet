THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1940.SECRET. CoPy No-W.P. (40) 482.December 23, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE &quot;DAILY WORKER.&quot;Memorandum by the Home Secretary.IN accordance with the request of the War Cabinet, I submit for their consideration the following note with regard to the Daily Worker. I gathered that it was the desire of my colleagues that an objective statement of the prosand cons should be circulated.Previous Consideration.1. When the matter was considered by the War Cabinet in July(W.M. (40) 194, item 10), it was decided that a preliminary warning shouldbe given to the Daily Worker, but that at that time no order should be madeprohibiting its publication. A letter was sent by my predecessor saying thatthe suppression of a newspaper is a step which any Secretary of State would desire if possible to avoid, even in time of grave national emergency,&quot; drawing attention to Defence Regulation 2D, which authorises the suppression of a news-paper on the ground of a systematic publication of matter calculated to fomentopposition to the prosecution of the war, and expressing the hope that the paper would be so conducted in future that it would not be necessary to take action under this Regulation. After that warning there was for a time some modifica-tion of the tone of the paper, but there was no real modification of its policy,and recent issues, generally speaking, have been as bad as those which precededthe warning.Poivers of Secretary of State.2. The powers of the Home Secretary to deal with anti-war propagandaare contained in Defence Regulations 2C and 2D. Defence Regulation 2C,which was made at the end of April after discussion with representative Membersof the House of Commons, contains various provisions designed to limit executive action. A warning notice*&apos; must be served and this warning notice must draw attention to the matter objected to. If after the notice there is a repetition ofthe offence, there may, with the consent of the Attorney-General, be a prosecution.If the prosecution is successful, the Secretary of State may, by order under defence Regulation 94A, take possession of any printing press controlled by the* The letter sent in -July was not a warning notice within the meaning of Regulation 2C[22041] B
person convicted and used for the production, of, the publication in respect ofwhich he was convicted.At the end of May 1940 it was decided that a swifter and more drasticprocedure might be required, and Regulation 2D was made empowering the.Home Secretary to issue an order prohibiting the publication of any newspaperif he is satisfied that in such newspaper there is a systematic publication ofmatter which is, in the opinion of the Home Secretary, calculated to. fomentopposition to the prosecution to a successful issue of the war. At the same time,Regulation 94B was introduced, which enables the Secretary of State to seizeany printing press used for the production of such a newspaper.If any action were to be taken against the Daily Worker, the most effectivecourse would be by an order for its suppression under Regulation 2D. procedure under Regulation 2C would be a long-drawn-out process, giving the paper a good opportunity for propaganda against what it would describe as the Governmentseffort to &quot;gag&quot; the Press. The first step would have to be a warningparticularising the articles to which objection is taken. To particularise certain articles would be unsatisfactory because the main objection to the Daily Workerlies not in particular articles, but in its continuous policy. The difference betweenthe Daily Worker and other newspapers which attack or misrepresent the war policy of the Government lies in the fact that in these other papers such attacks and misrepresentations are what may be called ad hoc stories in journals whichencourage the reader to assist in the prosecution of the war, while in the daily worker there is never a note of real encouragement.Case for Suppression.3. Since October 1939, when the Communist Party of Great Britain, whichhad previously been advocating resistance to Nazi aggression, changed its policyovernight and decided to represent the war as a contest between rival capitalistor imperialist powers, the Daily Worker has done all that is possible to hinderthe national war effort short of open and frank incitement to obstruct that effort.While it has carefully avoided any such direct incitement, it has striven to createin the reader a state of mind in which he will be unlikely to be keen to assistthe war effort, and indeed, possibly, likely whenever an opportunity arises to frustrate that effort.The line taken by the paper is that the war is being waged by the&apos;&apos; capitalists &apos;&apos; for the purpose of securing benefit for themselves and robbing theworkers of such rights and privileges as they have been able to obtain under peace-time conditions; that the special powers conferred by the Emergency Powers Actswere designed and are being used for the destruction of democratic liberties andthe impairment of trade union practices and measures for the protection of theworking classes; that the &quot; governing class &quot;are entirely callous to the sufferingsof the poorer people under war conditions and are securing for themselvesmeasures of safety and comfort which are denied to their poorer fellow citizens.The Daily Worker has maintained that the Government is deliberatelyrefraining from providing proper (deep or bomb-proof) shelters for the workers:and it has emphasised, exaggerated and misrepresented any alleged defects in theCivil Defence organisation for the purpose of showing that the Government areindifferent to sufferings and hardships of the &quot; people.&quot; The &quot; spotter &quot; system for factories has been represented as a device for securing that the workers shallgo on earning profits for the employers at the risk of their lives. The scheme for sending children overseas was represented as a scheme for providing safety forthe families of the well-to-do. Stories about the Government&apos;s indifference to the sufferings of the homeless are frequent in the paper. Attempts are made toshow that the food policy is full of inequalities and designed to ensure that anyshortage of food shall be felt by the poorer people only.In a recent issue, after the air attack at Birmingham, there was a largeheadline &quot;Bombed City Monument to Government Callousness.&quot; The PrimeMinisters words about &quot;blood and tears&quot; have been frequently quoted as showing that suffering is all that the &quot; people &quot; can expect from the continuanceof the war. In the leading article of the 28th October, it was said that the onlyissue which concerns the &quot; workers &quot; is &quot;to find the way out of this blood andfilth. They know that the war becomes more horrible every day, that the bombing of the big cities is only in its trial stages and that poison gas and disease mayfollow at any moment.&quot;
It is frequently hinted that victory is improbable. In the leading article ofthe 13th December, the following passage occurs : &quot;With the aid-and only with the aid of this great flood of armsand money, sold or lent at great profit by Wall Street, the British ImperialistGovernment can perhaps keep up right into 1942 its struggle with theGerman Imperialist Government.&quot;The Daily Worker seizes every opportunity to give prominence to wagedisputes and to emphasise the right to strike. It also tries to provoke discontentby stories of unsatisfactory working conditions, unsatisfactory provision for thehousing of workers, transport difficulties and so on.Prominence has been given to any news about opposition in the United states to the co-operation of the United States Government with the Allied Cause, andthe line taken has been that American &quot; capitalists &quot; are hoping to extend thewar merely in order that they may make more profits. In a leading article Ofthe 8th November on the re-election of Mr. Roosevelt the following passagesoccur : &quot;Our Tory-Labour rulers want to extend the war around the earth.They want to see more bombs crashing on to the working-class homes of rome, Milan, Naples; .... they want to have the American workersdragged into this affair, because in that way the British &apos; empire-carvers &apos;. will get a lot more money on credit, a lot more war machines, and perhaps. a lot of men to help make the world safe for Wall Street and the City ofLondon. .... The Bosses of Washington and Wall Street, allied withthe Bosses of Whitehall and the City, will together attack the workers ofboth Britain and the United States in the interests of their war. It is forus to do our part, as our American comrades will do theirs, in defeating theBosses, each on our own section of that great international front.&quot;The entry of Greece into the war was represented as a step taken undercapitalist and Fascist influence to expose the people of Greece to suffering and loss of life.The articles about India and the colonies are designed to suggest that thenative peoples have nothing to gain from a war waged by a capitalist andimperialist Government, which wishes to exploit, them. There was a recent articleabout the position of the French Colonial Empire headed : &apos;&apos; Nazi Frying-Pan British Fire or Freedom %&apos;&apos; The theme of the article was that the Britishimperialists were trying to dismember the French Colonial Empire, and thatthe &apos;&apos; masses of the people in the French Colonial possessions desire freedom from foreign rule and will see no advantage in substituting the rule of de Gaulle,supported by British Imperialism, for that of Vichy collaborating with GermanImperialism.&quot;While the Daily Worker defended the pact of friendship between theU.S.S.R. and Germany, and does at times manifest some degree of sympathy withthe German case, it cannot be charged with propaganda which is directlypro-Nazi, although its arguments at times bear resemblance to Nazi anti-british propaganda. It sometimes exalts the struggles of the German &apos;&apos; people &apos;&apos; againstthe Nazi regime, and reiterates the view that, if the present British Governmentwere replaced by a &quot; people&apos;s &quot; Government, the British &quot;people,&quot; in alliance with the Russian &quot;people&quot; and the &quot;people&quot; of Germany, would bring thewar to an end.It is an essential part of the Communist policy that success is to be achieved,when an opportunity presents itelf, by methods of violence, but, generallyspeaking, the Party propagandists avoid language which can be made the basisof a charge of incitement to violence. An example of their methods may befound in a recent issue of the Daily Worker, in which, under the heading&quot;Advertisers&apos; Announcement,&quot; there was a notice of a book on the history ofthe Russian Revolution. This so-oalled &quot; Advertisers&apos; Announcement &quot; consisted of a paragraph about the seizure by the Bolsheviks in 1917 of large quantities ofarms from the Army stores. At the head of the quoted paragraph were printedthe words &quot; Workers seize Arms,&quot; and at the bottom the words &quot; the workers of moscow knew what they wanted : read how they came into power.&quot;[22041] b 2
v Whether in relation to its campaigns against the Labour movement or against the Government, the paper&apos;s purpose;appears to be the promotion ofconfusion. &quot;. Through chaos to triumph &quot; might well be the slogan of BritishCommunism as of German Nazism.Effect On the Nation&apos;s Morale.4. It can be argued with much force that propaganda of this kind ought not to be allowed in time of war, and a contrast can be drawn between the Govern-rnent&apos;s attitude of toleration towards the Communist Party and the attitude, taken towards the Fascist Party. The daily reiteration of Communist propaganda is calculated to have a bad effect upon the morale of the people, especially throughoutthe coming months when the strain on the civilian population may be severe. &apos;&apos;In fact, however, little or no evidence can be found that communist propaganda is having any appreciable effect on the morale of the country as awhole, although it may not be without some effect in certain factories. the circulation of the Daily Worker, I am advised, has not been increasing butdecreasing. Even in the towns and districts which have suffered most severelyfrom air bombardment the spirit of the people is still firm and high. Amongstthe workers in the factories, despite the strain of long hours and despite all theefforts of the Communists to magnify the causes of industrial discontent, thespirit is still on the whole good. While; therefore, there is clearly a risk in allowing this Communist propaganda to continue, there is no evidence that as yet its effect is marked. The effect of much of the propaganda is no doubtimpaired by its violence and obviously tendentious character. Few, except thosewho have already swallowed the Communist doctrines, are likely to be persuadedby it, even though some may for a time be deceived by it. The main risk lies inthe preparation that is being made to cause the maximum amount of ill-feelingif and when circumstances become more difficult. It must also be recognized thatbeneath the public propaganda there is secret propaganda being carried on by communist agents in industry.Case against Suppression.5. In these circumstances the question arises whether the case, from theviewpoint of the public interest, for the suppression of the Daily Worker is suchas to outweigh the disadvantages of that course. The disadvantages may besummarised as follows :   -(a) There has been relatively little agitation either in the Press or elsewherefor the suppression of Communist propaganda. Although none of theother papers takes much interest in the Daily Worker or would mournits disappearance, the Press is at the present time very sensitive tothe danger of Government interference, and if action were taken forthe suppression of the Daily Worker such action would probably be, the subject of unfavourable comment in a number of papers.(b) Suppression of the paper might rally to the side of the Communistssome persons who are loyal supporters of the war effort, but areapprehensive about any curtailment of liberty for the expression ofopinion. The Government would be charged with forgetting the viewheld by some that the suppression of opposition views was one of the causes of the downfall of France.(c) Account must be taken of the effect on public opinion outside this countryand particularly in the United States. Many people who have neverread the Daily Worker would regard the suppression of a newspaperas a striking departure from the traditional British policy of preserving the liberty of the Press. The recent Debate in parliament on a Motion in favour of a peace move is said to have been cited inAmerica with approbation as showing that the principles of libertyand democracy in this country are preserved even under the stress ofwar. The suppression of a newspaper would probably be used byopponents as showing that the British are fighting for nationalisticgains rather than for principles of liberty.Repercussions.6. A decision to suppress the Daily Worker should not be taken withoutconsidering what further action is to be taken against Communist propaganda.
sThere are other Communist periodicals, including, for example, the Week, aroneoed sheet published by Claud Cockburn, alias Frank Pitcairn, one of theprincipal journalists of the Daily Worker. This sheet advocates the same views as the Daily Worker in a style which has a less popular and more &quot; intellectual &quot;appeal. If the Daily Worker is suppressed, the Week should be suppressed atthe same time.There are numerous pamphlets issued by. the Communist Party, and the suppression of the Daily Worker will no doubt be followed by a multiplicationof such pamphlets. The suppression of such pamphlets would be a more difficult matter than the suppression of a daily paper.Many speeches are made by Communists in which the same views are expressed as those expressed in the Daily Worker.7. If a general policy of suppressing Communist propaganda were adopted the question would also arise whether action should not be taken for the suppression-sion of the Communist Party itself by interning the leaders of that party (as distinct from individuals dealt with as individuals) as was done with regard tothe leaders of the Fascist party. Such action might well be necessary if russia should definitely come down on the side of the enemy and the members of theBritish Communist Party become persons whose sympathies and associationsare &quot;hostile.&quot; But it is desirable to avoid embarking on such a policyunless and until it becomes essential on security grounds. Hitherto there has been no evidence that it is the policy of the Communist Party to engage in overt and direct attempts to frustrate the war effort by sabotage or by refusal to handlemunitions.Issues for Decision.8. In my view, there is sufficient ground for action under Defence Regula-tion 2D. I am satisfied that there is in the Daily Worker and in the V/eek &apos;&apos; a systematic publication of matter which is calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution to a successful issue &quot; of the war.The questions for consideration are whether the suppression of these paperswill bring such practical benefit to the successful prosecution of the war as to outweigh the disadvantages (including the possible repercussions of such action),and whether the present time is the right moment at which to take action.H.
