4. Morale. Reports indicate steady improvement in discipline and morale.All six of tlhe vessels already operating in home waters have been reported as&quot;very efficient.&quot; Seven vessels are operating abroad; in one of these disciplineis not yet satisfactory, and there is still room for considerable improvement invarious quarters.5. The recent successes at Taranfo and in Greece have helped to produce ageneral atmosphere of optimism.6. General de Gaulle and Admiral Muselier are both loyally supported bythe men in the Free French Forces.7. The fact that the F.N.F.L. is not quite so well paid as the Royal Navyremains a cause for some resentment.8. Recruiting has slowed up considerably since ships arrived to repatriatethe French in oamps. The small flow of transfers from the R.N. to tihe F.F.F.continues and volunteers from abroad arrive from time to time.9. Evidence gathered from intercepted letters indicate that the standardof morale is high.French Officers and Men in the Royal Navy.10. There are now 567 Frenchmen in the Royal Navy. The majority ofthem are now at sea, mostly in French ships taken over by us.11. Morale is generally very good. Discipline is improving, though stillsomewhat below our standards.12. There is no change in the feeling of contempt for the Vichy Government.Slight interest is taken in General de Gaulle&apos;s operations; the General himselfappears to be regarded with respect. The R.N. French are whole-heartedly loyalto us and confident of victory; they regard themselves as British in every way.French in Camps.13. 7,200 officers and men of the French Navy and Mercantile Marine wererepatriated during November. The remainder, some 260 merchant seamen, anda few odd Naval and military ratings will be repatriated in about a week&apos;s time.14. After some initial confusion when the camps were first formed, officersand men have been living in conditions of very reasonable comfort with good pay,good food and plenty of liberty. Complaints by a few hostile officers have,however, continued and would have continued whatever the circumstances.15. The two following statements were sent quite voluntarily by a priestand a doctor who have since been repatriated : (a) &quot; From the material point of view I have had nothing at all to complainof during my stay in England; I have been well housed and fed sincetlhe 3rd August; apart from some restriction of movement, I cannotsay that I have been treated as a prisoner of war.&quot;ip) &quot;I declare that during my duty as senior medical officer, the ship&apos;scompany of the Surcouf has lived in good, hygienic conditions. Theywere not treated as prisoners of war.&quot;(ii) Army.16.   Strength. Camberley officers other Ranks.43721Foreign LegionRemainder ...561Equipment.

Employment. Normal training has taken place, including route marches.Tank units have been given instruction in the driving of all vehicles.Welfare. The provision of an institute, to be ready by Christmas, has hada very good effect.(iii) Air Force.17. The R.A.F. Franco-Belgian Air Training School at Odiham is now infull operation with a full establishment of pupils. In the first week of flying training, in spite of bad weather conditions, 180 hours were flown.Fifteen Free French pilots are serving in R.A.F. Fighter squadrons, and thedestruction of two enemy aircraft has been credited to them during the month.B. POLES.(i) Navy.18. Consistently good reports continue to be received of the morale,,discipline, efficiency and conduct of the Poles.19. Some recent reports have indicated the attitude of the Poles to othercountries and Governments to be as follows :-Great Britain. Marked friendliness and admiration, particularly forthe Prime Minister.France. A poor opinion of the French in general.Germany. Intense hatred.Russia. Attitude is by no means as unfriendly as might be expected.Polish Government. No indications of enthusiasm, but respect forGeneral Sikorski is increasing.20. There has been a long delay in settling the rates of pay of the officersand men of the Polish Navy. The question is a difficult one, as, when concessionsare made to one Ally, the other Allies apply for similar concessions, and thisaffects not only one Service, but all three. So far, the Committee dealing withthis question has been disinclined to allow increments for former service in thePolish Navy. The Polish Admiral has felt very strongly about this and, as, after careful consideration, his attitude is considered fair and reasonable, theAdmiralty have decided in his favour, and it is hoped that the matter will shortly be satisfactorily settled in committee.(ii) Army.21.   Strength.-Kinross : 4,348 Officers, 13,306 Other Ranks.Accommodation. Minor difficulties of overcrowding in the Fife and Angussector are being overcome.

(i) Navy.25. Morale and discipline continue to be very good and there is little freshto report. Some complaints, previously reported, about certain administrative arrangements of the Dutch Admiralty are now believed to have been satisfactorily settled.26. The Dutch attach very great importance to correspondence with their families in Holland. This is now going on as well as can be expected for theDutch Navy, but the Dutch tugs in Admiralty service have complained aboutdelays in censorship, and have asked for their correspondence to be treated inthe same way as that of the Dutch Navy. This is under review and can probablybe done.(ii) Army.27. Strength. Congleton : 65 Officers, 1,449 Other Ranks. Including7 Officers and 146 Other Ranks at St. A than.Accommodation. Satisfactory.

A considerable number of Norwegians are under training in Britishestablishments; very good reports are received of these men, and it is obviousthat they benefit in every way from this training.33. 128 Norwegians have been or are being trained in H.M.S. Royal Arthur.They have done well, and the Norwegian Admiral, who recently visited the camp,was very pleased with their progress. Further contingents are expected later.On completion of the training, the men are returned to the Norwegian Navy.34. The Norwegians hope shortly to man 3 ex-U.S. destroyers and 4 mine-layers.
