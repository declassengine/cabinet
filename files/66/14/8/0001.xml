ICabinet War Room
naval SITUATION.General Review.A heavy gale has persisted throughout the week&apos;in the North Atlanticcausing damage to His Majesty&apos;s ships and merchant shipping.Losses to merchant shipping due to enemy action have been below the recent&apos;average, and minelaying by enemy aircraft has continued to be on a reduced scaleNaval forces have bombarded Italian positions in Libya in support of themilitary operations in the Western Desert.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. Weather damage has been sustained by six destroyers while on escortduty in the North Atlantic, but all have arrived in harbour. A considerablenumber of distress signals were received from merchant shipping, reports fromnineteen vessels being received on the 5th December. Only two ships, however,of a convoy of twenty-eight ships from Halifax which passed through the galezone are still overdue.3. H.M. Canadian destroyer St. Croix, on passage to the Clyde fromHalifax with the Canadian destroyers Niagara and St. Clair, has been forced to turn back to Halifax. The two latter have arrived in the Clyde, which bringsthe total of Town class destroyers now in Home Waters: to thirty-two. In Tober-mory two corvettes jand an A/S Trawler were.driven ashore by the gale but have since been refloated. H.M. Submarine Unbeaten went aground after breakingadrift from H.M.S. Titania, her depot ship, but has also been refloated withoutdamage.   Slight damage was also caused to minor war vessels in Harwich.4. On the 7th December two of H.M. Trawlers were sunk as the result ofcollision off the Humber, and on the 9th December H.M. Armed Merchant CruiserDunnottar Castle received structural damage in collision with a merchant vesseloff Malin Head.  Both ships returned to harbour, for repairs.5. H.M. Destroyer Windsor had her engines disabled by mine off Orfordnesson the 8th December and was towed to Harwich by H.M. Destroyer Garth. Oneof H.M. Trawlers was also damaged by mine off Sheerness.6. H.M. Submarine Sunfish on her return from patrol off Stadtlandet on theNorwegian Coast has reported having sunk a 4,000-ton merchant vessel on the5th December and having obtained one probable hit on a 4,000-ton tanker on the7th December.7. In an enemy air attack on Portsmouth, p.m. on the 5th December, H.M.Destroyer Cameron, which was in dock, received a direct hit which set her oil fuel on fire. Some casualties were sustained and she is probably a total loss. a building in H.M.S. Vernon (Naval Shore Establishment) was also burnt out,casualties being one killed and 28 injured.Mediterranean.8. During the week convoys between Alexandria and the Piraeus, escorted by destroyers and covered by cruisers, have proceeded unmolested9. During the night of the 8th-9th December, H.M. Monitor Terror andHM. Gunboat Aphis successfully bombarded Maktiia camp (Libya), and H.M.Gunboat Ladybird bombarded Sidi Barrani in support of the military operations.R.A.F. and Naval aircraft co-operated with bombs and flares.10. On the night of the llth-12th December, Terror, Aphis and Ladybird,with four destroyers, bombarded Sollum, harassing the enemy&apos;s retirement.11. On the 9th December HM. Submarine Regulus was three days overduefrom her patrol in the Gulf of Otranto and the Adriatic, and must be presumed lost.12. French merchant ships continue to pass through the Straits of Gibraltarboth east- and west-bound escorted by units of the French fleet.
13. The Spanish Government have given the two Italian submarines atTangier extension of time until the 81st December to complete repairs.Stop Press. , rA message received from Naval Attache, Madrid, on the 13th December statesthat information has been received from Tangier that the two Italian submarineshave sailed.  ^ &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;     &apos; &apos; -Other Stations.14. A further report has been received of the action between H.M. armed merchant Cruiser Carnarvon Castle and a German raider off the East Coast ofSouth America on the 5th December. The raider was sighted at 0648 and waschased. She opened fire with great accuracy 20 minutes before the CarnarvonCastle was in range. Carnarvon Castle&apos;s main aerial, fire control and communica-tions were damaged early in the action, and the raider, herself hit, turned awayunder cover of smoke. Later the raider brought her other broadside to bear ata range of 8,000 yards. Carnarvon Castle sustained 23 hits, and it is estimatedthat the raider was hit 8 times and was considerably damaged. Two torpedoeswere seen to have been fired from the raider, but both missed. She appeared tobe a vessel of about 5,000 tons with a flush deck and raised forecastle, a cruiserstern, two masts and a short funnel. Her broadside is thought to have consisted of four 5-9-inch guns and two torpedo tubes.15. Carnarvon Castle sustained 37 casualties. She proceeded to Montevideoto effect temporary repairs, where she remained for 72 hours. No furtherinformation has since been received of the raider&apos;s position. H.M.S. enterprise and H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Queen of Bermuda have been carrying out asearch.16. On the 8th December an enemy raider attacked shipping lying off Nauru(Gilbert Islands, Pacific) and subsequently made off to the eastward at high speed.British S.S. Triadic, 6,378 tons, was set on fire, and four other ships were attacked.   Full information has not yet been received.17. H.M.S. Diomede intercepted the German S.S. Idarwald, 5,035 tons,which set herself on fire and was abandoned south-east of Cape San Antonio, Cuba.18. The Dutch sloop Van Kinsbergen intercepted the German S.S. Rhein,6,031 tons, to north-westward of Key West, on the 11th December. The Rheinwas set on fire by her crew.19. On the 10th December H.M.S. Sotithampton fired at the JapaneseS.S. Yamayuri Maru (5,028 tons) at Kismayu (Italian Somaliland). results were not observed.   Enemy shore batteries returned the fire without effect.Anti-Submarine Operations.20. Two attacks on U-Boats were carried out during the week in the North-Western Approaches, one by H.M. Destroyer Harvester without result, and theother by S.S. Cardita, which claims to have obtained a direct hit by gunfire.H.M.S. Sheffield also attacked a U-Boat to the Northward of the Azores without result.Enemy Intelligence.German.21. During the period under review no intelligence has been received of theposition of German Main Units.Italian.22. Air reconnaissance of Naples on the 7th December showed one Littorio-class and one Cavour-class battleship, five cruisers and several destroyers in harbour. One cruiser and three destroyers were reported at Valona on the6th December.[22013] b
French.23. Air reconnaissance of Toulon on the 8th December showed the battleshipProvence in the port.  She was seriously damaged at Oran on the 3rd July.Submarines.24. About five German and two or three Italian submarines were operating in the North-West Approaches during the early part of the week, but towards theend of the week it is estimated that there were only three German and one or twoItalians. One German submarine has also been in the vicinity of&apos; Cape VerdeIslands, and one or two Italian submarines have been off the Azores. photographic reconnaissance showed four or five German submarines in Lorient on the6th December, and nine Italians at Bordeaux on the 11th December.Enemy Attack on Trade.Note.- The following figures give the losses which have been reported during the period covered by this Resume. They should not be confused withthe figures shown for the last week in the diagrams of shipping losses attachedat the back of the Resume, which show the actual losses for each completeweek since the outbreak of war and are only made up to midnight of Sunday-Monday of the toeek immediately preceding that covered by this Resume.Later figures are not included in the diagrams as they are likely to beunreliable, owing to delayed notifications and uncertainty regarding theresult of recent attacks.25. 19 ships totalling 78,234 tons have been reported lost by enemy action,and of these 16 ships (52,668 tons) were British. Nine British ships (44,042 tons)were sunk by U-Boats and one large Norwegian ship (18,673 tons), 3 British ships(2,392 tons) and a Belgian Trawler were sunk by mine. One British ship and aTrawler were sunk by aircraft. Thirteen ships are reported damaged by enemy action.   Full details of ships sunk and damaged are shown in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.26. During the week ending noon Wednesday, the 11th December, 795 ships,including 130 allied and 12 neutral, were convoyed, and of these three are reported lost by enemy action. One battleship, one cruiser, eleven armed merchant cruisers,43 destroyers and 30 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty.Since the commencement of hostilities 46,610 ships have been convoyed, ofwhich 200 have been lost.27. Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 6tJh December, which was marked by very bad weather, totalled 571,979 tons,compared with an average of 845,494 tons during the past ten weeks. Thirteentankers brought 126,348 tons of oil of various grades. Mineral imports were165,308 tons, of which 111,002 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore.Timber and wood pulp totalled 56,688 tons. Cereals totalled 41,225 tons. other food imports amounted to 106,930 tons, of which 21,359 tons were tinned andrefrigerated meat, bacon and hams, 26,703 tons sugar and molasses, 3,221 tonstea and 12,742 tons fruit, including a consignment of 6,528 tons of dates.British Minelaying.28. The 1st Minelaying Squadron, escorted by ELM. Arethusa and four destroyers and covered by H.M.S. Repulse, laid 2,030 mines to the eastward of iceland on the 8th December. H.M.S. Adventure laid 280 mines in the st. George&apos;s Channel area on the 7th December and a further 280 on the10th December. Swordfish of the Fleet Air Arm laid mines during the week inthe Seine Estuary and off Brest.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.December 4 to December 11.Home Waters.29. Gales have interfered with minesweeping this week. In the minefieldlaid by E-Boats off Dover during the night of the 2nd/3rd December, 5 mines
and 8 explosive cutters have been found during the week. Four sweeps have been cut by explosive cutters.30. The LL trawler Capricornus, which was fitted with S.A. gear, detonatedten acoustic mines m the Thames Estuary during the two weeks commencing the23rd November. Unfortunately, an acoustic mine detonated only 20 yards awayon the 7th December, and she was seriously damaged. She was beached in shallowwater, and it may be possible to salve her. On the night of the 5th Decembershe had detonated a magnetic mine with LL sweep at 2020 and an acoustic minewith S.A. gear at 2345.31. The casualties which have occurred in home waters this week are allattributed to acoustic mines, with one possible exception which may have beena magnetic mine.32. Minesweeping totals are as follows : magnetic mine 813, contact mine752, acoustic mine 89.33.   Four Norwegian trawlers, which are being fitted out as Oropesa mine-sweepers, will be allocated to Dundee, where they will form the 7lst M/S GroupThey will be manned by Norwegian naval crews.Foreign Waters.34. Owing to enemy mines another dangerous area has been declared at the entrance to the Adriatic North-West of Corfu. This is about 30 miles North ofthe earlier dangerous area.35. Following che recent gales a large number of mines were washed up onthe coasts of Malta and Gozo, and several exploded on the rocks. These minesprobably come from the Italian Pantelleria field, and were of two different types36. Two ships, both British, have been mined in Australian waters duringthe week. S.S. Nimbin was sunk about 43 miles North of Sydney, andS.S. Hertford, which reached harbour, struck a mine off Spencer Gulf, SouthAustralia. There are now five separate areas in which mines have been found in australian waters since the 30th November.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.37. It is reported that the Anneliese Essberger, 5,173 tons, which is at Kobe,and the Augsburg, 6,512 tons, which left Dairen on the 6th December leaving herGerman crew on shore, have been sold to Japan. The tanker Germania, 9,851tons, which arrived at Las Pahnas (Canaries) from the Azores on the28th November, was being refuelled from the Charlotte Schlieman on the4th December. About forty Germans of seafaring type arrived at Las Palmasby air on the 3rd December. It is probable that they have manned the Madrid,8,777 tons, which sailed to the northward on the 11th December.Italian.38. An air reconnaissance of Kismayu (Italian Somalilancl) on the6th December showed fourteen merchant ships in harbour.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.Distribution of German Divisions.39. Four German divisions have lately been identified for the first time,bringing the total of identified divisions to 217. In the last fortnight a movement from the Baltic Coast and Central Germany towards South-Eastern Europeappears to have taken place. The total of divisions in Austria is believed to havebeen increased by two, probably in the Klagenfurt area, while in Slovakia and the
Protectorate there is believed to have been an increase of one division in eachcase.  The position is, therefore, thought to be as follows : -*-r--,-r--^-&apos;_Area.	Cav.	Armd.	Mot.*	Inf.

Heavy snowstorms and strong Italian resistance have slowed down the advance in the Pogradets region, where Greek troops have now reached Kalivacon the upper Skumbi, about four miles west of Pogradets.On tne rest of the front the Greek advance has been much more rapid.Argyrocastro and the port of Sarende (Santi Quaranta) have been taken, and greek forces have penetrated to within eight miles of Kelcyre and to Pigerras onthe coast.Dodecanese Islands.41. Reports are still being received of food shortage and indifferent moralein the Dodecanese Islands.Hungary.42. Though the Hungarian Army cannot yet be described as first-class, it iskeen, hardworking and patriotic. Mechanisation, including A.F.Vs. and artillery, is increasing its efficiency rapidly. A.F.Vs. include light and mediumtanks, the latter possibly 18 tons. Transylvanian territory appears to have beenutilised to the full for training in mobile warfare.Roumania.43. The construction of a new oil pipe-line from Bucharest to Giurgiu, inaddition to that already existing, is reported. Of the total distance of about80 kilometres, 20 kilometres south of Bucharest and 10 kilometres north ofGiurgiu are stated to have been partially completed.Yugoslavia.4:4:. Though the Yugoslavs do not anticipate an attack by Germany, theArmy is still maintained at a figure of some 750,000, consisting of 23 infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions.Bulgaria.45.   The army is now distributed as follows : - \North and North-Eastern Bulgaria Two infantry divisionsWestern Bulgaria ...      ...      ... Two infantry divisionsSouthern     Bulgaria      (towards Three infantry and one mobile divisionGreece)South-Eastern Bulgaria (towards Six or seven infantry and one mobileTurkey) division,making a total of 13 to 14 infantry and two mobile divisions.
Mediterranean.Malta.46.   The following arrived at Malta on the 30th November : -Twenty-four 25-pdr. guns and full scale of vehicles for 12th Fd.Regiment.Four &quot; I &quot; and two Light tanks for Independent Troop, R.T.R.Twenty-four 3 - 7-inch A.A. guns and sixteen Bofors.Vehicles fdr 4th Buffs.Middle East.Egypt.47. On the night of the 7th December forces in the Western Desert com-menced preliminary moves against Italian forces in the area Sidi BarranL-Maktila-Summar-Nibeiwa. British troops engaged were the 7th armoured division, the 4th Indian Division and some units from the Mersa Matruhgarrison. ; -48. The Italian troops in the forward area, that is in Sollum and to theEast of it, numbered some 32,000 white and 17,000 native Libyan troops, with about 148 guns and 200 light and medium tanks.49. By the evening of the 10th December 6,000 prisoners were reported tohave been taken, and the Italian General Maletti was killed in action. Fromreports received up to 0900 hours, the 11th December, camps at Nibeiwa,Tummar, Maktila and Sidi Barrani had been captured by units of the 4th indian division, 4th Armoured Brigade and Mersa Matruh force. The 4th armoured brigade then moved westwards, and it is reported that isolated parties of theenemy are still holding out east of Sidi Barrani. Over 7,000 prisoners havealready reached Mersa Matruh, and large numbers are still in the forward area.Three Generals were captured at Sidi Barrani, but no estimate can yet be madeof captured material.50. Our casualties are believed to be small, and by the evening of the10th December, the 4th Indian Division had only reported 150 wounded as requiring evacuation.Sudan.51. Our artillery and patrols continue to harass the enemy in the Kassalasector.Italian East A frica.52. Rebel activity in Italian East Africa is greatly on the increase and iscontaining a large number of Colonial troops.Far East.China.53. Numerous reports have been received of Japanese troop concentrationsin the Hainan and Canton areas, the implication being that these moves arepreparatory to a general southward drive. It is now reliably reported that these reports are baseless, and that though some minor troop movements and reliefs mayhave taken place, they are of no immediate operational significance.54. It is probable that the Chinese are deliberately spreading these storieswith a view to accelerating co-operation with ourselves and America.AIR SITUATION.General Review.55. Storms and bad visibility affected the scale of our operations duringthe past week, but whenever weather conditions permitted concentrated bombing attacks were carried out against military objectives in the Ruhr and against docks and aerodromes in occupied territory.[22013] c
Enemy operations over this country have been on a reduced&apos;scale. TheGerman Air Force continues to be employed on a policy of concentrated attacks on industrial areas with an occasional heavy attack on London. It now appearsto have been decided that two or three consecutive attacks against given areas inuncertain weather conditions are not so effective or economical as a single large-scale attack when good conditions prevail. The adoption of this policy has probably been necessitated by the heavy losses suffered due to aircraft operating in indifferent weather conditions.Our air forces in Egypt have supported the military forces operating in theWestern Desert and, by establishing air superiority over the enemy, have contributed to the great success of these operations. In Greece, although weather conditions have restricted operations, our aircraft have continued to attack theport of Valona and retreating enemy columns.Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent RaidAssessment Reports are given in Appendices V and VI.Germany and Occupied Territory.56. During the week 13 day and 334 night sorties were flown by bomber command, and 57 night bombing sorties by Coastal Command. adverse weather conditions have continued to restrict our air operations, but whenconditions have been favourable our night bombers have reported some notablyeffective results, particularly at Dusseldorf and Bordeaux. At the former, whichwas the main target on two nights, strong forces bombed blast furnaces, gas and armament works, marshalling yards and the inland port, the resultant firescovered a considerable area. At Bordeaux the main weight of attack, delivered by heavy bombers, was supported by aircraft of Coastal Command. About thirtytons of bombs were released, many of which burst on and around the Docks and among submarines, some of which may have received direct hits. The Lock.Entrance Gates are also believed to have been hit.57. On three nights more than thirty night-bomber aerodromes in enemy-occupied territory were successfully attacked, and continued pressure was exertedagainst the Channel Ports, Brest and Lorient. Six Beauforts of coastal command, detailed to attack the aircraft depot ship Friesenland in Dock at Brest,scored a direct hit on the Power Station and several on railway sidings.58. On other nights, owing to adverse conditions, few aircraft succeeded inlocating their primary targets, but secondary targets were bombed with some success.Great Britain.59. Fighter Command flew 593 patrols, involving 2,204 sorties by day and295 sorties by night. In addition, Hampdens of Bomber Command flew anumber of defensive night patrols. These figures show a further decrease by day and a considerable increase by night.60. Enemy daylight reconnaissance activity was maintained on a scalesimilar to that of the previous week, but the policy of making sparing use of fighters was continued and offensive fighter sweeps took place on only two days.On one of these, thirteen M.E. 109&apos;s were destroyed with three others probably destroyed, against a loss to ourselves of only two fighters, from one of which the pilot was saved.61. The enemy&apos;s night operations have been considerably hampered byadverse weather conditions over bases in occupied territory. On one nightthe whole country was clear, whilst on two other nights only very few aircraft were employed. During the week, however, very heavy attacks involving nearly400 aircraft in each instance have been made against London and the dock area and against Birmingham and the Midlands. Concentrated attacks have also beenmade against Portsmouth and Bristol, but the scale of attack was not heavy.
62. During these operations two enemy, aircraft were destroyed by; A.A.fire while our night fighters probably accounted for two others and damaged a third. Three of our own aircraft were lost.Coastal.63. During the week 334 patrols involving 608 sorties, including 259 convoy escorts, were flown by aircraft of Coastal Command.64. Many successful photographic reconnaissances of ports and aerodromeshave been carried out, extending from the Jade Estuary to Bordeaux. attempts to photograph similar objectives in Norway have been hampered by adverse weather conditions. Attacks upon enemy shipping have continued, and manynear misses have been observed. During their patrols our aircraft have engagedenemy aircraft when sighted and inflicted damage upon them. Aircraft of bothCoastal and Bomber Commands have carried out minelaying operations on alimited scale in the Havre, Brest and Bordeaux areas.65. Thirty-six enemy aircraft were suspected of minelaying on one night,but such operations were much restricted during the remainder of the week.Attacks by enemy aircraft on our shipping consisted of two attacks in the thames Estuary and one in the Humber, but the damage done was insignificant.German coastal units operated over the North Sea and Western Approaches,and their long-range reconnaissance aircraft covered the usual Atlantic area.Egypt and Libya.66. Intensive operations have been carried out by our Air Force in theMiddle East. At dusk on the 7th December Wellingtons from Malta carriedout a heavy and most successful attack on the aerodrome at Castel Benito(Tripoli) which achieved complete surprise. Still heavier attacks by combinedforces of Blenheims and Wellingtons from Egypt were made on Benina andEl Adem aerodromes, where concentrations of enemy aircraft were known to exist. Considerable damage was caused to hangars, administrative buildings,bomb and. petrol dumps and aircraft on the ground. It is believed that at CastelBeninto alone thirty-five aircraft were destroyed or damaged. Repeated daylight attacks have also been made on other enemy aerodromes and landing grounds.67. In addition to attacks upon the enemy Air Force our bombers and fighters have afforded direct support to the military operations by attacks uponenemy positions, troop concentrations and lines of communications. Near Sof afiheavy damage was inflicted on troops and on a large concentration of 400 M.T.vehicles. Great confusion and disorganisation has been caused among enemycolumns by low-flying machine-gun attacks.68. Our fighters have proved immeasurably superior to the enemy and haveinflicted heavy losses with only slight casualties to themselves.Greece and Albania.69. Very bad weather hampered British operations during the past week.Nevertheless, four attacks were delivered on Valona Harbour, where shipping and the harbour installations, a munition dump and motor transport vehicles were damaged. During these attacks enemy fighter opposition was encounteredand two of our aircraft were shot down and three are reported missing. Offensiveactions in support of the Greek land forces was also carried out against enemy troops on the coastal road West of Santi Quaranta. Italian offensive operations were confined to sporadic attacks on villages over a wide area, usually by single aircraft.Sudan and Bast Africa.70. Royal Air Force activity has been on an increased scale. TheMassawa-Agordat Railway was successfully attacked at Duanle and troop con-concentrations and motor transport vehicles in the Kassala area were bombed and machine-gunned. The hangars on the aerodrome at Asmara were alsoprobably hit.
71. Aircraft of the South African Air Force carried out a series of offensivereconnaissances. Bombs were dropped on an enemy camp at Gerile and on buildings at El Wak and Birkao in Italian Somaliland. In Southern Abyssiniahits were scored on the fort at Moyale and on large buildings near Mega.Air Intelligence.China.72. Reports confirm that Japanese bombing of the Burma Road has failedto interrupt traffic to any appreciable degree owing to the rapidity with which theChinese have effected repairs.River bridges hit during Japanese air raids have been quickly mended, andin many places supplementary bridges have been built and spare materials forrepair assembled.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.73,   The extent of enemy air activity is summarised under Air Situation.The most noticeable features of the week were a more than usually intensiveattack on London on the night of the 8th/9th December, and an attack on aconsiderable scale against Birmingham on the night of the 11th/12th December.74. The attack on London on the 8th/9th followed a night of absolute quiet.A feature of the raid was the number of fires started, the total being more than,700, of which nine were major; contrary to their practice heretofore, enemy aircraft appeared to drop LBs. after, or simultaneously with, the H.E. Manyof the fires were in the Dock area; the North-Western area was scarcely affected.The number of public buildings affected was greater than in any other single raid.75. Attacks were also carried out in the Portsmouth-Gosport area on the night of the 5th/6th, in Bristol on the night of the 6th/7th, and on birmingham and the Cheltenham-Gloucester area on the night of the 11th/12th.Damage.Service Property.76. Naval property and the Dockyard at Portsmouth were damaged on the night 5th/6th (see Naval Situation). The Royal Naval College, Greenwichsuffered damage from blast and the R.A.M.C. Headquarters, Millbank, were damaged during the night 8th/9th.Public Utilities.77. In London gas supplies suffered considerably, ten large and seven smaller-mains being fractured; electricity was not severely affected, nor were waterservices. Sewerage services were damaged in East Ham and Erith. In Bristolthe Feeder Road Power Station and a Corporation Electricity sub-station were damaged and the supply of electricity, and also of gas, was seriously interrupted.Water-mains were little damaged. Telecommunications were badly affected bythe destruction of the Instrument Room at the G.P.O. In Birmingham, damage,is reported to twelve gas-mains, eleven water-mains, and one main sewer, and atCheltenham two gas-holders were completely destroyed.Industry.London.78. Seventeen key-point factories were hit but in only two cases was damageserious : the Cosmos Manufacturing Coy., Brimsdown, Middlesex (Radio valvesand small tools), where output will be completely held up for a considerable time;and the M.H.H. Engineering Coy., Kennington Road, S.E. 11 (Aircraft fittings),where the factory was demolished and output will be held up indefinitely.
Bristol. . , /79. Five key-point factories were involved but in no case was damage severe.&apos;Several factories and industries, however, reported delay in production due tofailure of electric and gas services. War production was not directly affectedto any great extent.Birmingham.80. Twelve important factories were affected during the raid on the night11th/12th; the extent of damage and the effect on production has not yet been assessed, but it is believed that it will not prove to be serious in the majority ofcases.  Forty other factories are reported to have suffered minor damage.. Cheltenham.81. The Sunningend Works of Gloucester Aircraft were hit but sufferedlittle damage.Railways, Roads and Docks.82. In London there were twenty-one hits on the railway systems, affectingsome of the main-line termini and causing some disorganisation. A train was hit in Barnesbury Station, Islington. Five docks were hit, but the damage hasnot proved serious.  Roads were only temporarily affected.83. At Bristol there were five incidents on the railways in the district onthe night of the 6th/7th, temporarily blocking all main lines. There were direct hits on two trains, causing many casualties. No important roads were seriously damaged. :        - . ,: 84, All G.W:R. and L.M.S. main lines from Birmingham to the South were temporarily affected by damage &quot;in the City and area, but have been rapidlyrestored. Fires occurred in the L.M.S. Goods Station at Curzon Street and atHockley station. At Cheltenham the main line to South Wales and the West ofEngland was damaged.Civil Defence Establishments.85. Damage to A.R.P. premises and equipment occurred in London and birmingham. Considerable quantities of stores and equipment were lost, whileone First-Aid Post and a Rest Centre were hit, involving some casualties.A parachute mine necessitated the evacuation of the Control Centre atSmethwick. - &apos; - fPublic Buildings.London.86.   The following buildings suffered damage&apos;:  The Cloisters and St. Stephen&apos;s Hall, Houses of Parliament.Royal Mint, .     &apos; ,Ministry of Pensions (John Islip St.).National Maritime Museum.B.B.C., Langham Place.Port of London Authority.Southwark Town Hall.Minor damage was done to Westminster Abbey, the Royal Courts of Justice andthe Public Record Office.Bristol.87. The damage in this category was mainly by fire and involved the CouncilHouse, Assize Court, Corn Exchange, Guildhall and St. Michael&apos;s Church.Hospitals, Schools, &amp;c.London.88. Incidents have been reported from eight hospitals, including St. Giles,Camberwell, where 21 casualties occurred, and Whipps Cross, Leyton, where2 blocks were damaged and a few casualties resulted.[22013] d
Civilian Casualties.89. For the week ending 0600,* the 12th December, the approximate figures are 422 killed and 833 seriously injured compared to the previous week&apos;s figuresof 775 killed and 1,657 seriously injured.  The analysis is as follows : SeriouslyKilled.       injured.London        ...      ...      ......... 256 620Provinces     ...      ...      .......... 166 213Portsmouth, 5th/6th December    ...... 30 60Bristol, 6th/7th December......      ... 76 76* Figures for Birmingham and Cheltenham/Gloucester on the night llth/12th Decemberare not yet available.Parachute Mines.90. Up to the 11th December fewer mines had been dropped, consideringthe state of the moon, than had been anticipated. During the week ending onthat date 10 are reported to have detonated on impact, and 5 have been renderedsafe. Of these 5, 2 were in the London area and the other three were at Dartfordand Rochester. The rendering safe of one of those in the London area was of extreme urgency and importance, as it fell on London Bridge Station,endangering the. viaduct which carries the lines to Charing Cross and CannonStreet, as well as the station itself. The task of rendering it safe was begun assoon as it was daylight, but Temporary Lieutenant John Millar, R.N.V.R., had avery difficult and dangerous task, as the bomb fuse was leaking and consequently the usual precautions could not be taken. Twice it was thought that the minewas going to explode, but eventually the fuse was extracted and the mine was rendered safe by 1250 hours.Later Information.During the night of the 11th/12th December the enemy dropped mines onBirmingham By noon the 12th December fifteen had been reported, very few ofwhich had detonated on impact. The R.M.S. parties left London for Birminghamat 0515/12. ;Unexploded Bombs.91. The total outstanding has been reduced during the week by more than500 from 2,772 to 2,240.  Only one bomb in Category A is outstanding.Civil Defence Operations and Morale.92. The fire services have again borne the brunt of the enemy attacks,particularly in London, where on the night 8th/9th December 1,724 fires were reported.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Berlin. Bombs have fallen in the district of Weissensee and in the Danzigerand Moritz Strassen, causing heavy damage to property. On the night of thelst-2nd November the tunnel and railway lines at the Stettiner Station were damaged. An observer personally saw two fires, one to a brewery storehousebehind the Max and Haupt Strassen which lasted five hours, and the other to awarehouse in the goods yard of the Lehrter Station, which lasted eight hours. Inthe month of September the Schneider factory was hit.Information has been received that the Klingenberg and West power stations in Berlin have been seriously damaged and although still working are doing so on a greatly reduced scale. Experts have been sent from the Brown Boveriworks at Mannheim to Warsaw in order to examine three of their turbinesinstalled there with the object of transferring them to Berlin, but this schemeis now reported to have been dropped.This information is most important and indicates : (1) that the Berlin power supply situation must now be very difficult.(2) that the Germans are evidently experiencing great difficulty in providingspare generating plant to replace plant which has been damaged or destroyed.The Klingenberg and West power stations together account for a capacityof about 600,000 Kw. out of a total in the Berlin area of about 850 to 600,000 Kw.Even in normal times the stations in the Berlin area are incapable of supplying the whole of the Berlin load and considerable supplies are drawn through thegrid from other large stations mainly to the South of Berlin.Munich. Reports so far received give the following information :  &quot;Bombs fell in the Perusa and Residenz Strassen, near the national theatre, on Handelsbank, on the goods yard near the Ost Station, at Planegg(causing damage to house property) and on Karlsfeld (causing serious damage to a cable factory). The railway between Pasing and Aubing was hit and took twenty-four hours to repair, and the Alt Rathaus, near the Marienplatz,has been damaged.&quot;Gelsenkirschen. Damage to one of the oil refineries (which not stated) isvery considerable and regarded as serious.Hamm. A factory manufacturing electrodes has been so damaged that production has ceased.Duisberg-Ruhrort. The heavy attack on this inland port is stated to havebeen very efficient and to have led to considerable delay in the loading and move-ment of barges.Stettin. Reports have been received of hits on the oil refinery at Politz andof damage to the pipe-line leading from the refinery to the harbour. Petrol tanks,a 3,000 h.p. dynamo and a gasometer were destroyed.Hamburg. An observer saw buildings destroyed in the Werft Strasse andcertain burnt out oil tanks at Steinwarder. He heard that the lift of the Elbetunnel on the west bank was out of action for a fortnight in the first half ofOctober, due to bombs in the neighbourhood of Ferry No. 6. The Lombard bridge,which crosses the Alster Lake, is said to have been hit in the middle of october and was closed to traffic for twenty-four hours.
France.Havre. As a result of the raid on the night of the 18th September, a largenumber of ships and barges were set on fire in the harbour. The source states thatthis raid has caused the greatest damage suffered by the Germans in France up tothat date.Mining. The Norwegian Leda has been mined and sank off the SouthSwedish Coast, and the Norwegian Jadarland has been sunk off Haugesund. Atthe end of July a German torpedo boat returning from Copenhagen withGeneral Kaupitsch (the Commander of the troops who entered Denmark) onboard was mined and sank off Gjedser.  The General is said to have been drowned.On the early morning of the 27th November the German vessel Patagoniaof 6,000 tons sent out an S.O.S. from a position in Huibert Gat.Ships travelling between Gdynia and Nakskov travel in daylight only.Anchorages for the night are North of Kolberg, off Rugen and close to Femern.The presence of several sunken vessels about one mile from the Holtenau end ofthe Kiel Canal has again been reported.Italy.The Italian press has announced that a delayed action bomb dropped near the Fiat works at Mirafiori (Turin) exploded on the 30th November causing somecasualties including the Chief Technical Director of the works.
