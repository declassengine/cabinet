Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1940.MO^T^CRET.W.P. (4G) 480&apos;December 16, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER - LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PRE-ENTRY TRAINING FOR THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.The Need for an Air Training Corps.memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE requirements of the Royal Air Force in aircrew pilots and observersfor 1941 are of the order of 45,000. The requirements for 1942 will be evenheavier. These figures are exclusive of the numbers to be provided by Canada,Australia and New Zealand under the Empire Air Training Scheme. In addition,there are heavy requirements in air gunners and technical personnel.2. For aircrew duties we require men of the highest quality. They mustpossess a high standard of physical fitness and morale, and a considerable proportion should be potential leaders.3. If we are to secure men of the quality and in the quantity required, wemust do two things. Firstly5, we must secure for the Royal Air Force a larger proportion of the output of the universities and of the public and secondary schools than at present. Secondly, we must extend and improve the arrangementsfor pre-entry training; and we must make it possible not only for the public orsecondary school boy but for the boy who has left school also, to educate and prepare himself for Air Force service.4. At present the arrangements for pre-entry training are neither as complete nor as efficient as they should be.5. At the universities, air squadrons have recently been reformed at oxford and Cambridge, and squadrons will be formed at other universities as rapidly aspossible. I hope to see five squadrons form during the next University term and a further seven in the Summer Term. During their first year, members will carry out the equivalent of the training given at Initial Training Wings.During the second year I hope it will be possible to give some flying training.6. At the public schools some 40 O.T.C. (now Training Corps) contingentshave air sections. Boys are not, however, allowed to join the air sections until they have taken Certificate A, and the numbers permitted to join are limited.7. At some secondary schools there are units of the Air Defence CadetCorps. This organisation comprises some 200 units in all averaging some 100members each. Only a small number of these units are at schools, the remainderbeing based on localities.8.   If we are to organise pre-entry training for the Royal Air Force on anadequate scale, we must form an Air Training Corps which is equal in status tothe Army Training Corps.  I do not think that this organisation can, or should,be confined to the public or secondary schools, for our recruitment of aircrews[22026]
cannot be confined to these schools only. It will.be necessary to provide mean-by which the boy who leaves school at 15 or 16 is enabled to carry out trainingin his spare time and to bring his education up to the standard required.,9. We need a nation-wide organisation into which the air sections of theTraining Corps, the units and a large part of the organisation of the Air DefenceCadet Corps, and perhaps ultimately the university air squadrons will be mergedBut this organisation must be on at least ten times tt/e scale of our present-activities. /10. This Air Training Corps must be organised partly in school units andpartly in local units. I hope that it will be possible t&amp; establish school units at every public school and at the larger secondary schools, and I hope that local units will be established in every large town and, wherever possible, in country districtsas well.11. The University Air Squadrons are at present open to prospectivecandidates for the Fleet Air Arm on a basis of equality with candidates for theRoyal Air Force.  The same rule should apply to Air Training Corps units.12. I have taken preliminary soundings with the Chairman of theHeadmasters&apos; Conference for the Public Schools and with the President of theIncorporated Association of Headmasters for the Secondary Schools; and Ibelieve that I can count on their full co-operation. I am in touch with the Boardof Education, and they are helping me in sounding local interests.13. I propose to appoint at the Air Ministry a Director of Pre-EntryTraining, who will be a man well-known throughout the educational world whopossesses the confidence of the universities and schools. Outside the Air ministry the administration of the Air Training Corps will be vested in a Commandantwith a small staff, who would stand in much the same relation to the Air Ministryas a Group Commander. The method of financing the Air Training Corps will,of course, have to be discussed with the Treasury, but I contemplate that itwould be by a system of grants on a similar scale to the grants in issue to theTraining Corps. The grants will, however, be limited to boys of 16 and over.Some issues of equipment will also be made.&apos; 14. I do not anticipate any difficulty in providing instruction which is interesting to boys and valuable as a preparation for Air Force service. Thisinstruction would be similar to that given at the Initial Training Wings, and,so far as the schools are concerned, much of it could be given by mathematicsmasters. Nor do I anticipate difficulty in finding and training suitable officers forschools units.15. The provision of officers for local units may, however, present a majordifficulty. It will be essential to attract a better type of officer than the air defence Cadet Corps has succeeded in attracting up to date. We must make use as officers and instructors for part time employment of men with knowledgeof the Air Force or of the other Services who are over age or unfit for militaryservice, and also of professional and other men who are in reserved occupations.Many men who would make suitable officers and instructors are at present serving in the Home Guard, and it may be found essential to the success of the scheme that a number should be released for service with the Air Training Corps.16, The matter is of some urgency, as I am anxious to have cabinet approval in principle before a meeting of the Headmasters&apos; Conference which hasbeen fixed for the 20th December, at which the Chairman has promised to soundhis colleagues. Moreover, the Air Defence Cadet Corps movement is notoriouslyinadequate, and I have already stated in the House that I am reviewing thestatus of the Corps and the scale of grants.17. Consultation will, of course, be necessary with the Treasury, the WarOffice and the Board of Education on a number of points. At the present stageI merely ask the approval of the Cabinet in principle to the creation of an air training Corps on as wide a basis as possible for the provision of pre-entrytraining for youths who intend to join the Royal Air Force as aircrews ortechnicians.A H.
