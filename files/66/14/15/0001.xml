TTTTfi TiOGUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GCVERITMr. W f! v E T. Q-ii--J-^-&quot;;--- COPY NO. fgj*th De gemb-er 1940..iWAR    cabinet united STATES ACTIVITIES IN THE west indies AND OTHER BRITISH DEPENDENCIES.Memorandum by the Secretary oj^o^ate for the  Colonies,I circulate for the consideration of my colleaguesa Memorandum on recent United States activities in the west indies and other British dependencies,        In view of thegreat importance of our relations with the United States,I have up to -now felt it my duty to go as far as possibletc meet American requests , but I a..:n gravely disturbed at the apparent implications of some of these demands;, and I feelthat my colleagues should be aware of the dilemma which  .seems about to face us, either of being false on the oneband to the reiterated pledges given both mo the West IndianGcdonies as well as to the public in this country relative to the maintenance of full British sovereignty in the islands,  or on the other hand of imperilling our good relations with the United States.L-.Colonial Office,27th December,1940.M E M 0 R A N D U M.After the exchange of Notes regarding United states destroyers and Naval and Air facilities for the United states in Newfoundland,Bermuda, and the British West Indies, a combined Naval and Military Mission from the United states under- Admiral Greens lade, visited all the territories inwhich bases had been promised,i2,      Antigua, Bahamas, British Guiana and Jamaica. here the wishes of the United States Government have been fullymet..Bermuda.

-Bermuda^     The United States Government have agreed to anaTEernative proposal put forward &quot;by the Government ofBermuda.     This is satisfactory as the original proposalsv/ould have interfered seriously with the life of the Colony.There remains, however,  en important point to he settledregarding the emergency use of islands in the Great Sound,St, Lu.eia._a     A site in the north of the island has beenagreed to&quot;   a second site in the  south presents moredifficulty arid the question is being further explored.Trindd.ad._i       Agreement has nob yet been reached regardingsites, &quot;but everything possible is being done to meet thedemands of the United States Government.       These have,however,  to be reconciled with the future welfare of theinhabitants.3.      The final demands of the United States inrespect of the bases in Bermuda,  St. Lucia and Trinidadgo far beyond those originally mentioned.      For example,in St. Lucia,   (where we keep no garrison at all)  agarrison of 1,000 American troops is now envisaged instead of250 as originally proposed.      In Trinidad the originaldemand was for a &quot;Naval and Air Ease&quot;:  an additional demand was then made for an expeditionary force of two divisions(at least 20,000 men)  to be stationed there.      This has beenscaled down, but there is still a demand for accommodation for a force of no less than- 9,000 men in all.4.      It is not surprising therefore that already thereis a marked fear on the part of the West Indians thatthe establishment of the bases will affect british sovereignty in these ancient Colonies and derogate from theircherished British nationality.        The attitude of the whiteinhabitants of these Colonies is clear from the attachedaddresses of the Bermuda house of-Assembly (Annex i),whilefears have been expressed in the Windward Islands.-wherethe population is mostly coloured,  that the visits ofrecent United States Missions were the thin end of thewedge towards American penetration.5.      The plain fact is that the West Indians, inspite of their present poverty and their -clear realisation of thefinancial benefits which will certainly accrue frojn the.establishment of United States bases,  are yet mostapprehensive of the arrival of United States forces.      Thisis due partly to a deep-seated loyalty and attachment toBritish traditions,  .^al not less to the fear that Americantreatment of the Negro and coloured population will follow the lines notorious In the Southern United States *6,      I had been authorised at the outset to say thatthese leases would in no way affect British sovereignty anda certain measure of relief was temporarily drawn from mypublic pronouncement to that effect:    it had been hoped inconsequence that there would be no interference by the UnitedStates in the administration and internal economy of theColonies outside the areas set apart for the American bases,and^the preliminary consideration here of the  judicial andadministrative problems arising from the agreement has been proceeding on this assumption.

7.      It is therefore disturbing to find that a UnitedStates &quot;Economic Mission&quot; which, at very short notice, had visited some of the British West Indian Colonies, has giventhe impression that it is studying the possibility ofestablishing an International Body designed to co-ordinateeconomic and social efforts within the Caribbean area,including the control of production and prices in relationto the markets within the Western hemisphere.     Moreover,President Roosevelt&apos;s attitude has convinced the Governor ofthe Windward Islands, who met the President at St. Lucia,that the ideal at which he is aiming is nothing less thanmutual control by the United States and.British governments ofall activities in St. Lucia, without the abrogation ofsovereign British rights.      It is however impossible to see how British sovereign rights can in practice survive under such an arrangement.     Again? the Governor of Trinidad has reported that he understood that one of the United Statesrequirements in that island would be the right to instal thenecessary defence devices at the northern and southernentrances of the Gulf of Paria &quot;at such time as the    -responsibility for the defence of the island of Trinidadmay pass from His Majesty&apos;s Government to that of the UnitedStates of America&quot;, and the attitude of Admiral Greensladein his discussions with the Governor supports this view.8.     While nothing has yet been said or done to indicateprecisely the United States views regarding judicial andadministrative questions in the Colonies where bases are tobe established,,  it is clear that they differ fundamentallyfrom our views and those of the Colonies concerned, whilethe visit of President Roosevelt and the &quot;Economic Mission&quot;referred to above (whicn included Naval and Military Officers)are straws indicating in which way the wind is blowing.9.      The extremely brusque methods adopted by the UnitedStates authorities in various matters x^elating to british colonies clearly indicate that they have little respect forBritish sovereignty in these places.     The following are afew . examplesj(a) The offer by the United States Government withoutany reference to us, of the use of the West Indianbases to other American Republics.(b) The claim to 33 British-owned islands in the Pacific(eleven of which are settled and administered) andthe refusal of the United States Government to respond to our invitation to state the grounds onwhich the claim to the eleven settled islands isbased or even&apos; to state whether the list of the 23islands is their complete claim.(c) The demand on the 14th November for permission to survey on the 15th November, Makin Island,  in the pacific, from the air without any indication of thereason for such a request and without allowing timefor an enquirys(d)

(d) The visit of United States ships and aircraft toBritish Colonies,  especially in war-ti$e,without the normal prior permission being obtained, e,g. the visit of the Survey Ship&quot;Ocearicgrapher&quot;  to - Trinidad.(e) The visit to certain West  Indian Colonies of theIfieonomie Mission&apos;&apos; referred to above, without giving - adequate notice.      In this ease the Mission- actually started before permission was obtained andalthough tihe United States Government was told that the visit was inconvenient o.x the presenttime,it was nevertheless  insisted on.The S3 high-handed acts have evoked protests fromthe Colonial Office,  and the attached telegram (Annex Ii),with the approval of the Prime Minister,  was sent to HisMajesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Washington on the  subject.While some of the instances there cited, e,g. the offer ofthe use of the West Indian bases to other American Republicsand the visit without previous permission of the United -States Survey ship to Trinidad, effect the West Indian area,,ether instances such as the claim to 23 British-owned islands in the Pacific seem to suggest a similar attitude towardsother British Colonial dependencies.,10,      Prom the very outset and throughout the preliminarynegotiations in respect of the West Indian bases the BritishGovernment has insisted that the final arrangements should besettled by a conference in London.      We are now informed byHis Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Washington that the UnitedStates authorities feel unable to send a deputation toLondon,  the reason being that the Departments concerned,  andin particular/the State Department could not spare thenecessary personnel for such a long period.      He adds thatall the United States Cabinet Ministers concerned havedefinitely decided that it is not possible to send officials to London,  and that President Roosevelt  is anxious that thediscussions should tale place in Washington,      No regardapprears to have been given to the fact that it is at least as difficult for the British, who are now fighting for their lives,  to send representatives to the United States,  andthat these representatives must include  senior Naval andAir Force Officers whose services can ill be spared.      This,however,  is in keeping with the attitude adopted generallyby United States representatives in discussions with thecolonial governments over the sites for bases in the west indies:    in some &apos;cases local objections to the United Statesdemands were brushed aside as unworthy even of consideration.11^      The Agreement for, the American bases is to run for99 years,  and it is felt that there is not only a definiterisk to our effective sovereignty over the  islands but alsoa real danger of friction between the United States and theBritish Governments if the present American attitude to our views and to the susceptibilities of the West  Indian people is^not modifisdo     Further, while this memorandum refersprincipally to the West Indies,  it would appear from paragraph

9 above that the danger is not confined to this area.12,     My attention has also been drawn by the Ministryof Information to the me menturn now gained in the UnitedStates by a movement for the sale of some part of the british west Indies to the United States,  either in liquidation of past war debts or in payment, for present purchases.      this movement, originating no doubt with a few irresponsiblepeople.,  is now supported,.   I understand,  by a number ofimportant figures and I feel strongly that it may take a dangerous hold on the public mind in America unless it isstopped by some emphatic statement on the British side.The movement is not a new one 3      As long ago as1919 it was necessary for one&apos; of.my predecessors  (lord milner)  to state, in response to protests from certaincolonies,  that &quot;Ills Majesty&apos;s Government have no intentionof ceding....... any West Indian Colony to any foreign power&quot;,      Again,  on the 8th of March,  1920,  in answer toa question in the House of Commons, the then Prime Minister(Mr. Lloyd George)  stated that  &quot;There  is not the slightestintention on the part of his Majesty5s Government to barteror sell any portion of the British West Indies, whoseinhabitants are loyally attached to the Crown and intenselyproud of their membership of the British Empire&quot;,      On thesame day another of my predecessors (Colonel Amery)  stated   &apos;that &quot;the British Empire  is not for sale&quot;c      A similar statement was ma.de,  about the same time, by the thenPrince of Wales.      On the 6th March, 1934,  in reply to aquestion whether he would give an assurance that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not agree to a settlement of war debts byceding territory or any portion of the British Empire,  thePrime Minister (Mr, Ramsay MacDonald)  said that it is self-evident that there could under no circumstances &quot;Jye anyquestion of such an arrangement. &apos;   Finally,  on the 4-thDecember,  1940,  the Lord Privy Seal (Mr. Attlee)  replied inthe affirmative to an enquiry whether he would give an assurance that the Government will not barter the sovereignty of any British territory in return for war supplies from foreign countries,In my opinion it is essential that a statement tothe same effect should be made,  at a very early date, bythe Prime Minister or by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairso

Reginald Conyejrs.Speaker, House of Assembly,Bermuda.19th August,1940.

4.      House of Assembly further trust that His Excellencywill be pleased to advise the House that he would welcome the appointment of joint committee of the Honourable LegislativeCouncil and the House of Assembly to advise His Excellency inrespect to financial,  social and economic problems which will arise as a result of establishment of American base,.   5.    The House also requests that Your J-ellency will^ePleased to inform the President ox  ,n^Un ^d   ta^ ^ ^Colony id proud of being associateJ- w**-- ^   ^en democracy, and united States of America in   oinj cu,i      e base insincerely trust that establishment oi an a., anathese islands will strengthen the txeso. friendship^^ ^existing between the people oi tne unn-cuthe British Empire.Session of the House,  27th November, 1940.&apos; &quot;    -       Cb) - - - v,:::;MESSAGE FROM    THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY,BERMUDA.May it please Your Excellency;    the House of Assembly has the honour   to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency&apos;s messageNo. 183 in which Your Excellency announces that agreement on broadlines has been reached between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theUnited States of America of a Naval and Air base in these Islands.2r      We must confess that the area involved and the schemegenerally far exceeds anything we had expected or diedinferred from Your Excellency&apos;s message No.  1500        We feel thatthese Islands are indeed small for such a project.      We neverthelessrecognise that the safety of the Empire must he overriding-consideration in this matter? and we therefore respectfully informYour Excellency that we concur on&apos; broad lines in the site shown onthe map which accompanied Your Excellency&quot;s message.     We express the hope? however? that wherever possible modifications will bemade so as to alleviate the hardships which will he caused byexpropriation on St, David&apos;&apos;s Island,      We note that the question of grant of minor facilities affecting an Island or Islands in the -Great Sound is under consideration.       Feeling that any additionto extensive facilities already agreed to would be deplorable?we earnestly hope that it will not be necessary to grant any facilities whatever in the Great Sound,3d      We have examined the report of the Bermuda Committeewhich was attached to Your Excellencyf,s message? and. we are inagreement with the views expressed therein^       We agreeespecially with the view that adoption of a scheme of the magnitude proposed will give rise to grave economic? social andpolitical dislocation in the life of these Islands, and wetherefore consider that compensation should not be limitedto the owners of private property which may be acquirked or maysuffer direct damage by reason of establishment of the base,We think it equitable that in addition- to such compensation thereshould be adequate compensatory measure (for which the Governmentof the United States should be responsible) with a view toadjusting as far as possible loss and injury which will besuffered by the community as a whole.        We also expect thattitle to the property expropriated will be vested in BermudaGovernment subject to proposed lease to the Government of theUnited States.

ANNEX IICypher telegram to Mr. Butler, Washington.Sent 1 p.m.  20th November,  1940.No.   3127. IMMEDIATE.My telegram No.  3098 /&quot;of 18th November:    proposed visit of.United States Economic Mission to certain West Indianislands^.The Colonial Office feel very strongly that unreasonableattitude of United States in this matter is only one example of a series of similar cases in which insufficient regard has&quot;been had for British interests and susceptibilities.        Forinstance, inadequate notice and justification have been given of proposed visits by American persons, aircraft, and naval vessels to Colonial dependencies and immediate replies pressed for in spute of the fact that ^in every case reference has to&quot;be made both to home authorities and to the local governmentsconcerned, and in spite of great pressure of work both inLondon and the colonies owing to the war.2.    The following sire examples of what we have in mind:(a) The offer of the United States Government, without any reference to us, of the use of the West Indian bases toother American Republics.(b) The suddenly increased demands in Trinidad where sites for Air and Naval bases had been agreed to but where accomoda-tion is now asked for an expeditionary striking force ofno less than one or two divisions^.(c) Claim to 23 British-owned islands in the Pacific (elevenof which&apos; are settled and administered)  and subsequent refusal of United States Government to respond to our invitation tostate grounds on which claim to eleven settled islands is basedor even to state whether list of 23 islands is their completeclaim.(d) Visit of United States survey ship &quot;Oceanographer&quot;  toTrinidad without permission being sought.(e) Demand on 14th November conveyed to us by United states embassy on 15th November for permission to survey from theair Makin Island in Pacific without any indication of reasonfor such request and without allowing time for enquiry.3.      This sort of thing may lead to the very state ofaffairs we should try to avoid, namely friction between british Colonial governments and peoples and the United States,as well as causing Colonial Office and Governors veryconsiderable embarrassment.      I leave it to your discretion todetermine the method by which United States Government canwithout offence most conveniently be made aware of our feelingsand so brought to avoid action that creates unnecessarydifficulties.
