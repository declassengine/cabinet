MOST SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.Dominions Office,Downing Street, S.W. 1,Prime Minister, November1 22, 1940.I THINK you may like to see the enclosed memorandum of personalitiesand problems in Eire which has been sent to us by Maffey. This is written bya man whom Maffey describes as a hundred per cent. Irishman who was a rebeland certainly believes what he says. Maffey says that the views recorded reflecta certain prejudice, but at the same time reflect a point of view which cannotbe altogether ignored, though for his part he does not think that it would be expedient from our point of view to accept its suggestions as to our line of action.CRANBORNE.The Right HonourableWinston S. Churchill, C.H., M.P.Memorandum.SINCE De Valera has been in power the British Government have consistently made the mistake of expecting from him a generous response to a generous gesture. Generosity is not in his nature. He is cold, calculating andegotistical. His first interest is himself that he should be the leader andmonopolise the limelight. To maintain this position he must have and hold the mass of the voters; that is, the lower classes. Owing to the extremely rigidcensorship he is at the moment in a position of dictatorial power. No person or party inside the country has any hope of successfully resisting him underthe present conditions.The difficulty of the situation is vastly increased by the fact that he is toall intents and purposes blind, and can read nothing. In the business ofGovernment only two persons have unlimited and authoritative access to him;in other words &quot; have his ear.&quot; The formation of his judgments and decisions,therefore, must be largely influenced by what these two men say or read to him or omit to say or read and the emphasis they choose to give to various wordsand sentences.These two men are Frank Aiken, Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence,and Joe Walsh, Secretary to the Department for External Affairs. Frank Aikenhas more influence with De Valera than any other member of his Cabinet orParty, fie is the most anti-British Minister, and the only one who is alsodefinitely pro-German. Even to-day he has a secret contact with the extremeI.R.A. and provides De Valera with a link with them which would be very valuable should a situation ever arise in which De Valera might wish to joinforces with them.Joe Walsh is self-made, with no really solid background.   He. is convincedthat Germany will win, and is most anxious that we shall continue to sit on thefence, while taking great care to do nothing to annoy Germany.    He has developed in recent months from a timid neutral to a positive pro-German.   His[21970]
Department is now almost a branch of the German Legation, and is uniqueamongst the Government Departments in that respect.No small Power with any self-respect can afford to give way before a threat of physical force, and this particularly applies to Ireland. But no country inthe world will react more readily to economic pressure. If at the time paymentof the annuities was refused, England had taken a firm line and banned allIrish cattle, De Valera would have been put out of power in a month and his political reputation ruined for good. Another and even better opportunity hasnow arisen over the ports, and the mistake of the past must not be repeated.The British Government should officially inform the Irish Government that,owing to the difficulties of protecting shipping, they require all the availablecargo space in the convoys for their own use and that of their allies, and thatin future no goods whatever which are destined for Ireland, either directly or indirectly, can be carried in convoys.Ships sailing out of convoy and direct to Ireland should be put through allthe delays and troubles of contraband control at a British Port well out of their normal route.Further to this, the British Government should adopt one of the threefollowing courses : 1. Refuse to receive from Ireland any further cattle, farm produce or manufactured goods, on the ground that they do not need them.2. Decide to pay a very reduced price for these goods, which would make ituneconomic for Ireland to export them.3. Prohibit the sailing of all ships other than the passenger Mail Boat toHotyhead, on the ground that they cannot spare warships to protect them.The effect of these measures will be to close rapidly the vast majority of irish Factories, thus throwing out of work thousands of labourers who have givenDe Valera credit, support and votes for getting them their employment. Theywill demand measures to restore their livelihood, and, if he fails, they will quicklyturn against him. The moneyed business community, which has supported him in the past and subscribed to his party funds, will also be alienated.Further than this, and much more important, every fair in the country willcompletely collapse. If this hajDpens to two consecutive fairs (covering, say, one month), all the peasant farmers, who are the backbone of De Valera&apos;s party, willbe calling for his blood, and he will be swept from power for good in a wave ofindignation.De Valera&apos;s only answer to economic pressure could be to refuse to sendcattle and food-stuffs to England. But this possibility will be removed by Englanddoing so first.Full and continued publicity should be given to all these measures so thatno one in Ireland can be in any doubt as to what is happening, and why. the broadcasts of the B.B.C. are a most effective counter to the present Irishcensorship.  In fact, they are the only thing which can surmount it.Prime Ministers Personal Minute.   Serial No. M. 339.(Most Secret.)Minister of Food.DO not circulate the attached* to your Department but let me know exactly the effect that would be produced on your problems by the cutting off of Irishsupplies of food for say six months.(Intld.) W. S. C.November 23, 1940.* Report forwarded by Lord Cranborne.
(Most Secret.)Ministry of Food,November 26, 1940.Dear Prime Minister,I HAVE your minute No. 339 on Ireland.If we were to take the action you indicate we could increase our home production of bacon and eggc and help to free the port of Liverpool. We could do these things because we should no longer arrange for shipping 300,000 to400,000 a year of feeding-stuffs and a quantity of fertilisers to Eire, in returnfor which we now get 150,000 tons of food from that country.In carrying out this new policy we must fulfil our existing contractual obligations, and feeding-stuffs which have actually been purchased on behalf ofthe Eire Government and are afloat must be delivered.The chief difficulty that I foresee is in respect of fat and store cattle. we need Eire fat cattle to maintain the present ration, although they provide lessthan 5 per cent, of our meat. Eire store cattle come to this country for fatteningand are a part of our general agriculture : but, as Hudson said the other day(W.P. (G.) (40) 304, p. 2), &quot; in view of the anticipated shortage of feeding-stuffshere, our previous need for Irish store cattle has been considerably reduced.&quot;You should know that we are at present subsidising Irish produce asfollows &apos;.&apos; &apos;I should be prepared to take the risk of refusing to buy anything from southern Ireland if it were accompanied (a) by the re-direction to this country of feeding-stuffs now imported intoEire in British-controlled vessels; and(b) by a complete prohibition of the export from this country to Eire of allfood and feeding-stuffs either for human or for animal consumption.I believe that such a step would so profoundly disturb Irish agricultureduring the next three months as to render negotiations possible with themsubsequently on our terms.BaconBeef from Eire fat cattle .Beef from Eire store cattle 870,000420.0002,180,000 3,470,000Sincerely yours,WOOLTON.The Rt.

Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1940.MOST SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs:IN his letter of the 25th November Sir John Maffey assesses the presentposition in Eire as he sees it, and asks His Majesty&apos;s Government for guidance asto the policy which they propose to pursue. It is clearly his view that nothing is to be hoped from any approach to Mr. de Valera, and there is ample confirma-tion of this from other sources. There is, indeed, at present no reason why heshould budge from his present position. He is by nature intensely rigid andobstinate. He has shown himself in the past temperamentally incapable ofconcession or compromise, and there is no indication that he has changed. Heis, moreover, a singularly astute politician, and the present position suits himadmirably. There can be no doubt that the policy of neutrality has almostunanimous support in Eire to-day. It suits the Irish patriots, who don&apos;t likeEngland. It suits the ordinary easy-going people, who don&apos;t want war, with allthe horrors and dangers that come in its train- Especially are they terrified of bombing. Not only self-indulgence^ but fear plays a great part in determiningtheir present &quot;attitude. Eire to-day, by all accounts, is a sort of Gideon&apos;s Fleecein a devastated continent, immune from the misfortunes that afflict the otherpeoples of Europe. In Eire alone the ordinary life of peace time is still carriedon. There are no bombs, no blackout, no conscription, no disturbance of normalexistence. People still hunt and shoot and race, dine out and go to theatres andcinemas in the evenings. Rationing has indeed been instituted, but it is of avery mild kind, and all reports that reach this country speak of abundant food,lashings of cream, and practically unlimited petrol. Is it surprising that theIrish people should want so desirable a state of things to go on? Dimly they realise that they owe it to the British Fleet. But they give us no thanks for that.They think that we do it purely out of self-interest, because Eire is indispensable to us. A prominent American journalist who went over there last week confirmsthis in an article published in the Daily Telegraph on the 26th November.:  &quot; I asked who brought their overseas food to them, and they said &apos; TheBritish.&apos; They said they got all their tea and sugar and petrol in Britishconvoys, but they added that the British were not doing all that merely because of the beautiful blue-eyes of the Irish. It was just business, theyasserted, and if the British said they would be obliged to cut off Eire&apos;s petrolsupply, then the Irish would be obliged to reply, &apos; We will not sell you ourcattle.&apos; &quot;That is the situation as the Irish see it. There is, to their mind, no reason why it should not go on for ever. They have made up their minds that we cannot afford to quarrel with them. If we do, they will fight us, and we shall not be ableto face that, for economic as much as for military reasons. And so, when we askfor naval facilities in the Irish ports and for air bases on the Irish coasts, they and Mr. de Valera himself, though perhaps for different reasons, combine to give us a flat refusal.[21982]
The question is how to resolve this deadlock, should the imperative needsof our war situation demand it. It can clearly not be done by ordinary methodsof common sense. They are impervious to that. They must know that there isno sympathy for their attitude in any part of the world except possibly in thedictator countries, which they hate. The Press of the Dominions and the UnitedStates has been almost uniformly hostile. But they do not bother about this.How, then, is this problem to be approached ?It seems to me that there are two alternatives open to us. The first and mostobvious is to march in, horse, foot and artillery, and take the ports. We haveforces in Northern Ireland. We can strengthen them and invade Eire. That, ifthe worst comes to the worst, is what we shall be obliged to do. But it has evidentdisadvantages. It will be very expensive; it will not be very edifying; it willarouse a considerable opposition among Irish elements in the United States andeven in the Dominions; above all, it will rally the whole Irish nation behindMr. de Valera, which is the last thing we want to do. I cannot help feeling thatit should not be tried till everything else has failed.There is, however, a second possible course of action, which might, I suggest,render the other unnecessary, and should in any case be tried first. The irish people are at present living in a world of illusion. They consider that aprosperous Eire is indispensable to Britain. They think that their products are essential to our existence, and that we are bound, in our own interest to protect their trade, to keep them fat. whether they remain neutral or not. But this assumption is, I believe, entirely false. It is true that there are certain advantages to us in having a nearby larder. But the Ministry of Food and the Board ofAgriculture, in the recent discussions on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, made it abundantly clear that they did not regard this as an overriding consideration.The exports of Eire represent so small a proportion of our total consumption that,in their view, it need hardly be taken into account. If this be true, then so farfrom the United Kingdom being dependent on Eire, the opposite is the fact. Sheis entirely dependent on us. We should take every means of opening the eyes ofthe Irish people to this fact. Quietly, unostentatiously, without any public declaration of policy, we should employ every method in our power to keep herlean. We should refrain, so far as is possible, from purchasing in her markets,explaining, if we are challenged, that we feel an obligation to buy first fromthose countries that are allied., with us in the war rather than from neutrals. Weshould make it as difficult as possible,for her to charter ships, indicating that we require them for our own needs. We might eyen?r in the last resort, refuse to admit ships trading with Eire in our.convoys. This wodld^df^Bdufste^b^ a muchmore far-reaching measure than the others. It would not merely be treating herlike other neutrals. It would be penalising her in comparison with other neutrals.It might even be regarded as definitely hostile, though it might be defended onthe lines : &quot; You won&apos;t give us the advantages of your ports. We won&apos;t give you the advantages of our Fleet.&quot; But, at any rate, whatever the pros and consof going so far as that, we should, I suggest, consider all other means calculated to bring her to her senses. What would be the result of such a policy ? No doubt,it would cause considerable irritation against us. But it would also inevitablysow doubts in the minds of wide sections of opinion in Eire as to the wisdom ofthe policy of Mr. de Valera. The farmers, the manufacturers, all would findincreasing difficulty in selling their goods. They would begin to ask that theIrish Government should take some action. And what action could they take?They would no doubt make representations to the British Government. But weshould reply that they would appreciate that our first obligation must be to our allies, while, so far as the ships were concerned, the increasing toll on shippingby reason of enemy action must inevitably involve some shortage of ships, and itwas natural that we should give a priority to our own requirements. Nor shouldsuch a policy arouse opposition against us in the United States and othercountries, where the probable reaction would be that the Irish had made theirown bed and must expect to lie in it.I do not for a moment suggest that the course of action which I have outlined above would be likely to induce a spirit of compromise in Mr. de Valera himself.Nothing, I believe, would do that. But it should tend to weaken his hold on theIrish people, instead of strengthening it, as would be the case if we marched in.It may be argued that to make effective such a policy would take too long.   This
is of course, a matter for experts, for the Ministries of Shipping, Supply, food and Agriculture, and the Board of Trade. But I gather that the crisis is not likely to be quite immediate. The crux is not expected to come before the Spring.If we started at once, we should have four months, and by that time some progressshould have been made in pricking the bubble of Irish complacency.It may, of course, be that this policy that I have adumbrated, of silentsanctions, is for technical reasons impossible to apply. The practical difficultiesmay be too great. It may hit not only Eire but ourselves too hard. But even so,we must in any case, I am sure, find some means of drumming into the Irishconsciousness that the question of the provision of facilities for naval and air bases in the South and West of Ireland is not, properly viewed, an issue betweenEire and the United Kingdom. It is a problem in the solution of which the twocountries are equally interested. There is in fact only one pool of ships fromwhich they can satisfy their joint requirements. If it is diminished by enemy action, both will no doubt suffer : but Eire will suffer first. If the Irish peoplecan once be made to recognise this fact, we shall have laid the foundation of asettlement. Then it will be for us to make such a settlement possible. There ismuch that we could offer. First and foremost, there is the provision of some measure of protection for Irish ports and cities against the danger of Germanbombing. This seems indeed likely to be the sine qua non of any agreed settle-ment. No Irish Government that did not insist on it could live. The Irish people are genuinely terrified, and their fears would have to be allayed. Secondly, thereis the restoration of those full facilities for trade and commerce which in themeantime, under the policy which I have suggested above, would have been with-drawn from them. These would represent solid contributions from our side.Moreover, in the more conciliatory atmosphere created by these negotiations, we might even take the opportunity of tackling the thorny question of partition,with a view to finding a solution satisfactory to Northern and Southern Ireland.Such is the policy which I have in mind. I would not for one moment over-estimate the prospects of its success. But at any rate this can be said of it.It does not prejudice alternative approaches to the problem. It can runconcurrently with the application of further pressure by the United States.Were the President, for instance, to repeal the Cash and Carry Act and to askfor facilities in Southern Ireland for American warships and planes protectingconvoys across the Atlantic, the Eire Government would surely be the more likelyto accede to his request, if their own economic position was unhappy. They might go that far, and it would be far enough for us. Nor, if the worst came to the worst, would it prevent us, in the ultimate event, marching in. That course would still be open to us. But it does hold out some hope of averting what I think weall feel would be a deplorable thing, and for that reason I suggest that it is worthtrying.(Signed) CRANBORNE.Dominions Office,December 3, 1940.

The price paid to Irish producers is the same, or a little lessthan that paid in the United Kingdom, and the Ministry of Food incur a loss.The subsidy to beef from Eire store cattle represents, I understand, anestimate made by the Ministry of Food of the proportion of. the subsidy to home produced fat cattle, which is passed on by the producers in the prices they pay for imported store cattle from Eire.There is an Agreement made in November 1939 for a specified quantity ofbacon on a continuing basis subject to two weeks&apos; notice on either side. Thereis no contract for beef from Eire fat cattle, and this subsidy would automaticallycease with the cessation of imports. Store cattle from Eire are imported on private account, not by the Ministry of Food, and to stop the element of subsidy in the price (if the imports continue at all) it would be necessary for the Ministryof Food to take over the purchases.The Irish could not, I am advised, take effective retaliatory measures against us so far as this matter is concerned. The various payments which they used tomake to us before 1932 were cancelled in the Agreement with de Valera&apos; of 1938.The Irish hold a great deal of sterling and we should, have to block their sterling balances and treat them much in the same way as we treat the Roumanians.(Initialled) K.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1940.MOST SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER. LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.EIRE.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.OUR exports to Eire in 1940 have been at the rate of  24 million a year.The principal items are coal and many kinds of manufactured goods. We alsore-export goods to a value of nearly  6 million a year.There is nothing in the terms of the Trade Agreement of 1938 to prevent us from cutting off our exports to Eire; but such action would, of course, be entirelycontrary to the principles of the Agreement and would kill it in fact if notin form.These exports earn no useful currency, and Eire&apos;s ability to replace them by imports costing dollars is limited by her inability to command the necessary shipping.The denial of these exports will doubtless cause some local unemployment inthis country; in particular, the effect on the coal-mining industry will be serious.Generally, however, it will be the usual problem of absorbing free labour into war industry and should not constitute more than a temporary objection.As regards the future, the geographical position of Eire, and her dependence on our market for her produce, should ensure that our export trade will be restored when we wish. She may attempt to replace supplies from us by furtherdeveloping her own manufacturing industries; but she will be short of the coal and raw materials necessary to do so.On trade grounds, therefore, I see little objection to the proposed economic pressure as a short-term measure. At long-term the effects would be bad. I wouldlike to add that exports should be gradually curtailed rather than suddenly cutoff in order to allow time for the labour and plant to be absorbed as smoothly aspossible into war production.Whatever the results of this policy may be, they will probably be unexpected.I fear that it will make us rather than Mr. de Valera unpopular with the irish people; but so will any alternative course of action open U* us.(Initialled) 0.

It is difficult to see how Eire could stop this trade, because (1) the farming community could not face the loss; and (2) these animals are surplus toher own requirements, for meat and stores must be sent over through lack of feedto fatten them in Eire. This would be accentuated if supplies of imported feedingstuffs are cut short.Store Cattle.3. No serious effects here would, however, arise if the Eire store cattle werestopped, except local difficulties in particular areas, such as East Scotland and east anglia. Last June the United Kingdom cattle population was the highest formany years and the ploughing up of grassland will anyhow reduce facilities forfattening cattle on grass next summer.Dairy Stock.4. Imports of dairy stock amount to only 1\ per cent, of total dairy herd inthe United Kingdom. The loss of these replenishments would not generally affectthe milk supply in the immediate future. By the time most of them would be inmilk the present shortage should be over. Furthermore, if present imports of feeding-stuffs into Eire (about 400,000 tons, mainly maize) were diverted to theUnited Kingdom, larger supplies would be available here for dairy and otherstock, thereby assisting to maintain our milk output.Other Livestock.5.
