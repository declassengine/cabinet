SECRET.W.P. (41) 26(Also Paper No. C.O.S. (41) 78)February 6, 1941TO BE KEPT UNDER LOOS AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 75)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon January 30th, to12 noon February 6th,1941[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]
NAVAL SITUATION.General &quot;Review.THE period has been one of comparative quiet at sea except in theMediterranean, where air operation was carried out by the Fleet Air Arm againstthe main power installation in Sardinia.Shipping losses reported have shown a marked increase and have been duealmost entirely to attacks by enemy aircraft and U-boats. . . vThe Suez Canal has been closed owing to minelaying by enemy aircraft.Home Waters.2. H.M. Armed Boarding Vessel Crispin, a special anti-aircraft ship,was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat 400 miles to the westward of the BloodyForeland on the 4th February. H.M. Ships in the vicinity took off the crewand casualties are unlikely to be heavy.H.M. Submarine Swordfish unsuccessfully attacked an enemy merchant ship off Kristiansund on the 30th January and another off the Lister Light on the2nd February..A blockship was successfully sunk in the western entrance to Dover Harbouron the 5th February. ,&apos;Two H.M. trawlers have been sunk, one by aircraft and one by mine, and five auxiliary craft have been damaged during the week. Details are given inAppendix V.Mediterranean.3. H.M. Ships Renown, Malaya, Ark Royal and light forces operated offSardinia on the 2nd February. Owing to unfavourable weather the original planshad to be modified, but at dawn 8 Swordfish made an attack on the Tirso Damwhich holds the water for the hydro-electric station. Observation of results wasimpossible; but it is thought that 3 torpedoes hit the dam. Heavy A.A. fire wasexperienced and one aircraft failed to return. During this operation theMediterranean Fleet demonstrated in the Eastern Mediterranean, but no enemy ships were encountered.4. H.M. Submarine Upholder off the Tunisian coast sank an 8,000-ton shipon the 28th January and another of 5,000 tons on the 30th January.On the 31st January two German aircraft bombed and damaged thes.s. Sollum in the neighbourhood of Sidi Barrani. The ship, which was carryingItalian prisoners, drifted ashore and casualties among the prisoners were heavy.H.M. Minesweeper Huntley was bombed and sunk near Marsa Matruh on thesame day by two Heinkel 111; one officer and 12 men were killed. The hospital ship Dorsetshire was bombed and damaged on the 1st February off the coast ofEgypt.During the period 5 French merchant ships have passed Gibraltar eastbound and 6 west bound, all under escort.Other Foreign Stations.5. On the 30th January H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Comorin inter-cepted the French s.s. Capitaine Paul La Merle (4,945 tons) on passage toCasablanca about 200 miles East of Martinique. Subsequently, the ship was allowed to proceed as she was within the American neutrality zone.On the 31st January H.M.S. Devonshire intercepted the French Desirade(9,645 tons) carrying 1,500 troops, about 650 miles south-west of Freetown, but was later instructed to release the ship.On the 1st February H.M. Ocean Boarding Vessel Marsdale intercepted theSpanish s.s. Castillo Almansa (1,407 tons) with a cargo of empty oil drums200 miles N.E. of Canaries, and sent her to Gibraltar with an armed guard onboard.On the 5th February the Dutch Sloop Van Kinsbergen intercepted the Danishtankers s.s. Christian Holm (9,119 tons) and s.s. Scandia (8,571 tons) and isescorting them to Trinidad.
Anti-Submarine Operations.6. The only attack during the period was carried out by ELM. DestroyerHarvester about 450 miles west of Blacksod Bay on a doubtful contact in thevicinity of a ship that had been torpedoed seven hours previously. There was no-visible result.Enemy Intelligence.German.7. Air reconnaissance of Kiel on the 30th January showed a Hipper Classcruiser in dry dock; the pocket battleship Lutzow, a Schlesien class battleship andthe cruiser Emden were alongside.The battleship Tirpitz is still at Wilhelmshaven and was seen on the5th February to have moved back to her old berth in the Bauhafen. TheHipper Class cruiser was seen at Brest on the 1st February, but she had probablyleft by the 3rd, though complete reconnaissance was not possible until thefollowing day when her departure was confirmed.The battle cruiser Gneisenau is said to have been seen southward bound inthe Skagerrak on the 24th January.Air reconnaissance over Cherbourg on the 2nd February showed one destroyerin port, and two large naval units of unspecified character were seen in Lorienton the 4th February.Italian.8. Air reconnaissances of Taranto on the 1st and 2nd February showed the Littorio class battleship still in dock and heavily camouflaged; there were also four cruisers and seven destroyers as well as smaller craft in the port. two cruisers were at Messina on the 1st February and one was at Naples on thefollowing day.   There were three destroyers at Tripoli on the 5th February.Submarines.9. There have been five German submarines in the North-western approaches throughout the week, exclusive of those on passage, and one or twoin the Azores-West Africa area. There were probably two Italian U-Boats inthe North-Western Approaches in the earlier part of the week but now there isonly one.   It seems unlikely that there are any in the southern area.Photographic reconnaissances of Lorient on the 1st and 4th February showedeight and five submarines present respectively.Raiders.10. It now seems likely that one of the two ships which attacked thes.s. Eurylochus 700 miles west of Freetown on the 29th January may have been the admiral Scheer. It is possible that she has been in the South Atlantic sinceshe was last heard of on the 18th December. Two ships which are now overduemay have fallen victims to these raiders. There have been raider signals though not of a very definite character, from near the Azores. There have been indicationsfrom D/F that the raider in the Southern Ocean is moving north-eastwardsand that the ship which attacked the Mandasor on the 24th January had movedwest of the Seychelles by the 4th February. It is estimated that there may beas many as seven raiders at large including the A admiral Scheer, but not includingthe Hipper Class cruiser from Brest.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. During the period the 30th January to the 5th February, 16 ships and2 small craft, a total of 78,058 tons, have been reported sunk and of these 12 ships and the 2 small craft (60,612 tons) were British.[22204] b
British Minelaying.14. The only Naval minelaying operation in the period under review wascarried out by H.M.S. Teviot Bank which laid 265 mines in the East coast Barrieron the 4th February. Minelaying by aircraft has been mainly confined to theFrench Atlantic coast.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.15. On the 31st January and the 3rd February daylight minelaying raids were carried out by enemy aircraft over the Thames Estuary, particularly in theBarrow Deep. On the first day twenty-four mines were seen to drop, butas visibility was bad there may have been more; on the second occasion eighteenwere seen. Minelaying has also been suspected on more than one night off milford haven and in the upper Bristol Channel area. Raids, some of them certainlyminelaying, were intense in the Humber area during the evening of the4th February.Eight ships have been mined in Home Waters during the past week, of which only one, an Oropesa Trawler, was sunk. Three of the casualties were in milford haven, two off Liverpool, one in the Thames Estuary, and one off Falmouth. one ship, the s.s. Gwynwood, 1,177 tons, was sunk -by a mine which dropped on herwhile she lay at anchor in the convoy anchorage in the Humber during the evening of the 4th February; she had been damaged by air.attack a few days previously.Seven ships (40,643 tons) were sunk by U-Boat, all in the North-western approaches, three of them being in the homeward bound convoy reported attackedlast week. Eight ships and two small craft (31,692 tons) were sunk by aircraft and of these all except the s.s. Meriones, which was aground on &quot;the Haisboro, andthe s.s. Sultan, which was attacked off Harwich, were sunk to the west and north-west of Ireland. One ship (5,723 tons) was sunk by a raider 800 miles west ofFreetown.Thirteen ships are reported damaged including ten British; of the total,seven were damaged by air attack and five by mine. The Norwegian s.s. -Eikhaugwhich was damaged off Land&apos;s End shot down the aircraft which attacked her.Convoys were attacked off the east coast on five days in the week, but apartfrom one ship sunk on the 3rd and an escorting trawler on the 5th, no damage hasbeen reported. On the 4th three of the attacking aircraft were shot down by-our fighters, and on the 5th one was shot down by fighters and one by HM. TrawlerLady Philomena. .Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. During the week ending Wednesday 5th February, 649 ships, including122 Allied and 28 Neutral, were convoyed, and of these, seven ships were lost by enemy action. Since the start of the war 221 ^ships have been lost in convoy or one ship in every 236.One battleship, ten armed merchant cruisers, forty-three destroyers,-thirty-nine sloops and corvettes and one submarine were employed on escort duties.13. Owing to three convoys having been delayed by bad weather, fewerships have arrived this week and the imports have again fallen considerably.Only 419,826 tons have been brought into the country compared with 474,190 tonslast week. :Oil imports, in eleven tankers, totalled 112,598 tons and showed anincrease over the 97,105 tons of last week, but cereal imports amounted to no more than 29,269 tons compared with 73,321 tons in the previous week, three ships only being fully laden with wheat. Other food imports were 39^547 tons compared with 74,104 tons, but four ships brought 23,256 tons of sugar. mineral imports totalled 148,949 tons, the corresponding figure for last week being 155,229tons. Three ships were fully laden with phosphates. General cargoes andsundries totalled 44,377 tons and the cargoes of three ships included aircraft.
Seventeen mines, ten of them in the,Thames Estuary, have been detonatedby LL Sweep during the week; twelve mines, nine of them in the Liverpool area,have been detonated by S.A. Type A, and S.A. Type C has detonated five offMilford Haven. No contact mines have been swept during the week. The minetotals to date are : Acoustic 207 (including 81 put up by His Majesty&apos;s ships other than Minesweepers), 904 magnetic, and 795 contact, .&apos;Many more German explosive floats, and mines of both German and Dutchtypes, have been washed ashore, of sighted off shore on the East. Coast betweenthe Tyne and Aberdeen, and on the East Coasts of the Orkneys and Shetlands.Searches are being carried out to confirm or disprove the existence of an enemyminefield, but it is considered possible that the floats and mines could have driftedacross the North Sea from the known German minefields between Norway and holland since the heavy easterly gales. If this is so, the apparent newness of somewould suggest that the fields have lately been reinforced.It has now been established that the loss of the LL Trawler Desiree in the thames Estuary on the 16th January was not due to a mine but to the fact thatshe struck a wreck.Mediterranean.16. In the Suez Canal 3 ships have been damaged by mines which have been laid by German aircraft on four occasions during the week, and in conseqxiencetraffic has been interrupted and the Canal is at present closed.3 D.W.I. aircraft and 4 minesweeping whalers which had been sent out in anticipation of such an emergency are being employed in sweeping, and up tothe present 14 magnetic mines have been detonated.It is anticipated that normal traffic in the Canal will be resumed in about 15 days.:Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.17. The s.s. Turkheim sent out an SOS on the 30th January, giving aposition off the Swedish coast north of Gothenburg.The Tubingen, 5,453 tons, is reported to have arrived at Oslo during Januarywith a cargo of ore, which was being unloaded before she docked ior repairs. . Herbows were seriously damaged owing to her having rammed a rock in mistake for aBritish submarine.The Gerda Vith, 1,312 tons, and the Leesee, 2,642 tons, are apparentlypreparing to sail from Vigo, and twenty German seamen have arrived therefor them.The Portland, 7,132 tons, speed 14 knots, sailed from Talcahuano on the30th January for an unknown destination. She has recently loaded largequantities of food-stuffs, 500 tons of wool, and lubricating and diesel oils. She hasnot been located since she sailed.Italian.18. Since the 28th January at least eight or nine merchant ships havebeen either sunk or seriously damaged in the Mediterranean. Reports ofsinkings, particularly by Greek submarines, tend to come in slowly, and the losses may turn out to be heavier. The Greek Ministry of Marine has announcedthat the Greek S/m. Papanieolis torpedoed a heaviiy-laden 10,000-ton Italiansteamer which was escorted by warships off Brindisi during the night of the28th/29th January. Two transports are reported to have been sunk by anunindentified submarine near the Yugoslav island of Vis on the 2nd February.A report from Split says that a ship of 10,000-12,000 tons was at Anconain Sicily on the 26th January loading food and ammunition which it was thoughtwere destined for Albania. . She was expected to sail on the 29th January.
The tanker Giulio Giordani, 10,700 tons, is reported to have struck a minewhen entering Tarantb last June and in consequence. to have been in dock for two months.  She is said to be still at Taranto.British Contraband Control.19. During the month of January 3,120 tons of cargo intended for the enemy were seized in prize, the main items being 3,046 tons of hides, skins and leather,and 52 tons of textiles. The total seizures since the beginning of the war nowamount to 757,980 tons.U.S.A.20. The U.S. Pacific Fleet has been, in the main, concentrated at PearlHarbour, Honolulu, since the 31st January. The concentration consisted of elevenbattleships, five aircraft carriers, nine heavy cruisers, nine light cruisers and twoflotillas of destroyers. The Asiatic Fleet consisting of three cruisers, 15 destroyers and twenty-four submarines is in the Manila area.The Far East.21. The rumours of the cancellation of Japanese merchant ship sailingsand the requisitioning of ships have not been confirmed, either from our ownsources in the Far East or by the U.S. Naval Authorities.A Japanese Naval Mission has left for Lisbon in the s.s. Asaku Maru,7,399 tons. The ship, which,has a naval crew and flies the Japanese Naval Flag,is due at Panama on the 7th February and Lisbon on the 20th February.It is thought very likely that it is intended to use this ship to bring backmachinery which is too large to be sent from Germany by the Trans-siberian railway.   The machinery is needed for new Japanese Naval construction.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany: Reports of troop concentrations.In Norway.22. The number of German troops in Northern Norway, viz., 3-4 divisions,is considered larger than is necessary for mere garrison purposes, but not excessiveas a safeguard against a possible Russian move, or against a British landingwhich the Germans are said to expect. There is no definite indication of anychange in the number of German divisions in this area or of any excessive amountof shipping in North Norwegian ports, such as might point to an expedition toIceland, Ireland, or the North of Scotland.Invasion.23. Reports of invasion in the Spring according to some sources inFebruary are being received in increasing numbers from various quarters.Many of them mention details of preparations, such as training of parachutists,manufacture of parachutes and of water and fire proof suits, the issue of Britishuniforms to German troops, and intensive manufacture of gas.Two reports suggest that the main attack will come across the Channel,which will be closed at its narrowest point to form a lane of approach.In Belgium.24. Reports of German troop concentrations in Belgium have also beenreceived recently, but these are not confirmed.In Italy.25. Reports of tJhe presence of German troops are still conflicting, but it now seems probable that there are possibly 2 or 3 divisions, including armouredand motorised units, in Southern Italy and Sicily.
Recent unconfirmed reports state that the Germans have taken over controlof the port of Genoa and possibly of certain other Italian ports. German controlof ports would doubtless be one of the conditions required if Germany intended toattack Malta or if an expedition to Tunisia or Libya were contemplated.In Roumania. , ,26. The number of German divisions in Roumania is now thought to be atleast 15, of which 3 or 4 are armoured and 2 or 3 motorised. This is an increaseof some 5 divisions during the past week. Five divisions and a mountain unitare believed to be distributed along the Danube between Turnu- Severin andCalarasi, 3 divisions in the Dobruja and 2 or 3 in Moldavia and on River Siret.The Roumanian Banat is at present believed to be free of German troops.In Bulgaria.27. German troops are reported to be moving into Eastern Bulgaria, but noreliable evidence as to the extent or rate of the movement, if it is taking place, is so far available. Reports that schools in the Sofia area are being vacated and thatthe Bulgarians are withdrawing troops from the Turkish frontier may bothindicate that space is being made for German troops.Roumania.28. The Roumanian Army is now reported to consist of 19 infantry divisions, 4 cavalry brigades, 4 mountain brigades, 2 fortifications brigades and1 mechanised brigade. None of these formations is at full strength and thenumber of men still with the colours is thought to be about 250,000.It is reported that the army is to be mobilised in February and March. Thisreport should be treated with reserve, but, if it is correct, the strength would beraised to about 500,000 men during those months.Africa.Libya.29.   Leading elements of our forces entered Cirene on the 3rd.February.Egypt.30. 12,400 Australians, including an infantry brigade, a M.G. battalionand a light A.A. regiment and 300 New Zealanders, have arrived at Suez.Sudan.31. On the 1st February troops of our northern column occupied Agordat,and are now closing in on the strongly held positions about Keren. As a resultof our pressure on Biarentu the enemy withdrew to the south-east on the night of the lst/2nd February; we occupied the town on the morning of the2nd February and are pressing the enemy vigorously in the Tole area.In the various operations based on the Sudan our casualties have been light.We have taken about 1,500 prisoners, mostly Italian, and considerable militarymaterial.East Africa.32. East of Lake Rudolf, our troops have occupied El Gummu and Gorai(28 miles north-east of Dukana), and over the Somaliland border, Beles Gugani(50 miles north-west of Kismayu). In all sectors the enemy have sustainedcasualties disproportionate to our own, which have been negligible.Seychelles.33. The personnel of a Coast Defence Battery of the Ceylon GarrisonArtillery has arrived in Seychelles to man two 6-inch naval guns.&quot; [22204] c
 5 : AIR SITUATION;General Review. (% .,34. In the Metropolitan area our operations as well as those of the enemy were on a small scale because of bad weather.In Africa, our aircraft again co-operated very closely with our ground forces and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.The enemy made a heavy attack on Malta.Operational aircraft casualties and extracts from recent Raid AssessmentReports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied Territory.35. Weather conditions were again unfavourable. Bomber Command flew38 sorties by day and 187 by night (155 on the 4th/5th) and Coastal Command19 by day and 25 by night.&apos; 36. Five offensive day patrols were carried out over France and Belgiumby our fighters, which sometimes escorted formations of bombers. Attacks weremade on several objectives including docks and shipping at Boulogne. Severalenemy aircraft were encountered, five of which were destroyed and one damaged.Our losses were ten aircraft destroyed or missing. Daylight attacks on enemy aerodromes included a very successful attack on St. Omer.37. The naval dockyard at Brest was attacked on four successive nights.The attack on the night of the 4th/5th February by 24 Wellingtons was particularly heavy, 23 tons of high explosive bombs and 600 incendiaries being dropped; results could not be accurately observed. Other targets attacked on the4th/5th included the docks at Cherbourg, where several direct hits were scoredon shipping and on the shipbuilding yard, the Merignac aerodrome near Bordeauxwhere bombs fell near the hangars, and the industrial area of Dusseldorf onwhich 24 Wellingtons dropped 17 tons of bombs and 1,600 incendiaries. Severalaerodromes in occupied territory and the Channel ports were also effectivelybombed during the week.United Kingdom.38. The enemy was more active by day than he was in the previous week.Most of the aircraft were engaged on coastal reconnaissances, but others, taking advantage of low cloud conditions, flew inland and bombed places in the london area, in the Home Counties and in East Anglia. On five nights there was little or no enemy activity, but on the nights of the 4th/5th and 5th/6th Februarythere were attacks by about 100 and by about 60 enemy aircraft respectively,the former not being directed against any particular area and the latter againstSouth-East England. Fighter Command flew 404 patrols involving 1,385 sortiesby day and 88 patrols involving 95 sorties by night; nine enemy aircraft were destroyed by day, and one at night.Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying.39. The activities of the Coastal Command were again restricted becauseof adverse weather conditions, but 164 patrols involving 376 sorties were flownincluding 221 convoy escorts. A number of photographic reconnaissances of several ports extending from Bergen to Bordeaux were also flown. Our aircraftsuccessfully laid mines off St. Nazaire, Lorient and Brest.40. There was hardly any minelaying by enemy aircraft on the first five nights of the week, but on the remaining nights they were unusually active,176 aircraft being engaged. Enemy coastal activity was again relatively small,but the long-range unit maintained operations over the Atlantic.Egypt and Libya.41. Our bomber aircraft have continued to carry out heavy attacks on enemy aerodromes, especially at Barce and Castel Benito (Tripoli), on which 10 tonsand 12 tons of bombs were dropped respectively.   Considerable damage was done
to hangars and barracks and at least eight enemy aircraft were destroyed on theground. Our fighter aircraft made several machine-gun attacks on enemy troops,transport vehicles and landing grounds; causing considerable damage and heavy casualties. At Barce Hurricanes destroyed as many as thirty-six vehicles. the harbour at Tripoli was heavily attacked on the night of the 31st January by sixWellingtons from Malta and direct hits were scored on seaplane hangars and on shipping. The only enemy air activity, apart from two attacks on ships and the laying, of mines in the Suez Canal by German aircraft, referred to in the naval situation, consisted of an abortive attack on Tmimi on the 3rd February.Malta.42. Our aircraft carried out several important reconnaissances during theweek, including the harbours at Naples, Taranto and Tripoli, and aerodromes in sicily and Libya.43. On the night of the 31st January/1st February two enemy aircraftdropped bombs near the Grand Harbour without causing damage or casualties.On the following day an enemy bomber, escorted by twelve fighters, flew over the island, but they were intercepted by our fighters and two were shot down. Onthe night of the 4th/5th there was a heavy attack on the dockyard and aerodromes by three large formations of enemy dive bombers. At Luqa andHal Far there was considerable damage to buildings and a few casualties. three enemy aircraft were destroyed by our fighters and anti-aircraft defences, andanother was probably destroyed. Our losses were three aircraft destroyed and four damaged on the ground.Greece and Albania.44. On the 31st January six Blenheims heavily bombed an enemy troopconcentration at Dukaj near Tepelene, and inflicted heavy casualties. On thefollowing day over two tons of bombs were dropped on warehouses and munitiondumps at Valona.Sudan and East Africa.45. Our aircraft continued to harass the communications of the retreatingenemy and several heavy attacks were made on his troops and transport, especiallyin the neighbourhood of Agordat, Barentu and Keren. Particular attention was paid to the railway between Agordat and Massawa, which was heavily bombedin five places, and to the railway from Addis Ababa to Jibuti, which was bombedtwice. Enemy aerodromes were also successfully attacked and several aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Assab was successfully bombed on the 1st Feb-ruary. Several reconnaissances were flown, and escorts provided for a convoy.Enemy activity was negligible and consisted of unsuccessful bombing attacks onour positions near the Kenya-Somaliland Frontier.Air Intelligence.Germany.46. It is probable that the German Air Force strength in the Mediterraneanis less by some forty long-range bombers than was estimated last week.French North Africa.47.   The air defences of Tunis and Bizerta are apparently being reinforced.China.48. Both Mekong bridges on the Burma Road have now been put out ofaction by Japanese bombers, but, though some congestion has been caused, apontoon bridge was in use within twenty-four hours.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.49. The weather has again restricted enemy bombing. On the 30th and31st January the enemy was fairly active. Tor the remainder of the week theyconfined themselves to occasional bombing of aerodromes, east and north-ea^st coast towns, and London.50. On the 30th January raids were carried out in areas east of a line fromthe Humber to the Isle of Wight, concentrating chiefly on London, where somehouses were demolished. Slight damage was caused by scattered bombing in east anglia and Kent, but bombs falling at Eye blocked both railway lines betweenPeterborough and Wisbech.51. On the 31st January bombing occurred in much the same areas, Londonagain being the chief objective. More casualties (28 killed) were caused thanon any day since the 25th October. There was a 20-pump fire at Taylor&apos;sFurniture Depository in Southwark and three Hospitals and the Albany StreetBarracks were hit. Damage was caused at Mullards Radio Transmission Equip-ment, Co., Wandsworth, but production was little affected.52.   Outside London there were few casualties and little damage.By Night.53.   On four nights during the week no bombs were dropped.54. On night of the 3rd/4th February bombing was confined to an incen-diary attack on London, which did little damage, and to the dropping of a fewbombs at Uffington and East Dereham.55. On the night of the 4th/5th February bombs were scattered widely overthe eastern and East Midland Counties and Kent. Damage and casualties were generally small, but at Grantham the British Manufacturing and Research Co.(Guns and Ammunition) was extensively damaged. It is expected that partproduction will be resumed at an early date. The heaviest casualties were atSouthend, where bombs fell in the centre of the town.56. On the last night of the week, 5th/6th February, 8 London Boroughswere bombed, but damage and casualties were slight. Outside London 2 paraminesexploded at Bradwell, East Suffolk, causing serious damage to private property,but there were no casualties.R.A .F. A aerodromes.57. Nine Aerodromes in the south-east were hit, but damage was notsevere except at Feltwell, Norfolk, where the administrative buildings sufferedextensively.Casualties.58. For the week ending 0600 on the 5th February the approximate figuresfor the whole country are 130 killed and 303 injured. These figures include theLondon casualties of 72 killed and 226 injured.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Wilhelmshaven. A reliable report stated that the damage was considerable and gave a specific instance of the destruction of three naval barracks withsevere casualties. This report was confirmed by photographs taken by P.R.U.,which disclosed major damage and that such damage is for the most part confined to the Bauhafen area. In the photographic interpretation 17 different items of damage are particularised, comprising gun and clothing stores, carpenters&apos;and boiler-makers&apos; shops, a navigation office and a smithery, the town barracks,the fire station and the post office, and buildings in the Kaiser, Victoria and RoonStrassen.Cologne. About the end of December the main station was badly damaged and a bomb which just missed the Hohenzollern Bridge caused many casualties.Berlin. The damage caused to the U-Bahn in the Tauentzien Strasse onthe 15th/16th December had not been fully repaired by the 14th January. a bomb which fell on a house in the Steinplatz caused the death of 26 persons.Dusseldorf. On the 28th/29th December a gasometer received twodirect hits.Politz. Two reports were received from sources believed reliable statingthat heavy damage had been caused to the synthetic oil plant. No details weregiven, but, in view of several reports received of results of attacks upon this target, it is considered the attacks must have been successful, although details arenot known.General. The account of a Swedish sailor shows the lengths to which theGermans go in their efforts to remove and conceal damage. He stated that just before Christmas direct hits destroyed a whole block of Bremen houses. Clearingoperations were started immediately and by Christmas Eve the site of thebuildings had been converted into an open square upon which Christmas treeswere being sold. When passing through a lock where a bomb had heavily damaged the middle sector the ship&apos;s pilot maintained that the sector was too narrow andwas therefore being widened. Building operations were, in fact, already inprogress to make it look as though this was being done.France,An informant saw the remains of a munition train at Rennes and of anotherat Le Mans, which had received direct hits. There was little left to describe. he told of a highly successful raid on Villacoublay aerodrome when bomb-loadingoperations were in progress.  Many aircraft were destroyed on the ground.
