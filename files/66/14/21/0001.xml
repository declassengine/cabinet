We do not recommend that the Government should assume complete control of the B.B.C.2.     &apos;   We consider that the present difficulties would be mitigated if&apos; two new officers were to be appointed to theB.B.C. - the first to occupy the position of   generaladviser on home news and talks and the second to occupy the position of foreign adviser*The general adviser would be responsible for allhome news and talks and the B.B.C.  staff occupied withthese matters would be under his immediate direction tothe extent of his responsibilities.    Similarly, the foreignadviser would be responsible for the foreign broadcastsand the appropriate B.B.C.  staff would be under hisdirection as above.3. We contemplate that each of these two officers shouldhave the supreme direction in his own particular sphere andthat,  in the event of arsy dispute arising with the director general, the question at issue should be decided by theMinister of Information,r4. With regard to foreign broadcasts and matters whereforeign policy.is involved,  a suitable arrangement shouldbe -made between the Ministry of Information, the ForeignOffice and the B.
