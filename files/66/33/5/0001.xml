(43) 5.January 4, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.INDIA.TREATMENT OF GANDHI IF HE UNDERTAKES A FAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.BY Minute 3 of W.M. (42) 121st Conclusions, dated the 7th September, 1942,the War Cabinet approved arrangements (as set out in my memorandum .P. (42) 394) to be followed by the Indian authorities in the event of Gandhideclaring a fast. Briefly the intention was that he should not be released, but beinformed that Government would not interfere; that he should be provided withall medical facilities, and allowed the company of his eldest son and visits froma limited number of friends from outside subject to such restrictions as would effectively limit his freedom to communicate with the outside world. I now circulate as Annexures A, B and C respectively copies of the Viceroy&apos;s telegramof the 22nd December and of the Governor of Bombay&apos;s letters of the 22nd october and 4th November, referred to therein.2. Sir R. Lumley&apos;s objections to the arrangements contemplated are asfollows :  (a) He and his officers are convinced that though  the  precautionarydispositions of military and police would have to be on much the sames cale whether Gandhi was released or kept under detention afterbeginning to fast, in the event of his dying while under detention therewould be very serious demonstrations in the Province of an ugliertemper than in the other case calling for the employment of strongmilitary forces.(b) If his fast were to coincide, for example, with a Japanese invasion, therewould be no alternative to keeping Gandhi in detention. On the otherhand, if the fast were to be staged now, with the object of whippingup the diminishing vigour of the revolutionary movement, the adverseconsequences of his release, considerable though they might be, wouldnot be so great or so prolonged as those which would follow his deathunder detention. The reaction to his death from a fast while under detention is going to be so formidable that it should not be allowedto happen except under extreme circumtances.(e) Even if Gandhi&apos;s son accepted the role proposed for him, which seemsvery improbable, no reliance could be placed on undertakings byvisitors to abstain from publicity about Gandhi&apos;s condition. Thereis no prospect whatever of Gandhi not becoming front-page news ifihe fasts, still less if he dies,(d) As to the possibility of flying Gandhi to a place outside India shouldhe choose the moment of attempted Japanese invasion to fast, his death   under   detention   outside   India   would   produce   equally[24856] b
unfavourable reactions there, while the risk of his dying whilefasting en route would, in the condition of health mentioned in (e),be considerable.(e) Gandhi&apos;s (decision to fast might possibly be concealed from the public for three to four days provided outside specialists were not called in,but owing to his high blood pressure medical opinion doubts his being able to survive three days&apos; fasting.3. Under pressure of these objections the Viceroy feels obliged to revert tohis view&apos; that Gandhi should be given his liberty as soon as his fast reaches a danger point. This, it will be recalled, was the view also of the great majority of provincial Governors and of the Viceroy&apos;s Council. It is supported, by theconsideration that the unconditional release of Gandhi on previous occasions when he has prosecuted a fast to the danger point has not been publicly regardedas a victory over Government and that there is no reason to believe that thepublic&apos;s reaction would not be the same in the present (up-to-date hypothetical)case.4. My own feeling, and that of the Viceroy personally, would favour talcinga firm line with Gandhi. But it is the Governor-General in Council that we haveto deal with, and apart from the difficulties involved in overruling the Council, itis the Viceroy and the Goveimors who would have to face the consequences inIndia and we must accept their view of what the consequences are likely to be.I submit therefore that the Viceroy&apos;s present proposals should be accepted,should the issue be forced upon us.5. As this memorandum is sent to print a telegram* has just arrived from Lord Linlithgow transmitting the text of a letter to him from Gandhi whichends with a clear hint that he finds it expedient to stage a fast, and that soon.I shall inform my colleagues further as soon as I have the Governor-General&apos;views on this development.L. S. A.India Office,January 4, 1943.* Telegram No. 22-S.C, January 3, circulated separately.ANNEXURE A.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India. DatedNezv Delhi, December 22, 1942.3566-S.   Personal. &apos;YOUR personal telegram of 8th September No. (1 15753) and connectedcorrespondence. Fast by Gandhi. I have since had Lumley&apos;s letter of22nd October (copy by bag of 27th October) and his further letter of 4th November(copy by bag of 24th November). I have considered these letters, which containvery careful analysis of position with Maxwell, and in the light of his views, andthose of Home Department, I fear that with (? regret) I must accept Lumley&apos;s objections to suggested procedure as fatal [sic&apos;]. We do.not think it would be justifiable to force Lumley to take the very grave risks which he anticipates as likely to result from that policy, and it is tolerably clear from his letter thatthere would be almost insuperable difficulties in working it in (1 the) manner proposed or in securing advantages which I had hoped from it.2. If that view is accepted we are, I fear, though with very great reluctance,driven back to contemplating Gandhi&apos;s release before his fast becomes fatal.Situation is to some extent altered by the Surgeon-General&apos;s opinion mentioned inparagraph No. 8 (e) of Lumley&apos;s letter of 22nd October, that Gandhi wouldprobably not recover from a fast lasting more than three or four days. That, tosome extent, reduces difficulties of situation, since there would be less time towhip up popular excitement before the critical stage is reached, and it is arguable that in those circumstances no really useful object would be served by concealingfast from public, as I suggested to Lumley in my telegram of 31st October (copyby bag of 24th November), unless, of course, circumstances were such as to make this course essential. In his present state of health it is always possible that onsuch a plan we might be caught out by a sudden collapse, when we should beblamed for not having let the public know.
q3. It will, I think, be necessary to retain Gandhi at the Agha Khan&apos;s Palacewhen fast starts rather than attempt to transfer him to Wardha or any otherplace, since his possible death on the journey would be, to say the least of it,embarrassing. Procedure as we conceive it would be to remove guards fromthe Palace and inform Gandhi that he was a free man.4. I am myself rather inclined to agree with Lumley&apos;s view, that Gandhiis not at present intending a fast, Its attractiveness will be considerably lost ifhe knows, as he probably does, that he could not last for more than a few days,and I am told on good authority that he got a real fright on the occasion of his last fast, when he was released only after he had himself given up hope. It isimpossible to be certain what he may do, particularly if anything happenedspecially to upset him. But there seems at least some ground for hoping that thesituation may not arise. If it does, in the light of my correspondence withLumley, (? we are) now driven to releasing him from custody when medical advicetells us that danger point is approaching. If he subsequently stops fast and(? recovers)- both doubtful hypotheses-his rear rest would have to be considered,and with possibility of further fasts.  But we need not take that fence now.5. My own feelings in this matter, as you know, have been consistently infavour of taking a stiff line with Gandhi. But we have to consider repercussionsboth here and outside, and in the light of Lumley&apos;s views I hope that cabinet will feel able to reconsider. I am assured that Gandhi&apos;s release when in dangerof his life has never been publicly regarded as a victory over Government in thepast, and my advisers see no reason to believe that it would be so on present occasion. The moment for his (? release) would depend on circumstances and, perhaps, on grounds for his fast; but in any case I should propose to announce the release in a suitable communique, drawing attention, amongst other things, to Gandhi&apos;s own condemnation of hunger-striking, and hinting at theundue advantage he was taking of fact that he had always been treated by government with special personal consideration. I should also propose to bring out the point that he had been detained in order to prevent him from leadingthe mass movement, and that need, for such detention no longer existed when hewas physically incapable of doing so. Indeed, detention after reaching that stage would be punitive rather than preventive in character.ANNEXURE B.(Most Secret and Personal.)(No. 294-H.E.) Government House,My dear Linlithgow, Bombay, October 22, 1942.I WRITE in connection with your personal telegram No. 368-SC, datedthe 30th September, which was sent by post, and which deals with arrangements in case Gandhi should start to fast. Fortunately, as there is still no sign thathe contemplates a fast, it is possible to consider this matter without a pressingsense of urgency. I have therefore taken some time to consider it and I have discussed it, most confidentially, with a few officers principally concerned.2. I am beginning to entertain the belief that Gandhi is now unlikely to fast,at any rate, for some time to come; but we can only guess at the way his mind is working, and he has so often taken an unexpected and. apparently illogical course,and external events might so easily change any calculations we may make, that wecannot afford to rule out the possibility of a fast, and I fully agree with theimportance of having our plan of action thought out in advance as far as possible.It is, too, of much importance to my Government, which will have to carry outthe policy finally decided upon, to be clear beforehand about what is to be done.3. The. conclusions described in your telegram make a radical change from what has previously been contemplated, in that they propose not to release Gandhiwhen he reaches danger point but to continue to keep him in custody even until hedies. I have already expressed, in my private and personal telegram No. 548 ofthe 8th August last, my personal views as to the reactions which would followif we allowed Gandhi to fast to death under arrest. I have no reason to alter the views which I expressed in that telegram, and I must make it clear beyond,doubt that, if Gandhi dies under arrest, we must be prepared to meet a veryserious situation in this province.. That is the view also of the officials with[24856] b 2
whom I have discussed these proposals. Some of them, go further than I do andexpect that attacks on Government ofhcers would take place on a very large scale.I need not labour the point, but I have no doubt at all that the reaction wouldbe so strong that considerable forces would be required to meet it, and for aconsiderable time.4. The undoubted seriousness of the reaction to be expected and particularly the prolonged effect on&quot; the Indian attitude to the war, convinces me that we should,not risk that reaction except in circumstances which allow of no alternative. If,for instance, Gandhi staged a fast at a time when the Japanese were trying to invade India, there would, in my judgment, be no alternative but&apos; to keep him in custody. On the other hand, if he weie to begin a fast npw when the presentmovement might be held to be languishing, and with the object, possibly, of givingit greater momentum, the disadvantages of releasing him, considerable though they would be, would in my view be not nearly so great and probably not soprolonged as those which would follow his death under detention. These twoexamples do not, of course, exhaust the possibilities, but I use them to illustratemy point that the reaction to Gandhi&apos;s death, from a fast, under detention, is going to be so formidable that we ought not to allow it to happen except underextreme circumstances. I would therefore urge most strongly that we shouldnot commit ourselves to a decision not to release him if he fasts, but that, whileperfecting our plans in case that decision has to be made, we should await thecircumstances, and regard it as the resort to be used only where there is no alternative.5. I have, in the preceding paragraph, endeavoured to make my view clearabout the main change which your telegram proposes. Examination, however, ofthe mechanics of the proposals tends also to confirm my view against the change,for I have considerable doubts whether they will prove effective in securing the objects which they are designed to secure. I understand the main objects to &quot;be tokeep Gandhi cut off from outside contact and from securing that publicity onwhich he thrives and of which he has been largely deprived since his detention.I believe, in the first place, that the proposals will not work. As soon as Gandhistarts to fast it will be the purpose of all those connected with him to securehis immediate release in the hope that he may be induced to give up his fast, oncehe is at liberty. Devadas Gandhi will almost certainly believe that, by accepting the mission proposed for him, he will be playing the Government^ game, and i feel certain he will refuse and will devote all bis energies towards mobilisingopinion to demand his father&apos;s release. If he takes that line, no other personclosely connected with Gandhi will take on the role which Devadas has rejected.That is very likely to be the first hitch, and we should not succeed in our effort toshow.that, except for release, every kind of decency, including the presence of hisson, is being extended to him. Even if Devadas accepts the mission, it would be,I am certain, useless to count on the proposed bond to prevent publicity of whatwould be going on inside the Aga Khan&apos;s palace. Even though those who went to see him might refrain from giving direct interviews to the Press, everyone ofthem would talk and the newspapers would be full of anonymous but inspiredversions of what was going on. We can certainly succeed in preventing news-paper correspondents from having access to Gandhi, but we could never preventnewspapers from carrying as much indirect news of him, and probably indirectmessages from him, as they wanted. Indeed, I will go so far as to say that thewhole conception that, by keeping Gandhi in custody, we shall be depriving him of publicity, is a delusion. Once he begins to fast, whether those who have access tohim talk or not, his fast will be the only front-page news, in all Indian newspapers,and still more so if he dies. If it is argued that, though we cannot deny himpublicity we can limit his communications with the outside world, again I would say that we are unlikely to do so effectively. Either those who visit him will, inspite of their bond, talk, or the newspapers will put their own construction on what they believe Gandhi would like to pass out, and the effect on the public willbe much the same. In short, I do not believe that the proposals now made willwork, and, in so far as they seek to deny publicity to Gandhi or to limit his communications with the outside world, they would not be effective, even if theycould be put into operation. It would, therefore, be a very small counter whichwe would be throwing into the balance against the heavy weight of the reactionwhich his death in detention would bring us, and at the most the counter wouldlast for a week or two while the reaction would be very prolonged.6. It is also urged on behalf of the new proposals that serious problems ofpublic order might arise if he were released and continued to fast, and by implication that these problems would not arise if he were continued in custody.
I am unable to agree with this implication, and certainly those responsible for lawand order in Poona do not expect to be relieved of any problems of public orderif he is not to be released. While it is true that there might be great pilgrimagesto dissuade him from fasting, if he were released there might be pilgrimages in adifferent temper, to force his release if he remained in detention. We have forsome time had ready a scheme of military and police dispositions in Poona tocontrol great crowds who might try and reach the Aga Khan&apos;s palace once a fastbegan. The dispositions will have to be much the same whether he is in or out of detention, and the problem of public order is the same in either case, except thatthe public temper is likely to be much worse if he were not released.7. I, therefore, have serious doubts whether these proposals will secure their objects. The problems of public order which they will produce willcertain be no less. I fail to see how they would result in control of the Press.I do not think they would effectively limit Gandhi&apos;s communication with the outside world, or, to be more accm*ate, that they would prevent Gandhi fromproviding the maximum of inspiration and incitation to his own countrymenand the maximum of sensational news to the outside world. I would ratherface the fact that if Gandhi fasts there is no way of preventing it from being exploited to the full. That further confirms me in my view that we should, be wise not to allow him to die in our hands except in circumstances which allow of no alternative, for there are only the slenderest and most temporary advantages to be set against the really formidable problems with which his death in those circumstances would face us.8. I trust that these arguments will receive consideration, but if thedecision is made not to release, we shall in this province make the best of it,and there are one or two minor points which need to be cleared up : (a) Nothing is said in your telegram about publicity by Government. OnceDevadas is approached, the fast will be public property. I suggestthat the Government of India should immediately announce the fastand make known the facilities which will be given to Gandhi, and thereafter give frequent communiques.(&amp;) Although I expect that Devadas will refuse and that no one else will accept the mission, it would be advisable to have a second and thirdchoice in mind so that we can know as early as possible whether that part of the scheme will work. We should also decide what is to happen if it does not work.(c) The telegram proposes that the selection of names of visitors will beleft to Devadas Gandhi.    Would he be allowed to include otherdetenus ?   The  first  person  Gandhi  will  want  to  see  will  beVallabhbhai Patel.   I do not think that should be allowed, but the* point should be settled beforehand.(d) As I am quite certain that we should have to meet a very serious situation, far more serious than what has arisen hitherto, I have begun to concert with the District Commander ways in which troops could be disposed to the best advantage throughout the province assoon as a fast becomes certain. At the present moment, there area welcome number of troops available, but many of them may goelsewhere before this eventuality arises. I therefore take this early opportunity of saying that in this province we shall need very con-siderable support&apos;from the Army and that I hope the strength oftroops on whom a call could be made will be diminished as little aspossible. I do not know whether our need will be greater than thatof other Provinces, but I tJhink it should be remembered: that Gujaratis Gandhi&apos;s principal stronghold, that Bombay City is in a large measure devoted to him, and that the centre of events will be Poona;for all these reasons it would be a wise precaution to expect a majorexplosion in this Province.(e) If, on the other hand, it is eventually decided to release Gandhi when hiscondition approaches the danger point, I would emphasise that theadvice given to me by the Surgeon-General, who attended Gandhiduring his last Yervada fast, is that at his age and with his bloodpressure, a very quick deterioration is likely to set in. He thinks that it would probably not be wise to expect that he could get throughmore than 3 or 4 days without reaching a state from which he wouldprobably not recover. If, therefore, we do decide on a policy of release,there is not likely to be too much time for deliberation.
9. In conclusion, I still have a good deal of expectation that there will bono fast; but if -we are unfortunate, and Gandhi stages one, I do not think weshould be under any illusion that it would not be a matter of the gravest character,with very serious effects on the whole war effort in India, should he die in detention. For that reason I think we ought to go a long way to avoid that development, the more so since I have doubts whether the new conclusions,described in your telegram, will have much chance of effecting their purpose.Yours sincerely,(Signed) ROGER LUMLEY.His Excellency the Viceroy andGovernor-General of India.ANNEXURE C.(No. 295-H.E.   Secret and Personal.) Government House, Bombay.My dear Linlithgow, November 4, 1942.I WRITE in connection with your private and personal telegram No. 3111-S,dated the 31st October,* which deals further with the question of the arrange-ments to be made if Gandhi were to begin a fast.2. With regard to the suggestion that if he should declare a fast at a mount of real military difficulty we should at once fly him to Aden or Africa,I would not be in favour of this course if he had already started a fast. In that event, he would probably have to be carried out of the house and at the aerodrome.This would almost certainly become known, and, I think, the idea of flying a man of his age, who was fasting, would create a worse impression than if he were todie in custody where he is at present. It would be a different question if he wereto give notice that he was going to fast and we were able to fly him away before he began. There is, I feel, much to be said, at first glance, in moving him outof India before he fasts at a time of real military difficulty. If he fasts whenhe reaches his destination we would, at any rate, be spared, at a critical moment,the very considerable local difficulties which his fast would be bound to create.On the other hand, the reactions to his death through fasting while in detentionwould be the same whether he died in Africa or in Poona. I do not think,therefore, that there is very much to be gained by this method, and there is thedanger that he might start to fast as soon as he was moved from the Aga Khan&apos;sPalace and might die en route, and that again would, I feel, create the worstimpression. On the whole, therefore, and with some reluctance, my reaction isthat the flying proposal does not seem to have sufficient advantage in it to makeit worth while. I suppose, too, that it would not be too easy to make sure thatthe right aeroplane would be available at a moment&apos;s notice.3. With regard to the second question, I think it would be possible to conceal the fast from the public for three or four days if we decided to hold himfasting in Poona but not to allow anyone, not now in the palace, to see him. Ithink we have been successful, so far, in preventing all leakages as to what is going on in the palace, except on the occasion of Mahadev Desai&apos;s death when anoutsider came in, and, therefore, provided outsiders are excluded, I should feelfairly confident that we could preserve secrecy. That would, of course, mean thatno doctors, other than those who normally attended, would be allowed to visit him.If any doctor not accustomed to visit him were to be allowed, that fact would atonce be known and would arouse immediate speculation. However, as he isregularly visited by the Inspector-General of Prisons and by Colonel B. Z. Shah,the Superintendent of the Yeravda Mental Hospital, who has been in charge ofthe health of the inmates of the Aga Khan&apos;s Palace, there would be no lack of normal medical attention, though there would, no doubt, be much pressure fromthe other inmates for further specialists.I find it difficult to make up my mind whether this course would be expedient.It would depend, so much on the circumstances prevailing at the time, which it isvery difficult to foresee. I am inclined to think that it would always be better to make public the fact that Gandhi had started to fast rather than to keep thefact secret. It is possible, however, that the circumstances might be such thatit would appear almost essential to keep it secret for some days, and if that should be the case, I think we could manage to preserve secrecy.* Copy printed below.
7204. I asked the Inspector-General of Prisons two days ago how he thoughtGandhi was, and he replied, that in health he was certainly well and had put on some three pounds in weight since he has been in detention. I asked him, further,if he had formed any opinion as to his mental attitude, and he replied that,when he first received newspapers, he was distinctly upset over something, andthat had caused a rise in blood pressure, but that had now passed, and, though he continued to be a diligent reader of the newspapers, he had, for some time,appeared to be unworried.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      ROGER LUMLEY.His Excellency the Viceroy andGovernor-General of India.Telegram from Viceroy to Governor of Bombay, dated October 31, 1942.3111-S.   Private and Personal.   Gandhi.I am much obliged for your most helpful letter of 22nd October, whichshall have my best attention. I think you are aware that War Cabinet haveshown utmost reluctance to agree to any plan involving Gandhi&apos;s release fromdetention. I am exploring with open mind every possible course that occurs tome; and entirely agree with you that we shall be wise to think ahead but not to commit ourselves to any particular plan until we can measure the precise circum-stances in which a fast, if it comes, will occur.2. Will you please let me have by letter or telegram your reaction tosuggestion that, if Gandhi should declare a fast at a moment of real militarydifficulty, we should that very day fly him to Aden or Africa and hold him therewhether he dies or lives.3. If we decided to hold him fasting in Poona but not to allow anyone not now in the Palace to see him, do you consider that we could conceal fast fromthe public for 3 or 4 days so as to reduce to minimum duration of public tension ?Do you think this course would be expedient %
