THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET. Copy. No..W.P. (43) 41.January 27, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEYIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this documentWAR CABINET.ARGENTINE ENCROACHMENTS AGAINST CERTAIN ANTARCTICDEPENDENCIES OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE South Orkneys and South Shetlands are among the Antarcticdependencies of the Falkland Islands (see sketch map attached). We hold atitle by discovery, but are not and never have been in effective occupation. TheArgentine Government include these islands in their general Antarctic claimsand have recently taken various steps calculated to strengthen their claim.Thus, they have erected a beacon at Dallman Bay in the Melchior Group near theSouth Shetlands; painted the Argentine colours, and left other marks ofoccupation on Deception Island in the South Shetlands; and, at Laurie Islandin the South Orkneys, where they took over, with our permission, a meteorologicalstation some 35 years ago, they first established, without our permission, a wire-less telegraph station about seven years ago and have more recently opened apost office. The wireless telegraph station and post office are manned byArgentine naval ratings.2. An Argentine naval transport is expected to leave Buenos Aires for theislands on the 28th January. Her itinerary is unknown, but she is expected torelieve the Argentine ratings at Laurie Island and is not unlikely to carry outfurther acts in the other unoccupied islands calculated to strengthen theArgentine title to them.   Chilean naval officers are taking part in the trip.3. It is considered that unless steps are taken to strengthen our title tothese dependencies by effective occupation, Argentina will be able, gradually, toestablish her title by means such as those described above. A situation will bereached in which it will be impossible to dislodge her except by forceful actionamounting to aggression against Argentine territory. This situation mayalready exist at Laurie Island.4. As regards action to establish our title, no form of permanent occupationcan, for physical reasons, be attempted before the next Antarctic summer. Inthese circumstances, it has been suggested that an armed merchant cruiser (theCarnarvon Castle) should be sent on a tour of the islands, and she has alreadyreached Port Stanley on her way thither. During the tour, landings would bemade and administrative acts, including the obliteration of the evidences ofArgentine visits performed, at the islands not occupied by the Argentine (viz.,the South Shetlands and Signy and Coronation Islands of the South OrkneyGroup). On Laurie Island (where the Argentine naval ratings are) it is proposedthat a friendly landing should be made unless it appears that it will be resistedby force. In that event the Captain of the Carnarvon Castle would protest andthe ship would remain in territorial waters for more than 24 hours to asserther right to be there.    No administrative acts would be performed.    It is11955   [24956] b. 2further proposed that permanent occupation should be established next year onall the islands except (probably) Laurie Island. No publicity would be given tothe tour of the Carnarvon Castle, and it would be described in reply to anyenquiries as a search for traces of enemy raiders. Although the areas in whichthe islands concerned are situated are in the British, and not in the United Statesdefence zone,&quot; it would appear desirable, in view especially of the pan-Americanaspects of the question, to inform the United States Government immediately itis decided to take any action such as that proposed above.5. As regards the importance of these islands to us, the Admiralty emphasisethe need of denying them to enemy raiders in time of war. The Colonial Officerefer to the potential mineral wealth of the Antarctic, the undesirability ofappearing to lose interest in any part of the Colonial Empire and the importance(as to which the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries concur) of the islandsfrom the standpoint of whaling and whaling control. The Dominions Officeconsider that full consultation with the Dominions Governments would be aprecondition to any surrender of British interests in the islands, in view of theinterest of the Southern Dominions in (1) Antarctic policy, and (2) the generalprinciples* governing the transfer of sovereignty over any part of the Empire.6. The reaction of the Argentine Government, when they learn of the tourof the Carnarvon Castle, cannot be certainly predicted. His Majesty&apos;s Embassyat Buenos Aires have consistently advised that the secular, if preposterous,Argentine claims to the Falkland Islands is a matter on which all Argentines,of all classes and creeds, feel strongly: and that the same sentiment is likely toattach to the Antarctic Islands now in question, to which there is a far strongerArgentine title than there is to the Falklands. On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;sEmbassy have advised that, the Argentines being realists, actual physicaloccupation (which is a good deal more than what the Carnarvon Castle is in aposition to effect) might give less trouble than the written protest against theArgentine encroachments up to date, which the Embassy was last June instructed ,to make, but the presentation of which was postponed on account of the greaterinterest attaching to physical action if it could be taken.7. Argentina is now the only country in the Western Hemisphere to remainin diplomatic relations with our enemies. This is the result of a considered policyon the part of the reactionary Argentine Government, which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have recently publicly deplored, and for the reversal of which theUnited States Government are constantly pressing. The Argentine Governmentare in a minority in the present Parliament, but this position they hope to rectifyby rigging the forthcoming elections, which will also produce the ArgentinePresident for the coming seven-year term. The Government are at odds withconsiderable sections of their own public opinion, for reasons of internal policy:for though public opinion is overwhelmingly pro-Ally, it is not opposed to theperpetuation of the &apos;&apos; neutrality &apos;&apos; policy. It cannot be excluded, therefore, thatthe Government might attempt to use the trip of the Carnarvon Castle to rousepublic opinion against His Majesty&apos;s Government over what would be representedas an interference with Argentine sovereign rights, thus indirectly increasingnational support for their unsatisfactory international attitude and improvingtheir prospects at the forthcoming elections.8. It is less probable that they would try any action of a directly anti-Britishkind such as interfering with our vested interests or with the supply to us of thelarge quantities of meat which we are now purchasing on the American behalfas well as on our own.9. On the other hand, it is doubtful whether any moment could be morepropitious than the present for taking action. Argentina is isolated andunpopular; all the other American States are either our belligerent Allies or havebroken off diplomatic relations with the common enemy. She would find nosympathy in the Western Hemisphere should she attempt to make capital out ofthe action imposed upon us by her deliberate encroachment against these Britishpossessions.10. In these circumstances a decision is required as to whether effect shouldbe given to the proposals in paragraph 4 above, which are set out in greater detailin the two telegrams to the Governor of the Falkland Islands annexed tothis paper., A. E.Foreign Office, January 27, 1943. 3172ANNEX.(1)Telegram to Falkland Islands (Sir A. Cardinall) from Secretary of State forColonies, dated January 19, 1943.(No. 4.  Most Secret.)MY telegram No. 3.1. It has now been decided that armed merchant cruiser Carnarvon Castleshould visit Falkland Islands, take civil magistrate on board and proceed to SouthShetlands and probably South Orkneys.She is expected to &quot;arrive at Port Stanley about 22nd/23rd January and mustleave Antarctic regions for Northern waters not later than the 20th February.2. At South Shetlands a visit should be paid to Deception Island, where alltraces left by Argentine visit last year should be obliterated or removed andreplaced by marks indicating British sovereignty, e.g., British flags should beleft flying; notices of British sovereignty&apos; securely and prominently set up;huts and tanks marked; photographs should be secured and record left of visitstating date and name of ship signed by ship&apos;s Commanding Officer and CivilMagistrate. Record stated to have been left by the Argentines in a chest, iflocated, and any other removable Argentine marks should be brought back.3. Fullest possible information should be collected with a view to facilitatingthe establishment of permanent parties of occupation on Deception Island nextyear, but everything should be done to disguise our intentions in this respect, andit should be remembered that visit of Argentine transport may shortly follow.N.A. Buenos Aires 2122/13 repeated to N.O.-in-charge of Falkland Islandscontains details of the voyage of the Argentine ship.4. A visit to the South Orkneys raises the awkward question of LaurieIsland and further instructions will be sent concerning these islands.5. Expedition will be in charge of the Commanding Officer ofH.M.S. Carnarvon Castle, but Civil Magistrate should accompany naval landingparties on all the Islands and carry out suitable administrative acts.6. Destination of expedition is to be kept strictly secret, but if inquiriesregarding it are made by the Argentine Government, they will be informed thatits purpose is to investigate enemy activities in the area and to make sure thatthese Islands are not being used as a base for enemy raiders in South Atlantic.Should the Argentine transport be met with or a visit be made to Laurie Island,the action of H.M.S. Carnarvon Castle should accord with this explanation.7. The above paragraphs of this telegram are to be regarded as theinstructions for the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. Carnarvon Castle, who shouldbe handed a copy on his arrival. They have been agreed with the Admiraltyand the Foreign Office. We are relying on you to give him all necessary generalinformation concerning the Islands, including the report of the Queen ofBermuda&apos;s activities in 1940.8. Question of a protest to the Argentine Government will, for the timebeing, be held in reserve until either (l) further action by the Argentine Govern-ment makes it necessary, or (ii) report of the encroachments actually found byH.M.S. Carnarvon Castle is available after her return. The possibility ofdeclaring the waters round the South Shetlands as an area dangerous to shipping,which would in itself be an expression of British sovereignty, will also beconsidered later.9. Please telegraph with the least possible delay whether you have anyobservations or suggestions to make regarding the proposed instructions to theCommanding Officer of H.M.S. Carnarvon Castle.(2)Telegram to Falkland Islands (Sir A  Cardinall) from Secretary of State,Colonies, dated January 23, 1943.(No. 6.  Most Secret.)MY telegram No. 5.It has now been decided that Carnarvon Castle should visit South Orkneys,including Laurie Island.[24956] B 2. 42. Landings should be made at Signy Island, and if possible at Coronation Island, where British marks and flags should be prominently set up anda record left of the visits.At Signy Island, fullest possible information should be collected with a viewto establishing permanent party of occupation next year.3. It is desirable that a party should land on Laurie Island, where thepossibility cannot be excluded that Argentine naval ratings who now manmeteorological station have orders to protest or even offer token resistance.The Commanding Officer of the Carnarvon Castle should be guided bydemeanour of Argentine personnel, and protest by itself should not be taken assufficient grounds for not landing. It is essential, however, that no risk whatevershould be run of an armed clash, and. if necessary, on this ground any attemptto land should be abandoned.4. Subject to this over-riding condition, landing party should be sent whowould exchange courtesies with the Argentines, take them food, and establishcordial relations. Attitude towards Argentines should be based on assumptionthat : (i) Island is British, (ii) their presence there was known and warship hasno orders to object to it, (iii) flying of Argentine flag is interpreted as merelyindicating that meteorological station is Argentine. It should not be pulleddown. The British flag should not be hoisted, and no acts performed by theCivil Magistrate to demonstrate British sovereignty. In view of possible languagedifficulties, no attempt should be made to enter into any arguments about technicalities, but any Argentine enquiries as to purpose of visit may be answered asin paragraph 6 of my telegram No. 4,. If one is available, an interpreter shouldbe included in landing party.It is most important that the landing party should not post any lettersin the Argentine post office.5. Experience when Discovery II went to Laurie Island some years agosuggests that a visit made in this spirit will probably be most welcome to theArgentine party, and the fact that a British warship has called and landed aparty without asking leave of, or even notifying the Argentine Government, wouldin itself demonstrate the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Island isBritish territory.6. If the Argentine party show a disposition to resist a landing by force,attempt to land; should be abandoned, and Commanding Officer of CarnarvonCastle should by visual signal or W.T. protest strongly against this interferencewith our sovereign rights, stating that Island is British territory, that your partyis refraining from landing because of desire to avoid shedding Argentine blood,and that a report will be made to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Report should besent immediately by signal to Admiralty, repeated to Naval Officer-in-Cha^ge,Falklands, and Naval Attache, Buenos Aires.Subject to the necessity of avoiding any armed clash, warship should thenpersistvin staying in territorial waters of Laurie Island for period over 24 hoursto assert our right to be there.
