THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 33.January 19, 1943.war CABINET.COLONIAL POLICY:  DRAFT OF JOINT  DECLARATION.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, Lord Privy Seal and Secretary of State for theColonies.THE comments of Dominion Governments on the draft considered by theWar Cabinet on the 7th January are contained in the telegrams attached to this paper.  We also attach two telegrams from the Ambassador at Washington.2. We append below the draft of the Joint Declaration, modified somewhatto meet their views.3. South Africa and New Zealand have no comments on the draft, thoughNew Zealand again raises the question of New Zealand participation at a later stage in the discussions.4. Canada, while welcoming the new draft, have a suggestion to make as tothe presentation of paragraph 3. For various reasons we do not think the exactform of words they propose is satisfactory. We have tried to meet their point bysplitting paragraph 3 into two paragraphs and slightly rewording them.5. Canada also mention their previous suggestion that the regional commissions should have the right to maintain their own technical staffs and tomake their own investigations. We have not amended the draft to meet thissuggestion as we thought this was going too much into detail.6. Australia, as we had anticipated, reiterate a policy which the cabinet have considered and on which they have reached a decision. We assume that theywill not wish to alter this decision. We have, therefore, not amended the draft to meet the Australian points.7. They are also anxious that the draft Declaration should not be presented as such to Mr. Hull but only used by Lord Halifax for guidance in his conversa-tions. This is a point which has also been made by the High Commissioners here.It seems to us that the Ambassador can hardly avoid leaving a copy of the draftwith Mr. Hull, although it would, of course, be only as a basis for discussion andnot as a final statement of our views.8. As regards the telegrams from Washington, we think that Lord Halifax&apos;main point is met by the redraft of paragraph 3 and the new paragraph 4.C. R. A.A. E.C.O..

Draft Joint Declaration as Amended to meet Views of Dominions.THE immediate object of the United Nations is to defeat the presentaggression and to render future aggression impossible. This requires for itssuccessful achievement the establishment of conditions under which security,prosperity and equal opportunity can be assured to all peoples.2. This, then, is the aim of those of the United Nations which have, owingto past events, become charged with responsibilities for the future of Colonialpeoples. But it is evident that, while some peoples are far advanced along thisroad, the development and resources of others are not yet such as to enable themto achieve security and prosperity by themselves. It is therefore the duty of&quot;Parent&quot; or &quot;Trustee&quot; States to guide and develop the social, economic andpolitical institutions of the Colonial peoples until they are able without danger to themselves and others to discharge the responsibilities of government.3. This duty of guidance must be discharged in the general interest of all nations as well as in the particular interest of the peoples of the territories concerned. In pursuance of this policy, the natural resources of colonial territories should be organised and marketed not for the promotion merely ofcommercial ends, but rather for the service of the people concerned and of theworld&apos; as a whole.4. The Atlantic Charter looks to the establishment in the future of a widerand permanent system of general security. It will be the special responsibilityof Parent (or Trustee) States to ensure the safety of Colonial peoples within this general framework.5. The Parent (or Trustee) States will remain responsible for theadministration of their territories. But the policy embodied in this Declarationcannot successfully be pursued without a large measure of co-operation between nations. We accordingly propose the establishment for certain regions, as soonas circumstances permit, of Commissions comprising both the Parent (or Trustee)States concerned in the region and other States which have a major strategicor economic interest there. The machinery of each Commission should be designedto give the people of the territories an opportunity to be associated with its work.These Commissions will provide effective machinery for consultation and collabora-tion, so that the States concerned may work together to promote the advancement of the Colonial peoples and the general welfare of mankind.APPENDIX.Replies from the Dominions.1. South Africa [High Commissioner in the United Kingdom).My dear Secretary of State, January 13, 1943.MY Prime Minister has telegraphed with reference to your telegram No. 3of the 8th January and Circular telegram D. No. 14 of the same date (referenceWK. 208/1) regarding the approach to the United States Government on thesubject of Colonial Policy.General Smuts has asked me to inform you that the proposed text, ascontained in telegram D. No. 14, seems substantially to meet the American pointof view, and that he agrees that it is not necessary to include Dominion participa-tion in express terms, since that may be considered a domestic issue of theCommonwealth.Yours sincerely,D. B. SOLE(In the absence of theHigh Commissioner).The Right Hon. C. R, Attlee, M.P.
2. New Zealand (Government).(No 11.) January 12, 1943.YOUR telegram No. 6.His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand have no further comments tooffer at this stage, but hope they will have an opportunity of participating inthe subsequent discussions that are contemplated.3. Canada (High Commissioner in Canada).(No. 82.   Most Secret.) January 12, 1943.YOUR telegram to Canadian Government No. 4 and telegram D.No. 14 forPrime Minister.1. Prime Minister thinks redraft is a great improvement on the original,and very acceptable. He and his colleagues here are grateful for the opportunityoffered them to make further comments. They have not any which they regard as of such importance as to send formally in a telegram from Government to Govern-ment, but Norman Robertson and Hume Wrong asked me to go and see themto-day to discuss informally one or two points, mainly of a drafting nature, onwhich the Canadians think that the draft might be further improved. Theyembodied these points in a note as follows :  2. Begins. The second sentence of paragraph 3 is open to objection on two grounds first, that it might still be regarded as an attempt to secure a priorcommitment from the United States for participation in the defence of theBritish Colonial Empire, and secondly that, as now phrased, it mixes up state-ments applicable to all peoples and statements applicable only to Colonial peoples.These points might be met by altering the sentence along the following lines : &quot; inaccordance with the sixth article of the Atlantic Charter it is the clear responsi-bility of all the United Nations to enter into general arrangements designed tosecure the safety and prosperity of all peoples. It is the special responsibilityof &apos; parent or trustee States &apos; to ensure that the safety and prosperity of Colonialpeople are safeguarded.&quot; There should be avoided, in our view, a directreference to &quot;general defence schemes.&quot; between Colonial Powers. The draftalso implies that Colonial Powers possess responsibility for the security of allpeoples, whereas under the Atlantic Charter that responsibility is shared by allthe adherents of the Atlantic Charter.  Ends.3. Apart from the objection on two grounds which leads to these suggestedamendments, the Canadians still feel that there would be great value in introducing a specific mention of the Atlantic Charter, so as to meet the misunder-standing in America to the effect that Britain does not mean the Atlantic charter to cover Colonial peoples.4. Your telegram No. 4 says that the only point which the new draft hasnot substantially met in the Canadian suggestions is that concerning representa-tion of the third party opinion on the regional commissions. Mr. Robertson andMr. Wrong wished me to point out that the suggestion made in the last sentence of paragraph 7 of the Canadian telegram No. 274 of 23rd December, that the regional commissions should have the right to maintain their own technical staffs and to make their own investigations, has not been incorporated in the draft declaration.4. Australia (Government).(No. 14.) January 11, 1943.ADDRESSED to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs No. 14. Repeated,to Prime Minister of New Zealand No. 8, Prime Minister of Canada No. 2, PrimeMinister of Union of South Africa No. 9 and Australian Legation at WashingtonNo. 5.Your telegram No. 4 and D No. 14.   Colonies.1. We have noted the terms of the revised draft text in your telegram DNo. 14. Although the text is in the form of a draft declaration we assume thatit is not intended that Halifax should present it to Hull as such, but rather thatit should serve as general guidance to Halifax in his conversations.
2. In these circumstances we have no comment to make on thu draft at themoment beyond, the following, which sum up our views :  (a) Draft as it stands may be held to amount to requiring an absolute returnto status quo as regards sovereignty and administrative control andmight thus be regarded by the other Colonial Powers as guarantee against any change whatsoever. Clearly in the South-West Asia areachanges might be found to be desirable. For this reason the Common-wealth Government would like to make it clear that the draft couldnot be regarded as definite in respect of the South-East Asia region.(b) We maintain that some provision for the accountability of all trusteeStates to some international body as both practicable and essential ifthe trusteeship is to be a reality. Our feeling is that the generaldeclaration to the world of mere acceptance of the principle of trustee-ship will not be regarded as sufficient to establish responsibility. Wethink it of the first importance to devise principle of accountability inregard to obligations and at the least, in default of some general international body, we desire to see this included, as one of thefunctions of the proposed regional commissions. Views of theCanadian Government (corrupt group ? implicitly) support us in thisconviction, and carried to a logical conclusion it is implicit in your own draft declaration.Telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington.(1)(No. 221.) Washington, January 12, 1943YOUR telegrams Nos. 186 and 187.1 am very grateful for opportunity of seeing your revised draft and realise that you are awaiting comments from Dominions.2. While you are still at drafting stage, you will perhaps allow me to oilersome comments, without desiring to press on you the particular form of words which I had suggested.3. In the second paragraph would it not be better to begin &quot; This inparticular must be the aim, &amp;c.&quot; 1 As a statement of fact, your draft might wellbe questioned, at all events as regards some Colonial Powers.4. I feel most difficulty about paragraph 3 of your telegram 187 of whichthe sequence of thought does not strike me as completely logical and which seemsto place chief emphasis on defence schemes, and to leave &quot; the duty of guidance &quot;a bit in the air. American opinion, while not overlooking necessity of security,will prefer to lay stress on the need for improvement of political and socialstatus as an essential element in security. I suggest that it would be preferable to say that it would be the duty of Parent States to enter into schemes directed,to that end. within the general framework of (corrupt group ? world) schemesfor security.(2)(No. 222.) W ashington, January 12, 1943.MY telegram No. 221.Australian Minister showed me to-day telegrams he had received fromCanberra repeating telegrams to Dominions Minister on subject of Colonialdeclaration. In covering telegram he was instructed to place myself and Hullin possession of Australian Government&apos;s views2. I advised him not to speak to Hull at present and to tell his Govern-ment that he was not doing so pending further instructions, basing himself onfact that I was not at this stage giving Hull your views and that we had all betterwait till your consultations with Dominions were completed.   He agreed.3. You will no doubt realise importance of great discretion if you makeany reference to this, in communication to Australian Government and could perhaps keep Australian Minister out of it. I fancy his relations with hisGovernment are not too easy.
