I attach a similar survey for 1943.S.Ministry of Economic Warfare,February 5, 1943.ECONOMIC WAR IN 1943.Summary.THE events of 1942 have opened up new possibilities of attacking theenemy&apos;s war potential and have increased the strategic importance of such attacks.(1) The occupation of French North Africa will cut off Germany and italy from all supplies outside Europe and Turkey; lessen the amount of food-stuffswhich Germany can safely take from France; expose Italy&apos;s economy to more intensive attack; create indirectly a drain on Germany for the defence of Italy,which, if it affects German A.A. defences and fighter strength, will facilitateattacks upon German industry; make enemy merchant shipping in theMediterranean far more vulnerable; and indirectly threaten Germany&apos;s economic resources in the Balkans.(2) Germany and Japan have succeeded in making direct contact with one another by shipments to and from Bordeaux. About 70,000 tons of essential rawmaterials have reached Germany from Japanese-controlled Asia during the year;machinery and other products, less in weight, but probably greater in value, havereached - Japan from Germany. Projected exchanges in 1943 will certainly involve a greater number of voyages in each direction than in 1942.(3) In 1942 Germany occupied in Russia grain- and oil-producing areas ofgreat potential importance. But she had no opportunity of exploiting them, andthey are now in jeopardy.(4) The German war potential is declining. If the military pressure on heris maintained, her economic limitations must increasingly affect her strategy.(5) The German military threat to all adjacent neutrals has been further reduced by events in Russia and North Africa. The relative influence of the twobelligerent sides over these neutrals is slowly changing. At the same time their importance to Germany is increasing.[24986] b
(6) Italy, Hungary and Rpumania are in a better position to restrict their economic contributions to Germany and to increase their economic demands on her.They are showing increasing will and power to do so.(7) Japan&apos;s merchant shipping is being reduced. The rate of sinking, ifmaintained, will soon begin to curtail her industrial effort, or her operations, or both. Tanker shortage is likely to restrict her oil supplies. Her capacity for expanding her war potential will be limited by these factors and by the extent towhich she succeeds in importing from Europe.Conclusions.The principal economic objectives of our strategy in 1943 should be :  In the West (1) to press the air attack on Germany&apos;s industry and transport;(2) to attack Italy&apos;s war potential in order both to assist in destroying herresistance and to create an economic and military drain on Germany,which in turn may facilitate the attack on economic objectives there;(3) to cut Germany&apos;s sea communications with the Far East;(4) to harass Germany&apos;s sea communications around the coasts of Europe;(5) to develop in occupied countries, and especially in France, by all meansshort of inciting them to premature revolt, resistance to Germanexploitation and control;(6) to develop our influence over neutral countries so as to deny their resources to the enemy and secure them for ourselves;(7) to increase the economic demands on Germany of her European allies.In the East (8) to cut Japairs sea communications with Europe and to hamper hercommunications with the territories she has occupied; in particular to destroy her merchant shipping, especially tankers.ECONOMIC WAR IN 1943.1. The events of 1942 have opened up new possibilities of attacking theenemy&apos;s war potential, and have increased the strategic importance of such attacks.THE WEST.I. The Occupation of North Africa.2. The occupation of Morocco and Algeria has cut Germany and Italyoff from all supplies outside Europe and Turkey except such as are run through theblockade or smuggled through the remaining neutrals. It has deprived france of her African supplies, and lessened the quantity of food-stuffs which germany is likely to get from France.3. As the United Nations increase their control of the North african coast they will be able to intensify their attacks on enemy merchant shipping in the Mediterranean. If they can render the Central Mediterranean impassablebefore the enemy has transferred to the East the bulk of the ships acquired byhim in French ports their value will be largely lost to him. Few of these ships are required in the Western Mediterranean but at least a large part of the mare of great actual or potential value to him in the Eastern Mediterranean. Ifhe should secure the opportunity to develop sea transport in the Black Sea allthese ships will be urgently needed by him.4.   The complete expulsion of Axis forces from North Africa (1) Will enable the United Nations to intensify attacks on Italy&apos;s economyfrom the air, and in some places from the sea and by combined operations. Italian industry and transport is relatively weak andvulnerable, and some of its more important targets are on or withineasy reach of the coast.
(2) Will enable the United Nations to create indirectly an even moreimportant economic strain on Germany, by compelling&apos; Germany to release to Italy raw materials and munitions, to return Italianworkers and. to immobilise supplies of war materials, especially oil,for the defence of Italy.(3) If it is possible to make Germany divide her fighter strength, will pre-sumably advance the date when it will be practicable to develop a sustained air attack on Germany by day.(4) May even enable the United Nations to threaten the Balkans, from whichthe enemy draws important supplies of raw materials, especiallycopper and chrome; and may advance the time when they can mountan effective attack on the oil supplies of Roumania (without which germany could not carry on the war, except defensively within-greatly reduced frontiers) and on the rail and river transport system whichlinks Germany with Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey and Roumania.(5) Should increase the influence of the United Nations over the neutrals,especially Spain, Portugal and Turkey.II. The Neutrals.5. The defeat of German forces in Russia and Africa, the removal of the threat to Egypt and the strengthening of the Allied position in the Mediterraneanmust make the neutrals more than ever doubtful of the possibility of a Germanvictory. If Germany is unable or unwilling to act offensively to reverse theposition, especially if she does not bring effective military pressure to bear onSpain, the potential threat under which these neutrals have hitherto lived, will besensibly lessened. Moreover, the United Nations, when they control the suppliesof French North Africa and open up the Mediterranean sea route, may be ableto increase their economic influence over Spain, Portugal and Turkey.6. The improved prospects of the United Nations have not so far induced the Governments of the European neutrals and Turkey to show much sign of achange of attitude in our favour. On the other hand, in Spain and. Portugal,where we had most leeway to make up, there has been a distinct improvementin their day-to-day economic dealings with us. In 1943, we should be able toimprove our position, provided that the military situation remains favourable andthat we make full use of our ability to offer or withhold supplies. Such a resultwill be increasingly valuable, since the potential contribution of the neutrals toGermany&apos;s war effort becomes relatively more important as her own productivepower and stocks decrease.III. Control of Neutral Shipping.7. A little over a year ago Germany could still obtain mica, platinum andindustrial diamonds by air from South America, while occasional consignments of diamonds from the Belgian Congo were probably smuggled on the caravanroutes across the West African desert. Now that the legislation Air Line is closed down, and French North Africa is in Allied occupation, these German require-ments can only be met by smuggling on neutral ships. This traffic is steadily onthe increase, and cannot be satisfactorily controlled by the navicert system. Theonly effective deterrent lies in considerably increasing the number of interceptionsand searches, for which a contraband control base with facilities for unloadinglarge ships is essential.   Such facilities do not exist at Gibraltar.IV. Germany&apos;s Weaker Allies.8. The changes of the year have had an effect not only on Italy, but also onthe other Axis Allies in Europe. Hungary and Roumania have shown a slighttendency to restrict their economic contribution to Germany. All Germany&apos;sEuropean Allies may be expected to do so, and also to increase their demands ontheir senior partner, as their strategic importance becomes more manifest and as germany&apos;s prestige declines.V. Blockade Running between Europe and the Far East.9.   During  1942 Germany imported through  the blockade 10 cargoes,containing about 70,000 tons of essential raw materials and consisting mainly of rubber and edible oil.   Japan has imported 8 cargoes of about 35,000 tons,[24986] b 2
including valuable shipments of industrial plant and engineering components.So far as is known, all this traffic entered and left German Europe at Bordeaux.Despite frequent sightings, none of the efforts to attack it were successful untilNovember. Since then five out of six outward-bound voyages have been interrupted, three of the ships concerned being sunk, one turned back, and oneforced into a Spanish port with serious damage; two inward-bound vessels havebeen sunk.10. Orders continue to be exchanged for very large shipments in both directions. The expansion of Japanese steel production, which is the principallimitation on her armament and shipbuilding industries, and the maintenance ofGermany&apos;s fat ration, which is the weakest element in her food situation, bothdepend on the maintenance of the traffic; projected sailings in each direction in1943 will certainly be at a higher rate than in 1942. The extent to which thesesailings take place may well materially affect the length of the war.VI.-The Russian Campaign.11. In 1942 Germany conquered the Kuban, an important agricultural areamore fertile even than the Ukraine, but she did not have the opportunity to exploit it, and probably was not able to transport whatever proportion of itsharvest she may have won. She captured the Maikop oilfield, with its potentialproduction of 2J million tons a year, but could not disentangle it from the battlefield or take its port of Tuapse or secure its sea communications.12. Meanwhile the exploitation of her 1941 conquests has been handicapped by the prior demands of war, especially by the shortage of oil and labour, thelatter created not only by Russian evacuation, but also by forced immigration into Germany, to meet Germ any&apos;s own need for agricultural labour.VII. Economic Limitations on German Strategy.13. In 1942 Germany&apos;s lack of oil and need for oil undoubtedly played apart both in limiting the German offensive to the Southern part of the russian front and in causing it to swing South into the Caucasus when it crossed the don, in addition to driving Eastwards to Stalingrad. No doubt it contributedalso to the fact that neither drive wholly attained its object, and, indirectly, tothe German defeat in Africa. Thus in 1942 economic facts not only influencedbut also limited German strategy and affected the result of German operations.14. In 1943 Germany&apos;s economic limitations should play an even greaterpart. Her war potential has declined during 1942, and, failing some fundamental change in the military situation, must continue to decline during 1943.15. Since the Spring of 1942 an addition of 750,000 men and women fromoccupied countries to Germany&apos;s labour force only just balanced the comb-out and call-ups to the armed forces, whilst dilution and fatigue decreased the effective-ness of labour. In the whole of 1943 the maximum contribution from the occupied countries is not expected to exceed a further 750,000. If casualties continueto be heavy and the consumption of munitions severe, it will not be possiblefor Germany to maintain her armed forces at their present numbers, whilst the efficiency of her labour force must fall through the introduction of workersever less willing, skilled and fit. Air attack and transport difficulties willcontinue to reduce the productivity of labour. Her war potential will be furtheraffected, by the inadequacy of raw material supplies (accentuated by exhaustion of stocks) unless she is allowed to recoup herself by blockade-running from theFar East and by the exploitation of Russia. The deterioration of capital equip-ment is likely to be a contributory feature of increasing importance.16. Whether Germany&apos;s reduced war potential wall be unequal to the tasks which face it in 1943 will depend entirely on what those tasks are, which againwill depend largely on the scale of the offensive developed by the United Nations.VIII. Objectives in the West. ,17. To make the German war machine unequal to the situation involves bothincreasing its tasks and striking with every available weapon at the economic
bases of its strength. The latter calls for action in 1943 against the followingobjectives :- A gainst Germany.18. The air attack on Germany should be maintained at the highest possible level. It has already had substantial results in reducing the output ofwar materials, especially coal and iron in the Ruhr, impeding transport, divertinglabour to rebuilding and the production of consumer goods and, most of all, byimpairing productivity through disorganising urban life. In addition, suchheavy attacks on precise targets in occupied countries as have been possible haveshown how great and how sudden may be the effect of such attacks on the outputof specific products. The combination of area and precision bombing on a greaterscale may be expected, if scientifically directed, to show a more than proportionate increase in result, provided that the demands of the armed forces continue to be asurgent as in the past. Any weakening of resistance, either through dissipationor through saturation, will increase the return.A gainst Italy:19. Italy&apos;s economy should be attacked with all arms : by air, from the sea,and, if possible, on land. In addition, political warfare should be emplyed to increase Italy&apos;s economic demands on Germany, especially for air defence.A gainst Communications with the Far East.20. The blockade-running traffic which still connects Germany and the far east must be destroyed.Against German Europe&apos;s Land and Sea Communications.21. Communication between the different parts of Europe is essential toGermany.   The following are important and vulnerable links : (i) Germany&apos;s internal transport system is essential to her war effort. Itis less equal to its task than ever before; it will become even lessadequate to the tasks of 1943 if Germany is forced to maintain effortat widely separated points in the territories she has overrun. Herprogramme to reinforce it can be defeated only by continued attack,(ii) The traffic between Scandinavia and Germany brings vital supplies of iron-ore, timber and pulp, and supports the enemy&apos;s troops in norway and to some extent in Finland. Sinkings, coupled with the dearthof diesel oil which has immobilised 20 per cent, of his best tonnage,have already created an operational shortage of shipping in northern waters and curtailed exports of iron-ore, whilst his dependence onSwedish shipping has increased.   This situation should be exploited.(iii) The enemy is busily engaged in moving Eastward part of his concen-tration of shipping from the W. Mediterranean. If this movementcan be prevented, his operations in the Eastern Mediterranean andthe Black Sea may be permanently and progressively hampered.(iv) A dangerous traffic in iron-ore persists from Bilbao to Bayonne andBordeaux. It has been reduced slightly through the transfer of ships to Northern Waters. It remains a target for attack the moreimportant since Germany lost the iron-ore of French North Africa.In Occupied Countries.22. The importance to Germany of the occupied countries, particularlyFrance, has been intensified during 1942. Every effort (short of provoking themto premature revolt) should be made to reduce the contribution which Germanydraws from them in industrial capacity, raw materials or food, to increase theburden of administering them, to reduce the flow of their labour to Germany,and to ensure that such workers as are forced to go are a burden and a danger to their masters.In Neutral Countries.23. Every effort should be made to develop the influence of the united nations over the remaining neutrals. The possibility should be greater in 1943,and the effect of denying their resources to Germany should also be more decisive!This may be done both by agreement with the Governments concerned and by pressure on individual firms.
24. Smuggling through these countries may be expected to increase andrequires intensified control. A suitable base for examining neutral ships isnecessary for this purpose.In Satellite Countries.25. Every effort should be made to encourage Hungary, Roumania and finland, as well as Italy, to increase their economic demands on Germany and to conserve their economic resources for their own use.THE FAR EAST.26. Japan&apos;s conquests in 1942 have given her access to all the raw materialsshe needs, with the principal exceptions of wool, cotton, copper, mercury, salt andpotash. Damage to plant and equipment will probably prevent her from obtainingany lead or zinc production in 1943, and has hampered the redevelopment of heroil resources. Her most serious limitations are industrial capacity and merchantshipping, especially tankers.   -27. Japan&quot;s industrial capacity increased in 1942, and is expected to increasefurther, but it will be limited by her difficulty in expanding her present iron andsteel output (which is estimated at 9^ million tons), especially if she is prevented from importing from Europe specialised machinery and machine tools which sheneeds for producing both steel and finished armaments.28. Japaifs oil consumption is estimated at 7 million tons a year, of which about 65 per cent, represents consumption by the armed forces, particularly theNavy. Seventy-five per cent of all her consumption is in the form of diesel and fuel oil. Only 20 per cent, of her supplies comes from indigenous sources, and she is believed not yet to have secured from sources in her occupied territoriesenough to check the drain on her stocks, which are seriously depleted. Even when she secures enough crude oil, shortage of tankers will, it is estimated, limit heruse of it, especially until she has re-established refineries in occupied countries.Thus, oil shortage may be a limiting factor in 1943.29. Japaifs merchant shipping losses exceeded new construction in 1942. Ifthey continue to do so at the current rate, her merchant shipping is expected by mid-1943 to become inadequate for her military and civilian requirements on thepresent scale, thus forcing her to reduce military activity or her industrial war effort.30. Japan cannot take the place of the world markets in which the occupied territories previously sold or supply them with the consumer goods, especiallycotton goods, which they require. She plans to make each of her occupied territories self-sufficient, which will entail a radical change in their economic life;and in some of them she has already enforced a devaluation of currency. these factors will affect the standard of living and the co-operation of native populations.Objectives in the Far East.31. (i) Japan&apos;s war potential can best be weakened at sea, objectives beingblockade runners, tankers and merchant shipping. It would be of the gratest value to harass communications, particularly for tankers, between Japan and the occupied countries.(ii) Oil refining capacity in the East Indies is an objective of greatimportance.(iii) No opportunity should be missed to encourage the migration, diversionor withholding of labour needed by Japan to develop her resources, especially oil,in occupied territories.S.January 31, 1943.
