/DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET. Copy No.   28W.R. (43) 18.January 12, 1943.WAR CABINET.PROMISES ABOUT POST-WAR CONDITIONS.Note by the Prime Minister.A dangerous optimism is growing up about the conditions it will be possibleto establish here after the war. Unemployment and low wages are to be abolished ;Education greatly improved and prolonged ; great developments in Housing and health will be undertaken; Agriculture is to be maintained at least at its newhigh level. At the same time, the Cost of Living is not to be raised. the beveridge Plan of Social Insurance, or something like it, is to abolish want. Themoney which the wage-earning classes have saved during the war in nest-eggs,or accumulated by War Savings Certificates, must not lose its value.2. Our Foreign Investments have almost disappeared. The United states will be a strong competitor with British shipping. We shall have great difficulties in placing our necessary exports profitably. Meanwhile, in order tohelp Europe, we are to subject ourselves to a prolonged period of rationing anddistribute a large part of our existing stocks. We are to develop the tropicalColonies and raise the condition of their inhabitants. We must clearly keep alarge Air Force and Navy so as not to be set upon again by the Germans, and large Military forces will be needed to garrison the enemy countries and make sure they do not begin again to re-arm for revenge.3. The question steals across the mind whether we are not committing our45 million people to tasks beyond their compass, and laying on them burdensbeyond their capacity to bear. While not disheartening our people by dwellingon the dark side of things, Ministers should, in my view, be careful not to raisefalse hopes as was done last time by speeches about &quot; Homes for Heroes,&quot; &amp;c.The broad masses of the people face the hardships of life undaunted, but theyare liable to get very angry if they feel they have been gulled or cheated.   If, for -1893
instance, we raise the Old Age Tensions to  2 and other Insurance Benefitsproportionately and then, owing to a decline in the purchasing power of money,they find that the  2 buys no more than the 10s. formerly did, or that theirnest-egg or War Savings Certificates only in fact yield a quarter of thetsweat and effort which their accumulation entailed, they will feel a, sense of grievance quite different from the pangs endured by mankind in its inevitable struggle forexistence. It is for this reason of not wishing to deceive the people by false hopesand airy visions of Utopia and Eldorado that I have refrained so far from making promises about the future.4. We must all do our best, and we shall do it much better if we are nothampered by a cloud of pledges and promises which arise out of the hopeful ando-enial side of man&apos;s nature and are not brought into relation with the hard facts of life.w. s. c.]0 Downing Street, S.W. 1.
