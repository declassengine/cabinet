NAVAL  SITUATION.General Review.I. A convoy from the United Kingdom has arrived in North Russian ports.Enemy warships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept it.H.M. Submarines, one of which was lost, have continued their attacks on theenemy&apos;s supply routes to North Africa.A German blockade runner has been sunk in the S.W. Approaches.Air attacks have caused casualties among shipping at Bone. Shipping lossescaused by U-boats have been light.Home and Northern Waters.2. On the morning of the 31st December H.M. Destroyer Onflow with fourother destroyers, which were escorting a convoy to North Russia, engaged anenemy force of one cruiser and three destroyers 200 miles north of VarangerFiord. During the ensuing action ELM. Destroyer Achates was sunk and H.M.Destroyer Onsloiv was damaged, but in order to avoid repeated torpedo attacks,the enemy was compelled to retire under cover of smoke away from the convoyand towards the covering force consisting of H.M. Cruisers Sheffield andJamaica and two destroyers. This force shortly afterwards engaged an enemyship, probably the pocket battleship Lutzotu, which was hit and forced to retire.Later they engaged a destroyer which was left in a sinking condition, and forceda cruiser, either nurnberg or Hipper, to retire at high speed to the south-westward. When it was established that the enemy had withdrawn our covering-force returned.to protect the convoy. Twelve of the 14 ships in the convoy arrivedsafely on the 6th. Two ships with H.M. Minesweeper Bramble, which had partedcompany with the convoy on the 29th. are as yet unaccounted for.Seventy-eight ratings and an unknown number of officers were rescued fromAchates. Our cruisers suffered minor damage, and Ohslow, in which there were41 casualties, reached harbour on the 1st.3. A homeward-bound convoy from North Russia has reached Home Waters.Strong cover was provided by H.M. ships. This convoy was not sighted by theenemy.4. On the 1st January H.M. Cruiser Scylla was directed to a position N.W.of Cape Finisterre by a Sunderland aircraft of Coastal Command. As a resultshe intercepted and sank the German blockade runner Rhakotis (6,753 tons),bound for Bordeaux from the Far East with a cargo mainly composed ofvegetable oil.5. On the night of the 5th/6th E-boats which attempted to attack a coastalconvoy in the Channel Avere engaged and driven off by the Norwegian DestroyerGlaisdale.Mediterranean.6. The following attacks have been reported by H.M. Submarines : Taku,on patrol in the ^aegean. between the 14th and 23rd December sank a 5,000-ton ship and a caique, and shelled shipping in a harbour in Eastern Greece. P. 42sank a 5,000-ton ship off Naples on the 26th. P.211 sank a small schooner ladeirwith petrol on the 27th and two days later torpedoed a 1,500-ton northbound ship off the east coast of Tunisia. Turbulent sank a ship off Naples on the 29th.P. 45 sank two small ships off the east coast of Tunisia on the 3rd January.7. A convoy of a tanker and one other ship escorted by destroyers arrivedat Malta from Alexandria on the 2nd.8. The enemy made several heavy air attacks on shipping in Bone on the1st and 2nd, in the course of which H.M. Cruiser A)ax, and HM. MinesweeperAlarm, were damaged.9. Naval Albacores attacked two escorted ships N.W. of Marsala on the31st and damaged one.10.   H.M. Submarine P. 48 has not replied to signals and must be presumed lost.South-West Pacific.II. CJ.S. M.T.Bs. attacked eight Japanese destroyers in isolated,engagements off the north-west of Guadalcanal, and torpedoed one and possiblytwo others.US. aircraft sank two Japanese destroyers and seriously damaged another,details are given under the Air Situation.
Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Fourteen attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week, 12by aircraft and two by surface craft. Six were carried out in the Bay of Biscayand four in the West Indies.Two attacks by Wellingtons in the Bay of Biscay, one by a Liberator (B. 24)off Land&apos;s End and another by a Catalina (PBY. 5) near Freetown were consideredpromising.Enemy Intelligence.German.13. The scharnhorst and Tirpitz are reported fit for service and the latter is expected to sail from Trondheim shortly. The aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelinis not expected to be in service for at least four months.Italian.14. Of the proposed construction programme of 12 Regolo class cruisers,only five have been undertaken. One is completed, three are nearing completionand one is being converted to an aircraft carrier.A new type of escort vessel resembling the Orsa class torpedo boat has been developed; of 36 laid clown, two are finished, 13 are fitting out and 21 are onthe slips.Of the 35 effective fleet destroyers, 12 are repairing, 18 are employed onNorth African convoys, leaving only five available for fleet purposes.U-boats.15. Moderate activity continues off the N.E. coast of Brazil and in theNorth Atlantic, where the number operating remains much the same.The successful passage of the convoys to and from North Russia makes itapparent that the enemy had no concentration in Northern Waters.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 3rd/4th, 694 ships have been convoyed.Of these 196 were in ocean convoys and 498 in British coastal convoys.One auxiliary aircraft carrier. 56 destroyers (including six U.S. destroyers)and 63 cutters and corvettes (including two U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.17. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 2nd totalled 351,000 tons compared with 801,000 tons during theprevious seven days, and an average of 448,800 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports 177,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. Two ships were sunk by U-boats, one off the north coast of Brazil, theother a tanker in an eastbound convoy in mid-Atlantic. Two ships, one a ladentanker, were lost and five damaged during several air attacks at Bone on the 1stand 2nd. One ship blew up off Oran from an unknown cause, another was mined and sunk at the southern entrance to the Irish Sea.British Minelaying.19. Surface craft laJd mines off the East Coast and in the Red Sea.Aircraft laid mines in the Bay of Biscay and off Crete.Enemy Minelaying and Allied Minesweeping.20. minelaying by enemy aircraft off the East and North-east coasts was suspected on two nights of the week.E-boats may have laid mines on the East and South coasts on the 5th and 6th.Many drifting mines have been washed ashore on the west coast of England.Mine totals are: magnetic, 2,751; acoustic, 1,326; moored, 2,034.21. A US. summary of enemy mining states that five magnetic mines were destroyed in the Ambrose Channel off New York in November. Mine totals forall ports swept by U.S. Minesweeping Forces up to the 1st December, 1942,were : magnetic, 35; acoustic, 2.[24877] b
Enemy Merchant Shipping.22. The Roumanian s.s. Alba Julia (5.701 tons) sailed from Istanbul on the30th December for Trieste via Salonika. The Italian tanker AIbaro (2,104 tons)is reported, to have arrived at Istanbul from the Piraeus on the 1st January.vichy Merchant Shipping.23. It is reported that the transference of 146 Vichy ships to the Axis isnow contemplated. It is estimated that 66 of these ships, totalling 210,500 tons,had reached ports in Italy by the 26th December. These 66 ships consisted of18 ex-Allied and Danish ships totalling approximately 80,000 tons, 21 identifiedVichy ships of 60.500 tons and 27 unidentified Vichy ships totalling some70,000 tons.German seamen are reported to have reached Marseilles and to have takensome of the ships out on their voyage to Italy. Norwegian seamen are also reported to be going to the south of France.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-Gernian Campaign.Central Sector.24. On New Year&apos;s Day the Russians announced the capture of VelikieLuki. The Germans have since persistently disputed this claim and, while thesituation is very obscure, it seems possible that the town has fallen, but thatfighting continues in the vicinity. Velikie Luki is the site of one of the principalpre-war civilian airfields in Western TJ.S.S.R. With Velikie Luki firmly in their hands, the Russians threaten the junctions of Novo Sokoiniki and Nevel, on themain lateral railway from Leningrad to the South.Middle Don Sector..25. Supply difficulties, coupled with stiffened German resistance^ had haltedthe general Russian advance in this sector. It is even probable that the Germansregained some of the ground that earlier they had. lost, though their counter-attacks cannot be described as a major counter-thrust. Latterly, however, theRussians have been able to renew their pressure S.W. of the River Chir and,advancing astride the railway running westward from Stalingrad to Likhaya,have captured Morozovskaya.Stalingrad Sector.26. East of the Don Bend the encircled German Sixth Army still holds out.though its supplies are reported to be running very low.Lower Don and Kalmulc Sectors.27. Continuing their rapid thrust south-westwards clown the railwayStalingrad-Tikhoretsk, the Russians have now reached a point some 45 milesbeyond Kotelnikov. At the same time, boldly following up the German retreat,the Russians have struck on their right flank W.S.W. astride the Lower Don.taking Tsimlyanskaya and. on their left flank, westward across the KalmukSteppe, where the chief town Elista has been captured.Caucasus Sector.28. In the area of the River Terek the Russians have occupied Mozdok,Nalchik and. more important, Prokhladnenski, the junction through which theGermans had supplied the Terek Sector. All three places seem to have been evacuated under little pressure, and the Germans appear to be withdrawingdeliberately. It is a matter for conjecture, however, whether their withdrawalhas been forced by a local Russian threat or been prompted by anxiety for the safety of the German lines of communication through Rostov.
Summary.29. In the Middle and Lower Don Sectors the Russians are still beinghampered by a lack of communications. They remain in only incomplete controlof the railway Svoboda-Millerovo, while the continued presence of the GermanSixth Army east of the Don Bend prevents their use of the two railways runningwestward and south-westward from Stalingrad. The Germans, on the otherhand, command a fair system of railways running from the Ukraine into the don Bend, and the failure of the Germans so far to launch a major counter-thrust in the latter area is, therefore, surprising. On the railway S.W. of stalingrad the German defeat has been so decisive that an early renewal ofthe German offensive effort there appears to be most unlikely. Harassed by theRussians and as a result of the threat to their main lines of communications, thewithdrawal of the German forces from the Terek Sector of Caucasia may wellcontinue as a precautionary measure in order to make a total withdrawal throughBostov possible should this become inevitable.Tunisia.30. During the past week there have been signs of some improvement in the weather, particularly in Central and Southern Tunisia, but even so activity on both sides has been confined mainly to patrolling along the whole front.In the North, on the 5th, British units with air support captured severalpositions from the enemy on the high ground 15 miles west of Mateur. Initialenemy counter-attacks were unsuccessful, and we were able to mop up isolatedposts. * On the morning of the 6th, however, the position became untenable andour troops were forced to withdraw. Further south contact has been maintainedwith the enemy at Bou Arada by strong Allied armoured patrols; a reconnaissance in force carried out on the 2nd from a point on the roadseven miles east of Bou Arada to G rich El Oued met with the minimum of opposition.On our southern flank the French, after their successful action at DjebelFkirine on the 27th, when they captured 100 Italian prisoners, were counter-attacked on the 28th from an area south of Pont Du Fahs by a mixed Germanand Italian force supported by some German tanks; the situation in this arearemains fluid. On the 3rd January the French evacuated Fondouk after a sharpengagement with the enemy who were supported by tanks and bombers; the enemyare reported, however, in this action to have lost between. 10 and 15 tanks andhave now themselves withdrawn to positions east of Fondouk. In this area thesituation remains obscure. - -The re-grouping of our forces on the whole front continues steadily, thoughthe poor state of communications and the bad weather contrive to make this avery slow process.Libya.31.   The enemy has temporarily suspended his movement westward.By the 29th December the last elements of the enemy rearguard had completed their withdrawal into the area of their main position between Bouerat andel Ghedclahia. Their line now runs approximately south-west from a point onthe coast a few miles north of Bouerat, which the enemy has evacuated, crossesthe el Gheddahia-Bu Ngem road 15 miles south of Gheddahia and thence bendswestwards to Wadi Zemzem.Our patrols have pushed forward to the enemy positions and remain inobservation. Visibility has, however, been limited due to severe dust storms.On the 5th visibility improved, and 30 miles north of Bu Ngem our armoured carshad a brush with the enemy. There have been reports of enemy blasting, diggingand wiring in the area of Wadi Zemzem.The remainder of the Eighth Army continues its concentration in the forward area.Burma.32. In the Arakan coastal area carrier patrols have operated down the coastto Foul Point which is separated from Akyab Island by the 3-miles-wideMayu Estuary; east of the estuary, our troops are in contact with the Japanesesome 20 miles north of Akyab Island.In the Chin Hills no contact has been reported during the past week.[24877] B 2
AIR SITUATION.General Review.36.   US. heavy bombers attacked the docks at St. Nazaire.Heavy attacks were carried out on Axis ports in Tunisia. Persistent raids against our supply base at Bone were the main feature of enemy operations in africa.Allied aircraft inflicted severe ca.sualt.ies on enemy shipping at Rabaul.United Kingdom.37. Enemy activity against this country, though still on a modest scale,showed a slight increase over the previous week; 26 aircraft were plottedoverland by day, one of which crashed. By night about seven aircraft crossedour coasts for brief intervals; two of these were destroyed, the causes beingunknown.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.38. Operations were restricted by bad weather except on the 3rd, when85 US. Fortresses (B. 17) and Liberators (B. 24) were despatched against the docks at St. Xazaire. About 60 per cent, attacked, and these dropped 268 1,000-lb. H.E. bombs, but, owing to a smoke screen which partially obscured the target, few results could be observed. Fires were, however, seen in two of the docks, and other damage assessed from photographs taken later on the same day is referred to in Appendix VI. Many enemy fighters were encountered, and ofthese the bombers claim to have destroyed 38, probably destroyed 10 ami damagedfour. Seven Fortresses are missing and a Liberator crashed in this country. The19 squadrons of Spitfires acting as cover to and from the Brittany coast and ondiversionary sweeps completed their patrols uneventfully.Harassing operations by fighters resulted in the destruction of or damage to10 locomotives, and Mosquitos of Bomber Command made effective low-levelbombing attacks on railway centres at Mons. Raismes, Monceau-sur-Sambre.Amiens, Tergnier and near Lille.Night.39. Bad weather also restricted night operations, which were confined to two small attacks on Fssen and one on Dusseldorf. A total of 97 tons of H.Land incendiaries was dropped on Essen in reasonably good visibility, and aPacific Zone.New Guinea.33. Australian and American troops have overcome Japanese resistanceS.W. of Buna; only small isolated and disorganised parties of the enemy remainin the area.Allied troops are attacking Japanese positions at Sanananda, 6 miles N.W.of Buna.Timor.34. The Japanese,.now estimated to number 15,000, are continuing their efforts to overcome the resistance of Allied guerrilla troops; their columns aremoving south along the road and tracks leading inland from their positions along the north coast.Intelligence.South- West Pacific Japanese Order of Battle.35. The Japanese strength in New Guinea-New Britain-Solomons is now considered to be equivalent to three and a half to four divisions instead of five divisions, as previously estimated.   The strength is distributed as follows ;  New Guinea : 7,000, or about half a division.New Britain : 40,000, equivalent to two divisions.North-West Solomons :  10.000. equivalent to half a division.Guadalcanal : -10,000-15,000, equivalent to half to three-quarters of odivision.
number of large fires were reported. On both occasions, accurate heavy &quot;flak&quot;and intense searchlight activity were encountered. At dusseldorf, thick cloudprevented results being observed. From these operations six bombers failed toreturn.Intruder patrols, also on a small scale, resulted in four attacks on locomotives.Coastal Operations.40. Anti-shipping patrols resulted in few attacks, and no hits on enemy vessels are claimed.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 121 were despatched, operated on three nights and laid 293 sea-mines in enemy waters.Mediterranean.French North Africa.41. Axis ports on the north and east Tunisian coast were subjected tonumerous raids in daylight and, occasionally, by night. At Bizerta, harbour and railway facilities were severely damaged (some being rendered useless), thephosphate warehouses sustained considerable further damage and the passengerrailway station was demolished. At La. Goulette, persistently attacked by ourmedium and heavy bombers, two ships were hit, one of which probably sank.Bombs fell on the dry dock and eight electric transformers and an oil depotwere destroyed. Railway sidings at Sfax were seriously damaged; two vessels were hit in the harbour, where fires were started. It is probable that a cruiserwas also hit. The docks at Tunis and Sousse were successfully attacked; atthe latter, no movements at the Sousse end of the Sousse-Sfax railway nor atthe dockside railway appear to have taken place since the 2nd January.Good results were obtained against inland targets, including airfields andbarracks near Gabes; the airfield, railway yards and camp at Kairouan; a repairdepot S.E. of Pont du Fahs; a railway bridge south of Tunis; batteries west of Mateur and objectives at Cherichera, 83 miles S.S.W. of Tunis. offensive operations against mechanised transport resulted in the destruction of or damage to a number of vehicles in the Tebourba-Medjez el Bab-M^ssicault area andalso near Fonclouk el Aouareb.On the 2nd January, Allied aircraft had a particularly successful day,32 enemy aircraft being destroyed in combat and a further 40 probably destroyed or damaged. These casualties, inflicted for the loss of two Allied bombers and five fighters, resulted from the following operations: (1) During a bombingraid on La Goulette, out of 50 enemy aircraft encountered Fortresses (B.17)claimed 17 destroyed, 10 probably destroyed and 15 damaged. (2) In fightersweeps over forward areas, six were destroyed, two probably destroyed and eightdamaged. (3) Spitfires protecting Bone, destroyed six, probably destroyed one and damaged four.The enemy made persistent and intensive attempts to disrupt our supply position at Bone, against, which he despatched a total of over 275 aircraft, an effort which was greatly minimised by successful interception by Spitfires. Onten occasions, waves of heavy fighters, fighterrbombers or dive-bombers endeavoured to penetrate our fighter defence. Seven large-scale attacks were dispersed ordriven off before developing and, on the remaining occasions, only 50 aircraftsucceeded in getting through. Damage to shipping is reported under &quot; naval situation &quot; and, in addition, five Allied aircraft were hit on Bone airfield. NineSpitfires were lost on interception, 10 enemy aircraft were shot down and afurther 14 damaged. Machine-gun and dive-bombing attacks were made on our positions in the forward areas. Airfields at Souk-el-Arba,. Youks-les-Bains,Biskra and. Thelepte (160 miles S.W. of Tunis) were bombed, but, apart fromthe raids on Bone, offensive activity by the enemy was moderate.Southern Italy. Sicily and the Sicilian Channel.42. Incendiary bombs dropped at Taranto started fires in the navaL dock-yard.   The harbour at Brindisi was also attacked with incendiaries.Wellingtons from Malta dropped 16 tons of H.E. bombs on Palermo harbour;shipping moored at the naval jetties was.hit and two fires started in the dock area. Night &quot; intruder &quot; patrols over Sicilian airfields and daylight sweeps overSouthern Sicily were continued.Dispersed aircraft on the landing ground on Lampedusa Island were attacked by Spitfires on two occasions, and a Wellington started, three fires at Pantelleria.
Libya.43. Activity by both sides was on a reduced scale over the battle area, due torain and sand storms, and, in the main, was confined to patrols. Offensive sortiesby fighters were flown whenever possible and tactical reconnaissances and ship-ping protection patrols were maintained but, generally, operations were without incident.Ivittyhawks (P. 40) machine-gunned troops near Bir el Churgia (50 miles south of Misurata) and. attacked the landing ground there; two interceptingfighters were shot clown and another damaged for the loss of one Kittyhawk.Some enemy dive-bombing of our positions in the Bir ez Zidan area (30 miles south of Bucrat el Hsun) was carried out. Thirty aircraft made two attacks onthe site of a new Allied landing ground south of Tamet; three enemy aircraft were destroyed by ground fire.   A dawn raid on Benghazi was ineffective.Crete.44. Steadily-mounting attacks have been in progress against the chain ofairfields in Crete. These culminated, on the 2nd, in a raid by 60 U.S. bombersfrom Cyrenaiea. Bombs were dropped on Herald ion, Tymbaki and KastelliPecliada airfields and, on port installations and a, camp at Suda Bay. Low cloudprevented the observation of results apart from bomb-bursts on runways and indispersal areas. Six aircraft, which did not locate Tymbaki, bombed Kapistri,55 miles east of that place.Russia.45. There is little information of the part played by the Russian Air force during the past week.In the Stalingrad area, the Germans admitted on the 1st that, in spite ofmany attempts causing many losses, they were unable to supply the encircled6th Army. Other authentic reports show that N.W. and S.W. of Stalingrad,Russian aircraft operated clay and night against enemy troops in the Kotelnikovarea, round Elista and in the vicinity of the 6th Army.In the west Caucasus, important-tant railway junctions at Salsk, Maikop andKrapitkin were raided by the Russians.During the week ending the 2nd, the Russians claim to have destroyed 266German aircraft, of which 98 were transport aircraft in the Stalingrad area.Their losses for the same period are stated to be 122.Burma.46. Allied aircraft made numerous small-scale attacks on targets in theAkyab area and on coastal villages and small craft between Akyab and the mouth of the Irrawadcly. Further South, U.S. Liberators (B. 24) made two successfulraids on shipping at Rangoon, setting on fire a 15,000-ton transport, a 6,000-ton merchant ship and a 5,000-ton tanker.Airfields at Shwebo, Dabaing and Monywa were bombed and, at Magwe, a machine-srun attack bv Hurricanes resulted in the destruction of several enemvaircraft on the ground.In Central Burma, Allied bombers made three attacks on railway yards atMandalay and also bombed Gangaw, Kalemyo and Kanbya and railway targets at Myitnge (near Mandalay), Monywa and on the Myitkyina-Katha line.On the Burma-China frontier, U.S. aircraft operating from China bombed the barracks at Mengmao (East of Lungling).From the above operations, three aircraft are missing.Pacific Zone.ISletu Guinea.47. Allied aircraft repeatedly attacked enemy positions in the Sananandaarea and the airfield at Lae. At the latter, in addition to nine enemy fighters destroyed&apos; in combat, at least seven aircraft were destroyed on the ground andmany others were damaged; four A.A. positions wore destroyed. Other targetsattacked were Salamoa, enemy positions near Cape Ward Hunt, and the airfields at Madang and Wewak, where a bomber and several unserviceable aircraft on theground were destroyed.
A successful interception by Allied aircraft of an enemy convoy of ten shipsapproaching Lae resulted in the sinking of two transports, one being of 14,000 tonsand carrying troops, and damage to a third. In combat, 18 enemy fighters were shot down and others damaged.Enemy bombers made two attacks on Merauke causing severe damage to thetownship. An ineffective raid was made on the Government station at Tun(150 miles East of Port Moresby).Netv Britain.48. U.S. heavy bombers continue to attack successfully enemy shipping atRabaui. Nine ships, including a destroyer, were sunk and a further six ships were either set on. fire or hit. Smaller scale raids were made on the airfields at Lakunai,Vunakanau and Gasmata.Solomons.49. U.S. aircraft made two attacks on the airfield at Munda, and also bombed the Japanese headquarters on Guadalcanal.A flotilla of enemy destroyers, located 30 miles off Rendova Island in theNew Georgia Group, was attacked by U.S. dive-bombers; one destroyer was lefton fire and another appeared to be sinking.Aleutian Islands.50. On the 1st. escorted U.S. Liberators (B. 24) bombed shipping in Kiskaharbour.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.51. On five days of the week bombs were dropped at eight places on thesouth and east coasts, accompanied by scattered machine-gun fire. The damage done was not serious, but casualties included 11 killed at Kingsbridge (Devon)and 22 at Shanklin, of whom four were children in a Roman Catholic Church,where 22 children were also seriously injured. The only incidents at night causeddamage to property in the riverside area, of Hull.Casualties.52. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours on the6th were 53 killed, 83 seriously injured, 2 missing.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form.
