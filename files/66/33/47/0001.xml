Eighty-eight mines were laid between the 1st and3rd January.The following table shows the known effects of the Bomber Command miningcampaign against Axis shipping during the past six months. It can safely beassumed that the.full results achieved were substantially larger, since many losses from this cause necessarily remain unknown to us : [24975] b

Considerable damage is revealed, though there are no large areas of destruction in the part of the towncovered. Factories affected include a number engaged on war production, and inthe small part of the inland docks photographed considerable damage towarehouses and stores on the quay-side can be seen. Many public and commercialbuildings have suffered, including the Bourse, main Post Office. Law Courts andAdministrative Offices.Munich. .On the 21st/22nd December 137 aircraft (128 heavies) were despatched toMunich, the first attack on this objective since the 19th September. Weatheiconditions en route were excellent, but 10/10th cloud at 4,000 feet was found overthe target itself. Aircraft of the Pathfinder Force, however, kept a large lake20 miles from Munich well illuminated, and a high proportion of the attackingcrews are confident that they bombed with success. Photographic cover is notyet available.Information regarding Previous Raids.Turin.The C.I.U. Damage Plot of Turin attached, including damage done in themost recent attacks, shows that the city has sustained heavy and extensive damage.So far 933 aircraft have been despatched to this target. Over 800 report havingattacked it and 10 of the total are missing.The following is a summary of the damage established by photographs as having occurred in the raids of the 28th/29th November, 29th/30th November,8th/9th December and 9th/10th December : &apos;At least 70 industrial plants, factories, small industries and workshopshave been damaged. Several of the factories have been completely gutted andmany others so seriously damaged that they appear to be out of commission.Industrial damage is proportionately far greater than that done to business and residential property.Works engaged on the manufacture of armaments have suffered especiallybadly. No less than ten of the Fiat plants have been affected. These producerailway rolling-stock, lorries, A.F.Vs., aero-engines and airframes, tank engines and marine engines. Metal smelting works, steel works, foundries, timber works,machine shops and two of the Lancia plants, one believed to &quot;produce militaryvehicles, have been hit.
Damage to military property includes the destruction of about one acre ofthe State Arsenal as well as substantial damage to the Royal Arsenal andBarracks.Although many of the factories have been gutted or have had their roofsburnt off, a very large amount of destruction in these four raids is due to H.E.Detailed assessment of blast damage is not yet possible but it is probably very heavy. Areas and incidents of &quot;damaged and destruction are seen to cover some250 acres.Amongst a long list of factories and workshops more or less heavily damaged are Stabilimento San Giorgio and Officine Viberti (Aircraftcomponents), Fabrica Italiana Bliche per Aviazione (propellors), S.I.C.M.A.T.(machine tools), Elli, Aerboni &amp; Co. (tools for machine and naval industries).The State Railways workshops were very severely damaged, as were the Fiatrailway workshops.Krefeld.Assessment oh damage from photographs taken on the 28th December, 1942,is hampered by a light fall of snow. The photographs show, however, that theraids on the 22nd and 23rd October caused severe damage. The most importantdamage is that to the factories in the north-west outskirts. Here a large silk-weaving mill has been severely damaged and three factories engaged in themanufacture of textile machinery have been partly destroyed. The Husarenbarracks (now used as a police barracks) received direct hits partly demolishingthree blocks of buildings. The chimney stack at the brick works has been demolished. In addition, there is considerable damage to residential property.In the centre of the town an area of six acres had been devastated possibly by asingle H.E. incident: about 20 to 30 buildings were affected, some demolishedcompletely and other damaged by blast. Other incidents include an area of3^ acres near the Adolf Hitler Strasse. Photographs Nos. I and II show some ofthe damage.dusseldorf.Further information from a reliable source on the raid of 10th/11thSeptember reveals that 400 people were killed. Water supplies were interruptedfor about three days. The general attitude of the public appears to have been one of regret that Berlin instead of the Rhineland was not selected as our objective.Bremen.The first photographic cover obtained since the raid of the 13th/14thSeptember shows that damage done then, though involving no large-scale and complete destruction, was in total very heavy.Important features are considerable devastated areas in Neustadt, damage to the Lloyd Dynamo Works, and also to the Borgward Engineering works atHastecit. A large amount of residential property, especially workers&apos; houses, inthe closely built-up suburbs, has been destroyed.Wilhelms haven.Results of the raid on the 14th/15th September have now been photographed,but industrial haze and smoke screen prevent the satisfactory assessment of damage. About six acres of total destruction, as well as isolated incidents, are seen in the residential and business areas of the town.Serious damage appears also to have been caused, to the main railway station and Bauhafen (submarine building area).Eindhoven.Small-scale photographic cover of poor quality, including only the South-Western edge of the Strijp Group of factories, and&apos; the Southern half of theEindhoven Group, reveals the following damage caused in the daylight raid ofthe 6th December : Strijp Group.^Two single-storey buildings in the Workshops have been completely destroyed and another severely damaged by fire.   In the Glass-works two buildings are very severely damaged.    One buildino- in the[24975] Bb2
Machine Shops has been completely destroyed and two sheds damaged.Amongst other industrial buildings destroyed, or damaged are the RadioAssembly Shops, a paper mill, an X-ray laboratory, and Electro-TechnicalFactory and several unidentified buildings.Eindhoven Group. The South-West wing of the lamp and valvefactory has been severely damaged, and there is serious damage in other partsof the factory. In addition, roofs of the Commercial Head Offices havebeen partially destroyed by fire and there is roof damage also to threeunidentified buildings. There is serious roof damage to the StoomlinnenTextile factory.Visible roof damage in buildings of this type is good evidence that majorinternal damage has been caused.Kassel.Two sources refer to the bombing of the Fiesler factory at Kassel-Bettenhausenin the course of the Kassel raid of&apos;the 27th/28th August. This presumably refers to the parent plant at Bettenhausen, which supplies major components to the twoassembly works at the adjoining suburb of Walclau, now believed to be engaged on the production of F.W. 190 fighters and Storch reconnaissance aircraft. these works were not covered in the reconnaissance after the raid.One source says that all work ceased for 10 days and that the management-decided not to repair those sections which had been badly hit, but to increase production elsewhere. The second source stated that the protective measures taken the vital sections had been moved underground and those in the open coveredwith bombproof roofs had minimised the effects of the bombing, and that loss ofproduction had been limited to 12 per cent, for an unspecified period.It seems reasonable to believe that some damage was clone, and as Betten-hausen is one of the most important aircraft factories in Germany, this represents a good return for the effort expended.Occupied Belgium.Liege.A reliable source reports that during the raid on the 2nd October severalbombs struck the Phoenix Works, severely damaging the rolling-mills andsurrounding workshops. This factory is known to have been producing kitchenutensils for Germany, where there is a great shortage of such articles.Occupied Holland.A reliable source reports that, up to the middle of November : (i) Hengelo. The Stork factory had been hit by 13 bombs.   Apart fromthe direct damage caused, 56,000 square metres of glass were destroyed and this by itself was sufficient to cause a severe reduction in outputon account of blackout difficulties. The power station received a hit.which resulted in destruction of the reserve capacity.(ii) Sluiskil. The coke furnaces had been badly damaged by bombs.  At thattime -work had not been resumed.Den Helder.Photograph No. 3, taken during the daylight raid on the docks on the23rd December, shows direct hits on the torpedo workshops and naval barracks.The Zee dock sluice also appears to have been hit.General.Severe blows have recently been dealt to Germany&apos;s supplies of importedores from the Mediterranean area. In addition to being denied direct importsfrom N. Africa, she has also suffered from the interruption of shipments ofcertain imported ores from Spain which, though small in quantity, are high in quality and therefore of particular importance for the production of high-gradesteel. The bombing of Genoa and Savona provided the Spaniards with an excuse for delays in the sailings of certain ships, and, before the facilities at these portshad been restored sufficiently to persuade the reluctant Spaniards to- sail, the
extension of the blockade to the western Mediterranean had made this trafficincreasingly hazardous. The Spanish railways are in no condition to handleadditional ore traffic and though some German-owned ships are still known tobe engaged in the trade, the net loss to Germany (Italy was never allowed toretain any for her own use) may be of the order of 18,000 tons a month.At the same time Germany&apos;s ore supplies from the Biscay Coast via Bilbao-Bayonne have suffered considerable interference from the mining of the latterport. Shipping delays have recently occurred on several occasions in this area;one of them caused by the sinking of a dredger and a trawler in the navigablechannel of the Adour stopped all traffic to Bayonne for eight days. Shipmentson this route during September and October are believed in consequence to havefallen by one-third.A. H. M. S.A ir Ministry,January 30, 1943.
