THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.MOST SECRET. CoPy No-W.P. (43) 15.January 8, 1943.TO BE  KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.ENEMY STRENGTH IN TUNISIA.Note by the Secretary.THE annexed Minutes on the subject of Enemy Strength in Tunisia are circulated to the War Cabinet and Defence Committee, by the direction of thePrime Minister.Signed E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,January 8. 1943.(i)General Ismay, for Chiefs of Staff Committee.It is important to make the best possible estimate of the German and Italianstrength in Tunisia as on the 1st March.2. In the two months since the landing the Axis have built up about29,000 Germans and 14,000 Italians, making a total of 43,000. Since about1,500 of these were Italians who crossed over from Tripolitania, the rate ofbuild-up does not exceed 700 a day. There are no grounds for assuming a future rate of build-up of more than a thousand a day. We may thereforeassume a maximum of 100,000 men by the 1st March. In the present 43,000are included three or four thousand air personnel and a proportion of the supplytroops of the 90th German Army Corps, together with the Staffs, flak, &amp;c. In orderto maintain four divisions of our First Army a total of 211,000 men is said to berequired. Assuming that the Germans and Italians work on a similar basis,and making some allowance for their shorter lines of communication, it is unlikely that they could form and maintain from Tunisian resources more than two or at the outside three German divisions and two weak Italian divisions,which are no stronger than brigade groups. An equivalent of four divisionsmight well be found correct.3. This force cannot have normal mobility. The 43,000 now there aredesperately short of artillery and of transport, reinforcement by air or destroyernot allowing vehicles to be brought in. A careful check must be kept of theships entering Bizerta and Tunis, about one-third of which we sink. the attempt to supply Rommel&apos;s army from Sousse, Sfax and Gabes does not seem likely to succeed in the teeth of our heavy air attack. To sum up, we mightcount on the equivalent of four divisions lightly equipped with artillery and sosupplied with transport as to be incapable of far-ranging operations.4. It seems probable that RommeFs army will try to retreat upon Tunisia,closely followed by Generals Alexander and Montgomery. It must not be taken for granted that Rommel will escape heavjr mauling in the various battles he isto fight and in the defence of Tripoli. Should we capture Tripoli at the beginningof February, he will then have to retire first to the frontier and then into Tunisia.[24884]
It is assumed too readily that this is a feasible operation, and a report on the communications should be furnished. Moreover, the route may be cut by theoperations of the Eastern Task Force, and will certainly be seriously hampered by our air attack. However, assuming that Rommel is able to make his way intoTunisia with the main part of his forces, let us see what these amount to.5. We know that the German ration strength in the middle of december was about 70,000, but the great bulk of these are air force ground personnel,supply and administrative services which have grown up in two years of thisdesert war. The strength of the German divisions, namely, the 15th and21st Panzers, the 164th Motorised and the Brigade Ramcke, is less than a third,or even a quarter, of their strength at the Battle of Alamein. It is very unlikelythat Rommel has with him at the front more than 22,000 Germans in the abovefighting formations.6. The Italians must also be considered to have about 70,000 men in tripolitania. For these, however, very little or no transport is available. Thetwo corps. 20th and 21st, which they have at the front are an encumbrance andan anxiety to Rommel and may conceivably be cut off and mopped up by ourattack. The combined strength of both Italian units at present in the line withRommel does not exceed 22,000 men. There is, of course, the accumulation of thesupply services, air groundsmen and the like strewed along the road to Tripoli,but the fighting&apos; value of these is so low as to be negligible. Even before the battle of Alamein the Italian divisions had little more than the strength which we assignto brigade groups.7. Assuming, therefore, that Rommel is . not reinforced from across theMediterranean and that he makes his way without serious mauling into Tunisiaby the 1st March, the maximum forces which, he can bring will not. exceed the equivalent of one Panzer and one motorised German divisions and two weakItalian divisions.8. It would seem safe, therefore, from all the above to conclude that the total enemy forces in Tunisia on the 1st March will not exceed 200.000 ration strength,of which 120,000 will represent the fighting strength, or : 4 or 5 German divisions.2 of which will be Panzer, and the equivalent of 2 or 3 full-strength Italiandivisions, although these may be called by higher denominations; grand total.6 or 7 divisions, the whole ill-equipped with transport and artillery.9.   Let me know vour views.(Initialled) W. S. C,January 5. 1043.(ii)Prime Mixister.With reference to your minute of the 5th January, the Chiefs of Staff hadalready instructed the Joint Intelligence Staff to prepare an appreciation ofAxis Strategy in North Africa.2. This has now been completed/&apos; The Chiefs of Staff are in generalagreement with it.3. The Chiefs of Staff find that the Intelligence Staffs estimates of Axisstrengths in North Africa, as set out in this report, correspond very closely withthe figures in your minute. They submit the following comments on points of detail : (i) Reference your Paragraph, - I. The Intelligence Staffs estimatesrelate to mid-February, whereas your estimate is for the 1st March.It is not thought, however, that this difference in dates willsubstantially alter the figures.(ii) Reference your Paragraph The Chiefs of Staff consider that yourestimate of 100,000 by the 1st March is a safe one. If anything, iimay prove to be on the high side.(iii) Reference your Paragraph 3. The Chiefs of Staff agree that we mightcount on the equivalent of four Divisions with the limitations which you set out. This force has at present an armoured strength of some210 German and Italian tanks, plus 40 Italian light tanks. this might be increased to over 300 by the 1st March.* J.I.C. (43) 3 (())-not printed.
(iv) Reference your Paragraph 4- A report on Tripoli-Tunisia communi-cations is being prepared. Your, assumption, however, that Rommelwill be able to make his way into Tunisia with the main part of his forces is a possibility which must certainly be reckoned with.(v) Reference your Paragraph 5. At the beginning of January 1943German ration strength was estimated at 68,000. Of this total thefighting formations (including anti-aircraft artillery with the army)amounted to 45,000. but with an actual fighting strength of 22,000.1This compares with the fighting formation strength of 60,000 and an actual fighting strength of 28,000 on the Alamein position. Thus, the numerical strength is roughly three-quarters of that at Alamein. Itis true to say, however, that, serviceable tanks represent a quarter andfieid, medium and anti-tank guns one-third of the figure at Alamein.The 90th Light Division should be named in company with the15th and 21st Panzer Divisions, 164th Division and Brigade Rameke(now known as Nikolai).(vi) Reference, your Paragraph 6. The Chiefs of Staff agree.(vii) Reference your Paragraph  7. To say that the German forces areequivalent to 1 Panzer and 1 motorisecl division is roughly true,-although still organised as 2 Panzer and 2 other divisions.   Further -more, Rommel has at present only some 60 German and some 30 Italianserviceable tanks in all.(viii) Reference your Paragraph 8. The Chiefs of Staff agree.(Signed) H. L. ISMAY.January 7, 1943.f &apos;; Actual fighting strength &quot; means the strength of fighting formations less employed mensuch as clerks, drivers. &amp;c.
