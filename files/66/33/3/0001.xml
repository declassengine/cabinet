THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1943.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 3. /January 4, 1943. /TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK \^fD KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ARRIVALS OF UNITED STATES FORCES IN THEUNITED KINGDOM.Note by the Prime Minister.MY colleagues may be interested to see this forecast of the arrivals ofUnited States forces in the United Kingdom as it stood on the 30th July, 1942.I showed this list to M. Stalin in Moscow, but did not allow him to keep a copy,as I said it was &quot; an American secret.&quot; It seems to me surprising that we shouldhave been led to believe that such importations were possible, in view of the limited figures now put forward. Moreover, as late as the 30th July. 1942, it was contemplated that all the landing craft, equipment, training, &amp;c, would beavailable for an expedition of 27 American and 21 British divisions to theContinent.I think it is probable that very full explanations of these changes will berequired by the Russians at some time or other. The adoption of &quot; Torch,&quot;entailing the movement so far of only 8 divisions, is a very partial excuse.w. s. c.10 Downing Street. S.W. 1,[24848aJ
