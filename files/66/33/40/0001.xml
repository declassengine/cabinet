THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT  1Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 40.January 25, 1943.war CABINET.EEPORT FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER 1942 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.General Position.1. The Christmas season of 1942 was the occasion for gratified comparisonsbetween the present war situation and that of previous war-time Christmases,the transformation effected on all fronts during the last few weeks of the yearbeing considered as beyond the bounds of possibility six months ago. Statesmenand press alike, however, took the opportunity of repeating the warnings againstcomplacency and easy optimism. The press maintained a steady and reasonableline as the slowing down of the Allied progress in North Africa became apparent,and, though comment was at times slightly dispirited, it was realised that thetask of ridding North Africa of the Germans and Italians would take longer than was at first hoped.2. French politics, and particularly the Darlan affair, continued to excitemuch interest throughout December. Some newspapers justified the allied policy of co-operation with Darlan on grounds of expediency, but the generalreaction seemed to be one rather of indignation, and even shame, that a formerenemy should have been welcomed as an ally while the Fighting French &quot; whosevoice alone had brought comfort, hope and encouragement to the French people,&quot;were put in the shade. The State Department at Washington came in for much press criticism on the score of the alleged American backing of Darlan,but, simultaneously with the desire that Great Britain should dissociate herselffrom the United States in this matter, misgivings were expressed lest any splitshould come about between Britain and the United States. The public hasclearly remained uneasy, and a clarification of the situation at the earliestpossible moment is felt to be desirable. Disquieting suggestions have appeared in the Globe Mail to the effect that what had been represented as militaryexpediency was at bottom a contest between Britain and the United States for political and diplomatic control in North Africa. Mr. W. C. Bullitt, formerUnited States Ambassador to France, and present Adviser to the President and state Department on French Affairs, was said to be &quot; suspicious that britain would use her influence with the Fighting French and Allied Governments inLondon for diplomatic advantages at the peace-table,&quot; hence the idea of a newUnited States sponsored French Government for North Africa, and Washing-ton^ consistent opposition to the Fighting French efforts to get the control ofthe French possessions away from the men of Vichy. When news of admiral darlan&apos;s assassination was received, the press tactfully concentrated on welcomingGeneral Giraud, who &quot; hates Germans and has had no truck with traitors.&quot;[24935] B
3.   General Franco&apos;s speech in praise of the Germans was regarded asmere.window-dressing to placate the Nazis.   The United States State Depart-menfs dealings with the Archduke Otto have several times been the subject of  &apos;&apos;disapproving comment.4. Against, this sorry, tangled background of intrigue, the magnificentresistance of the Russians has continued to arouse the admiration even of those sections of the Canadian press which normally are nervous of Russian political influence.5. Prominence was given to the speeches of Lord Cranborne in Englandand the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada, on Colonial policy and&apos;in this connexion, resentment still smoulders against Mr. Willkie&apos;s earliercriticisms. Lord Halifax is thought to have done a very good piece of work by his Baltimore speech, in which he presented the case for the British Empirebefore the tribunal of the United States public.6. With regard to India, public opinion is, on the whole, sympathetictowards Britain&quot; s difficulties in India, and approves the way in which thesituation has been handled. A Gallup poll on the question &quot;Do you thinkBritain has been wise or unwise in her recent handling of the situation inIndia? &quot; showed 51 per cent, thinking Britain wise, and 21 per cent, unwise.7. Events in the Pacific have been little to the fore, though the fall ofBuna was welcomed as a significant advance.8. The Montreal Star on the 10th December paid a high tribute to the NewZealand Forces of all arms and to the spirit of the New Zealand, which itdescribed as a &quot; model for all United Nations.&quot;9. The election of Mr. John Bracken as Leader of the Conservative Party in succession to Mr. Arthur Meighen, in the second week of December, has been thechief event in home affairs, and has received a generous welcome from the press of all shades of opinion. For the past twenty years Mr. Bracken has been theLiberal-Progressive Premier of Manitoba, a virtual Freetrader and a championof farming interests. This is his first entry into Federal politics, and his electionas Leader of a party to some of whose tenets, e.g., protection, he has always been opposed would seem to indicate that Conservatives realised the need for a moreprogressive policy and were ready to go to exceptional lengths of unorthodox^in order to obtain it. The Prime Minister has announced that the Governmentwill put no obstacle in the way of Mr. Bracken&apos;s entry into the House of Commons,but there is a possibility that this will be opposed by the increasingly influentialC.C.F. At Mr. Bracken&apos;s instigation, the Conservative Party has agreed to theParty being renamed &quot; Progressive Conservative.&quot; Its new policy combinesmeasures for increased social security, with simultaneous emphasis on the rightsof private enterprise. The United Kingdom High Commissioner does not considerthat, at the present time at least, the Liberal Party led by Mr. Mackenzie King-has much to fear from the new rival.10. The problem of Canadian man-power was brought sensationally to thefront recently by the resignation of the Director of National Selective Service,Mr. Elliott Little, who publicly attributed his lack of progress to his lack of support from the Minister of Labour. For a time controversy raged over the merits of Mr. Little and Mr. Mitchell, but this is now subsiding. Mr. LittkVsresignation brought the work of National Selective Service to a temporary stand-still, and, as a result of the controversy, the Federal Government appears anxiousat present to avoid any drastic measures which might again draw public attentionunduly to the subject. It is doubtful how much longer Canada will be able tomake ends meet in the matter of man-power, but, if there are no unforeseen heavy demands, it seems possible that both the Services and war industry may be keptsupplied under the present arrangements.11.   In December Mr. Mackenzie King paid a two-day visit to Washington,during which he conferred with the President, and also with Mr. Cordell Hull.12.   The decision on the part of the British authorities to end the shacklingof German prisoners has been acclaimed with general satisfaction.13. The Beveridge Report, which has been separately published in Canada,created an immense amount of interest, and it has led to a renewal of thediscussion on post-war planning in Canada. The Report gave rise to anabundance of mous platitudes on the subject of social welfare programmes in
general, and comment was coloured by the political views held by the various   163schools of thought; but the Report has brought to the fore a discussion on thepossibility of the adoption of similar measures in Canada.14. In furtherance of its anti-inflationary policy, and in the effort to keepdown the cost of living, the Government announced in December forthcomingreductions in the price of certain foodstuffs to be brought about by means of subsidies. These subsidies will be a serious drain on the Exchequer; and further measures to reduce the purchasing power of consumers by the imposition ofadditional taxation, &amp;c, are realised to be necessary, and are believed to be underconsideration by the War-time Prices and Trade Board.Naval, Military and Air Activities.Canadian Military Position December 1942.15. Royal Canadian Navy. The Royal Canadian Navy now has a strengthof about 50,000 men and has in commission approximately 500 ships. Its mainrole is escort duty for Atlantic shipping.16.   Man-Power. The allocation of man-power among the various war requirements is at present as follows : Total population......... 11,500,000Active Armed Forces     ...       ... 535,000Engaged in war production     ... 900,000   (including 150,000 women)Engaged in essential industries,such as mining, utilities, &amp;c. 300,000Engaged in civilian industry   ... 2,000,000   (it is estimated that someEngaged in agriculture ...       ...       1,250,000500,000 can still be divertedwithout seriously affectinginternal economy)These figures show that a large percentage of the available man-power isbeing effectively used.s While conscription for war service, although authorised,has not been put into effect, a programme of National Selective Service was intro-duced this year carrying with it a large measure of compulsion. This means thatcertain occupations are denied to physically fit men of military age, that no personmay change his or her employment except under the control of National SelectiveService, and that employees may be transferred from non-essential work to war industries as necessary.17. The Army in Canada. -The Canadian Army, exclusive of its reserveformations, has a total strength of 412,815, of which 230,331 all ranks are inCanada and 182,484 are abroad. The total enlistments in Canada for active service is averaging about 2,400 per week.The army in Canada is composed essentially of three infantry divisions, coast and A.A. defence units and the recruiting and instructional organisations. the divisions are organised on a Brigade Group basis, and are distributed fiveBrigades in Pacific Command and four in Atlantic Command for the defence ofthose two coasts.18. The Army outside Canada. While most of the army outside Canada isin the United Kingdom, there are small forces in other parts of the worldemployed on the defence of vulnerable points. These forces are now in Newfound-land, Bermuda, Nassau and British Guiana, and have,a total strength of 7,068.The Canadian Force which was sent to Hong Kong was about 2,000 all ranks.19. Canadian A rmy in the United Kingdom. The main weight ofCanada&apos;s Army is in the United Kingdom. The total strength here is 175,416, ofwhich some 128,664 are in First Canadian Army, the balance being made up of reinforcements, the Forestry Corps and the numerous smaller units of a staticnature which would continue to function in this country even after FirstCanadian Army goes abroad. Those reinforcements and units which are not an integral part of First Canadian Army are controlled by Canadian Military Head-quarters in London. This Headquarters serves also as an advanced echelon ofNational Defence Headquarters (Ottawa) for its business with the War Officeand the other Dominions, and carries out the general administration of the wholeof the Canadian Army in the United Kingdom.[24935j b 2
20. The First Canadian Army now consists of one Corps of three infantry divisions plus two armoured divisions and an army tank brigade with a propor-tion of Army, G.H.Q. and L. of C. troops. The second Corps will probably be constituted very soon, and the second tank brigade, which is still in Canada, willbe brought overseas as soon as the reinforcement situation is improved and shipping permits. The intended operational role and the ultimate detailedcomposition of the Army are now under discussion with the War Office, but, untilthose decisions are i&apos;reached, it is not possible to give further information regardingits organisation. It is very probable, however, that the armoured divisions willbe changed from the old to the new type, and that unit organisations and WarEstablishments will be brought closer into line with corresponding War OfficeE s t a b 1 i shmen ts.21.   Royal Canadian Air Force. The main Canadian contribution to theair effort has been directly concerned with the Air Training Plan.   Of the total-,..,^,^fl^estimated cost of the original plan of/ l,043,400 Canacla&apos;s share was( 4rg4g^8&amp;.I o^l By a new agreement this original project has been doubled.   The totfoTTaitput oOair crew personnel stood at 116,000 about a month ago. 1^13^ 33^o?0O22. It can thus be seen that Canada is now approaching a 100 per cent, war effort in all spheres of activity. The first year of the Avar was mainly devoted toplanning and organisation, the second year to expansion and construction, and inthis third year the results of that earlier organisation and planning are becomingapparent in the armed forces and in industrial production. Neither have quitereached their peaks yet, but that time is not far away.23. Operations. Royal Canadian Air Force. During December there were31 R.C.A.F. squadrons in overseas theatres of war; of these 20 were active in theUnited Kingdom, two in other parts of the world, and nine inactive in the UnitedKingdom. Of those nominated inactive, three were in process of conversion to adifferent type of aircraft and the remaining six were in process of forming andthus non-operational. Of the two overseas squadrons, one is in India and one inEgypt.24. The R.C.A.F. squadrons in the United Kingdom increased their opera-tional flying time by about 15/20 per cent, as compared with last month; this increase, which was common to almost every squadron, was due to improved flyingconditions and was mainly accounted for by the increase in the activities of the fighter squadrons which carried out many sweeps and on several occasions escortedaircraft of the United States Army Air Force. There was only a small increase inactivity of the bomber squadrons, partly because one heavy bomber squadron wasin process of conversion to a new type and the new medium bomber squadrons hadnot become fully operational. Two medium bomber squadrons had a busy month,taking part in raids on Turin, Duisburg and Mannheim. Two army co-operativesquadrons were engaged on routine patrols.25. In spite of the increase in operational flying time there are fewincidents to record, largely on account of a lack of enterprise and inactivity on thepart of the German Air Force in Western Europe. During the month threebombers and four fighters were posted as missing.26. A noteworthy incident was the performance of Sergeant Ellergodt,415 Torpedo-Bomber Squadron, who succeeded in bringing home his aircraft froman attack on an enemy convoy after three shells had burst in the fuselagedestroying practically all the instruments.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.General Position.27. Optimism about the war situation has been fairly general throughoutAustralia and, as a consequence, complacency has been greater than at any time since Japan&apos;s entry into the war. There is a widespread lack of appreciation ofwarnings that recent events are but a beginning of the task confronting theUnited Nations, and disappointment at the slowness of the Allied progress in tunisia and Libya. The most recent Russian successes have been hailed with much enthusiasm and Russia&apos;s &quot; almost inhuman patience and fortitude &quot; are held to be beyond praise.28. In North Africa the situation continues to be viewed with distaste andanxiety. Although the military advantages of the arrangement with admiral darlan were seen to be incontrovertible, the political situation was felt to be
increasingly embarrassing for the Allies. The assassination of the Admiral wastherefore received as a solution of a tricky problem : &quot; Duplicity brings its ownreward.&quot; The appointment of General Giraud as his successor is welcomed. Ofr the Australian newspapers, the Catholic Advocate alone regarded Darlanfavourably as a bulwark against &quot; the Bolshevist menace.&quot;29. The scuttling of the French fleet at Toulon produced mixed reactions,some papers endorsing the official United Kingdom view, unreservedly payingtribute to the sacrifice and heroism of the French naval personnel concerned, while others took a less enthusiastic line, describing the event as &quot;an inglorious but notdishonourable episode.&quot;30. General Smuts&apos;s article on the Colonies has attracted considerable attention in Australia.31. The Melbourne Herald suggested that, although relations between theUnited Kingdom and Australia are good, they might be improved still furtherby increased contact between those in charge of affairs in the two countries, andholds that a visit by a United Kingdom Minister to Australia is desirable.32. The Beveridge Report created a favourable impression on economists .and politicians alike, and comparisons have been drawn between United Kingdomschemes of social insurance and those in operation in Australia. Opinion is divided between those who think that Australia is in the happy position of notneeding social security provision on anything like the scale contemplated in the beveridge Report and those who believe that the scheme now being prepared inAustralia will be found to be on a more generous scale still. The press paid a tribute to those in the United Kingdom responsible for the production of such areport during a time of acute national emergency.33. In home affairs, discussion of the implications of the ConstitutionAmendment Bill, to which reference was made in last month&apos;s report, has con-tinued. The agreement of the States&apos; Governments to delegate certain powers tothe Federal Government is generally approved, but, in a speech at Melbourne,Mr. Menzies issued a warning in emphatic terms against the dangers of over-centralisation. The New South Wales Parliament is reported as having passed aBill transferring the powers mentioned to the Commonwealth by 61 votes to 7.34. Other topics which have occupied the attention of the public have beenMr. Curtin&apos;s proposal for the merger of the Australian Militia Forces with theAustralian Imperial Forces, thus enabling them to be used outside Australia.Mr. Curtin&apos;s proposal was hotly contested within the Labour party itself, but was eventually adopted at the Federal Conference of the Australian Labour party,and the way is now clear for the Government to send all Australian troops any-where in the South-West Pacific.35. The outcry over the proposed restrictions on the employment of domestic servants quickly led to a withdrawal of this suggestion. The Government lostprestige over the handling of this matter by the Department of War Organisa-tion of Industry, the proposed measures being generally regarded as useless fromthe man-power point of view, and prompted by class prejudice.36. The Austerity Loan of  100 million was over-subscribed by some 4 million. The disappointing contributions from small subscribers are thought to augur ill for further loans which will be needed, and regarded as bringing the necessity for compulsion nearer.37. Some 35,000 workers disregarded a Government order that New Year&apos;sDay was not to be taken as a holiday, and absented themselves from work. Publicindignation was acute, and there was wholesale condemnation in the press of thisexample of absenteeism. The Commonwealth Government has been muchcriticised for its inability to enforce its wishes, and it is now contemplating strongmeasures to deal with absenteeism in industry, and prosecutions are to be launchedon a wide scale.38. The Commonwealth Government has decided to lift the ban on theCommunist party, which was declared to be an illegal association in 1940.39. The United Kingdom High Commissioner has reported on the probable effects of the legislation passed in June last by the Commonwealth parliament for the imposition of one uniform tax on incomes throughout Australia for theperiod of the war and for one year thereafter. Under the terms of the Constitu-tion the Commonwealth Parliament was given the exclusive power to impose
customs and excise duties, and the Commonwealth and State Parliaments weregiven concurrent powers of taxation in all other ways, the Commonwealth beingresponsible for the provision, for a period, of surplus Commonwealth revenuesnot required by it, to the States, and for other financial aid.The Commonwealth Government first imposed taxes on incomes in 1916.since when Commonwealth and States have shared this field of taxation. As aresult of the present war the Commonwealth Government found itself faced withheavily increased expenditure, and, at the same time, limited control over themain field from which direct tuxes could be raised, and with no effective controlover revenues raised by the States from the same field.In April 1942 the Prime Minister put before the State Premiers proposals that, for the war period and one year thereafter, the Commonwealth should bethe sole taxation authority in the income-tax field, the States to receive compensa-tion for giving up their rights in this field.These proposals were unanimously rejected by the States, who declared thatthey amounted to virtual unification, which, in essence, had nothing to do withthe war. The Commonwealth Government, however, ignoring State protests,passed legislation (the Uniform Taxation Act see report for June 1942) giving effect to the proposals, and four out of the six States thereupon sought a declara-tion by the High Court that the Commonwealth act was invalid, and an injunctionrestraining the Commonwealth from putting it into operation. On the 23rd july the High Court, by a majority, held that the scheme as a whole was valid.The High Commissioner reports that there seems little doubt that uniformtaxation has come to stay, and that the measure is an important step towardsunification.Naval, Military and Air Activities.40.   Two new minesweepers were launched for the Royal Australian Navyduring December and one was commissioned.41.   Two additional fuel oil tanks, with combined capacity of 36,000 tons,have been completed at Fremantle.42. United States army forces in Australia in December numbered 65,105,including 18,315 serving with New Guinea force. United States forces inAustralia, including air corps and anti-aircraft units, totalled 106,835.43. There were also more than 1.200 tanks in Australia, composed as follows :Matilda 289, M.3 light tanks 233 and M.3 medium tanks 741; both M.3 types areof United States manufacture.44. The Japanese have been steadily reinforcing their troops in Timor; afurther 2,000 Japanese arrived in Dilli at the end of November. The japanese are reported to be building an airfield in the Laga area, and also at a locality ninemiles south-east of Lautem.NEW ZEALAND.General Position.45. There have been few signs of impatience or disappointment at theslowing down of Allied progress in North Africa, but there was much uneasinessover the Darlan negotiations, which even his death has not altogether removed.46. The striking Russian victories evoked great satisfaction, but, withthe press announcement of fresh victories almost every day during this greatoffensive, the public has of late been showing signs of scepticism.47. Operations in the Pacific were reported in detail, and once again fearswere expressed that the importance of this theatre of war was being under-estimated in London and Washington. The-prediction of Admiral Halsey (which,according to information from the United Kingdom High Commissioner, was,,issued primarily with an eye to Japanese morale) of &apos;1 the complete defeat of the axis in 1943 &quot; was contrasted with expressions of dissatisfaction by GeneralChiang Kai-shek and Mr. Curtin regarding the provision of adequate forces forthe war against Japan.48. The Beveridge Report aroused very great interest throughout NewZealand. The Prime Minister and his Labour colleagues were particularlygratified by Sir William Beveridge&apos;s reference to the resemblance of his proposals to the New Zealand Social Security Scheme.
49.   Prominence was given to Lord Cranborne&apos;s speech on Colonial policy,and to the views expressed by General Smuts on this subject.   In this connexionC the Auckland Herald deprecated uninformed criticism of Britain by the United.States.50. The suspension of firewatching, and of most black-out restrictions,contributed during December to a cheerful mood on the part of the general public.This mood was fostered, too, by a heartening statement by the General OfficerCommanding New Zealand Forces, that the arrival of very large quantities of equipment had considerably strengthened New Zealand&apos;s position in recent months.Prominence was given to Mr. Fraser&apos;s statement that the Government felt able,in view of the improvement in the Pacific situation, to review the whole man-power situation with reference to the possibility of releasing men from the army for other needs. In Auckland organisations representing Labour, employers,farmers, and commerce, expressed their &quot; grave misgivings &quot; at the proposal that new Zealand should support a large force on active service in the Pacific, andadvocated the release of man-power from the army in the South Pacific (but notin the Middle East) to increase production. The United Kingdom High Com-misioner thinks that, in proposing to modify the man-power programme, and in reducing A.P.P. restrictions, the Government was influenced by the approach of anumber of bye-elections.51. Opinion remains divided over the question of the return of the NewZealand division from the Middle East. A newspaper campaign for this has dieddown, the Auckland Herald holding that the Middle East should have priority over the Pacific. This view, however, cannot be taken as representative of NewZealand opinion as a whole.52. Some resentment has been shown in consequence of a leader in theChicago Daily Tribune, in which it was suggested that New Zealand and australia &quot; might be incorporated, with the United States.&quot;53. The vacancy in the New Zealand Cabinet caused by the death ofMr. H. T. Armstrong, Minister of Public Works and Housing, has been filled by Mr. James 0&apos;Brien, who represented Westland, and has &quot;been a member ofParliament for 17 years. He has taken the portfolios of Transport and Marine,formerly held by Mr. Semple. Mr. Semple takes over the late Mr. Armstrong^portfolios and retains those of Railways and Rehabilitation.Naval, Military and Air Activities.54. H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles and H.M.N.Z.S. Monowai were engaged with united States Task Forces in the South Pacific area. H.M.N.Z.S. Leander wasrefitting at Auckland.55. The 2nd New Zealand Division spent the month of December re-organising and clearing up in the Nofilia area of Tripolitania.56. New Zealand is assuming responsibility for the military defence ofTonga; the personnel of the force there at present is being replaced and inaddition key personnel are being sent from New Zealand for the expansion ofthe local defence force.57. Additional units totalling 554 officers and 8,257 other ranks were sentto the 3rd New Zealand Division in New Caledonia during the month. A draftof reinforcements also embarked for the Middle East.58. Following the arrival in New Zealand of additional artillery equipmentcertain reallotments have been possible as follows : (a) artillery units have been taking over 6-pound.er anti-tank guns and transferring their 2-pounders to the infantry; (b) the re-equipment of Field Regiments with 25-pounders is now almostfinished; their 18-pounders, 4-5-inch howitzers and 155 mm. field guns have been handed over to the Home Guard.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.General Position.59. The apparent check in North Africa is regarded by pro-Governmentopinion as no more than a salutary antidote to over-optimism. Enemy resistance in Tunisia is recognised as being remarkably vigorous, though the outcome of thestruggle is not considered to be in doubt.   The Opposition press has shown signs
sof malicious pleasure at Allied disappointments. On the other hand, the Russianvictories have impressed all shades of opinion.60. The assassination of Darlan is regarded as providing a speedy and final solution to an increasingly difficult problem in North Africa, and it isthought that his replacement by General Giraud will, in the long run, be of great benefit to the Allied cause.61. The Beveridge Report gave rise to much comment in papers of bothfactions. The Opposition press generally deprecated the plan as consisting ofeveryday things &quot; falling far short of the miracles which people were being ledto expect in the post-war world, but such peevish criticism is not characteristic ofSouth African opinion as a whole. It is felt that the Report will be of inestimablevalue to South Africa in the formation of its own social security code.62. Mr. Eden&apos;s statement on the persecution of the Jews was given muchprominence. A petition, signed by some 18.000 South African Jews, urging theimmediate formation of a Jewish army, has been presented to General Smuts.Opposition papers have not missed the opportunity of recapitulating Jewishgrievances against British rule in Palestine.63. In home affairs, General Smuts?s announcement of the intended employ-ment of South African forces outside Africa has been the occasion of somecomment from the Opposition. Pro-Government opinion accepted the proposal as a logical development of the present position, but controversy still rages. the nationalists, having previously dallied with the idea of an Axis victory, are nowopenly founding their plans on the prospects of an Allied victory. It is significant that their attacks on General Smuts, whom they now realise is responsible for having placed the Union on the winning side, have ceased. They are, instead,concentrating their energies on opposing the Government plans for dual mediumschools, and for putting an end to the segregation of Afrikaans-speaking and english-speaking children. Since the death of General Hertzog. the tendency of the various Opposition political factions is to consolidate under the leadership of Dr. Malan.64. In view of the growing co-operation between the Trades Unions and theLabour party, a considerable addition to the strength&apos;of the party may result from a tentative agreement for federation reached at a conference of four TradesUnion organisations held under the auspices of the Minister of Labour.65. Speculation as to election possibilities continues. General Smuts has declared his intention of not committing himself on the issue until the last possibleminute.66. The public has been considerably disturbed by the number of sinkingswhich are taking place in the Mozambique channel. The enemy are thought to beexploiting the neutrality of Portuguese East Africa to their own advantage, and,in particular, it has been suggested that Lourengo Marquesas being used as afuelling base for submarines, and that it may prove the &quot; Achilles heel &quot; of theUnion.67. Three strikes have taken place, within a fortnight, of native workers on the Rand. These have drawn public attention to the growing discontent of the natives with low wages, and to the increasingly effective organisation of nativeworkers in trades unions. Opposition papers declare that the strikes are the direct result of the Governments &quot; opening the door to Communism.&quot;68. Cabinet changes in the Union include the resignation of Mr. Stuttaford,Minister of Commerce and Industries. He is to be succeeded by Mr. Sidney EWaterson, who for the past three years has been the Union High commissioner in London. Mr. P. V. G. van der Byl, Minister without Portfolio, has beenappointed Minister for Native Affairs. Mr. Waterson is succeeded as HighCommissioner in the United Kingdom by Colonel Deneys Reitz, formerly deputy prime Minister in the Union, and Minister for Native Affairs.Naval, Military and A ir A activities.69. Navy. There are now 59 vessels in commission. Routine submarine patrols were carried out from Durban and Cape Town. Vessels of the naval forces were actively engaged in the rescue of survivors of ships torpedoed off SouthAfrican coasts. His Majesty&apos;s South African salvage vessel Gamtoos has joined the Mediterranean station.
70. Army. Major-General D. H. Pienaar, C.B., D.S.O., commanding FirstSouth African Division, was killed in an air accident on the 20th December whenreturning from the Middle East to the Union.Military Personnel State.71. At the end of the year the European strength of the Union of SouthAfrica army forces on full-time service was 15,343 officers and 132,395 other ranks; the South African Air Force comprised 5,124 officers and 31,443 other ranks, and South Africans on the strength of the Royal Air Force numbered804 officers and 12,853 other ranks.Economic and Financial.72. The Chancellor of the Exchequer discussed with General Smuts duringthe latter&apos;s visit to London certain financial questions outstanding between theUnited Kingdom and Union Governments. The Chancellor subsequently wrote to General Smuts (a) proposing that South Africa should make available to the UnitedKingdom against sterling, should the United Kingdom so desire, gold to the value of  90 million a year from the 1st January, 1943,including gold used to acquire sterling for South Africa&apos;s currentrequirements;(b) offering, if arrangements were made on these lines, to arrange for there patriation of about  40 million of Union sterling securities held inLondon, the operation to be financed by the sale of part of the goldat present held in the Union;(c) stating that the United Kingdom Government would do all that is inits power to help South Africa to secure machinery for the gold mines;and(d) expressing the hope that it would be possible to arrange for a satisfactory settlement on broad lines of various outstanding matters relating to military expenditure.After his return to South Africa, General Smuts replied to the effect thatthe Union Government saw no difficulty in making up to  90 million of goldavailable in 1943, provided that the production of gold were maintained.Arrangements were accordingly put in hand for the repatriation of the securitiesmentioned above, and Vesting Orders w-ere made on the 18th December.73. The Union Government announced during December that a reductionby one-third of the basic petrol ration would take effect from the 1st January.The reduced ration will allow an approximate mileage of 200 miles a month in place of the previous 300 miles.EIRE.74. Mr. de Valera made his usual broadcast to the people of Eire on christmas night. He said that while the country must make every possiblepreparation to meet the dangers ahead and could look into the future only withanxiety, there was no reason why they should look into it with dread. It wasa settled part of Eire&apos;s policy that they should defend themselves if attacked and that they should fight with all their strength until the attacker should be defeated. Speaking of the day when peace w^ould come, he said that it wouldbe hard to convince the victors that their safety would not depend on the utterhumiliation of the vanquished. All modern experience showed that a peace- conceived in those terms was but a war deferred. It was only a peacefounded on justice and charity that could bring with it the sanctions that would cause it to endure.75. On the 9th December Mr. de Valera announced that &quot; unless some-thing extraordinary happened &quot; a general election would not be held beforethe reassembly of the Dail on the 3rd February. Meanwhile, Ministers continueto make speeches setting forth their views on the coming election. Speakingin Dublin on the 6th December, Mr. MacEntee, the Minister for Local Govern-ment, said that there was no doubt that Mr. de Valera would like to avoid ageneral election, but he certainly would not avoid it if the price was going tobe that Eire should have a weak and irresolute Government ,which would be atemptation to outside interests to try and secure all the advantages which an.occupation of that territory would bring them.   &quot; If we want to have a Govern-[249351
meiit in this country it must be a Government in accordance withthe terms of the Constitution, or else change and tear up theConstitution. The Irish people want it to be a Government of their ownelection, a Government that will have regard to the principles of individual and human liberty. Those who want us to choose Governments in that wayhave to remember that there are people outside the Dail who have been carryingon a lawless policy for the last four or five years without moral basis orjustification for it and who have come along and said that the Dail was changing the Constitution to extend its own life in order to keep a few Ministers in office.&quot;76. Speaking on the same day, Mr. Norton, the leader of the Labour Party,said that Labour would fight the general election on a bold, progressive policyof agricultural and economic reconstruction, designing to make the farmerprosperous, his workers well paid and giving to the town worker a decent standardof living, worthy of the dignity of human beings. &quot; No matter what the resultof the election, the people would stand uncompromisingly for neutrality.&quot;77. In the course of a speech in Dublin on the 1st December, Mr. Traynor,the Minister of Defence, said that the agreement made with Great Britain in1938 giving Eire back her ports, had been honourably kept by both nations todate. &quot; It was his earnest hope that, in the interests of the people of Eire, theposition would be maintained.78. The Eire Government have taken further steps under the emergency powers Order to regulate emigration and to enforce the regulations which havealready been imposed. It is not expected that the Order recently publishedwill materially affect the existing flow of labour from Eire to the United Kingdom,which remains substantial despite the Eire Governments special measures to conserve labour for turf-cutting and agriculture.79. Statistics issued at the end of December showed a surplus of  753.079of exports over imports during November. Total imports at  2,238.171 were 113,381 less than in November 1941, while the total exports at  2,791,250 were 1,504,946 less.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political Situation.80. Morale is steady. Impatience for results in Tunisia is balanced bysatisfaction over the continued retreat of RommeEs forces and by the victoriesachieved by the Russian offensives. Local food shortages and rising prices are for most people the most pressing problem. Calcutta&apos;s reactions to its first air raids seem on the whole to have been reassuring.81. The political situation remains unchanged. The &quot; Congress rebellion &quot;has degenerated into spasmodic terrorist outrages. No significant development isexpected from the meeting of the Indian Non-Party Conference which was heldin the middle of the month under the presidency of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru andwas attended by Mr. Rajagopalachari. The Hindu Mahasabha meeting at theend of the month was loud in its denunciations of the Pakistan aims of the moslem League. An event likely to have more important consequences thanthese meetings on the political situation, at least in the Punjab, was the suddenand untimely death on the 26th December of the Punjab Premier, Sir SikanderHyat Khan, who, apart from his distinguished services to India and the Empire,served his Province well by fostering co-operation between the variouscommunities and refusing to subscribe to the more extreme claims of the moslem league. He has been succeeded as Premier by Malik Khizar Hayat Khan Tiwana,who was holding the Public Works portfolio in his Cabinet. The new Premiercomes of a very influential Punjab family with a long record of loyalty to theBritish connection.Indian States.82.   There is nothing of special significance to report.External and Frontier Affairs.83. Afghanistan. Relations with the Afghan Government remain unchanged. Since M. Chataigneau, the late Vichy &quot;Minister, left Kabul in themiddle of the month, the Afghans have requested the grant of a visa to transit
India en route for Turkey to M. Cassin, the Charge d.&apos;Affaires. The ostensiblereason for this request was ill-health, but in fact the Afghan Government had informed the &quot;Vichy Government that M. Cassin was no longer persona grata andhad pressed for his removal. M. Cassin has expressed the wish to join general de Gaulle.Afghan officials were much impressed by Allied successes in the varioustheatres&quot; of war, and Allied stock rose higher in Afghan eyes than it has been for several months.84. The North-West Frontier. The frontier has remained generally quiet,though the shortage and high prices of food and other supplies in Waziristancaused uneasiness. Towards the end of the month there was an increase inlawlessness for which deserters in North Waziristan and a gang of Afghanoutlaws in South Waziristan were mainly responsible. Casualties were, however,inflicted on the hostiles and during the month four notorious hostiles surrendered to Government.85. Tibet. The Chinese do not appear to have made any move in thedirection of opening negotiations for the pack supply route either with theTibetan Government or with Tibetan transport firms. Meanwhile the Tibetan-Government has let us know that, though reluctantly prepared to negotiate direct with the Chinese in the matter, they regard it as essential to have the guarantee of His Majesty&apos;s Government behind any contracts entered into with the Chinese.There is some indication that the Chinese have begun to send supplies throughthe ordinary trade channels by arrangements with Tibetan firms, and it is possiblethat as a face-saving solution they may intend to expand these arrangements,thus doing away with the necessity for negotiating any special contracts.80. China. India was a party to the China Treaty. Owing to the shortnessof notice it was not possible to arrange for Mr. Caroe, the Secretary to theGovernment of India in the External Affairs Department, to visit Chungking to sign on behalf of India, and Mr. Richardson, who has been in charge of the officeof Agent-General for India since the departure of Sir M. Zafrullah Khan, signed in his place.87. The Persian Gulf. The Russian offensive and continued Alliedsuccesses in Africa continue to have a good effect on public opinion. The warning to Italy in the Prime Minister&apos;s speech of what she might expect in the futurewas particularly welcomed, owing to the special antipathy of Arabs to theItalians.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.88. Military. Troops of the 14th Indian Division have advanced in NorthArakan and have reached a line 25 miles north of Akyab without opposition,except for a few small patrol encounters, mainly in the initial stages. It wouldappear that the enemy does not intend to stand north of Akyab. Akyab hasbeach as well as land defences, and is believed to be held by infantry and field and A.A. Artillery. Our troops have been well received by the inhabitants andlabour is coming forward well, but there are so far no marked signs of anti-Japanese feeling : the inhabitants do not appear to have been unjustly treated.Patrol encounters have occurred in the Chin Hills area. Reports of Japaneseactivity and preparations for an advance in this area continue.89. There has been no activity in the Upper Chindwin and Hukawngvalley areas.90. General Wavell visited Ceylon during the month. General Stillwellarrived in Delhi from China for consultations.91. A corps of Indian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers has beenformed with functions similar to the R.E.M.E.92. Over 20,000 Chinese troops have now been flown to India for training under American direction.93. As regards the internal situation, isolated sabotage incidents continueto occur. The number of Field Army Battalions employed on internal security and railway protection had been reduced to about four by early in December.(These exclude units which are normally employed on internal security and railwayprotection.) Since then, however, it has been found necessary to allot a furthernine battalions for railway protection duties. (In August last a total of57- - battalions were required mainly for railway protection.)[24935] C 2
94. 53,000 recruits were enrolled in October. Malaria and season agricul-ture restricted the intake.   The November intake was estimated at 56,000.95. The Women&apos;s Auxiliary Corps (India) now numbers 161 officers and2,790 auxiliaries. Arrangements are being made to utilise women in Anti-Aircraft Batteries, as in England.96. 2,700 Transport animals in the Eastern Army, have been affected by an outbreak of Surra, which started in August and has not yet been finally checked.97. Among schemes for post-war reconstruction the Government of theNorth-West Frontier Province are examining one for the encouragement of fruitfarming by ex-soldiers. A draft scheme for the formation of a Corps of Commis-sionaires, India, has been completed.98. The issue of rations on payment, subject to certain monetary limits, hasbeen authorised to British officers and other ranks, members of the W.A.C. (I)and separated families.   This should ease the cost of living situation.99. Air. In spite of some bad weather the R.A.F. and U.S.A.A.F. have continued to carry out attacks on enemy aerodromes and communications by day and night,100. The enemy made three air raids on Chittagong in the first half ofthe month. Damage and casualties, both military and civil, were slight. Theenemy used about thirty machines on each occasion. About a dozen were destroyed. Civilian morale was surprisingly steady, though after the third raida good deal of evacuation took place.101. Raids have also been carried out on Calcutta, but damage and casualties were slight, Morale in the damaged areas was not unduly affected,although there was a considerable exodus by rail. Labour was. however, affected,and there was a large exodus from the clocks area. Transportation and Pioneerunits are being provided to keep the docks working.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Conditions in Occupied Burma.102. The Governor considers that, while the administration which theJapanese have set up, backed by intensive propaganda, is conducive to someillusion of freedom, any resulting pro-Japanese sentiment is offset by the generalbelief that the British are certain to return, and that for this reason resistance toour troops on the part of the Burmese is unlikely, and their co-operation is pro-bable, especially if they are well treated and their fear of reprisals is allayed.103. According to information from a source reported trustworthy someJapanese officers complained to Ba Maw at Myitkyina that nearly half of Burmais controlled by pro-British hill tribes, and threatened that, if the Burmese do notoccupy the hills, the Japanese will be forced to levy from Burma the cost of operations there and an indemnity of Rs. 3,000 for every Japanese killed. If this story (which has some corroboration) is true, the political reaction of the Burmeseis likely to be unfavourable to Japan.Frontier Administration.104. The chief problem confronting the civil organisation is the transportof supplies of rice, salt and other stores for the population in the Chin Hillsand in the Kachin Hills (north of Myitkyina). There is no land route open tothe latter, and there are many calls on that to the former area for military purposes. In the Kachin Hills it is feared that the food shortage will attain the proportions of a general famine before April unless steps are taken now to dealwith the situation; and the Governor fears that in both areas, unless supplies canbe sent, we shall lose the confidence of the civil population and that they may come under Japanese influence. He is therefore very anxious that air transport shouldhe made available, the possibility of which depends on the provision of additionaltransport aircraft to India. It is understood that he is in touch with general headquarters, India, on the subject.105. In Arakan the British troops were well received in Maungdaw andButhidaung. No subversive elements were encountered, but, on the other hand,no extensive anti-Japanese feeling was evident, as the Japanese appear to have
treated the local population well.   While Arakan is an area quite distinct from burma, similar reactions are likely on the occupation of Burma itself.General.106. On the 10th December the Governor published a proclamation underSection 139 of the Government of Burma Act assuming to himself all functionsof government, including those of the Legislature and Ministers. This step wasnecessary since the enemy occupation of Burma makes it impossible to summonthe Legislature and to carry on government in accordance with the provisions ofthe Act.107. Reconstruction committees have been considering education, judicialreforms and the future of the backward hill tracts. The general question ofEuropean recruitment to the services and the man-power likely to be availablelocally, either in the army or in commerce, is also being examined.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Ship/ring.108. Shipment of food-stuffs to the West Indies. It has been arranged by the British Colonies Supply Mission that Canadian ships taking food-stuffs and other requirements to the West Indies, totalling about 8,000 tons of spaceper month, should unload their cargo at Barbados instead of Trinidad. Thiswill relieve congestion at Port of Spain, Trinidad, and make for the speedierhandling of cargo for Barbados and the Leeward and Windward Islands. the cargo will be carried on from Barbados in two steamers that have been madespecially available for this service and in small local vessels that are now, withthese steamers, under the central control of the West Indies Schooner PoolAuthority.Defence.109. Civil Defence. As a result of the -North African campaign signs ofapathy have become evident among the Civil Defence staff in some of the african colonies, and suggestions for overcoming this have been made to various governments.110. The Resident Minister, West Africa, has been informed that it isconsidered that civil defence policy in that area should keep in line with activemilitary policy, and has been asked to review, in consultation with his WarCouncil, the requirements and organisations of the four West African Colonies.111. Ascension Island. The draft Anglo-United States Agreement for theuse of Ascension Island by the United States during the war (see paragraph 110of November Report) has now been examined in London and a number of amend-ments are being proposed to the United States authorities in Washington, throughthe diplomatic channel. British comments on the United States amendments arebeing similarly transmitted.112. Aden. With reference to paragraph 111 of the November Report, theGovernor of Aden has confirmed his agreement with the proposals of R.A.F.Headquarters in the Middie East for the expansion of the Protectorate Leviesby the formation of seven new companies. These proposals have now7 beenapproved.113. Mauritius and Seychelles. Proposals are being discussed with the WarOffice and G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa, for the transfer of full administrative andfinancial control of the Mauritius Territorial Force from the Mauritius Govern-ment to the War Office, subject to the payment of a revised military contributionto the Imperial Exchequer by the Mauritius Government. (Operationally, theForce is already under the control of the G.O.C.-in-C.) The matter is at present under reference to General Platt.114. A similar transfer has been suggested in the case of the SeychellesDefence Force, which is, however, smaller than the Mauritius Territorial Force
and is enrolled on a part-time basis. This question will probably be discussed by the Governor of the Seychelles with General Platt when the former visitsEast Africa in January.Tel. No. 424 115.   British Solomon Islands Protectorate. Reference paragraph 115 offor&quot;wHpac.&apos; L&apos;ie November Report. The High Commissioner for the Western Pacific has completed his visit to Guadalcanal and reported that the following has beenagreed with the United States Commander, South Pacific, and the CommandingGeneral, Guadalcanal : (a) Formation of a Labour Corps mostly composed of Malaita men, withstrength initially of two companies each of 400. Other companies will be raised later if required. The commander of the force will bean officer seconded from the R.A.A.F. Volunteers are coming forwardfreely.(b) Solomon Islands Defence Force.   A Service Battalion is being formed from Guadalcanal native police, guides and scouts. It is to be expanded to include all intelligence and reconnaissance services nowexisting, and will have eight fighting patrols. Its commander will beMr. Clemens, a British officer of the Civil Administration now servingas a temporary Major.Both these units will be under the United States General for operationalpurposes, but for pay, discipline and administration they will be under theBritish Resident Commissioner.116. Barbados. -The Governor of Barbados has concluded an agreementwith the United States General in Trinidad setting out the conditions for theestablishment in Barbados of certain United States military units, consistingof an operative detachment for the servicing of aircraft and a radio intelligenceunit which is part of the United States monitoring service in that area. Theagreement is under consideration in conjunction with the departments concerned and will probably be approved as it stands.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.117. Local politics tend to overshadow the main war issue. The extentto which propaganda has been carried on for the realisation of the maximumpolitical Zionist aspirations in regard to Palestine, to which reference was madein the last report, has caused deep and genuine concern among the Arabs. Thememorandum submitted to President Roosevelt on the 3rd December by membersof the United States Senate and Congress, following on the &quot; declaration &quot; by air. Willkie. quoted in the last report, has had a particularly bad effect. Inaddition, the stress laid in the current campaign to save Jews from Nazi persecu-tion, on throwing open Palestine for refugees, has led to the belief that persistentJewish pressure wall cause the United States of America to insist on, and GreatBritain to acquiesce in, the concession of Palestine to the Jews. There is,however, no reason to fear violent manifestations at present.118. The Jewish community is almost exclusively concerned with the publiccampaign in connection with the persecution of Jews in Nazi Europe. The two main aspects of this campaign have been the demand for increased immigration and the intensification of recruiting propaganda, both of which have been coupled with much publicity over various utterances of politicians and others in theUnited States of America regarding the fulfilment of Zionist aspirations.119. The situation regarding labour disputes has considerably eased duringthe month.120. Jewish enlistment is still on the low side, but Arab enlistment hasshown marked improvement.West Indies.121. Sir Frank Stockclale. Comptroller for Development and Welfare in theWest Indies and British Joint Chairman of the Anglo-American CaribbeanCommission, is at present on a visit to this country and is discussing developmentproblems generally.122. Visit of Representatives of the State Department. Mr. Taussig andMr. De la Rue visited this country from the 9th to the 19th December as represen-tatives of the United States State Department.
Mr. Taussig is a close friend of the President of the United States. He isnow Joint-Chairman with Sir Frank Stockdale of the Anglo-American CaribbeanCommission. Mr. De la Rue is an economic expert. The visit was arranged tofollow after Sir George Gater&apos;s visit to the United States.Mr. Taussig was received by The King and lunched with the Prime Minister.During the whole of his stay here he was in the closest touch with the Secretaryof State and members of the staff of the Colonial Office. The Secretary of Statepresided at four full meetings, at which both Mr. Taussig and Mr. De la. Ruewere present. At the end of their visit an agreed report was drawn up, theprincipal points in which were (a) the approval in principle of the establishmentof a regular system of West Indian conferences, and (b) the agreement that the carrying out of certain development programmes in the British West Indies couldnot safely be postponed until after the war, and that their immediate executionshould be regarded as an urgent war measure. As the result of (b), it is hopedthat Mr. Taussig will be able to obtain from the United States certain articles,such as cement, which will greatly assist development, but which have not hitherto been forthcoming except for direct war objects.The Bahamas.124. Sir Alison Russell has returned to this country and has presented thereport of his Commission into the Bahamas Riots which occurred in NewProvidence. The comments of the Governor on the report have not yet beenreceived.Ceylon.125.   In reply to the Board of Ministers&apos; message requesting an assurance that Dominions status will be conferred on Ceylon after the war, the Governor,as instructed, informed them that the re-examination of the reform of Ceylon&apos;s 11/12/42Constitution after the war, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government stands pledged, .will be directed towards the fullest possible development of self-governing institutions, having regard to the interests both of the Island and of the Common-wealth on which the Island&apos;s security and prosperity ultimately depend.    TheGovernor has now reported that Ministers are considering this reply and willconfer with him on his return to Colombo in January.   In the meantime, he has 22/12/42requested that there should be no publication either of the Ministers&apos; message orof the reply from His Majesty&apos;s Government.East A frica.&apos; &apos; 126. Following upon consultations which took place in the autumn between lord Cranborne and Sir Henry Moore (Governor of Kenya and chairman of theEast African Governors&apos; Conference), the reorganisation of the machinery fordealing with supply and production problems in East Africa has been announced.The Civil Defence and Supply Council under Sir Henry Moore&apos;s chairmanshiphas ceased to exist, and a new body to be called the East African Production and supply Council has been established, which will form part of the Governors&apos;Conference organisation, with a specially selected chairman.In addition to the chairman, the Council is composed of seven directors, eachof whom will have specific functions, such as agricultural production, transporta-tion, &amp;c.; two members to give advice on commercial matters; and such additional members, not exceeding two in respect of each territory, as the Governments con-icerned may nominate to represent them on questions arising out of productionand supply problems in their territories. The directors include five officials andtwo unofficials drawn from Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika and, together withthe chairman and the two advisory members for commerce, form an executive board, which will deal with day-to-day business between meetings of the fullCouncil. The special powers of the chairman of the Governors&apos; Conference (see cabinet Report for April 1942), have hitherto been exercisable only when reasons of special urgency rendered immediate action imperative. This limitation hasbeen removed, and the chairman of the Conference will in future be able to give directions to the Governors of Uganda and Tanganyika and the British Resident,at Zanzibar in all matters affecting the common interests of East Africa in the prosecution of the war. He will still be required to base his directions upon prior consulation with the Governor concerned or the British Resident, unless pre-cluded by urgency, and the Governor or British Resident whose views are over-ridden retains the right to appeal to the Secretary of State, although on urgent matters he will first have to comply with the chairman&apos;s instructions.
West Africa.127. The Resident Minister has shown some concern about.signs of the americans acquiring a dominating position in West Africa as a consequence ofthe part played by them in negotiations with M. Boisson after he had rallied to admiral Darlan. Lord Swinton appears to be specially concerned about theeffect of American activities on African opinion in British West Africa, particu-larly the Gold Coast. It is hoped that the situation may be improved by theearly appointment of a good American representative at Accra, and His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington is being instructed to press for an early appointment.128. An Economic Mission, which will work closely with the United states authorities and also keep in constant touch with the Resident Minister, was sentto West Africa by air towards the end of the month.French West A frica.129. Vice-Admiral Glassford, the officer in charge of the United states military Mission to French West Africa, arrived at Dakar on the 19th December,1942. In a message received by the Joint Staff Mission at Washington on the25th December he reported that M. Boisson had complained that undesirablepropaganda directed at French West Africa continued to be sent out from theBritish-controlled radio at Accra, and that no word had been received concerningthe release of the members of the crew of the French submarine Poncelet fromBritish authorities in West Africa. The message went on to say that, with theexception of five undergoing treatment in hospital, all Allied prisoners andinternees had been released and had been returned to British territory.130. The Resident Minister at Achimota was informed by the ForeignOffice at once that the Fighting French were being advised, in their own interests,to refrain from further attacks on French leaders in North and West Africa, andthat it was important that such attacks should not be made on the Accra radio.As regards French internees. Lord Swinton was informed that it was important,so far as possible, to proceed with their release and repatriation pari passu with what M. Boisson was doing for British and Allied internees. The message saidthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would like Lord Swinton to arrange for thefirst batch of French internees, including the Poncelet crew, to leave immediately,without waiting until the last of our men had actually got back. Lord Swintonwas asked to inform Admiral Glassford and M. Boisson of what he was doing,through the United States Consul.131. As regards the propaganda from Accra, Lord Swinton had reportedthat perusal of scripts of all Fighting French broadcasts, which were the onlyscripts emitted from Accra outside the Gold Coast, showed that these broadcastsdid not give M. Boisson reasonable grounds for complaint. Nor could they beregarded as in any way a breach of the undertaking that wre should not permitpropaganda against M. Boisson or his authority. However, in order to safeguard against risk of further misrepresentations by M. Boisson, Lord Swinton had made arrangements for precensorship as well as a check of broadcast utteranceswith approved script, and for the time being he has arranged that the stations should be temporarily closed for technical reasons.As regards prisoners and internees, Lord Swinton is proceeding in accordancewith the instructions referred to above. On the 1st of January. 1943, he reportedthat he had given instructions for the release of any remaining interneesimmediately.132. The allegations by M. Boisson have delayed the arrival at Dakar ofBritish officers to be attached to Admiral Glassford&apos;s Mission, as well as british oil officials and war correspondents. On the 23rd December information wasreceived from the Joint Staff Mission at Washington that Admiral Glassfordhad. with the full concurrence of M. Boisson, requested the immediate attachmentto his Mission of one British Naval and one British Air representative. Arrange-ments were made at once for the attachment to the Mission of the two seniorBritish Naval and Air Officers in West Africa. On the 27th December it waslearnt from Lord Swinton that the Naval and Air representatives had, on their arrival at Bathurst on their way to Dakar, received, an urgent message andletter from Admiral Glassford to postpone their visit &quot; until more propitioustime.&quot; A message has been sent from the Joint Staff Mission, Washington, to admiral Glassford saying that the British Chiefs of Staff are disturbed at thehold-up of the British Representatives. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington has also been informed of the hold-up of the British oil men.
