COMBINED OPERATIONS.1. Troops from the Combined Operations Command operating with the30th (Royal Norwegian) M.T.B. flotilla successfully attacked the importantpyrites mine on Stord Island, 40 miles south of Bergen, on the night of the23rd/24th January. The military force consisted of detachments of Nos. 10 and12 Commandos. The party was carried in four M.T.Bs. and escorted by threemore M.T.Bs.Enemy opposition was encountered during the landing of half the force onSagvaag quay, which was held by a detachment of 20 Germans with two 75-mm.guns and two A.A. guns. These guns were not manned, but fire support was brought to bear on the enemy defences as the M.T.Bs. closed) the quay. Theremainder of the force was landed unopposed on the northern side of the bay(approximately 400 yards away) and covered 2 miles to their objective at Lilleboin 25 minutes carrying approximately 50 lbs. weight of explosives each.The mine was effectively destroyed by the destruction of the hoisting andwinding gear, the jaw crusher, the transformer and compressor houses, and twoengines in the engine shed. This mine, which provided Germany with 160,000 tonsof pyrites in 1942, should be out of action for at least 12 months.At the quayside a silo, jaw crusher, conveyor belt, and the four guns and an ammunition dump were blown up by clelayecl-action fuse, and the whole quaycould be seen blazing 4 miles away as the force was returning.During the operations ashore three of the M.T.Bs. proceeded to Leirvik toattack shipping in the harbour, but no ships&apos; were seen. On the way back a2,000-ton enemy ship was set on fire and beached in a sinking condition; a watch-post was also set on fire and mines were laid. There was heavy shore gunfire,which was returned by our craft.  A Ju. 88 was shot down by M.T.Bs. 631 and 625.Casualties inflicted on enemy gun positions by M.T.Bs. cannot be assessed,but enemy casualties at Sagvaag are estimated at four or five killed and severalwounded. Three prisoners and a considerable quantity of German equipment and papers were brought back.Our casualties were : Naval. Eight   wounded.    Three   of   the   M.T.Bs.   received   minor damage.Military. One N.C.O. killed and two men slightly wounded.NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.2.   The scharnhorst and Prin-z Eugen have been sighted in the Skagerrak.There has been a decrease in U-boat activity, possibly due to bad weather.Shipping losses reported have been small.Northern Waters.3. A convoy to North Russia of 13 ships arrived safely at Kola Inlet on the27th. It was attacked by four torpedo aircraft on the 24th when 150 miles east of Bear Island.  Two of the aircraft were shot down by the escorts.M.T.Bs. 618 and 623 (Royal Norwegian Navy) shelled a target in theEosjoen area, south of Stadlandet, on the 21st.Home Waters.4. A north-bound coastal convoy was unsuccessfully attacked by E-boats offLowestoft on the night of the 24th/25th, ELM. Destroyers Mendvp and Windsorengaged and drove them off.   One E-boat was probably sunk by Windsor.ELM. Destroyer Chesterfield was damaged by underwater explosion atLondonderry on the 22nd.H.M.S. Corncrake, controlled minelayer, was severely damaged by heavyweather when 120 miles west of Bloody Foreland on the 25th, and was in distress.Search is being made.H.M.S. Newfoundland (newly completed cruiser) has joined the Fleet.Mediterranean.5. On the Allied occupation of Tripoli, the harbour entrance was foundto be completely blocked except for the passage of lighters. It is hoped to cleara passage by the 8th February for ships of 24-foot draught. Three tugs and31 lighters were found in a serviceable condition. Convoys are meanwhile using the anchorage outside.
6. On the night of the 23rd!/&apos;24th, H.M. Cruisers Cleopatra,, Euryalus, and four destroyers bombarded Zuara and fires and explosions were seen. Previouslythe port had been heavily bombed in order to delay the departure of any enemy shipping.On the 24th, M.T.Bs. 260, 264 and 315 carried out a sweep off the EastTunisian coast and shelled Monastir.A convoy to Bone, which arrived on the 22nd, was twice heavily attacked by aircraft. Four enemy aircraft were shot down, two by ships and two byBeaufighters.   One ship in the convoy was damaged.7. The following attacks have been reported by H.M. Submarines : P. 212,while on patrol in the Gulf of Genoa, sank the German U-boat 301 and a medium-sized ship and shelled the seaplane hangar at Finale Marina. P. 51 sank a2,000-ton ship off Djcrba on the 17th and the following day sank a 2,000-ton shipnorthbound from Tripoli. P. 228 attacked two ships escorted by three destroyersoff the Gulf of Naples on the 15th, one 6,000-ton ship being torpedoed and lateragain attacked and sunk. The other ship turned back. On the 19th a 2,600-ton ship was sunk, a schooner shelled and sunk, and a trawler driven ashore on theEast coast of Sardinia. P. 38 torpedoed a 8,500-ton ship in the Strait of Messinaon the 26th. This ship is believed sunk. P. 45 on various dates sank a 500-tonarmed vessel and two schooners and damaged a small ship which was beached.8. Naval Albacores torpedoed and sank a 3,500-ton ship escorted by destroyers off Cape Bon on the night 20th/21st,. and the following day attackedanother ship; the result was unknown owing to heavy A.A. fire.9.   It is estimated that during the week some 17,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft.South-West Pacific.10. U.S. M.T.Bs. attacked four Japanese barges to the south of the KumasiRiver, New Guinea, on the night of the 24th/25th. Three of the barges were destroyed and one beached.U.S. warships and aircraft bombarded the airfield at Munda and Japanese -positions on Kolumbangara Island.H.M. Australian ship Patricia Cam (naval auxiliary) was sunk in the gulf of Carpentaria on the 22nd, probably by an enemy seaplane.Burma.11. On the 25th in the Mayu River area an R J.N. patrol vessel was rammedby a Japanese coastal craft full of troops, but the R.I.N. ship disengaged herself.,opened fire and later rammedi and sank the enemy craft.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. In addition to the U-boat sunk by ELM. Submarine P. 212, a promisingattack was made on the 25th by a U.S. Boston (A.20) aircraft north of Oran.Seven other attacks have been reported, of which one, by aircraft, was offNorway and the remainder in West Atlantic waters.Enemy Intelligence.German.13. It has been reported that the Hipper is being brought south fromAltenfiord, possibly to Narvik or even farther, for temporary repairs to the damage done in the action of the 31st December. The German destroyer sunk onthat occasion is believed to have been the Friedrich Eckoldt.The Scharnhorst, Prinz Eugen and five destroyers were sighted by aircraft on the 25th off the Skaw steering west. They subsequently altered course to theeast and were not seen again.Italian.14. There is no major change in the position of enemy heavy ships, butphotographic reconnaissance of Naples on the 26th showed that the 8&quot;-cruiserpreviously sighted at Castellamare had sailed and was probably now at Spezia.The volume of traffic to Tunisian ports has been considerably lower duringthe month of January than in the two preceding months. In the past week traffichas been re-distributed and more has gone to Tunis and less to Sousse and Bizerta.[24963] B
U-Boats.15. It is estimated that there are 95 U-boats operating, half of which arein the North Atlantic on the U.S.A.-U.K supply routes.There is a concentration to the south of Greenland and Iceland (C) but,perhaps owing to the bad weather conditions, little activity has been reported.U-boats were also sighted in Northern Waters by the convoy to N. Russia,and have been active S.W. of the Azores.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 24th/25th, 665 ships have been convoyed.Of these 93 were in ocean convoys and 572 in British coastal convoys. Fifty-eight destroyers (including seven U.S. destroyers) and 69 sloops, cutters and corvettes(including five U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.During the week 53 ships in two ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 23rd totalled 352,000 tons, compared with 515.000 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 450.900 tons for the past ten weeks. Of the week&apos;imports 125,000 tons were mineral oils of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17. U-boats are reported to have attacked six ships during the week, ofwhich four are believed to have been sunk. A tanker in a homebound atlantic convoy was sunk south-east of Greenland; a Swedish ship in convoy from theUnited Kingdom to Iceland (C) was sunk west of the Faeroes; and three stragglersfrom a U.S. convoy to North Africa were torpedoed south-west of the Azores, twobeing sunk. In Australian waters a ship sailing independently was torpedoed400 miles east of Sydney.In air attacks in the Mediterranean one ship carrying war stores in an east-bound convoy was damaged off Bougie and another on Government service in awestbound convoy wras sunk off Algiers.British Minelaying&quot;.18. Aircraft laid mines off the German North Sea coast, off the biscay ports, and in the Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.19. Minelaying by enemy aircraft is suspected on four nights off the east coast, in the Thames Estuary, in the Channel between St. Albans Head andStart Point and off Dungeness.Fifty-three mines have been destroyed off the Norfolk coast. These were probably laid last week the mine totals are : 4,134 magnetic and acoustic, and 2,120 moored. -Enemy Merchant Shipping.20. Two Vichy ships under German control have recently arrived atValencia from Sete and will be used in the fruit trade from Spain to Marseilles.They are the Anjou, 504 tons, and the St. Albert (ex-Danish Betta), 1,567 tons.Three German ships, s.s. Anatolia, 2,553 tons, s.s. Lahn, 8,498 tons, ands.s. Nienburg, 3,256 tons, in Buenos Aires have been officially taken over by theArgentine Government.French Merchant Shipping in North African Ports.21. After an examination of all vessels under the control of the FrenchAfrican authorities in North and West African ports it has been agreed thatcertain of the ships are to come on charter to the Allied C-in-C. and thatothers are to be operated by the French Af thorities for the purpose of meeting the economic requirements of North and West Africa. The larger ships are to be employed in the war effort, and nine French liners, totalling 96,000 tons,and 22 cargo ships, of 172,600 tons, are to be chartered to the Allied C.-in-C.for this purpose. Seven passenger ships of 30,000 tons are to operate under the control of the French African authorities, as well as 51 smaller ships,
of a total of 168,000 tons, many of which are at present reported to be unsea-wortlvv. The services to and from ports in North and West Africa will bemaintained only by French ships.Intelligence.Russian.22. Of the six submarines which have been on passage from north-easternSiberia and the Pacific to North Russia via America, one has been lost, threeare now at Rosyth, one is in Iceland and one is on passage to north Russia.The Russian Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Black Sea has moved his headquarters north to Tuapse.In the Sea of Azov there is ice for a distance of 7 miles around the coast and covering the Gulf of Taganrog. There is considerable drift ice in the straits of Kerch.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resume asan inset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.23. The Russians are attacking in strength south of Schlusselburg in anattempt to widen their corridor to Leningrad along the southern shore of lake ladoga.Central Sector.24.   In the Velikie Luki area fighting has died down.Upper Don Sector.25. The Germans announced on the 25th that they had voluntarilyevacuated their bridgehead on the eastern bend of the Don at Voronezh.The Russians, continuing their offensive operations south-west of Svoboda, have captured the whole length of the railway running south-eastward from Valuikithrough Starobjelsk to its junction with the Millerovo-Voroshilovgrad line.Stalingrad Sector.26. Heavy Russian attacks from the west and the south-west have driventhe encircled German Sixth Army into an extremely restricted area. Itsprivations are reported to be very great, and its elimination appears to be at hand.Don Sector.27. The Russian offensive is meeting with increased German opposition and the major territorial gain is south-east of Rostov. North-north-east ofRostov the Russians retain their hold on their bridgehead over the Donets atKamensk, despite powerful German counter-attacks. East of Rostov, in thearea between the Don and the Manich, the Germans appear to be delivering astrong counter-attack, but the Russians are resisting very stubbornly. South-south-east of Rostov the Russian advance astride the railway Stalingrad-Krasnodar has now reached to within some 40 miles of the important junctionof Tikhoretsk.Caucasus Sector.28. The Russians continue their pursuit of the German forces retiringnorth-westward astride the railway Mineralnie Vodi-Rostov and have takenArmavir, the junction for the only branch line to Maikop and Tuapse.Summary.29. Though the Russian threat to Rostov has become serious, the germans are likely to make a supreme effort to hold this area and still dispose of superiorcommunications.The Russians will only gain full control of the two railways radiating fromStalingrad westwards to Likhaya, and south-westward to Tikhoretsk, when the[24963] b 2
German Sixth Army in the Stalingrad area has been finally destroyed. In theCaucasus the Germans are being hard pressed, but the mild winter conditionsare hampering Russian operations. The rivers are only incompletely frozen and provide serious obstacles. It would be extremely difficult for the Germans to evacuate Northern Caucasia by the Kerch Strait. The capacity of the ports is small and the beaches are unsuitable for embarkation purposes. There is nobridge across the Strait and, in view of the strong currents, the construction of even a pontoon bridge is impossible. Further, a freezing of the Strait to a degree which would permit the passage of guns or tanks is a very rare occurrence,though it took place last year. It is considered, therefore, that all heavy equipment would have to be abandoned, though personnel might escape in small boats.The Russian successes in the Southern Sector have been very impressive, butthe)r have been achieved at considerable cost and it would, therefore, be dangerous to consider the Germans as beaten or demoralised.Libya,30. Since the beginning of last week the enemy has continued his movementwestward, and has succeeded in withdrawing the bulk of his forces to the area ofthe Tunisian frontier.On the 21st, one of our armoured formations forced a passage through thedefiles north of Tarhuna and reached a point 15 miles south of Castel Benito bymidday of the 22nd. Another formation made, a sweep to the south-west ofAzizia. and on the 23rd were 15 miles south of Zauia.Road demolitions made the advance in the north slow and difficult, but by the22nd Castel Verdi was occupied, and on the 23rd our forces entered Tripoli.Following up the withdrawal of the enemy, Zauia wras occupied on the 25th. and leading elements of our forces occupied Sabratha on the 27th and by last light had reached points about 60 miles west of Tripoli and further south a point on theZuara-Nalut road, 45 miles south-west of Zuara.31. The population of Tripoli is quiet and destruction in the city has notbeen on a large scale, although harbour installations have been thoroughlydemolished. Horns was captured undamaged and a few lighters and small craft were found in serviceable condition.   Petrol is now being landed at Bouerat.Tunisia.32. Following the engagements recorded in last week&apos;s Resume, the Frenchregrouped their forces south-west of Robaa, and were reinforced by Britisharmoured detachments from First Army. Further reinforcements which arrived on the 21st set about clearing the roads leading east and north-east of Robaa.An enemy attack directed south-west towards Ousseltia almost reached theOusseltia-Kairouan road at the end of the valley before it was turned back onthe 21st. A U.S. force with tanks moved up from the south and began to exercisepressure against the enemy from the eastern side of the valley. The enemyadvance was halted and U.S. troops now hold the high ground to the south of theroad Ousseltia-Kairouan. The enemy still hold the high ground to the north ofthis road.Further north the only activity has been round Bou Arada, where the openground north of the village has changed hands frequently.In Southern Tunisia a successful U.S. raid into the Maknassy area on the24th cost the enemy about 200 casualties, including 150 prisoners. U.S. casualties were negligible.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.33. Organised resistance ceased in the Sanananda area on the 22nd. Duringthe last two weeks 800 Japanese have been killed and more than 120 taken prisonerin this area.Solomons.34. U.S. troops captured Kokumbona, on the north coast of Guadalcanal,about 15 miles west of Lunga on the 24th, killing about 290 Japanese.
Intelligence. france.35. There have been further departures of German divisions from France toRussia, and also a slight intake of divisions into France. The number of divisions in France and the Low Countries is now estimated to be 34.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36.   U.S. heavy bombers, unescorted, attacked Wilhelmshaven.Mosquitos made a low-level daylight attack on engine works at Copenhagen.Bomber Command aircraft made heavy attacks on Lorient, Dusseldorf andEssen.Considerable damage was caused to enemy transport columns withdrawing from Libya.   Ports and airfields in Tunisia were bombed by Allied aircraft.Succesful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.United Kingdom.37. Enemy activity was on a small scale. In daylight 22 enemy aircraft,the majority of which were fighter bombers, were reported overland, and at nightthe corresponding total was 28.   Three enemy aircraft were shot down.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.38. During the week strong forces of U.S. heavy bombers attackedWilhelmshaven and Lorient. Ninety-one aircraft were despatched againstWilhelmshaven, of which fifty-three attacked from about 24,000 feet, dropping118 tons of bombs. Cloud conditions made results difficult to observe, but hits were seen in the Bauhafen and adjacent areas, and the bombing is believed to havebeen good. Some of the remaining aircraft attacked Emden, but the majority,owing to uncertain and deteriorating visibility, were unable to identify the target.One Ebrtress (B. 17) and two Liberators (B. 24) are missing. Ninety U.S. bombers were despatched against Keroman (Lorient) submarine base. Thirty-one air-craft attacked in good visibility fixxm 24,000 feet, bursts were seen directly on the target and adjacent buildings; photographs taken the same day show muchdestruction and severe damasre. A further 17 bombers attacked Brest as an alter-native target.   Five Fortresses (B. 17) are missing.Nine Mosquitoes were despatched to make a low-level attack on the Burmeisterand Wain Diesel Engine Works at Copenhagen. Eight aircraft attacked,dropping 33 x 500 lb. bombs from 50 to 150 feet; hits were observed on test shops.Accurate light flak was encountered in the target area and one Mosquito was seen to crash and explode, and another crashed on return; the remainder landedsafely.Twenty-nine Bostons (A. 20) and 24 Venturas (B. 34) of Bomber Commandsuccessfully attacked five airfields in occupied France. Two attacks, each by12 Bostons (A. 20), were directed against the port area at Flushing, and12 Mitchells (B. 25) bombed the Canal Oil Installations at Ghent/Terneuzen;escort for this latter operation was provided by 16 Mustangs, four of which are missing, one enemy fighter being destroyed. Other targets attacked by our bombers were in the Osnabruck area, at Esens and the engine sheds at Bruges.Fighter escorts were provided for most of these operations; during the attack onthe airfield at St. Omer six enemy fighters were shot down; a total of six bombersare missing from all these operations.Targets in France and Belgium were attacked by aircraft of Fighter and army Co-operation Commands, operations being chiefly directed against railways.Whirlwinds successfully bombed and machine-gunned a variety of objectives,including 12 locomotives and goods trains, rolling stock, lorries and a 3,000-ton ship off Dunkirk. Spitfires and Typhoons damaged a further number oflocomotives, one of which was seen to explode; goods trains and gun positionswere also attacked. During one sweep by 12 Mustangs in the Havre/Rouen areas large number of targets was successfully attacked, including 24 locomotives,rolling stock, signal boxes, lorries, three large tugs and about 100 troops. Duringanother sweep by Mustangs, seven locomotives were damaged in the Dol/Rennesarea.   From these operations three aircraft are missing.
Night. ,39. Strong forces of bombers were sent out on five nights during the weekagainst Lorient, Dusseldorf and Essen.Two attacks were made on Lorient. For the first, when 116 bombers were despatched following the day attack by U.S. bombers. Visibility was good and109 aircraft attacked; a large number of fires was reported well concentrated in the town and docks. A particularly large fire was seen in the south of thetown and a very big explosion was noted towards the end of the attack.Photographs taken during the following clay show buildings near the docks tobe devastated and fires still burning in the main workshops of the Lorientshipbuilding yard. For the second attack, 156 bombers were despatched; theconditions were not so favourable but 122 aircraft attacked. Fires were reportedscattered over a considerable area, but some large fires were observed in thecentre of the town and in the dock area. During these two operations nearly500 tons of bombs were dropped; four bombers are missing.Two blind bombing attacks were made on Dusselclorf, 83 bombers being sent out on the first and 162 on the second. Both these operations were carried outin 10/10th cloud, but flares and marker bombs, especially during the second attack, are reported to have been accurately placed and a large concentration of bombs was dropped on or around these markers. In the second operation themain attack was completed in 23 minutes, most aircraft attacking within a periodof 10/15 minutes. Flak was intense and very accurate but searchlights wereineffective through the clouds. During these two attacks about 600 tons of bombs were dropped, including five of 8,000 lbs. and 148 of 4,000 lbs.; eightbombers are missing. Eighty-two aircraft were despatched to carry out a similarblind bombing attack on Essen, when about 180 tons of bombs, including 49 of4,000 lbs. were dropped. Heavy and accurate flak was encountered; four bombersare missing.Propaganda leaflets were dropped by 22 bombers over France. Of 25 bombersdespatched to attack shipping in the River Gironcle 18 aircraft bombed the dock-area at Bordeaux.Coastal Operations.40. One of three Hampdens, escorted by four Beaufighters, on patrol offSouth-West Norway, torpedoed a ship of 2,000 tons; owing to bad visibility nofurther results could be observed.In the afternoon of the 25th, a force of 23 torpedo-carrying Hampdensescorted by 17 Beaufighters was desptitched to attack the Scharnhorst and PrinzEugen, sighted earlier in the day by a Mosquito off Kristiansand. No shippingwas sighted; one Harnpden is missing.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 139 were despatched, laid 343 sea-mines in enemy waters.   Seven aircraft are missing from these operations.Mediterranean.French North Africa.41. Bizerta harbour was bombed heavily by clay and night. On the 23rd atotal of 35 U.S. Fortresses (B. 17), made two separate attacks on the naval base and shipping. One large ship was sunk and hits were obtained on another;bursts also were seen on oil cisterns, workshops and hangars. A strong force of enemy fighters intercepted the second formation of Fortresses (B. 17) andaltogether about 30 enemy aircraft were destroyed and others damaged. At nightnearly 40 tons of bombs were dropped by Wellingtons and very satisfactory results were reported. Six U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) also bombed Sousse and hitone ship.A heavy day attack by 70 escorted U.S. bombers was made on El Aouina(Tunis) airfield and many fires were observed among aircraft on the ground.During the operation nine enemy aircraft were shot down and one U.S. bomber and two fighters are missing.In Central Tunisia support was provided for Allied land forces, and enemylines of communication east of Pont clu Fahs and Kairouan were attacked. at night Bisleys and in daylight U.S. Mitchells (B. 25) and Hurricane bombers were employed, and road and railway junctions and enemy vehicles wereeffectively bombed.In Southern Tunisia attacks were concentrated on enemy M.T. betweenGabes and Ben Gardane, as a result of which numerous vehicles were damaged.
In their attacks on the 21st and 23rd U.S. Lightnings (P. 38) report thedestruction of 65 and 28 vehicles respectively. At night a force of Bostons (A. 20)and Baltimores (A. 30) from Libya dropped nearly 20 tons of bombs on enemyM.T. west of Ben Gardane.The landing grounds at Ben Gardane and Medenine were attacked day and.night by bombers and fighter-bombers based on Libya, and many fires were reported. Further attacks were made by Wellingtons and U.S. bombers fromTunisia on the 24th. A raid was made on Medenine West by 18 U.S. Mitchells(B. 25) who claimed the destruction on the ground of 25 to 30 enemy aircraft.Enemy bomber and torpedo aircraft were active against our shippingconvoys and our night fighters shot down 11 enemy aircraft. Otherwise enemy activity was mainly defensive in response to heavy Allied, attack on ports, airfields and communications.The whole of the German Libyan air force is now considered to be based in southern Tunisia.Libya.42. Allied fighter-bombers and. light-bombers operated on a large scale and maintained constant pressure by day and night on the retreating Axis columns.Forward landing grounds were occupied and utilised, as our ground forcesadvanced.   Offensive patrols were maintained over the forward area.Great damage was inflicted on excellent targets on the road between Zuaraand Ben Gardane. On the 22nd, a formation of fighter-bombers surprised a convoy refuelling from a petrol tanker, and destroyed 20 vehicles and damagedmany others, including five staff cars. Two days later Kittyhawks (P. 40)destroyed or damaged 36 vehicles in the same area. Pressure was reducedlater in the week owing to the fast withdrawal and thinning out of the enemy&apos;smotorisecl columns.On the 21st, two heavy attacks were made on Castel Benito airfield; manyaircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground and three ploughs which wereploughing up the surface were also destroyed. On the 24th Spitfires patrolled the airfield to cover the arrival of our transport aircraft.Special attention was paid to the harbour at Zuara. On the 22nd, an attack was made by 56 Kittyhawks (P. 40) in order to delay the departure of enemy ships prior to bombardment by a naval force. Hits were made on a ship,on the jetty and on wharves; lighters and a U-boat were machine-gunned;20 M.T. vehicles in the vicinity were destroyed or damaged and three M.E. 109swere shot down. Attacks were continued on four subsequent days with theobject of hampering the unloading of barges; damage was caused to a ship, to awarehouse and to transport vehicles.Our ground forces were not seriously opposed by enemy air attacks.German fighters which probably had sustained heavy losses as a result of ourintensive attacks were employed in protection of the Panzer Army. During the.week 14 enemy aircraft were shot down and our losses were nine aircraft.Southern Italy, Sicily and Mediterranean.43. Offensive reconnaissances against enemy shipping were fully maintained by Allied aircraft.

Intruder operations over Sicily by Mosquitos and Spitfires carrying bombs were on an increased scale. The attacks were primarily against railways and communications; a number of trains Avas successfully attacked and at least16 locomotives destroyed or damaged. Small concentrated attacks were also made on a chemical factory at Licata, on the power station at Porto Empedocleand on the airfields at Gela and Lampedusa.U.S. Liberators (B. 24) carried out raids on Palermo Harbour, and onMessina. avhere bombs burst near the main ferry terminus and in the area ofnaaml fuel cisterns.India and Burma.44.. Allied offensive efforts have been directed mainly against enemy positions, airfields and communications, and in support of our ground troopsin Arakan.Enemy positions at Lungchaung were bombed by 17 Blenheims, and villagesin the area were attacked by an equal number of Hurricanes. Another importantattack avas made by 14 escorted Blenheims against Japanese forward positions at Donbaik. A westbound enemy mechanised column was attacked by 12 Hurri-canes in the Taungup/Yebawgyi area; another similar attack was carried outon enemy vehicles on the Taungup/Padaung road.Several attacks were made on Prome. the railway station, a factory and warehouses, river craft and the airfield being the main objectives. Other airfieldsto be attacked aa^ere at Magwe, Slnvebo, Toungoo and Heho, the last being-attacked by 10 Wellingtons and four Liberators (B. 24). Sixteen U.S. Liberators(B. 24) made two attacks on clocks and shipping at Rangoon, where a 6,000-ton ship avas hit. TJ.S. Mitchells (B. 25) bombed railway rolling-stock at Mandalayand KittyhaAvd^s (P. 40) attacked locomotives at Naba. Allied bombers attackedriver steamers north of Danson Bay and small craft in the Singaung area.Enemy bombers made several attacks on Chittagong, and &quot;the airfield atPanargarh (88 miles N.W. of Calcutta) was also attacked.
