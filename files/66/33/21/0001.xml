His DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVERNMENTSECRET uCOPY NO.   O VW.P.(U3)21January 13 th, 19^-3.WAR CABINET,SOCIAL SECURITY. Bate &quot;by the Minister of Production.The Beveridge Scheme for Social Security conceives of theproblem almost entirely as one of insurance.    It accepts as inevitable a considerable degree of instability in our economic system, and proceeds to ask how people may &quot;be protected financially(against the accidents of unemployment and sickness,  no less thanagainst the hardships of old age,    So far as the financial &quot;basisIf the scheme is concerned,  much must obviously depend on thelecuracy of the estimate of the post-war course of employment madein the report, which assumes an average level of unemployment ofsome 10% of the working population at present insured under thegeneral scheme,  a figure somewhat lower than that which we&quot;experienced in the years immediately &quot;before the war.But in ail this I feel that there lies a paradox,  namely inthe notion that the specific for all ills is a system of insurance.It is true that such a system exercises to some extent a stabilisingEffect, since it helps to maintain purchasing power in times of depression by dissipating the surplus which is built up in theloom- periods.    As Sir William himself,  however, recognizes,  otherJjeasurGS will also be needed,  and no system of insurance can hopeso succeed unless we can avoid periods of mass unemployment withgll the economic loss and social discontent which they inevitablydause.I feel, therefore,  that the Beveridge Report gives a-necessarily incomplete approach to the question of social security.It does not touch the essential problem of creating the backgroundW reasonable stability which any such scheme requires for its success.    I should like to have Sir William&apos;s views on the whole problem of dealing with violent fluctuations of trade,  and of removing maladjustments of employment after the war.    I know thatM great deal of valuable- work is already being done on thesequestions under the auspices of the Committee on reconstruction problems, but I suggest that Sir William should now be associatedwith this work,   in order that his recent report may be given its proper setting.(Signed)    O.L.Ministry of Production,weat George Street,  S.W.1.
