THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 14. ^January 8, 1943.WAR CABINET.INTERDEPARTMENTAL   COMMITTEE   ON  lighting restrictions.Interim Report.AT their meeting on the 14th December the War Cabinet decided that, inview of our long immunity from air attack, the Committee which reviewed theblackout regulations in the autumn of 1941 should be re-convened to consider thepossibility of further relaxation of the present lighting restrictions. We were asked to bear in mind the effect of any such relaxation on fuel consumption(W.M. (42), 168th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. We have assumed that the War Cabinefs main object was to find somepracticable relaxations which would bring immediate advantages from the pointof view of increasing our productive efficiency and maintaining national morale.We have, therefore, concentrated in the first instance on measures which could give some practical relief before the end of the present winter. In this InterimReport we put forward final recommendations for improvements in respect ofrailway lighting, and the lighting of public service vehicles, which could bebrought into operation in a comparatively short time; and we seek further direc-tions as to the lines on which enquiries should be pursued into the modification of street lighting, which could not be substantially improved before next winter.Industrial Lighting.3. During the course of 1942 various relaxations of the lighting restrictionshave already been authorised with a view to facilitating night work in various industries, &amp;c, engaged in war production. The following are only examples ofthe numerous relaxations already made :  The higher standards of lighting for shipbuilding and ship-repairing whichin 1941 were restricted to shipyards on the West Coast have been extended to mostof the important yards on the North-East Coast.Special lighting schemes have been devised to enable work to continue at night on the construction of tank-landing craft at more than 100 factories invarious parts of the country.Special arrangements have been made for the lighting of night work on aero-dromes and other important building sites.Special lighting arrangements have been authorised at inland sorting depots.The regulations governing the lighting of agricultural tractors have been modified to facilitate night ploughing.4. We do not suggest any general relaxation of the standards of industriallighting. We. recommend, however, that the Ministry of Home Security shouldcontinue to give sympathetic consideration to individual applications for speciallighting to facilitate particular industrial processes and services.f24887] b
Railway Lighting.5. The Railway Lighting Committee have reviewed the present arrange-ments for the lighting of railway premises and the interior lighting of trains andhave submitted a number of detailed recommendations which meet with ourapproval. We do not think it necessary to burden the War Cabinet with thedetails : the substance of the recommendations is as follows :  6. Railway Stations. -Where a higher standard of lighting (-2 foot-candles)has been authorised for the handling of mails and parcels it will in future be available for the benefit of passenger traffic, provided that special arrangements are made to ensure that it is used only when, and in places where, it is requiredfor mails, parcels or passenger traffic.The number of stations at which this lighting is available may be extended.The possibility of up-grading the standard of lighting at less importantstations throughout the country will also be reviewed. No higher lighting will,however, be ailoAved in stations within 12 miles of the South and East Coasts.7. Proposals for increased lighting in marshalling yards are under review.Individual applications for special external lighting at additional points,eg., coaling plants, water cranes, &amp;c, will be considered.8. Interior Lighting of Trains. Various methods have been devised for improving the standard of interior lighting in trains. The modifications proposedvary with different types of rolling-stock; the general aim is, however, to raisethe lighting standard to a point at which the traveller can read with comfort.The means adopted to reach this standard vary considerably in detail; but. afterinspection of a number of different coaches, the Committee are satisfied that thevarious adaptations proposed will add materially to the comfort of passengers.These adjustments are so designed that, while the standard of interiorlighting is raised, the increase in the spill of light outside the coach and theadditional risk from the point of view of visibility from the air are not more than can be accepted while the present lull in raiding continues This lighting will, ofcourse, be extinguished on an air-raid warning.9. The various modifications proposed can be carried out in a comparatively short time and at a small cost in terms of labour and materials. The originalstandard of lighting could be speedily restored if heavy raiding were resumed.The Committee recommend that the railway companies be authorised to begin work at once on the adaptation of existing fittings.Interior Lighting of Public Service Vehicles.10. At the request of the Committee, the London Passenger transport board have devised an improved system of interior lighting for buses, trams andtrolley-buses. The object is to provide a standard of lighting which will enablepassengers to read with reasonable comfort during periods when no air raid isin progress. This has been achieved by increasing the number, or modifying theshades, of internal lights in these vehicles, while providing a switch which enables the number lighted to be reduced to not more than three on an air-raid warning.The precise standard of lighting to be allowed during an air-raid warning, andin certain special conditions, will be settled by the Ministry of Home security and the Ministry of War Transport.11. The Committee recommend that the regulations governing the interiorlighting of public service vehicles be so amended as to allow of the installation of this improved lighting throughout the country, provided that -(a) such increased lighting is not used within 12 miles of the South and EastCoasts;(b) in all parts of the country interior lighting is reduced, during an air-raid warning, to not more than three lights.12. If the existing regulations are so relaxed, the Ministry of war transport do not contemplate any great difficulty in securing general compliance with the new standard on the part of undertakings operating public servicevehicles in all parts of the country. It is thought likely that, on the whole, under-takings will be anxious to take advantage of the higher standards permitted.13. The adaptations involved in bringing vehicles up to this higher standardwill not entail any considerable increase in fuel consumption or any substantialexpenditure of labour or materials.
Street Lighting.14. The standard of street lighting could not be appreciably improvedwithout considerable modification of the existing installations. Even if decisions were taken and work put in hand at once, the necessary adaptations could not becarried out in time to bring any practical benefit to the public before the end ofthe present winter. As regards street lighting, therefore, the question is whatstandard should we aim at providing for next winter. Out of many possibilitieswe select, for consideration by the War Cabinet, two alternatives :- (a) The installation of a dual system of lighting in the centres of towns and subsidiary shopping centres so that, in addition to the present star-lighting, which would remain alight during air-raids, there would bea higher level of lighting centrally controlled, which could be turnedoff on an air-raid warning. This plan was described in the Reportof the Rucker Committee submitted to the War Cabinet in September1940 (W.P. (40) 375).(b) The raising of the existing star-lighting from the present standard, of-00025 foot-candles to 002 foot-candles; and the extension of thislighting to areas in which it has not hitherto been installed. this could not be extinguished during air-raids.15. The Dual System. The great advantage of this system is that, as itwould be designed to be extinguished on an air-raid warning a much higherintensity of light could be allowed. The Rucker Committee contemplated a standard of -02 foot-candles, which would correspond to the standard of peace-time lighting in side streets.The main disadvantage of this alternative, in present circumstances, is thehigh cost of installation and maintenance in terms of labour and materials. some additional fuel consumption would also be involved.The Rucker Committee estimated that a total of 120,000 fittings would berequired to equip a dual system in the shopping and amusement centres of theprincipal towns; and they put the probable cost at  500,000. This figure would now have to be increased to at least  750,000.The previous estimate was based on the assumption that 90,000 of the newfittings would be electric and 30,000 gas. It now seems probable that, if sucha system were introduced, all the installations would be electric. On theassumption of 120,000 electric fittings, the additional coal consumption wouldbe about 8,000 tons a year. The cost of installation, in terms of labour and materials would be more substantial. The provision of 120,000 electric fittingswould involve :  Sheet iron...BrassIron brackets- Sundry brass partsInsulated wireCopperMan-hours Manufacture..........       ......   120,000Erection      ............      ...      ... 4,000,00016. Some of the materials required for the installation of such a system arenow in very short supply. This applies particularly to the large quantities of rubber and copper required for cables and insulated wire.The War Cabinet may feel that in present circumstances this solution isruled out by reason of its heavy cost in terms of labour and materials.17. Increased Standard of Star-lighting. The alternative is to raise thestandard of the existing star-lighting and, as an additional possibility, to extend its installation to areas where there is at present no street lighting at all.We have made tests of various higher standards : -002 foot-candles (eight times the present intensity);-005 foot-candles (twenty times the present intensity);-01 foot-candles (forty times the present intensity).We are satisfied that, if the standard were raised to -002 foot-candles, therewould be substantial practical benefit to pedestrians. The existing star-lightinggives only a small amount of light in the streets : its main advantage is that itgives a sense of direction.   Lighting at -002 foot-candles producing a definitef24887] b 264 tons.13 tons.80 tons.27 tons.6,000 miles.240 tons.
sensation of light, enables obstacles to be seen sufficiently clearly, and makes it possible to walk with reasonable comfort and security.We believe that this sense of greater comfort and safety could be secured by lighting somewhat lower than -002 foot-candles. Experience shows, however,that, owing to wear and tear, accumulation of dirt, &amp;c, the standard of lightquickly deteriorates to about two-thirds of the standard when originally installed.If, therefore, any change is to be made, the new specifications should provide for a standard of -002 foot-candles. Within two or three months of installation,fittings designed to provide this standard will normally give a level of light not much above -0014 foot-candles.If heavy raiding were resumed, fittings adapted for an intensity of-002 foot-candles could, without much difficulty, be readjusted to the old level of-00025. If need be, street lighting could be extinguished altogether for a fewdays until the necessary adjustments had been made.18. For the towns which already have star-lighting installed, the cost ofadaptation to a standard of -002 foot-candles would not be large, and would not involve the use of more than 20 tons of material.The change would not involve any additional fuel consumption.19. The cost of extending star-lighting to areas which have not installed itat all would be more substantial. In many of the Metropolitan Boroughs, andin many towns outside London, star-lighting has not been installed. Of a totalof about 750,000 lighting points which could appropriately be fitted for this typeof lighting, only about 300,000 have so far been fitted; and the cost of equippingthe remaining 450,000 with star-lighting giving a standard of -002 foot-candlesis estimated as follows :  Sheet iron ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 449 tons.Brass and zinc    ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 180 tons.Man-hours for manufacture    ...       ...       ...       1,125,000Renewals Gas mantles       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 900,000 per annum.Electric bulbs     ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 900,000 per annum.(A new star-light fitting for gas lamps has recently been designed, which ismuch more economical of materials than previous models. If arrangements could be made for the mass-production of this new fitting, the quantities ofmaterials required would be substantially lower.)The man-hours required for the maintenance of these lighting points are estimated at 2,700.000 per annum; but it is not possible to say how far thiswould be additional to the staff already employed for the maintenance of lightsalreadv in use.20. If 450,000 additional lamps were brought into use, it is estimated thatthe total additional expenditure of coal might be Tons *per annum.Gas.....................       225,000Electricity      ..................        10,000Total ............       235,000The new gas fitting burns little more than one-third of the gas consumed by existing fittings. If, therefore, this new fitting could be generally installed, theadditional coal consumption would be reduced to about 89,000 tons per annum.21. The advantages of increasing the standard of street lighting and extending its use are obvious and need no elaboration.The main disadvantages may be summarised as follows :  (a) Lighting of 002 foot-candles could not be switched out on a warning.The risk that street lighting would provide navigational aid for enemy aircraft would therefore be increased.The laboratory calculations for the maximum visibility of the existingstar-lighting (-00025 foot-canclles) from immediately overhead under the most favourable conditions are Dry. Wet.Streets invisible ...       above 10,000 ft.      above 4,000 ft.Streets unidentifiable ...       above 7,000 ft.      above 2,000 ft.
The same calculations for street lighting at -002 foot-candles give the followingresult: Dry. Wet.Streets invisible ... above 25,000 ft. above 13,000 ft.Streets unidentifiable...      above 17,000 ft.      above 7,000 ft.When tests were carried out in 1939 to establish a suitable standard of street lighting, observation from the air showed that streets lighted to an intensity of-002 foot-candles were visible from the air at a height of 10,000-12.000 feet froma distance of 5-6 miles. When the streets were wet they were visible at the sameheights from a distance of 2-3 miles.The Air Staffs representative on the Committee took the view that street lighting of this higher intensity would go some way to stultify the purpose of theblackout, which is to render accurate navigation and target identification difficultat night. He considered that the cumulative affect of large quantities of thislighting would be to render the areas in which it was used visible from the air,thus inviting attack and assisting enemy navigation. Further, he pointed outthat the use of such lighting would decrease the value of decoys, which are dependent for their effectiveness upon a complete black-out of the targets whichthey protect.The Air Staff think it unlikely that the present scale of air attack against this country will be materially increased during 1943, unless there is some important development in the strategic situation. Nevertheless, the enemy airforces still available for attack on this country are sufficient to enable them to deliver at any time sharp raids by some 60-70 aircraft on three or four nights in succession; and by conserving his effort the enemy could deliver concentratedattacks of 150 or more aircraft at infrequent intervals. Finally, enemy bases are sufficiently close to England to enable such a number of aircraft to make two&apos;sorties in one night against targets in almost any part of the country.Thus, although it may be safe to assume that apart from any majorstrategical change, of which we could expect to receive warning continuousheavy raiding is impracticable during 1943, the fact remains that during thislull sharp attacks could be directed against particular targets, and no one canpredict which towns might be selected for such attacks. If, by increasing the intensity Of street lighting, we made it easier for enemy bombers to find theirtargets, it would be small consolation for a town selected for attack to know that other towns had derived nothing but benefit from their increased lighting.(&amp;) A large proportion of local authorities have in the past been unwilling to install star-lighting. Their reluctance has been based partly on expense andpartly on security.As regards expense, some authorities who previously felt that the cost wasnot worth the small amount of light permitted might take a different view if the authorised standard were raised to - 002 foot-candles. There are, however,indications that a good many local authorities would still be reluctant to incur the expense of installing any form of modified street lighting which could be permitted under war conditions.As regards security, local authorities are necessarily influenced by local opinion which in many areas (particularly those which have suffered severelyfrom bombing) is strongly against any increase in lighting while there remainsany danger of air attack. There are indications that these local authorities wouldnot be willing to install a higher standard of street lighting unless it could beauthoritatively stated on behalf of the Government that the installation of suchlighting would not increase the risks of air attack. Having regard to the viewsof the Air Staff, no such assurance could be given.It seems probable therefore that, at the present time, a substantial numberof local authorities would decline to take advantage of a higher authorisedstandard of street lighting. If the present lull in raiding should continue untilthe summer, and the general war situation should continue to improve, it ispossible that local authorities might then be induced to take a different view ofthe situation possibly in time to permit of the extended installation of this newlighting before next winter. It seems likely, however, that there would still be difficulty in securing uniformity of practice among local authorities generally.(c) One disadvantage of this lack of uniformity would be the difficulty ofknowing in advance what quantity of the new fittings would be required. Itwould be almost impossible to arrange for the production of these new fittingsunless a firm order could be given at trie outset. And, unless it were known what proportion of local authorities would take advantage of the higher standard,production of the new fittings could not in practice be arranged.
(d) This local option by local authorities also gives rise to special difficultyin London and other aggregations of urban areas controlled by a number ofdifferent authorities, e.g., in Lancashire and round Birmingham. There would beobvious difficulties in installing lighting at -002 foot-candles in some parts of such areas and not in others. Apart from the &quot; patchiness &quot; when seen from the airthere would be difficulty and danger on the ground when passing from a lighted toan unlightecl area. We have reason to believe that Metropolitan Boroughs whichhave installed star-lighting would, be unwilling to increase its intensity to-002 foot-candles unless they were assured that adjacent boroughs would followsuit; and it seems likely that this attitude would also be adopted in similar areasoutside London.22. If, therefore, the War Cabinet favoured in principle the raising of thestandard of street lighting to -002 foot-candles, it would be expedient that, before any final decision was taken, consultations should be held with some representa-tive local authorities to ascertain what likelihood there was of securing a uniformpractice in this matter throughout the country.At this stage, therefore, we ask for further directions from the War Cabineton the following points : (a) Should the alternative of a dual system be further pursued, in view of itscost in terms of labour and materials ?(b) If this first alternative is rejected, should further enquiries be pursuedinto the possibility of (i) raising the existing star-lighting to a standard of -002 foot-candles; (ii) securing the installation of star-lighting up to that standard in those Metropolitan Boroughs, and inthose parts of aggregations of urban areas outside London wherethere is at present no street lighting at all; and (iii), in addition,securing the installation of star-lighting at a standard of 002 foot-candles in all towns outside London (other than coastal areas) where no star-lighting has hitherto been installed?Summary of Recommendations.23.   We append the following summary of our recommendations :  Industrial lighting. No general relaxation of standards; but sympathetic consideration &quot;will continue to be given to individual applications for speciallighting to facilitate particular industrial processes and services (para-graphs 3-4).Railway lighting. Detailed improvements in the lighting of railway stations(paragraph 6).Special lighting to be authorised at particular points to facilitate railwayworking (paragraph 7).Interior lighting in trains to be brought to a level permitting passengers to read with comfort (paragraph 8).Public service vehicles. Interior lighting in buses, trams and trolley-busesto be raised to a standard enabling passengers in all parts of the vehicle to readwith comfort. This additional lighting not to be permitted within 12 miles of theSouth and East Coasts; and, in all parts of the country, to be extinguished on an air-raid &quot;warning (paragraphs 10 and 11).Street lighting. Further directions are sought on two points : (a) Is further consideration of a dual system of street lighting to be ruled out in view of the substantial cost (in terms of labour and materials) ofinstallation and maintenance? (paragraph 22).(&amp;) If so, should enquiries be pursued into the possibility of (i) raising to-002 foot-candles the standard of the star-lighting already installed;(ii) arranging for its installation throughout the London area and similar aggregations of urban areas; (iii) in addition, installing star-lighting at a standard of -002 foot-candles in all towns outside London(other than coastal areas) where no star-lighting has hitherto beeninstalled? (paragraph 22).Signed on behalf of the Committee :HARCOURT JOHNSTON K.January 8, 1943.
