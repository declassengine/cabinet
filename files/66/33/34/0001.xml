PART I. ALLIED NAVAL CONTINGENTS.Notes on the various Allied Navies.General.. VISITS by the Allied Admirals and staffs were arranged during the quarterto the Fighter Command, Cambridge University and the Sopworth AviationWorks.2. Most of the Allied Navies have been keen on training some of their young officers at Dartmouth. For the next term at the R.N. College there will be20 Norwegian, 10 Dutch, 4 Greek and 2 French Cadets.Free French Navy.: 3. From various reports received it is quite clear, that recent events havegiven a big impetus to keenness in the Free French Navy and have raised morale and efficiency in a surprising manner. There is-no doubt that all these Frenchmenare anti-Nazi, but many of them are not necessarily strongly pro-British,although there are undoubtedly a large number who have very friendly relationswith the British Navy. It must be remembered that, unlike many of the other allies, Frenchmen can only think of their own country and give little thought toa &quot; brighter and better world&quot; generally. It is also a fact that, a number ofofficers are not impressed with the idea of fighting for democracy. This, perhaps,is not surprising in view of the results of democracy as applied in their country.Our collaboration with Darlan undoubtedly raised a great deal of suspicionin the Free French Navy, and although no doubt the majority of Frenchmenrealise that the United States was responsible for this collaboration, the Britishdid not escape a good deal of suspicion. One reaction has been an increase Ofloyalty to de Gaulle, but it is too early to say whether this will be lasting orwhether, if de Gaulle does not co-operate with Giraud, Free French sailors maynot be drawn towards the French Navy in Africa.4. It may be said generally that efficiency is patchy, but on the whole satis-factory. The high-spot is to be found in the Free French submarines, reportsabout which are excellent.Successes.5. The submarine Junon torpedoed a merchant ship in Norwegian waterson the 18th October and another one on the 19th.Ships Commissioned.6. The 23rd M..T.B. Flotilla, based, on Dartmouth, the &quot;Hunt&quot; Classdestroyer La Combattante and three Chasseurs, previously manned by the British.The whole Chasseur Flotilla at Cowes is now French manned.Ships to be Commissioned.7.   The &quot; Hunt &quot; Class destroyer Stevenstone and submarine P. 67.Ships turned over to the Royal Navy.8. The French have lent the destroyer Ouragan and the Torpedo BoatLa Melpomene to the Royal Navy.Polish Navy.9. The Poles keep up their high standard of efficiency and discipline.&quot;They are most popular with our officers and men. They are very pleased at theprospect of taking over H.M.S. Dragon, a cruiser, during 1943.Operations.10. The destroyer Krakowiac was several times in action in the Channelduring the month of October. The Blyskatvica took part in the North Africanlanding and sustained damage by air attack. She lost 3 men killed and42 wounded.[24917] b 2
Ships Commissioned.11. The destroyer Myrmidon (renamed Orkan) and the submarine P. 52(renamed Dzik).Recruiting.12. The Polish Navy have now received 840 men from the army recruitsbrought to this country from Russia. A further 250 men are to be released bythe Polish Army shortly to complete numbers required for the Dragon.Royal Netherlands Navy.13. Morale, efficiency and fighting spirit are of the very highest order andrelations between the Dutch and the British Navies are most satisfactory.Successes.14. The submarine 0. 23 attacked a convoy off Penang and a hit is claimedon a 5,000-ton merchant ship.Losses.15. The destroyer Isaac Siueers, which tock part in the North Africanlanding, was lost off Algiers on 13th November.   104 men are missing.Ships Commissioned.16. The submarine P. 47 (renamed Dolfijn) and 3 Motor Minesweepers.8 M.T.Bs. and 4 patrol vessels built in the United States have been commissionedat Curaco.17. It had been decided to allocate submarine P. 66 to the Dutch, but unfortunately the great majority of the crew were lost when the ship.in whichthey were taking passage to this country was sunk. She will not, therefore, betaken over.Royal Norwegian Navy.18. Morale and efficiency improve steadily and the Norwegian Navy isreaching a surprisingly high standard. The fighting spirit is as keen as ever.Relations between the Norwegian and the British Navies are excellent.Successes and Ope rations.19. The submarine TJredd torpedoed a 3,000-ton merchant ship in Vilnes-fiord.   The ship was beached.20. M.T.Bs. 620 and 623 attacked two 5,000-ton merchant ships inAskevold Bay.   Both ships were left sinking.21. Glaisdale and Eskdale, in company with ships of the Royal Navy, werein action in the Channel on the 14th October, when one enemy merchant ship blewup and two escort vessels were put on fire. The Glaisdale and Eskdale also took part in the North African landing, the Glaisdcde picking up 535 survivors fromships sunk.22. The Eskdale was in action in the Channel on the 12th December, in company with four British destroyers. A merchant ship and two escort vessels were sunk and another merchant ship probably sunk.Losses.23. M.L. 125 struck a mine on the 7th November; 2 officers and 3 men were killed.24. The corvette Montbretia was torpedoed in the Western Atlantic on the18th November.   About 40 men are missin&quot;&apos;.Royal Navy (Section Beige).25. The Section Beige continues to do very well. Continued pressure on theBelgian Government is necessary to allocate sufficient men to keep the Sectioncompletely Belgian-manned.
Royal Hellenic Navy.26. With the new destroyers and corvettes we have been giving them the greeks are building up quite a useful force. The morale and fighting spiritare high and efficiency is on the whole satisfactory. The weakest link seemsto be in some of the officers, a few of whom are excellent, but a number not muchgood. The naval ratings are on the whole very satisfactory, but a number ofthe Merchant seamen entered have some way to go before they can come up tothe general standard.Successes.27. The destroyer Queen Olga, operating in the Mediterranean in company with a British ship, is credited with the destruction of an Italiansubmarine on the 15th December.28. The submarine Pupanicolis sank a merchant ship of 6,000 tons in the aegean.Losses.29. The submarine Triton was lost in the iEgean on the 27th November.The great majority of her crew are believed to be prisoners.Ships Commissioned.30. The &quot; Hunt &quot; Class destroyer Miaoulis was commissioned on the9th November. The ex-Italian submarine P. 712 (renamed Matrozos) on the5th December.   9 Minesweeping vessels in the Mediterranean.Training.31. Crews for two &quot;Hunt&quot; Class destroyers which should commissionin February are training in this country. A further 170 officers and men are on their way here from Egypt.PART  II.-ALLIED  ARMY  CONTINGENTS.General Remarks by the Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.32. Since the opening of operations in North Africa, the Allied DefenceMinistries and Military Commands in London have turned their minds very muchto the problems affecting the reoccupation of their own countries. Reorganisa-tion of each of the Allied Contingents, to fit them better for operations on theContinent of Europe, has been in progress for some little time, and, in each case,new establishments have been worked out to agree with their existing strengthsand to give them newer and more modern equipments. Infantry Battalions are particularly affected, and the Norwegians, Dutch and Belgians (the three smallerContingents) are being organised as Independent Infantry Companies, equipped for certain roles which have been indicated by the Commander-in-Chief, home forces. The Poles, are. well under way with the formation of an armoured division (old model), plus an Independent Infantry Brigade. The Czechs are about to submit suggestions for their force which will include an ArmouredUnit, and which allows for the inclusion of some 1,600 of their troops now inthe Middle East under General Alexander, who has agreed to release them. Inaddition various Parachute Units are under training, to be used for their ownpurpose, as may be found best when the time comes.33. All these Allied Contingents, naturally enough in the circumstances,are trying to make their limited man-power go as far as possible, and are,perhaps, trying to do too much with too little, in that they will have noreinforcements. The commander-in-Chief is alive to this fact, and bases hisplans for their use accordingly.French Forces.Establishment and Organisation.34. There are no fixed establishments as the French Forces in this country are principally used to feed the Middle East. The military personnel are dividedinto Services GeneTaux, a &quot; Groupe Mixte &quot; (trained fighting men and recruits)and a small parachute unit.

Three parties each of 4 officers and 24 other ranks have done successiveattachments of three weeks to a Canadian Armoured Division. It was found that both sides profited by these attachments, with the result that the whole of theEseadron Mixte is now doing a two months&apos; attachment to the 5th CanadianArmoured Division.39. Early in December an exercise without troops was held over a large area around Camberley, and later in the month an indoor exercise was held, bothattended by most of the French officers from Camberley and several from theLondon Staff.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.40.

As the minefields at East Haven near Carnoustie had become a menace to aviators using the new aerodrome. Polish sappers were asked to remove the1.300 mines. Some of the mines had become dangerously sensitive, and wereovergrown by long grass and others were under water. The opportunity wastaken, therefore, to train as many Polish sappers as possible in mine-lifting, aswell as men of the Tank Recovery Section. In addition, an exercise, attended by300 spectators (British, including Home Guard, and Polish) was held to demonstrate how to find and blow mines quickly by several different methods, suchas removal by hand after detection by Polish Mine detector, blowing by Corcltexnet and bangalore torpedoes, and by detonating a block of explosives placed 3 to4 feet above the field.45. In November the Poles opened a Corps Battle School at Gullane totake 160 students on Special Assault Courses which lasted from eight tonine weeks.Assistance to Civil Population.46. Considerable work has been done by Polish troops in assisting farmers in agricultural work, especially with the potato harvest, and a high note of goodwill and co-operation has been struck. Officers of Polish Corps Headquartershave given a good lead by turning out themselves one day a week.
Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.47. The big task .of forming an old-model Armoured Division is beingcarried out by the Poles with enthusiasm and efficiency. Unit training with liveammunition has been in progress for some time in the Lammermuirs, but when this Division is completely formed, say, in three months&apos; time, they will require a more extensive training area.48. They are stepping up their Parachute Brigade, and have applied for.equipment for Ancillary Units. To form these, they have shown signs of wishing to.cannibalise their Infantry Brigade, a question which requires considerationfrom our point of view as well as theirs.Dutch Forces.Establishment.

:c&apos; S *Special Points regarding Training.58. The Norwegians have now received their horses consequent on theirreorganisation on a pack basis and a 2 months&apos; Course has been held at their HorseDepot for 5 officers and 10 other ranks from each of the 3 Mountain Companies.59. The Independent Mountain Companies gave a demonstration to theCrown Prince in hill climbing with pack, rock climbing, field firing exercise,including mortars and machine guns, and forest fighting.60. The Parachute Company were attached for a month to the AirborneDivision, and 5 officers and 36 other ranks joined Polish Parachute units for aninstructional Course.61. The Norwegians have provided detachments to attack and test the defences of Coast Artillery Batteries at Nigg and North Sutor.Assistance to Civil Population.62. The Norwegians have met repeated requests for agricultural assistanceto farmers.Change of Command.63. Major-General Oscar Strugstad, C.B.E., relinquished command of the brigade on the 15th December, to become Norwegian Military Attache, and wassucceeded by Lieut.-Colonel Reidar Holterman.Note by Chief Liaison Officer tvith Allied Contingents.64.

In addition to the above, the Belgians have a troop in No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando in Wales.70, The Infantry Battalion is shortly to be reorganised into 3 IndependentCompanies.71. Colonel F. A..Lecomte, who succeeded Lieut.-General Daufresne de laChevalerie as Commandant of the Belgian Land Forces last September, hasrecently been relieved of his command and Major J. B. Piron has been appointedto command Group I and Major M. F. Branders to command Group II.
Special Points regarding training-72. The splitting of the Belgian Land Forces into two Groups is to enablethe fighting units to be attached to a British Division, the Divisional Commanderbeing responsible for the tactical training of the Belgian units.73. For the past three months these units have trained with the49th Division in Wales but the Armoured-Car Squadron has recently moved asshown in 3 above and the other two units will shortly be attached to anotherBritish Division.74. A party of 30 Belgians completed a Course of parachute training atRing way.Note by Chief Liaison Officer ivith Allied Contingents.75. The Belgian Field Units, now known as Group 1, are being moved to theEastern Command, where they will remain attached to one of our formations.The rest, now known as Group 2, will stay in the Leamington area, which is tobe their permanent home in this country.76. I have been infoianed by their Commander that the morale of theBelgian field units has greatly benefited from their close attachment to our49th Division.Czechoslovak Forces.Establishment. Officers.

The two battalions have practised, in conjunction with the home guard, taking up their &quot;Action Stations.&quot;81. A small travelling circus of full-scale models of German Tanks was placed at the disposal of the Czechoslovak Brigade for 5 days in December andother units in the locality were invited to demonstrations.82. A party of 30 Czechoslovaks completed a parachute Course at Ringway,and 72 all ranks did a month&apos;s special training at the Inter-Allied training centre at Inverlochy.A assistance to Civil Population.83.   Agricultural assistance has been given to farmers in the Bedford area.Note by Chief Liaison Officer with Allied Contingents.84. At a Meeting in the War Office, between the C.I.G.S., the Commander-in-Chief and the Czech Defence Minister, the latter pressed for the amalgamation of their two forces, now in this country and in the Middle East, and said that hewould prefer to have all their troops in the latter area. After a discussion, inwhich shipping difficulties, &amp;c, were explained, it was decided to try and bringthe Middle East detachment, of some 1,600 men. to England, and general alexander has agreed.[24917] c
PART III.-ALLIED AIR CONTINGENTS.General Note on Morale.85. Subject to some qualifications (see paragraphs 93, 105, 128 and 130below), morale in the Allied Air Forces remains remarkably high.General Note on Training.88. In the United Kingdom and in Canada basic aircrew training has proceeded satisfactorily during the period under review. Generally speaking,so far as the Polish, Belgian, Dutch and Norwegian Air Forces are concerned&apos;the planned flow of pupils into aircrew training has been maintained but ashortage of candidates has prevented Czechoslovak and Free French Air forces from sending into initial training more than about half the number of pupilsneeded for the full backing of formed Squadrons.87. Space in operational training Units in the United Kingdom has beenprovided to meet the replacement needs of Allied Squadrons in the MetropolitanAir Force. A Polish Flight has been established in, and the existing CzechOperational Flight (previously known as No. 1429 Flight) has been transferredto, a Coastal Command Operational Training Unit; both these Allied Flightsretain their national character.88. No difficulty has been experienced in providing space for Allied pupilsin Schools of Technical Training Command.89. The training of personnel to build up and support the Royal HellenicAir Force and the Yugoslav Air Force is taking place in Southern rhodesia and in the Union of South Africa, where also about 120 Belgians, recruitedin the Congo, are under training, for flying and ground duties.Free French Air Force,Operations.90. No. 340 Free French (Fighter) Squadron has been actively engagedthroughout the period in Fighter Command; the number of hours flying carriedout by this Squadron in operations amounted to 469.91. That part of the Free French Army Co-operation Squadron which isequipped with Blenheim V aircraft has taken part in General Leclerc&apos;s advancethrough the South Libyan desert into the Fezzan Region.Re-equipment.92. Most of the personnel of the &quot; Alsace &quot; fighter and &quot; Lorraine &quot; lightbomber Squadrons have reached the United Kingdom from the Middle East andit is hoped that the former Squadron will re-form on Spitfires about the middleof January 1943. No definite decision has, however, been taken as to the date on which the Lorraine Squadron can re-form; difficulty is being found in making-available type of aircraft that the existing French crews could operate efficientlywithout having first to undergo a prolonged course of basic training.Morale.93. Morale in No. 340 Squadron has been consistently good. That of pilots in the Lorraine Squadron is poor as the result of a long period of inactivity.Appointment of Personal Assistant to General de Gaulle.94. General d&apos;Astier cle la Vigerie, who reached this country from France on the 17th November, 1942, has been appointed personal assistant to general de Gaulle. General d&apos;Astier was created General de Division in 1939 andcommanded the Zone d&apos;Operation Aerienne Nord until the collapse of France.After the Armistice he was in command of the second Air Region.Polish Air Force.Order of Battle (see Appendix II).95. During the quarter under review there has been no change in thenumber of Polish Squadrons. All have been operational, but the three bomber squadrons in Bomber Command have been operating on a temporally reducedestablishment of 10 -f- 2 Wellington aircraft.
Operations.96. In Bomber Command the 3 Polish Squadrons made altogether 420sorties between the 21st September and the 20th December, 1942, taking part inthe raids on Krefeld, Aachen, Osnabruck, Kiel, Cologne, Milan, Stuttgart,Manheim and Turin. Results achieved are believed to be comparable with thoseobtained by the British Squadrons of No. 1 Group. Polish Bomber Squadronsalso carried out 26 mine laying operations, and a good standard of accuracy was maintained.97. Bombing photography has greatly improved and No. 300 Squadronsecured first place in the Group monthly &quot; ladder &quot; for November.98. In Fighter Command, aircraft of the 7 Polish day fighter Squadronsand the one Polish night fighter Squadron operated for 2,979 hours and werecredited with 5 enemy aircraft destroyed and 1 probably destroyed.99. In Coastal Command, No. 304 Squadron carried out 223 sorties. Itwas employed on anti-submarine patrols, anti-shipping strikes andreconnaissances. Reports indicate that the operational and training flying of this squadron have improved, and morale, which was not very high, is thought to beshowing improvement. The following actions are worthy of mention : On the24th September, 1942, one aircraft encountered two Ju. 88s and suffered only slight damage. Both enemy aircraft were hit and one turned over and dived intothe sett. On the 8th October, 1942, one aircraft sighted and attacked a U-boat.On the 7th November. 1942, one aircraft engaged on shipping strike droppedseparate sticks of bombs on each of two enemy merchant vessels, straddling thebows of one. On the 1st December, 1942, one aircraft bombed the larger of two enemy vessels and bombs were seen to burst 40 to 50 yards to starboard.100. In Army Co-operation Command the Mustang flight of No. 309 polish army Co-operation Squadron was attached to a R.A.F. Army Co-operationSquadron during December and carried out - a number of photographic reconnaissance sorties over Northern France.Recridting.101. Of 2,000 Polish Army personnel being transferred to the UnitedKingdom for service with the Polish Air Force, approximately 300 volunteers forair crew are reported to have sailed from Iraq towards the end of November.102. As a result of recent Allied operations a number of Polish service personnel have been released from internment in North Africa. Of those alreadybrought to the United Kingdom, 4 officers and 27 airmen of the old Polish AirForce are being accepted for service with the R.A.F.Formation of New Units.103. In addition to the formation of a Polish Flight in a Coastal CommandOperational Training Unit, referred to in part 1 above, approval has been givento the formation of a Polish Repair Depot within No. 30 M.U. Sealand. Thisunit, which is already functioning, is to be established to a strength ofapproximately 20 officers and 500 airmen. In addition, approval in principle hasbeen given to the formation of the following P.A.F. Units, which are to be formedprogressively as and when P.A.F. personnel become available : 5 Repair andSalvage Sections, 1 Polish Equipment Park, 1 Polish Ammunition Park, 1 PolishM.T. Company.104. Arrangements have been made for a small P.A.F. Meteorological Unit(2 officers and 9 airmen) to be posted to Iraq (R.A.F. Station, Habbaniyah) for duty with a Polish Artillery Unit. This conforms to the policy of attachingRAF. Meteorological personnel to British Army Units.Morale.105. Except in the case of No. 304 Squadron, see paragraph 99 above, reports from operational Commands indicate that morale remains high.Policy.106. As a result of proposals made by the Polish Prime Minister and commander-in-Chief to the Secretary of State for Air, consideration is being given to revising the Anglo-Polish Agreement with a view to providing the polish air Force with a greater measure of autonomy.[24917] p
Royal Dutch Naval Air Service and Royal Dutch Army Aviation (R.A.F.Y.R.).Royal Dutch Naval Air Service.Operations.107. No. 320 (Dutch) Squadron operating in Coastal Command carried out during the period 286 sorties, during which it is claimed that 6 enemy merchantvessels of an estimated total tonnage of 20,500 tons were damaged.108. No.. 322 (Dutch) Squadron based in Ceylon has been established on12+6 Catalinas. No reports on the operations carried out by this Squadronhave been received for the period under review.Royal Dutch Army Aviation  (R.A.F.Y.R.).Formation of Squadron.109. The formation of a Dutch R.A.F.V.R. single-engined Fighter squadron in the Spring or early Summer of 1943 has been authorised. Gixmnd Staff will consist of Dutch soldiers of suitable qualifications, who will be enlisted in theR.A.F.V.R. and receive trade training in the R.A.F. Schools of technical training.Recruiting.110. The main source of recruitment for both the Royal Dutch Naval AirService and the Royal Dutch Army Aviation lies in the Dutch Land Forces in theUnited Kingdom. There has been a noticeable falling-off in the number ofDutchmen who succeed in escaping from Holland. It is belieA-ed that a sufficient number of recruits wall be forthcoming to provide the Maintenance personnel forthe Fighter Squadron clue to form in the Spring or early Summer of 1943, and tomaintain a flowr of 10 volunteers for aircrew training every 4 weeks.Morale.111.   Morale in both Services remains high.Royal Norwegian Air Force.Operations.112. In Fighter Command aircraft of Nos. 331 and 332 (Norwegian) DayFighter Squadrons on operational sorties flew 1,528 hours during the Quarterunder review.113. In Coastal Command, No. 320 Squadron has been operating in Iceland.The greater part of this Squadron will be transferred shortly to the UnitedKingdom and be re-equipped with Sunderland aircraft, a flight armed with fourNorthrop float-planes remaining for some time in Iceland.114. A number of pilots and navigators have been accepted for duty inR.A.F. Operational Squadrons of Bomber Command.Morale.115.   Morale remains very high.Recruiting.116. Recruiting continues on a small scale in United States and Canada,but loyal Norwegians are finding it almost impossible now to escape from Norway.There are* large numbers in Sweden awaiting any opportunity of reaching theUnited Kingdom.The Belgian Air Force (R.A.F.V.R.).Operations.117. No. 350 Day Fighter Squadron in Fighter Command flewr during theperiod on operational sorties 709 hours.Morale.118.   Headquarters, Fighter Command, report that morale is excellent.
Expansion.119. No. 349 Belgian Squadron has been formed in West Africa onTomahawk aircraft. The personnel, both flying and ground, in this Squadron is,at the moment, largely British, but it is hoped in the near future to replace all theR.A.F. flying and many of the maintenance personnel with Belgians.Recruiting.120. During the period under review 122 recruits have been enlisted and29 have been commissioned in various branches of the R.A.F.V.R.Czechoslovak Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations.121. In Fighter Command the number of hours flown on operational sortiesby the three Czechoslovak Day Fighter Squadrons amounted in the period underreview to 2,645.122. In Coastal Command, No. 311 Czech Bomber Squadron carried out217 sorties on anti-submarine patrols, anti-shipping strikes, general recon-naissance and convoy escort work. The following actions are worthy of mention :On the 27th September, 1942, one aircraft attacked a U-boat in face of accuratecannon fire, which wounded members of the crew. The U-boat is believed to havebeen seriously damaged. On the 29th September, 1942, one aircraft was attacked by four Ju. 88s, one of which was probably destroyed. The Czech aircraft, badly damaged itself, came down into the sea about 12 miles off Land&apos;s End and five members of the ci&apos;ew were rescued on the following day. The Captain wasawarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. On the 22nd November, 1942, one aircraft encountered seven Ju. 88s and one Fiat BR. 20. As a result, two of theJu. 88s are believed to have been damaged.- No member of the Czech crew wasinjured and their aircraft was only slightly damaged. On the 23rd November,1942, one aircraft was attacked by three Ju. 88s, one of which was destroyed andtwo others are believed to have been damaged. Again no member of the crew wasinjured and slight damage only was suffered by their aircraft.Morale.123.   Morale has been very good throughout.Recruiting.124. A draft of over 170 Czechoslovak Army personnel has just reached theUnited Kingdom from the Middle East for service with the Czechoslovak AirForce. It is believed that all of these are volunteers for aircrew training. Inaddition, 1 officer and 51 airmen have been recruited during the quarter from the czechoslovak Army and from civil life in this country and 6 airmen have beenenlisted in Canada.The Royal Hellenic Air Force.Operations.125. No. 355 Fighter Squadron and No. 13 G.R. Squadron are both opera-tional in Middle East Command. The latter received congratulations fromCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, for the part they played in the sinking and damage of enemy U-boats, and Air Officer Commancling-in-Chief, Middle East,signalled His Majesty the King of the Hellenes his appreciation of the gallantpart Greek fighters took in the recent battles in Libya,General.126. The target for the expansion of the Royal Hellenic Air Force to fiveSquadrons and a Technical Unit asked for by the Greek Government has beenaccepted in principle. In the first stage towards this end it has been agreed toform a Greek Technical Unit as quickly as possible, largely with already trainedGreek Technical personnel, to form a second day fighter Squadron in the Springor early Summer, 1943, and to train flying and ground personnel to enable asecond &quot;light Bomber Squadron to be formed, possibly in the late Summer of 1943,should other factors, such as the availability of aircraft render this feasible.[24917J d 2
127. The drafting of an Appendix to the Anglo-Greek Forces Agreementdealing with the Royal Hellenic Air Force has almost been completed as a resultof prolonged negotiations between the two Governments.Morale.128. Morale has been good; signs of deterioration amongst unemployedpersonnel are likely to disappear as a result of the development referred to in the paragraph above and the decision to place considerable numbers in flying andtrade training.Royal Yugoslav Air Force.Operations.129. No Yugoslav personnel have been employed in operations during thelast three months. Internal dissension, which had aiTected the morale of the yugoslav contingent, has now come to an end with the settlement of the dispute over the High Command. Accordingly, training can now proceed, and trained personnel will be found employment by the Middle East Command in AirDelivery Units, Maintenance Units, &amp;c. Eventually it is hoped that a YugoslavFlight or Flights will be formed when there are adequate numbers of trainedYugoslav personnel and when aircraft are available. Recently, between 160 and170 of the dissident personnel have rejoined the Yugoslav Air Force. small numbers of trainees are already in Southern Rhodesia and the Union of SouthAfrica.Morale. .130. It is too early yet to express any opinion on the state of moraleamongst Yugoslavs in the Middle East, but reports from the Rhodesian air training crew say that it is good amongst trainees.
