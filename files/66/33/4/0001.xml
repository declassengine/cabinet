13OFFICIAL STATEMENTS BYHIS MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT ONSHACKLING OF PRISONERS OF WAR2nd September,  1942&quot;A German official announcement has stated that orders were given by the British in the Dieppe operations that prisoners hands should be tied to prevent them destroyingtheir papers.      Investigations are being made as to whether in fact any such order was issued.      It is categoricallydenied that any German had his hands tieds      Any such orderif it was issued will be cancelled,,118th October,  1942&quot;Inquiries were instituted after the Dieppe raid.All German prisoners of war brought back to the UnitedKingdom were Interrogated, and unanimously declared theyhad not had their hands tied and had been given humanetreatment.      This statement can be proved by the GermanProtecting PowercAny of the prisoners can be seen by the representativesof the German Protecting Power to confirm this,      Theevidence the enemy have adduced rests on their unsubstantiatedassertions-There is full evidence of the humane treatment ofprisoners of war by British troops, and if the GermanGovernment carry or-t the threats mentioned in theircommunique the British Government will have to consider their future action,, &quot;(This followed the statement by the German High Commandsaying that German NoC.O&apos;s and men had had their hands tiedat Dieppe and in the Sark raido)9th October,  1942&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government repeat the declaration thatthey do not and will not countenance any orders for thetying of the hands of prisoners of war taken in the fieldsThe action of the German Government in taking reprisals against the British prisoners of war in their hands is expressly forbidden by Article 2 of the Geneva Convention,Nevertheless, should the German Government persist intheir intentions, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be compelled,in order to protect their own prisoners of war,  to take similar measures upon an equal number of enemy prisoners ofwar in their hands6&quot;-1-

9th October,  1942&quot;The German Government having put into operation the illegal action threatened in their communique,  the War Officeannounces that, unless the German Government release the prisoners captured at Dieppe from their chains, an equal number of German prisoners of v/ar will be manacled and chainedas from 12 noon on Saturday,  October 10*12th October,  1942&quot;In the Dieppe raid an order was issued, withoutauthority,  to the effect that &apos;Wherever   possible the handsof prisoners of war will be bound, so that they cannot destroytheir papersf0      On the complaint of the German Governmentthe War Office at once, before there Is-A been time tzmake&quot;inquiry,  issued a statement that,  if any such order hadbeen issued,  it would be countermanded^, because they consideredthat such an order might be held to imply that,  irrespective of the circumstances,  the hnnds of prisoners of war should be bound.On inquiries being mades  no evidence was found that anyof the prisoners brought beck from Dieppe had had their handstied.      But the existence of the order came to light,  and itwas countermanded.The raid on Sark was carried out by a party of 10officers and menc      Seven of the party captured five Germans.The hands of the Germans were tied in order that arms mightbe linked with the captors.      No orders-  written or otherwise,had been issued.      But the prisoners had to be taken past aGerman-occupied barracks on the way to the boats,  andprecautions were therefore necessaryc      In spite of the precautions, four of the five German prisoners of war brokeaway, shouting, and had to be shot to prevent them raising the alarm,.The Geneva Convention contains no statement about tyingthe hands of prisoners., but prescribes humane treatment.The question at issue is,  therefore, what constitutes humanetreatment.Clearly this differs according to circumstances.      Thereis a wide difference between what is appropriate to a prisoner in safe custody and to prisoners in the course ofbattle0      It will be observed that the actions complained of by the German Government relate to action in the course ofbattle0The German Government have, however,  themselves taken action to tie the hands of prisoners of war in their custody,and far removed from the battlefield, as an act of reprisal.Acts of reprisals against prisoners of war are specificallyforbidden by the Geneva Convention0&quot;Igth October. 1942(Statement by the Prime Minister.in the&apos; House of .CcjmaonF)&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have never countenanced anygeneral order for the tying up of prisoners on the field of battle.      Such a process however may be necessary from timeto time under stress, of circumstances, and may indeed be inthe best interest of the safety of the prisoners themselves,

The Geneva Convention upon the treatment of prisonersof war does not attempt to regulate what happens in theactual fighting.      It is confined solely to the treatment ofprisoners who have been securely captured and are in the responsible charge of the hostile Governments      Both HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the German Government are bound bythis Convention^,      The German Government by throwing intochains 1370 British prisoners of war for v/hose proper treat-ment they are responsible have violated Article 2 of theaforesaid Convention,      They are thus attempting to useprisoners of war as if they were hostages upon whom reprisalscan be taken for occurrences on the field of battle withwhich the said prisoners can have had nothing to doc,      this action of the German Government affronts the sanctity of the geneva Convention which His Majesty&apos;s Government have alwaysbeen anxious to observe punctiliouslyoHis Majesty&apos;s Government have therefor-:, approached the protecting Power and invited that Power to lay before theGerman Government our solemn protest against this breach ofthe Geneva Convention and to urge them to desist from it,  inwhich case the counter measures of a similar character whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government felt themselves forced to take inorder to protect their prisoners of war in. enemy hands v/illimmediately be withdrawn,,Until we learn from the Fro tecting Power the result ofthis protest I have no further statement to make upon thesubject and I should strongly deprecate any discussion whichmight be prejudicial to the action of the Protecting Powerand consequently to the interests of the prisoners of war ofboth belligerent countries      As soon as a reply is received,a further statement will be made to the House,, &quot;10th December.  1942&quot;A communication was received by His Majesty&apos;s governments in the United Kingdom and in Canada from the Swiss Governmenton December 8th suggesting that they and the German Governmentshould free all prisoners of war in their hands from shackleson December 15th at 10,00 hours.      They were informed that an identical communication had simultaneously been made to theGerman Government,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom welcomethis initiative, and as evidence of their desire to respondfully to the spirit in which the Swiss Government&apos;s approach was made, have given instructions for the German prisoners  tobe unshackled on December 12the      It is understood that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in Canada are taking similar action,&quot;-3-
