NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.I. Enemy shipping in the Central Mediterranean has been successfully attacked by&apos; our submarines and destroyers.Light forces have successfully raided Tripoli harbour.Five U-boats have been sunk and others have been damaged1.Shipping losses have been light.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. The &quot;Norwegian Submarine Uredd, on patrol off the west coast of norway, probably torpedoed a German submarine depot ship of the &apos;* Saar &quot; class(2,710 tons) on the 17th.3. M.T.Bs.. on patrol off the Dutch coast, on the night of the 18th/19thattacked a ship escorted by two large trawlers. M.T.B. 224 sank the ship andM.T.B. 70 torpedoed one of the trawlers.4. Norwegian-manned M.T.Bs. 631 and 626 shelled the wireless station andwatchpost at Stensund (South-West Norway) on the 20th. It is believed that the wireless station was wrecked.5. H.M. Destroyer Roxborougk was damaged in heavy weather in theN.W. Approaches.  The captain wTas killed and one rating was lost overboard.Mediterranean.6. During the week a convoy from Malta reached Alexandria without incident.On the night of the 19th/20th, three M.T.Bs. carried out a raid on Tripoliharbour. A U-boat in tow of three tugs was sunk off the entrance and one tugwras set on fire and beached. The M.T.Bs. subsequently attacked the Mole andwere heavily engaged by shore batteries. All the M.T.Bs. were hit but were not seriously damaged ; two ratings were wounded.On the 19th, II.M. Destroyer Lamerton shot down a S. 79 Italian torpedobomber off Bougie.. 7. The following attacks have been reported by H.M. Submarines : P. 35 offthe east coast of Tunisia sank a 2,000-ton ship, set on fire two caiques and damaged a 1.000-ton tanker between the 9th and 11th. Turbulent shelled andtorpedoed a 2,500-ton ship south-bound off the S.W. coast of Italy on the 11th.On the same day she shelled and set on fire a goods train. P. 44 torpedoed a7.000-ton ship west of Sicily on the 17th. P. 42 torpedoed and probably sank a 5,000-ton transport off Djerba (Tunisia) on the 19th. The Greek SubmarinePajjonicolis captured a 220-ton caique in the ^aegean Sea.8. H.M. Destroyers have reported the following successes : On the night of the 15th/16th. Pakenham and Javelin sank the Italian naval stores carrierTanaro (1,339 tons) east of Djerba (Tunisia), taking 28 prisoners. Nubian andKelvin sank a 4,500-ton ship and damaged an escort vessel north of Tripoli onthe 16th. Lightning and T^oyal sank a 3,000-ton ship to the south-east ofSardinia on the 18th. On the night of the 18th/19th, Pakenham, Nubian andthe Greek Destroyer Queen Olga, on patrol off the east coast of Tunisia, sank theItalian naval trawler Stromboli which was carrying petrol to Lampedusa. Eightprisoners were taken. Kelvin and Javelin, whilst operating off the Tripolitaniancoast sank four small naval auxiliaries and seven other small vessels on the night of the 19th/20th.9.   H.M. Submarine P. 311 is overdue from patrol and is considered lost.10. During the week naval aircraft sank two ships and torpedoed a destroyer off the east coast of Tunisia. In Libya, in co-operation with the R.A.F..they provided flare illumination and diversionary bombing for a naval operationoff Tripoli.II. It is estimated that during the week some 20,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk by our aircraft.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. The Italian U-boat Navalo, on passage from Tripoli to Taranto, was sunk by H.M. Destroyers Pakenham and Hursley, after being damaged by oneof our aircraft. A number of survivors were rescued, including some Alliedofficers who had previously been taken prisoner.
H.M. Canadian Corvette Port Arthur, escorting a westbound convoy, sankthe Italian U-boat Tritone off Bougie.   Twenty-three of the crew were captured.Promising attacks were carried out by our aircraft, three in the N.W.Approaches south of Iceland (C) and one in the Bay of Biscay.The following belated reports of attacks by U.S. surface craft and aircraft have been received : U.S. Submarine Grayback destroyed a Japanese U-boat inRekata Bay (Solomon Islands) on the 25th December. On the 3rd January,U.S. Destroyer Earle probably damaged a U-boat south of the Azores and two days later probably sank another. U.S. aircraft damaged a U-boat off trinidad and on the 6th sank another off Fortaleza (Brazil).  Three survivors were rescued.Enemy Intelligence.German.13. The Scharnhorst and- Prinz Eugen are believed to have returned to theBaltic from the Skagerrak. -It is reported that the Hipper was damaged in the action off northern norway on the 31st December.Italian.14. The three &quot; Littorio &quot; class battleships, which had been unlocated sinceleaving Naples on the 6th December, were seen at Spezia on the 16th January.Enemy traffic across the Mediterranean continues to be concentrated onSousse and Bizerta and, to a less extent, on Tunis.Japanese.15. The estimated strength of the Japanese forces in the S.W. Pacific is :Two 16&quot; and three 14&quot; battleships, one aircraft carrier and three convertedcarriers (174 aircraft), six 8&quot; cruisers and seven light cruisers.U-boats.16. U-boat activity persists on the N. Atlantic convoy routes, particularlyin the areas south of Iceland (C) and N.E. of Newfoundland, outside the limit of canadian based aircraft.A Japanese U-boat has been reported off Sydney (Australia).Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During the week ending the 17th/18th, 842 ships have been convoyed.Of these 209 were in ocean convoys and 633 in British coastal convoys.Sixty-three destroyers (including five U.S. destroyers), and 76 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including two U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.During the week 86 ships in four ocean convoys arrived in Home waters without loss.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 16th totalled 515,000 tons, compared with 621.000 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 483,900 tons for the past ten weeks. Of the week&apos;imports 244,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked five ships, ofwhich four are known to have been sunk.An oil refinery ship in a homeward bound convoy was sunk in the N.W.Approaches. Two cased petrol carriers were sunk off the Libyan coast. One ship was sunk and another torpedoed off Sydney (Australia). Three ships on Govern-ment service were damaged by enemy aircraft in or near North. African ports.One ship was mined and beached off the west coast of Scotland.British Minelaying.19. Surface craft laid mines in the St. George&apos;s Channel and off theDutch Coast.Aircraft laid mines off the German North Sea Coast, off the Biscay ports andin the Mediterranean.[249381 b
MILITARY SITUATION.(Outline maps two sections showing operations in Russia are includedin this summary as insets.)The Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.22. In a combined attack conducted from the west by the Leningradgarrison, and from the east by the main forces, the Russians have capturedSchlusselburg. They have thus opened an entry to Leningrad by land along thesouthern shore of Lake Ladoga. Russian claims, however, do not yet indicatethat rail communication with the city has been re-established.Central Sector.23. The Russians are reported to have suffered considerable casualties intheir capture of Velikie Luki, but the isolated German garrison which had beenholding out in or near the town has now, the Germans claim, fought its &quot;way out and re-joined the relieving force which had been attacking from the south-west.Upper Don Sector.24. As the result of a new offensive, south of Voronezh, announced on the16th, the Russians have already secured two notable successes :  (a) They have gained control of a considerable stretch of the double-linerailway Voronezh-Rostov, which, when restored, should greatlyfacilitate future Russian operations in the whole Southern Sector.(&amp;) Striking south-westwards along the railway Svoboda-Kupyansk, theyhave captured Valuiki, an important junction for German communica-tions from the Ukraine to the Voronezh front. German pockets of resistance left behind in this advance are being eliminated.Stalingrad Sector.25. In continued heavy attacks from all sides against the encircled GermanSixth Army the Russians have considerably reduced the area held by this force,but the Germans still appear to be receiving some supplies by air.Don Sector.26. The main progress of the Russian offensive is now in the north, wherethe right flank, resuming its advance, has taken Millerovo, has forced the line ofthe Donets River at Kamensk, and threatens Likhaya, one of two junctionsthrough which rail communications from the Ukraine pass to Rostov. The lineof the Donets has also probably been reached by the Russians from Kamensk toits confluence with the Don.   The advance in the Russian centre, between the DonEnemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.20. Minelaying by enemy aircraft off the East and North-East Coasts was suspected on three nights of the week.E-boats may have laid mines off the Norfolk coast and off the Wash on the16th and 19th respectively. Fifty-eight moored mines have recently been sweptoff the North Foreland.The mine totals are : 2.752 magnetic, 1,326 acoustic and 2,109 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. The German tanker Spichern (9,323 tons), which was damaged by air attack in November when attempting to leave the Bay of Biscay for the Far East,was seen in Brest on the 15th January.The German blockade runner Regensburg (8,068 tons) was torpedoed by aU.S. submarine in the Sunda Straits in November. According to recent reportsshe was beached in Sumatra and later taken to Singapore.
and the Sal, has made little further progress; it appears to be meeting with supplydifficulties, and with stubborn German resistance. Russian progress on theirleft flank has at some points reached the line of the River Manich andProletarskaya, about 20 miles north-east of the important junction of Salsk, hasbeen captured.Caucasus Sector.27. Continuing their pursuit of the German forces north-westward astride the railway Baku-Rostov, the Russians have reached the general line Petrovskoe-Nevinnomisskaya-Cherkessk. The German rear guards are reported to be fightingstubbornly and isolated pockets are holding out deep in rear of the Russianforward troops.Summary.28. The Russian offensive in the Don area appears to be aimed notnecessarily at the capture of Rostov itself, but at the cutting of communicationsthrough Rostov from the Ukraine to Northern Caucasia. The Russian advancedown the railway Voronezh-Rostov past Kamensk now threatens one of theselines of communication. There is still no sign that the Germans intend a complete withdrawal from Northern Caucasia; they may still hope, should rail communi-cations through Rostov be cut, to supply their forces in Caucasia by sea transportacross the Kerch Straits.Tunisia.. 29. During the past week continued bad weather has confined operations to little else but vigorous patrolling by both sides.In the northern sector there have been some sharp engagements in the areaof Del Aouana and on the 17th our forces attacked an enemy strong point fourmiles north-east of this town.Our forces have also been active in the area of TIeidous and on the 18thwe advanced north-east in two columns to positions seven miles north of the village. The right column withdrew after meeting stiff enemy opposition. the left column reached positions on the high ground eight miles north of Heidous.Further south, on the 18th, the enemy made two simultaneous attacksdirected on Bou Arada. The first attack was launched from the north-eastand, after two hours&apos; fierce fighting, was driven off with losses to the enemy. Thesecond attack, which included some armour, was put in from the east. This wasalso successfully beaten off and eight enemy tanks were destroyed. Our artillerythen engaged a concentration of tanks and infantry between Pont Du Fansand Bou Arada whilst our forces continued to clear the area north of the lattertown.   During tihe 19th minor engagements were reported.On the 18th, an enemy infantry and tank attack south-west of Pont Du Fahspenetrated French positions north of the Kebir Reservoir and early on the 19thhad reached a road junction two miles to the south-west of the reservoir. Theposition is still obscure.In the southern sector French troops captured a pass at Hir Karaghoun,23 miles south of Pont Du Fahs. During the engagement they captured over200 prisoners including 25 Germans. Enemy attacks on the French positions at Fondouk have been repulsed successfully and the French have nowstrengthened their positions in this area. Despite enemy pressure, the station at Sened, east of Gafsa, is still in our hands.Libya.30. The preliminary move forward of our forces proceeded smoothly andwithout interruption. Until the 14th bad weather hindered observation, butthere was considerable movement of enemy M.T. and tanks in the southern partof the position, and enemy patrols were active.The Eighth Army began their general advance at 0715 hours on the 15th.One infantry division advanced on the coastal sector with Gheddahia as their objective, and met some opposition on this day. Further to the south two divisions, one of them armoured, advanced westwards, but met with fairly stiffopposition towards the southern end of the German line. By the evening the.enemy&apos;s southern flank had been located. During the night 15th/16th the enemywithdrew from the Wadi Zemzem position and our forces followed up. On the16th the advance continued, and by.evening our leading.troops had reached a lineT24938] b 2
running from a point on the road 15 miles N.N.W. of Gheddahia, to just north of Sedada and to Bir Tala (25 miles S.E. of Beni Ulid).The advance on our left flank was delayed by a skilful use of the enemyarmour and anti-tank guns, and on our right flank by mines and artillery. Bythe 18th our leading formations, moving along the coast road, were 13 miles west of Misurata, and our armoured formations 12 miles south of Zliten and 20 miles north-west of Beni Ulid, the latter after a brush with the enemy rearguard atBeni Ulid during the morning. On the 19th enemy movement continued north-west from Tarhuna. but 750 M.T. remained in the area of Tarhuna with arearguard south-east of the village.During the night 19th/20th roads were packed with enemy M.T. to a point100 miles west of Tripoli. On our right flank our infantry passed through Zlitenand entered Horns, and during the afternoon of the 20th were in contact with enemy rear guards 6 miles west of Horns, and our armoured cars were also in contact at Cussabat (15 miles S.W. of Horns). On the left our armouredformations occupied Tarhuna on the morning of the 20th, but an enemy rear-guard, strong in guns, continued to hold a defile, 9 miles to the north-west,throughout the day.   .New Guinea.31. On the 18th Australian troops captured Sanananda. Only smallpockets of the enemy remain.Between the 11th and 14th an Australian force carried out a successful raidon Mubo, 12 miles south of Salamaua, destroying the enemy HQ. and wireless station and inflicting heavy casualties; 116 Japanese dead were counted, theAustralian losses were insignificant.Intelligence.France.32. Various reports indicate the transfer of German formations from france, almost certainly to Russia. The move of 7th Panzer Division is confirmed,but the number of other divisions which have moved or may be moving is not yet known.Far East.33. It is estimated that 5,000 Japanese reinforcements were landed at Laefrom the convoy which reached there on the 8th; that the Japanese strength inthe Lae-Salamaua area is now therefore 10,000; and that the total in the wholeof New Guinea is 15,000.34. One Japanese division has left Central China and is believed, to been route to New Britain via the Caroline Islands. This reduces Japanese strengthfrom twelve divisions to eleven in Central China and increases it from two divisions to three in the Pacific Islands.AIR  SITUATION.General Review.35. Bomber Command aircraft made two heavy attacks on Lorient and twoon Berlin.The enemy carried out propaganda reprisal raids on London.Targets in Tunisia and. Tripolitania were subjected to heavy attacks by allied bombers. Approximately 20,000 tons of enemy shipping were sunk by aircraft in the Mediterranean.United Kingdom.36. The scale of enemy effort was considerably higher than for some time past. Two raids, one at night in two phases and one by day, were directed against London. Effective interception by fighters and a heavy A.A. barragedispersed most of the raiders before their objective was reached and few of themgot past the South London area.On the night the 17th/18th about 35 long-range bombers flew in the directionof London, followed, eight hours later, by the same number.   About 50 reached
the outskirts of Greater London, 25 of which penetrated within a radius of10 miles from the centre; the remainder operated against scattered districts inSussex, Surrey and Kent. Features of the operation were the large number ofdifferent units represented, each by a few aircraft, and also that at least half thetotal force was drawn from some half dozen different Reserve Training Units.Our night fighters, of which two are missing, destroyed eight bombers and damaged three. On three other nights, a total of 35 enemy aircraft was activeoverland; three Avere destroyed, and two damaged by fighters.In daylight on the 20th, about 60 fighter-bombers operated overland, 12 ofwhich flew to the Outer London area. Our fighters shot down 13 enemy aircraft,three more were probably destroyed and 11 damaged; two Spitfires are missingbut one pilot is safe. Other daylight raids involving a further 15 aircraftresulted in the destruction of another enemy fighter-bomber.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.37. No large-scale bombing operations were attempted, but effective attacks were made by six escorted Bostons and six Mosquitoes on Cherbourg and .theDiesel works at Hengelo respectively. At the former many bursts were seen inthe dock area and, at the latter, which was attacked from 50/1,000 feet, bursts were seen on the boiler shops, and other bombs are believed to have hit the engineerecting shops and the Diesel motor store. Two of the Spitfires escorting theBostons collided over France and were lost.Aircraft of Fighter and Army Co-operation Commands directed againstrolling-stock on the railways of Northern France and Belgium, damaged at least26 locomotives and also attacked railway wagons, signal boxes and small coastaland canal craft. In the seven fighter sweeps which were carried out, a furthernine locomotives were damaged. Enemy casualties in these operations totalledeight fighters destroyed and 14 damaged.   Six of our fighters were lost.Night.38. Strong forces of our bombers, amounting to a total of 658 aircraft, ofwhich about 87 per cent, were &quot; heavies,&quot; were despatched against land targetson four nights of the week and made two raids on Lorient and two on Berlin.At Lorient, which was attacked on the nights of the 14th/15th and the15th/16th, bright moonlight and excellent visibility, combined with well-placedflares, enabled most crews accurately to identify the target. A total of 537 tonsof H.E. and incendiaries was dropped and many large fires were left burning in both the town and the dock areas; a particularly heavy explosion near No. 4Dry Dock and one large oil fire were observed. Wellingtons, sea-mining offLorient shortly after the second attack, confirmed the intensity of the fires inthe town.Berlin, which was last bombed by the R.A.F. in November 1941, was attacked on the nights of the 16th/ 17th and 17th/18th by 269 &quot; heavies &quot;; these dropped697 tons of incendiaries and H.E. (including 10 x 8,000-lbs. and 122 x 4,000-lbs.).On both raids, heavy cloud to within about 10 miles of the target made Berlinextremely difficult to locate. In the first attack, however, the weather over the target itself was clear with good visibility, but snow on the ground obscuredthe aiming point; after considerable searching the pathfinder force droppedtheir flares, which were reported as being accurately placed by many crews wholater identified the target visually. Although fires generally were scattered, agood concentration was reported near the Alexander Platz Station. On thesecond night, heavy cloud with large breaks was passing across the target duringthe period of the attack and the flares from the pathfinders were less concentrated.The majority of crews bombed on the estimated position of Berlin althoughseveral claim to have identified built-up areas of the city where scattered fires were reported.From the four operations, in which two enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat, 27 of our bombers are missing.Intruders which operated on five nights of the week oyer Northern Franceand Belgium attacked, without loss, 37 goods trains and locomotives.(At the end of this Resume will be found Graph No. 1, showing the bomber command effort against land targets to 31.12.42.)
sCoastal Operations.39. Six Hudsons made a successful bombing attack on a convoy of 15 ships with.two escort vessels off Texel. Three ships of 1,500, 2,000 and 2,500 tons were hit, and a 4,000-ton ship may have been damaged by a near miss.Off the Norwegian Coast, a Hampden bombed a 500-ton ship, which was leftsinking.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 99 were despatched, laid 232 sea mines in enemy waters.(Graph No. 2, attached to this Resume, shows the air effort on sea-minino-to 31.12.42.  N.B.-One sea-mine - 1,500 lbs. or, say, -f of a ton.)Mediterranean.French North Africa.40. In spite of variable hying weather, Allied bombers made effectiveattacks on Axis ports and other objectives in Tunisia, during which a largeweight of bombs was released, including 56 tons on Sfax, 42 tons on railway centres at Djebel Dj el fond (South of Tunis), 32 tons each on Sousse and Bizerta,and 19 tons on Tunis. The tonnage of bombs dropped on these targets in several other heavy raids is not yet available.Fighters and light bombers carried out harassing operations against road and rail movements in the battle area. A train, believed to be laden with petrol,was blown up between Grombalia and Turki. A number of M.T. was destroyed and others damaged in other sectors of the front, including 20 destroyed onthe road between Mareth and the Tripolitanian frontier.Three enemy attacks were made on Tebassa airfield resulting in damage to four U.S. aircraft on the ground; incomplete reports indicate that seven enemy and two Allied aircraft were shot down. Two Allied aircraft were destroyed and twodamaged on Maison Blanche airfield, two of the attacking aircraft being destroyedby A.A. gunfire. There have been no reports of any appreciable effort against our supply base at Bone; the few aircraft which approached turned away oninterception by our fighters. Some enemy aircraft were, hoAvever, reported tohave been active against shipping in Algiers Bay.Libya.41. Tripoli, with its harbour and targets in the vicinity, was bombedheavily every day and night by aircraft based in Libya, Algeria or Malta.Shipping, military stores, railways, a power station, searchlights, the GovernorsPalace and road junctions were hit and numerous fires started. Bombs were also seen to fall among two large groups of vehicles.Many tons of bombs were dropped, by day and night, on Castel Benitoairfield, where 200 enemy aircraft had been sighted. The heavy, medium and light bombers taking part in these raids came from both Libya and Algeria. Inone very successful attack 13 large fires, including an oil fire, and 20 smallerfires broke out on and around the airfield and a violent explosion was seen.During the Axis movement westwards, Allied medium bombers and fighter-bombers maintained constant pressure, bombing and machine-gunning road trans-port columns both along the coast road and in the southern areas. Excellenttargets were found and many vehicles were destroyed in the earlier stages but,later, M.T. became more dispersed. Particular attention was also given to roadjunctions. On the 18th, bombing sorties in the Tarhuna district by Kittyhawks(P. 40E) alone totalled 136. Airfields in the battle area were vigorously attacked and our squadrons based in Tripolitania moved, forward very rapidly to advancedlanding-grounds as the enemy evacuated their airfields. Our aircraft were thusenabled to operate as far west as Zuara 70 miles west of Tripoli.Enemy activity increased in the earlier part of the period under review.On the 14th, 13 Allied aircraft failed to return from an escorted attack on badlydispersed aircraft at Bir Dufan landing-ground, having encountered considerablefighter opposition. Later, enemy activity was much reduced, probably owing totheir withdrawal from forward landing-grounds to airfields in the Tripoli area;many of our offensive operations were completed without opposition. On the19th, however, the enemy, having established himself at new airfields, showedmore aggression and. our forward troops were dive-bombed and attacked by fighters.Two attacks on Tamet landing-ground and in the Sedada area caused no damage and when six aircraft attempted to raid Tobruk, four of them were destroyed.
Southern Italy, Sicily and the Sicilian Channel.42. Continuous anti-shipping searches and sweeps were flown. Thefollowing ships were attacked :  Ship. Location. Result.9,000-ton      ... ...

Seriously damaged.Several other promising attacks on enemy supply ships were reported, thoughdetails are insufficient to establish the results.At least 15 enemy aircraft in transit between Sicily and Tunisia were destroyed. The landing ground on Lampedusa Island was raided on five occasions when bombs fell among dispersed aircraft and airfield buildings were attacked with cannon fire and fires started.Escorted bomb-carrying Spitfires made six hits on a chemical factorynorth-east of Pachino (Sicily); a fire resulted. A locomotive was destroyed north of Pozallo, 33 miles S.S.W. of Syracuse. The power station at Porto Empedoclewas bombed and the target is believed to have been hit.Intruder patrols continued to be flown over Sicilian airfields.India and Burma.43. Enemy positions in the Akyab area have, throughout the week, been attacked by Allied bombers and fighters; small craft and other objectives in the coastal areas south of Akyab were also attacked.In Central and South Burma, Hurricanes and Mohawks (P. 36) operatedagainst river craft on the Chinclwin and Irrawaddy rivers, and targets onthe Burma State railways. U.S. Mitchells (B. 25), operating from China, bombed the railway junctions at Maymyo and Monywa and, in North Burma, made two attacks on Kamaing, where considerable damage was done to barracks and other buildings.At night, Allied medium and heavy bombers attacked enemy airfields atMagwe, Shwebo, Meiktila, Heho, Tennant and Toungoo.U.S. Liberators (B. 24) bombed the docks at Bassein and three, ships nearRangoon; one ship was left sinking and another is believed to have been damaged.Enemy aircraft made night attacks on Budge Budge (S. of Calcutta), Chitta-gong and on Fenny airfield (55 miles N.N.W. of Chittagong), which was renderedtemporarily unserviceable. Two of the four aircraft attacking Budge Budgewere destroyed by Beaufighters. as were all three aircraft which made an abortiveattempt to bomb Calcutta; one Beaufighter was lost.On the Burma/China frontier, U.S. fighters and medium bombers attackedLashio, and river craft at Bhamo. A night attack by 18 escorted enemy bomberson Yunnanyi (375 miles N.E. of Mandalay) was intercepted by U.S. Kittyhawks(P. 40), which destroyed seven enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a furtherfive; one Kittyhawk was lost.Indian Ocean.44 On the 15th, U.S. heavy bombers attacked a convoy of two ships withnaval escort, 250 miles S.S.E. of Rangoon; one 7,000-ton ship was left in asinking condition and the other, of 5,000 tons, is believed to have been damaged by near misses.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.45. Allied aircraft made six bombing raids on Lae, where the targetsincluded the airfield and fuel and supply dumps on the water front; two attacks were also made on Malanang (near Lae).   Several attacks, mostly by single U.S.
Liberators (B. 24), were made on the airfields and wharf areas at Madang andFinschafen, and Bostons (A. 20) continued to harass the enemy in the Sananandaarea.   From these operations no outstanding results are reported.About 24 escorted enemy bombers attacked an airfield at Milne Bay; some damage was done to aircraft and M.T., and several fuel dumps were destroyed.A smaller attack was made on Merauke, where a jetty was slightly damaged.New Britain.46. II.S. Fortresses (B. 17) made one day and two night attacks on shipping at Rabaul. Hits were observed on two medium-sized ships and there wereexplosions on three others. A total of eight attacks, usually by single U.S.bombers, were made on the airfields at Ga.sma.ta and Cape Gloucester.New Ireland Area.47. A TJ.S. Liberator (B. 24) bombed and sank an 8,000-ton cargo ship,110 miles W.S.AY of Kavieng.Solomon Islands.48. On the 15th, four attacks were made by Allied, aircraft on enemy destroyers and shipping; one destroyer, off Guadalcanal, was hit and left on fire,two more were seriously damaged 140 miles north-west of the Island, and a cargo ship was hit twice 37 miles north-west of Munda. Of enemy aircraft whichintercepted, 15 fighters and 12 float-planes were destroyed for the loss of six U.S.aircraft. On the same day. three more enemy aircraft were shot down nearGuadalcanal.Other operations by U.S. aircraft included three attacks on Ballale Island(off the N.E. coast of Shorthand Island), two on the Kahili area on BougainvilleIsland, and an attack on the enemy base at Munda. New Georgia.Russia.49. Reports of recent air operations are scanty. During the week ended the16th January, the Russians claim io have destroyed 265 German aircraft for theloss of 133 of their own. They also claim that, in the Stalingrad area, aircommunication with the encircled &quot;Sixth Army has almost ceased, and that, duringthe past few weeks, 600 German transport aircraft have been destroyed on this front. An indication that the Russian Air Force is keeping well up with the advance of the Russian armies is given by the location, on the 15th January, ofsome 230 Russian aircraft in an area on the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway, some60 miles behind their forward troops.German aircraft carried out several small attacks&quot; against Murmansk onthe 10th January, and some small-scale raids have been reported against the black Sea ports of Tuapse and Gelendshik.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.50. The two outstanding events of this week&apos;s enemy raiding have been the attacks on the London District on the night of the 7th/18th, and the daylight attack on the 20th. In neither case was damage substantial nor of military importance.   A feature of the night raid was the high proportion of U.X.B.By Day.On the 15th damage was done to house property at Eastbourne. A numberof minor bombing, cannon and machine-gun incidents was reported from places in Sussex and Kent.On the 17th, Ventnor wTas bombed, property was damaged and utility services were affected.On the 20th, shortly after mid-day, bombs were dropped at scattered points in S.E. London; a number of machine-gun attacks were also made. A direct hiton an L.C.C. School at Lewisham caused a number of casualties amongst thechildren and a fire was started in the Surrey Docks; elsewhere the damage wasnot extensive. The casualties are so far reported to be 70 killed and 162 injured.Bombs were also dropped and machine-gun attacks were made at a numberof scattered points in Sussex and Surrey and at Shanklin on the Isle of Wight,but nowhere was the damage heavy nor the casualties high.
By Night.On the 15th/16th, fires were started and damage was done to private property in Lincoln; minor incidents also occurred in the East Riding and in Lincolnshire.On the 17th/18th, Outer London was attacked. No bombs fell on central london, and most of the incidents were reported from the southern suburbs, butbombing was very scattered; 22 boroughs, chiefly those lying south of the riverbetween Woolwich, Lewisham and Wandsworth were affected. A number offires were started, and there was temporary dislocation of transport and utilityservices; some factories, docks, oil and food stores were affected. At bothCamberwell and Croydon casualties were higher than in other boroughs, but otherwise little more than minor incidents were reported, and nowhere was there any serious damage.

APPENDIX VI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Erance.A bbeville jDrucat. Photographs taken during the attack on the 13th Januaryshow at least 70 bomb bursts within the northern dispersal area of the aerodrome.Several of these are direct hits on aircraft shelters, while the majority have burstat the entrances to the shelters and many others have fallen amongst airfieldbuildings.St. OmerI Fort Rouge. Photographs of St. Omer taken on the same day show12 bombs bursting in the north-east dispersal area. Direct hits have been obtained by H.E. and incendiary bombs on four or five aircraft shelters causing fires, andother bombs have burst on the perimeter track.Romilly-sur-Seine. It is reported that the attack by the U.S.A.A.F. on the20th December was noteworthy in that, apart from the damage to stores and hangars, considerable casualties were caused among the German personnel. Thiswas particularly so in the flak positions. A direct hit was also scored on theofficers&apos; mess. In the stores (seen by photographs to have been damaged) importantstocks of cognac were destroyed. The morale of the French in the neighbourhoodwas raised by the attack. It is confirmed that the bombs shown by photographsto have burst near to the Paris-Troves railway lines in fact damaged them in several places and repairs were not completed until,the 22nd December.Germany.Duisburg. An eye-witness states that during the attack on the 6th /7thDecember one of the major incidents was the almost total destruction of thetramway depot. (Damage confirmed in the photographic reconnaissance.) Thiswas the main depot for the whole of the town and as it was night it was full. Theadjacent tram repair depot was also almost totally destroyed. These incidentscaused an almost complete traffic standstill for four clays and all works were affected by absenteeism and late arrivals, particularly those situate on the outskirts of the town. It was impossible to utilise relief trams from other townsas Duisburg had a non-standard gauge. A skeleton bus service was eventuallyput into service, but this was insufficient to handle the traffic and late arrival ofworkers at factories persisted for some time.Sea-mining.The following results have been reported : *(i) In the beginning of June 1942 the motor vessel Antares, of 270 tons,was mined in the Langland Belt,(ii) On the 12th June, 1942, a German cargo boat sank near the entrance to Bayonne.   Though the reason was given by the Germans as a boilerexplosion, the real cause was, in fact, a mine.(iii) On the 3rd August a fishing vessel was mined in the neighbourhood ofthe lie d&apos;01eron.(iv) On the 12th November a German dredger was mined and sank off Gdynia,(v) As a result of sea-mining operations on the night of the 8th-9thDecember, the ferry between Warnemiinde and Gjedser was stoppedfor two days.(vi) On the 12th December the Danish tug Kristine was mined and sank inthe Great Belt.(vii) On the 15th December the fishing vessel Anna was damaged by a minesouth-west of Skjoldnaes Light in the Little Belt,(viii) On the 22nd December the fishing vessel S.G. 143 Gerda was mined and sank at the south entrance to the Little Belt.
