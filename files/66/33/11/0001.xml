WAR    CABINETU-BOAT BASES IN THE BAY OP BISCAY.MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.The strength of the German Atlantic U-boat force is approximatelyoperated from the four bases:    Lorient, St.  Nazaire, Brest and LajBlice.      The Italian Atlantic force whose base is Bordeaux does notBunt (/to more than 15 U-boats, but it is thought that the Germans arelikely to extend Bordeaux as a submarine base to accommodate some ofHeir increasing flotillas.Lorient, St.  Nazaire, Brest and La Pallice are. at present the back-one of the German U-boat operations against our trade.    Between 75 and0U-boats are always there, and all normal repairs and refits areapried out there.      The first three ports are equipped with, concretefilters to take upwards of 20 - 25 U-boats.      La Pallice is equipped toake about half the number of the other ports, but is capable of devel-pnsent.      The shelters are probably proof against bombing though this haslet to be finally tested.The four bases,  in order to maintain so many U-boats, must be keptpking smoothly and to capacity.      The evidence is that servicingacilities are being run at absolutely full stretch, and that anyislocation of work would be likely to interfere seriously with the turn-Bad of the U&apos;-boats.      The resulting delay would soon cause a bottle-leek.     Some U-boats at sea would then have to curtail their patrols inder go return on the longer route to Norway or Germany, and would againake longer to get back to the patrol areas.      Moreover dislocation at&quot;fi base would probably make the enemy overcrowd the others, renderinge U -boats themselves more vulnerable to attack, since they could not allaccommodated in the shelters.      For example,  interference with thepckyard facilities at St. Nazaire in a raid on the 9th November resultedjn a bunching of 11 U-boats at Lorient.The concrete shelters probably preclude any important destruction of-boats in the bases by bombing, but there is  every hope that thepstruction of buildings and dockyard facilities by large scale attacksould most seriously impede maintenance both of the U-boats themselvesnd, probably,  of their supply ships.      Our own experience at Maltaaggests that although the effect of destroying facilities would betemporary, a serious dislocation of U-boat maintenance, even if for sohort a period as 2 or 3 months, would have a most beneficial effect onp shipping figures.      Lorient, the headquarters of the U-boat commandss the most vulnerable of the bases because entry to one shelter, whichjOlds 12 U-boats, is over a slip up which the boats are hauled.    A.hitft this would temporarily put the shelter out of operation and immobiliseII the boats in it..    While in port the crews are mostly either v/ithin the concretebelters or scattered in the surrounding country.      Nevertheless, heavy?* sustained attacks on the bases must affect them to some extent,^specially as they are always worked exceedingly hard.      The minesweepingNsels and auxiliaries serving the ports would also suffer destructionM damage and the morale of their crews also would be affected.      all his would have direct reactions on U-boat operations.&quot; jlj^urthermore ,  the dockyard workers are largely French and heavypbing would certainly give rise to serious labour difficulties in thefekyards.      Our experience in the Mediterranean is that even lightwbing drives  faint-hearted labour away from the docks and FrenchmenFKlng for the Germans are unlikely to have much stomach to face heavyombingo40

7o      Approval has already been given to precision bombing of the bases, and 8 attacks on a scale varying from 12 to 50aircraft have been made.      Some destruction of facilities hasbeen achieved,  and although&quot;no noticeable reduction in the numberof U-boats at sea has been observed, this was hardly to beexpected from these spasmodic and comparatively small-scaleattacks.      The Naval staff emphasise that important results canonly be achieved by sustained attacks over a definite period,both &quot;with precision bombing, when opportunity offers, and areabombing? whenever weather is suitable,,8.      The arguments for trying out such sustained attacks onthe U-boat bases are simply stated -(a) The shipping shortage will, and does indeed already,restrict our whole offensive strategy.      During thepast year, approximately four-fifths of our shipping losses have been due to the U-boat,      This amountsto 5,653,085 tons and these losses are having an effect on the morale of our merchant seamen.(b) The rate of destruction of U-boats at &quot;sea is inadequate even to check, much less reduce, theenemy&apos;s effort,  for the U-boat fleet has grownsteadily all the time-      In consequence,  the constant improvement in our A/3 devices and methodsbarely enables us to keep our heads above water.Although large-scale bombing of bases may notTJroduce wholesale destruction of U-boats, this isthe one means, apart from a seaborne raid, bywhich a far-reaching blow might be struck, andstruck quickly, at U-boat operations.      This meanshas not been tried.(c) The face that the U-boat bases are concentrated in four ports enables us to strike heavily at thewhole Atlantic U-boat organisation without dissipatingour air forces.9.      The sustained and heavy bombing required to achieveimportant results may mean diversion of effort from bombingGermany for a specified period;    but the U-boat threat brooksno delay if we are not to find our own offensive power gravelyweakened for want of shipping.      The bombing of U-boat buildingports is no alternative,,      Apart from the limited effect achieved in the past by such bombing, it would not materially influenceU-boat operations for well over six months, and it is within thenext six months that we expect the shipping situation to be mostacute.10o    If desired,  the French population could be warned beforeheavy bombing, of the U-boat bases starts that they must leave theareaSo      They have already experienced our precision bombing and arelikely to realise that we mean business.      Even though the people ofBrittany generally are among our best friends those who work in the docks are directly contributing to the enemy&apos;s war effort and we mustbalance the loss of - French lives against those of our own merchant seamen.      Necessary military bombing has been carried out in numerousparts of France and on enemy bases in Tunis.      Where the reasons forour attacks are easily understood, there is no evidence that theyarouse undue resentment, at any rate outside the area affected.?-l&quot;    I accordingly ask the War&quot; Cabinet to approve area bombing of theU-boat bases in the Bay of Biscay and to direct that these targetsshould be given priority during the coming months.A.
