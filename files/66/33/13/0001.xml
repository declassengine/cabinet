JjLWAR CABINETRECEPTION AND ACCOMMODATION OP REFUGEESMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe War Cabinet at their Meeting on the 23rd December,  1942*approved the appointment of a Cabinet Committee to consider andreport what arrangements could be made for the reception and accommodation of such Jewish refugees as might be able to find their way out of enemy occupied territory through Bulgaria orPortugal.The Committee (of which tlbecome a member) have held- two following general conclusions;.e Deputy Prime Minister agreed toMeetings5  and have reached the(a) That no differentiation should be made as betweenJewish and non-Jewish refugees,  and that therefugee problem should, be dealt with as a whole.(b) That the problem should be regarded as a united nations responsibility in respect of which each nation should agree to make a definite contribution.The Committee are of the opinion that the next step shouldbe to try and persuade the United States Government to agree thatthe problem should be dealt with on those lines;    at the sametime, in view of the immediate necessity of affording some measure of relief to refugees now in Spain and Portugal,  theUnited States Government should, be invited to accept a number ofthese refugees.With this in view, a telegram to H.M. Ambassador, Washington,has been prepared and is attached as an Annex to this memorandum.I ask for the approval of the War Cabinet to the despatch of this telegram.A second telegram, with which I have not thought It necessaryto trouble my colleagues, will set out the extent of the contribution which the British Empire has made to the solution ofthis problem.(Intld.)

A IT N E XDRAFT TELEGRAM TO H.;A  AMBASSADOR^ WASHINGTON.Your telegram No,  6293 /of 31st December:    U.S.   co-operationover refugee problem/.It appears impossible to meet the refugee situation nowdeveloping in Europe without a systematic consideration of alternative destinations,   either immediate or eventual, for the many thousands of persons now crowding into neutral countries.His Majesty&apos;s Government are impressed with the necessity for.consultation and joint effort in dealing with this aspect of theproblem.      Three considerations emphasise this:-(1) The refugee problem is not wholly Jewish and there are so many non-Jewish refugees and so much acute sufferingamong non-Jews in Allied countries that Alliedcriticism would probably result if any marked preferencewere shown in removing Jews from territories in or threatened &quot;by enemy occupation;    there is also thedistinct danger of stimulating anti-Semitism in areas where an excessive number of foreign Jews areintroduced.(2)  It would raise false hopes to announce alternativedestinations in excess of shipping probabilities.(3)  There is the possibility (for some hint of which pleasesee my telegram No.   .....)  that the Germans or theirsatellites may change over from the policy of extermina-tion to one of extrusion,  and aim, as they did beforethe war, at embarrassing other countries by floodingthem with alien immigrants.2.      While,  however, giving full weight to these considerations,we find it impossible to make a mere negative response to a growing international problem disturbing the public conscience,involving the rescue of people threatened by Germany&apos;s extermina-tion policy.      It is physically impossible,  on the score ofShipping limitations alone, for this country or even for theUnited Nations  is a whole to contemplate meeting in full what may prove to be an unlimited demand;    a great part of the refugees who leave German-occupied Europe will have to continue to bereceived in neutral countries, whom we should endeavour toencourage not only by material help but by assurances  (which the swiss Government has in fact requested)  that the refugee problem will be brought within the United Nations rehabilitation plans atthe end of the war.      The absorptive capacity of accessible&apos;neutral countries in Europe seems,, however,  to be approaching itslimit,  and Allied Governments cannot very well go on exhortingthose countries not to turn any refugees back without offeringco-operation in accommodating a proportion of them.3.      The United Kingdom and Colonial contributions to the refugeeproblem should be generally known,      It should be emphasised thatGreat Britain, with stringency of food and housing under war conditions,  is accommodating nearly 100,000 refugees  (not including Allied forces or merchant seamen), while the Coloniesare straining their resources of food, labour and accommodation in housing many scores of thousands of refugees in addition to civilian internees, British and Allied evacuees and prisoners ofwar;    East Africa alone has taken in more than 2-g- times its Whitepopulation.

Despite the substantial contribution already made byPalestine and the considerable difficulties of food, labour and accommodation which exist there, we have within the last fewweeks offered to take 4,500 children accompanied by 500 women from Bulgaria.      Owing to the acute security question inPalestine, we are not prepared except possibly in individual cases to accept male adults from enemy or enemy-occuoiedcountries but we shall continue to do everything possible tofacilitate the admission of children within the limits imposed by the 1939 White Paper.      For further details of the effort by united Kingdom the Colonies and Palestine please see my immediately following telegram. 354.      We are well aware of the generous reception accorded,though (it may be noted) well within the limits of the immigration quotas,   to many thousands of refugees by the UnitedStates and of the action taken by them in &quot;finding other outlets,in particular San Domingo after the establishment of the EvianCommittee on the President&apos;s initiative.      We also appreciate that the United States,  although obviously physically more remote from the war and with less strain at present on food and housing,  shares our pre-occupations in regard to security,  andin addition has legislative difficulty in regard to anyimmigration which goes beyond the quota.      As, however,  theUnited States offer to take large numbers of refugee children from France has shown these difficulties can be overcome and ifyou can confirm what Sir Herbert Emerson has reported to me,namely that the United States Government is prepared to admitrefugee mothers accompanying their children,  and speed up itsimmigration procedure for all bona fide refugees who apply to united States Consuls in Europe,  then it would appear that theUnited States Government would be prepared,  as part of aninternational effort,  to make an immediate offer of homes for a proportion of the adult refugees now reaching neutral countries.It would be fair to expect such an offer to be related to whatthe United States has done so far and its potentialities in food, housing and general absorptive capacity:    study of the quota statistics suggest, moreover,  that there is a wide marginfor action without any fresh legislation.      I trust therefore that the United States Government, appreciating that the time is past for any unilateral action on this problem, will be ableto agree to take a definite practical lead in solving, it.Reception in the United States has at least one vital advantage over reception in the United Kingdom, namely that in the latterall additional persons received require not only shipping to transport them here but start new shipping demands for their maintenance as long as they are here.      In spite of this,however,  and notwithstanding the other obvious difficultiesreferred to at the beginning of paragraph 3, His majesty&apos;s government would not dismiss the possibility of further effort.They would,  in response to a lead from the United StatesGovernment and as part of a general endeavour by the united nations to cope with this problem, be prepared to take a proportionate share.      In particular,  over and above the large part already played by the Colonial territories, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to examine the question whether there is any scope - even though it is now bound to be very limited - for further admissions into the Colonies.      It is unlikely,  for the reasons already indicated,  that any but avery limited number of refugees could in future be accepted intothe United Kingdom,  and if it proved practical to accept hereany further refugees,  as part of a comprehensive inter-Alliedsolution, His Majesty&apos;s Government must reserve to themselves the right to accommodate them in the Isle of Man,  possibly under conditions of detention, and can give no guarantee at thisstage as to their ultimate disposal.35 Not circulated.

I 5(     If an understanding could be reached between His Majesty&apos;s^Government and United States Government in regard to such ajjco-ooerative offer, way would be open for approaching other^Governments of the United Nations for example Latin-American(countries  (except Mexico which has made a very considerableIfoffer of assistance in regard to Poles from Persia),  the british dominions or even neutrals to ascertain what they would be[prepared to contribute towards the solution of the most:immediate problem.      This would have to be done with the minimumlof publicity over details,  and for this reason His Majesty&apos;sIjovernment would, be inclined to deprecate any kind of formalinternational meeting, but some kind of private conference oflillied Representatives would appear to be most expeditious and[practical procedure,  and if its main result was to elicit fullIstatements of what various Governments were doing andjdifficulties in the way of their doing more,  this would be useful..6.      I should be glad if you would,-  unless you see any objection,(discuss the question on the foregoing lines with the State(-Department.      You should say that we are glad to hear &apos;of-despatch of Governor LehmanTs representatives to North Africaland that we should be interested to hear their views as to theScapacity of North&quot;Africa to accommodate a substantial proportioniof the refugees from Spain and Portugal,  and the possibilitiesIof a civil administration taking responsibility for thisjjproblem,  in which administration His Majesty&apos;s Government would?oe ready to take their share,      Problem,  however,  appears to be too pressing to be deferred until after the report of the:crepresentatives, at least so far as a gesture of sympathy andIpractical help from the United Nations is concerned.      You might?add that co-operation between United States and british   Embassies at Madrid has already produced useful local results,but we must try to meet a real need;    we must also be prepared[to anticipate possible unfavourable action by or appeal fromjSpanish Government.      For this purpose we must get to gripswith question of alternative destinations.      This is the reasonfor our approach to the United, States Government.      Theirre-actions,  if favourable,  should give us so;ae approximate ideaof the number of visas for adults they are prepared to issueforthwith for entry into United States, number they are preparedto secure by influence in San Domingo,  assistance they areprepared to afford in shipping,  and. finally their views on the composition of the suggested United. Nations conference on this sub ject.
