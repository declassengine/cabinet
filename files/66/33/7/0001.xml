THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.V/WAR CABINET.COLONIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THREE memoranda on the subject of the relationships of India and burma to the proposed Regional Commission for South-East Asia, have recentlybeen circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 575),the Minister of Labour (W.P. (42) 606), and the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (42) 614).Important as is this subject, I cannot help feeling that it is premature toenter into an argument about it, when neither the broad principle of the regional Commission, nor its composition, functions or territorial scope, hasbeen agreed with the United States, let alone with Russia or China.2. There are only two ways in which India and Burma could be associatedwith the Regional Commission : (a) As Colonial territories, in which case we, as the Parent or Trustee State,would represent them on the Commission;(&amp;) As States having a major strategic or economic interest in the area.3. With regard to (a), I think we are all agreed. The declaration is not intended and, from its phraseology, could not be held to apply to countries likeIndia and Burma. The United States may take a different view but we shouldmake our own view clear at the outset and stick to it.4. With regard to (6), when once the area covered and the functions of theCommission have been defined, it can be decided as a matter of fact whetherIndia and Burma have a major economic or strategic interest in the region and should with advantage be represented on the Regional Commission. I agreewith the Lord Privy Seat that the mere fact of a considerable Indian population in one of the territories would not, of itself, constitute a major economic interest.5. I fear that the fourth paragraph of the memorandum by the lord privy Seal may convey an impression, which I am sure he does not intend. Hewould appear to argue that membership of the Regional Commission wouldgive either India or China &quot;a right to intervene in the internal administrationof Malaya.&quot; But that is not our intention. One of the fundamental points of the proposed declaration (and the point on which we already know thatMr. Cordell Hull agrees) is that internal administration in a Colonial territoryshall remain the sole responsibility of the &quot; Parent &quot; State.6. I hope, therefore, my colleagues will agree to postpone any decision onthis particular point until we have a clearer idea of how the general scheme islikely to develop.O. S.Colonial Of/ice,January 5, 1943.SECRET. Copy No.    2 3W.P. (43) 7.January 5, 1942.[24863]
