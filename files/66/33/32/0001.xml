(43) 32.January 16, 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.GRANT OF POWERS OF PUNISHMENT OVER BRITISH service personnel TO INDIAN COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and the Secretaryof State for India.UNDER Minute 10 (3) of W.M. (42) 119th Conclusions the War cabinet approved the grant of powers of punishment over British personnel to IndianCommissioned Officers, on the understanding that in the case of the Air force the necessary legislation could be carried out in India.While it is practicable to give effect to the decision by means of Indianlegislation, the Government of India have represented that this course iscumbrous and likely to produce difficulties and complications, while the desiredend can be attained by a simple amendment of the definition of officer inSection 190 (4) of the British Air Force Act.We have examined the position further in the light of the Government ofIndia&apos;s representations and are satisfied that the simpler course is to make thenecessary amendment by means of a Clause in the forthcoming Army and AirForce (Annual) Bill, and we therefore propose, with the concurrence of the leader of the House, to adopt that course.A.
