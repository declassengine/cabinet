I believe that the Minister- of; Poodys paper (WlPe (42) 619)was written on the assumption that Congress would very shortly   beasked to grant a substantial appropriation for the purchase of relief Stocks,  and that the report of the State Departmentrecommending this formed part of the Administration policy.3, A telegram from Sir Frederick Phillips (No.6295 of the30th December&apos;.) makes it clear that there will be no immediateapproach to Congress f     an aw vropritafcion tor Reliefc    I have no^confirmation that the Pa js idea,   has approved the report of theState Department Committee,, though it may well be that it -is under examination by the Combined Food Boards,.4. I agree that our representatives in Washington should beauthorised to say that we will contribute what supplies we cantowards Relief subject to the replacement of stocks if necessary,5, I agree also that we have much to gain from a decision tobring these Relief supplies problems under the Combined Boardsmachinery.    Generally,  therefore,  I am in agreement with paragraph of the Minister of Food&apos;s paper,6. I am net in agreement,  however, with paragraph 9,    I donot understand that the time has yet come; in which a declaration about our   post--mar      consumption policy,  or the continuance of-rationing- on -account --ofRel-tedp Ife   &apos;e-juiruO.    If the 1&apos;resiaentapproves the report of the State Department!s Committee I am advised that this will involve  the application of rationing in theUnited States upon a much wider scale than would otherwise benecessary.    If this occurs,  then it may well be a suitable timefor us to consider a declaration to the effect suggested by theM inister o f F o a d,7c.       . As regards the. question of raw materials, we should go muchmore cautiously.    There has as yet been no approach from the americans on this and we do not know what facilities the various countries will immediately have for mating use of e.g. wool orcotton to turn into clothes,    We do not know the extent of the damage that will have occurred to their textile machinery or aboutthe availability of tin   -* skilled labour.     If we display too muchpremature willingness t    dispose of the few liquid assets we shallhave at the end of the war? we may regret it.    That does not mean that, within reasonable limitss  we should not be willing bo supplyraw materials for the most-urgent need when the position has been more closely examined-1-

8. I desire to refer to the decision of the Cabinet on 29th June, (W.M.(42) 83rd Conclusions, Minute 8, that we must make a clear distinction between the physical or supply aspect of the problem and the financial aspect. We cannot afford to give away without payment such stocks as we may possess at the end of the war. We have no reason to believe that the United States will press us to do this, or that the allied recipients of Relief are expecting it. There are some countries such as Poland, Czechoslavakia and Jugoslavia who have no resources, but are in dire need and must be helped without any question of payment; the position of Greece is uncertain. There are others such as Norway, Belgium, Holland and France who possess substantial resources in sterling or in gold and can reasonably be expected to pay us for what we supply, although like ourselves, they may be hoping for liberal lend lease arrangements from the United States of America. Of course, if we were supplying goods that had been sent to us on Land Lease terms and these goods were to be replaced on similar terms, which on food will often be the case, we should not charge the recipient country.

9. Finally, although I am entirely in agreement with the general view that we should express our willingness to give all the help we can, we must recognise that what we will make in practice a relatively small contribution to physical supplies, except in connection with surplus Army stores, cocoa and the use of shipping. We cannot claim to compete in generosity or bountifulness with the United States for obvious reasons. The United States and the Allies have reason to know that our people are putting everything they have into the war, and they are likely to be willing to put everything they reasonably can spare into Relief. So long as we do this we are discharging our duty fully.
