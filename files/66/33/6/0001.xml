(43) 6.January 4, 1943.WAR CABINET.COLONIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.WITH reference to W. P. (42) 544, I circulate, for the information of theCabinet, a copy of the telegram sent to the Dominion Governments, together withthe replies which have now been received from the four Dominions, on the subjectof Colonial policy.C. R. A.January 4, 1943.Telegram to Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.(Sent December 11, 1942.)(D. No. 538.   Most Secret.)Following from Prime Minister for Prime Minister :  We have for some time past had under consideration the question how to dealwith the considerable volume of criticism which is heard from time to timeregarding British Colonial Policy. Recent events in America for example,Mr. Luce&apos;s article in Life and Mr. Wendell Willkie&apos;s recent speeches, have raised the question in an acute form. It is clear that there is a widespread and rootedfeeling in the United States which regards the British Colonial Empire as equivalent to the private estate of a landlord preserved for his own benefit.Clearly, this view is unreasonable, but it is no use ignoring its existence. More-over, we must, if we can, endeavour to get the United States to express their willingness to enter some general defence scheme which would include the defenceof Colonial areas. Their assistance, however, will not be forthcoming unless wecan secure their general goodwill. With this in view, it is essential that we should act now to convince United States opinion that our Colonial policy is not a dangerand an anachronism, as certain quarters in that country are inclined to regard it.Some time ago His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington had a discussionwith the United States Secretary of State on this matter. Mr. Hull referred tothe question how the statements of the Atlantic charter could best be utilisedto guide opinion wisely in relation to backward peoples of differing grades andcapacities, and said that his idea was to get some general statement in which we might all assert broad purposes making plain that attainment of freedom involvedmutual responsibility of what he called &quot;Parent States&quot; and of those whoaspired to it. He was prepared to include a very clear expression against officiousintervention from outside with affairs which were responsibility of parent State,and said that wide variety of the problem could be appropriately stressed.It appears to us that Mr. hull&apos;s  suggestion affords a valuable basis forfurther action, and we have been considering, in consultation with General Smutsduring his visit to London, what would be most convenient course.It seems to us that, as a first step, it would be desirable that we should endeavour to remove the misconceptions about British Colonial policy which areprevalent in the United States and elsewhere. We should explain the principles on which our Colonial policy has been founded, how, within our resources, we[24854] b
have consistently applied liberal ideas in social, economic and political spherefor the benefit of the peoples concerned, and how our administration of backwardterritories has never meant that others have been deprived of free access to their resources. Lord Cranborne&apos;s recent speech in the House of Lords was thereforedesigned with this object in view.It is clearly important that we should encourage the United States to lookoutwards rather than inwards and to be a world power rather than a hemisphericpower. For this purpose we should do well not to resent, but rather to welcome,American interest in the British Colonial Empire, and there would be advantages in so arranging our affairs that the&apos; United States join in public acceptance of aline of policy towards Colonial peoples and their development. As a next step,therefore, we should propose to follow up the suggestion thrown out by Mr. Hulland propose a joint declaration (to which other Colonial Powers might possiblysubscribe) on the general Colonial question. Such a document, if participated inby the United States Government, should do much to damp down the restless,irresponsible and ignorant criticism which has been prevalent in America and help to dispel the illusion that this is an Anglo-American question, whereas it is, ofcourse, of equal concern to all Powers with oversea possessions. It would not, ofcourse, constitute a formal commitment on the part of the United States to join in a general defence scheme for Colonial areas, but it would certainly be a step towards the acceptance of obligations for defence.We are greatly attracted by Mr. Hull&apos;s conception of &quot; Parent States &quot;andsomething on the lines of his remarks on that point would be an essential basisof the declaration. With this in mind as a basis, the jjjue which we should like tosee such a declaration take would be as follows : (1) First aim of United Nations is to defeat present aggression and renderfuture aggression impossible.(2) This aim requires for its successful achievement the establishment of conditions under which security and prosperity can be assured to all nations. Since it is evident that there are certain peoples whose sociaiequipment and resources are not yet such as to enable them to achieve these ends by themselves, it will be a clear responsibility of all ParentStates to enter into general defence schemes designed to ensurefreedom from fear for all peoples.(3) The Parent States must aim to promote the social, economic and politicalwell-being of peoples who are unable, without danger to themselves and to others, to assume full responsibility for their affairs. Defencehaving been assured, the Parent States, with their special qualifica-tions for the task, must accept the duty of guiding and developing thesocial and political institutions of the territories with which they areconcerned, that their peoples may in due course be able to discharge theother responsibilities of government.(4) By this combination of defence and orderly development the ParentStates will fulfil their responsibilities to those peoples and enable themto enjoy rising standards of life and to continue their advance along the path of progress. In pursuance of this policy the natural resourcesof Colonial territories will be organised and marketed not for the promotion merely of commercial ends, but in the best interests of the peoples concerned and of the world as a whole.We should propose that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should, in the first place,sound Mr. Hull on the above list of points as the basis for a declaration.If Mr. Hull agrees that a declaration on these lines would be in accordance withhis views His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador would then explain to him that we thinkthat practical application of these principles would need to be discussed and agreed as soon as the declaration had been published and inform him that our line of thought is :  (a) That necessary practical measures would take the form of machineryfor consultation and collaboration between Parent States with the aim of ensuring a common policy in those regions of the world inwhich they have interests as Parent States. For this purposeRegional Commissions, composed of representatives of such States,should be constituted. Provision should also be made for the representation of nations which have a major defence or economic interest in the regions concerned. Such regions might be, first, theFar East, secondly, Africa and, thirdly, the Western Atlantic, andany others which, at a later stage, may seem appropriate.
(b) That within this framework and subject to the principles laid downin paragraphs (2) and (3) of the Joint Declaration responsibility for administration of its own territories would rest with the individualParent State concerned.Should be glad to learn as soon as possible whether you have any commentsor suggestions to make regarding the above proposals. You will appreciate that we are very anxious to proceed with the matter with the least possible delay.Telegram from Canadian Government, December 23, 1942.(No. 274.   Most Secret.)Your telegram D No. 538 and our interim reply No. 271.1. We are hesitant to comment on the substance of your proposals for thedevelopment of Colonial policy, since we feel that this must remain the primary responsibility of the Government of the United Kingdom, and of the other partsof the British Commonwealth which control Colonial territories. We are,however, deeply interested in the effect on Anglo-American relations of problemsof Colonial policy. The comments which follow contain our estimate of the effecton United States opinion, both official and general, of the proposals outlirTed^Tnyom^-telegramrWe do not wish to express any definite views on how colonial policy should be developed. Our particular concern is whether these proposals are, in fact, likely to achieve their purpose.2. We are in general agreement with your estimate of the importance of taking steps to deal with criticisms in the United States of British Colonial and indian policy, and also with the desirability of following up Mr. Hulfssuggestion for a joint declaration on this subject to which other Colonial powers might subscribe.3. We have no special comments to offer on the first six paragraphs of yourtelegram, except to say that the criticisms of British Colonial policy found inthe United States are also present to some degree in Canada.4. Concerning the proposed joint declaration, we consider that the emphasisplaced on defence in paragraph 2 is likely to be misinterpreted in the UnitedStates, and to be regarded in some quarters, as an effort to secure indirectly a priorcommitment for participation in the defence of the British Colonial Empire inadvance of a general settlement. We believe that at this stage it is wisest toassume that the victory of the United Nations will result in an effective systemof international security, and to refer only incidentally to defence in this approach. While security is a prerequisite of progressive Colonial development,it is, of course, equally important to States which are not Colonial Powers.5. It seems to us that informed opinion in the United States would considerthat points three and fourPbT the proposed declaration ought to be expanded toinclude some recognition that Colonial development has become a legitimatesubject of international concern. It would meet this if the reference to theresponsibility of &quot;parent States &quot; were extended in the declaration so as to makeit clear that this responsibility is not only towards the indigenous peoples, butalso towards enlightened&apos; world opinion. While there is much in the presentcriticisms in the United States that is ignorant and captious, the main concernwould appear to be, not merely to explain and defend the record, but to encourage a greater sense of responsibility for orderly progress throughout the world.6. This might be accomplished if the proposed declaration were expandedso as to make the approach less negative and conditional. For example, greater emphasis might be placed on the rights of native peoples to participate as much aspossible in the conduct of their own affairs, and the opportunity might be takento remove misgivings about the universality of the Atlantic Charter and to under-line that the various declarations on the necessity of raising living standardsafter the war apply to Colonies as well as self-governing areas.7. Regarding the practical application of the principles of the declaration,the proposal to establish international regional commissions would, we think, ingeneral be welcomed in the United States, but it appears to us that opinion therewould expect more than the admission of the United States and other&apos; directly interested countries for the purpose of &quot;consultation and collaboration&quot; on condition that they assume some responsibility for security. Your suggestion would limit participation to &quot;parent States,&quot; and nations with major defence and economic interests in the regions concerned. Critics might argue that[24854] E02
&quot; parent States &quot; ought clearly to recognize their position of trusteeship, not onlytowards the people of Colonies but also towards the rest of the world, and thatthis requires the introduction of genuine third party opinion, involving-participation in regional commissions by representatives of countries withoutgreat interests in the regions. Furthermore, unless some provision is made for representation on the commissions of the indigenous peoples themselves, the scheme might not be regarded as constructive and progressive. Some importance might also be attached to the right of the proposed international bodies to maintain their own technical staffs and to&apos; make their own investigations in colonial territories.8. We do not profess to judge whether it is feasible at this time for proposalsof greater weight and content along the lines suggested above to be presented tothe Government of the United States. We fear, however, that the approach willnot achieve the desired results unless it is more comprehensive and explicit.Telegram from Australian Government, January 2, 1943.(No. 2.)Your telegram TJ No. 538.We have given consideration to the contents of your telegram and to yourand hull&apos;s  views on question of Colonies. At the moment we do not propose tooffer any exhaustive comment, but we think it important that you should beacquainted with preliminary observations on the matter.2. You will be aware at the outset of views of Commonwealth government as expressed by Minister for External Affairs in House of Representatives on 3rd September last.   Relevant passage from this speech is as follows :-Begins: It is becoming more and more clear that the military overthrow ofour enemies, although our primary aim, will in no way be obstructed, but will be assisted if positive plans are now laid as to the course to be pursued in thepost-war period.In this connexion, the past declarations of the leaders of the United nations are an important starting point, especially the principles of the Atlantic Charter,and the Presidents subsequent declaration of the four freedoms.While in the United States I found many who were particularly anxious tohave promulgated a special Charter covering the future of the. peoples of the pacific and of South-East Asia. Why not, it was said, establish a Pacific andAsiatic Charter, on the lines of the Atlantic Charter. This question shows a misunderstanding of the true position. .By subscribing to the Atlantic Chai&quot;ter, all the United Nations have nowdeclared &quot; First. Their countries seek no aggrandisement, territorial or other.Second. They desire to seek no territorial changes that do not accord with thefreely expressed wishes of the people concerned. Third. They respect the rightof all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live, andthey wish to see sovereign rights and sclf-Government restored to those who havebeen forcibly deprived of them.&quot;The United Nations have also expressed their hope for a peace which will&quot; afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their ownboundaries, and which will afford assurance, that all the men in all the lands maylive out their lives in freedom from fear and want.&quot; (The sixth principle.)They have also declared that, while they believe in the eventual abandonment ofthe use of force, aggressor nations must be disarmed pending the establishmentof a wider and permanent system of general security (eighth principle).But the name &quot; Atlantic Charter,&quot; which has been given to this declaration,does not refer only to the Atlantic region, or to Powers having interests in the atlantic. The Charter derives its name from the place where it was signed. The28 nations which have subscribed to it extend around the globe, and the declarationis universal in its scope and application. It follows that the future of the regions of the Pacific and of South-East Asia are to be governed by the broad principles of,the Atlantic Charter.Some consequences of this may properly be suggested. The first principle which must be applied is that of security. Accordingly, in keeping with the eighth principle of the Charter there should be established a system of general security which will be as effective in these Pacific and Asiatic regions as in allother parts of the world. Pending the establishment of such a, system the aggressor must be disarmed. And that aggressor is Japan the only PacificPower which since 1931 has systematically employed its armed forces for thepurpose of territorial aggrandisement.
While security comes first, the Charter also assures to the peoples of South-Eastern Asia and the South-West Pacific that they shall be able to live out their lives in freedom from want, as well as in freedom from fear. These peoples cannotbe excluded from the system of economic collaboration which the United. nations have envisaged..Australia, as one of the countries of the South-West Pacific, will have aparticular interest in closer economic relations with her nearer neighbours.For some years past, Japan has propagated the notion of a co-prosperity spherebut, ever since 1931, and increasingly so since she commenced to exploit the newly occupied areas in Malaya, the&apos; Philippines and the East Indies, it hasbecome plain that the so-called co-prosperity sphere means only this that japan is to get the prosperity while the subject peoples get a lower standard of living and the status of serfs or slaves.In the post-war world, the reorganisation of these regions cannot be on theJapanese system. We are now fighting to end that system. Moreover, our post-war order in the Pacific cannot be for the sole benefit of one Power or group ofPowers. Its dominant purpose must be that of benefiting the peoples everywhere.If &quot; freedom from want &quot; means anything it means that the age of unfairexploitation is over. If the attainment of a higher and better standard of lifefor all the Pacific peoples involves any changes in forms of Government&apos; or administration, either as a means of progress or as a consequence of it, theUnited Nations must be ready to make the necessary changes. In short, we mustfound future Pacific policy on the doctrine of trusteeship for the benefit of all the pacific peoples. That doctrine the Commonwealth-has&quot; endeavoured to carry outin New Guinea under the mandates system of the League of Nations. Japan&apos;srecord as a mandatory Power only proves that a solemn trust can bebetrayed.   Ends.3. As Colonial policy will be one of the main questions affecting post-warrelations of United Nations, as well as one of the chief tests by which the readiness of the United Nations to apply the principles of the Atlantic charter will be judged, we feel that the.initial approach to the matter should be on the widest possible^b-asis. An approach arising mainly from a desire to meet&quot; currentcriticism Tn the United States is, in our view, far too narrow. Because it wouldbe essentially defensive, it could hardly provide a satisfactory basis for reaching a genuine accord of view with United States administration. The question should be presented to the United States, and in clue course to other principalPowers interested, as an integral and highly important part of the whole range of questions affecting the post-war international order, in which it is essentialthat the British Commonwealth should work in accord with the principal united nations.4. For these reasons, a condition precedent to the initiation of the matter with the United States Administration would appear to be a most carefulpreliminary examination, and, if possible, prior agreement among the membersof therBritish&quot;Commonwealth on broad fundamental principles. In this connexion, the degree and extent to&quot;which parent States are prepared to relinquishsovereignty in favour of principle of international trusteeship seems most impor-tant. If, in the meantime, it is necessary to deal, with criticism in UnitedStates public opinion, this is surely better done through existing information and propaganda channels.5. An agreed declaration on Colonial policy containing specific assurancesmust be an essential part of the declared war aims of the United Nations.Such a declaration would, apart from its intrinsic merit as a charter of colonial policy, be of cardinal importance for the proper conduct of political warfare inSouth-East Asia and Pacific region. So far our propaganda is necessarily of a negative character. We have little to offer as an alternative of the Japaneseco-prosperity sphere until such time as the Allied Nations reach definite under-standing on the fundamental principles which shall guide their future colonial policy and administration. We think that a full and frank exploration of thequestion with the United States administration is a necessary preliminary to sucha declaration, though we recognise a risk that such bilateral conversations maycreate suspicion, and give rise to misunderstanding with other Colonial Powers.6. In our view, the decision as to whether the declaration should be a joint anglo-American declaration, or whether the Netherlands and other colonial powers should be associated with it, could safely be left to the conclusion of theexploratory stage. It would be well to have in mincl, however, the fact that theColonial settlement will have an important bearing on general peace settlement,and that for that reason all leading members of the United Nations, and in fact
all Powers having overseas possessions, will be interested in the general lines ofthe contemplated declaration.7. As for the actual content of post-war Colonial policy, we confineourselves at this point to the following brief observations(a) There should be recognition that the administration of territories whichhave not yet attained self-government is a trust to be exercised in thefirst place in the interests of (and to the fullest possible degree in association with) the native inhabitants, and, in second place, in the promotion of the common welfare of the particular regional group asa whole, and, in the third place, in the interests of the other nations.(b) Parent States (a better term would be mandatory, guardian or trusteeStates) should accept the principle of accountability., for their trustto some International Colonial Commission operating throughmachinery analogous to the Permanent Mandate Commission which,on the whole, was regarded as successful.(c) There should be explicit acceptance of the principle that the Colonialpeoples should take part, to the fullest degree compatible with theirsocial and political development, in the Government both of their ownterritories and of the region in Avhich they live, trustee States to take immediate and practical steps to promote social, economic, andpolitical progress of such peoples, looking to the time when they will,each at the appropriate stage, undertake the full responsibilities ofself-government.(d) Exclusive economic rights in Colonial territories to be abandoned, and&quot;ready access t6&quot;their&quot;markets&quot;&quot;and&quot; raw materials to be open to allcountries.(e) Regional Colonial commissions, consisting of representatives of trusteeStates or other primarily interested States, including the dominions in their respective areas, and of native peoples who have reached or are approaching the stage of self-government, to be established. this body might be (i) regarded as the agent of the International ColonialCommission in matters pertaining to the implementation of agreedinternational policy, (ii) Co-operative and consultative for dealingwith questions of mutual concern to all the adjacent Colonies, and for promoting regional educational, social and economic standards.(/) Within this framework, and subject to the principles laid down in (a),(b), (c) and (d) above, responsibility for the administration of colonial territories to continue to be that of the trustee State with which ineach case the territory has been associated in the past, subject to peace treaty adjustments involving alterations of sovereignty in the interestsof general security.8. These observations are necessarily of the briefest character, and take no account at this stage either of the profound influence on Colonial development which would follow from application of the economic principles set out inArticle 7 of our respective mutual aid Agreements with the United States, or ofthe degree to which Colonial development will be subject to arrangements forgeneral international security. On this latter point we have not found it easy to follow the reasons for the special emphasis laid on Colonial defence in the suggestions conveyed in your telegram D No. 538. Colonial security would inevitably be a corollary of a general security system, and it would in our view be a mistake at this stage to anticipate one aspect of this system by seeking whatwould be tantamount to a guarantee of American participation in Colonialdefence.9. We should appreciate being informed of the views of the other DominionGovernments in reply to your telegram D. No. 538.Telegram from New Zealand Government (December 18. 1942).(No. 430.   Most Secret.)Your telegram D. No. 538.Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister : &quot; We are in general agreement with the point of view expressed inyour message concerning British Colonial policy. In view of the special experience of the Dominions, particularly their orderly evolution from
dependent to independent status, and their own experience with dependentpeoples, I am inclined to feel that the Dominions would have somethingmaterial to contribute to the consideration of this subject. I would suggesttherefore, that arrangements might be made for Dominion participation in\   the contemplated discussions on the application of the principles enunciated.Letter from High Commissioner for Union of South Africa [December 1(3, 1942).With reference to your telegram D. No. 538 of the 11th December, my PrimeMinister has telegraphed asking me to convey to you the following message : &quot; I am in general agreement with your suggested proposals for colonial policy to be submitted to the United States. These follow generally the lines in our discussion in London at which you, Cranborne and Law were present. The onlycomment I would make is that the idea of defence is too much stressed, as this might frighten the United States arictTEracke them think that while they have nocolonies themselves they are called in to defend the colonies of others. I would rest the case more on the Atlantic Charter as hereunder.&quot; There are two separate issues for us to meet. First, the prejudice created by Luce and Willkie against British colonial policy as being imperialistic andbased on selfish interests and repressive of colonial liberty, and, second, colonial policy in general. The first concerns us specially, although propaganda efforts should be made to disabuse Americans of a false outlook on British policy. Thesecond concerns all colonial Powers and calls for a declaration such as you proposeand for the participation of the United States in general colonial policies.&quot; Regarding the first, which concerns our domestic policy, I would suggest(1) that the multiplicity of small colonies should make way for larger unitsproperly grouped, with somewhat extended authority given to such units, (2) inrespect of each unit a development policy council to be constituted on which boththe unit and Colonial Office are i-epresented, as well as the Dominions more orless closely interested in the region concerned. Thus Canada will be on the west indies group unit, South Africa on the South and East Africa unit, whileAustralia and New Zealand would be on the Far East units. This will not onlybe hopeful in colonial development generally, but will negative the idea thatcolonies are run from Downing Street as private British interests. The principleof Empire partnership will also be clearly brought out, with fresh interest andpride in the Empire as a whole.&quot; Regarding general colonial policy the exclusive administration of the parent State is rightly emphasised, also the principle of regional councils whichwill supervise general development policies. They will consist of representativesof the parent States and regional groups concerned. The economic and securityprovisions of the Atlantic Charter and similar instruments for defence will,however, necessitate membership on these councils of one or other representativeof the Great Powers among the United Nations.&quot; Everywhere the question of strategic routes and bases arises as well as of control of raw materials for warlike or purely civilian use. For these andcognate purposes it will be necessary to give direct representation to the great power more intimately responsible for general security. In particular, theBritish Commonwealth would most cordially welcome the membership of theUnited States in all the (?) councils over regions including the British Colonies,such as the West Indies, Africa and the Far East. United Colonial Nations will,I believe, readily agree to such a council regime provided their exclusive adminis-tration as parent States is emphasised. Neutrals like Portugal and Spain willprobably like the idea less, but need it most.&quot; On the propaganda question I have, on the invitation of Luce, written astatement for Life in which the British Empire and Colonial Policy are defendedagainst recent attacks. For future reform, both as regards British Colonies andgeneral Colonial Policy indicated above, I have taken a line of thought whichmay prove helpful in preparing the American public for the constructive policywhich the United Kingdom Government may finally formulate. A copy of thestatement has been given to Harlech.&quot;Yours sincerely,(Signed)        SIDNEY F. WATERSON.
