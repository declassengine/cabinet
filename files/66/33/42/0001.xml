MOST secret from AdmiraltyC. in C. Mediterraneans 1252/4 not to N.C.X.F.  Giraudand de Gaulle have been in communication arid there may becontacts at a lower loyel.     We hope that the two Principalsmay meet towards the end of the month, but it is impossibleyet to predict whether the meeting will in fact be held or what will result from it-,      Past antagonism and present politicalrivalries have to be overcome and it may take some time toarrive at a settlement,,      We ourselves are trying to reach an agreed policy with the Americans as to- our future handling ofthis problem.2.      All previous reports have suggested that the introductionof de Gaulle info the North African administration vail be most unlikely to decide Goafroy to come over,  although no doubt itv/ould have an effect on his men.        Does C.  in G. Mediterranean&apos; s1254/4- mean that now Goaf roy would bring his ships over if ajoint Giraud-dc Gaulle administration is established?3.      It has not escaped our attention that(a) Godfrey has both sent and received messages incypher since the Germans entered Toulon.      Suchmessages from Franco can only be designed tostiffen Godfroyts attitude towards us.(b) The Axis have begun to put captured French -warships into service against us and this bringsinto operation Clause Eleven of the Agreement.4.      We cannot any longer tolerate the indefinitecontinuance of a situation in which we pay Godfroy to remainneutral,  responsible to no authority - unless it be to thetraitor Laval - and possessing full cypher facilities for communicating with enemy-occupied territory.      It is now almostinconceivable that the Squadron could be induced to attemptto reach any enemy occupied port or to initiate hostile actionagainst us at Alexandria.      Consequently,  a simple refusal tocarry out our side of the Agreement might be sound tactics since it would leave Godfrey without funds.      We cannot help feeling that these people have become lotus  eaters and need a jolt tobring them back to reality.5.      Withdrawal from the Agreement could be justified on the ground that:-(a) The total occupation of France,  by-putting an end to -all semblance of independent authority in France, hasdestroyed the basis of the Agreement.;(b) the employment by the Axis of French warships against us has brought ClauseEl even int. o pi ay&apos;?(c) continued use of W/T communication with enemy territory is an unfriendly act-6.      Another possibility might be to induce Giraudto order Godfrey to take his squadron to Dakar and relievehim of his command if he fails to obey-.

7.      We should, of course, prefer&apos; Go&amp;froy to take,even at this late stage,  the chance of an honourable solution which we have repeatedly put before him, but we must now considerthe alternatives.      Accordingly(a) C,  in G. Mediterranean is requested to comment generally on the above;(b) N.C.X.F,  is requested to report what he considers would be the effect of our withdrawal from the Agreement on Navalcircles in North Africa and to comment onpara.  6.8.      G. in G.. Mediterranean is also requested toinform Godfroy at once that we take a very serious view of hiscommunication in cypher with enemy controlled W/T stations.2305A/21,MOST SECRET 1521A/25th JanuaryINFrom N.C.X.F.Naval Cypher XP By W/T Reed.    1945Addressed.      Admiralty,.      Repeated C.  in 0r Mediterranean.IMPORTANT492Personal to be decyphered by an Officer detailed by you.Your 2305/21.      We are technically within our rights indenouncing agreement now that Germans have taken over French warships, but if we are to carry French naval opinion herealong with us,  it is of great importance to avoid.havingourselves to take over ships or oust Godfroy from command.2.      Suggest we should put Godfroy into position of refusingorders of bis - own superiors.      I v/ould suggest, therefore, thatI discuss question with Giraud and ask him to instruct Michelierto issue an order to Godfroy to take his squadron to Dakar.I have hopes of succeeding in this as French Navy were very dis-pleased when Godfroy refused Darlan1s similar proposal.3.      If Godfrey still refuses,   the fact should be made clear to the squadron together with interference that he apparentlyproposes to remain idle whilst the rest of French Navy fights.Much can be made of the agreement just signed to send RICHELIEUcruisers and destroyers to U.S.A.   to rearm at end of this month.If it is fher. necessary to supersede him there should not be great difficulty.      Name of de Gaulle should, be kept out of itat all costs owing to bitter feeling in French squadron against his supporters in Alexandria.

MOST SECRETIN2230/26th JanuaryProm C.  in C. Mediterranean Date 27-. 1.43.Reed-  04-59Addressed Admiralty IT.C.X.F.A. Your 2305/21st only received on 24th-      Saw Godfroyyesterday.B. Your para, eight Godfroy says only cypher messages that havebeen made were in the cypher that we hold ine. pre-armistice andhe knows we have decyphered some of them in the past.      Requestcheck of this statement.C. I told him re art.  two and your paras.  3 and 5.      He does not want to live on our charity and suggests that French money in neutral countries be unfrozen and sent to him,D. He assures me that he wishes to re --enter the fight but underbis own conditions which are.1.      To fight in the hediterrancan and not  spend ten months getting to and refitxirig in America.2.      He is reluctant to break his oath to Petain as longas he remains in power supported by a so called- legitimate government in France^      He would feelfree if Petain gave up or a qaisling governmentwas formed.3.      He will not join North Africa until a trulyrepresentative government of all Frenchmen outsidePrance has been formed.        He would not consider-any Government formed by Fighting French suitable.He has no objection to de Gaulle personally and would support a Giraud de Gaulle agreement providedthat none of his hated Fighting French communists weretacked on to it.      He stipulated too that theUnited Nations should give adequate guarantees to this government -E. Infuriating as the situation nay be the following facts mustbe faced.1.      If agreement is denounced under art,  2 and payment isstopped then force will be scuttled.      Is this to our advantage both vis a vis our own interests, german propaganda, North African feelings and the odd chance that before scuttling the pro Nazis may open fire onour vital interests in Alexandria.2.      If they seceded under pressure- what next, 1 could not recommend them being passed through the Canal withthe chance of their being scuttled in the Canal bytheir elements who already hate us and would thenhate us more. If passage of the Canal is not acceptable then they must remain in Alexandria drawingfull pay instead of one third pay till Tunisia iscleared up when they would go to North Africa, whichis what I think they would do anyhow provided politicalset up in North Africa is i ;asonableo       If the issue-must be forced which I do not repeat not recommend

for above reasons then I suggest denounce agreementsunder Art.  11.        Turn them over to North African-   Government under Art.  5 and leave it to Giraud ifpossible coupled with de Gaulle to order Godfroy to resume fight.      in this way we wash our handsof them and leave it to Giraud to relieve Godfreyand his Captains.ft     N.C.X.F.S.  1321 January 25.      This follows lines ofpara.  two.       As regards para.  3 last sentence I agree de Gaulleshould not be mentioned unless coupled with Giraud.2230B/26.
