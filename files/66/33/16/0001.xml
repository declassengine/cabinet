INDIA Copy No&quot;.PROPOSED REPLY TO MR. GANDHI TREATMENT IP HEUNDERTAKES A PAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State Tor India.I circulate Tor consideration by the War Cabinet theViceroys reply to my telegram No.27 of the 8th Januaryconveying the views of the War Cabinet.    The handling ofthis situation seems to me essentially a matter in whichthe responsibility is that of the man on the spot and inwhich we must be guided by his judgment.    In any case someanswer to Mr. gandhis letter is now a matter of someurgency.ij 4 q&apos;* xv.INDIA office.11th January 1943.TEJjEGRAM PROM VICEROY DATED 11th JixNIAiRY 1943.,SI-private and personal.&apos;  Your private and personal telegram January 8th, No.27, Gandhi,   i am grateful to cabinet for consideration they have given to this difficultbusinessv   I realise the importance they attach to it.&apos; butmy considered view after careful weighing of their pointsis that we should go ahead on the lines and in terms that Ioriginally recommended.   While I appreciate considerationsweighing with Cabinet they will not overlook that I have very close familiarity with Gandhi and his tactics;- that immediate responsibility for handling of the situationfalls on me; and that equally general position is one whichI have handled for a good many years.   Before putting forwardmy earlier recommendations, to which&apos;I adhere, I had giventhe fullest weight to possible alternatives.   I remain clearthat the draft and the course I have already recommended isthe right one..2.     On specific points:(a) I fully realise attitude of Cabinet towards lettingGandhi fast to death.   As you know I have myself had everysympathy with that course which I consistently pressed atearlier stages.    It was only in the light of Lumley1s views which have been before the Cabinet and which carriedconviction to me that however reluctantly I have had toadvise a different course.   Those views have the general support of the Governors and the full support of my HomeMember who has great experience.    I have again discussedsituation with Lumloy.   He reaffirms his earlier view, to

which I must attach great weight since he is my mostexperienced Governor and responsible for the province inwhich Gandhi is, that local reaction to letting Gandhi dieas a prisoner would be far more dangerous and ,far-reachingthan to his dying as a free man of his own choice,restraint having been removed.   Point assumes additionalimportance in view of grievous food shortage in Bombay and increased tenseness of atmosphere there.(b) To consider releasing Gandhi on the basis suggestedin your telegram 27 would in my judgment be impossible now that he has hinted at a fast.   It would be a great tacticalsuccess for Gandhi, and for us a humiliating surrender.It would leave us in a much weaker position for re-arrest-ing him if he started to give trouble again, and we shouldbe no further forward if he subsequently resorted to thisweapon.   And he is quite unpredictable: whether released ornot he is quite capable of fasting on any excuse that he thinks will be tactically sound.    On the other hand I see no difficulty about keeping him in prison until a fastendangers his health (though that would probably be only two or three days at the most after a fast began) and thensetting him free on health grounds.    I can arrange to make sure that he is not released until there is a real danger,if he is released when in immediate danger of death and thereafter recovers and starts to make himself a nuisanceagain I shall hrVe no hesitation in putting him back injail the moment he infringes the law.3.     Attitude of my Council is also relevant.    As already explained I am treating my present correspondence with gandhi as wholly personal and have not communicated it tothem.   No hint of it has therefore got out.   if Idefinitely put to them now the issue of letting Gandhifast and die at this stage news is bound to get out and a press agitation to develop thenceforward.    I wouldcertainly not anticipate united support and might very well have a majority against me.   Resignation of Hindus onsuch an issue would have most unfortunate effect and I doubt certain of them being willing to shelter behind factthat responsibility was mine.   They will probably be most difficult to handle and I shall be in a much better position to deal with them if I follow course I havealready indicated.4.     As regards terms of ray letter, it is based on closeacquaintance with working of Gandhi&apos;s mind and I attach great importance to its issuing as it stands, withoutstrengthening or modification.   Its object is to get himto show his hand, in which I hope, though I may be disappointed, that it will succeed.   Reliable report received since I telegraphed to you is to the effect thathe originally decided on a 21 days&apos;  fast from January 18thto February 8th but subsequently decided to send me a friendly letter.   My letter gives him no change?, but putsit on him to come back if he has further justification.Its second paragraph brings out quite sufficiently clearlyto Gandhi, who has had newspapers, my judgment of Congressresponsibility (his sensitiveness and that of hisentourage on this point is well illustrated by the factthat I have yesterday received a letter from Miss SIado,his companion in jail, protesting vigorously againstsuggestion in Indian and European and American Press that ghandi and/or Working Committee arc pro-Japanese, andsending documents designed to show that they a re not).

5. - If the Cabinet are in doubt over any point I hopethat they will let me know,&apos;but I repeat in the strongest,terms possible that my advice to them is that I should replyto Gandhi in terms of letter I have communicated to you,and with minimum of delay, and that we should consider thematter again when we receive reply.QOTWAHD TELEGRiJViprom secretary of State for India to Viceroy, dated&amp;th January 1943.27.private and personal.   Secret.   War cabinet considered last night both your revised proposals fordealing with Gandhi ii&apos; he should fast (your personal telegram 3566-S and Lumley1 s letters were before them),and your proposed reply to Gandhi&apos;s letter.They wished me to remind you that from the outsetit was understood that if Gandhi were detained he shouldnot be allowed to secure release by threat of a fast untodeath.    They attach great importance to preservingprinciple involved and if conditions are now such that hecould be released without serious risk they would prefer that he should be set at liberty on compassionate grounds,for example his age, health, and fact that he has alreadybeen detained for nearly six months and that the crisis haslessoned, rather than that ho should be able by fastingto obtain his release at any time.   They would be glad to have your views on this suggestion before any further action is taken and in the meantime desire that no replybe sent to Gandhi&apos;s letter to you.
