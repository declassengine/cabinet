IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot; WHAT ROOSEVELT&apos;8 OPPOSITION IS FIGHTING FOR.&quot;By Joseph W. Martin, Junior.Republican Leader in the House of Representatives.House of Representatives,Washington, Monday.A great British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, said, &quot; Without partyParliamentary government is impossible.&quot; His statement of the past pointsdirectly to the role of strengthening the Republican Party in the 78th Congress.,for it is to the Republican Party that falls the duty of restoring the prerogativesof America&apos;s Legislature the keystone of the people&apos;s faith in their government.But in accepting the challenge to preserve constitutional government andprotect our free Press and to rescue free enterprise from destruction -weRepublicans shall have first in our minds the winning of this greatest of wars,co-operating in this common cause with the full appreciation of the valour andsacrifices of the Allies : Britain, Russia, China and the host of nations whosevoung men share the world-scattered bivouacs.In winning the war there will be no partisan politics so far as the republicans are concerned. But like every Englishman we want victory in the shortest possible time; we want our boys and the English boys back home, back from their rendezvous with death, and home to share our responsibility in building nations of free men in free enterprise.Although the Republican Party will co-operate fully toward winning thewar, we will demand it fought with the utmost vigour, we will demand -that theUnited States effort be directed by men whose ability for the job at hand is thebasis of selection without partisan or personal favouritism.We Republicans are asked : &apos;&apos; What of the peace ?&apos;&apos; Our answer is thatit is clear that neither the United States nor the Republicans will dodge any responsibility of working toward a world which cannot again be thrownunwillingly into war&apos;s holocaust.We have both the n.ation&apos;s and the Party&apos;s interest in the world&apos;s future,which consists in the selfish necessity of protecting our national destiny, as wellas in the realisation of our obligations to all mankind.We shall not shrink from that responsibility, although we ai^e not, as a party, prepared right now to submit a programme. That will depend on future developments.President Roosevelt, in a recent message to Congress, spoke of the task ofmaking the United States free from want. We Republicans are naturallydesirous of improving economic conditions for all Americans. Thus we are interested in Britain&apos;s Beveridge Plan and feel it is an aid to us in our studiesto aid the common man.But though we put peace and security to the future and concentrate on thetask of defeating our enemies, it is with the assurance that the RepublicanParty will not neglect responsibilities in these fields, which will grow in importance as the United Nations armies progress along the road to Berlin andTokyo.While I write of peace I should like to say that the part American aviationis playing in breaking the Axis will be extended to preserving peace.We Republicans believe that the nation which is strongest in the air willbe most secure when peace comes. It is our belief that in addition to con-concentrating on the need for fighting airplanes the United States must also plan to take the lead in ruling the air in the post-war world ruling in the sense that our&apos; airplanes must bridge all seas, all continents and isles, and that ourtechnical progress and building capacity must be supreme.To do this we will demand the Standing Committee of the House to dealwith post-war aviation problems.The Englishman, Canadian and American find taxes onerous, though theypay cheerfully. The Republican Party has t!he dual job of watching that taxesdo not destroy initiative and that they are expended without  waste and[24899]&apos;
extravagance. To do the first we will seek to bring a better-planned but moreequitable tax programme, not denying the high taxes necessary but insistingthat they must not be punitive.Peace is indelibly tied up with the problem of taxes. The government after the war must bring prosperity to the people. That must be the chiefgoal, whether in the United States, in Britain or in China:To accomplish this a wise tax system is essential; through it we will promoteour fixed policy of constructing a better civilisation on the base of ever-growincprivate enterprise.Because of this link between tax reform and of peace and prosperity notonly for the United States but for the whole world as well there is no necessity to delay tax reform, until after the wax. The benefits of a better system will ripenwith its adoption.War is no excuse for waste and extravagance. Our party will not slackenits demands that Government spending which is not essential to the war must bereduced.Unnecessary Government work not only uses the money of the heavilyburdened taxpayers, it keeps many men and women at useless tasks when theycould be producing war material.If every third civil servant were released it would provide a welcome additionto the war labour force, already facing a serious shortage of man-power. and better wages could be paid to those remaining.In outlining these principles of our opposition, an opposition whosetraditional right to oppose is transcended in the common cause of all parties-co-operation toward the single-minded purpose of victory- we Republicansbelieve we have the job of saving the American way of life; that way of livingwhich has its roots in Britain is not only the United States&apos; greatest possession,it is an inspiration to all the world.To continue it. we Republicans insist on making war efficiently with soundgovernment in which Congress both demands and fulfils its constitutional role.7
