NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   Three U-boats have been sunk- and others have been damaged.A convoy of laden tankers has been heavily attacked by U-boats in the north atlantic: convoys have also been attacked by U-boats in the West Atlantic and by aircraft in the Mediterranean. Shipping losses in consequence have been heavy.The Scharnhorst has been sighted in the Skagerrak.Northern Waters.&apos;2. H.M. Minesweeper Bramble is now presumed to have been sunk duringthe action on the 31st December. The two ships which were unaccounted for inthe convoy from the United Kingdom have reached North Russia.Home Waters and North Atlantic.3.   H.M.S. Hunter (escort aircraft-carrier) commissioned on the 9th.A Heinkel 111 was destroyed by H.M. minesweepers and small craft offLowestoft on the 11th.Mediterranean.4. A convoy of five ships, including a tanker, arrived at Malta from alexandria on the 11th.HAL Destroyers Kelvin and Nubian sank three schooners of 100-200 tonsoff the east coast of Tunisia on the night of the 8th/9th.ELM. Submarine Tribune torpedoed a 6.000-ton ship, which subsequentlywent aground, off the east coast of Sardinia on the 11th.Naval aircraft attacked shipping in the Gulf of Bizerta and probably hit a ship of 7,000 tons.South-West Pacific.5. H.M. New Zealand Cruiser Achilles was damaged by dive-bombing whileretiring from a bombardment of Munda (Solomons) with a U.S. Task Force onthe 5th.6. A force of Japanese destroyers was attacked, on the night of the10th/11th, by U.S. M.T.Bs. off Guadalcanal- Two destroyers were torpedoed and a third possibly torpedoed.   The enemy retired to the north-west.Anti-Submarine Operations. *7. H.M. Canadian Corvette Vllle de Quebec, while escorting a convoy,rammed and sank a German U-boat on the 13th west of Algiers. One survivorwas taken prisoner.U.S. aircraft sank one U-boat, and possibly a second, off the coast of Brazilon the 6th.Twelve other.attacks are reported to have been carried out during&apos; the week;six of them by surface craft and six by aircraft- These are exclusive of attacksmade south of the Azores by the escorts of a tanker convoy, which are thought tohave damaged at least four U-boats.Belated reports have been received that a Japanese U-boat was sunk by theU.S. Submarine Wahoo north of Bougainville (Solomons) on the 14th December,and that a U.S. naval aircraft obtained a direct hit on a U^-boat off Rekata inthe Solomons.Enemy Intelligence.German.8. The Scharnhorst and a cruiser, probably the Prim Eugen, with a destroyer in company, were sighted by aircraft in the Skagerrak on the 11thsteering a westerly course. Except for the Admiral Scheer, the Graf Zeppelinand the 8-inch Cruiser Seydlitz (now dismantled), the whole German fleet isthought to be active.There have been indications of a surface raider in the Cape area.
U-Boats.9. Heavy concentrations of U-boats are believed to have been formed west of Rockall and also to the east of Newfoundland. It is estimated that the totalnumber operating in the Atlantic remains between 90 and 100.As many as ten probably took part in the attacks on a tanker convoysouth-west of the Azores-There has been little activity in the Caribbean and there are still no indica-tions of U-boats south of the latitude of Ascension.protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the lOth/Tlth. 678 ships have been convoyed.Of these 53 were in ocean convoys and 625 in British coastal convoys. Oneauxiliary aircraft-carrier, 65 destroyers (including eight U.S. destroyers), and70 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including three U.S. cutters), were employed on escort duties.11. During the month of December. 305 ships in 11 ocean convoys arrived in the United Kingdom or Iceland (C) without loss; and three homeward bound convoys, consisting of 101 ships, lost three ships and one straggler by enemy action. Ten outward ocean convoys, of 232 ships, arrived at their destinationswithout loss; and three outward convoys, of 126 ships, lost two ships and threestragglers by enemy action. In addition, four were lost from two convoys after having been detached. In the Western Atlantic and Caribbean, 1,710 ships, in151 convoys, were escorted to their destinations without loss.12. Imports into the United Kingdom by. ships in convoy during the weekending the 9th totalled 621.000 tons, compared with 351.000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 510,900 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports 210,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping&quot;.13. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked 13 ships, ofwhich 12 are known or presumed to have been sunk.Six ships were sunk in repeated attacks on a convoy of laden tankers boundfrom the West Indies to Gibraltar. Four U.S. ships, including a tanker, in convoy from Trinidad to Baia (Bahia), were sunk off the coast of Dutch Guiana.A straggler from a homeward bound convoy from Canada was sunk in the N.W.Approaches, one ship was sunk south of the Azores, and one was torpedoed offthe N.E. coast of Brazil. Two ships were sunk and one damaged in bombing attacks on an eastbound convoy N.W. of Bone. A British tanker was damaged by aircraft in the entrance to Murmansk, and one ship was damaged by dive-bombers off the coast of New Guinea.Two Swedish ships, bound from Gothenburg for Buenos Aires, were sunk,probably by mine, in the North Sea.14. Shipping losses, of all tonnages, from enemy action during December,as recorded to date, were approximately 307,000 tons, which was the lowestmonthly total for 1942. Of this total 295,000 tons, or about 96 per cent., wereclue to U-boats. E-boats caused the loss of 7,500 tons, and only 4,000 tons was due to aircraft attack.Compared with November, the losses in the North and South Atlantic weredown by more than 50 per cent., and the tonnage lost in the Indian Ocean fellfrom 91,000 tons to 24,000 tons. There was also a slight decrease in theMediterranean from 45,000 to 33,000 tons.The greater part of the losses occurred in the North Atlantic to the north ofthe Azores, where heavy U-boat attacks were made on convoys. U-boats were also active between Trinidad and the north-east of Brazil. Attacks by aircraft were mainly on shipping in and approaching North African ports.Five tankers, of which two were British, two Norwegian, and one Belgian,were lost during the month.British Minelaying.15.   Surface craft have laid mines off the north coast of France.Aircraft, including naval Swordfish, have laid mines off the German and norwegian North Sea Coasts, in the Baltic, off the Biscay ports and in theGhannel.Mines have been laid in the Mediterranean both by surface craft and by aircraft, including naval Albacores.
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. An enemy minefield is believed to have been laid in the North Sea about120 miles N.W. of the Naze to the southernmost point of Norway, in the routedeclared &quot; safe &quot; to Swedish shipping.No mines have been destroyed during the week in Home Waters.The mine totals are : 2,751 magnetic; 1.326 acoustic; 2,044 moored.Foreign Waters.17. E-boats mined the approach channel to Bone and are also suspected ofminelaying in the Gulf of Bone. The approach channel, in which ten moored mines were swept, has now been cleared.French Intelligence.18. The French naval authorities in North and West Africa are now provingco-operative and are meeting our requirements in shipping.In harbour at Dakar there are 29 ships, totalling 126,172 tons, including one british, two Norwegian and one Yugoslav. Some ships which have been in theport for a long period require overhauling, and. as only one dry-dock is available at present, several months may elapse before they can be rendered fit for sea.Enemy Merchant Shipping.19. Allied survivors from the German blockade-runner Rhakotis, which was sunk on the 1st, state that the following ships are bound from the Far East toBiscay ports: A German tanker, possibly the Uckermark (7.021 tons); twoex-Norwegian tankers, the Herborg (7,892&quot;tons) and the Madrono (5,894 tons);the Doggerbank (5.154 tons) (ex-British Speybank); an unspecified 10-knot ship;and possibly the German Regensburg (8,068 tons).MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included inthis Resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Central Sector.20. The Russian General Staff has confirmed the capture of Velikie Luki.There are strong indications, however, that an isolated German garrison is still holding out in or near the town, and German attacks south-west of Velikie Lukiappear to be aimed at the relief of this force.Stalingrad Sector.21. East of the Don bend the Russians are increasing their pressure againstthe encircled German Sixth Army, which continues to receive some supplies by air. Although the Germans have been mainly on the defensive, they have in thepast made some abortive attempts to break out in different directions.Don Sector.22. The Russian thrust from the north remains stationary in the Millerovoarea, though there are indications that the Russians may now be attempting to resume their advance there.In a series of thrusts from the east, however, the Russians have made rapid progress on a wide front. Their right flank, advancing along the railwayStalingrad-Likhaya beyond Morozovskaya, is now approaching Tatsinskaya,which the Germans appear earlier to have recaptured. Their centre, advancingastride the Lower Don, has reached to within some 50 miles of Rostov. Theirleft flank, continuing its advance south-westward astride the railway Stalingrad-Tikhoretsk and westward across the Kalmuk Steppe, is approaching the general line of the River Munich.Caucasus Sector.23. The Russians, following up the German retirement north-westwardfrom the Terek Sector on a wide front astride the main railway Baku-Rostov,have reached and now hold the lateral line Buclyonovsk-Mineralnie Vodi-Kislovodsk. It is reliably reported that the Germans have suffered heavy losses,both of men and material, in their withdrawal, and that they are having a badtime, especially in the foothills.
Summary.24. The Russian offensive in the Don area has now been maintained fora period of some seven to eight weeks on a 200-mile front, with a penetration atone point to a depth of 180 miles,, and over a terrain very short of communications.For supply reasons alone, therefore, a pause would not be unexpected. Inaddition, the Germans may be expected to make a very determined effort to hold the approaches to Rostov, and it would not be surprising if they were now toattempt counter-thrusts to reduce the imminent threat-both to that town and toSalsk.Meanwhile, by shortening their line in Northern Caucasia and withdrawingpart of their forces, the Germans hope no doubt to be able to reinforce the Donfront. There is no evidence that they are yet contemplating a total withdrawal from Northern Caucasia.Tunisia.25. In the Northern Sector activity has been, confined to patrolling and artillery duels.Further south in the Central Sector there have been several clashes with enemy patrols, and contact with the enemy has been maintained principally inthe areas of Ffeiclous and Bou Arada.To the south the French detachment at Pichon successfully repelled two enemy raids on the 8th and 9th. The first of these raids was supported by a fewtanks, some of which were destroyed. Fondouk is reported to have changedhands twice during the last few days and a further small-scale attack by theenemy on the 11th was successfully repulsed.In the extreme south of Tunisia irregular detachments of the Fi^ench NativeCamel Corps on the 7th - captured an Axis strong point not far from theTripolitanian border. An Axis attempt on the 11th to retake the post wasrepulsed with the loss of three German guns.Libya.26. Improved weather conditions were accompanied by an increase -ofpatrol activity on both sides. The Northern Sector of the Axis position has remained quiet, but considerable activity has been observed from Gheddahiato&apos; the south. Enemy patrols and a considerable quantity of enemy M.T. arestill in evidence south-west of the Gheddahia-Bu Ngem track in the area ofWadi Umm Er Raml. The Eighth Army continued to concentrate in front ofthe Buerat position.The Fezzan.27. The Fighting French force which has been advancing northwardsfrom Zouar, and is at present operating in the Fezzan, has now captured allthe main enemy outposts in that area. Umm El Araner surrendered on the 4th,Mourzouk on the 7th, and Sebha and Braak on the 8th. Mopping up of the few remaining&apos; small posts is proceeding and over 500 Italian prisoners, togetherwith a large number of native troops and material, have been captured.Burma.28. Our forces are continuing their advance clown the Arakan coast eastand west of the Mayu River. On the west they have now reached a pointnine miles from Akyab Island, where there have been some minor engagements.On the east no advance has been made during the past week and our forward troops are still some 20 miles north of Akyab Island.In the Chin Hills and the&apos;Northern Assam /Burma Frontier, patrols havebeen active and some minor skirmishes have taken place.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.29. Allied troops have occupied Tarakena, a village on the coast two miles south-west of Sanananda. Operations have been slowed down by heavy rainwhich has been falling during the last few days.
AIR SITUATION,General Review.32.   Objectives in France were raided in daylight.Essen was bombed on five nights.Enemy shipping in the South-West Pacific was again heavily attacked.United Kingdom.33. Enemy activity against this country showed a slight increase over theprevious week and by day 33 aircraft were reported overland. Fighters and A.A.fire accounted for two, three others were probably destroyed and one was damaged.At night only one small raid was made in the Sunderland area.Enemy and Occupied Territory.Day.34. On the 13th, large-scale offensive operations were carried out, in goodweather conditions, by aircraft of Fighter and Bomber Commands and, theU.S. VIII Bomber Command.   The principal targets were :  (a) The Fives-Lille Steel and Engineering Works, which were attacked by72 U.S. Fortresses (B. 17), and(b) Airfields at St. order and Abbeville, which were attacked by 12 Bostons(A. 20) and 18 Venturas (B. 34) respectively.The bombers were escorted and. supported by 30 squadrons of Spitfires(including six U.S. squadrons), and as a diversion 16 U.S. Liberators (B. 24)carried out an uneventful sweep in the Flushing area.About 145 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped on the Fives-Lille Works, burstsbeing seen on buildings and in the railway yard. The airfields were also success-fully bombed, hits being obtained, on the dispersal areas.In combat, our fighters destroyed three enemy aircraft and damaged threeothers without loss to themselves. The Fortresses, three of which are missing,destroyed three and damaged nine.On the same day, Typhoons of Fighter Command, two of which are missing,attacked canal barges and gun positions in Holland, and Mosquitoes of bomber command bombed railway yards, locomotive sheds and repair shops in northern france.Among targets attacked on other days of the week were the Ijmuiden Ironand Steel Works, on which nine tons of H.E. bombs were dropped by Venturas.Photographs were taken and the results are given in Appendix VI.&quot; successful attacks were also made on railway centres and canals in Northern France andthe Low Countries. At Rouen a large railway building was set on fire and it isbelieved that the engine sheds were hit.Night.35. Essen was attacked on five nights during the week by a total of14 Mosquitoes and 215 Lancasters of Bomber Command; about 650 tons of H.E.and incendiaries were dropped.Successful blind-bombing operations were carried out on four nights againstEssen; but about 75 per cent, of the aircraft despatched attacked the target.On the fifth night, visibility Avas clear and bombs were seen to burst in the town;a large concentration of fires was developing as the aircraft left. Intense flakwas encountered and searchlights were active in large numbers.Intelligence.Timor.30. The Japanese strength in Portuguese Timor is now estimated at15,000 men and in Dutch Timor at 3,000-5,000^ This represents an increase of3.000-5,000 on the whole island, making a total of 18,000-20,000.Japanese Casualties in 1942.31. We believe the Japanese Army losses in 1942 were about 40,000 killed and 138,000 wounded.   This is, of course, a very rough and provisional estimate.
Duisburg was also bombed in thick cloud, 112 tons of HE. and incendiary bombs being dropped on the town.Aircraft of Fighter, Bomber and Army Co-operation Commands droppedleaflets on Paris and towns in Northern France.From all these operations 12 Lancasters are missing and one crashed in thiscountry.Coastal Operations.36. Eight Hudsons of Coastal Command attacked a northbound convoy of16 ships off the Dutch coast. Two ships of about 3,000 tons were hit, and another of 2,000 tons was probably hit.A naval Albacore bombed three small vessels off Calais, but no hits were claimed.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 237 were despatched, laid 442 sea-mines in enemy waters.   Mines were also laid by naval Albacores.Mediterranean.French North A frica.37. Bombing attacks on Axis Tunisian ports were curtailed by unfavourable weather conditions. A strong force of U.S. Fortresses (B. 17), with an escort ofLightnings (P. 38), successfully bombed Bizerta and Ferryville, and two smallerraids were made on Tunis by U.S. Liberators (B. 24) from Libya. Wellingtonsbased at Malta twice attacked Sousse Harbour by night and obtained hits on thequays and started some fires; during one of these raids a large stationary ship was attacked and a small fire started. A damaged ship between Sicily and Tunis was destroyed by U.S. Mitchells (B. 25).A series of attacks was made by escorted U.S. light bombers on enemy com-munications and military targets on the west coast of Tunisia. The railway centre at Gabes and a junction west of Sousse were successfully bombed; two, andpossibly three, railway bridges at Graiba (35 miles S.W. of Sfax) were destroyed;a road bridge north of Sfax was hit, about 100 yards of railway line west ofKairouan was demolished, and a ravine in the same area was bombed by hurricanes.Enemy tanks, troops and airfields were bombed at Gabes and Kairouan, and amilitary camp at Kebili (65 miles S.W. of Gabes) was attacked from a low level.A U.S. Warhawk (P. 40) claimed to have destroyed an hotel at Kairouan used asa German H.Q. As a result of these operations the enemy and ourselves each lost10 aircraft.Successful offensive operations against enemy M.T. on the western Tunisianroads were carried out at night by Bisleys, and by Mosquitoes from Malta; largenumbers of vehicles were destroyed and damaged. On the 7th a U.S.Lightning (P. 38) reported a general westward movement of troops and M.T.the whole distance from Tripoli to Mendinini.Enemy attacks were not on a heavy scale and were mostly carried out byformations not exceeding 10 aircraft. Two raids were made on Bone, but only afew aircraft succeeded in reaching the target and of these six were shot down.Thelepte (Feriana) airfield was twice attacked and two of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground. A more determined raid was, however, made on Biskraairfield by eight Ju. 88s, resulting in three U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) and two other aircraft being destroyed or seriously damaged, and nine other aircraft slightly damaged.Allied aircraft flew a total of 2,073 sorties, and an additional 555 sorties were made by transport aircraft.Libya.38. Night attacks were made by our heavy and medium bombers on roadjunctions and other targets in the Tripoli area; these operations were supportedby AVellingtons from Malta. Military installations and roads also were effectivelybombed in the Horns and Misurata areas.Fighter-bombers made two daylight bombing attacks on dispersed M.T.in. Wadi Zemzem and Wadi Umm Er Raml, the results of which are believed to have been good.On the 12th, 12 U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) from French North Africa escorted by TJ.S. Lightnings (P. 38) bombed Castel Benito airfield (near Tripoli) and hit
hangars and claimed to have destroyed 20 enemy aircraft on the ground; in combat the bombers destroyed 14 Mc. 109s.On the 13th a formation of Baltimores (A. 30) with fighter escort were unable to locate Birdufan landing ground owing to dust storms and bombed acamp. They were attacked by Me. 109s. three of which were destroyed; our casualties were six fighters and one Baltimore (A. 30).Enemy fighter-bombers on four days carried out harassing attacks on ourlanding grounds on the Tamet and Bir er Ziclen areas. They suffered considerablelosses in combat with our fighters. At night, raids were made by three to fiveaircraft on the harbours of Benghazi and Tohruk. In these operations enemy casualties were 18 destroyed, 11 probably destroyed, 16 damaged and our losses were three Spitfires of which the pilots were saved.Southern Italy, Sicily and the Sicilian Channel.39. Spitfires and Mosquitoes from Malta carried out offensive patrols,intruder operations and sweeps over Sicily, Pantelleria, Tunis and Tripoli.Four attacks were made on Lampedusa airfield by escorted Spitfires with bombs and Comiso and Gela airfields in Sicily were also attacked. A number ofhits with 250-lb. bombs was made on the Licata Sulphur Factory and on the harbour installations at Sciacca (South-West Sicily).LT.S. Liberators (B. 24) from Libya bombed the harbours at Palermo andNaples. Weather conditions were not favourable and although some fires were started it was not possible to observe detailed results; two Liberators (B. 24)were missing.Burma.40. Allied aircraft made several successful attacks on Rathedaung andAkyab, on the airfield near Akyab, on enemy-occupied villages in that area andon two steamers and several small craft off Ramree and Cheduba Islands.In Central Burma, attacks were mainly directed against railways convergingon Mandalay. The Myitnge bridge near that town received at least three direct hits; two railway engines were destroyed and considerable damage was caused to goods trains, buildings and tracks. Attacks were also made on small craft onthe Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers.In the East of Burma, IJ.S. aircraft, operating from China, successfully attacked Moulmein clocks, warehouses and barges at Bhamo and trucks carryingtroops north-east of Lashio.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.41. Allied aircraft renewed their attacks on the enemy convoy referred to inparagraph 47 of last week&apos;s Resume. Only three transports with escorts succeeded in reaching Lae. On the 8th they were heavily bombed; one transport was hit andbeached and another was damaged. Landing craft were also heavily attacked,and it is. believed that only a small fraction of the troops which left Rabaullanded safely at Lae. It is reported that two further transports had joined theremains of the convoy at Lae. The beached transport was destroyed by aircraft on the morning of the 9th. Three ships retired and proceeded towards Gasmata.These ships were again attacked by aircraft on the following night when offthe south coast of New Britain; one was set on fire and a second was possiblytorpedoed. Since the attack on the convoy began, 59 enemy aircraft have been shot down and 22 damaged.Heavy attacks were also made on Lae airfield and on supply dumps on thebeach. At least eight enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. SixteenKittyhawks (P. 40) which were despatched to attack Lae airfield were inter-cepted by 18 enemy fighters, of which 13 were destroyed, and three probably destroyed for the loss of one Kittyhawk.Other targets attacked include the airfield at Madang, and huts and buildings at Finschafen and in the Salamoa area.Three Hudsons bombed and sank a Japanese torpedo boat off the KaiIslands.Enemy bombers attacked and damaged a Dutch ship in Oro Bay (20 miles.E. of Buna).
Timor.42. Beaufighters successfully attacked buildings, M.T. and aircraft on theground at Fuiloro airfield and buildings on the Baucau-become Road.Russia.43. In the far North, small-scale raids have been made against Murmansktown and harbour and against the railway.In the Stalingrad area activity by enemy transport aircraft continued. Itis probable, however, that the speed of the Russian advance is forcing the enemy to operate under conditions which are bound to increase losses and have an adverse effect on serviceability, which is thought to be already low.Sporadic enemy bombing has taken place against Black Sea ports, and itwould appear that in the whole Caucasian area the enemy is only able to mounta very small scale of effort. The Russians claim to have sunk a 5^000-ton ship ina Black Sea port.During the week ending the 9th, the Russians claim to have destroyed313 German aircraft m the air and on the ground. Their losses are statedto be 93.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.44. Daylight attacks have been made on five days of the week on eastern,southern and south-western coastal districts. Little damage of , national importance was clone, but house property was damaged and utility servicesaffected at Torquay on the 8th, at Teignmouth on the 10th, at Maldon on the 11thand at Winchelsea on the 13th. Bombs were dropped on only one night, the13th/14th, and caused some damage in Sunderlancl and other places in durham and Northumberland.Casualties.45. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours onthe 13th were 44 killed and 24 seriously injured.
