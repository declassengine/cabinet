THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEMTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET. Copy No.w.p. (43) 29.January 15, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE REFORM OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE.Report by the Committee.ON the 3rd December, the War Cabinet* considered a draft White Paper(W.P. (42) 538) summarising the proposals of the.Secretary of State for Foreign&quot;Affairs for the reform of the Foreign Service, together with memoranda by anumber of Ministers criticising certain of these proposals. The Cabinet directed that the terms of the draft White Paper should be considered by a Committee,the composition of which would be settled by the Prime Minister afterconsultation with the Foreign Secretary.2.   The Committee was duly constituted as follows :  The Deputy Prime Minister (Chairman)).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Chancellor.The President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.With the concurrence of the Committee, the Secretary of State for the home department, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary to theDepartment of Overseas Trade have also taken part in some of our discussions.3. I attach a revise of the white Paper which gives effect to the amendments which we propose, but it may be convenient to summarise the main conclusions which we reached.4. We recognised that there would be considerable difficulties at this stage in proposing any major changes in the basis of the scheme which had beenapproved by the Cabinet two years ago (W.M. (41) 56th Conclusions) and on whichstatements had already been made in Parliament. At the same time, we felt it only right to give full consideration to the major criticisms which had been made when the White Paper was considered by the Cabinet last month.5. Perhaps the most far-reaching suggestions were those put forward bythe Home Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer for securing some measure of interchangeability between the Foreign and Home Services (see.P. (42) 554 and 560), and the proposal of the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster that there should be a separate Eastern and Western Foreign Service(W.P. (42) 551).   On these two questions our conclusions were as follows : (a) Full interchangeability between the Home and Foreign Services was,having regard to the different requirements of the two Services,impracticable. At the same time, we felt that provision should bemade for appointing to Foreign Service posts, in exceptional cases,Home Service officers or candidates outside the Government Servicewho had outstanding qualifications. We also felt that it might go some way to meet the criticism that members of the Foreign service were apt to lose touch with opinion in this country owing to their* W.M. (4-2) 164th Conclusions, Minute 4.[24920]
prolonged service abroad, if opportunities were provided for attachingthem for periodic tours of duty in certain departments of the home service. In paragraph 23 of the White Paper as now amended wordshave been introduced to give effect to both these conclusions.(b) On the other proposal we were of the opinion that a rigid separation into an Eastern and a Western Service was to be avoided, and that theright way to meet some of the difficulties to which the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster had drawn attention was to ensure in thefuture combined Service an adequate supply of men with specialistknowledge of Eastern countries and of Eastern problems and toprovide a closer contact between the Foreign and Colonial Services.6. We also considered the question of representation of the Board of Tradeand the Department of Overseas Trade on the Promotions Board when higherappointments to the Commercial Diplomatic Service were under consideration,a matter to which attention had been drawn by the President of the Board ofTrade (W.P. (42) 542). The White Paper has been amended in paragraph 28 soas to give effect to the principal suggestion made by the President.7. The Committee were unable to concur in two points made by theChancellor of the Exchequer in his memorandum W.P. (42) 560. In paragraph of his memorandum the Chancellor had suggested that paragraph 13 of theWhite Paper should be amended so as to leave open the question of the salariesto be paid to members of the Foreign Service when employed at home. Havingregard to the paramount need of ensuring the greatest amount of flexibility inthe new combined Foreign Service, we were of the opinion that there should bean assimilation of the salaries for men of similar rank whether employed at home or abroad. The Chancellor&apos;s second objection was to the proposed announcementat this stage in paragraph 30 of the White Paper of the introduction after thewar of a further Foreign Service Superannuation Bill. The Committee took theview that such an announcement was essential.8. Certain other- amendments to the White Paper of a less important:character have been made. I should, however, draw attention to the announce-ment in paragraph 6 of the White Paper about the immediate fusion of the diplomatic, Commercial Diplomatic and Consular Services.Signed on behalf of the Committee :C.

PROPOSALS FOR THE REFORM OP THEFOREIGN SERVICE.INTRODUCTION.IN a statement in the House of Commons on ihc 11th June, 1941, theSecretary of State &apos; for Foreign Affairs announced the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce a series of reforms, designed tocreate a combined Foreign Service distinct from the Home Civil Service, tobroaden the field of entry into the new Service, and to increase its efficiencyby facilitating the retirement on pension of men who prove unfitted for thehighest posts. Reforms so wide in their scope cannot all be operative until after the war. Nevertheless, the interest of Parliament in the proposedreforms lias been great, and it has been decided to submit an outlinenecessarily incomplete and liable to modification in detail, of the proposalsfor a new Foreign Service and, in particular, to seek forthwith Parliamentsapproval of a Pensions Bill for the purpose to which the Foreign Secretaryalluded in his statement.&apos;2. Among the criticisms which have been brought against the diplomatic service the view has been expressed that it is recruited from too small acircle, that it lends to represent the interests of certain sections of thenation rather than those of the country as a whole, that its members leadtop sheltered a life, that they have insufficient understanding of economicand social questions, that the extent of their experience is too small toenable them properly to understand many of the problems with which thevought to deal, and that the range of their contacts is too limited to allow them to acquire more than a relatively narrow acquaintance with the foreignpeoples amongst whom they live.3. These criticisms are often overstated and some of them have their origin in a misunderstanding of the functions of the Diplomatic Service.These functions are, broadly, to represent His Majesty&apos;s Government inforeign countries and to be their channei of communication with foreign government; to protect British interests and to promote good relationswith foreign countries. The diplomat must be able to keep His Majesty&apos;?Government informed of developments which may affect their foreign policy,submitting his observations and advice, which may or may not be acceptedWhile a diplomat may therefore be able to influence foreign policy by hisreports, he does not finally determine it. That is the task of the CabinetThe art of diplomacy consists in making the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, whatever it may be, understood and, if possible, accepted by othercountries. The success or failure of our foreign policy should not therefonbe attributed to the Diplomatic Service alone.4. It is, however, true that the conditions which the Diplomatic Serviceoriginally grew up to meet no longer exist unchanged in modern international affairs. Economics and finance have become inextricably interwoven with!politics; an understanding of social problems and labour movements i^jindispensable in forming a properly balanced judgment of world eyei^ssThe modern diplomat should have a more intimate understanding of k?.Mspecial problems and greater opportunities to study them than he liasusually possessed in the past. His training and experience must be wider!By introducing the reforms hereinafter described it is intended to re-equiffl
ll Foreign Service to meet modern conditions and to create a Servicediich by its composition, by the recruitment and training of its membersd by its organisation, shall be better able not merely to represent the? ipvests of the nation as a whole, but also to deal with the whole range of&apos; ternational affairs, political, social and economic, and so constitute an&quot;dequate instrument for the maintenance of good relations and mutual understanding between the United Kingdom and other countries.y It is a fact, too, that the efficiency of the Foreign Service has suffered. the past from the lack of flexibility which arises from the disparity in conditions of service as between posts at home and posts abroad. Conditionsof service in the Foreign Office have been assimilated to those of the FlomeCivil Service. Members of the Diplomatic Service who are posted abroad, onthe other hand, have been treated on a different basis in regard to conditions0f service, pension rights, ivc. The Secretary of State has not been free, innracticc, -to move a man from a Mission abroad to a post in the ForeignOffice without consideration of the effect which such a transfer might haveupon the individual concerned. The efficiency of the Service has undoubtedlysuffered in consequence. The new combined Foreign Service, accordingly,will be entirely separated from the Home Civil Service and will be treatedas a self-contained and distinct service of the Crown.6. The present distinction between the Foreign Office and diplomatic service, the Commercial Diplomatic Service and the Consular Service will disappear and the three branches will be amalgamated in the new foreign service. This amalgamation will take place immediately. So far as is practicable, exchange of personnel will be effected between the threebranches, but, as present memBers of the Diplomatic Service have not been trained in commercial and consular affairs and vice versa, it is not in thenational interest that posts in the three branches of the Service should atonee become completely interchangeable in practice. It will not be&apos; untilnew entrants have received the training necessary to fit them for all threetypes of post that amalgamation will become complete. It might, moreover,he difficult to justify compelling members of the present Services to accept,against their will, posts in a Service other than that which they joined. all future entrants will join a combined Foreign Service and all will receivesimilar training, not merely in languages and history, but also in economicand commercial, affairs. The system of recruitment will be recast so as tofacilitate the entry, from any social sphere, of candidates with suitablequalifications by enabling them to obtain the necessary vocational training at the expense of the State. Uniformity of career for all will be impossibleand is, indeed, undesirable, for some officers will prove more fitted for workin the Foreign Office and in diplomatic posts and others for commercial orconsular work. What is aimed at is wider training and equality of opportunity for all. Every officer of the combined Service will be calledupon to serve in consular and commercial diplomatic as well as in diplomaticposts and in the Foreign Office and will have the opportunity of rising tothe highest posts. Interchange between the different branches, and betweenposts at home and those abroad, will be facilitated with the object of givingevery man as wide an experience as possible and of enabling the best manto be sent to any vacant post. This will involve some adjustment of thepresent disproportion in the numbers of the diplomatic and consular posts and a regradirig of certain posts at home and abroad.7. The effects of the new system of recruitment and training which[r Contemplated will not, of course, be felt for some years after its introduction. On the cessation of hostilities, however, the new service will be faced with a problem which will demand an immediate solution.
For a number of years there will have, been no new entry.   At tlof the Service there will be men who have stayed at their posts dufm&apos;the war against their inclination and who will wish to retire to makroom for younger men. The Foreign Service will be. understaffed whilethe tasks which face it will have multiplied. It will be necessarytherefore, to make special arrangements for recruitment pendiri&quot; tin!introduction of the new systein of recruitment and (raining described below. A scheme of special entry to meet the demands of the service during the reconstruction period immediately after the war is now beinoworked out. It is probable thai this scheme will be based primarily on the candidate^ record of service during the war and on his showing before aninterviewing board rather than, on a written examination or academicqualifications. It will be desirable, too, that the scheme should cover&apos; asfar as possible, those age groups which, but for the war, would have becnrepresented in the Service to-day.8. The proposed reforms woidd be incomplete and perhaps ineffectiveif they did not extend to the subordinate ranks upon whom the efficientperformance of the work of the Service must largely depend. At presentmembers of the subordinate branches in the Foreign Office do not belonoto the Foreign Service. Either they form part of the Home Civil service or they are, temporarily recruited at home or abroad. Those who are members of the Home Civil Service are not liable for service abroadalthough they can and do volunteer for it, and those recruited locally on anuiiestablished basis are not pensionable. This system is objectionable from every point of view. To rely to any large extent upon unestablished and non-pensionable elements does not make for efficiency and is unfair io those concerned. It is not intended to exclude the employment of temporaryclerical labour nor that of locally recruited staff when required in postsabroad, but it is most undesirable that confidential papers should be bandiedby those who are nol members of the Service and whose interests are notbound up with it. finally, the fact that essential services in the ForeignOffice are nol part of the foreign Service creates an artificial division between the various branches of the Service, and between home and foreignposts, which restricts free interchange of personnel and hampers efficiency and the development of that esprit de Corps which must exist in any healthyorganisation. It has therefore been decided thai the new Foreign service shall include employees of the subordinate ranks who are established andtherefore pensionable and whose work and qualifications are such as enablethem to he employed both at home and abroad.&apos;.). Tt is necessary to emphasise that, in the Foreign Service, a great measure of direct personal responsibility rests on senior officers, especiallyabroad. Experience has shown that some men, who are entirely satisfactory in the early years of their service, either do not fulfil their promise orlose the qualities of initiative and energy which are necessary if they areto hold positions of greater responsibility. It is therefore essential thatthe Foreign Secretary should be able to terminate, by retirement on pension, the careers of men who, though they may have been excellentsubordinates, are unsuited to fill the highest piosts. This practice has. infact, been usual in the Armed Forces. It will- he necessary to grant tosuch men, who will have given many of the best years of their lives tothe public service, pensions sufficient to keep them from poverty and tomaVk the fact that no disgrace is implied by their retirement.10. &quot;Being liable to&apos;spend a large part of their lives abroad and being subject to. transfer between London and posts abroad, members of the
foreign- Service,, of alL branches, will: be involved in a good deal of expensewhich does: not fall om home civiL servants,, who can. count on spendingtheir careers in this, country and; are- able to-plan their lives, on a. long-term basis. Grants will- accordingly be necessary to compensate officers^ whohave served, abroad,, for any, extra, expense arising, from their transfer tothe United. Kingdom. Officers serving abroad must be ensured emolumentssufficient, to. enable, them, not only to, represent this- country effectively butalso to form a. wide range of contacts. The- effective representation- ofthis, country, abroad&apos; will,, moreover, involve the provision of adequateGovernment buildings for Missions and Consulates,, as. well as adequatestaffs, and. it will, be essential, after the war, to remember that economieson buildings and staffs are false economies if they result in impairedefficiency or. in reduced security for confidential papers. Arrangements willbe made for. the. more efficient administration of the. Service,., for. the inspection of all posts abroad and: for the maintenance of fuller- recordson which to base recommendations to the. Secretary of State forappointments, transfers or retirements on pension.11. These - reforms., will: cost .money. But the: additional, expense will, bea very small price to pay for a thoroughly efficient Foreign; Service such as can contribute appreciably to the avoidance of international conflict. It is-in the hope of creating such a Service that it is proposed to introduce the reforms which are summarised in greater detail Below.SUMMARY OF PROPOSED- REFORMS:L Amalgamation oj the Services ami Begrading^ of Postsi12. After- the last war the Foreign Office- was- amalgamated with the diplomatic Service, but the Commercial Diplomatic and&quot; Consular&quot; Servicesremained separate, and; the Foreign Office was still regarded as part&quot; of theHome Civil&apos; Service: The result was- that&apos; the free interchange- betweenposts of different types, which is essential-&apos; ifall1men- are to get the widertrairung-and-experience-that are - so desirable; and&apos;if the best man is;to bemade available for-any particular-post; was-hindered, and-members-of theCommercial Diplomatic - and Consular- Services were only- in- exceptional cases able toreacli the highest posts: In thej new Service most; officers^ willhave to spend:the greater-part of their careers-abroad, and the Foreign office will in future be regarded1 as;one-of the posts-and:as the headquarters :of theForeign Service, rather than as-a department&apos;of the&apos;-Home&apos; Civil&apos; Service;The amalgamation of the separate Services-into one-complete and: indepen-dent Foreign Service-will, if is-believed; broaden the training&apos; (in its: fullestsense) by combining knowledge of - economic, industrial and&apos;shipping: affairs with practical experience. of?dealing with the public branch the-Press and&quot; withthe wider, appreciation&quot;; of: international- relations- which is- the field ofdiplomacy. The functions-, of; diplomatic officers accredited- to a- foreign government: must continue in:many respects to differ from those of consular officers: The number of consular-posts-must continue- to. exceed - that of diplomatic posts: But.the- maintenance-of the: present disparity:between:thenumbers: of: the: diplomatic and. the consular posts: would-make an..effectiveamalgamation. impossible. It-would mean that if there: were to be-anyequality, of conditions of service all officers: would obtain: a predominantlyconsular experience- and training. This would - be to the: detriment: of. the-political work-ofthe Service; It will,-therefore, be-; necessary to-increase the^numbers.. of diplomatic officers and. to reduce, the number of consular-officers;lit will in any case.be necessary to increase the;size of the diplomatic-staffs-ifMissions abroad are :to be. strong enough to make our influence more widelyfelt, and if officers, being no longer tied to their desks, are to be-enabled to[24543] b 2
ox)ond the range&apos; of their contacts. New arrangements will be made fo 1staffing consular posts of lesser importance, and, by regrouping an(ilreorganising posts and making use of improved communications bv . *, Iadequate and effective consular representation will be ensured.13. By facilitating the transfer fo the Foreign Office of senior officers rflexperience, more effective interchange between posts at home and ahrtndlwill become the rule with the result that members of the Foreign Service!will be able to keep in touch with developments at home and tin; Secret-ir,&apos;!of State will be able to employ the most suitable officer at any particular!post at home or abroad. This will involve the provision of similar salaries!for officers of similar rank whether they are employed at home or in forej &apos;lposts; it will also, involve an increase in the number of posts at home and!the upgrading of posts in the Foreign Office which carry responsibilities!greater than should properly devolve on men of the rank now&apos; attaching toithem. Furthermore, it is desirable to improve the prospects of promotion!in the subordinate ranks of the Foreign Service and to upgrade the status!of certain consular and commercial diplomatic posts of incontestable!importance in order that they may be held by officers of the experience and!standing which the posts merit.II. Recruitment and Training.14. In the conduct of international affairs much depends upon the personal relations which a foreign representative succeeds in establishingwith the Government and people of the country concerned. In the choice ofofficers for the foreign Service particular attention must therefore be paidtu the personality and character of the candidates while ensuring that theypossess the intellectual capacity and the knowledge of foreign countries and foreign languages, of modern history and economics necessary for theircareer. This knowledge can with difficulty be acquired without special studysuch as to-day requires the assistance of private means. This requirementplaces a limitation on the Held of selection of candidates which cannotaccepted. The new scheme of recruitment and training will therefore consistnl a preliminary competitive entrance test designed so that it can betakenwithout special study, followed by a period of training abroad at the expenseof the Stale. At the end of this studentship period candidates will be examined in their special subjects, and. if they qualify, will become members(if the foreign Service. They will then undergo a year&apos;s training in thiscountry, part of which will be spent in the Foreign Oflice&apos;and part in getting a grounding in economic, commercial and social questions. The presentpreliminary Foreign Office Selection Board will be abolished.1&quot;). The entrance examination will thus be taken in two parts. Thefirst will be taken between, the ages of 21 and 23; and the majority of thevacancies will be tilled by means of an open competitive examination(Method 1). While ii is not considered that an entry based upon selectionalone would ensure that candidates possess the necessary intellectual^qualities, it is proposed, as an experimental measure, that candidates for a proportion of the vacancies should be chosen by a method based mainly onselection (Method 2). In order to be able, in exceptional cases, to recruitpersons who by their record since, completing their education have shoothemselves specially suitable lor the Foreign Service, the Secretary of state shall have power, on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commissioners,to accept for the Foreign Service not more than two entrants a year abifjtli.- normal age limit, but not above the age of 30. Such entrants will be chosen by a selection board and will not be required to pass a writtenjexaminat ion.
f Kx For those who compete by Method 1 there will be an opencompetitive examination conducted by the Civil Service Commission ands0 designed that candidates will be able to take it shortly after theirUniversity degree examination and without special study. Althoughdesigned for those who have studied at a University in this country, the examination will be open, as at present, to candidates who have notattended a University. This examination will be similar to that for thekorne and Indian Civil Services in order that candidates may compete forall or any of the Services and that a. larger number of candidates may therefore be encouraged to compete.17. There are men of character and ability who are not good examinees.11K[ whose qualities do not show themselves to advantage in a written examiniation. II is important to widen as far as possible the field of selection and Method &apos;2 has accordingly been designed to secure the services0f suitable candidates who might otherwise prefer to accept some post,outside Government service,, which would depend not upon a written examiniation but upon personality and record. This method is alsodesigned to enable due weight to be given to the claims of character andpersonality as distinct from mere ability to pass written examinations. Foran experimental period-aL-ien years candidates for not: more than 25 percent, of the annual vacancies will be chosen mainly by selection on thebasis of their records, of their showing before an interview board (at whichthey will he required to reach a really high qualifying standard), and of a written examination in the English subjects compulsory for Method 1.Candidates who compete by this method will be required to have reached a certain educational standard. A candidate will be free to compete by either or both of these&apos; Methods in the same year. At the end of the experimental period it will be possible- to determine whether Method &quot;2 hasbeen a success and whether it should be terminated or modified in any way.18. Candidates who compete successfully by either method will begiven travelling studentships from public funds for 18 months in order that,under due supervision, they may study at least two languages abroad,together with history and economics, and acquire the necessary familiarityuitii life in countries other than their own.111. The second part of the examination will be held at the end of thestudentship period when candidates will have to pass a qualifyingexamination in the subjects studied during that period. In each part ofthe examination candidates will have to qualify at an interview before a board constituted by the Civil Service Commission with Foreign Servicerepresentation. The object of these interviews will be to assess the candidate&apos;s personal suitability for the Foreign Service.20. Candidates who qualify will become members of the Foreign Servicesubject to one year&apos;s probationary period of work in this country. Half ofthis period will be spent in the Foreign Office. The other halfwill be spent in the study of economic, industrial and social questions in other Government Departments dealing with these affairs andin visiting centres of industry or in other, suitable ways. The period will include study of labour questions. This training is not aimed at, producingexperts in economic and social questions but at ensuring that all membersof the new Service have a good general understanding of such matters anda foundation on which to build up specialised knowledge if necessary. Atthe end of this period men will be posted to Missions and Consulates abroad.&quot;21. Provision will be made for ensuring an adequate supply of officers forposts in oriental countries.   The importance of a knowledge of oriental as
well as of Latin and Slavonic languages and the need for ensuring that ahjuniors have as wide an experience as possible will be borne in mind in thetraining period and in the posting of officers in the early years of their service22. The provision made for the training of candidates in economic and commercial affairs and the fact that all officers will be liable to serve in commercial diplomatic and consular as well as political posts, should ensurethat&apos; all members of the Service possess at least a general knowledge and understanding of ordinary economics and of commercial practice, tt is felt that, in these circumstances, the appointment to Missions abroad of expert advisers in commercial affairs from outside-the Service may be unnecessary and might, indeed, be undesirable since it would imply thatthese questions were; outside the province of the Foreign Service officerIt is hoped, indeed, that the general level of ability and training ofmembers of the Service will be such that none of them will feel obligedto make any essential part of their work the exclusive province of expertsIt, will, however, be necessary for Heads of Missions to have expertassistance in technical matters, and advisers on economic, labouragricultural and other questions will be attached to them when this is inthe public interest.23. In order further to widen the experience of members of the foreign service and to ensure that they should be kept in close touch with developments in this country, arrangements will be made to attach officers to other Government departments, such as those concerned with commercial and labour questions, for the purpose of training before taking up appoint-rrients abroad or whilst on leave. The seconding or appointment of foreign service officers to posts in other Government departments find vice versawill not be excluded when it-can be shown to be useful to the publicservice, and the appointment to posts in the Foreign Service of men from outside the Government service will be considered in exceptional cases.24. Jn addition, it is intended to continue and develop the arrangementsby which Foreign Service officers may be appointed to United Kingdomposts .in the Dominions, whether in the High Commissioner^ or the TradeCommissionerV offices. It is also intended to promote closer contact between the Foreign Service and the Colonial Service. It is Imped tofacilitate understanding of questions of strategy and Imperial defence by making arrangements for members of the Foreign Service to be attachedto the Imperial Defence College in larger numbers than before the war.III. Conditions of Service at Home.25. Most members of the Service will spend the greater part of theircareers abroad, sometimes in distant and unhealthy posts. Their situationmust, therefore, be considered not as that of men employed in this country,who may occasionally be posted away from home, but rather as that ofmen who spend most of their careers abroad and are only occasionally postedat home. At present, when transferred to London, Foreign service officers are subjected not only to personal inconvenience but also to distinctfinancial disadvantages. Thus, they normally incur considerable indirectexpenditure over their transfer, while the comparatively short period forwhich they may be kept in this country and the uncertainty of their futuremovements makes it necessary for them to plan their lives on a short-term basis. They thus incur greater expenditure over housing, the education ofchildren, &amp;c, than officials who reside permanently in this country and can plan their future with greater certainty. Moreover, Foreign Servii.officers posted to London should not, if they are to do their work properly,be. obliged, through lack of means, to cut themselves off from contact with
yforeign representatives or from those wider contacts which are necessary ifthey are to be effective representatives of this country when they go abroadagain.20 While it is not suggested that the Foreign Service officer at head-niiarters should be required to lead the same representative life as hiscolleague abroad, it would clearly be inequitable if he were to sufferfinancially as a result of the conditions under which he serves. If assistancefrom public funds is to be given to enable persons without private means to compete for the new Service, in order that the basis of recruitment may be widened, it is clearly necessary that such persons should be able to liveon their emoluments when once they are in the Service, whether abroador at home. This they will be unable to do if full account is not taken of their special circumstances.27. It is accordingly proposed that members of the Foreign service should be paid a special grant on transfer to London.IV. A dministration.28. For the administration of the new Service it is proposed to appoint an additional Deputy Under-Secretary of State in the Foreign Office to relieve the Permanent Under-Secretary of administrative and non-politicalwork. Under this officer all questions concerning appointments in theService will be handled by a Personnel Department which will keepsvstematic records of every member of the Service based on reports andon personal contacts. Regular inspection of consular posts is already the rule; it will henceforth be, applied to diplomatic Missions as well. the personnel Department will furnish information for the Promotions board which will advise the Secretary of State on the higher appointments.Because of the amalgamation of the Commercial Diplomatic Service withthe new Foreign Service, the Board of Trade and tire Department of OverseasTrade will be represented on the Promotions Board when the higherappointments to Commercial Diplomatic posts are under consideration. Toadvise the Foreign Secretary in cases of retirement on pension beforethe age of 60, it is proposed to establish a special board under the chair-manship of a former senior member of the ServiceV.  -Superannuation Bill.20. With improved arrangements for the entry and training of candidates for the Foreign Service and the establishment of moresystematic machinery for making appointments, cases of officers being foundunsuitable for service in the highest ranks should, in future, be rare. Itis, however, necessary for the reasons stated in paragraph 9 that theForeign Secretary should, now and in the future, have the power to terminate, by retirement on pension before the normal age of GO, the servicesof officers of the rank of First Secretary, or its equivalent, and upwards, who,though they have committed no fault meriting dismissal, prove unsuited forposts of the highest responsibility and cannot be found other employment inthe Government service. At present the Foreign Secretary has not this power. He is able only to place men on the unemployed list, leavingthem without pay or pension, and is therefore subject to considerable pressure to employ a man even though he feels that he is unsuitable. Itlias accordingly been decided to submit to Parliament a Bill which will give.,ne Foreign Secretary the necessary powers and will provide for suitablecompensation.30. This Bill is aimed at meeting only the immediate needs of theService: &apos; It will be replaced after the war by a comprehensive Foreign
possibleVI. Subordinate Staff.For the reasons given in paragraph 8 it is intended that tin, newForeign Service shall include not only the Diplomatic, CommercialDiplomatic and Consular Services but also the subordinate branches. all members of the new Service will-be pensionable and will be liable, for service abroad as well as at home. Being liable for service abroad the subordinatemembers of the Service will be subject to the same extra expenseresulting from transfer to London as well as from uncertainty of tenureat home, as members of the senior branch. It is therefore intended thai thevshould receive, on transfer to the Foreign Office, grants comparable tothose payable to the latter.32. In addition to the higher posts which will be available in the subordinate branches themselves, it is also proposed that junior subordinateemployees of exceptional merit shall be considered with other candidatescompeting for posts in the senior branch by Method &apos;2 (ace paragraph 17).Provision will further hi1 made lor the promotion of more senior employees,who have proved their suitability, to posts in the senior branch.VI I. Admission of Women.33. Women arc not at present eligible for posts in the administrativebranch of the Foreign Office or in the Diplomatic, Commercial Diplomaticor Consular Services. For the duration of the war, all regular entry into tin:Service is suspended. The Secretary of Stale for Foreign Affairs has.however, already announced his readiness to regard the report of theCommittee, which, in 1934, examined the question of the admission ofwomen into the Foreign Service, as. no longer necessarily being ihe lastword on the subject, and to consider, after the war, the appointment of aCommittee, which will not be confined in its composition to members ofthe Civil Service, to review the question again in the light of tin. existingcircumstances. In the subordinate branches of the Service women willcontinue to be employed as at present.CONCLUSION&apos;.34. The problems dealt with by the Foreign Service are far-reaching.They often involve issues of peace and war and other national interests the greatest importance.
