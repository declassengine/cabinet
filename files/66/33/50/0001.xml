THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.SECRET. / Copy No.    32W.P. (43) 50.February 2. 1943.WAR CABINET.INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON BLACK-OUTRESTRICTIONS.Second Report.AT their meeting on the 11th January, the War Cabinet (W.M. (43).6th Conclusions, Minute 5) invited the Committee to consider what further action could be taken to ensure : (i) an adequate supply of torches (and batteries) for pedestrians;(ii) an adequate supply of head-lamps (and batteries) for pedal cyclists;(iii) an improved performance for the head-lights of motor cars and lorries.We now submit the folloAving report on these points :  Supply of Torches. Cycle Lamps and Batteries.2. Batteries. The Board of Trade and the Ministry of Supply have made an estimate of production and requirements for all purposes over the next18 months. Production for civilian requirements cannot be separately estimated,since the labour, material and plant used in the industry are common to themanufacture of all types of cells. Except where otherwise stated, all the figures in this Report are given in terms of primary cells, since all batteries consist ofassemblies of a number of primary cells of varying sizes.3. Civilian requirements cannot be forecast with precision. On the basis,however, of supplies in 1941, when there was no serious shortage, and allowing for the increased demand for cycle batteries, it is estimated that requirements in 1943 will amount to 60 million cells for cycle head-lamps and 310 million cellsfor torch batteries (including batteries for cycle rear-lamps), and in the first halfof 1944 to 30 million and 155 million cells respectively.The total requirements, including high tension batteries and service requirements, are estimated at 1,998 million cells for 1943 and 1,062 million cellsfor the first six months of 1944.4. The total output of the industry, including Service requirements, was1,600 million cells in 1941 and 1.750 million cells in 1942. The Departmentsconcerned estimated future output at 1,950 million cells for 1943 and 1,050 million for the first six months of 1944. To achieve the total estimated output it willbe necessary :  (a) to maintain the existing labour force in the cell-making and batteriescomponents industries;(b) to provide additional labour as follows :  (i) 300 to provide a second shift at the Siemen&apos;s factory at Norwich,which will increase output by 25 million cells;(ii) such additional numbers as are required to bring the labour force at the Burndept factory at Dundee up to 600 and the labour force at the Ever-Ready factory at Dalkeith up to 700, whichwill increase output at each factory by 75 million cells;(c) to ensure that four extrusion presses are delivered to Messrs. Enfield ZincProducts, Ltd., by March 1943.[249701
The Ministry of Labour expect that the build-up of the labour force to these totalswill be fully completed by the middle of 1943. The supply of the extrusion pressesis in hand, and two will be delivered in about three weeks&apos; time.5. The estimated output, even when thus expanded, will fall short ofestimated requirements by 48 million cells in 1943 and 12 million cells in thefirst six months of 1944. To meet this deficit, we have arranged with the Ministryof Labour and the Ministry of Supply that the labour force will be furtheraugmented by providing a second shift of 300 workers at the Ever-Ready factory at Dalkeith. and an additional 100 workers at the Burndept factory at Dundee.The Departments believe that these additional numbers can be provided andabsorbed into employment by July next.6. In the past, divided responsibility has increased the difficulty of ensuring that production will suffice to meet requirernents. From now on the position willbe much more satisfactory in this respect; for a single Department will beresponsible for planning the output of the industry as a whole. Under arrange-ments which are now being completed, the Ministry of Supply will assume full responsibility for planning the production of all primary cells and batteries,whether required for Service or civilian needs; and an Allocation Committee willbe established, with a Chairman nominated by the Board of Trade, to allocate the output to the best advantage. This Committee will, for example, be able toensure an adequate supply of batteries for cycle headlamps, and will also he ableto spread over all requirements any deficit there may be on total production.7. Many complaints have been made about the shortage of batteries of the&quot; No. 8 &quot; size. These batteries are uneconomical as compared with the largersizes, and although they are still being produced 34 million batteries were produced in the second half of 1942 as compared with 50 million batteries inthe corresponding period of 1941 the Board of Trade have tried to discouragetheir use by prohibiting the manufacture of cases of this size. This change ofpolicy, and other aspects of Government policy in respect of the supply of torchesand batteries, should in our view be explained more clearly to the public. Wehave asked the Board of Trade to arrange for a Press Conference on thesequestions at an early date. As, however, the demand for batteries has now passedits winter peak, the main weight of any publicity campaign would be reserved until next autumn.8. During the first week of January, returns of December output showed that an expected increase in production of batteries for civilian purposes,particularly for cycle lamps, had not materialised, and the Board of Trade took a number of urgent ad hoc measures by assisting firms which had experienceddifficulties in obtaining materials and labour and by diverting output intended for other purposes -to meet the immediate acute shortage. It is estimated thatas a result the production of cycle lamp batteries for January will be aboutIf million, compared with an average monthly output during the previous sixmonths of slightly over 1-i- million. The new arrangements for allocating theindustry&apos;s output referred to in paragraph 6 above should enable all demands for batteries for cycle head-lamps to be met soon after the beginning of February.Up to the present the increase in the supply of batteries for cycle lamps hasto some extent been effected at the cost of torch batteries; but we are assured bythe Departments concerned that the effect of the arrangements outlined above willbe felt in the near future, and that it should shortly be possible to meet all reasonable demands for torch batteries for the remainder of the present winter.The arrangements now set in train should enable all demands to be met in thewinter of 1043-44.9. Torch Cases. The total supply of torch cases in this country in 1941amounted to 22-3 million. This in the main represented capital equipment, andthere is no reason to suppose that supplies on a similar scale will be requiredin future. Complete figures are not available for 1942, but in the first six monthsof that year 5-6 million torch oases were produced (of which 1-2 million were for cycle head lamps). It is estimated that all civil requirements for 1943 willbe met by the production of 8 million torch cases and 3 million cycle head lamps,and for the first six months of 1944 by the production of 4 million torch cases and 1-5 million cycle head lamps. There is no indication of any shortage oftordh cases or cases for cycle head lamps, and we know of no reason for thinking that the estimated production will not meet all requirements, even though largenumbers of persons at present using &quot; No. 8 &quot; torches purchase torches of the
larger sizes. We understand that it should be possible to approximate thesupplies of torch cases of various sizes to the supplies of batteries of correspondingsizes.Head Lights for Motor Cars and Lorries.10. Improvement of driving light. The Lighting (Restrictions) Orderitself does not place any restriction on the area illuminated by a head lamp, except to require that no light shall be thrown on the ground nearer than ten feet fromthe lamp. The British Standards Specification (designed to assist manufacturers to comply with the requirements of the Order) provides for a minimum side-spread,but does not prescribe any maximum; and the side-spread actually providedby the most modern types of head lamp masks is about four times greater thanthe minimum prescribed in the specification.After tests of the Home Office mask, designed by the A.R.P. Departmentbefore the war, the Metropolitan Police reported, in April 1942. that with twohead lamps it was possible to drive safely on dark roads at 30 miles an hour, andthat the lateral spread was very good for cornering, while on dry, light-colouredconcrete roads, with white lines, speeds well above 30 miles an hour were possible.The Hartley and Lucas masks give a rather wider side-spread than the HomeOffice mask.   A mask on the Lucas model is now fitted to all new vehicles.It would be impracticable to secure any general increase of side-spread, either with existing masks or with those now in production, without redesigning themask and arranging for a new issue. Expert opinion is that, even if such a modification were made, the increase would be of little assistance to the driver,and there are security objections to any such modification since an increasedside-spread would throw more light on vertical surfaces at the sides of the roadin urban areas and would tend to make these areas more easily identifiable fromthe air.Our conclusion is that no case has been made out for any modification of theOrder.11. Head-lamp maintenance. We have considered what steps can be takento secure that drivers use the full amount of light permitted by the existing Order.We do not think it would be practicable to make it a legal requirement thatall vehicles should use two masked head-lights or that head-lights should bemaintained at a prescribed standard of efficiency. Many lorries, including all war Office lorries, are fitted with only one head-lamp, and it would be difficult tosupply new head-lamps in large quantities. Further, if the great majority of vehicles had two head-lamps, the remaining minority might be more dangerous to pedestrians who were accustomed to seeing two head-lamps. -We are impressed by the practical difficulties of inspecting head-lamps to ascertain whether they reach a prescribed standard.The effect of more extensive publicity should, however, be tried; and we have approved the general lines of a publicity campaign designed to bring home to owners and drivers the importance of maintaining head-lights in proper condition.This campaign will be carried out by the Ministry of War Transport, inconsultation with the Ministry of Home Security.Lights for Pedal Cyclists.12. We have also considered the possibility of securing&apos; a more satisfactoryriding light for pedal cycles.Experiments show that a lamp with the top half of the glass opaque (as atpresent) but whitened on the inside and with the reflector wbitened or coveredwith white paper gives a riding light which is considerably better than that nowpermitted, and does not produce excessive glare. The Cycling Associations agreethat this is a very considerable improvement and we recommeiid that the Lighting(Restrictions) Order should be amended so as to permit cycle lamps to be screenedaccordingly. This modification has the advantage that it can be carried out quiteeasily by the cyclist himself; and no question arises of manufacturing specialmasks for cycle lamps.Signed on behalf of the Committee :HARCOURT JOHNSTONE.Offices of the War Cabinet,February 2, 1943.
