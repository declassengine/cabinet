THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 8.January 5, 1943.WAR CABINET.COLONIAL POLICY:   REVISED DRAFT OF JOINT DECLARATION.Memorandum by the Deputy- Prime Minister, Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, Lord Privy Seal and Secretary of State for theColonies.AT their meeting on the 9th December the &quot;War Cabinet agreed that thedraft of the proposed Joint Declaration on Colonial Policy should becommunicated to the Dominions. It was also sent to the- Ambassador in washington for his comments.Copies of telegrams from Lord Halifax are given as an Appendix. the replies from the Dominions have been circulated as W.P. (43) 6.In the light of these replies we attach below a revised draft of the joint declaration.If this is approved by the War Cabinet, instructions will be sent at once to*Lord Halifax to sound Mr. Hull on the matter.C. R. A.A. E.C. .0. s.Colonial Office, January 5, 1943.Revised Draft of Joint Declaration on Colonial Policy.1. The immediate aim of the United Nations is to defeat the presentaggression and to render future aggression impossible. This aim requires forits successful achievement the establishment of conditions under which security.,prosperity, ^cqual^tatus and equal opportunityfcan be assured to all peoples.2. This, then, is the eventual aim of those nations which have, owing toApast events, become charged with responsibilities for the future of Colonialpeoples. But it is evident that, while some peoples are far advanced along this,road, the development and resources of others are not yet such as to enable themto achieve security and prosperity by themselves. It is therefore the duty ofParent&quot; States to guide and develop the social, economic and politicalinstitutions of the Colonial peoples until they are able, without danger to./themselves and others, to discharge the responsibilities of government. - j3. Freedom from fear and. want should ,be the assured possession not ofsome but of all peoples. It is the clear responsibility of the &quot;Parent&quot; states to enter into general defence schemes designed to secure the safety of all peoples.The duty of guidance must T5e&quot;discharged in the general interest of all nations as well as in the particular interest of the peoples of the territories concerned.In pursuance of this policy, the natural resources of Colonial territories shouldbe organised and marketed not for the promotion merely of commercial ends, but rather for the service of the people concerned and of the world as a whole.[24864]
4. Although- the &quot; Parent &quot; States will remain responsible for theadministration of their territoriesjlfhe policy embodied in this declaration cannotsuccessfully be pursued without a large measure of co-operation between nations.We accordingly propose the establishment for certain regions, as soon as circumstances permit, of Commissions comprising both the &quot;Parent&quot; states concerned in the region and other States, which have a major strategic or economic interest there. The machinery of each Commission should be designed to givethe people of the territories an opportunity to be associated with its work.These Commissions will provide effective machinery for consultation and collaboration, so that the States concerned may work together to promote the advancement of the Colonial peoples and the general welfare of mankind.APPENDIX.Telegrams from. His Majesty&apos;$ Ambassador at Washington.(1)(No. 6230.   Secret.) Washington, December 24, 1942.YOUR telegram No. 7863 and Sir A. Cadogaids letter of 15th December.1. I am very glad to see how these matters are shaping themselves with you.I send you my comments on the general proposals that you have put to theExecutive Committee, after taking advantage of the opportunity of discussing with Hailey.2. I think that it would be wise if when I approach the Secretary of state should at first confine myself to giving him broad heads of proposed declaration,leaving with him a note of them, and endeavour in conversation to get his further thought, which I hope may run much with ours.3. I am. inclined to agree with the High Commissioners that the fourheadings suggested in your telegram No. 7864 put rather too much emphasis upondefence, and I fear that in their present form they might be criticised by the americans on the ground that the policy which they outline is not sufficientlyspecific as to method and time.4. Question of presentation is of the greatest importance. Tradition leadsthe Americans to attach great value to general statements of rights and principles.Preamble of any declaration in which we ask&quot; them to join will in their eyes be of almost equal importance to the articles which follow. While therefore placingclue stress on defence, it will be advisable to show that in our view securitydepends not only upon provision of means for preventing aggression, but also onattaining improved social and political conditions amongst backward anddependent peoples. The Americans feel that it is the inferiority of theseconditions which has created the cause [group uhdecypherable ? s of] tension and invited intervention and exploitation by more highly organised people. the raising of the standard of life and political status of such peoples thus presentsitself to them as one of the elements of security.5. On further-consideration I think that it is desirable that the declaration should, as Sir A. Cadogan suggests, contain some mention of proposed regional commissions.6. I submit in my immediately following telegram a revised draft ofheadings designed to take the foregoing considerations into account.(2)(No. 6231.  Secret.) Washington, December 24, 1942.MY immediately preceding telegram.1. First aim of the United Nations is to defeat the present aggression and,by rendering future aggression impossible, to establish conditions in which allpeople may look forward to [group undecipherable] attainment of freedom.Once these conditions are assured, it will be possible to proceed with confidence to a more rapid development of political status and social conditions in colonial territories, which is declared to be the primary purpose of the nations chargedwith colonial responsibilities.2. The policy of these parent nations must be guided by the principle ofsecuring that all races should come to enjoy equal status and equal opportunity.
But since it is evident that there are certain people whose development and resources are not such as to enable them to achieve security and prosperity by themselves, it is the clear duty of parent States to further social, economic andpolitical growth of the people who are unable, without clanger to themselves andto others, to assume immediately full responsibility for their own affairs For[group undecypherable: ? new] conditions of life [group undecypherable]conditions of security are the essential foundations of self-government. This dutvof guidance must be discharged in the interest both of the people of those territories and of all nations.3. In pursuance of this policy, natural wealth of colonial territories shouldbe regarded not merely as means for promotion of commercial ends, but ratheras resources which may serve the best interests of the people concerned and ofthe world as a whole.4. To safeguard the execution of this policy there shall be establishedregional machinery for consultation and collaboration both in the interests of theStates charged with colonial responsibilities and those States which may be held[ group omitted : ? to] have a major strategical or economic interest in the regionsconcerned. &amp;(3)(No. 6246.   Secret.) Washington, December 26, 1942.MY telegram No. 6230 and your telegram No. 8158.1.&apos; I took Hailey to see Mr. Hull the day before yesterday and there was some discussion about colonial problems.I was gratified to find how closely Mr. Hull&apos;s mind worked to the lines of developments in my telegrams Nos. 6230, 6231, to which, however, I naturallymade no specific reference, though I told him that you had been giving his suggestion much thought and that I should hope to be able to place him inpossession of your views before very long. Mr. Hull was, as I expected,interested in the raising of social standards as a basis for [group undecypherable]front \sic\ fit for freedom and plainly showed that he was opposed to a systemof international control though favouring international co-operation.2. The President also saw Hailey this morning and raised the question of regional commissions in regard to which he had evidently heard of Hailey&apos;suggestions at the Pacific Relations Conference through the United states representatives.He evidently liked the idea but raised a point about the possible necessity of bringing in the States on South Americans western seaboard in view of their interest in the Pacific islands and future air communications. I think that werode him off this, suggesting that such regional commissions as might becontemplated could well be confined to States having major administrative responsibility in specified [group undecypherable : ? area]s and joint aircommunication interests dealt with by special machinery.3. The President casually observed&apos; that he did not think the phrase&quot; backward peoples &quot; a happy one, nor did he much like the phraseology &quot; parentStates.&quot;   Perhaps you could think of something else.
