THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IN JAMAICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.SINCE 1941, when Lord Moyne submitted to the Cabinet a paper on theConstitution of Jamaica (W.P. (G) (41) 30), this question has been under constantdiscussion, but so far without any result. Indeed, until recently, there had been little agreement in the Island itself.2. Last November, however, I received a memorandum, signed by all the elected Members of the Legislative Council of Jamaica, by three representativesof the People&apos;s National Party and by three representatives of the Federation of citizens&apos; Associations, setting out proposals for certain changes in the Constitu-tion. This represents, on the surface at any rate, an impressive unanimity among all the local elements in the Jamaican political world ranging from the Right tothe extreme Left.3. I set out in the appendix in parallel columns the details of theMemorandum from the signatories in Jamaica and the answers I should proposeto make to each of them. In framing these replies I have had the advantage of prolonged discussion with Sir Arthur Richards, the Governor of Jamaica, whohas just been in this country. There are four main points to which I call mycolleagues&apos; attention.(a) Bicameral System.4. The basis of the proposals contained in the Memorandum is a bicameralsystem. This has been a bone of contention since the days of the Moyne Commis-sion, and my predecessors hitherto have felt that the bicameral system wasinacceptable. I have, however, come to the conclusion that there is no possibilityof making any Constitutional advance in Jamaica unless we are prepared to adopt this system, and this opinion is reinforced by this latest Memorandum, where eventhe extreme Left-Wing party, the People&apos;s National Party, have subscribed tothis doctrine. Our objections hitherto have been based, firstly, on the unhappyexperience of a Constitution of this kind in Jamaica itself during the period 1854to 1865, and, secondly, on the working of similar Constitutions to-day in the bahamas, Bermuda and Barbados. There is, however, this great point of difference : that, whereas these other Constitutions are based on a very restrictedfranchise, the bicameral system in the case of Jamaica will be based upon adultsuffrage. From the point of view of guarding against the risks always involvedin constitutional advances, there is much to be said for the bicameral system, and,in view of the complete unanimity in the Island on this point, I am prepared toagree to it.(b) Executive Committee.It is proposed in the memorandum that this should consist of ten members,of whom seven should be elected by the House of Assembly from among its members and three only should be officials nominated by the Governor. I feel thisis too big an experiment, and am not prepared to go beyond an ExecutiveCommittee of ten members, of whom five shall be elected and five nominated bythe Governor, with the Governor having the casting vote.Printed for the War Cabinet.

(c) Power of certification or of veto.It is proposed in the Memorandum that these should be abolished. I feel itto be essential that both these powers should be retained, although their use mightfoe circumscribed.  I set out in the appendix the methods which T propose.(d) Jamaican Civil Service Commission.Though this is included in the memorandum, it has nothing really to do withthe Constitution, and I should propose to refuse the request, as I am convincedthat under existing conditions such a commission would not prove any adequatesecurity against political interference with the Civil Service.5. The political uncertainties of the last three years have created inJamaica a most unhappy spirit, and I am afraid that, unless in some way we can bring this controversy to an end and establish an atmosphere of co-operation and goodwill, we shall be faced at the end of the war, if not before, with serious trouble. I believe that the proposals which I set out in the appendix should proveworkable in practice, that enough power is retained for effective intervention inthe case of a breakdown, and that there is some chance that they will be acceptedby a great part of the vocal opinion in Jamaica. I accordingly urge my colleagues to endorse these proposals and to authorise me to communicate them to theGovernor for discussion with the Legislative Council in Jamaica.O. S.Colonial Office.February 2. 1943.APPENDIX.Suggestions in Memorandum fromElected Members of LegislativeCouncil and representatives of thePeople&apos;s National Party and Federa-tion of Citizens&apos; Associations.(a) There should be a Legislatureconsisting of a House of Assembly(elected as has already been agreed on abasis of universal adult suffrage) and anominated Legislative Council.(b) The House of Assembly should consist of fourteen members, one to be elected by each of the fourteen parishesfor a term of five years. The Leodsla-tive Council should consist of tenmembers nominated by the Governor.(c) Every candidate for election tothe House of Assembly should deposit 50 and if he receives less than 25 percent, of the votes polled, he shouldforfeit this sum.(d) There should be an ExecutiveCommittee of ten members of whofnseven should be elected by the House of assembly from among its members andthree should be officials nominated bythe Governor.(e) The Executive Committee shouldbe the principal instrument of policyand have the power to initiate all laws,financial and otherwise, and the dutyof preparing the budget.Proposed   manner   of   meeting   these suggestions.(a) I would agree.(b) As adult suffrage is to be intro-cluced, I consider that the House of assembly should have not less than twenty-four members instead of four-teen ; and in order that the oppor-tunities of public service may be spreadas widely as possible throughout thecommunity, I consider that the Legisla-tive Council should consist of fifteenmembers nominated by the Governorinstead of ten.(c) I would agree, but would proposeto suggest that as in this country the deposit should be forfeited if one-eighth instead of one-quarter of thetotal votes were polled.(d) I consider that the ExecutiveCommittee should consist of five elected members, three nominated officials andtwo nominated unofficials. The Execu- &apos; $iitive Committee would absorb all thepresent functions (with the exceptionof the Royal Prerogative) of theJamaica Privy Council which would disappear from the Constitution.(e) I would agree.
Suggestions in Memorandum fromElected Members of LegislativeCouncil and representatives of thePeople&apos;s National Party and Federa-tion of Citizens&apos; Associations.(/) A system should be institutedwhereby members of the House of assembly are appointed as Ministers incharge of departments of administra-tion, such system to begin on a limitedbasis and to provide for progressiveexpansion; and such Ministers shouldbe members of the Executive Com-mittee.these(g) There should be a Speaker of theHouse of Assembly and a President ofthe Legislative Council elected by thosebodies.(A) The power of certification shouldbe removed. The power of veto shouldnot be in the hands of the Governor, butif in his hands ought to be limited and controlled by explicit provisions in theConstitution and by provision for anappeal to the King in Council.(i) The local Civil Service should beappointed and controlled by a localCivil Service Commission until such time as a West Indian Civil Servicemay be established.Proposed   manner   of   meetingsuggestions.(/) I would propose to suggest thatthe House of Assembly should appointfive small committees dealing res-respectively with general purposes;agriculture and lands; education; social welfare; and communications. Thefive representatives of the House of assembly on the Executive committee might be the chairman of these com-mittees. This system, if successful,would provide an embryo ministerialsystem whose limited application wouldawait the stage when the next reviewwould take place.(g) I would agree.(h) With regard to certification i feel that at this stage some reservepower must be provided, but I would agree that this should, be vested in theGovernor in Executive Committee, thatits exercise should be considered onlyon the written request of the Governor,that any decision to exercise it shouldbe reported immediately to the Secre-tary of State, and that except in casesof urgency, it should not be exercisedwithout the Secretary of State&apos;s prior approval.With regard to the power of veto,that is to say, the power to refuse assent to a Bill, this must, I consider, be vested in the Governor. Under every colonialConstitution, without exception, when a Bill is presented to the Governorfor his assent on behalf of HisMajesty, the Governor has discretion to assent, to withold his assent, or to reserve the Bill for His Majesty&apos;pleasure. Any change in this respectwould be without precedent in theColonies. I should see no objection toan understanding that, on the rareoccasions upon which the Governor isnot prepared to assent to a Bill, heshould, in practice, either reserve it forHis Majesty&apos;s pleasure or, beforerefusing assent, consult the ExecutiveCommittee and, if they do not agree,the Secretary of State.(i) I consider that this suggestionshould not be accepted. It is a matterof general agreement amongst all whohave studied the question that the CivilService should be independent of poli-tical control. I am not satisfied that itwill be possible to secure this inde-penclence if the Service were appointed and controlled by a local Civil service commission.
