Arising out of the 86th (42) meeting of the War Cabinet on 6th July, 1942, Iwas asked to consider the question of defining the conditions which must be satisfiedbefore any General Officer in the Field, or Officer acting for him, is justified insurrendering, and emphasizing the obligation on all units to continue fighting so long aspossible. The following paragraphs are the result of careful consideration which hasbeen given to this problem by the Army Council and myself.2. I attach at Appendix A a copy of section 4 of the Army Act, an extract fromthe note to that section in the Manual of Military Law, and paragraph 649 of King&apos;sRegulations. Section 4 of the Army Act constitutes at present the ultimate legal sanction for any regulations which may be issued on this subject. The following questions,therefore, arise:  (a) whether the law itself as laid down in section 4 of the Army Act, is sufficientlystringent and definite;(b) whether the note to that section in the Manual of Military Law correctlyinterprets the law in the light of present day conditions; and(c) whether the regulations based on the law require to be strengthened and made more explicit.3. As to (a) and (6), since the Army Act was first enacted there have been no trialsby courts-martial of senior officers for &quot; shamefully abandoning a garrison &quot; undersection 4 (i) of the Act. During the War of 1914-18, one captain and three other rankswere tried under that section: the officer was found not guilty of an offence under thesection, but was found guilty under section 40 (conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline). The three other ranks were convicted under section 4 (i), but in two cases the convictions were quashed. During the present war, one private soldier hasbeen tried and acquitted under section 4 (i), but was convicted of offences under other sections.4. It is, therefore, not possible to speak from experience with complete certainty of the effect of the law and the interpretation given to it in the Manual of Military Law.The Judge Advocate General states &quot; such a search as I have been able to make clearlyindicates that general^ speaking a commander is justified in abandoning or surrender-ing his post to the enemy only in the last extremity . . . every available means of holding a locality and repulsing the enemy should have been tried and have failed before an abandonment or surrender can be warranted, and if the same be resorted to on anyless pretext the commander will be chargeable with an offence under section 4&quot;. Even,therefore, though the law has not been thoroughly tested for some time and the note inthe Manual may not be very precise, there seems no occasion to amend the law. In anycase to do so would raise political discussion and difficulties which it is desirable to avoidunless the need for amendment is urgent.5. So far as regulations are concerned, it is true that paragraph 649 of King&apos;sRegulations is somewhat indefinite. But I doubt whether much would be gained by its amendment. King&apos;s Regulations are not so familiar to all ranks as no doubt theyshould be, and, in time of crisis, it is not so much regulations as training and moralewhich count. It is, therefore, along the latter lines that I have considered what new-measures are necessary.
6. In any army, especially in any citizen army, the qualities required for doggeddefence and willingness to endure to the last must ultimately be based on nationalcharacteristics and morale. Happily in the British Army we have a sound foundationhere. My colleagues on the Army Council and I, therefore, think that the best approach to the problem of ensuring the ideal of &quot;no surrender &quot; is not by any formal amend-ment of regulations, but by building on the national characteristics, through training and discipline, an instinct, determination and tradition that will make officers and menhold out to the end.7. An instruction on this text was sent out at the end of October in Army TrainingMemorandum No. 44, of which I attach the relevant extract at Appendix 13. A copyof this memorandum was issued to every officer at home, and to the commander ofevery force overseas for the instruction of officers under his command. GeneralMontgomery dealt with the matter on the same lines in some notes for senior officers on the conduct of battle, which he issued early in December, and of which I attach a copy at Appendix C. It seems to me that the Commander of the Eighth Army inthese few paragraphs produced a directive which is clearly on the right lines and whichis bearing fruit in the achievements of his troops in Cyrenaica and Tripolitania.8. To sum up, I do not advise the issue of any amendment to King&apos;s Regulationson the subject of surrender in the field, or any attempt to amend the Army Act, or the note in the Manual of Military Law on the subject. I think that better results can beachieved by revising and amplifying methods of Army training, so as to developdiscipline and morale to the utmost, and by inculcating, as the Army TrainingMemorandum and General Montgomery&apos;s notes do, the highest standards amongstofficers and men. If the War Cabinet agree, I propose to see that even&apos; opportunityis taken by means of training memoranda and by the instruction of officers and soldiersto make the doctrine of &quot; no surrender &quot; widely known and accepted by all ranks.9. It would perhaps not be inappropriate to add a note on the question of the death penalty for desertion in the field and cowardice in the face of the enemy, powersto impose which were deleted by Parliament from the Army Act in 1930. Some have thought that the death penalty should be reintroduced for these offences, and general auchinleck wrote in April last strongly urging this course. I have, however, recentlj-had a letter from General Alexander sajdng that while he considered it was a mistake to have abolished the death sentence for the above offences, he thought there were,many difficulties in the way of its immediate re-introduction. As the position in theWestern Desert when he wrote was that morale was high and the percentage of offences of desertion low, he did not recommend re-introducing the death penalty for this offenceat present. Developments since the Battle of Egypt have certainly not lowered the morale of the Army, and I should not advise that steps should be taken at present tore-introduce the death penalty for desertion.The War Office,18th January, 1943.P.

APPENDIX AThe Army Act Section 4&quot; 4. Every person subject to military law who commits any of the following offences ;that is to say,(1) Shamefully abandons or delivers up any garrison, place, post, or guard, or uses any means to compel or induce any governor, commanding officer, or other personshamefully to abandon or deliver up any garrison, place, post, or guard, which itwas the duty of such governor, officer, or person to defend ; or(2) Shamefully casts away his arms, ammunition, or tools in the presence of theenemy ; or p(3) Treacherously holds correspondence with or gives intelligence to the enemy, ortreacherously or through cowardice sends a flag of truce to the enemy ; or(4) Assists the enemy with arms, ammunition, or supplies, or knowingly harbours orprotects an enemy not being a prisoner ; or(5) Having been made a prisoner of war, volnntarily serves with or voluntarily aids theenemy;shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer death, or such less punishment as isin this Act mentioned.&quot;Manual of Military Law.Note 2 to Section 4 of the Army Act.&quot; 2. Shamefully abandons, etc. This offence can only be committed by the person in chargeof the garrison, post, etc., and not by the subordinate under his command. The surrender ofa place by an officer charged with its defence can only be justified by the utmost necessity,such as want of provisions or water, the absence of hope of relief, and the certainty or extremeprobability that no further efforts could prevent the place with its garrison, their arms and munitions, falling into the hands of the enemy. Unless the necessity is shown, the conclusionmust be that the surrender or abandonment was shameful, and therefore an offence under thissection. The word post includes any point or position (whether fortified or not) which a detachment may be ordered to hold; and the abandonment of a post would also include theabandonment of a siege if there were no circumstances to warrant such a measure.Particulars of a charge under the first part of this paragraph must detail some circum-stances which make the abandonment in a military sense shameful.&quot;King&apos;s Regulations paragraph 649&quot; 649. Any officer or soldier who, when in the presence of the enemy, displays a whiteflag or other symbol in anticipation, or in token, of surrender, will be tried by a G.C.M.*. Incases where the evidence is not sufficient to justify a charge under Sections 4 or 5 of theArmy Act, the charge will be laid under Section 40 of that Act.&quot;* General Court-Martial.APPENDIX extract From Army Training Memorandum No. 44[Issued on 28th October, 1942)24. Defence must be Absolute.In Part I it has been emphasised that defence &quot; to the last man and the last round &quot;requires the highest standard of discipline. This standard is required of the officer as wellas the man. No commander of a locality will order his troops to withdraw unless he receivesan order to do so from his superior. Such expressions as &quot; forced to withdraw &quot; or &quot; driven back &quot; are inconsistent with the defence of a locality. Troops cannot be forced to withdrawor driven back if they intend to stay, as stay they must when so ordered. When everyman has become a casualty, then only is resistance no longer possible. In any other circumstances, &quot; surrender to avoid useless loss of life &quot; is unjustifiable.A commander under orders to hold a locality will move its garrison only if the troopscan be used to better advantage elsewhere to carry out the defensive task allotted. Thus, inorder to counter enemy action, it may be necessary to move forward or to a flank toalternative positions. In any other circumstances such expressions as &quot; shelled out &quot; are inconsistent with determined defence.
The highest standard of battle discipline is required if we are to expect commanders and troops to act in this fashion. This high standard will not be attained unless it is demandedin field training. Troops on exercises must not be allowed to develop the habits of with-drawing without specific orders and. of being taken prisoner; if they are, the habits will persist in battle. It is largely a matter of realistic umpiring. Umpires must never ordertactical withdrawals, and they must avoid assessing that formed bodies of troops have beentaken prisoner. They should assess heavy casualties, even at the risk of operations peteringout, rather than paint dangerously harmful pictures simply to keep an exercise going.There is a further point. A pre-requisite of determined defence by subordinatecommanders and troops is that they should be in no doubt of their superior commander&apos;intention that the defence is to be absolute. It is clear from the accounts of junior officersrecently returned from, theatres of war that, on occasion, they were in doubt about theirsuperiors&apos; intention whether to stand in defence, or to delay. There must be no doubt about that intention in battle, and the habit of avoiding any such doubt must be formed infield training. The responsibility for this decision must not be thrown on to subordinatecommanders.Commanders must avoid the use of such vague phrases as &quot;fight as long as possible but do not incur heavy casualties,&quot; or &quot; delay the enemy but on no account become undulyinvolved&quot;. If a commander does not intend that his troops shall stand &quot; to the last man and the last round,&quot; he must state a time when, or circumstances in which, the position maj&apos;be vacated. Let us remember that a crystal-clear &quot;intention,&quot; confidently expressed,has a great psychological value.&quot;.... ...* * * *APPENDIX CExtract from Notes for Senior Officers on the Conduct of Battle byGeneral Montoothery(Issued December, 1942)* * * *&quot; Morale.3. Morale is the big factor in war. Officers and other ranks have got to bedmbued withthat infectious optimism which comes from physical well-being ; they must be brought tothat stage of mental and physical fitness which will enable them to take on any enemy with complete confidence ; they must be full of offensive eagerness and have the light of battlein their eyes.4. In the end it is the initiative and fighting spirit of the regimental officers, and men inthe ranks, that wins the battle.If this fighting spirit is absent then you fail, however good may be the higher leading.5. The question of &quot; surrender&quot; must be clearly understood.No man who is unwounded, has food to eat and has weapons and ammunition withwhich to continue fighting, must surrender to the enemy.If apparently surrounded and cut off, troops must quickly organize defensive localitiesand continue to hold out; by so doing they continue to embarrass the enemy, and the localities they hold will be of great use in the further development of our own operations.The situation may appear hopeless ; but nothing is ever hopeless so long as troops havestout hearts, a high morale, and have weapons with which to fight.6. A high morale, great determination, and &quot; drive &quot;, are equally important in thehigher ranks. Senior commanders who become depressed when things are not going well,and who lack the drive to get things done and the moral courage and resolution to see their plan through to the end, are useless in battle. They are, in fact, worse than useless theyare a menace since any lack of moral courage, or any sign of wavering or hesitation, has very quick repercussions down below.It is when the issue hangs in the balance that resolution and courage are so necessary; itis easy to be optimistic when things are going well.7. To win battles, therefore, you require an army in which the morale is right on the topline. The troops must have confidence in their commanders and they must have the light of battle in their eyes ; if this is not so you can achieve nothing.&quot;(b42/127)   70   1/43   w.o.p.   12752
