THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1943. &apos;-        most SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 27.January 14, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.PROPOSAL RECEIVED FROM CERTAIN ANTI-FASCIST elements in ITALY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.S.O.E. have for some time been in touch, through an intermediary, with marshal Badoglio and Marshal calviglia in Italy.2. It now appears that Marshal Badoglio is willing at the right moment to take over and establish a military Government. He wishes to send&apos; an emissary,General Pesenti, to Cyrenaioa to discuss with His Majesty&apos;s Governmentco-ordinated action from outside and inside Italy, aimed at the overthrow of the fascist regime.3. Marshal Badoglio is probably the most likely Italian personality to leada successful anti-Fascist movement and to attract the most sympathy and supportinside Italy. Marshal calviglia, who commanded the Italian army at the battle of Vittorio Veneto, is now about 80 years old, but between them they wouldprobably have a powerful and influential following of anti-Fascist elements in italy. General Pesenti does not appear to have played any part in politics, whichrenders his choice for the present purpose suitable. He was General OfficerCommanding in Somaliland from 1939 till January 1941, when he was recalledto Italy for a reason unknown.4. Marshal Badoglio asks for no assurances regarding the future. All thathe asks is (1) that General Pesenti should discuss with us co-ordinated actionto take place at a given moment; and (2) that General Pesenti should be gwenfacilities for recruiting a force from among the Italians resident abroad and prisoners of war.5. The disadvantage in agreeing to Marshal Badoglio&apos;s suggestion wouldbe that if General Pesenti succeeds in forming a force, we shall be committed tosupporting him and the two Marshals. This might be embarrassing ifsubsequently it was felt that some other personality was more likely to succeed in forming an anti-Fascist movement than these two Marshals. We should alsorun the risk of being saddled with a nondescript force of doubtful military value,which might indulge in unwelcome political activities and try to extort undesirablepolitical concessions from us.6. The advantages in agreeing to allow General Pesenti to come out ofItaly would be (a) we should obtain valuable information about conditions andthe situation in Italy and the extent of underground movements; (b) if general Pesenti succeeded in forming an Italian force outside Italy its existencemight have considerable effect on discontented elements in Italy; (c) it would be useful to have a force on the lines of the &quot; Garibaldi &quot; force if and when Alliedoperations take place in Italy, especially as a man of Marshal Badoglio&apos;s standingmight be of value to us when the crack in the Fascist regime approaches.11949   [24919]
7. I should not, however, be in favour of agreeing in advance to marshal Badoglio&apos;s two points, because I think it would be unwise of us to pledgeourselves before we had been able to form an opinion as to General Pesenti&apos;scredentials in the matter of discussing co-ordinated action with him or as to his personal qualifications for rallying Italian prisoners of war and refugees.8. Provided, however, that it is made clear that we cannot discuss anyconditions with Marshal Badoglio&apos;s emissary in Switzerland, and thatGeneral Pesenti must be prepared to come out unconditionally, I consider that advantage should be taken of the approach which has been made to us and thatS.O.E. should proceed with the scheme.9. If General Pesenti does come out, special arrangements will have to bemade as to how and by whom he is to be interviewed, and I would wish to stipulate that at any such interview no offers should be made or undertakings given to himwithout previous reference to the Foreign Office.10. If it is decided to respond to the approach, we should no doubt informthe United States and Soviet Governments.A. E.Foreign Office, January 14, 1943.
