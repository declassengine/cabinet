THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTISSECRET.TO BE  KEPT   UNDER   LOCK   AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this dooument(Translation.)To Admiral Darlan, Algiers.AdmiralAlgiers, November 24, 1942.WE wish to draw your attention to the abnormal constitutional and politicalsituation that has recently been created. Our duty, as the representatives of thepeople, charged with powers and responsibilities clearly defined by theConstitution of 1875, which is still in force, obliges us to express the followingcriticisms &quot;and suggestions :  1. You have proclaimed yourself High&apos; Commissioner for North Africa inthe name of Marshal Petain, Chief of State, who was granted exceptional powers by the Constitutional Law of the 10th July. 1940. Yet, on the one hand, you have not published the text of the document whereby the Chief of State conferredthese functions on you before the invasion of unoccupied France by the german armed forces; and on the other hand you have, in your various messages, veryrightly declared that the Marshal is now a prisoner in the hands- of the germans and is no longer free in his actions or decisions.There can be no doubt that the orders of the Marshal, now that he is in enemy hands, cannot be considered as having a legal and binding character forFrenchmen living outside occupied territory, in particular for residents of north africa.Since the Chief of State has thus been deprived by circumstances of thatliberty and independence which were the essential conditions of the delegation of powers granted by the National Assembly to Marshal Petain personally on the10th July, 1940, this delegation of powers has automatically come to an end, forconstituent powers cannot be delegated to a mandatory who is a prisoner.2. Since the Armistice concluded between France, Germany and Italy hasbeen denounced by Hitler, and Marshal Petain has protested against itsdenunciation and against the occupation by the German and Italian forces offurther French territories, the juridical position of France from the internationalpoint of view has been radically altered. We do not doubt that the Governmentof the Marshal would have appreciated the full implications of the situation ifit had continued to be free in its decisions. But, since the authority of the vichy government can no longer be freely exercised, it is obvious that the authority of another Government must be set in its place in the interests of the French nation and the French Empire.In particular, it is important to resume diplomatic relations as soon as possible with all the States where French interests require representation, and inparticular with those which have already broken off diplomatic relations with the vichy Government. This can only be done by a legal Government that can berecognised by such States.In placing yourself under the authority of the Government of Marshal Petain,who you nevertheless admit is not a free agent, and in limiting your functions to those of a delegate of this Govenrment in North Africa, you do not at presentfulfil any of those conditions which might confer on you the powers of a legal and independent Government.However much we may respect the integrity of Marshal Petain, to whom we are still attached by patriotic gratitude and the hope of seeing both him andFrance set free, we cannot accept even the fiction of any subordination to a captiveGovernment.[24910]
Nor can we consent to see the interests of France neglected or misunderstoodby reason of the lack of a Government qualified to represent them and to insist upon them both during the course of the war and in the preparation of peace.3. Since the Government of Marshal Peta*in has lost its constitutionalauthority, it seems to us that, neither de facto nor de jure, can any legal authoritynow be exercised over those French territories that have escaped enemy occupationunless it derives from the provisions of the Constitution of 1875, which is stillin force. It is therefore in these French territories that a united government must be set up which will fuse all the national forces into single effort for the liberation of all Frenchmen.Only such a Government could succeed in obtaining from the Allied powers in return for the mobilisation of Frenchmen in North Africa and the assistanceof its army, the guarantees essential for the future of our country, guarantees which, as you know, could not at present be granted to a High Commission whoseprovisional character President Roosevelt has made a point of emphasising.Finally, this Government must, from the outset, regroup under a singleauthority all the territories of the Empire, which yesterday were scattered, andwhich recent happy developments in the situation should make it possible toreunite at once in a common desire to restore the French nation.4. In submitting these observations and formulating these suggestions, wespeak on behalf of a public opinion disturbed by the apparent indecision of thepublic authorities and exacerbated by the knowledge that more human lives haverecently been sacrificed to changing conceptions of duty and honour. The peoplefeel instinctively that their destiny is at stake and that the moment in whichthey live is of historic importance. They wish to be guided, led into action, and,if necessary, sacrificed. But they have just received from those who hold andwish to preserve the position of leaders the most confusing instructions and themost disturbing examples.On his return from Vichy, where be had no doubt received personalinstructions from the Marshal. M. Chatel delivered at Constantine a proclamationurging the French and Mussulman population to fight against the Americans andthe British. On his arrival at Algiers he published another which made him the collaborator of those whom he was denouncing as enemies the day before.You yourself organised armed resistance against the Allied troops and nowyou are mobilising soldiers to fight by their side. You mobilised them and sentthem into battle without the certainty that French interests are now under asingle authority, and without a clear picture of the future of France. the statements broadcast by Marshal Petain on the one hand, and President Roosevelton the other, have confused public opinion, and your messages have not succeeded in dispelling the confusion.   It would be cowardice to hide this from you.As long as the Armistice governed the relations between conquered Franceand her conqueror, we were bound by it. We have been set free by our enemiesthemselves from our undertaking to lay down our arms. We take them up again to-day with an added ardour and a fierce determination, because we have learnedby the bitter experience of two years of occupation and so-called collaborationthat a final victory of the Axis would mean our enslavement and moraldegradation.Having resumed the combat, we shall fight to the end with those braveAllies who defend, against the dictatorship of force, the same ideals of peace,liberty and justice for all peoples.Our position appears to us so clear and so just that there can be no hesitation, no uncertainty, no procrastination. It calls for burning enthusiasmand vigorous action, and all our people think again of Clemenceau and hisfamous saying &quot; Je fais la guerre.&quot;You will agree with us. after consideration of your acts and responsibilities,that the destiny of France requires other men, with other methods, at the helm.For ourselves we have but a single aim victory, and a single thought-France.SAURIN,President clu Conseil General cVOran.FROGER,President clu Conseil General d&apos;Alqer.DEYRON,President du Conseil General de Constantine.SERDA,Rapporteur du budget de VAlgerie, Depute.
(Translation.)Letter, addressed to Mr. Roosevelt, President of the United States.Mr. President, Algiers, December 16, 1942.WE had the honour to transmit to you through Mr. Murphy, Civil adviser to the American authorities in North Africa, the text of a letter that we addressedon the 24th November, 1942, to Admiral Darlan.Since we have as yet received no reply from Admiral Darlan and since the abnormal situation created in North Africa continues, it is our duty as repre-sentatives of the sovereign jneople to make a formal restatement of our criticismsand to bring them directly to your knowledge.Admittedly the military operations are the dominant factor in the situation,and we have been too conscious of this to attempt to complicate in any mannerwhatsoever the task which falls to the civil and military authorities in north africa.But in our opinion no consideration can permit a state of affairs contrary tothe constitutional laws of France and to the essential principles of Democracy tocontinue and be maintained under the aegis and with the protection of theAmerican authorities.You will agree with us, Mr. President, that the Allied armies in north africa are not armies of occupation, and that the political status of the French Empire is a matter which concerns the French people alone.It would be a fiction to suppose that the French people have freely chosen oreven willingly accepted the dictatorship which has been installed at Algiersunder the protection of American and British armed forces.By a fantastic paradox the arrival of the armies of the Democracies, whosechief war aim is the re-establishment of liberty, has consolidated the position in north Africa of those very men who, at the instigation of the German authorities,have little by little suppressed every individual liberty and installed a regimebased upon Fascism and Nazism.A state of siege reigns in North Africa. The censorship of the presscontinues. The people cannot make themselves heard, either by the written orthe spoken word, since all the elected assemblies are now suspended. A recentproclamation by Admiral Darlan has even threatened anyone who opposes hisregime with arrest and internment. Meanwhile, within a France which onlyBadio Vichy continues to describe as &quot; free &quot; Hitler has ordered the arrest ofthe highest personages of France without any protest being raised by those authorities here who claim the right to speak in the name of France.How can we hope that French people who are now suffering in body and soulcan achieve freedom through these men, who, under the protection of theAmerican and English armed forces and supported by your silence, have illegallylaid hands on the reins of Government, and who, by a supreme stroke of irony, stillseek to justify themselves by the authority of a Marshal who is in enemy hands and of a Prime Minister who seeks a German victory.How can we hope that the Frenchmen of North Africa, mobilised amidsta confusion of spirit and general contradiction, should throw themselves whole-heartedly into the defence of an ideal which is belied before their faces underthe protection of your authority ? How can we hope that Frenchmen throughoutthe world should believe in the restoration and freedom of our country whenthey see before them the bitter farce of the consolidation in North Africa ofthe most anti-democratic Government that France has ever known, thanks to theassistance of the armies in the American democracy.This situation cannot continue.These men who, for two years, have fanned our hatred, denounced the Anglo-Saxons as our worst enemies, represented the Axis Powers as our best friends,the nen who organised a bloody and senseless resistance to your armies and thenproved unable, after having changed their attitude, to rally the fleet at Toulon,which preferred useless heroism and the supreme sacrifice, these men mustdisappear from the political stage, where they have done nothing but pile upblunders, ruin and disaster.No previous commitment, no patched up arrangement based&apos; on second-rate and non-essential considerations can be permitted to imperil the great drive ofthe peoples of the world to win freedom from all oppression and for all theoppressed.It is not only the interests of France which inspire us, but also the far higherinterests of the democratic ideal for which you have taken up arms and-which
has united the men of all continents for the defence of the individual and for theestablishment of a better justice. It is not ,only, therefore, iii our capacity a selected representatives of Algeria, but also as the only mandataries now qualified to speak in the name of French democracy that we demand that tlhe constitutionallaws of the French Republic should be respected. The Law of the 15th February,1872, grants to the General Council (Conseils Generaux) when Parliament is unable to meet, the powers vested in the two Chambers. We therefore demand theconvocation in free session of the three General Councils of the only three FrenchDepartments that have not been occupied by the enemy. We will lay before them the constitution of a provisional Government which will be invested with thepowers granted to the Executive by the Constitution of 1875. We shall, to thisend, appeal to all persons who can contribute to the well-being of France and the victory of the Allies. Rallying in Algiers all the scattered servants of our country who desire a united and free France, we shall open the way, by the immediatere-establishment of a French Empire closely associated with the common struggle against the forces of the Axis, not only for the liberation of Metropolitan France,but for the victory of a world where liberty and peace will not be vain promises.We are confident that, having reconsidered the-abnormal situation existing in North Africa, you will be able to break the chains which still prevent there-establishment of democratic institutions, for we have confidence in the spiritwhich has inspired your previous messages regarding the future of France, and her re-establishment in all her territorial integrity and in the full exercise ofher liberties.PAUL SAURIN,Depute, President du Conseil General d&apos;Oran.AMEDEE FROGER.President du Conseil General d&apos;Alger.LEON DEYRON,President du Conseil General de Constantine.PAUL CUTTOLI,Senateur de Constantine, Conseiller General.JOSEPH SERDA,Depute, . rapporteur  general  du  budget deV Algerie, Conseiller General.
