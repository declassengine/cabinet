THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET. . Copy No.W.P. (43) 25.January 14, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE COLONIAL SERVICE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE man-power situation in the Colonial Service is causing me muchanxiety. As early as February 1939 the then Secretary of State sent the followinginstruction to all Colonial Governments :  &quot; I feel sure that, in the event of war, Colonial Governments will do all that they can to spare officers in order that they may serve with HisMajesty&apos;s Forces or accept other work directly connected with the national war effort.....Special efforts would also no doubt be made to release anyofficers with military or technical qualifications who would be of particular value to the combatant forces.&quot;2. In the critical days at the beginning of June 1940 a further directivewas addressed to Colonial Governments which contained the following paragraph : &quot; Colonies can help from the military as well as the economic standpointby reducing as far as possible any diversion direct or indirect of man-power from the war effort in this country. As far as Government personnel isconcerned, this end has in many Colonies been served by the release of civilofficers for local military duties which would otherwise have to be performed by officers sent from this country. The resulting deficiencies of staff can insome degree be counteracted, as in this country, by curtailment of leave andlonger hours of work.&quot;3. In response to these instructions, Colonial Governments have releasedconsiderable numbers of their staff for service with the Armed Forces. This isparticularly the case in Africa, where the military authorities have made heavycalls on the civil administrations for European personnel for the local forces and for the Occupied Enemy Territory Administrations. At the present time there are some 250 Administrative Officers and 600 other officers from the TropicalAfrican Dependencies serving with the Forces in Africa or elsewhere; in the caseof Administrative Officers this figure amounts to some 25 per cent, of the totalestablishments.4. The depletion of staffs by such releases and by unavoidable wastage hasbeen relieved to some extent, partly by the loan to other Colonial Governments ofa very limited number of experienced officers who escaped being involved in thefall of Malaya and Hong Kong, partly by ad hoc releases from the Army, andpartly by fresh recruitment from home.5. Notwithstanding the partial relief aiforded by these measures, evidence is accumulating of the excessive strain which is being thrown on the civiladministrations in the Colonies. Curtailment of leave and extension of tourshave had their inevitable effect on the health and vigour of men serving inA^^a- concut]ons- Lord Swinton informs me that, in his view, ColonialAdministrations in West Africa are seriously over-taxed and that the &quot; machinels so stretched that it may break at some important point.&quot; This view is[24918]
confirmed by the observations of my Medical Advisers who have recently visited the African and Middle Eastern territories: The continuance of this situation may gravely prejudice the contribution of the Colonies to the war effort.6. At the same time, the Colonial Service is being faced with many new and urgent tasks. The immediate problems of the war are throwing ever-increasing responsibilities on Colonial Governments. There are also many social and economic questions calling for action, the neglect of which may have serious consequences. In addition, there are likely to be further external demands onthe Colonial Service for the Administrations in Occupied Enemy Territories andfor other purposes : a number of political officers are, for instance, being&apos;earmarked for service in North Africa. Finally, it must be anticipated that asubstantial number of experienced officers, including those at present temporarilyseconded to other Governments from Malaya and Hong Kong, will be requiredin due course for the resumption of administration in the Far Eastern territories.7. There is no reserve of strength from which to meet these present andfuture needs. To attempt to meet them by putting more on tired men undertropical conditions would only defeat its own object. The situation can onlybe met by restoring to civil duties the trained officers of the Colonial service at present lent to the Forces.8. At present this is a matter for negotiation between the Governor ofthe Colony concerned and the local military commander. While the militaryauthorities have been extremely helpful in this matter, I feel now that there isneed for a general and authoritative ruling, especially as the officers in questionmay not be needed for return to their parent Colonies but should be at mvdisposal for posting where their services are most urgently required.9. I accordingly ask for a ruling by the War Cabinet that steps shouldbe initiated at once to place at my disposal for restoration to civil duty ailmembers of the Colonial Service who have been lent for service with the armed forces; it being understood that- (a) a reasonable time shall be allowed for arrangements for replacement tobe made;(b) in the case of officers who have been assigned to service in occupiedenemy territories or to other duties from which they cannot be releasedwithout special difficulty, I shall be ready to give all practicableconsideration to representations from the authorities concerned.0. S...  Colonial Office,January 14, 1943.To be inserted at end of paragraph 8A considerable number of the officers covered by such ruling would be underthe age of 30. Such officers are required for return to civil duties not only to relieve the pressure on the existing staff of civil administrations but also toreceive the further training necessary to enable them in due course to undertake the responsibilities of the higher posts in the Colonial Service. This latterconsideration has a special importance in view of the fact that officers serving in the tropics retire at an earlier average age than members of the Civil service in this country.
