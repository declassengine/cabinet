E.Foreign Office, January 1, 1943.FRENCH MORALE.IN the absence of detailed information regarding the reaction in France tothe occupation of North Africa and the former Free Zone it is impossible to givea clear picture of the present state of French morale.2. Satisfaction and renewed hope are reported to have been widely expressedin Paris on the receipt of the news that the Allies had disembarked in north africa. There is evidence that the reaction elsewhere in the occupied zone wasthe same and that in the unoccupied zone it was only tempered by apprehensionof the German reaction.3. Anti-German feeling, which has grown in recent months as a insult ofthe deportation of labour by more or less forcible means and the brutal methodsemployed against the Jews, will have been stimulated by the following factors :- (1) The scuttling of the fleet at Toulon and the attendant sense of loss. this event should help to restore the self-respect of the former unoccupiedzone.(2) The disbanding of the armed forces.(3) The more stringent measures now reported to be in force for the deportation of workers.(4) The arrest of General Weygand, M. Herriot, M. Jouhaux, Jean Borotraand others.Pro-Allied feeling has no doubt been strengthened by recent indications thatthe Axis are now on the defensive.4. As a result of these factors many Frenchmen who were formerlysupporters of the Vichy regime are likely to have lost their faith in marshal petain as a personal symbol, quite apart from his inability to make any spon-taneous movement. In spite of the fact that Admiral Darlan has never enjoyeda large following in France, he has probably won the allegiance of a part of thefollowers of Marshal Petain on the strength of his assertion that he represents the will of the Marshal and by reason of the fact that he is administering a part11941   [24845]

It is notyet known how this event has been received in France, but the disappearance of this equivocalfigure will remove a good deal of confusion from the minds of our supporters.of the territory of Metropolitan France. The Naval Officers, a majority of who mare his supporters, know well that he is predominantly an intriguer and apolitician, and temper their approval accordingly. The mass of the publicassociate him with active collaboration with the Axis, the delivery of hostagesto the Germans, the imprisonment of large numbers of Frenchmen and the surrender of Indo-China. It appears unlikely, therefore, in spite of the factthat he now has joined the cause favoured by the great majority of Frenchmen,that his regime in North Africa enjoys any considerable support in MetropolitanFrance.5. The first effect of the entry of German troops into the former unoccupiedzone was one of shock, leaving the inhabitants in a state of bewilderment. Forthe bulk of the French public, when they recover themselves, the choice will lie between (a) Gaullism.(b) Communism.(c) Indeterminate support of the Allies, not focussed on any person orparty.(d) Collaboration.(e) Apathy.Such evidence as is available suggests that there has been an increase in support for General de Gaulle. At the same time there is evidence that Gaullists old andnew and Communists as well feel strong resentment against America and, to someextent, against Great Britain for the attitude towards Admiral Darlan. It isalso clear that the emergence of the Darlan regime in North Africa has caused a sharp cleavage among supporters of the Allied Cause in France.*6. So far as concrete results are concerned, it is unlikely that there will beany outbreaks of violence for the time being; apart from the scuttling of thefleet at Toulon and a scuffle at Montpelier the German entry and the demobilisa-tion of the armed forces took place without serious incident, although a numberof staff officers went into hiding and are awaiting a chance of escape from France.When the public have gauged the strength of the German forces in France theremay be a recrudescence of acts of violence of the type hitherto characteristic ofthe occupied zone. But it should be remembered that the cessation of food supplies from North and West Africa, which has already resulted in a reductionof rations, may counteract to some extent the tonic effect of the reintegration ofnational feeling. Wherever Italian troops are present there will no doubt be a succession of minor incidents; there is evidence to show that the entry of italian forces into Vichy territory caused particular resentment.
