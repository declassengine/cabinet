THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 44.January 28, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE UNITED NATIONS PLAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THERE is one important aspect of the question dealt with in the foreign secretary&apos;s Memorandum W.P. (42) 31 to which I should like to draw theattention of my colleagues.The Foreign Secretary has explained that his plan is at present only inoutline, but I think it is necessary at this stage that we should be quite clear in our minds as to the position of the Dominions in relation to the plan.As the Foreign Secretary says in his earlier paper (W.P. (42) 516), &quot; Wehave to maintain our position as an Empire and a Commonwealth. If we fail to do so, we cannot exist as a world Power.&quot; The maintenance of our positionas a Commonwealth depends upon the continued close co-operation of theDominions with this country. This can only be secured if the Dominions aresatisfied that the general order which is to be set up after the war takes sufficientaccount of their interests and responsibilities. We must, therefore, think outclearly what is the place which the Dominions are to occupy in the four-Powerset-up.The Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum speaks of the United Kingdom as amember of the Four-Power Council. On the other hand, the Annex to it refers*sto the &quot; British Commonwealth &quot; as a member of that Council, and also makes provision for the &quot; British Imperial Conference &quot; (which has hitherto been ameeting of Empire Prime Ministers, taking place at infrequent intervalsaveraging four or five years) as a regional organisation under the Four-PowerCouncil, comparable with the Pan-American Union and other regional organisa-tions. Some of these regional organisations also provide for individual Dominionrepresentation. There is, of course, no such organ of government as the &quot; BritishCommonwealth,&quot; and there are formidable objections and difficulties about jointrepresentation on an international body of ail the Empire countries by any oneof them. On the other hand, I feel very grave doubts wdiether the dominions would be willing that the United Kingdom Government should be a member of.the Four-Power Council with no provision for Dominion representation there.They wrould not be satisfied with the argument that their inclusion wrould makethe Council unworkable. In this connection I should like to call attention to theview&apos;s which the Canadian Government have expressed on this very matter. Thisarose incidentally out of discussions on the organisation of post-war reliefadministration, into the details of which it is not necessary to enter here. Theirviews are given in the Annex to this paper, which contains (a) an extract froman Aide-Memoire given by the Canadian Government to our High commissioner at Ottawa, and (b) an extract from a telegram from Mr. Malcolm MacDonaldcontaining his comments. No doubt it will be found that Australia, at any rate,will hold very similar views to Canada as regards the need for full participationby them in the post-war arrangements.In the light of the above, I suggest that it is essential that we shouldformulate clearly our own views upon Dominion participation in the scheme proposed in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper, and that when we have reached our conclusions on the scheme, the next step should&apos; be to consult Dominion Govern-ments upon it before any communication is made to any foreign Government.C. R. A.Dominions Office, January 28, 1943.Copy No.   9V[24966]
ANNEX.(a) Extract from A ide-memorandum re communicated by Canadian Department of external Affairs to United Kingdom High Commissioner, Ottawa, on,January 23, 1943.ON the broader aspects of these discussions we are concerned to note the emphasis placed by the representative of the Soviet Government on the limitationof membership of all International bodies set up to deal with the post-war settle-ment to representatives of the Soviet Union, China, the United States and theUnited Kingdom. While experience between the wars has shown the greatpractical difficulties of applying to membership in International bodies the legalconcept of the equality of States, we are confident that no workable international system can be based on the concentration of influence and authority wholly inbodies composed of a few Great Powers to the exclusion of all the rest. It is not always the largest Powers that have the greatest contribution to make to thework of these bodies, or the greatest stake in their success. In international economic organisations, such as the Relief Administration, representation onsuch bodies can often be determined on a functional basis, and, in our view, this principle should be applied whenever it is feasible. We are glad to note thatthe United Kingdom Government strongly advocate the participation of Govern-ments other than the four main Powers among the United Nations in international organisations dealing with economic problems.We find it essential, however, completely to reserve the position of theCanadian Government as to the conception that ultimate control over, post-warmilitary and political arrangements should be retained exclusively by the fourGreat Powers. This conception is apparently supported by the United KingdomGovernment in the instructions despatched to Lord Halifax on the 16th January.The United Nations cannot in our view, be merely divided into one group ofGreat Powers, exercising responsibility on behalf of them all for the &quot;politicaland military settlement, and another group composed of all the rest, who are excluded from responsibility, no matter how great their contribution may be. norhow profound their interest in the questions to be settled.(b) Extract from telegram from the United, Kingdom High Commissioner,Ottawa.&apos;dated January 23, 1943.THE suggestion from Air. Litvinov that the Policy Committee should be confined to the four big Powers because what we do in regard to the Relief and rehabilitation Organisation will be taken as a pattern for future arrangements in settling other post-war matters. 1 can only repeat what I have urged before,that from my experiences here it is clear thai Canada, for one. will not be ableto co-operate cordially in any post-war system in which authority is concentratedexclusively in the four big Powers. This is not because Canada is narrowlyNationalistic. I think that Canada&apos;s attitude on many issues in the war hasshown that she is far from that. No doubt national prestige enters into the picture to some extent, but the main reasons for Canada&apos;s attitude are severelypractical political considerations. Ministers here are deeply concerned thatpost-war International system should be generally acceptable to Nation, andshould have fair prospect of successful working. I do not need to enlarge ontheir arguments now. You are familiar with them. But I do urge that theirattitude is likely to be adopted elsewhere also, and that any post-war organisation,whether dealing with political or economic questions, is likely to break downunless there is some provision for reasonable if modest representation of thesmaller Powers. I realise all the difficulties involved in this. I venture to saythat these difficulties are less in degree than will be the difficulty of gettingco-operation not only from the Dominions, but also from many other of thesmaller nations in an Internationa] system in which they are excluded from anyshare of real authority.
