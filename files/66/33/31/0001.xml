What, however. I want to be sure about is that even at this early stagethere is substantial agreement among my colleagues as to the main lines of thepolicy which we should from now on pursue. The general approval of the cabinet will be of the greatest assistance both to the Foreign Office and to the political warfare Executive; for, with the continued success of our arms, our Allies, large and small, to say nothing of many persons in this island, cannot be restrained fromshowing increasing interest in Post-War Planning. This paper will enable meto deal with these and, I hope, to make some general political preparation forthe post-war period.A. E.Foreign Office, January 16, 1943.11950   [24923JB
ANNEX.THE aim of British foreign policy must be, first, that we should continueto exercise the functions and to hear the responsibilities of a World Power; and,secondly, that we should seek not only to prevent Europe from being dominated by any one Power, but to preserve the freedom of Europe as essential to our own.2. We cannot realise these objectives through our own unaided efforts. Wecan only hope to play our part either as a European Power or as a World Powerif we ourselves form part of a wider organisation.3. Towards the achievement of these objectives we have already enteredinto certain major commitments, namely, the Atlantic Charter, the Mutual aid agreement with the United States and the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.4. It is impossible to say whether the League of Nations can ever be revivedin its old form, or even whether we would wish to see it revived as it was.Certainly we should make every effort to preserve those technical and. humanitarianservices of the League which have been so conspicuously successful in the past and for which there will be scope in the future. It is perhaps needless to add that the I.L.O. would continue in existence, its functions indeed being extendedif necessary. In the meantime, we have the conception of the United Nations, aconception at once less ambitious and more practical than the conception of theLeague. Upon this idea of the United Nations we must build up the machineryof international co-operation.5. International co-operation between the United Nations will not providethe necessary cohesion and stability unless the Great Powers are prepared toaccept the responsibilities of leadership within the United Nations. For thispurpose the Great Powers must agree between themselves on a common worldpolicy and be prepared, as leaders of the United Nations, to take joint action toenforce it. Failing this, we shall be confronted by the prospect of a world inprecarious balance, with the Great Powers, each with its circle of client States,facing each other in a rivalry which will merge imperceptibly into hostility.6. The leadership of the United Nations will have to come from three, atleast, of the Great Powers the British Commonwealth, the United States, and russia. In view of the attitude of the United States. China, too. must beincluded as one of the Great Powers; though it is to be expected that for a longtime to come she will not be a Great Power in anything but the name. We should,therefore, regard the conception of the Four Powers, working within the frame-work of the United Nations, as the immediate basis of our present, and post-warforeign policy. Later on this conception may be widened to include other states in the category of Great Powers.7. The successful application of the United Nations conception will,however, depend on the validity of two assumptions :  (i) that the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics andthe United States of America will all, after the war, recognise theirworld-wide interests and responsibilities and be willing to enter intoworld-wide commitments in order to guard against &quot;other nationsagain troubling the peace; and(ii) that, politically speaking, the real, if not the declared object of theConcert of the Four Powers will be to restrict the power of Germanyand Japan for as long a period as possible, and will not be based onthe alternative theory that both these Powers should be readmittedto the ranks of Great Powers. (Italy has never been a Great Powerexcept by courtesy, and it would probably not be necessary to treather and the smaller Axis Allies in the same way as Germany and japan.)8. It follows that the most desirable political set-up at the end of the war would be a Council consisting of representatives of the British Commonwealth,the United States, the L.S.S.R., and (pro forma) China, to act, as it were, as a provisional Executive Committee of the United Nations.9. The future of France is obscure, but from our point of view it wouldbe desirable that, provided she recovers her independence and a measure of hergreatness, she should be associated with the other Four Powers in the government
of the world, if only because without the assistance of a rejuvenated France theproblem of preventing a renewed German effort to dominate the Continent willbe much more difficult.10. For a period after the war and until some more comprehensive inter-national system is established, the Four Powers will thus have to undertake themilitary responsibility for maintaining order and preventing the building up ofaggressive forces in Europe and the Far East. This will entail the maintenanceby them of a considerable measure of armaments throughout Europe and in Asia;the complete disarmament of the defeated Powers; and the establishment of an air Force and Naval policing system towards the financing of which the defeatedPowers, relieved of the burden of armaments, should, if practicable, contributeheavily.11. The most suitable agency for these purposes would seem to be an inter-Allied Armistice Commission, which might be charged with the duty ofsupervising a certain number of Reconstruction activities.12. International friction and aggression frequently have their roots in economic and social disharmonies. If standards of living are- too unequal, forinstance, frictions will be created leading to dangerous crises and even to waritself. Consequently it will be of the highest importance for the Four Powersto concern themselves with world economic and social problems, subject, however,to the considerations advanced in paragraph 15 below.13. It will, for instance, be highly desirable, if not essential, to obtaingeneral consent to schemes on the lines of the Clearing Union and the&quot; Commodity Control &quot; schemes, so that an &quot; expansionist spiral &quot; of world tradecan be initiated. Unless such an expansion of world trade takes place theeconomic conditions of many countries, including our own, may become completelyintolerable, and desperate solutions may. be urged by desperate people.14. It will also be desirable to retain some organisation, such as the I.L.O.,to smooth out discrepancies in social standards by the encouragement ofprogressive policies in less advanced countries.15. It is at this point that a reconciliation is possible between the power-doctrines underlying our conception of - the role of the Four Great Powers andthe economic interest of smaller States. If the Four Powers accept the responsi-bilities of effective and overwhelming leadership for reasons of security, theyshould be very careful to allow economic affairs, so long as they do not endangersecurity, to be handled by wider assemblies, whether on a world basis or on regional lines.16. The most important and also the most dangerous area which will haveto be dealt with is Europe. Here, in Europe, is the cradle, and until recently the home, of the civilisation which has now spread to almost every corner of theglobe. Here, too, is to be discovered the source of most of the worst conflicts in modern history.17. The major clanger in Europe is the strong central position of Germany,with her large population and highly developed industries, which are the bases of her military power. The ultimate safety of Europe will depend on the economicas well as the military disarmament of German)-, and an increase in the relativeeconomic status and power of Germany &quot;s neighbours.18. In addition, however, the joint occupation of Germany by the three major Allies should be accompanied by a very close control over its economic life.If this control were successful it would represent an important large-scaleexperiment in European international administration.19. The Armistice and Reconstruction Commission (on which the smallerEuropean Allies should also be represented) would have wide powers, and mightwell co-ordinate certain essential European services, such as transport, outsideas well as inside Germany.20. It is to be hoped that the European neutrals (if any in fact remain atthe end of the war) will agree to work in with this Commission, but it should notbe the intention of the Allies to force them to do so against their will.21. Further, the Allied Forces under the control of the Commission would,in fact, if not in name, constitute an international Police Force, which might at alater stage have a more formal international constitution, and which, might alsobe given a wider field of usefulness in appropriate circumstances.[24923] b 2
22. In some cases, particularly in Eastern Europe, we may hope toamalgamate the smaller Powers into Con federations. Two such Confederationsare already under discussion (one centring round Czechoslovakia and Poland, andthe other round Greece and Yugoslavia) and others might be formed elsewhere.23. Generally speaking, regional groupings should be encouraged, subject always to the principle that there must not be a kind of &quot;limited liability&quot;system. whereby one Power is solely responsible for keeping the peace in any given area. For the conception, if so applied, would give rise to rivalries asbetween one group and another, and; hence sow the seeds of future war. in discussing &quot; regionalism/&apos; therefore, we must assume that all the Four Powers(with the exception of China) are in principle equally interested&apos; in maintaining the peace everywhere in the world, and that they will speak with one voice and act together whenever and wherever it may be threatened.24. Thus the measures taken by the United Nations to pacify Europe andto restore its economic life, will, if they are well conceived and executed, go fartowards creating the conditions under which European unity may eventuallybecome a reality. To provide a unifying political framework for the various,military and economic measures which are envisaged, it is to be hoped that theArmistice and Reconstruction Commission (see paragraph 19) may at some stagebecome a &quot; Council of Europe,&quot;&apos; on which all European States should berepresented, including the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and, if possiblethe United States. But the admission of neutrals and a fortiori of ex-enemiesto full membership of the Council would he a gradual, in some cases a verygradual, process.25. The military security and economic welfare of backward areas with thestatus of colonial dependencies would most appropriately be dealt with l-\Regional Commissions, composed of representatives of parent States and of other nations with a major defence or economic interest in the regions concerned. Suchregions might be. first. South-East Asia; secondly, Africa; and thirdly, the&quot;Western Atlantic. Responsibility for the internal administration of particularterritories would rest with the individual parent State concerned.26. In various other parts of the world the political and economic affairs of particular areas should be dealt with by regional meetings of all the states concerned. Thus, many of the problems of the American Continent would be handled, as at present, by the Pan-American Union. The British Commonwealthalready has its Imperial Conference. The Soviet Union is clearly an entity ona comparable scale. Europe has already been dealt with. A Council of the far east might conceivably be formed with China as a leading figure. In.,the middle east we ourselves might attempt, together with the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates, and in co-operation with Turkey, to set up an organisation dealing withMiddle Eastern question as a whole. &quot; Backward Areas &quot; have been considered in paragraph 25. But all these Regional Councils would ultimately besubordinate, so far as political issues are concerned, to some Council of the Worldwhich, in the early stages after the war at any rate, can for all practical purposesonly consist of the representatives of the Four Powers and possibly also ofFrance, who would represent in their turn all the United Nations. [A diagramis attached.]27. What we want to suggest to the world as a whole, here and now, is thatthere shall, in the World Council, be some ultimate Court of Appeal, but thatin the period after the war it will be necessary for the Great Powers to undertakeobligations on behalf of the World Council until the latter can be fullyorganised.28. In any case, unless something like the United Nations Plan can after this war be established on a firm and durable basis, it is only too likely that thecourse of history will repeat itself and that in the fullness of time Germany willonce again resume the struggle for world hegemony, and that she will employfor the purpose the same subtle and gradual methods as were employed sosuccessfully by Hitler between 1933 and 1939. If, therefore, we believe thatthe United Nations Plan offers the best hope for the future, we should make every possible effort to get it generally agreed without delay.
