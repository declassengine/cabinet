Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (43) 19.January 13, 1943.TO BE  KEPT  UNDER LOCK  AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.THE SPANISH SITUATION.Note by the Secretary of the War Cabinet.THE annexed report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee is circulatedto the War Cabinet and Defence Committee, by direction of the Prime Minister.WE have been instructed^ to prepare a short appreciation of the Spanishsituation.   We report as follows : 2. All recent Intelligence and events have tended to strengthen the view expressed from time to time in our reports to the effect that the Spanish Govern-ment are determined to preserve their neutrality.3. There is evidence that the Spanish Government are satisfied that Alliedoperations in the Mediterranean do not constitute a threat to Spanish territory,and that they recognise that popular feeling in Spain is overwhelmingly againstbeing drawn into the war.4. Spain aims at creating a neutral bloc in the Iberian Peninsula, and has suggested to the Axis that this bloc might ultimately be of value to mediatebetween the Axis and the Allies.5. It is the expressed intention of the Spanish Government to resistaggression from any quarter. Unless the war turned decisively against the Allies,,resistance would be offered to German aggression, since Spain&apos;s apprehension of meeting overwhelming German force has been reduced by the course of the war,and her unwillingness to become a partner of the Axis has been increased.Spanish authorities to-day show anxiety to avoid provocation to the Allies. Thereis evidence suggesting that this anxiety may lead to a curtailment of Axis;activities in Spain.6. Spain&apos;s determination to resist German aggression would includeresistance to any attempt by the Germans to occupy the Balearic Islands orbases there.(Signed)E. E.

7. In assessing future developments of Spanish foreign policy it isimportant not to give undue weight to irresponsible expressions of pro-Axis orInterventionist opinion on the part of individuals whose views run counter to the expressed policy of the Spanish Government. Experience has shown that Francohas throughout effectively controlled the situation, and that he invariably curbsany activities likely to endanger Spaims policy of neutrality. There is no reasonto think that Franco&apos;s power has lessened recently.8. Although Spanish organised resistance would be weak, occupation ofthe Iberian Peninsula, against even guerilla resistance, would be a major military operation requiring, it is estimated some 12-20 divisions, according to the extentof Allied assistance. In view of their commitments, actual and potential, theGermans could not make available the necessary forces for this operation unlessRussian resistance collapsed. The course of the campaign in Russia makes this possibility daily more remote.9. A brief survey of Spain&apos;s policy towards the Axis, showing its logicaldevelopment, is attached.(Signed) V.

VICKERS.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,January 7, 1943.Appendix.SURVEY OF SPAIN&apos;S POLICY TOWARDS THE AXIS.1. General Franco&apos;s Government is totalitarian; it came into power with german and Italian assistance by overthrowing the &quot;Red&quot; Government; itschief fear is that the Reds may rise again and once more plunge Spain into civil war. It was therefore inevitable that Spain&quot;s policy should be closely associatedwith that of the Axis; this was exemplified by Spain&apos;s adherence to the anti-Comintern Pact, by her attitude of &quot;non-belligerence&quot; rather thanneutrality, and more recently by the despatch of Spanish troops to fight on theRussian front. The sympathies of Franco&apos;s Government were on the side of the axis, though Germany&apos;s pact with Russia caused some qualms, and thissympathy naturally increased when Germany went to war against Russia.Nevertheless Franco realised that Spain had not recovered either spiritually ormaterially from the strain of the civil war, and that it would therefore be disastrous for her to become engaged in the present war. From the outset hewas determined not to be dragged into the war if he could avoid it, and hissupport of the Axis was therefore limited to favours such as help for Axissubmarines and aircraft, facilities for Axis intelligence organisations in spain. &amp;c, which, though unneutral, were not likely to involve Spain in war.2. Germany&apos;s early victories confirmed Franco in his opinion that the Axiswas going to win and, consequently, in the wisdom of his policy. This phasecontinued until last year, when the failure of Germany&apos;s campaign in Russiaand the growing strength of the United Nations, and particularly the allied occupation of North Africa, brought home to the Spanish Government that thebest that Germany could hope for was a compromise peace and that her defeatwas possible. Since Spain is now more than ever economically dependent on the goodwill of Great Britain and America for such vital imports as food and oil,this change in Germany&apos;s prospects imposed a corresponding change in Spain&apos;policy; it was no longer safe to associate Spain too closely with the Axis. Thispolicy of disengagement has been followed very cautiously; the most evident signsof it have been the dismissal of the violently pro-Axis Foreign Minister.Serrano Suner. and the recent visit of General Jordana to Lisbon.3. The most important consequence of this change in Spanish policy hasbeen the greatly increased probability of Spanish resistance to any Germanattempt to pass troops through Spain for an attack on Gibraltar.   While, as
fact, i ^appreciating that Germany is not in a position to&apos; back her threats by over-whelming force. It follows that, unless the strategic position changes radicallvto the disadvantage of the Allies, Germany would he unable to secure theunopposed passage of her troops through Spain.4. Meanwhile, there are signs that Spain is beginning to realise that it maybe dangerous to try too high the patience of Great Britain and America on whom she is so largely dependent. There is evidence that Spain may reduce&apos;theunneutral facilities at present afforded to the Axis on Spanish territory.5. Spam is unlikely to come over to the Allies even to the extent of allowing thein the same unneutral facilities as have been permitted to the Axisin the past. The only case in which Spain would actively co-operate with theAll ies would be if Germany invaded Spain in the face of Spanish oppositionIt is, however, in the highest degree unlikely that Spain would agree to stafftalks to meet such a possibility.i
