THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.SECRET. Copy No. 32W.P. (43) 23.January 15, 1943.iTO  BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.REVIEW OF BUILDING PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.Purpose of the Present Review.&apos; 1. In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet (W.M. (42) 170thMeeting, Conclusion 1) I have made a review of all departmental building programmes with a view to adjusting the requirements of the reduced labour force which will be available if 225,000 men ai^e withdrawn from the buildingindustry during the 18 months to the end of 1943. The essential figures areas follows : (a) Labour employed on Government building programme inNovember 1942 (all Departments)............     393,000(b) Labour required in January 1943 on the basis of the pro-grammes stated by Departments before this review      ...     508,000(c) Labour which can be made available for employment on theGovernment building programme on 31st January, 1943 ...     373,000*It will be seen that, on the basis of the programme to which Departments were working, there would have been a deficit in January of 136,000 men. My task,therefore, was to cut down the programmes so as to wipe out this deficit, withsome margin, if possible, for the repair of bomb-damaged houses and for rural housing. I had also to bear in mind that, with the call-up of 15,000 men a month from January onwards, the numbers available for the Government building programme would fall to 358,000* by the end of February, and to 343,000* bythe end of March 1943.2. There are too many uncertain factors to make it possible to frame a detailed programme for the whole year. I have therefore made definite proposalsfor the use of our resources over the next three months only, and suggest thatthe matter should be reviewed again before the end of March. This further review will need to take account of the fact that under the War Cabinet&apos;sman-power decisions, men will continue to be called up from the buildingindustry for the forces or for transfer to the munitions industries during theremainder of 1943. This loss will fall mainly on the labour force available forthe new building programme, and the numbers available under this head will therefore fall by the end of the year to a figure of about 250,000*Proposals for the Next Three Months Service and Supply Departments.3. I have worked out my proposals for the next three months in the formof suggested labour strengths for the various Departmental programmes. these should serve as a measure of the volume of work to be undertaken by each department and of the labour force which it should be possible to make available* These numbers do not represent the whole building labour force in the country, but havebeen calculated by the Ministry of Labour as showing the men likely to be available for theGovernment building programme covered by this review, including that portion of it whichUopai-tinents carry out under the Civil Licensing scheme.[24900] b
for it. It is an essential part of my proposals that the available supply of labour should be treated by the Minister of Labour and National Service as a single pool,which he shall be free to distribute to the best effect in securing the manning upof the programme as a whole within the approved limits. My suggestions forsecuring that Departments actually work to the limits laid down are given inparagraphs 10 and 11 below The&quot;actual figures are summarised in the table in annex I.(a) War Office.The figures which I propose a labour force of 71,000 in January falling to57,000 at the end of March are based on proposals put forward by the Secretaryof State for War, designed to secure living accommodation for 515,000 UnitedStates personnel in the War Office sphere of responsibility by the 1st October, 1943.Some expansion of the labour force would be required during the summer months,if it were later on found, necessary to provide for larger numbers. Further detailsas to the number of United States troops and amount of accommodation are shownin a note given to me by the Secretary of State for War (Annex II).It is for the War Cabinet to decide whether it is reasonable to work to sucha reduced programme for the next three months, but it seems to me a risk thatwe can very properly run. From now on any United States Forces to be aecom-accommodated in this country will be using this island more or less as a &quot; stagingpoint &quot; and can reasonably be asked to use accommodation that would, not be acceptable for a prolonged stay. I am also discussing with the Secretary of Statefor War and the Minister of Health the possibility of affording relief to theprogramme by making greater use for military purposes of the accommodation in the temporary hostels which have been built to provide emergency ac^om-modation in the event of heavy air raids.The proposals of the Secretary of State for War are based on maintaining the storage programme and. on a programme of 70,000 hospital beds out of anoriginal programme of 91,000. The construction of 13 new hospitals will heavoided by the conversion of existing militia camps and I am discussing withthe Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Health the possibility of some further saving by making available for the Americans existing civilian hospital accommodation.(b) A ir Ministry.The Air Ministry programme at present employs a labour force of 120,000out of a total 391,000 men employed on the Government building programme asa whole. At my request, the Secretary of State has given me a note setting outthe types and numbers of squadrons on which the programme of airfield construc-tion has hitherto been based. The programme amounted to 669 airfields, made up of 509 now available, 106 in various stages of construction and 54 not yetstarted. Of these 54, the Secretary of State has already agreed to defer 34, 12 areto proceed because they do not make any call on the general labour pool.* andthe Secretary of State proposes to seek the sanction of the Minister of Defence forthe remaining 8.All airfields now under construction, and any to be started in the near future,should be ready by the spring of 1944 if reasonable progress is made with thework and projects should not be started in excess of our capacity to carry them on at a reasonable pace. Thus the modified proposals of the Secretary of Stateamount in effect to the provision of 635 airfields by the spring of 1944, ascompared with the previous programme of 669. In view of the recent modifica-tion of the 1943 aircraft production programme, a considerably larger reductionin the number of airfields required by that date would appear to be prima faciereasonable.It has not yet been possible to work out revised proposals taking into account the reduction in the aircraft production programme. I recommend, therefore,that the airfield programme for the spring and autumn of 1944 should be further examined in the light of the latest available information as to the probableexpansion of the R.A.F., and as to the arrivals of United States Forces in thiscountry. In the meantime, work should be abandoned, or slowed down, on someairfields with which little progress has been made, in order to enable the best possible progress to be made with the most urgent works, including the 8 newairfields which are being submitted to the Minister of Defence, if it is agreed that* Three to be built in Northern Ireland, two with United States labour and seven advancedlanding grounds to be constructed with R.A.F. labour.
these are required on operational grounds. For the next three months, i recommend a reduction in the Air Ministry labour force from the present level of120,000 to 110,000 at the end of January, falling to 90,000 at the end of March.(cj Admiralty.The First Lord has advanced proposals involving an increase in his Depart-menfs present building labour force of 28,000 to 35,000 in April, fallingfrom August onwards to 27,000 at the end of the year. These figures include an allowance for repairs and maintenance. About three-quarters of the increase isdue to the expansion of the Fleet Air Arm, and the remainder is required for theAdmiralty production or shipbuilding programme or to provide accommodation for the new intake of personnel. I consider that all these needs must be met itis, in particular clear that the airfield programme must match the suppliesof aircraft and carriers ^ which are envisaged. When full information is available as to the Air Ministry programme, I recommend that the Admiraltyairfield programme should be reconsidered in greater detail. But in the meantimeI propose an increase in the Admiralty labour force to meet immediate require-ments from the present figure of 28.500 to 31,000 by the end of March.(d), (e), (f). The figures proposed for the Ministry of Supply, the Ministryof Aircraft Production and the Ministry of War Transport have been agreed with the Ministers concerned.To ensure that there shall be no unnecessary provision of new factorybuildings, &amp;c, by any of the Supply departments, and to enable the best use to be made of capacity rendered surplus by programme reductions, I have already agreed with the Ministers concerned that my Department shall receive earlyinformation of all major demands for works of this character. The Ministerof Aircraft production proposes a reduction in his Departments requirementsafter March at the rate of some 2,250 men per month. The Minister of supply has undertaken to effect such further reductions as may be possible below thefigure of 30,000 during the course of 1943.It will be noted from the table that I am proposing for the Service and supply Departments mentioned above an aggregate labour ceiling for the endof January 1943 of 292,000 compared with requirements for 422.000 on thebasis of previously established programmes, i.e., a saving of 130,000.Proposals for the Next Three Months Civil Departments.4. The civil part of the building programme has already been reduced in themain to strict essentials and I have not, therefore, examined each departmentalprogramme separately. The housing matters to which I have been asked to give special attention are dealt with in the following paragraphs. Leaving this outof account, I am satisfied that some reduction in the labour force employed onthis part of the programme can be secured without interfering with any essential work, mainly by the transfer of labour from shelter work on lines already agreed.This enables me to suggest a labour force for this part of the programme,falling to 70,800 on the 31st March as compared with 85,100 employed last november. Further reductions should be possible later through the decliningdemand for works ancillary to Service projects. The numbers which I p-roposemake allowance for the construction of prisoners of war camps to meet thedemands as at present known.Repair of Bomb-Damaged Houses.5. The War Cabinet were informed in their earlier discussion that therewere 97,000 houses damaged by air attack requiring something more than firstaid repairs. The Minister of Health agrees that we should not consider the repair of 14,000 of these, because they were slums or near slums before beingdamaged, and of 3,000 that are in coastal areas specially liable to attack. Fromsurveys already made in the 24 most important towns it seems likely that ofthe balance of 80,000 about half will consist of houses which would cost morethan  250 to repair. I do not recommend that special efforts should be madeto carry out these more expensive repair jobs, except where the houses in question could be used to accommodate more than one family, as the expenditure of labourand materials would be out of proportion to the advantage gained. I recommend,however, that definite provision should be made to secure the repair beforenext winter of the balance of some 40,000 houses which could be repaired foran average cost of  250 or under (including houses in which the aggregate cost[24900] b 2
is in excess of this sum, but the expenditure per family would be  250 or less).Some of this work can be carried out by local labour that would not in any easebe available for the Government programme; but satisfactory progress will bepossible only if this is supplemented from the general labour pool and I therefore propose to allow 3,000 for this purpose in January, 7,000 in February and 9,000in subsequent months. It is possible that the supply of timber may present difficulties and I am having this question examined.New Housing.6. The Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland have represented to me the urgent need for making some beginning with theconstruction of new houses, but in my opinion it would be premature to take any decision in regard to new housing generally until we know more precisely what the position will be later in the year in regard to the building programme as a whole and the resources available to carry it out.7. I was in particular asked by the War Cabinet to find means, if possible,of carrying out a small programme of new construction of cottages in rural areas.I ask tne War Cabinet to agree in principle that some provision should be madefor meeting this need subject to further investigation of the actual proposals;but I understand that it would, in any case, not be possible to make a beginning with this work before the end of March, and I am therefore making no allowance for this in my proposals for the first three months of 1943. Existing accommoda-tion will be used so far as practicable in order to reduce to a minimum the demandfor new building.8. The Secretary of State for Scotland has represented to me and entirely agree with his view that if there is to be a policy of new house building for England, however limited, a corresponding step should be taken for the benefitof Scotland. I also understand that if a beginning is made in England with asmall rural housing scheme, he would not necessarily consider that rural housingshould have the first claim in Scotland. If, therefore, my suggestion as regardsrural housing is approved, I propose, while discussing detailed plans with theMinisters of Health and Agriculture, to discuss at the same time with theSecretary of State for Scotland the form which a corresponding small housing programme for Scotland might take. I should then be able to submit recommendations for both countries in my next review.Future Control of the Programmes.9. If my proposals are approved it will still be necessary, in order toavoid labour demands in excess of resources, to exercise strict control over theundertaking of new projects in which must be included extensions of approvedcontracts Le., they must be limited to such a calculated amount each month aswill keep the programme balanced. The Departments should not only work to adefinite programme of specific works, but to agreed progress schedules in respectof individual works. Individual projects over a limited size should thereforebe submitted to the Ministry of Works in accordance with established procedure and should be considered by that Department and the Ministry of Labour inrelation to the labour force already employed, progress of existing works, &amp;e,and should not be approved unless it is clear that they can be undertaken withoutunbalancing the programme. Cases of difficulty would have to be referred to me.This should enable me, with the assistance of the Minister of Labour and theMinister of Works, to exercise a continuous control over the building programme and at the same time should give me an opportunity to bring appropriate issuesbefore the War Cabinet or the Minister of Defence without delay.10. These arrangements would provide for the control of new building projects, but the numbers which I have suggested for a number of Departmentsa re not large enough to permit reasonable progress to be made with all the works at present in hand. In these cases the Minister concerned will have to consider,what projects should be abandoned so as to secure a total programme that is within the available resources, informing the Ministers of Labour and Works assoon as possible so that the necessary adjustments can be made.11. The control of building resources is at present exercised under mygeneral supervision by the two Building Directorates consisting of theParliamentary Secretaries of the Service and Supply Departments and Civil
departments respectively. The Minister of Works is Chairman and theparliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Labour is a member of eachDirectorate. If my proposals are approved, I propose to consult my colleaguesfurther as to the inter-departmental organisation that would be appropriate.12. I have considered two possible ways of securing greater economy and efficiency in the execution of contracts and am going into the matter with theMinisters concerned.   The proposals being examined are- (a) All runway construction to be carried out by the Air Ministry;(b) As much departmental building work as possible, other than runways,to be carried out by the Ministry of Works under arrangementssimilar to those recently agreed between the Minister of Works andthe Minister of Aircraft Production.O.
