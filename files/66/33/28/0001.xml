Introduction.1. AT their 70th Meeting on the 13th November, 1942, the lord presidents Committee, when considering our 3rd Report, invited my Committeeto put forward in January a further review of the position covering the calendar year 1943. The present report, prepared in answer to this invitation, falls into two parts, the first dealing with the year as a whole, the second with the moreacute and immediate problems of the first six months.Copy No.    32II. The year 1943 as a whole.Import Requirements.2. In the discussions held in Washington in November 1942, during the visit of the Minister of Production, the figure of 27 million tons was put forward as the total requirement of ocean-borne non-tanker imports to the UnitedKingdom in 1943. This total was sub-divided into departmental programmes asfollows: * Million tons.Food     ...      .............     ...      10-5Materials        ...      ......      ...      ...      14-0Munitions, &amp;c. ...      ...      ...      ....      ...        2-527-03.   We think that the share of the 27 million tons falling to the Ministry of  .Food might more appropriately be placed at 11 million tons than at 10^ million tons.    (A sub-division of the food requirements figure of 11 million tons, bycommodity groups, is given in Appendix A).4. We find it difficult to forecast consumption of imports as far as twelvemonths ahead. Revisions of the production programme now in hand may reducethe net consumption of materials below the planned level. On the other hand,having regard to the disturbance to imports whichy as the &apos;&apos; Torch &apos;&apos; Operationhas shown, must be occasioned by any large-scale seaborne military expedition,and to the sudden and substantial, if temporary, demands which might be made upon United Kingdom food stocks as the direct and indirect consequence ofmilitary operations, it would, we submit, be prudent to aim at attaining a levelof stocks considerably higher than that which the Lord Presidents Committee,[24921] n
last July, regarded as a safe minimum. We therefore see no reason for departing from the figure of 27 million tons as the aggregate requirement for imports intothe United Kingdom in 1943.$Leans of Meeting Import Requirements.5. As a result of the Washington discussions mentioned above, the Presidentpromised the Prime Minister, subject to military emergencies, to furnish enoughadditional assistance to enable us to meet our import requirements, the supplyand maintenance of our armed forces and other services essential to maintaining the war effort of the British Commonwealth (W.P. (42) 563). He also acceptedthe figure of 27 million tons referred to in paragraph 2 above as a substantiallycorrect estimate of United Kingdom import, requirements.6. It was calculated in Washington that in order to ensure an import of27 million tons it would be sufficient to supplement the American tonnage already engaged on our behalf by the equivalent of 300,000 d.w. tons of United Statesshipping a month, cumulative throughout the year. It now appears, however,largely in consequence of a decline in the estimated carrying capacity of Britishcontrolled tonnage, for reasons mentioned, in paragraph 9 below, that even if the300,000 ci.w tons a month were given at a steady cumulative rate throughout theyear our imports would probably not exceed 25-J- million tons in 1943 a shortfallof \\ million tons. (The assumptions underlying this estimate, which, of course,contains a wide margin of uncertainty, are set forth in Appendix B. Inparticular, it is assumed that tonnage engaged on &quot;Torch &quot; and other similarsubsequent operations will amount on average to 1-5 million d.w. tons over theyear as compared with 1-9 million d.w. tons engaged on &quot;Torch &quot; at thebeginning of the year.)7. The timing of United States assistance is almost as important as its &apos;amount. The President, in his letter of the 30th November. 1942. to the PrimeMinister (W.P. (42) 563) said that, because of existing commitments, the alloca-tion of ships during the first three months would of necessity be less than theaverage for the whole period. Any delay, however, in the assignment of Americantonnage to our use will involve a loss of service in the early  months of the vearwhich can only be made good if the average monthly assignment of tonnage overthe year as a whole is raised above the level of 300,000 cl.w. tons. It is important that this should be realised and accepted by the United States authorities. Thereis the further danger that if delays in the provision of American assistance leadto an excessive concentration of imports towards the end of 1943. severe escortdifficulties may arise which will seriously diminish the importing value of thetonnage provided by the United States. This point and its implications are considered more fully in paragraph 14.8. In view of the uncertainties which, as we have seen beset importprospects in the latter part of 1943, we feel it is unnecessary to say more, at this time, regarding the shipping position over the year as a whole, and we thereforeturn to consider the more pressing problems of the first six months.III.-First half of 1943.Imports.9. The shipping position in the first half of 1943 is extremely serious.In our Third Report (W.P. (42) 497 or S.C. (42) 75) we wrote that imports,exclusive of additional American assistance, might fall within the range of9 to 9^ million tons. Since then the prospect has deteriorated, largely becauseof the unexpectedly heavy repercussions, extending into the first months of 1943.of the &quot; Torch &quot; Operation. Ignoring for the moment the drastic cut in indian ocean Area loadings (discussed in paragraph 16 below), we are obliged to reduce our estimate of imports, exclusive of the 300,000 d.w. tons a month of additionalAmerican, assistance, to the vicinity of 8-  million tons.10. No account has been taken in this estimate of any relief from a possibleopening up of the Mediterranean as a regular route for cargo shipping betweenthe United Kingdom and the United States on the one hand, and Indian Oceanareas on the other. Only if the Mediterranean were effectively open before Junecould any benefit accrue to United Kingdom imports in the first half-year.
Import Requirements.11.   The position can be shown in tabular form thus : (million tons)MunitionsFood.  Materials,  and Misc.   Total.Net Consumption        ...       ...      54 6-5 j.q 12-9Stock Changes Contemplated ...    +  -1       --5 -    -4import Requirements   ...      5-5 6-0 10 12-5Probable Imports (excludingadditional American assis-tance and effects of cuts inloadings to Indian Ocean    ...        ... ... ... 8-5Deficit     ...       ...       ...       ... ......     &apos;      4-012. Net consumption of food is estimated above at the original planned level as shown in Appendix A. Net consumption of materials, on the other hand, isnow revised by the Ministry of Production to a figure 1 -2 million tons lower thanthe original planned figure of 7-7 million tons. This drastic reduction followsrecent decisions on man-power, changes in the strategical situation, affecting therequirements for particular munitions items, and policy decisions regardingconsumption, taken in order to conserve raw material stocks, with a view to makingpossible a certain elasticity in the use of shipping later in the year. (An analysisby commodities of the new net consumption figure of 6 - 5 million tons for materialsis given in Appendix C. Consumption of steel, it will be noted, is cut by approximately 8 per cent, from the level originally planned.) The figure for netconsumption of munitions and miscellaneous has been estimated by the depart-ments concerned at 1 million tons for the first half of the year.13. In the above table we assume a rise of 100,000 tons in food stocks anda fall of 500,000 tons in materials stocks over the first half of 1943. This impliesa level of food stocks at mid-1943 some 400,000 tons, and a level of materials stockssome 2-3 million tons above minimum distributional levels as estimated in ourThird Report (W.P. (42) 497 or S.C. (42) 75, Appendix B).14. Apart from the desirability of maintaining an adequate margin of stocks to meet the special demands and disturbances to imports which might arise from active military operations, it is essential to avoid the obligation to importat such a high rate during the second half of the year, both to cover netconsumption and to build up stocks again from crisis levels, as would be beyondthe capacity of the available escorts to handle. If such a situation were to occurit would be at a time when the calls on shipping and escorts for military purposesmay be expected to increase and our inability to meet these calls might wellinfluence the whole course of the war. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the target import for the first half of 1943 should be 12^ million tons.Means of Bridging the Gap.(a) American Assistance.15. The additional American assistance (arising out of the Presidentspromise to the Prime Minister), which will accrue to us in the first half of 1943is uncertain in amount, and likely to be at a lower cumulative rate than in theyear 1943 as a whole. In January it will probably be equivalent to some100,000 d.w. tons and in February about the same, it is not yet known what assistance will be available in subsequent months. The following illustrativemonthly distribution of assistance, on a cumulative basis, is intended to show,not the amount of additional assistance which will actually be forthcoming, butthe amount which would be required to bring in the additional 1-8 million tons,without which, as we say in paragraph 20 below, the import deficit cannot be met.&apos;[24921j B 2
(000 (l.w. tons)January       ......... MFebruary       ...       ......       - - J&quot;JJMarch &apos;       .........      - - ^April............... 600May    ............      - J5^Total of five months   ...The effect of this distribution of assistance on imports in the first half of1943 is not greatly dissimilar to that of 300,000 d.w. tons a month, on a cumu-lative basis. The table gives an impression of how steeply United states assistance must rise in the period from March to May if the short-fall in assist-ance in January and February is to&apos;be compensated by the middle of the year.It should be noted, however, that the distribution of assistance shown above will, only bring in an additional 1-8 million tons of imports within the period ifsufficient cargo is available in North America to enable all the additional tonnage to be employed on the North Atlantic route.(b) Reduction in Shipments to the Indian Ocean Area.16. Reductions have recently been made in shipments of military and civilcargo to the Indian Ocean. If these cuts were continued on the basis of limitingsailings from North America and the United Kingdom to 40 ships a month forthe period up to and including June 1943, the total increment to the UnitedKingdom imports in the first half of the year will amount to some 2 million tons.Of this figure we may expect some 600,000 tons to accrue as a result of thearrangements already made for the month of January.(c) Consumption of Materials.17. Account has already been taken, in the forecast of net consumption givenby the Ministry of Production in paragraph 12, of reductions made fromthe original planned consumption of materials, but special mention might here bemade of fertilisers. It is assumed, in the Ministry of Productions forecast, thatduring the first six months there should be no import or consumption of phosphaterock for the production of fertilisers for the 1943/44 season except in so far asphosphate rock can be brought back from North Africa, without cost to the UnitedKingdom import programme of other materials, in ships which will in any case be in that part of the world for other purposes. It is now forecast that require-ments for the 1942/43 season will be almost met with the aid of such supplies from North Africa in the first three months of 1943. The whole question of the fertiliser programme for 1943/44, and its implications in regard to shipping-will require very serious consideration having regard on the one hand to the strategic position in 1943, and on the other to the food production programme which home agriculture may be called upon to achieve for the harvest of 1944.(d) Economies in Consumption of Food.18. A number of conceivable measures in the sphere of food and agricultural policy, tending to reduce the consumption of imports, are discussed in greater detail in Appendix D. Here they are merely listed with an indication of the approximate net saving in imports within the first six months of 1943, resultingfrom their application as from the 1st March. (Figures for the saving in a fulltwelve months are added in brackets) :(a) Raising the Milling Ratio to 88%    ...       ...       35,000(110,000)(b) Increase in the dilution of bread by a further        90,0005 per cent, (largely at the expense of beer     (260,000)output(c) Bread Rationing ...       ...       ... Unpredictable(d) Reduced Sweets ration ...       ...       ...       ...        20,000(60,000)(e) Reduced Cheese ration ...       ...       ...       ...        15,000(50,000)(/) Emergency slaughter over a year of 10 per cent.       45,000of home-bred beef cattle, 20 per cent, of     (100,000)ewes, all wethers and all lambs not requiredfor replacement purposes, supposing half ofthis slaughter to take place before mid-1943
19. If these economies were applied the combined saving in imports would amount to some 205,000 tons in the 4-month period from March to June, andto some 580,000 tons in a full year, plus whatever saving could be achieved bybread rationing.20. The deficit of imports for the first half of 1943 as calculated in para-graph 11 on a basis which excluded the additional American assistance under the presidential promise, amounted to 4 million tons. If the Indian Ocean sailingsfrom the United Kingdom and North America, were cut to 40 ships a month in thefirst 6 months of the year, as described in paragraph 16, a contribution of2 million tons would be made towards meeting the deficit. If the variouseconomies in the consumption of food considered in paragraph 20 were applied,they would contribute (exclusive of bread rationing) a further -2 million tons!Thus, even if all the economies discussed earlier were applied, there would remain a net deficit of some 18 million tons which could only be filled byadditional American assistance. We have seen, in paragraph 15 above, howsteeply the monthly assignment of American tonnage to our use must rise fromthe levels of January and February in order to enable this gap to be filled.IY. Conclusions and Recommendations.21. The dominating consideration by which we have been guided in pre-paring this Report is the uncertainty of the situation in the second half of 1943,and the necessity of doing all that can be done now to ensure an adequate level of stocks at mid-1943.22. We do not feel competent to make detailed recommendations regardingthe steps which should be taken with regard to consumption economies in food orin materials or with regard to the scale of shipments to Indian Ocean theatres.We would, however, emphasise our view that the relief afforded by any reductionin shipments to Indian Ocean areas or in the consumption of imported materials for the military programme which may be decided upon should.not be regardedas dispensing with the necessity for the utmost economy in civilian consumption.23. We recommend as follows : (a) United States Assistance. Strong representations should be made tothe United States authorities to compensate the serious shortfall inassistance in January or February below the level of 300,000 d.w. tonsa month cumulative by enhanced assistance in the immediatelysucceeding months. The figures quoted in paragraph 15 give a roughindication of the scale and timing of assistance required.(b) Stocks. In order to preserve the maximum strategic freedom of actionin the second half of 1943 food stocks should be raised by at least100,000 tons, and materials stocks should not be allowed to fall bymore than 500,000 tons in the first half of the year, as shown inparagraph 11.(c) Economies in Civilian Consumption. In view of the stringency of theshipping position it is desirable that decisions should be taken at anearly date regarding any further economies in civilian consumptionwhich appear to be possible.(d) 1943 Harvest. In view of the great uncertainties which still prevailregarding importing capacity in the second half of 1943 and the first half of 1944, we would urge that any addition which can be made to domestic food production for the harvest of 1943 should be put in handimmediately.(e) Fertiliser Programme. A decision should be given urgently on the fertiliser programme for 1943/44 and its shipping implications,having regard, on the one hand, to the strategic position in 1943 and,
Offices of the War Cabinet,January 17. 1943.on the other, to the food production programme which home agricul-ture may be called upon to achieve for the harvest of 1944. (Seeparagraph 17 above.)(f) Allocation of imports between the Ministries of Food and Production.-The method of allocation suggested in our Third Report (W.P, (42)497 or S.C. (42) 74, paragraph 23) whereby the Ministry of war transport endeavours to secure a fixed volume of imports to theMinistry of Food over the period, and the remainder accrues to theMinistry of Production, has so far proved satisfactory to all depart-ments concerned, and we recommend that it should continue to beapplied. We regard 5-5 million tons as the appropriate share of theMinistry of Food in a target import programme of 12-5 million tonsbut until the prospect of obtaining imports to this extent in the first half of 1943 becomes clearer, we cannot recommend that a higher figure than 5 million tons should be assured to the Ministry of Food.Signed on behalf of the Committee :HARCOURT JOHNSTON E,Chairman.

The bulk of the additional imports would therefore be usedfor wheat and sugar, mainly the former, and would provide a buffer ,to meet unforeseencalls upon shipping. To provide for unforeseen contingencies, such as military operations,it, would, however, be desirable- to increase stocks of certain canned foods by, say,50,000 tons. Additional imports of some 50,000 tons of commodities other than wheat,sugar and oilseeds would also be desirable to prevent the difficulties which occur withstocks at or near danger levels.(?) Including grain used for flour dilution.

APPENDIX B.Assumptions Underlying Estimates of Non-tanker imports into United Kingdom(a) in 1943 as a whole and (b) in the first half of 1943.A. 1943 as a whole. tiThe estimate of imports of 25-2- million tons in 1943 quoted in paragraph of the Report is subject to the following assumptions :  (a) That the amount of British controlled, non-tanker, ocean going tonnage available at the 30th June, 1943, and also on the average for the year will amount to 17-9 million deadweight tons (13-8 million gross tons).(b) That tonnage awaiting or undergoing repair engaged on United Kingdomwork, or permanently required on routes not serving the UnitedKingdom, together with the tonnage with practically no importingvalue to the United Kingdom allocated to the Fighting Services* will,in the aggregate, and on the average of the year, amount to-4 million deadweight tons (8-1 million gross tons). An analysis of this total will be found in S.C. (43) 3.(c) That   the  tonnage  engaged   on   &quot;Torch&quot;   and - similar  subsequentoperations will amount, on the average of the year, to 1-5 milliondeadweight tons (1-0 million gross tons).(d) That no account is taken of the reduction in shipments from UnitedKingdom and North America to the Indian Ocean Area referred toin paragraph 16 of the Report.(e) That the Sierra Leone convoys will be restarted at mid-February on a20-day cycle, but that otherwise convoys and routeing will remainsubstantially as at present.(/) That the &quot; Torch &quot;tonnage, with some assistance from vessels recentlysecured in French African ports, will import to the United kingdom during 1943 about 1-2 million tons of commercial cargo from Northand North-West Africa.(g) That if we obtain an import (corresponding to our stated requirements)of 27 million tons, it will be possible to obtain 16 million tons of the required imports from the United States and Canada, including the pacific Coast and the Gulf (of which 15 million tons would come fromthe Eastern seaboard of United States and Canada); but that if our imports fall appreciably below 27 million tons the shortage in thecase of the United States and Canada will be proportionately smaller than for other areas.(h) That no account is taken of the possibility that the Mediterranean routemay be reopened to cargo tonnage.(i) That we shall retain the present amount of United States shipping-assistance and that additional United States assistance will beobtained equivalent to an allocation of 300,000 deadweight tons amonth from January on a cumulative basis.2. If the tonnage employed in &quot; Torch and other similar subsequentoperations, instead of averaging 1-5 million deadweight tons over the year (seeAssumption 1 (c), above) were to average 1-9 million deadweight tons (approxi-mately the present level) the import figure of 25-i million tons would have to bereduced to 24  million tons.* Tonnage operating in the interest of the Fighting Services would include the following:  Million(Lie. tons.1.

B.-The First Half of 1943.3. The estimate of imports in the vicinity of 8^ million tons in the first halfof 1943. made in paragraph 9 of the Report, is calculated exclusive of theadditional American assistance assumed; at 1 (i) above. Otherwise it is basedon assumptions which in general correspond to those outlined at (a), (b), (d), (e), (/), (g) and (h) above . As regards &quot;Torch&quot; and subsequentsimilar operations, these are assumed to engage 1-9 million deadweight tons ofshipping over the average of the half-year. This assumption is compatible withan average of either 1 - 5 million deadweight tons or of 1-9 million dead-weight tons over the year, though in the former case it involves a considerablefalling-off in tonnage so engaged in the second half of the year.4. On the supposition, considered in paragraph 16 of the Report, that the reductions recently made in shipments to the Indian Ocean Area were continued on the basis of limiting sailings from North America and the United kingdom to 40 ships a month for the first six months of 1943, imports in the period mightbe raised from about 8-g million tons to about 10^ million tons.** No allowance has been made in, any of the estimates mentioned in this Appendix for losses of United Kingdom imports which may result from recent Indian demands for additional wheatimports.   It is not thought that these losses will be significant in the first half of 1043.

APPENDIX D.Hypothetical Economies in Consumption of Food Imports.1    There are four main directions in which further economies in the.consumption of food imports might be sought :  (a) Increased home production.(/;) Changes in methods of utilisation of cereals.(c) Consumption changes.(d) Emergency slaughter of live-stock.Horne Production.2. Further increases in the acreages of wheat, barley and potatoes are contemplated for the 1943 harvest. Details of the cropping programme are atpresent under consideration by the Agricultural Departments, in consultationwith the Ministry of Food, and it is necessary to await the outcome of these discussions before any estimate can be made of the increase in home-grown foodthat may be expected in 1943-44.Changes in Utilisation of Cereals.3. (a) increased Milling Ratio. The present rate of extraction from wheatis 85 per cent., but owing to the greater amount of moisture in home-grown wheat now a large proportion of the whole the actual yield of flour is less than was anticipated. It has already been agreed that there is no objection on medical grounds to the extraction rate being raised to 87 per cent. With a normal gristsuch an increase would result in a saving of approximately 120.000 tons in a fulltwelve months, but in view of the higher moisture content of home-grown wheatreferred to above, an increase of the rate to 88 per cent, would be. necessary to achieve a similar saving.Any increase in the extraction rate would reduce the quantity of rationedanimal feeding-stuffs available and would result in a loss of live-stock products.Allowing for replacement of live-stock products the nett saving in total importsresulting from increases in the extraction to 88 per cent, would be approximately110.000&apos;tons in a full 12 months, and 35,000 tons during March/June 1943.(b) Dilution. The dilution of flour with oats and barley to the extent of5 per cent, has already been approved, and steps are being taken to introducethis measure as rapidly as possible. In .S.C. (43) 2 an average dilution of5 per cent, has been assumed during the five months February/June 1943 and during the six months July/December 1943. The import economy resulting from increasing dilution a further 5 per cent, would be 260,000 tons over 12 months,and 90,000 tons during March/June 1943. These savings would be slightlyreduced if the milling ratio were raised to 88 per cent.An increased extraction rate and increased dilution would result in a somewhat more compact loaf, which would become stale and crumble more quicklythan the present bread. Although it is not thought that there would be any loss in nutritional value due to dilution, the loaf would be rather less palatable to theaverage consumer.The question whether it is possible to arrange for the production in 1943of increased supplies of bread diluents or to obtain off farms from the 1943harvest a greater proportion of cereals such as barley and oats for dilution isone for consideration by the Agricultural Departments, and the answer must await the results of the discussions between these Departments and the Ministryof Food on the cropping programme referred to in paragraph 2.So far as the first nine months of 1943 are concerned, additional supplies of barley for dilution could only be obtained by curtailing supplies of barley tomaltsters.  This would result in a reduction in beer output.Consumption Changes.4. There is now no margin for further net reduction in the nation&apos;s diet,without adverse effects on national health and the output of workers. Compara-tively small economies might be made in the consumption of certain less essentialfood-stuffs, though it cannot be assumed that these would! result in a net reductionin food consumption, since the national calorie intake would probably be main-tained by slight increases in consumption in other directions.
(a) A reduction of the chocolate and sugar confectionery ration from 3 oz.to 2 oz. per week would result in an import economy of about 60,000 tons perannum, and 20,000 tons during March/June 1943.(b) A reduction from 8 oz. to 6 oz. has already been made in the cheeseration, and a further reduction to 4 oz. is proposed. The gross saving ofimports resulting from this change, even if it were permanently retained, wouldbe only 50,000 tons per annum, or 15,000 tons during March/June 1943. Inpractice, however, it might not result in any nett saving as consumption will almost certainly be diverted to other foods.(c) The possibiiitv of rationing bread was discussed in a paper to the lord presidents Committee by the Ministry of Food in August 1942 (L.P. (42) 174).It was suggested that the saving of imports which might result must remain amatter of speculation. If bread rationing had the effect of reducing total consumption by 5 per cent., without increasing the consumption of other importedfoods, the annual saving in wheat imports would be approximately 280,000 tons.The equivalent figure for March/June 1943 would be 90,000 tons.Emergency Slaughter of Live-stock.5. As mentioned in the Committee&apos;s first Report (W.P.(42) 497 or S.C.(42) 20.paragraph 12 (cl) ), additional supplies of home-produced meat could be provided,and shipping space could be saved, by an emergency slaughter of live-stock. This,however, would involve a reduction in supplies of home-produced meat in subsequent years, and would raise grave issues of agricultural policy that would need the most careful consideration. Much of the meat would be of second qualityor only fit for manufacturing purposes. It was estimated that the emergencyslaughter over a 12-month period of 10 per cent, of home-bred beef cattle inexcess of normal slaughterings, 20 per cent, of ewes, ail the wethers and all thelambs not required for replacement purposes, would provide an addition of up to 100,000 tons of home-produced meat over normal supplies. That estimatestill holds good. If one-half of this emergency slaughter programme were carriedout in the period to the end of June 1943, the additional volume of home-producedmeat would be about 45.000 tons. This, however, would involve the slaughterof a considerable number of ewes in lamb or with young lambs at foot, thussacrificing an appreciable proportion of the year&apos;s lamb crop with a consequentialreduction in supplies of lamb later in the year.Summary.6. The possible economies in food imports which might result from theadoption of these measures may be summarised as follows : (A) (BjImport saving     Import savingover 12 months. during march/June1943.(000 tons.)
