(43) 26-January 15, 1943.WAR CABINET.SKILLED RADIO PERSONNEL.Note by the Minister of Labour and National Service covering progress report by Wireless Personnel Committee.(Circulated for information.)I think that my colleagues will be interested to see the annexed report bythe Wireless Personnel Committee, which has been made to me by Lord Hankey.In submitting this report, Lord Hankey has drawn my attention to the factthat when this work was first undertaken in September 1940 the outlook was extremely critical for all three Services. It is satisfactory to record, as will beseen from the present Report, that the difficulties have now; been surmounted.By September 1942 the previous deficits had been wiped out. Such temporaryshortages as at present exist or are foreseen are due to fresh demands since september last, and the necessary measures are being taken to meet them. Thereis ample elasticity in the present system to meet requirements.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National- Service,-   St. Jameses Square, S.W. 1.THE WIRELESS PERSONNEL COMMITTEE.Progress Report.To the Right Hon. Lord Hankey.1. On the second anniversary of our appointment we present a further progress Report.2. The work of this Committee has continued on the same lines as in theprevious year with the object of finding and training skilled wireless personnel,who are divided, as previously, into two classes : (a) The Officer grade, who are trained in the Universities; and(6) The Radio and Wireless Mechanic grade, who are trained in theTechnical Colleges.Officers.3. It seemed to us, a year ago, when we made our last Progress Report,*that, thanks to the State Bursaries Scheme, the Officer position was reasonablyassured for 1942, and that provided the Bursary Scheme were continued thereshould be no further anxiety on this score.* W.P.

4. It was anticipated some 1,250 potential radio officers would become available from the Universities during 1942, and allocations have, in fact, beenmade as follows : R.N................        10GArmy      ................        389 (inc. 27 A.T.S. and15R.C. Sigs.)R.A.F................        232Government Research Est.     ...      ...        330Industry ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 801,1375. It is gratifying to the Committee to report that the complete require-ments of the Services for Radio Officers in 1942 were thus met in full.6. Difficulty arose in the Industry, however, owing to the increased demandfor radio and communication equipment for the Services which was made known in the Spring and which involved the introduction of &quot; model shop &quot; productionmethods calling for the employment of a higher percentage of skilled technical personnel.7. To meet the load thus placed upon it the Industry required some 240 menof the radio officer class from the Universities instead of 100 as originallyestimated, and some 50 additional experienced technicians.8. Since the output from the Universities was insufficient to meet this need,as well as the Services requirements, the question arose as to the relative priority to be accorded to production as against research work and the effect of a decisionon this point on the distribution of skilled wireless personnel in the government research Establishments and the Industry.9. The problem, we feel, falls into parts, affecting two grades of personnel,namely :  (a) Highly qualified and experienced scientists and radio engineers.(b) Scientific and technical assistants, with good scientific qualifications andtraining, but little experience.10. The shortage of these technicians makes it the more important that thosewhich are available in the Research Establishments and Industry should beemployed in a capacity making proper use of their qualifications. Accordingly,we have made a recommendation to the Production. Planning and PersonnelCommittee of the Radio Board that suitable steps be taken to enquire into thismatter, and we understand that the question is now&apos;being investigated throughthe machinery of the Ministry of Production.Radio Mechanics.11. The scheme for the training of radio mechanics in the Technical Collegesat the beginning of 1941 was sufficiently flexible to meet considerable variations in the numbers of trainees. Originally designed to meet a total Services demand of 5,800 men, the scheme had to be expanded until in February 1942 the loadreached a peak figure of 14,200 trainees in 83 Colleges. Thereafter, with theServices in sight of their 1942 planned establishments for this class of personnel,the input to the Technical Colleges was gradually reduced until, in December,the numbers in training in the Technical Colleges had fallen to 6,420.12. The rate of input has now been once more expanded slightly, and additional training places have to be provided for (a) The increased requirements Of the Services just notified for 1943, andparticularly those of the R.A.F.(6) Further training for some 2,000 Army mechanics, who have alreadypassed through the original ab initio course but whose operationalusefulness will be greatly increased by further training of a practicalcharacter.13. Since its appointment in January 1941 the Committee has trained nearly44,000 men, 18,000 of them in the year just ended.
14. The present estimated position of the Services as regards personnel ofthe Radio Mechanic grade is as follows :  101December 31, 1942. March 31, 1943.	Kequirc-nient.	Strength.	Surplus or Deficit.	liequire-ment.	Strength.	Surplus or Deficit.Navy         ......... Army        ......... Air Force   ......	3,130 13,000 31,743	2,300 13,200 28,397	- 830 4-    200 - 3,346	3,795 ho figures 34,364	3,050 available. 29,530	- 745 - 4,83415. Recent developments, however, make it uncertain whether the R.A.F.requirements will be as large as stated above.16. The Committee does not anticipate any difficulty in affording training facilities to meet the new increase of demand, since the work already done hasinvolved an expansion of the training facilities in the Technical Colleges by 25times above the peace-time level.State Bursary Scheme.17. The State Bursary Scheme is the main medium through which personnel are now supplied from civil life for the provision of Radio Officers.18. We stated in our Progress Report a year ago* that, assuming a continuance of the State Bursary Scheme, some 1.300 men suitable for employment as Radio Officers would come out of the Universities in 1943. Since theCommittee has now decided not to take men from the Universities after their first year, this figure will be reduced to approximately 1,100.19. Radio Bursaries&apos;awarded in 1942 amounted to 750. as against 1,000 in1941; but, nevertheless, a figure which should be adequate to ensure this outputof 1.100 during 1943.Convention of University Radio Teachers.20. Following the introduction of the Bursary Scheme for the provision of radio training in the Universities in the Autumn of 1941, Mr. Rosen, at therequest of the Committee, paid a visit to all the Universities where RadioStudents were being trained, in order that the Committee might have a general idea of the situation in the Universities and any difficulties as to (a) equipment or(b) curricula, which the Committee might help to solve.21. We are deeply indebted to Mr. Rosen for his most valuable work in thisconnection. From his visits it was clear that the main difficulties to be overcomefell under the following general heads : (a) Lack of appreciation of the objective to be secured; and of the amountof radio training necessary when the objective was envisaged.(b) Wide disparity of treatment of the subject at different Universities, bothin theory and in practical work.(c) Lack of suitable equipment, and even lack of knowledge as to the typeof equipment best suited to meet the needs of the radio students.22. Whilst, in general, the equipment needs could be, and have been, metthrough the Committee&apos;s Equipment Section, referred to later in this Report,the Committee came to the conclusion that the best way to meet (a) and (b) above would be by means of a Convention of University Radio Teachers.23. This Convention was held on the 11th, 12th and 13th April, its object being shortly stated as &quot; To consolidate the present Hankey scheme for training radio officersin the Universities by arranging direct collaboration between UniversityRadio Teachers and active representatives of the Services, ExperimentalEstablishments and Radio Industry.&quot;[24914]* W.P, (42) 31.
24. The Convention was enthusiastically welcomed by the Universities, andwas attended &quot;by representatives from all the Universities engaged in the trainingof radio students. Those present gained a first-hand knowledge of the Services&apos;requirements, saw actual equipment in operation at Petersham, and practicalexperiments specially designed, to meet Services&apos; needs at the NorthamptonPolytechnic.25. Most beneficial results have followed. The objective is now fully- realised, a new and more detailed teaching syllabus, with notes on practical work,has been drawn up by a Sub-Committee appointed at the Convention for thepurpose, and the Radio Teachers in the Universities now feel that they are partof a great National effort. Reasonable uniformity of treatment is now assuredat all the Universities, whilst still leaving unimpaired the peculiar individualityof each.26. Arrangements were subsequently made through Captain Sturgeon, ofthe Committee&apos;s Equipment Section, for an &quot; experimental van &quot; to tour the universities in order to show to lecturers and demonstrators in the Universitiesthe experimental equipment displayed to the Radio Teachers who were able toattend the Convention itself.&apos; 27. To keep the University Teachers in line with the march of events, asecond Convention is to be held on the 10th, 11th and 12th April, 1943, and, inorder that they may be fully informed and may have the benefit of our experience in the training of wireless personnel, invitations have been extended to theDominions and the United States to be-represented on this ocasion.Vacation Courses for University Radio Students.28. One of the matters on which great emphasis was placed at the UniversityConvention was the necessity of arranging practical vacation courses on an organised basis for University radio-students. In such courses students would develop the required practical outlook and aptitude much more readily than atthe University, and these courses should be regarded as an integral and essential part of the students&apos; training.29. The Committee accordingly planned to arrange practical courses duringthe summer vacation, 1942, in the Services and the Industry.30. Difficulties arose, however, in securing sanction from the Services forsuitable financial payment to be made to students during such vacation courses and the scheme unfortunately came to nothing in so far as vacation courses in theServices were concerned..31. Arrangements were made, however, through the Radio Manufacturers&apos;Association, for some 210 students to receive vacation training in the works of radio manufacturers.-32. The Committee hopes to be in a position to institute a comprehensive scheme including vacation training in the Services during 1943. If this is to bedone, sanction must be obtained from the Services for suitable payment to be madeto students during their training. Whilst we are hopeful this difficulty may be satisfactorily overcome, the Services final decision is still awaited. The mattermust be cleared very soon now if time is to be available for the operation of an organised scheme of vacation training next summer. -Wireless Personnel from Overseas.33. Last year Canada undertook to provide and train 5,000 R.D.F.Mechanics, including a proportion of Radio Officers. These men received the first part of their training in the Canadian Universities and then either they completed their course at a school set up at Clinton (Canada) or they came over to thiscountry for that purpose.34. The last intake to the Clinton School will fall due in April next, andthe trainees will finish their course there by the end of August.35. Since it is not anticipated any further wireless1 personnel will be avail-able from Canada, it remains to be decided what use is to be made of the school at Clinton when the current courses are ended.&quot;
510236. When, at the beginning of this year, the Services input of radio traineesto the Technical Colleges began to decline, we suggested that the training facilitiesso released, might be offered to the American Authorities to provide wirelesstraining for United States troops in this country.       ,37. We have recently been informed that this suggestion has beensympathetically received, and a statement has been made of the numbers of UnitedStates personnel for whom wireless training is required in this country duringthe next six months.38. The numbers are, so far, quite small, and we have been able to make arrangements to provide the necessary training without any difficulty.Equipment.39. We referred in the Progress Report we submitted a year ago* to theimportance of supplying to the Technical Colleges and the Universities, whereradio courses are in operation, the equipment which is essential for that training,and we stated that, in order to provide that equipment, we had found it necessaryto organise an Equipment Section, working under Captain H. G. Sturgeon, in collaboration with Mr. Browne, one of our Joint Secretaries, and Secretary ofthe Radio Manufacturers&apos; Association.40. During the current year, a financial grant of a further  20,000 wasmade to the Committee by the Treasury for the provision of training equipment making a total of  110,000 in all.41. During the past year, with training in the Technical Colleges decliningrather than, expanding, the supply of equipment for such Colleges apart fromessential maintenance has been on a reduced scale. For. the Universities,however, a considerable amount of equipment has been required in order tomeet their needs respectively for the first and second year training of the RadioBursars.42. The securing and distribution of this equipment has been a complicated and difficult task of very considerable magnitude, which has been carried outmost successfully by Captain Sturgeon and the Equipment Section, with the resultthat all the Universities where radio training is being given were enabled to embark upon their second year with an. adequate supply of the necessary equipment.43. The return of some 2,000 Army radio mechanics to the technical colleges for further specialised training, to which reference was made earlier inthis Report (paragraph 12 (b)), has necessitated also the design and preparationof a particular equipment and its supply to the Technical Colleges, where this further training is being, given, all of which has been successfully done throughthe Equipment Section.Radio Board,44. Since we last reported, His Majesty&apos;s Government have set up a RadioBoard as the co-ordinating body in regard to inter-Service policy, research,development and production. The Board has taken over the whole of thefunctions hitherto performed by other Committees and bodies in this field. ThisCommittee is represented oil the Radio Board and on the Production planning and Personnel Committee of the Board.Conclusion.45. A year ago, while the officer position was reasonably assured, there wasa considerable shortage of radio mechanics in all three Services. We ventured to predict, however, that owing to the measures taken for training in technical colleges,, the existing deficit would be wiped out by September 1942, provided thatno further additions were made to the Service requirements.We are glad to report that the forecast proved correct. Since September,however, fresh demands have been made by the RAT. with which we are nowdealing.* W.P. (42) 31.
46. To-day, looking ahead, now that we have got the training machinery in good running order, both in the Universities and in the Technical Colleges, we expect again to maintain the supply of skilled wireless personnel up to the levelof the demand, provided always that there are no further additions to therequirements of the Services and Industry; and even if some emergency, at presentunforeseen, should arise, our system of training, as has been proved in the past two years, is capable of expansion.CLEMENT JONES, Chairman.January 7, 1943.
