secret.P.U3) 38./2Uh January, 19L3. /VW,iR C;J3BIET&apos;^SHACICLING OF PRISONERS OF WAR.Draft Tele gran to Berne.   . &apos;    - .Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs.-In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet ofIth/Fc-bruc^w a draft reply to the Swiss Government on-the lines agreed on at that meeting was sent to the Canadian Governmentand their views&quot;upon it invited.   No reply has yet been received,,In the meantime I have given further consideration to theterms of the draft and have reached the conclusion that the chances of a favourable response from the German Governmentwould be increased if the policy approved by the cabinet were differently presented.   -I accordingly submit a revised draft for the approval of ray colleagues..,A. E*&apos;FOREIGN OFFICE.  &apos;2Lth January, 1913. . -Copy No.Draft telegram to Mr. Norton.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom acknowledgereceipt of the communication handed by M. Pilet Golaz to HisMajesty&apos;s Minister at Berne on December 17th informing him ofthe views of the German Government in regard to the binding ofprisoners of war.2.   His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to take this opportunityto make plain their policy in this matter.3.   His Majesty&apos;s Government reaffirm their determination to adhere scrupulously to the provisions of the Geneva convention and they have taken, steps, by the issue of orders to allCommanders in the field, to ensure that all ranks shall beacquainted with and observe the terms of. the Convention, withparticular reference to the treatment, of prisoners of warimmediately after capture.   In these orders the general bindingof prisoners of war is.strictly forbidden.. Attention, however,is called to the following consideration.   It is the duty of a prisoner/(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF.HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
prisoner of war during operations to escape or to impede hiscapture if he can do so.   It is equally the duty of every.   -.soldier to prevent any such action by a prisoner of war who maybe in his keeping during operations.     In fulfilment of this duty special measures of restraint, such as the binding ofprisoners,- -may be adopted if the operational conditions make it essential, but the measures must be carried out in a humane manner and as soon as the emergency which necessitated them is overthey must at once be discontinued.4.    In the German communication it is asserted that&quot;His M&apos;ajesty!s Government have attempted to establish a difference between the treatment of prisoners of war on the battlefield and their treatment when they have been brought intoenemy territory and that they maintain that the principles of the geneva-Convention have no application on the battlefield,&quot;    Aswill be clear from the orders, of which a summary-is given in thepreceding paragraph, the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is thatthe express provisions of Article 1 of the Geneva Convention showthat a combatant is deemed to be a prisoner of war and entitledto the protection accorded by the relevant provisions of thatConvention as soon as he has been captured by the enemy.   On thispoint therefore it appears that there is no disagreement betweenthe two Governments.5.   His Majesty&apos;s Government confidently expect that in thelight of these explanations the necessary orders will be issued bythe German High Command for the removal of the counter-measures taken against British prisoners of war.
