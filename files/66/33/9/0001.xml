E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,January 5. 1943.Telegram from the Viceroy to Secretary of State for India,dated January 2, 1943.12.S.C. Personal. Your personal telegrams of&apos; 13th December Nos. 21405and 21406. Colonial policy. I have read them with the greatest interest, and amgrateful for-the opportunity of commenting on them. They are matters on whichI have thought it better not to bring in my Government, and comment which follows represents my personal view. I have seen Dorman Smith&apos;s comments inhis (% telegram) of 17th December No. 944 as affecting Burma, and I am sendinghim copy of my present telegram.2. My own general feeling is as follows : I agree that we must take accountof misunderstandings, jealousies and prejudices on the part of the United Statesof America, and that it would not be wise to leave our colonial record merely(&apos;? to) (? speak) for itself. We must (? therefore) be prepared to cultivate it bothby indirect propaganda and to some extent by endeavouring to establish a common front with the United States of America in regard to it. I would myself see verygreat advantage in indirect propaganda if that could be arranged (value ofspeeches such as Cranborne&apos;s recent speech in the Lords is very great from that point of view), though I think it essential to avoid adopting an apologeticattitude and equally essential to avoid allowing United States of America tocome in on field of which they have no experience (save in the Philippines), forwhich they have no responsibility, and from entry into which they may stand to gain very substantial political and commercial advantages.3. I feel, next, that we must take account of entirely mistaken feelingexisting in United States of America (compare Richard Law&apos;s recent report ofhis visit there) that whether in India, the Colonies, or elsewhere in the Empire,we are merely anxious to hand over, and that we regard ourselves as past our best,and exhausted by our existing responsibilities. Nothing is further from thecase, though where we are dealing with highly developed and wealthy countries with substantial reserves of man-power, and great commercial assets, such as india, which might be capable of standing on their own feet with some assistancefrom us. it has been and still (? omission) our policy to place responsibility on theshoulders of those countries. But Great Britain is going to be pretty tightlysqueezed after the war with loss of export markets, liquidation of foreign invest-ments and the like, and the importance to our trade of colonial empire is clear[24866]
The war breeds strange superstitions, but I am not myself able to share theconfidence of those who appear to think by some act of faith or financiallegerdemain it will prove possible after the war to sustain standards of living inUnited Kingdom from sources other than the annual harvest of our national wealth. My very strong disposition, therefore, would lie to give nothing to any foreign power in colonial or imperial field that we can possibly hold on toI (? consistently), that is, with the maintenance of our general relations with United States of America.4. So far as the Mother Country is concerned, we have got at once to watchher interests in relation even to Dominions. Smuts&apos;s recent speech on colonialquestion, while I have the most profound respect for his character, disinterestedness and record, is consistent with the view that we should shed our interest inour very valuable colony, which we alone have built up. and which we alone (withsome help from the Dominion) are at the moment responsible for defending, tothe nearest Dominion. I am quite conscious that South Africa has always hadambitions to absorb as much of pre-1900 British Empire in that (? continent) as she can. But structure of her polity has above it much that must remain brittleuntil her internal synthesis is completed. Nor will she even be capable, eitherfinancially or in terms of man-power, of carrying defence and other obligations to such areas by herself. Those obligations will fall back on us substantially,and so long as that is so we must remain, in my judgment, senior partner in those areas and watch the interests of the Mother Country as much against theDominions where a clash of interest comes as pre-occupation of Foreign Powers4such as United States.5. I examine next to what extent (? by) compromising with UnitedStates (who are the only people who matter for the present purpose) we shallbuy off ill-feeling, misunderstanding and prejudice in that country. With greatrespect, I do not myself believe, subject to your better judgment, and that ofCabinet, that we shall do anything of the sort. The (? Middle)--West has a highopinion of the capacity of the United States. So have the United States as awhole. The element in that country which has anv real understanding; ofEuropean or major colonial problems is very small : the element which is jealousof, and prejudiced against, Great Britain is very large. It is too easy for agreat industrial country which contains its own granary and meat and milkproducing areas, as well as an extensive range of natural resources, to condemnthe colonial system out of which our Dominions have grown. Good relations withState Department, the White House, or President of the clay (such as the presentPresident), to whom our debt is incalculable, are important. But it is fair topoint out that we are not dealing with a dynasty or with an autocratic ruler.Electoral changes may render completely out of tune a policy which we havemade great sacrifices to support in the hope that it would suit us on a longview. I suggest that we ought to be extremely cautious in tying ourselves upin certain areas of colonial and foreign policy, Nor can I feel confident that united States will not return to isolation at, or shortly after, the end of the war,while I am familiar with, though I do not accept the argument that in certaincircumstances it wouid necessarilv be to our complete disadvantage that theyshould do so.6. (? I agree) that the question of country is relevant to propositionscontained in my preceding paragraphs for to the extent that we might regardourselves as incapable of defending certain areas and might have to call in. in normal conditions, the help of any other great Power, we should to that extentgive that Power a claim, to come in. So far, however, as major operations of a world character are concerned, we shall no doubt always have to consider positionas regards first-class points such as Singapore in terms of support we can secure from our Allies at the time as part of a common defence policy.Other areas may in a major conflict assume abnormal temporary importancesuch as to necessitate general allied control, or substantial allied assistance,for period of emergency. But in &quot;the ordinary course I would have hopedthat Great Britain would be able to man and equip&apos; the Colonies adequatelyfrom her own resources. And I suggest that there is much to be saidagainst giving anything substantial, in terms of a right to foreign countries to butt in, in return for undertakings of interest in our colonial defence whicheither may never have to be implemented, or which course of events would obligeour allies of the time to give us anyhow, whether there are previous understandingsor not.  I think we can claim, too, that conditions in which we are fighting at the
moment are completely abnormal, and that arrangements such as those for Lease-Lend on the one side, assuming a satisfactory decisive victory, and for the making available, with impact involved on our sovereign rights, of naval bases, &amp;c, to theUnited States in the West Indies (? &amp;c.) on the other, are wholly special in character.7. Finally, in the economic and commercial field, the American objective inthe post-war period is likely to be free trade for all. That is a proposition whichcan be argued both ways. But people likely to benefit most by it are the americans. It would be contested with extreme vigour so far as India is con-cerned, and it would not necessarily be at all to our advantage or to the advantageof colonial territories under our control. But it is only to be expected that theurge of big business (and to some extent of State -Department, as representingUnited States feeling) will be strongly in the direction of reducing as far aspossible trade slump, and immense unemployment; that in the United States, asin other countries of the world, will follow conclusion of the war and demobilisa-tion of armies. We have already had ample evidence of American anxiety to digin on air routes, to establish an exclusive claim in such matters as building oftransport aircraft, &amp;c. I do not blame them for that, but we are entitled to take account of it betimes, and look after ourselves.8. On the (? specific)&apos;proposals put to the Dominion Prime Ministers, ingeneral I would comment that, while accepting advantage of trying to remove the misunderstandings, &amp;c, I see in certain circumstances some danger in generaldeclarations of this type. The Atlantic Charter, great as its advantages and importance have been, has in it the seeds of severe controversy in the Indian field.Any general declaration that we may make in the colonial field ought, I would urge, be most cai*efully worded. Once it is on paper, we are tied to it. And,while we may have agreed to it with our friends, our friends may not be in office in another couple of years, and we must in its woixling protect ourselves and oursuccessors against any construction in excess of the maximum we ourselves hadin mind in concluding the Declaration.9. I would comment, secondly, that Peace Treaty ought not to be a post-mortem on British Empire attended by relatives and debtors. We have bornea major burden of this war, and we must be prepared, as I see it, to fight ourcorner at Peace Treaty and elsewhere (? and still) surrender nothing that we canpossibly hold on to. That is a further argument for care in the&quot; working&quot; [BcJ ofany^DtBcTaration such as the present.10. Subject to the above, I agree that there would be some advantage in ajoint declaration. Strictly, and (? it may be) it is vital, that it should be specifically -cally laid down that each (? parent) State should have the unquestioned right to administer its own territories without interference from other partners in thegeneral Colonial Board. I also agree that it is of extreme importance that india should be excluded from, the purview of these proposals ( \ (our own) interestsapart extreme offence would be given in this country by any suggestion of inter-ference either by Americans or Chinese in its internal affairs). Nor could we accept, given the (omission) divisions in this country and substantial delay whichmay yet elapse before full self-government or Dominion status can be attainedthat she should be recognised as entitled to speak as a parent State (I am uneasyon that point at statement by Hull quoted in your 21406 that general statement would make it plain that attainment of freedom involved not only mutual respon-sibility of &quot; Parent States &quot; but &apos;&apos; of those who aspired to it,&quot; and I think pointought to be most carefully watched).11. As regards misconceptions about British Colonial policy, I would strongly advocate that we should try to deal with these by indirect rather than by direct methods. Latter have far too much appearance of acceptance on our partof validity of criticisms levelled against us, a (? validity) which I do not myselfaccept.12. I am shy about welcoming sans phrase American interest in british colonial Empire. (Paragraph No. 5 of telegram to the Dominions.) Proposition,,unless qualified, may have more read into it by the United States than will suitus. Americans have neither a Colonial Empire nor experience of one. We have both, and on a large scale. I agree, in that connection, that it is of great import-ance to make it clear that no arrangement that could be come to would be merelyan Anglo-American (? control), and that any such arrangement would be the equalconcern of all Powers with oversea possessions.  We need to bear in mind possible
reactions of that position on Africa (West Africa and Sudan) so far as France and Germany, or any other Great Power which in the remoter future, in whichwe shall be bound to by this declaration, may establish a position in these areas.And I should be wary of paying too high a price for a hypothetical Americanundertaking to take a share in defence of areas which hitherto we have held withexceedingly light forces, and the fate of which will always in practice be likely tosubordinated to the policy of Great Powers.13. As for line of declaration suggested in penultimate paragraph of telegram to Dominion Prime Ministers, I have touched above on possible violentconflict between United States and Imperial and Indian interests in tariff andeconomic field in post-war period. I would urge most strongly that it is a pointof potential importance. On a further important point, I note that it is suggestedthat Colonial policy is to be &quot; in the best interests of peoples concerned and ofthe world as a whole.&quot; I would urge that we should not tie ourselves to so broada proposition. For we may take it that the United States will regard themselves as likely to be best judges of what the &quot; best interests &quot; are. In the event of any(? general) pooling of Colonial interests such as is now under consideration, Iwould leave judgment of that matter with senior partner in worst [sic: ? each]area. Thus Americans would be senior partners as regards Philippines, and weas regards the West Indies and those African territories in which our interestspredominate over those of any other country. The same is true of the Sudan,though it is not, of course, a Colony.14. I have not attempted to do more in this telegram than commentgenerally, for co-ordination of views of the Dominion Prime Ministers and my own must be done in London. But the issue is of very great importance, and Ishould be grateful if I could continue to be kept in touch with it. If there is anyaspect of this matter on which you would like me to comment further, pleasetelegraph.
