Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1943.142&apos;SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 35.January 20, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.29REVIEW OF BUILDING PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE Minister of Production^ proposal in W.P. (43) 23 is unacceptable.It would mean that the Air Ministry alone would have to bear a greater proportion of the total cut than all the Service, Supply and the Civil Depart-merits put together.2. It would be a mistake to suppose that the latest aircraft programme will reduce the number of airfields required for the expanding Anglo-Americanforce.3. The only category of R.A.F. aircraft of which, as compared with theformer programme, there is likely to be a reduced front-line strength in 1943is the bomber.4. As regards British bomber squadrons, failure to achieve the full production programme had already been largely discounted; in so far as it hadnot, reductions will fall on the overseas programme and will not affect the airfield programme here.5. It is now sufficiently clear that, by the early part of 1944, we shall needall the airfields we are now proposing to construct. We have already agreedto a substantial measure of postponement.6. A reduction of 10,000 in the labour force at the end of January, rising to 30,000 at the end of March, would mean the loss of airfield provision for nearly 20 squadrons.7. In accordance with the directions of the War Cabinet (W.M. (42)167th Conclusions), we are making strenuous efforts to avoid a reduction in the striking power of the Royal Air Force. These efforts would be defeated ifessential airfields were not provided.A. H. M.
