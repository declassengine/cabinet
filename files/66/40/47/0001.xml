As the route was for the most of the way identical with that previouslyused in attacks on Berlin, a harassing raid on the capital by Mosquitoes was alsocarried out in order to deceive the defences for a time as to the real target. Toensure accuracy of bombing on the buildings at Peenemunde which are dispersedover a large area, the attack was delivered, in full moon conditions which gave the maximum opportunity to enemy night fighters.Aircraft arriving early were able to identify the target visually before it wasconcealed by an effective smoke screen. Markers were accurately placed oh the sections of the station which were known to be of outstanding importance,including the living quarters of the expert scientific personnel. Ground defencesat the target were not heavy but, as soon as the enemy realised the real object ofthe attack, night fighters were diverted from Berlin and from as far south asthe Ruhr to intercept the bombers on their return journey.Photographs show very heavy destruction, both in manufacturing buildings and living quarters. In the Northern part of the.station; 27 buildings, includingthe Senior Officers&apos; Mess, were completely destroyed. Nine others, includingthe largest and most important in this. section, were heavily damaged. In theSouthern Sector, one large and important building received two direct hits and several others were damaged by direct hits and blast. Much damage was done to railway tracks and a direct hit was registered on a train. The steam pipe skirtingthe foreshore has been fractured in at least ten places. Large numbers of living and sleeping quarters were destroyed. In one- part of the camp, 90 huts were completely wrecked by fire and H.E. In another, 23 out of 45 large huts forpersonnel were destroyed and others damaged. Print No. 1 shows some of the damage.b
Leverkusen (22nd/23rd August). -It was hoped that the weather would make possible a precision attack onthe I.G. Farben Works at Leverkusen, of the kind delivered against Peenemunde.Unfortunately, there was 10/10 cloud up to 20,000 feet and the attack wasscattered over a wide area.    Enemy defences were also seriously hampered by&apos;cloud and all except five of our aircraft returned safely.Berlin (23rd/24th August).Weather conditions were favourable for the first large-scale attack on Berlin.Visibility was good except for some ground haze, but the built-up area was laterobscured by smoke from numerous and extensive fires. Bombing was wellconcentrated and night plots showed that the S.W. and S. parts of the city werebadly hit. Day photographs taken on the following day added little to this information, as clouds of smoke rising to 20,000 feet obscured practically thewhole of the bombed area (see Print No. 2). Mosquitoes reported that fires were still burning on the night after the attack, and were not entirely extinguishedon the 25th/26th August. No details of the damage effected were permitted tobe published in the German press : a more detailed description of the damageeffected will be given in the next Summary.Nuremberg (27th/28th August).Weather was clear en route although some haze was encountered over the target. Preliminary reports indicate that bombing was at first scattered butbecame more concentrated later.   No assessment of damage can yet be made.Milan (15th/ 16th August).Turin (16th/17th August).The results of these and previous raids on Milan and Turin are describedlater in this Summary.Results of Previous Raids.The Ruhr.Final assessment of the results achieved at Essen (25th/26th July) andMiilheim (22nd/23rd June) amplify previous estimates of the industrial damage caused. The devastation at Krupps is particularly impressive. 110 out of190 buildings were more or less seriously damaged; the results of the attack were as serious as those of all the previous assaults combined. Among the mostimportant items of damage are : ;The pattern-making shop destroyed over an area of about an acre.A machine shop covering 3^ acres gutted.Two other machine shops damaged in previous raids now almost totallydestroyed.All four annealing shops severely damaged or completely destroyed.The Diesel Engine Works, covering more than three acres, totallydestroyed.The most serious damage at Mulheim, apart from the almost completedestruction of the town, is that done to the essential heavy iron and steel industry.The damaged plants include Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. (August Thyssen);Vereinigte Stahlwerke Friedrich Wilhelmshutte; Siemens Schuckert (Turbines).Hamburg.Reports from ground sources continue to show the enormous material and moral damage caused by the heavy attacks on Hamburg. The authorities areattempting to restore some semblance of order and normal life, and appeals to keyworkers and administrators to return to the city are still numerous. The positionquite recently, however, was that more than half the population were workless aswell as homeless. The business centre and all the administrative buildings in theport area were destroyed, with the result that all customs and clearance arrange-ments broke down completely. The port area was closed to traffic partly because,of actual damage to quays, bunker and unloading facilities, partly because of thechaotic, labour situation. Many of the canals are also blocked by sunken barges.Eight submarines on the slips at Blohm and Voss are reported to have been seriously damaged.
Fires are said to have been completely out of control as a result of burst mainsand low pressure, and had to be left to burn themselves out. Only in districts where water tanks had been established were the attempts to limit the conflagrationat all successful.Mannheim.Day cover shows considerable damage as a result of the attack on the9th/10th August. The extensive works of Heinrich Lanz A.G., makers of A.F.V.,artillery, tractors and tank components, have been particularly heavily damaged.(See Print No. 3.) Other damage includes the main station, the Rhenania OssagOil Storage Depot, and a factory producing Diesel engines for warships. TheNorthern half of EG. Farbenindustrie at Ludwigshafen has also been damaged.Barge traffic was severely restricted as a result of damage to the Industrie-hafen and the Verbindungskanal. Through trains still by-passed the main station on the 18th August.Nuremberg.Day photographs show that the main concentration of damage caused bythe attack on lOth/llth August lies in the N.E. part of the town. The totalarea of devastation covers about 185 acres. Direct industrial damage was less important than that caused by the attack on 8th/9th March, but three smallengineering works and three railway stations were hit. Print No. 4 showsdamage at the Rud Chillingworth A.G. works.Milan.In the attacks on 7th/8th, 12th/13th, 14th/15th and 15th/ 16th August very heavy- damage was caused. 350 acres of fully built-up area in the centre of thecity were devastated and some 80 acres in the slightly less-densely populatedzone. Very serious damage was done to the Alfa Romeo Works which, it isestimated, produced 200 aero-engines monthly. The Isotta Fraschini works with a similar output were also hit. The Pirelli Works at Sesto Giovanni, to theNorth of Milan, and the administrative offices and store rooms in the city itselfwere damaged. Other large factories damaged include Bianchi (producinglorries and tractors) and Tallero (producing railway material and electric motors).It is also clear from many sources that the attacks caused much disorganisation-tion and panic among the population. All forms of transport broke down andmass evacuation, largely on foot, is reported. Many fires seem to have continuedunextinguished for days.Prints Nos. 5 and 6 show some of the damage caused.Turin.40 acres of fully built-up area were devastated by the attacks on 7th /8th,12th/13th and 16th/ 17th August. The most serious industrial damage is in theState Railway Workshops; the Royal Arsenal was also hit and one of the Fiatworks was heavily damaged.   The main railway station has suffered very badly.General.A note on the results of the bomber offensive on German war productionduring June 1943 is attached as an annex to this memorandum.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry,lUh September, 1943..ANNEX.Results of the Bomber Offensive on German War Production during june 1943.Assessment of the effects produced by bombing on the German war potentialis slow and necessarily very incomplete. The Ministry of Economic Warfareestimate of results achieved in June, however, gives some idea of the extent towhich output had already been reduced before the destruction of Cologne and hamburg and the renewed attacks on Essen and other Ruhr and Rhinelandtargets in July and August.[26080] - . b 2
Transport.The widespread destruction of rolling-stock, stations, tracks and railway material of all kinds in the railway network of the Ruhr and Rhineland causedby attacks in June led to general dislocation in the transport of goods and passengers by rail. The inability of railways to deliver material on time, combined with attempts at restarting bombed-out undertakings in factories thought to beless vulnerable to air attack, has curtailed industrial production throughoutGermany. Shortage of goods to be moved by rail has simultaneously producedthe appearance of abundant railway stock in the Ruhr itself.Canal traffic in the Ruhr has also been seriously affected both by irregularitiesof water supply resulting from the destruction of the Mbhne and Eder Damsin May and from bomb damage at Minister, Dortmund and elsewhere.Municipal transport throughout the Ruhr was naturally disrupted by bombing with serious consequences to productive activities of all kinds. Manysources refer to increased fatigue due to difficulties in getting to and from work,while the length of journeys has been enormously increased by the destruction ofhouses in industrial centres which has necessitated the dispersal of workers intotemporary barracks outside built-up areas. These difficulties have had reactions in unbombed areas which have been compelled to surrender their local transport on a large scale to fill the gap. Renewed attacks after city centres have been destroyed have also clone heavy damage to the temporary barracks, especially at Essen.Shortage of locomotives as a result both of direct destruction by bombing and of the elimination of production and repair facilities has shown itself in the occupied countries as well as in Germany. In Belgium, 70 supply trains are said to have been halted during a single fortnight from this cause, while coketrains for the Belgian steel works (whose output is urgently needed as a partialreplacement for that destroyed in the Ruhr) have been held up for anything upto 12 days for lack of engines.Public Utilities., Damage to power stations and gas works in the Ruhr was too heavy toI admit of restoration of supplies by emergency repairs or alternative sources ofsupply even where these existed on paper. Whole cities have been deprived of gas and electricity as well as of water for domestic use for lengthy periods. InEssen, for instance, the authorities admitted that large areas were still&apos;withoutgas or water on the 4th July.Coal and Coke. ^It might have been expected that the severe damage done earlier in the yearto the Ruhr steel works,would lead to a surphis of coal and coke for export. Lp.fact, Sweden, Italy and Denmark all failed to receive anything like theirexpectations. Some of the shortage no doubt arises from the transport difficultiesmentioned above. Direct damage to collieries, however, has also been very severe,and is certainly much greater than photographic reconnaissance can establish.Iron and Steel.Post-raid photographs show a very lifeless and inactive appearance in manyRuhr steelworks which do not appear to have suffered anything approachingcomplete destruction: This is the natural consequence not merely of invisibledamage from near misses, but-of all the contributing causes already enumerated;i.e., de-housing of w6rkers, destruction of utilities, breakdown of local transport and general chaos. It is significant&apos; that, while there was no falling off in thedemand for Swedish ore for Western Germany up to the beginning of June,subsequent requirements fell in.some cases to 25 per cent, of normal.Rolling mills have been the section of, the Ruhr steel plants most heavily&apos; damaged by bombing, i^ttempts have been made to supplement them by sendingsemi-products to Belgium for rolling. Some of the product has been sent as farafield as Silesia- which shows that Germany herself, in spite of boasts to thecontrary, has no alternative to replace &quot;Ruhr production for her steelrequirements.
