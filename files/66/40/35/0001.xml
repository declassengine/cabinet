THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET.Copy No.   33W.P. (43) 385.31st August, 1943.WAR CABINET.POSTAL COMMUNICATION WITH INDIA.Memorandum by the Postmaster-General.1. The War Cabinet asked, in W.M. (43) 118th Conclusions, Minute 6, for areport on the general condition of postal communication with India; and Icirculate accordingly for the information of my colleagues the following informa-tion, in which the Secretary of State for India concurs.2.   The postal services available for communication with India are -(a) Surface mail postage rate l\d. to Forces (2^d. to civilians) for thefirst ounce and Id. for each additional ounce.(b) Airgraphs 3d. each to Forces (Bd. to civilians).(c) Air letters Qd. each (to Forces only).(d) Air mail letters As. 3d. per half ounce : postcards Id. (to Forces and3. Surface Mail. The War Office now control the shipping accommodationon all sailings to India by other than His Majesty&apos;s ships; consequently, the surface mails can be sent only by ships on which the War Office allots the necessaryspace. There is, however, no reason to think that the mail service has sufferedunder this arrangement. Despatches are made about 2 to 4 times a month. Whenall ships for India sailed via the Cape, the average time of transmission was9-13 weeks; but the mails despatched since early in May last have in most if not all cases been conveyed via the Mediterranean, with an average time of trans-mission of about 7 weeks.A schedule of recent despatches and of arrivals in India is attached(Appendix A).Routeing and Loading. The routeing of the ships and the stowage of themails on board are matters outside the control of the Post Office.Responsibility for routeing rests with the Admiralty.As regards stowage of the mails, the responsibility varies according to the category of the ship. There are two categories, viz., (1) those carrying essentiallywar material or personnel and loaded by the Sea Transport Division of theMinistry of War Transport; and (2) those loaded on civil service by the linercompanies concerned, which may carry both civil and military cargo. For ships in category (1) the loading is the responsibility of the Ministry of War Transport;for the other category it is the responsibility of the liner company concerned; butin both cases due regard is paid to the urgency of the mails and the need for allowing for them the maximum accommodation possible.The Admiralty have recently appointed Port Liaison Officers whose duty itis to watch over and advise as regards the stowage of mails on all ships.4. Airgraphs are normally despatched to India three times a week, theaverage transmission time being about 8 days from this country to the Base inIndia, to which must be added, the time required for the photographic process,and this varies with the size of the consignment. Airgraph films are invariablyconveyed by the fastest air services available. A schedule of recent despatches andarrivals in India is attached (Appendix B).5. Air Letters (i.e., letters on special light-weight forms price Qd.) forIndia are despatched daily to Lyneham Airport for conveyance by the dailyB.O.A.C. Dakota services to North Africa, thence by air to India via Cairo.  the civilians).[26011]
average transmission time of the mails by this route is about 11 days. A schedule of recent despatches and arrivals in India is attached (Appendix C).6. Air Mail Letters. Since the closing of the Mediterranean in June 1940it has not been possible to convey all the way by air the heavy weight of ordinaryair mail letters to India and the other countries in Africa and Asia served by theEmpire Air Services; and the mails have had to be conveyed from this country by sea to a port in Africa for onward conveyance by. air.Until recently the air mails for India have been forwarded by sea to South&apos;Africa, thence by the twice-weekly B.O.A.C. air services from Durban toCalcutta. By this route letters should normally have reached India inseven-eight weeks after despatch from this country, but in practice this has, fromtime to time, been considerably exceeded. This is partly because the ship con-surveying the mails to South Africa is sometimes delayed or diverted owing to war conditions and partly because the section of the route normally covered by airhad, on occasions, to be covered by sea owing to lack of aircraft capacity for carriage of mails. In these circumstances it has occasionally happened thatsurface mails for India have reached India before Is. 3d. air mails despatchedabout the same time or even earlier. But since the spring of this year air con-veyance has been regularly available on the easterly section of the route.During the past few weeks a further improvement has come into sight.Since the despatch by sea to South Africa, made on the 7th August (Appendix D),arrangements have been made to forward ordinary air mail correspondence forIndia by sea through the Mediterranean to Egypt, thence by air. As ordinarymails for India will travel as far as Egypt by the same route, it is anticipatedthat the&apos; air mail service to India will, in future, provide up to two weeksacceleration over the surface mail service.The whole question of the future of the Is. 3d. air mail service to Africa andAsia is, at present, being considered in consultation with the Air Ministry in thelight of the reopening of the Mediterranean.H.
