Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (43) 399.18th September, 1943.WAR CABINET.\7POLITICAL AFFAIRS IN CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I attach, for the information of my colleagues, a despatch from the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Canada about the Canadian political situation.A year has passed since I sent you a comprehensive account of the domesticpolitical situation in Canada. The plebiscite on Conscription for Overseas service had then recently been held, and the Parliamentary debates which followed had produced an awkward and even dangerous situation. The Government introducedlegislation which did no more than empower them to effect conscription for over-seas service by Order-in-Council whenever they deemed the step necessary. Yetthey only succeeded in passing this Bill by paying the doubly unwelcome price of losing the votes of most of their French-Canadian supporters and gaining the votes of the Conservative Opposition. The threat of an Order-in-Council hunglike a sword of Damocles above the Canadian people. If conscription were introduced the nation would be divided into two bitterly hostile factions theAnglo-Saxon Canadians supporting it and the French-Canadians opposing it.A fight between them on that issue might have inflicted a mortal wound on thenation.2. The sword of Damocles still hangs in mid-air. It has got rather rusty inthe meantime and people have even been inclined to forget its existence. Thecourse of the war has as yet made conscription for the Canadian Army overseasunnecessary. This has been so apparent that even the Conservative Oppositionhave ceased their agitation for it, Thus the most controversial issue in Canadianpolitics has for the time beingvat least disappeared from practical discussion.3. This is partly because, as I foreshadowed, in my despatch No. 463 of the4th August last year, it has become increasingly clear that Canada&apos;s magnificentwar effort was not being immediately prejudiced by any shortage of men for thearmy, but by insufficient labour in the fields, forests, mines and munitionsfactories. The problem of organising man-and-woman power in this vast country with a comparatively small and scattered population is peculiarly difficult, andthe Canadian Government have not been as successful in tackling it as they havebeen in other parts of the war effort.4. Arguments about man-power policy in general do not, however, rouse thepolitical passions which debates on Conscription for overseas military service inparticular do. They do not produce anything like the same racial cleavage. Sopolitics during the last twelve months&apos; have lost something of their heat andbitterness. Although the Opposition parties dutifully criticise the Governmentfor various alleged sins of omission or commission, the&apos;Governments position hasC.

appeared to increase steadily in strength. It has become generally recognisedthat there :,va&amp; little chance of overthrowing the Liberal Administration duringthe war. The Conservative Party, as well as the smaller Opposition parties, havereconciled themselves to this. Their efforts are now concentrated on (1) patrioticsupport and stimulation of the national war effort, and (2) party plans forwinning the first post-war General Election. But this increased strength of theGovernment in Parliament was not a faithful reflection of opinion in the country.In the constituencies remarkable changes were taking place. I shall write about these later in this despatch.5. In the meantime another circumstance contributed towards a bettertemper in politics. In my Despatch No. 463 I referred to the defeat of Mr. ArthurMeighen, the leader of the Conservative Party, in a by-election early last year.Mr. Meighen remained leader until a Party Convention met in Winnipeg almosta year later. At its opening session he announced his resignation. Nothing inthis statesman&apos;s stormy and luckless career became him so well as the manner ofhis dying. His speech of retirement was wise and dignified. The Conventionpaid him a pious tribute and then proceeded to choose a new leader. after several clays of earnest search and negotiation they unanimously elected a new-comer to Federal politics. Mr. John Bracken, the Premier of Manitoba.6. This change in leadership more *or less synchronised with another.Whilst Mr. Meighen was seeking to re-enter Parliament Mr. Hanson had con-tinued as Acting Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. When aToronto by-election extinguished the prospect of Mr. Meighen&apos;s return and theWinnipeg Convention extinguished his own chance of selection as Mr. Meighen&apos;ssuccessor. Mr. Flanson pressed his resignation of an acting position which he had long wished to vacate. Since Mr. Bracken was no more in the House of Commonsthan Mr. Meighen. a new Acting Leader of the Opposition was required. Theparty elected Mr. Gordon Graydon to the post.7. -Mr. Meighen and Mr. Hanson were both inspired by a strong personalaversion of Mr. Mackenzie King. They missed no opportunity of expressingthis in biting terms in public. Mr. Mackenzie King was far from incapable ofreplying in kind. Consequently Canadian politics were embittered by a virulentpersonal feud. Neither Mr. Bracken nor Mr. Graydon have allowed personalitiesto play an undue part in their speeches or policies. They attack the Governmentand defend their own party with good temper on the merits of wdxatever politicalprinciples may be involved. So much of the earlier bitterness has disappearedfrom political warfare in Parliament and outside, although violently abusiveattacks on the Prime Minister are still maintained by some individual Conserva-tive leaders and newspapers in the Provinces. The general atmosphere ispleasanter than it was.8. The elevation of Mr. Bracken to the Leadership of the principal Opposi-tion party introduces a new personality to Federal politics. Previously he wasonly one of the two or three foremost figures in Provincial government. Hishistory is quickly told. In 1922 he was President of the Manitoba AgriculturalCollege in Winnipeg. That year,the new United Farmers of Manitoba organisa-tion won an overwhelming victory over the Liberal and Conservative Parties inthe Provincial elections. They found themselves in the embarrassing position ofbeing asked to form a government without any obvious leader to guide them.They asked the President of the Agricultural College whether he would like tobecome Premier. He accepted, won a by-election, and has kept the farmers in office ever since. His reign as Premier of Manitoba had thus lasted for twenty years, and might have continued for as many more years as he chose. He was nota Consm vative. On the contrary, he described himself as a Liberal-Progressiveand was a leader of the prairie farmers, who consistently opposed the Conserva-tive Party&apos;s high tariff policy. Up to-the outbreak of war in 1939 the ProvincialConservative Party were amongst his opponents. In 1941, however, he broadenedhis Government to make it a coalition in which Farmer-Progressive, Conservative,Liberal and Labour members co-operateI under his conciliatory and prudentleadership. During the conscription controversy he pleased the Conservatives byhis outspoken criticism of Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s policy.9. Provincial politics are a different matter to national politics, and it has yet to be seen whether at the age of sixty Mr. Bracken, an acknowledged master of the former&apos;, can adapt himself to the strange problems and arts of the latter.In conversation with him I used to be astonished at bis ignorance of world
affairs, and even of some national affairs. But since becoming the leader of a nationalparty he has earnestly set himself to study these matters. He has no dramaticqualities. He is cautious and slow-minded. But he is also shrewd, sensible andsincere. Fine oratory is not within his powers. But he often expresses in plainlanguage the not very complicated thoughts of the common man. His attitude to affairs since his emergence as a national leader has made a favourable impres-sion on the general public, and has been a distinct influence in producing a revivalin the fortunes of the Conservative Party.10. He is first and foremost a farmers&apos; cha,mpion. But in his new role he is taking pains to make himself more widely representative. His opinions as anagriculturalist, however, greatly influence his outlook on national and inter-national questions, and are at present having a considerable effect on his party&apos;policy. They may later cause a clash between him and some of his&apos; moreorthodox Conservative followers. He believes in low tariffs, whilst they have been accustomed to advocate high tariffs. This difference of opinion brought him intoconflict in the past with Conservative leaders like Lord Bennett. But there is a school of younger Conservatives whose opinions veer towards freer trade, andwho on other questions also take a more liberal view than many of their oldercolleagues. These men played an important part in securing Mr. Bracken&apos;selection as leader of the party, and he made his own sympathies clear by insistingas a condition of his acceptance of the position that the party&apos;s name be changed to &quot; Progressive-Conservative.&apos;&apos;11. Immediately on his election he resigned his Premiership of Manitoba.But so far he has not attempted to enter the Federal House of Commons. Hewould like, if possible, to stand for a western constituency. Few of these, however,are now safe for a Conservative even with the prefix &quot; Progressive.&quot; In any case,he has probably been wise to avoid fighting a by-election hitherto. If he has beenrestrained partly by timidity about submitting himself to the electors (for the example of Mr. Arthur Meighen&apos;s defeat is an awful warning to him), his delayis prudent for other reasons also. Had he precipitately entered the Parliamentaryarena to do battle with so consummate a Parliamentarian as Mr. mackenzie king, he might have demonstrated too clearly his innocence of Federal affairs.Instead, he has been learning his new job, undergoing a belated apprenticeshipin Dominion government. He has visited every settled part of the country,studied the varied local aspects of national problems on the spot, and made himselfknown to large numbers of his fellow-countrymen everywhere. If and when heenters Parliament he will be able to claim a more recent and thorough personalacquaintance with the country than can the rather recluse Prime Minister.12. In the meantime, Mr. Graydon has led the Opposition in Parliament.He is industrious, fair-minded and likeable. Between them these two newleaders, though they have not yet shown great distinction, command more respectthan has attached to Conservative leaders for a decade. They have given a freshlease of life to their party. But if Mr. Bracken is to maintain his position, let alone improve it, he must soon fight a by-election and enter Parliament. If hedelays much longer, people will draw the conclusion that he is afraid to test theopinion of the voters, and he will lose for himself and his party the ground whichthey have recently gained. 013. Whilst the Pi&apos;ogressive-Conservatives have thus been improving their prospects another party has been making more remarkable progress. I have written in earlier despatches about the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.This is the cumbersome title of the Socialist Party. It is a comparatively newforce in Canadian politics, and until the other day had only 9 out of 245 members in the Federal House of Commons. Its history during the last two years providesan interesting parallel with the growth of the British Labour Parly prior to itsassumption of office in 1924. Its leader; and supporters are animated by thespirit of political pioneers. They have ao backing from any popular newspaper.But they conduct ceaseless propaganda,by means of public meetings in every partof the country. Work for the party isvdone by countless unpaid and enthusiasticvolunteers. At first shunned by the Trade Unions, they are now getting muchofficial support from them. They are bitterly denounced by their now thoroughlyalarmed opponents in Parliament and the Press as Communists, Fascists,Atheists, Revolutionists and various other types of bogey. They are, in fact,moderate constitutional Evolutionary Socialists in the best British tradition.And, in spite of all their critics&apos; vituperation, they are making rapid advances in popularity.[26091J b 2
1.4. They are well led. Mr. M. J. Coldwell, the President of their nationalorganisation and leader of their Parliamentary party, came to western canadian  his youth as an immigrant from Britain. By profession a school-teacher, heafterwards entered politics in Saskatchewan as leader of the ProvincialCo-operative Commonwealth Federation. In 1935 he was one of the earliestCo-operative Commonwealth Federation members to be elected to the FederalHouse of Commons. Now 55. he is in his intellectual prime. Perhaps he is stilltoo much of a school-master in politics, too academic. But he has shown himselfa skilful politician and Parliamentarian. Moderate in counsel, forceful in debate,firm in action and likeable in character, he is an immense asset to his party.Though more respected than popular, he is the unrivalled leader of his rapidiyincreasing army of supporters.15. A year ago the C.C.F. gained so many seats in the Provincial elections in British Columbia that they became the Opposition in the local legislature and forced the Liberal and Conservative parties to form a coalition against them.Shortly afterwards they gained some victories in the Provincial elections innovations Scotia. A few weeks later one of their candidates astonished Canada bydefeating Mr. Meighen. in his by-election for the Federal House in what wasconsidered a good Conservative seat in Toronto. Since then various further signsand portents have indicated that they were, steadily increasing their strength inmany parts of the country. Finally, this month their remarkable gains in theOntario Provincial elections and in some Federal by-elections have delighted their supporters as much as they have shocked their opponents.16. The Ontario Provincial election results were announced on the5th August. Representation of the three principal parties in the legislaturebefore the polls was as follows : Liberals 64, Progressive-Conservatives 23.C.C.F. 0. Their representation when the polls were declared was : Liberals 14,Progressive-Conservatives 38. C.C.F. 34. The Progressive-Conservative victory over the Liberals can be attributed in considerable degree to the normal processof the swing of the pendulum. A Liberal Government had ruled Ontario for nine years and the voters desired a change. But the C.C.F. gains reveal something-more significant than that. They mark the effective entry of a powerful nevforce in Canadian politics.17. This fact was further emphasised a few days later when the results of four federal by-elections v,rere announced. Two of these took place in QuebecProvince and two on the prairies. Before the by-elections the Liberals held allfour seats. Now they have lost them all. For some reason best known to them-selves the Progressive-Conservatives did not nominate any candidates. TheC.C.F. won the two prairie seats whilst the Quebec pair were divided between a french-Canadian Nationalist and a Communist. Since then the C.C.F. have gained another striking victory by winning the Provincial constituency inManitoba which Mr. Bracken vacated when he became leader of the Progressive-Conservatives.18. These heaps of straws in the wind indicate which way Canadianpolitical opinion is blowdng. They represent a severe defeat for the Liberal Party.They do not threaten the Federal Governments position immediately, for it hasan overwhelming majority in the House of Commons, and there is no urgentcontroversial matter on which feeling is strongly against it. But these ballotsundoubtedly express a general discontent with the Liberals. Unless Mr. mackenzie king and his colleagues can do something to restore the position their Governmentwill go down to defeat whenever the voters have an opportunity to pronounce theirverdict iri a General Election after the war.19. The most significant feature of these events is, obviouslv, not the losses of the Liberals or the gains of the Progressive-Conservatives, butthe triumphant progress of the C.C.F. Recently their doctrine has madehuge numbers of converts. This is an example of the swing of opinion tothe Left which is now taking place in many, though not all, countries. More-over, the C.C.F. makes a strong appeal to the young generation not only becauseits policy attracts them but also because it offers them a political career. &quot; The twoolder parties are ruled by the older generation, who in Canada have generallyrefused to admit young politicians to share in the responsibilities of office. TheC.C.F., on the other hand, promote young men and women to high posts in their organisation. Close students of these affairs in Canada say that the C.C.F&apos;s appeal to agricultural Canada is still comparatively weak, but that they havereached a stage of development where they can win a great majority &quot;of the
industrial constituencies outside Quebec Province. Quebec has a character all itsown, and will respond di ITerently from the rest of Canada to the political problemsof these times. I shall write about that later in this despatch. As regards thecountry as a whole Mr. Ilsley, the Minister of Finance, who is a careful judge,told, me the other day that if a General Election were held now the C.C.F. wouldwin more seats than either the Liberals or the Conservatives, though they wouldnot gain a clear majority.20. Canada is therefore on the eve of great changes in her party system.The only certainty is that the C.C.F. will continue to gain in strength. Whatthen will happen to the two older parties 1 Many Liberals and Progressive-Conservatives who share alarm at the growth of the C.C.F. are already urging that they should form a coalition together against the common enemy. Nodoubt this will happen sooner or later in some form or other. Will the Liberalsabsorb the Progressive-Conservatives, or the Progressive-Conservatives absorb the Liberals ? Two years ago most people would have said that the weakConservative Party was doomed, and that the powerful Liberals were the futureparty of the Right. Certainly whilst Mr. Mackenzie King remains at the headof the Liberal Party there is no likelihood of its making any compromise withthe Progressive-Conservatives. He regards &apos;&apos; the Tories &apos;&apos; with an old-fashionedpartisan hatred. His instincts are radical, and he has told me more than once that he would rather work with the C.C.F. than with the Conservatives. Buthe may not lead the Liberals much longer. At the end of next year he will attainthree-score years and ten. &quot;By next summer he will have been Prime Ministerfor more than seventeen years and beaten the record hitherto held by the firstPrime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald. And, with any luck, thewar will be over within a reasonable time after that. When he has played thepart which he hopes to play in the restoration of peace he can retire to writevoluminous Memoirs. .21. Though the Liberal Party has a number of able Ministers, none canfill Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s place and hold the party together in a severe crisis.In spite of all the changes of these times he remains the dominant personal forcein Canadian politics. His retirement will bring to a head the greatest crisisthat the Canadian Liberal Party has ever had to face. For the British Parlia-mentary system does not work satisfactorily when power is divided more orless equally between three parties. The tendency will be to move back to acontest between two oarties. In that situation it is usually the &quot; middle &quot; party that dwindles. Si .. 3 of its members move to the Left, others to the Right.Whether he intended it deliberately for this purpose or not, Mr. Bracken&apos;schange of his party&apos;s name and policy to Progressive-Conservative may turnout to have been a capital move for attracting Liberals, and to be a decisiveinfluence in settling that it is the Liberal and not the Conservative party whichdisappears in the process of closing the Individualist ranks to fight Socialismin Canada.22. The future of party politics in Canada can only be a matter ofspeculation at this moment of transition. But I should not be surprised if aprophecy which Mr. Power, the Air Minister and perhaps the shrewdestpolitician in the country after the Prime Minister made to me the other eveningcomes true. &quot; We&apos;ll all be loyal to the Liberal party,&quot; he said, &quot; whilst thePrime Minister leads it. Then it will disappear. We&apos;ll split up. I and twoor three others will join the C.C.F., and the rest of my august colleagues willjoin the Progressive-Conservatives.&quot;23. Yet the problem is not so simple as that. If the change suggested inparagraphs 20, 21 and 22 above takes place everywhere else in Canada, it willnot occur in Quebec Province. This is a large exception, both quantitatively andqualitatively. Quantitatively the Province returns more than a quarter of theMembers of the Dominion Blouse of Commons. Qualitatively it represents theimportant French-Canadian section of the population. Special sentiments swayopinion there. For a generation the French-Canadians have been passionatelyopposed to the Conservative Party because that Party offended them on the all-important conscription issue. This prejudice would be too deep for French-Canadian Liberals to join the Progressive-Conservative Party just because newpolitical alignments were taking place in the Dominions and Liberals elsewherewere adopting that course. At the same time the Roman Catholic bishops andpriests in Quebec are so hostile to Socialism that their flocks are not likely tosupport the C.C.F.&apos;s efforts to establish a new Heaven on earth for fear of being
permanently consigned to Hell afterwards. In these circumstances no one cantell what will happen in Quebec if the tendency in the rest of Canada is to revert to a two-party system in which the Progressive-Conservatives and the C.C.F.are the protagonists. Perhaps the Liberal Party will continue to flourish as an almost exclusively Quebec Party. Or perhaps a majority of French-Canadianswill form themselves into a new &quot;French nationalist&quot; party devoted to theprotection of their racial way of life and their rights as a minority. In that case they might play a similar bedevilling role in Canadian politics to that played bythe Irish Nationalists in the House of Commons at Westminster before 1914.This appears at present to be a distinct danger. Several nationalist organisa-tions, of which the Bloc Populaire is the strongest, are appealing with considerable success to French-Canadian voters. The first real trial of strengthbetween them and the reigning Liberal Party will come when the ProvincialElections are held in a few months&apos; time.24. If Federal politics do develop as suggested above, it may be that in thelong run the French-Canadians will slowly be forced by the exigencies of party politics to accommodate themselves to the main trends of Canadian opinionelsewhere. No people in the country are by nature more truly conservative thanthe French-Canadian agricultural population, and if the Conscription issue couldsomehow be forgotten many of them might gravitate to their natural place in the progressive-Conservative Party. At the. same time the industrial workers inthis Province which is becoming steadily more industrialised may well rebel later on against the political as distinct from the religious dictatorship of theirpriests, and join the C.C.F. But if such developments take place in Quebec, theywill come much more slowly than elsewhere. Who can foretell the future inthese unsettled times? All I can say is that in due course some future HighCommissioner will have interesting things to report on these matters to some future Secretary of State.I have, &amp;c.MALCOLM MacDONALD.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, London.
