(43) 37826th August, 1943.WAR CABINETMINIMUM AGE FOR MILITARY SERVICE IN AN OVERSEASTHEATRE OF war memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. It has become necessary to review the minimum age at which troops may besent overseas, as a result both of the general shortage of manpower for the Servicesand industry, and in particular of the lowering of the age for compulsory service to18 years.2. The present policy, which has been declared in the House of Commons, is thatno soldier shall be sent overseas under 19 years of age. The limit applies to whole unitsgoing abroad, but in fact, soldiers are not usually sent in drafts before reaching theage of 19J. This policy was laid down when men were called up for compulsory service at 20, and was continued when the age fell to 19. If it is still maintained inspite of the further lowering of the calling-up age, it will prevent the Army from makingthe most economical and efficient use of the available material, short as that material,at the best, is bound to be.3. Volunteers for the Army are nearly all under the age of 18 years and 3 months,and a high proportion of the compulsory intake consists of men who have just reachedthe call-up age of 18.4. In allotting the intakes to arms, it is necessary that the younger and fitter men should be posted to the main fighting arms, i.e., those likely to incur the heaviestcasualties, and therefore making the largest demands for drafts; the fighting arms,therefore, with the biggest operational commitments should get the bulk of the youngermen. In the special case of infantry there is at present a deficiency of some thousandsin field formations caused by an increase of personnel in the establishment of riflebattalions and the creation of the support organization.5. Under the present policy, after completion of primary and corps training, menof 18 years 10 months and over are posted to Reserve Divisions, and after two monthsfurther training are sent overseas to maintain the Field Force. Those under the age of18 years 10 months, on completion of primary and corps training, must be postedsomewhere. They cannot be posted to Reserve Divisions as these provide overseasdrafts for the Mediterranean and other theatres and must contain mature soldiers only.They should not be posted to Lower Establishment Divisions as these formations willbe the only source from which the B.E.F. in .Europe can be reinforced..; Hitherto,they have been posted to units of the Field Force, since these were likely to remain at home long enough to enable &quot; immatures &quot; to reach the age of, 19;; but clearly theycan no longer be posted to the B.E.F. itself from the moment that it is likely toproceed overseas. In fact, we cannot now afford to keep young, fit soldiers at home for much longer than it takes to complete their primary and corps training. As the call-up age is now 18, it follows that the overseas age should not be higher than 18J.If it remains at 19 we shall inevitably have many thousands of trained young, fitsoldiers pegged down at home and yet be unable to meet our reinforcement commit-ments in the Indian, Mediterranean and European theatres. Moreover, the constantcross-posting of &quot; matures &quot; to Field Force units in replacement of &quot;immatures &quot; willhave most damaging effects oh Field Force units just when they are being prepared for
6. The minimum period of training at primary and corps training centres is four months. This results in men of the 18 year class being held for a possible maximum of eight months (or longer if they are under 18 on joining) as trained soldiers before being eligible for service overseas.On 30th June, 1943, there were some 48,000 soldiers in the Army who were under19 years of age. By 1st January, 1944, these men will have completed training,but there will still be 17,500 between 18J-19 years, 3,500 between 18-18^, and a fewunder 18.It is impossible accurately to forecast the numbers of men who will still be under 19on the 1st May, 1944, as we do not yet know the composition of the Army intakes for theremainder of this year. A rough estimate of the position on 1st May, 1944 indicates that there will&apos;still be over 18,000 fully trained men under 19 years of age on thatdate and that the bulk of these 18,000 would be available if the age limit for draftingoverseas was reduced to 18L7. When preparing Territorial Army divisions for service in France in early 1940,owing to the inclusion of a large number of &apos;&apos; immatures &quot;, a similar situation con-fronted us, which led to serious difficulties and last minute improvisations, and greatlyaffected the efficiency of the units concerned.8. If the age for service overseas is lowered to 18the gain in men immediately available on 1st January, 1944, is 17,500.If the age for service overseas remains at 19:  (a) the main fighting arms of the B.E.F. will require a considerable number ofmen to replace those under 19 who are now serving in ExpeditionaryForce units; ......(&amp;) the maintenance of overseas forces, including the B.E.F., will constitute areinforcement commitment which we may well be unable to meet fully.9. The proposal to Tower the age limit is supported by the practice in the other two Services (except as regards the Royal Marines) and by that adopted by the Armyduring the last war.(a) In the Royal Navy, the only restriction is that which required the parents&apos;consent if boys under 17 are sent abroad. In practice, a number of sailorsare serving in ships based on home and foreign stations at the age of 18.(6) The Royal Air Force allows men of 18 to go overseas, but requires them topass a stiff medical examination first.(c) The Royal Marines follow the same rules as the Army.   But a proposal madeby the First Lord of the Admiralty that some of them should be sent on a combined operation before reaching the age of 19 was rejected by the WarCabinet on 23rd November, 1942, as likely to occasion criticism inParliament.(d) During most of the last war, soldiers could be drafted overseas at 18^ yearsof age provided they had had four months&apos; training. The age limit was raised to 19 years for officer reinforcements in 1916, and also for soldierson 1st September, 1918, but those of 18^ already abroad were not recalled.In this connection, however, it may be pointed out that, in the first part ofthe last war, there was no conscription, and later, casualties were so heavythat this may have made the practice easier to defend.10. Parliamentary statements in this war may be summarized as follows:- (a) On 3rd September, 1939, Mr. Hore-Belisha gave a pledge in the House:  (i) that no soldier would be sent overseas under 19;(if) that no soldier called up under the National Service Act, 1939, wouldbe sent overseas under the age of 20 without the House being informed.(6) On 2nd December, 1941, the Prime Minister asked that the Government mightbe released from the second pledge, and the silence of the House was taken. as assent.(c) On 22nd October, 1942, Mr. Bevin told the House that &quot;the reduction in theage of calling up does nOt affect the minimum age, namely 19, at which men called up to the Army are posted for service abroad&quot;.11. To sum up, the chief points are these:-  !%,.;(a) From the military point of view there seems no alternative but to lower from19 to i8  years the permissive age for drafting to overseas theatres of operations. Failing such a change, adequate reinforcements for overseas,including the B.E.F., may not be available when required.
(b) The proposal to reduce the age to 18^ goes no further than the practice in allbut the last two months of the last war.(c) Even in this war, the two other Services send personnel overseas at a lowerage than i8-g-.(d) The four months&apos; training qualification of the last war will be more thancovered by the minimum time taken up in this war by primary and corpstraining.(e) The new policy, if approved, would be applied in the first instance only in theEuropean theatre of operations.(/) The need for the proposed change is one implication of the general shortage of manpower, and is the corollary, at this stage of operational planning,of the reduction of the calling up age to 18.12. For these reasons I invite the War Cabinet to agree that the House be askedto approve the change in policy suggested above, namely that the minimum age formilitary service overseas be reduced from 19 to 18^ years.P.
