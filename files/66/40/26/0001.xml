THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET. cope no.^W.P (43) 376.2Uh August, 1943.WAR CABINET.SIXTH REPORT OF THE SHIPPING COMMITTEE.tt &amp;a 0JUr Fifth Report -issued in APril (WR &apos;(43) 153) we dealt with theUnited Kingdom import position for the year 1943. The present Report sets outthe results achieved during the first half of this year, reviews the position for thewhole year and gives a preliminary forecast for the first half of 1944.The First Half of 1943.Imports.2. Imports during the first six months of 1943 amounted to some11-6 million tons, of which some 1-6 million tons wras carried in tonnageprovided by the Americans as direct assistance to our import programme. the division of these imports on a Departmental basis was as follows : Million tons.Food     ...........       ...      ...      5&apos;40Materials        ...............      5-36Munitions and Miscellaneous ...       ...        -85Total............      ...     11-613. In our Fifth Report we estimated that imports during this period would amount to 11 0 million tons, of which 1-6 million tons would be direct American&apos;assistance. American assistance has turned out to be very close to the figureoriginally estimated, and the increase in imports is largely due to losses of British-controlled tonnage proving lower than had been -allowed for. In addition, theimport figures include some 100,000 tons of food and raw materials, offloaded inthis country as a result of the interruption of shipments to Russia by the Northernroute; This, of course, sets up a contingent liability to arrange for the carriage of an equal volume of goods to Russia later on.Import Requirements.4. In our Fourth Report, written in January 1943 (W.P. (43) 28) we assessedimport requirements for the first half of 1943 at 12-5 million tons. The followingtable shows upon what assumptions regarding consumption and stock policy that total was built up, and compares these estimates with the actual experiencefor the period in question.[25964] b

In our Fourth Report we recommended that a minimum of 5 - 0 million tons of imports should be assured to Food. In the event it was found possiblesubstantially to exceed this minimum though imports still fell somewhat short ofthe import requirements as estimated in that Report. The effect on food stocksof this small short-fall in imports was, however, more than made up by a short-fallin net consumption of imported foods amounting to almost 400,000 tons belowthe original estimate.6. Net consumption of materials also fell some 3-400,000 tons short of theoriginal estimate, but in this case the short-fall in imports was still greater and stocks fell over the period by almost 300,000 tons more than had been planned.Subsequent to our Fourth Report, however, it was agreed by /the Minister ofProduction at a meeting of the Lord President&apos;s Committee in January 1943(L.P. (43) 5th Meeting) that it would, if necessary, be possible to make do with an import of only 5 - 5 million tons during the first half of 1943, as compared with the - 0 million tons envisaged in our Report. Achieved imports, at 5-36 million tons,were, therefore, only 140,000 tons less than this reduced requirement.Stocks.7. The stock position at the 30th June, 1943, was not unsatisfactory. food stocks had risen by almost 400,000 tons compared with the beginning of the year,and were some 1 -12 million tons above the minimum safe levels for that time of theyear as estimated by the Ministry of Food.t Materials stocks, although sufferinga fall of almost 800,000 tons over the period, were still some 2-1 million tonsabove the minimum distributional levels. Over the eighteen months&apos; period endingmid-1943 stocks fell by only some 3 million tons, as compared with the maximumreduction of 4 million tons regarded as permissible by the Lord President in his report to the War Cabinet in July 1942 (W.P. (42) 294).  11943 as a Whole.Import Requirements.8. In our Fifth Report we estimated import requirements for the year at 26-4 million tons. After considering this Report the War Cabinet decided in April 1943 (WM. (43) 57th Conclusions), that in our shipping discussions withthe Americans, the figure of 26 - 0 million tons rather than 26 - 4 million tons shouldbe quoted as our import requirement. Out of the 26 million tons, 11-0 million tons was regarded as the appropriate share of Food, 13 million tons of Materials, and2 million tons of Munitions, &amp;c. The estimates for consumption and home pro-duction of importable goods have recently been recalculated and it now appearsf Minimum stocks are calculated only for a limited number of foods. Stocks of these foodsrose in the first half of 1943 by 8-900,000 tons.
that an import programme of the contemplated size and Departmental compositionwould entail stock changes as shown in the following table :  FoodMaterialsMunitions, &amp;c.NetConsumptionof Imports10 012-320Million tons.import programme.11:013020StockChanges.+ 1.-0-f- -7Total   .......      24-3 26-0 +1-7(A detailed analysis by commodities is given in Appendix A.)9. Net consumption of imported food is now put some 400,000 tons lower than in our Fifth Report. Net consumption of imported materials falls about900,000 tons short of our previous estimate mainly by reason of an upwardrevision in estimated home production of steel and timber. Thanks to theserevisions an import of 26 million would, if fully achieved, result in food, stocks at the end of 1943 some 300,000 tons, and materials stocks some 500,000 tonshigher than in our Fifth Report we thought necessary. Bearing in mind,however, the increased tempo of the war, and in particular the possibility that emergency needs of liberated territories may need to be met at an earlier datethan previously contemplated, we regard these stocks as in no way excessive.*Imports.10. In our Fifth Report we estimated that on certain assumptions,including 7 million tons of direct American assistance to our import programme, we could import some 26 million tons in 1943. At the washington conference in May, the military use of United Nations shipping was planned in great detail, and military claims on our tonnage were deter-mined in such a way as to permit British-controlled shipping, with prescribedUnited States assistance, to achieve the target of 26 million tons of imports.One of the arrangements made in Washington was that if certain contingentmilitary commitments (estimated as equivalent to 98 sailings on the North Atlanticin 1943 and 70 sailings in 1944), were met out of British-controlled tonnage, the resulting loss of importing capacity should be made good by additional american assistance. We have recently reviewed the tonnage position and estimate thatit should be possible on certain assumptions listed in Appendix B assumptionswhich imply the provision of British-controlled tonnage to meet the shipping-burden involved in the above-mentioned operations substantially to implement the import programme&apos; of 26 million tons. Recent increases in military andquasi-military demands above the levels planned at Washington, however, willmake it necessary to draw upon some or all of the compensating american assistance then promised. Owing to certain adjustments, made at Washington,between American aid to our military and civil needs respectively, the volumeof direct assistance to the United Kingdom dry import programme for 1943 isnow estimated at 6-8 million tons.11. The principal explanation of the upward revision in our estimate of the importing capacity of British-controlled tonnage is the fact that losses have sofar been below the levels assumed in the earlier estimates. This favourableexperience has led to a downward revision in the agreed United Nations lossrate estimate for the rest of the year. All factors taken together give rise to anincrease in British-controlled tonnage expected to be available for carryingmilitary and civil cargoes in the second, half of the year amounting to some750,000 deadweight tons.12. The estimate of imports given in paragraph 10 is, of course, based onthe assumption that high priority cargo will be available, in adequate amount,in ,the loading areas specified in the import programmes. We have set up aSub-Committee to look into the problem of cargo availability and the First Report* This does not-mean that relief demands of liberated countries should automaticallv bemet by means of re-exports from this country. Some drain on our stocks for this purpose is inevitable, but. from a shipping point of view, it is desirable&apos;that wherever possible there shouldbe direct shipment from the source of supply to the area where the goods are needed.[25964] B 2
of this Sub-Committee reveals that, after allowance has been made for adequateseaboard stocks, there may be a shortage of effective supplies available for importinto this country in 1943 from North America amounting to some half a million tons. There is also a possibility that the crisis in internal transport in India,aggravated by the recent floods, will imperil supplies from that area. In other areas supplies of high priority cargo should be fully adequate to implementleading programmes and certain additional supplies may. be available. But if the threatened shortfall of cargo in North America and in Indian Ocean areas is ona large scale it will materialise too late in the. year to enable sufficient tonnage to be diverted to other areas to maintain aggregate imports at the programmedlevel.Recommendations.13. In our Fifth Report we recommended that, until it became clear whatimports in the second half of 1943 were likely to amount to, the Ministry of war transport should endeavour to secure to the Ministry of Food an import for theyear of 10-5 million tons, leaving the balance of the import to the Ministry ofProduction. At the same time, we recommended that of, a total import of26 million tons, 11 million tons should be regarded as the appropriate share of theMinistry of Food. Since any shortfall in the availability of cargoes will affectmaterials rather than food, we now recommend that the Ministry of War Trans-port should endeavour to secure the full share of 11 million tons to the Ministryof Food. Such an undertaking would, of course, be contingent on the Ministry ofFood making available cargoes of type and provenance broadly in accordance withthe import programme.14. We also recommend that, in order to shed more light on the Indian&apos;position, a reliable estimation of the internal transportation position in India andof the effect of increased military activity on the availability of supplies at sea-board, should be made as a matter of urgency.The First Half of 1944.Import Requirements.15. Import requirements in the first half of 1944 are, of course, dependentupon the imports actually brought in during the remainder of this year. Theyhave recently been calculated by Departments on the assumption that the26 million ton programme for 1943 is fully implemented. The figures are givenin the following table : Million tons.EstimatedNetConsumption      Change in required of Imports Stocks. Imports.Food...       ......      5-28 - -14 5-1Materials    ......      6-34 -  -24 6 1Munitions, &amp;c.      ...      1-25 ... 1-3Total   ......     12-87 -   - -38 12-5(An analysis of these import requirements by commodities isgiven in Appendix A.)16. The net consumption estimates for the first half of 1944 are higher forall three Departmental programmes than actual net consumption of imports in thefirst half of this year. In the case of food, this is due to various factors, including an estimated increase in the requirements of United States troops. The increasednet consumption of materials is partly attributable to a decline in the anticipatedhome production of timber. The planned reduction in stocks of materials is clueto a number of small adjustments partly seasonal.Import Prospects.17. Until military demands on our tonnage in the first half of 1944 havecrystallised, it will be imposible to forecast with confidence what imports wemay expect in British controlled tonnage. Assuming, however, (a) that the partof that tonnage which is utilised for military purposes remains on the averageat about the same level during the first half of. 1944 as during the second halfof 1943, and (&amp;) that cargo will be available in the various loading areas as
programmed by the Supply Departments, we estimate that imports in. Britishcontrolled tonnage will be in - the neighbourhood of 8 million tons.; This is2 million tons less than was imported in British controlled tonnage in the first half of this year. In comparing these figures, however, it must be rememberedthat the shrinkage of the British controlled dry cargo fleet, due to the estimatedexcess of losses over new building, is expected to continue. Moreover, imports during the first half of 1943 were swollen by the temporary diversion of suppliesintended for Russia, referred to in paragraph 3, and, to a much more importantextent, by the severe curtailment of shipments to the Indian Ocean, which releasedtonnage for employment on the North Atlantic.18. The estimate for 1944 does not take account of any imports which maybe brought to the United Kingdom in the vessels to be bareboated to us by theUnited States. The reason for this is that the details of the arrangement are notyet sufficiently clarified to enable the effect on the total of British controlledtonnage available for importing service to be estimated.19. Our tentative conclusion is that we shall stand in need of directAmerican assistance to our import programme to the extent of some 4^ million tons of imports, subject to any deduction that may be necessary on account ofthe aforementioned bareboat vessels.20. There should be no difficulty, as far as can be judged at the presenttime, in securing and making available for shipment the raw-material require-ments referred to iii paragraph 15 above. The same is true of food requirementsunless and until policy decisions are taken involving the diversion of supplies to meet possible demands for liberated territories. With this proviso supplies should be available to meet the United Kingdom import programme of12^ million tons in the first half of 1944. But, from a broader standpoint, theproblem may become one of finding cargoes rather than ships. There may be considerably more shipping space available to the United Nations to carry importsfrom the various loading areas to destinations in different parts of the worldthan can easily be filled with the available supplies of civil and military cargo.21. Our Sub-Committee on the Availability of Cargoes is now conductinga preliminary investigation into the probable United Nations requirements for imported food and raw materials outside the Western Hemisphere, and into thesupplies likely to be available to meet these requirements. The Sub-Committeeexpects to be in a position to submit a report on this aspect of the problem inOctober.Signed on behalf of the Committee,HARCOURT JOHNSTONE, Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,24 A August, 1943.

Assumptions Underlying Estimates of Non-Tanker Imports into UnitedKingdom in 1943.The estimate of United Kingdom imports amounting to approximately 26million tons in 1943, quoted in paragraph 10 of the Report, is based on achievedimports of 11-6 million tons for the first half of the year, and an estimate of14-4 million tons of imports for the second half of the year, built on the following assumptions :  -(a) That the average amount of British-controlled non-tanker, ocean-going. tonnage available in the second half of 1943 (including certain &quot; free &quot;tonnage operating in British interest) will be 18-7 million dead-weight tons. In making this estimate, the loss rates agreed by the combined Chiefs of Staff as applicable to all United Nations tonnagehave been applied pro rata to British controlled tonnage. The figuresdo not include the United States vessels to be transferred to the british flag on bareboat charter at the rate of some 20 vessels a month. this transfer will have little or no effect on the United Kingdom importposition during the remainder of 1943.(b) That 2-55 million deadweight tons, or 13^ per cent, of the availabletonnage, will be undergoing or awaiting repair.(c) That 2-75 million deadweight tons will be permanently engaged abroad,or in United Kingdom coasting.id) That 3 million deadweight tons will be required for military purposes,including trooping, which will have a very small importing value.(e) That the tonnage employed on sailings from United Kingdom and united States to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean area on averagewill amount to about 1 - 95 million deadweight tons.(/) That the tonnage employed for various other military purposes, including&apos;&apos; Torch &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; Husky &apos;&apos; maintenance, supplies to Russia and Turkeyon average will amount to about 2 - 75 million deadweight tons.(g) That the geographical distribution of sources from which imports will bedrawn will be as shown in Appendix to S.C. (43) 87.(h) That direct United States assistance to the United Kingdom import programme will amount to 6 - 8 million tons of imports over the year, ofwhich 5-2 million tons relate to the second half year.Note. As alluded to in para. 10 of the Report, additional military and quasi-military demands just received will result in alterations, the extent of which can-not at present be assessed, in the tonnage allowances shown above, particularly at (/).
