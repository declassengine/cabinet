(43) 392.lO^A September, 1943.WAR CABINET.EMPLOYMENT OF ITALIAN PRISONERS OF WAR IN THEUNITED KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.IN accordance with the conclusions reached by the War Cabinet on the5th June, 1941 (WM. (41) 57th Conclusions, Minute 8), I have since that datebeen dealing, in consultation with the Ministers immediately concerned, withany points requiring ministerial decision which have arisen in connection withplans for employing Italian prisoners of war in this country.2. The present position is that 74,900 Italian prisoners are at present atwork in this country. Arrangements have already been made to bring a further11,000 before the end of 1943; and now the Inter-departmental Committee whichis responsible for co-ordinating demands for prisoner of war labour, and forallocating men between Departments, has put forward a request that the importa-tion of 36,000 more prisoners should be authorised as a first instalment of a1944 programme.3. Our whole policy in this matter clearly needs to be reviewed in the lightof the Italian surrender. If we are going to have to return all the italian prisoners of war to Italy we ought to cancel at once all arrangements for bringingany more in from North Africa. If, on the other hand, there is a prospect ofour being able to keep any prisoners whom we can usefully employ (either asprisoners or under some plan for retaining a proportion of them as volunteers for civilian work in this country), there is no reason why we should not continueto supplement our manpower resources by increasing the number of Italiansemployed in the United Kingdom.4. In a broadcast on the 29th July last to the Italian people, general eisenhower said that, provided all British and Allied prisoners now in their hands were restored safely to us and not taken away to Germany, the hundreds-of thousands of Italian prisoners captured, by us in Tunisia and Sicily would return to the countless Italian homes who longed for them. It may be, therefore,that, whilst being able to retain the Italian prisoners captured earlier in the war,we shall have to give up those who have been taken in the more recent campaigns.This would have certain disadvantages, as will be seen from the annexed couvof a telegram (Concrete 362) which I sent to the Prime Minister on the19th August.5. If we are to cancel the arrangements for bringing in any of the 11,000prisoners still due this year, we shall have to act at once; and a decision in regardto next year&apos;s programme cannot be indefinitely postponed owing to the &quot;factthat the selection of sites for camps and the work on their construction will haveto be put in hand in the near future if they are to be ready in time. I shallaccordingly be grateful for the advice of my colleagues as to the assumption inregard to the future of Italian prisoners as a whole on which consideration of thesematters should be based. ^   ^Privy Council Office,Great George Street, S.W. 1,10th September, 1943.[26063]
ANNEX.Most Secret Cypher Telegram, Concrete No. 362 of the 19th August, from theLord President, to the Prime Minister.You will remember that in a broadcast on the 29th July last to the Italianpeople General Eisenhower said that, provided all British and Allied prisonersnow in their hands were restored safely to us and not taken away to Germany,the hundreds of thousands of Italian prisoners captured by us in Tunisia andSicily would return to the countless Italian homes who longed for them. this formula was substituted by you for a much wider undertaking suggested byGeneral Eisenhower.Since the broadcast, a circumstantial report has been received to the effectthat 2.500 British prisoners of war have been moved from Italy to Germany. Itthus appears possible that the condition stipulated by General Eisenhower hasalready been broken, in which case his offer must presumably be regarded as having lapsed. I accordingly feel it my duty to bring to your notice certaindisadvantages which the formula broadcast by General Eisenhower would have for us if we ever had to implement it.At present, there are 77,000 prisoners of war employed in the UnitedKingdom. None of these were captured in Sicily, but 23.000 were captured in tunisia and 5,000 more expected to arrive this month also come from Tunisia.If, therefore, General Eisenhower&apos;s offer had to be implemented we should atonce.lose 28.000 prisoners engaged on agriculture, forestry, quarrying, &amp;c, inthe United Kingdom. And the ships to take them could, I am told, only beprovided at direct cost to other military movements.The Eisenhower formula would also greatly aggravate the problem of replacing these 28,000 and of bringing in any further Italian prisoners next year(the 1944 programme has not yet been submitted to me, but I understand that wemay want to bring in another 40 or 50,000). The reason for this is that, whereastransport can be provided without great difficulty to bring from North Africa theItalian prisoners captured in Tunisia or Sicily, Italian prisoners captured else-where. who are in the Middle East, India, South Africa and East Africa, canonly be transported with greater difficulty and at far greater cost to other programmes. I am advised that, at the most, we could hope to be able to bring15,000 Italian prisoners from these other parts during the rest of this year.I am told that prisoners captured in Tunisia have proved better workers thanthose captured earlier on. Apart from this we have to think of the discontentwhich will result among Italian prisoners captured in 1940 and 1941, if theyhave to remain at work for us here whilst their fellow-countrymen are allowed toreturn home after a far shorter period of captivity.If any new undertaking has to be given, it would be preferable for it to relateonly to the return of prisoners of war who are surplus to the labour requirementsof the United Nations, irrespective of when or where they were captured. I realise that so bald a formula may not be practicable. I have, however, laid theposition fully before you so that in any further discussions with the Presidentyou may have in mind the importance, from the point of view of our ma,n-power situation, of arriving at something which comes as near as possible to having that effect. &quot; &apos;
