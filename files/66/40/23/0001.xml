THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   A ugust 1943.SECRET. \/   CoPX No,W.P. (43) 373.\%th August, 1943.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER FOR INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I have considered, in consultation with the Minister of Labour and NationalService, the Minister of Production and the Supply Ministers, the points raised atthe meeting of the War Cabinet on the 16th August regarding the supply of labour for aircraft production and other vital supply programmes (W.M. (43) 115th Con-clusions, Minute 7). We are agreed in submitting the following recommendations to the War Cabinet: 1. The Minister of Labour is satisfied that, so long as he remains under an absolute obligation to ensure that the labour force working on aircraft production is increased by 115,000 during the period from the 1st April to the 31st December,1943, and that any deficit in the total man-power supply does not fall on theM.A.P. programme, he must give an absolute and overriding preference to thelabour demands of M.A.P. If, however, such an absolute preference is given toM.A.P. over the remaining months of 1943, there is a definite risk that other vitalproduction will be jeopardised and that the balance of the supply programmes as awhole will be disturbed. We are, therefore, agreed that it is necessary to arrange that the labour requirements of certain vital parts of the other programmes shall receive the same preference as those of aircraft production. To secure this we propose the immediate adoption of the following arrangements, which will involve some modification of the absolute obligation noAV resting on the Minister of Labour(see paragraph 7 below).2. Production which, though under the auspices of other Supply Depart-ments, is part of the aircraft programme will be given the same preference forpurposes of labour supply, as aircraft production itself. For the purpose of effecting the expansion of 115,000 in the labour force working for MA.P., those parts of the &quot; common service &quot; and other programmes which are needed for the fulfilment of the aircraft programme will be regarded, for purposes of labour supply, as forming part of the M.A.P. programme.This will apply to products such as ball bearings, tools, tyres, rubber andsteel tubes required for aircraft production.3. As regards other supply programmes, the Minister of Production willfrom time to time designate other urgent products or services which he is satisfiedare vital to our war production and should be given a priority equal to that of theaircraft programme.It is understood (a) that the products or services so designated will be few in number and relatively small in terms of labour required; and(b) that the Departments concerned will not thereby, and to that extent, be relieved of their obligation to release (in the case of the Ministry ofof Supply) the total numbers already approved by the War Cabinet;or to restrict (in the case of the Admiralty) their net demands for. labour to the figures already approved by the War Cabinet. in planning their programmes in accordance with the previous decisionof the War Cabinet, the Supply Departments allowed for the labour requirements of such new vital work as was then foreseen; but Depart-ments may have to seek the approval of the War Cabinet for[25953]
additional man-power for new projects of the highest operationalimportance which were not contemplated at the time of the War.....Cabinet&apos;s   decision,   e.g.,   the   extension   of   the   flexible   bridgeprogramme.4. Where a product or service has been designated by the Minister ofProduction under paragraph 3 above, the particular firms and, where necessary,the particular parts of the production of those firms to which special preferenceis to be accorded will be identified and arrangements made, through the normalmachinery of the Preferences Sub-Committee of the Labour Co-co-ordinating committee, to secure that this production receives, where necessary for purposesof labour supply, equal preference with aircraft production.5. &quot;The Minister of Production will report monthly to the War Cabinet theextent to which he has designated under paragraph 3 above products and services which are not directly related to aircraft production.6. It is understood that nothing in the foregoing paragraphs will limit the process of ensuring that the release of labour from Ministry of Supply work is dovetailed into expansions of the M.A.P. labour force so far as is possible without dislocation of labour. Labour transferred from Ministry of supply to M.A.P. work, whether in the same factory or by block transfers of work-people in the same district or by block transfers of orders, will be regarded as&quot;released by the Ministry of Supply and absorbed by the Ministry of aircraft production.&quot;7. These arrangements will not involve any change in the statisticaldistribution of our man-power supply, as settled by the War Cabinet on the22nd July, or in the objectives of man-power policy then defined. They will, however,necessitate some modification of the absolute obligation which was then laid onthe Minister of Labour to ensure that, whatever else happened, the labour force on aircraft production was increased by 115,000 by the end of 1943.We therefore recommend that the first sentence in paragraph (14) of theWar Cabinet Conclusions of the 22nd July should be modified so as to read : &quot;In the administrative arrangements made to give effect to this -distribution of man-power every endeavour should be made to avoid a situation in which, if the supply up to the end of 1943 proved insufficient tomeet all the requirements set out in (13) above, the deficit would fall on theMinistry of Aircraft Production.&quot;J. A.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.18*7* August, 1943.
