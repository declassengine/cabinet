THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 358.3rd August, 1943.Copy No.     o)  WAR CABINET.UNCENSORED LETTERS TO THE WEHRMACHT.Note by the Secretary.By direction of the Prime Minister, the following digest of a Postal and telegraph Censorship Report, containing extracts from uncensored letters tothe Wehrmacht, is circulated for the information of the War Cabinet and DefenceCommittee.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,3rd August, 1943.POSTAL AND TELEGRAPH CENSORSHIP.Uncensored Letters to the Wehrmacht.(1) The Report is circulated primarily for the information of the Depart-ments concerned.(2) If use is made of any of the contents of the Report, otherwise than for thepurpose of information, the source of information should not be disclosed.(3) Under no circumstances should verbatim copies or extracts of letters beused save after consultation with the Director of Postal and telegraph censorship.This supplement is compiled from letters written in Germany destined for members of the Wehrmacbt, which have fallen into British hands.The letters deal mostly with news of air raids and with reactions thereto.Though of great interest value and more informative than the mail usuallyreceived (these letters have not been censored by the Germans), there is too littlematerial to correlate in the usual report form. The extracts given speak for themselves.Chief Officer,Information and Records Branch.Air Raids.Hamm, 4.3.43.&quot; Well, last week I couldn&apos;t&apos;t write, but that&apos;s the fault of the Tommy. Ifthis continues you won&apos;t get much mail from me perhaps once every four weeks.He gives us no rest whatever -they come here day and night. A week ago to-day he attacked Hamm at 11 a.m. They pasted the station, Post Office, Union, and theWest, very thoroughly. 141 dead were buried yesterday. Two days ago we satin the shelter from 23 - 00 until 05 - 30. People here are practically crazy. If theseair attacks continue like this, I don&apos;t know what the end will be -the peoplesimply can&apos;t stand it. Essen was attacked as nothing has even been bombedbefore, fully 70 per cent, of the city is in ruins. But everyone is angry at what happened in Hamm.   They came over in a very tight formation and dropped[25868] . b
their bombs without the slightest interference, and left in the same- tightformation. There wasn&apos;t&apos;t a fighter in sight and no anti-aircraft fire of any sort.Had that attack been made on the mine shafts, everyone would have been killed.We stood in the garden and watched the whole attack. They flew directly over ustoward the R.R. station of Hamm. We simply couldn&apos;t&apos;t believe that they wereEnglish, as they flew in such a tight formation and so low. We didn&apos;t knowwho it was until we saw the bombs begin to drop. But the Tommy is returningpractically every day to-day we have already had two alarms, and it&apos;s only earlyafternoon. We&apos;re back again to the days of 1940, and are sleeping with ourclothes on. This summer is certainly going to bring us a lot of sorrow. I packedall your good things and our linens in the cellar. Heinz Strieker&apos;s father waskilled at the Post Office I read that in the paper. More than 150 bombs were dropped. Union has had to stop work for several months many were killedthere.&quot;   (Heessen, 11.3.43; 1.)Nuremberg, 8.3.43.&quot; During the air raid of the 8th/9th March the following factories were destroyed : Arno Schill, I. K. Rupprecht, Chr. Geyer, our furniture warehouse,Bemerag-Halle, Bachdic (1), the Food Association, and many others which tous are unimportant. It was a terrible attack and a night of horrors. TheCEsterlien Garage in Volkmannst burned down, leaving only the car-wash roomstanding, where, luckily enough, we had our car.....   The latest news is thatit is planned to consolidate various businesses. As soon as I have accurate dataand know how our firm is to fare, I shall wire you.&quot;   (Nuremberg, 25.4.43; 2.)&quot; This is 11-30 p.m. and I just got up, and it&apos;s impossible to sleep when youalways have to be ready for another of those attacks. We feel the horror of warourselves now, though Goebbels thinks it a war of nerves. I met a womanyesterday who visited her mother in dusseldorf. Those people have had 800alarms, and things that have been rebuilt 2 and 3 times are always destroyed again.Here 200 were buried the other day, not counting military and other losses.Damage is great. Near the roundhouse a munitions train exploded. You arenot allowed to phone or wire. Several heavy A.A. positions were also destroyed;in those crews were 16-year-old high school boys and Russians who helped handup the ammunition .... Lotte gave me some milk, a rarity.&quot; (Nuremberg,14.3.43; Military Report No. 11.)Munich, 9.3.43.&quot;You undoubtedly have heard of the air raid onMunchen on 9th/ 10th March.After that attack munchen was burning in every corner.&quot;   (Munich, 21.4.43; 3.)&quot; They are working feverishly in Munchen to clear away the debris and bring back some semblance of order, after the attack of the 9th March. In the back,under the ruins of Stiehler&apos;s house, it&apos;s still smoking. Perhaps his stove is stillon.&quot;   (Munich, 26.3.43; 4.)Berlin, 27.3.43.&quot; One night (the 27th March) we had another visit from Tommy. Of course,I had to.be away from home at Weichert&apos;s. Lotte&apos;s sister-in-law from Berlin was there too. She was terribly worried, because, while we didn&apos;t notice much of anything here, they were evidently travelling toward Berlin. This time they hitthe Lichterfeld South station and made a direct hit on a leave train. It musthave been terrible. Papa was on night duty, and was up to his ears in workbecause all trains had to be switched on to other tracks, and up until this after-noon no train has gone through. They speak of 80 dead on the leave train it came from Berlin.&quot;   (Jueterbog, 9.4.43; 5.)Essen, 3.4.43 and 11.4.43.&quot; If we only had more rest at night. The enemy planes are visiting us veryoften. On the 3rd April we had our third large-scale attack on Essen. Wehad luck only to have our windows blown in and the ceiling collapse in a coupleof rooms nothing else was broken. You would never recognise the. city of Essen.Two-thirds of it is nothing but a pile of ruins. You just cannot imagine whatthat looks like here. Men on furlough from the Russian front say that it couldn&apos;t&apos;tlook any worse at the front. If we can only remain together in health and alive.We spent two nights in the shelter, but you can hardly stand that, with all those people.    On the average there are four to five thousand people in the shelter
nightly, and when the alarm goes off you can hardly get in, since it&apos;s filled tooverflowing already.&quot;   (Essen, 16.4.43; 6.)&apos;&apos; We are always afrai d of week-ends because then the Tommy really comesover. To-day is Saturday, and we&apos;ve had two alarms already, and about11 to-night he&apos;11 start with real power. No use going to bed before then, because he&apos;s usually here about an hour and does what he wants to do. Yesterday Goebbelsand several high-ranking men were in Essen and looked at everything. LaterG. gave a talk to party members, and naturally Tommy interrupted theproceedings that could have been told in advance. Eventually, though, youcome to a point where you don&apos;t care about anything, and when I think of yousoldiers at the front, then things are not so. difficult for me. There is no useleaving here. If we get hit, that&apos;s our fate, and if I stay alive I want to savewhatever can be saved. I wanted to take your things to Remschied, but no one is allowed to use the street car except defence workers with the necessary papersto prove it. I put everything in the cellar and will not have to feel that I didn&apos;tdo my duty. Otto, dear, I read in the paper (the radio doesn&apos;t work any more)about the great battle in Tunisia and with this and that our nerves are gettingvery raw. If only this war would end, we do need so much rest. Let&apos;s leaveeverything in God&apos;s hands and hope that he will put everything right in theend.&quot;   (Essen-Frintrop, 12.4.43; 7.)D.uisburg, 9.4.43-&quot; Am very ill, and my hands have become much worse. I had a nervousbreakdown a few nights ago during an air raid. Oh God, it was terrible, bombfollowed bomb, crashing into a cauldron of wildly burning flames, Mixe(l with it all was the horrible sound the trapped families who were then found dead thenext day 5, 6, 7, 8, in so many houses. I am glad that Anneliese is away.Markator Palace, Eisenrusstein, the whole Koehnigreder Sonnenwall, FriedrichWilhelm PL, all are nothing but piles of debris. Demag is also completely destroyed, a hit, by an aerial mine did the work. Terrific damage in the wholeneighbourhood, the Hochfelder Station is also gone. . . . -Now Heini is. being sentwith 12,000 others to the Russian front, to add to my worries. Hans is moving .from his position in Czechoslovakia, also to Russia. Let me wish you a happyEaster, no one feels like writing that, but it&apos;s a custom. Be brave, son, some day we shall have the blessings of peace again!&quot; (Duisburg-Hochfeld, 28.4.43;Military Report No. 11.)Stuttgart, 15.4.43.&quot; Last night we had another large-scale attack it can&apos;t be any worse thanthat at the front. This time they dropped more bombs on the eastern part of thecity. They hit a small gas storage tank. Down beyond the Neckartor many houses are supposed to have been destroyed. They also attacked heavily in Munster.Here they dropped a high explosive bomb near Hilda. There are mountains ofglass in the streets. I wonder how much longer this can go on-pretty soon therewon&apos;t be anything left of Stuttgart.&quot;   (Stuttgart, 16.4.43; 8.). &apos;&apos; Did you get my last letter, the one which I wrote during the last air raid ?Since then, day before yesterday, everything is topsy-turvy at the Post Office.Tommy went on a rampage over Stuttgart again, principally over Cannstatt.There has been no gas in Stuttgart since then, that Cannstatt station doesn&apos;texist any more, and there are no trains running, either. We get-almost no mailfrom the outside, and it doesn&apos;t even pay to go to the post office to find out, either.I hope that train traffic will be resumed by Sunday.&quot;   (Goeppingen, 16.4.43; 9.)Riegelsberg I Saar, 18.4.43.&quot; Last night we had another raid, which lasted four hours. Only five were killed, as most of the people were in the shelter on the mountain and nothinghappened there. This goes on every night, and we are all getting tired and arelosing our resistance.&quot;   (Riegelsberg/Saar, 19.4.43; 10.)Stettin, 20.4.43.&quot; It&apos;s not always thus, that the soldier out at the front is the only one to -have to sacrifice his life. At home there are so many lives lost through terrorattacks of the British. A murderous hand swept over Stettin and demanded hisprice. During the night of the 20th April, the Fuhrer&apos;s birthday, the sirenshowled about 00-45. The next hour was the most horrible of my life-it beggarsdescription. Stettin had to undergo an attack such as no city ever had to feel.It was horrible. Half of the city is destroyed, many people are homeless. In[25868] b 2
our circle of relatives I&apos;m the only one undamaged. People who happened to bein Stettin from Berlin, Hamburg and the Rhineland said they had never seensuch destruction heaped upon any city. In Oberwink, Pommerensdorf, Applest,people were buried in the debris of their collapsed houses. There were manykilled. Those streets are completely destroyed. There is neither water nor gas.The first thing that was done was to destroy the water tower on Kohakenberg (?),which left the city without water. It burned for many days everywhere. Manystreets are barred because of the danger of houses collapsing. I haven&apos;t gone out to take a look yet. On my way to work I only see damage. Ewald&apos;s stoveexploded, but his apartment is still partly O.K. An incendiary fell into Erni&apos;skitchen, but was seen and put out at once. Windows all gone, of course, and thewhole place made filthy. At mother&apos;s all windows are gone, of course, and the.door from the apartment to the store is also off its hinges; the whole place istopsy-turvy. The damage in loss of glass is tremendous. The roof burned offyour parents&apos; home. In Pasewalkerst all the windows of every house are gone,and the roofs burned off so that the sky shows throughout the houses.&quot; (Stettin,29.4.43; 11.)&apos;&apos; On the night of the 20th we had a terrific attack. To date, there are 35,000homeless, and more than 1,000 dead. On top of that there are still so many buriedin* the ruins, since whole streets were levelled at once. It looks horrible, and you can&apos;t possibly imagine the ferocity of such an attack. We got additional rationcards and are helping to clean up the debris. For several days there was neithergas nor water, and they served peeled potatoes (boiled potatoes) from fieldkitchens. I stayed at Lindermann&apos;s and three people were killed there, also.4,000-lb. aerial mines were dropped, and we are still stunned from the effects.Now we have to work on Sunday and 1st May, and we also had to work over Easter,that is almost too much. The whole organisation is somewhat rotten, otherwise there wouldn&apos;t &apos;t have been nearly so much damage. There was no protection for people who rented apartments, but if a fire started at the home of a party member,right away they had twenty persons there to help fight it, including the firedepartment that certainly made the rest of us mad.&quot;   (Stettin, 28.4.43; 12.)The Tunisian Campaign.A mother writes to her son : &apos;&apos; The paper says that the enemy is very strong and in many cases superior. May God see to it that you get out of that witches&apos;cauldron safely. How happy I would be if you were slightly wounded and wouldhave to be evacuated from Tunisia, before you are surrounded by the enemy. Iam praying that you will be returned to me, happily, some day as an AfricaFighter. I hope that your food will continue good so that it won&apos;t happen-to youas it did to the men before Stalingrad, that you might have to suffer the pangs ofhunger in addition to your other hardships.&quot; (Hattingen, Ruhr, 14.4.43;Military Censorship Report No. 8.)&quot; Oh, you poor, poor fellows. If you could only all return here to us for good !But before that God knows how much misfortune may befall both you and us. Ican only tell you that these times make one despair and the morale (Stimmung)here at home as well as oh the eastern front is not exactly the best. You probablyknow all about that.&quot; (Hesdorf bei Gemuenden, 26.4.43; Military CensorshipReport No. 8.) .&quot;Yesterday as well as to-day the mail which I sent you was returned.Surely they could have a better system to make sure that.the men at the frontget news from home. Some are making all the sacrifices- and many others havedone nothing during the past four years of the war, so it will always be. But,there is no use talking, one has to keep one&apos;s mouth shut. However, when thishorrible war will have taken all my sacrifices and destroyed my life, then will it longer make any difference and I will give vent to my rage.&quot; (4.3.43; MilitaryCensorship Report No. 8.)&quot;I am greatly worried over you. Things are not running well in Tunis;I believe that it will be a repetition of Stalingrad. I can honestly say that I&apos;velost all hope. .... Day and night we have air-raid alarms. All the children are sick and I have lost weight again.&quot; (Pirmassens, 14.4.43; Military Censor-ship Report No. 8.)Soldiers advised to surrender.Try to hold out, dear son; this year, too, will come to an end some day. when you can&apos;t do anything else, then pexrnit,yourself..:to..be..captured, because the mainthing is to remain alive.....-And there must be an end to this, because things
529just can&apos;t continue this way if the air raids are permitted to go on like this.(Munich, 20.4.43; Military Report No. 11.)I believe that our cause in Africa is a lost one; and when it comes down tothat, do as Uki did; then you will come back healthy; it doesn&apos;t matter when.Planes are over Germany nightly. In Berlin many lives were lost, Essen hasbeen levelled, Rotterdam, in Antwerp, 2,000 killed, Paris was heavily bombedon the 4th. Things are not so rosy any more and I think the end is near. Thepeople are all mentally depressed and despondent; one was saying that the warwill last another four or five years, which I do not believe. (Viernheim, 10.4.43;Military Report No. 11.)&quot; During the last few days I simply can&apos;t get hold of myself, I&apos;m really close to despair.   We know what is in store for you over there!   You know, mydarling, I would, in a way, be content to see you captured--at least there wouldbethe possibility that I will see you after the war is over.   Of course, &apos; capture &apos;is easily said, but it also means such a long parting.. ....   Were we really bornto lead such a horrible life?   This is driving me crazy.   Here at home they saythat Tunisia is going to be another Stalingrad, and then they tell us not to loseheart! . . . .    To-day Otto Krebs, who lives in our neighbourhood, got his orders *he&apos;s a farmer. God, now that they are even drafting farmers it looksvery black for us -I think that I can say aloud.&quot; (Hermesdorf, Sachsen, 12.4.43;Military Censorship Report No. 9.)&quot; The war may come to an end over night; it cannot last for ever. In 1918it also came to a sudden end. .... At the same time, I want to ask you to bevery careful and consider what happened to uncle. Not all people can be as badas the Russians .... Do you understand me? .... It&apos;s midnight just.now,and they are saying that Hitler and Mussolini are having another conference aboutthe conduct of the war, at the Brenner Pass. Sounds like an ominous warning,but we will hope for the best.&quot; (Stalpen am Graben, 11.4.43; Military CensorshipReport No. 9.)Home Morale.Several letters show evidence of deep depression, even defeatism : &quot; I thinkthat the end is near. We cannot stand it much longer. We have reached a point where a representative of the farm organisation travels around and selects cattlewhich without further ado are taken away. To-day they were here, but Imanaged to get out of it. Next time they come I have to give them either the oxor the cow.&quot;   (Stolpen, Sachsen, 13.4.43; Military Censorship Report No. 9.)&apos;&apos; Our fear is very great; there is no rest at daytime or night. We hope that italy will not give up. We are also beginning to question &apos; must the war last solong? &apos; We are thankful that everything as yet has not been destroyed. Thepeople, however, must not lose courage and must endure the attacks.&quot; (Plauen,11.4.43; Military Censorship Report No. 9.)Criticism of Government.&quot; At the end of this year, perhaps already, they want to take my brotherwho is hardly 17 out to the front. They won&apos;t let those children into the movies,but judging by appearances they are good enough for the front. Our parents arebeside themselves. And that is what they call &apos; higher powers,&apos; and there is&apos;nothing we can change. Everything looks so hopeless!&quot; (Berlin, 18.1.43;Military Report No. IT.)&quot;As is Aunt Frieda I am not for the government, either, and Til take gasbefore I accept their winter help. There are some sane people left, but also manyrotters.&quot;   (Berlin, 28.4.43; Military Report No. 11.)
