I circulate the attached telegrams and prints of the various instruments of Surrender which we have prepared in case of an approach being made to us by Italy.2. I may say that I deprecate the undue use by us of the expression &quot; united nations.&quot; It is necessary sometimes, but in this case it is not right to speak of the United Nations as only Britain and the United States are conducting theaffair and are being consulted. Canada (which has troops engaged) and Russiaare being kept specially informed. We could not tolerate the inclusion of all theUnited Nations in these discussions, which are difficult enough even whenconfined to the two English-speaking countries.3. The United States have usually liked the expression &quot; United Nations,&quot;but we must be careful that Great Britain does not get entirely shut out and that everything that is published does not become either &quot; United States&quot;&quot;and general eisenhower&apos;or &quot; United Nations.&quot; It must not be forgotten that we are the major,contributors in numbers, - blood, force, ships and aircraft-in-action to this jointenterprise. In this case I understand the United States themselves, and certainlyCanada, have questioned the lavish use of the expression &quot; United Nations.&quot; TheDepartments should revise the document from this point of view and see that the term is only used sparingly.w. s. c.10 Botoning Street, S.W. 1,3rd August, 1943.[25856a]
