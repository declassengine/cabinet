THIS. DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET. y    Copy No.W.P. (43) 363.11th August, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON BLACKOUT RESTRICTIONS in industrial ESTABLISHMENTS.THE War Cabinet, at their meeting on the 9th July (W.M. (43)96th Conclusions, Minute 2), appointed a Committee to consider and report what modifications could be made, in the light of present circumstances, in the lighting restrictions affecting industrial establishments, with a view to increasing war production.   The membership of the Committee was the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (Chairman),the Secretary of State for Air,the Minister of Supply,the Minister of Aircraft Production, andthe Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade,assisted as might be necessary by representatives of the Admiralty, the Ministryof Labour and National Service and other Departments concerned.The Committee&apos;s recommendations are summarised below.2. Substitution of removable for permanent blackout.The Committee considered that, although the general and immediate substi-tution of removable for permanent blackout in industrial establishments wasruled out by the cost and by the scale on which labour and materials would be needed, steps should be taken to substitute removable for permanent blackoutwherever practicable. The Ministry of Production had already assumed responsi-bility for inter-departmental arrangements to facilitate this work at individualfactories, but little progress had been made under these arrangements, and theCommittee thought that they ought to be speeded up.Among the considerations put to the Committee were the following : (a) Even if the provision of removable blackout could only be effected in thenext few months at the cost, to some extent, of production and ofsupplies of material for other purposes, it was nevertheless arguable that this immediate cost would be more than counterbalanced by anincrease in production later.(b) There was a good deal of feeling among work people against permanentblackout. If a start could be made on the work, it would show that something was being done, even if the work could not be completedquickly.(c) Any such step would be likely to help fuel economy.The three Supply Departments put forward for consideration a number ofcases where the managements themselves had raised the question of providingremovable blackout. The Ministry of Supply&apos;s proposals covered twenty-fivefactories (six R.O.Fs. and nineteen commercial factories on the Ministry&apos;s vitallist); the Ministry of Aircraft Production^ proposals covered twenty-fourfactories; and the Admiralty&apos;s proposals covered ten factories. These lists wereby no means exhaustive; and, if it becomes known that the policy of providingremovable blackout is being encouraged and&apos; accelerated, more applications maybe expected. The Committee thought, however, that the matter would have to bedealt with piecemeal, and that the proper course was to dispose of this first batchof cases and then to deal with others as quickly as the supply and man-power position allowed.[25904]
If the limited programme advanced by the Supply Departments is approved,questions of labour, materials and finance arise.Labour. The total demand of labour for these schemes is not large. In viewof the man-power situation, it will be necessary to examine in each case howlabour can best be provided, but in some cases it should be possible to provide, inaddition to the maintenance staffs, assistance from the production staff and,where available, outside assistance. The Ministry of Labour and NationalService are prepared, in cases of special difficulty, to consider an allocation oflabour, but clearly the Supply Departments must make ever)&apos;- effort to carry thework out by their own maintenance staffs.Materials. The Committee were informed that the Ministry of Works didnot anticipate serious difficulty about supplying materials on the scale contem-plated by these schemes.Finance. It was suggested that finance might cause difficulty; the firmsthemselves have to pay for the provision of removable blackout. The committee consider that if finance does prove to be a serious obstacle, it should not be allowedto stand in the way, and consideration should be given to including the provisionof removable blackout under the Ministry of Supply Act.The Committee accordingly recommend that the schemes for the substitution of removable for permanent blackout in the factories proposed by the supply departments should be approved, and that further schemes should be included assoon as material and man-power allow. It is recommended that the Ministry ofProduction should continue to be generally responsible for the administration ofthe arrangements within which these schemes would fall.3. Possibility of dispensing with permanent blackout.The Committee decided that it was out of the question to relax altogetherthe present restrictions so as to permit factories to work with their lights on afterdark; the German Air Force would undoubtedly bomb factories lit up after dark,and one or two incidents of this kind would have serious repercussions.The Committee considered whether permanent blackout might be dispensed with in particular factories or particular areas, on the understanding thatreasonable notice could be given of enemy attack. On this basis, a few specificfactories were suggested; but if adequate warning were to be given of the approach of enemy aircraft, the warning area would have to be so much extendedthat the number of warnings given would increase very substantially, with a consequent loss in production. Further, the increase in the numbers of opera-tional and training aircraft has added to the difficulties of picking out all enemyraiders in adequate time.The general view of the Committee was that the additional production whichwould be gained by the removal of blackout in the few factories suggested wouldbe very small in amount, and would be more than counter-balanced by theincreased number of stoppages for air raid warnings, by the probable adverse effect on the morale of workers and their families, and by the risks of attack bythe enemy.The Committee accordingly recommend that the proposal, to dispensealtogether with blackout in selected factories should not be pursued.4. Exempted lighting.This lighting, except for certain lights in a low category, is under controland can be switched out immediately on receipt of a warning. A number of detailed proposals for improving the standard of lighting permitted have beenmade. Certain of these proposals will involve detailed enquiries which can properly be left to the ordinary departmental machinery. The conclusions reached by the Committee on the main questions are as follows : Railways marshalling yards.-Th.e use of -7 f.c. lighting in marshalling yards is at present restricted to small yards in isolated areas. To facilitate move-men t of traffic during the winter the committee consider that a wider use of this increased standard of lighting could properly be allowed in marshalling yards inthe less vulnerable areas, and they recommend that the use of -7 f.c. lightingshould be allowed in marshalling yards west and north of the line St. David&apos;sHead - Gloucester - Bristol (exclusive) - London (exclusive) - Bletchley - Goole -Falkirk - Dingwall. Proposals to instal the higher standard in yards in theneighbourhood of vital establishments and in large yards in built-up areas wouldbe examined individually.    In London, specific cases of difficulty would be
considered where requests were made for the addition of a few points of higherlighting.Motive power depots carriage depots goods yards and workshops. It is recommended that for work in open-ended sheds, &amp;c, lighting up to the -7 f.e..standard should be permitted provided that the lamps are screened so that nolight is thrown above the horizontal and the spillage on the ground outside theshed does not exceed - 2 f .c. Individual cases where it is claimed that an increaseof intensity would be an advantage for external work will be examined ontheir merits.Passenger stations. The Committee recommend that railway companies should be instructed to make fuller use of the improved standards already agreed.The possibility of extending the use of -2 f.c. lighting already approved for thelarger stations will be examined in individual cases.Colour light signals. The Committee consider that the London passenger transport Board should be authorised to leave these signals undimmed for thefirst and last half hours of the blackout period.External lighting at gas manufacturing plants, &amp;c. The Ministry of fuel and Power suggested that the yards of gas and electrical supply undertakings and coke ovens where coal handling, &amp;c, goes on, should be lighted up to thestandard permitted, for railway marshalling yards. The Committee thought thatthe best course would be for the Ministry of Home Security and the Ministry of fuel and Power jointly to arrange a suitable scheme.Improvement of working conditions in glare-producing plants and boilerhouses. In general, glare presents a more serious problem than ordinary lighting;the intensity of industrial glare in most instances is of such high intensity as tobe visible at distances far beyond the warning area. Large sums are being spent in alleviating conditions at various establishments, for instance by providingimproved ventilation.The Committee recommend that individual cases where the Ministry of fuel and Power or the Supply Departments consider that conditions are bad should be examined jointly by the Technical Officers of the Department concerned and the ministries of Home Security and Labour so that the necessary structural measuresappropriate to the particular type of building can be put in hand to improveworking conditions.Collieries. In the less vulnerable areas, an alleviation of blackoutrestrictions, particularly in railway sidings and pithead plants, would assisthandling transport and processing at the surface, and the Committee recommendthat surface lighting requirements in collieries should be re-examined by theMinistry of Fuel and Power and the Ministry of Home Security.5. Shortening the blackout.During the early stages of the war the blackout extended from sunset tosun-rise, but it was subsequently reduced to the period half an hour after sunsetand half an hour before sun-rise, and later still further reduced by fifteenminutes at each end of the day for the mid-summer months.The Committee considered whether a further reduction would be warranted,having regard to the tactical experience of the last twelve months, but they decided that the risks involved would outweigh the advantages secured.They considered, however, that it would be desirable to examine on their merits individual cases where a limited amount of external lighting for use atthe beginning and end of blackout hours would be of value to industry forexample, firms who require outside lighting and whose shifts, especially in winter,overlap the blackout hours by short periods.Further, the Ministry of Home Security and the Air Ministry should keepthe general question under review, in the light of tactical experience.6. Conclusions.The Committee do not consider that it would be practicable, in existingcircumstances, to introduce any general measures such as the shortening of theblackout, the removal of blackout in industrial establishments, or the widespread and immediate substitution of removable for permanent blackout in industrial establishments.They consider, however, that a number of steps can be taken which will,cumulatively, assist considerably towards an increase in production. they recommend that the schemes put forward by the Supply Departments for the
substitution of removable for permanent blackout in certain factories shouldbe approved and the work put in hand as soon as possible; that other similarapplications should be dealt with as quickly as the supply of labour and materialspermit; and that the various detailed proposals summarised in paragraph above for raising the standard of exempted lighting in particular cases shouldbe pursued with the minimum of delay.(Signed on behalf of the Committee),HERBERT MORRISON, Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,11th August, 1943.
