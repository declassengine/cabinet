E.Foreign Office, 4th September, 1943.ANNEX I.Text of Four-Power Declaration.The Governments of the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and china, united in their determination, in accordance with the Declaration by theUnited Nations of the 1st January, 1942, and subsequent Declarations, tocontinue hostilities against those Axis Powers with which they respectively areat war until such Powers have laid down their arms on the basis of unconditional surrender, conscious of their responsibilities to secure the liberation of themselves and the people allied with them from the menace of aggression; recognising thenecessity of ensuring a rapid and orderly transition from war to peace and ofestablishing and maintaining international peace and security with the leastdiversion of the world&apos;s human and economic resources for armaments, jointlydeclare 1. That their united action, pledged for the prosecution of the war, willbe continued for the organisation and maintenance of peace and security.2. That those of them at war with a common enemy will act together in all matters relating to. the surrender and disarmament of that enemy, and to anyoccupation of enemy territory and of territory of other States held by that enemy.3. That they will take all measures deemed by them to be necessary to provide against any violation of the requirements imposed upon their present enemies.4. That they recognise the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicabledate a general international organisation, based on the principle of the sovereignequality of all nations, and to open to membership by all nations, large and small,,for the maintenance of international peace and security.5.

6. That, in connection with the foregoing purpose, they will establish a technical commission to advise them on the military problems involved, includingthe composition and strength of the forces available in an emergency arisingfrom a threat to the peace.7. That they will not employ their military forces within the territories ofother States except for the purposes envisaged in this Declaration and after joint consultation and agreement.8. That they will confer and co-operate to bring about a practicable generalagreement with respect to the regulation of armaments in the post-war period.ANNEX II.(Concrete No.7 tf.)Following for Prime Minister from Foreign Secretary : I have been giving further thought to the question of the Four-power declaration, in the light of the preliminary observations of the Foreign Officerecorded in Concrete telegrams Nos. 477 (Annex III) and 525 (Annex IV).Following are my ideas on the subject. If you approve, I will put them to theCabinet on Monday, and after that, if Cabinet agree, to the Americans.&apos;2. - With regard to the document itself, I would not wish to insist on the objection to Article 5 recorded in paragraph 2 (c) of Concrete No. 525 if theUnited States Government attaches importance to the words which we proposed should be omitted. Nor would I now want to dwell on the fact, alluded to inparagraph 2 (d) of Concrete No. 525, that China may, under the American draft,to some extent be &quot; brought into &quot; Europe. Finally, I prefer the Americanwording of Article 7.3. On relatively minor points I suggest that paragraphs 3 and 4 might readbetter as follows : &apos;&quot;&apos; 3. That they will take all measures deemed by them to be necessary toprovide against any violation of the terms imposed upon the enemy.&apos;&apos; 4. That they recognise the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organisation, for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of nations.&quot;4.   Otherwise, I feel the text is excellent.5. With regard to procedure, it seems to me that the best thing would be forthe Americans to suggest that subject should be included on agenda for forth-coming meetings of Foreign Secretaries, and to circulate draft to Russians and ourselves in advance. If we all three agreed at the meeting on the final draft weshould no doubt have to approach the Chinese. But the method of handling thelatter is a matter which Cadogan could no doubt discuss with Hull or state department.ANNEX III.(Concrete No. 477.) 22nd August, 1943.Following for Foreign Secretary from Law : Washington telegrams Nos. 3690, 3691, 3692 and 3712.American idea of Four-Power Declaration offers advantage from our pointof view, although present proposal appears less valuable than Mr. Welles&apos;original Conception of protocol, whole point of which (as he outlined it) was thatit would be something that Senate would have to ratify now, whereas (paragraph of Washington telegram No. 3690) present declaration is specifically stated to be drafted in form which would not require Senate&apos;s approval.
I &apos;i 2. I hope, however, that Americans do not deceive themselves into thinking that such a declaration as they apparently contemplate would satisfy Stalin, unlessforthcoming tripartite discussions cover matters of real interest to him, such as (a) Soviet Western frontiers;(b) The problem of Germany; and; (c) Problems connected with treatment of countries which may be evacuatedby German forces or reconquered from them, which will bring up thequestions of the Balkans and Eastern and South-Eastern Europegenerally.3. Moreover, both in his message of 10th August to Prime Minister and inhis more recent message to President, Stalin makes it clear that he is thinking interms of concluding definite agreements on a number of subjects to be agreedbeforehand. You will also remember that, wdien Sir A. Clark Kerr broachedquestion of Germany, &amp;c, w^ith Stalin and Molotov on his return from leave lastFebruary, they took the line that they would be little interested in generalexploratory exchanges of views and would like a meeting of plenipotentiaries toreach definite agreements. There have been other indications that this is ratheran idee fuxe with them.4. There would obviously be considerable advantage in taking the initiative in suggesting an agenda before Russians do so, and making it clear to them at the outset that, much as we should like cut-and-dried agreements (see paragraph 3),the most we and the Americans could hope to do in the case of a number of questions would be to have exploratory exchanges of views, since our own mindsare not made up.5. It is also probable that on most of the topics discussed conclusions reachedcould not be published at present stage. This inclines us to the view that american Four-Power Declaration should not precede discussions with Russians,but result from them. It would meet the need for important public statementresulting from discussions, while little would probably be left to say if it hadpreceded the conference. Moreover, if Four-Power Declaration were issued first,it might give the Russians the opportunity of contending, in the course ofdiscussion, that we and the Americans were not living up to it if we foundourselves unable to agree at every point with the Russians.6. We realise that President may be attracted by the idea of issuingDeclaration as soon as possible in order to meet present American public anxietyin regard to Russia. But would it not be enough for this purpose to make agreedannouncement that Three-Power Conference with Russia was about to be held ?ANNEX IV.(Concrete No. 525.) 23rd August, 1943.   -\Following for Foreign Secretary from Sargent: Your telegrams Nos. 313 and 314, Welfare, crossed our telegram ConcreteNo. 477.2.   Following are our comments on text in Welfare No. 314 : (a) In  the  preamble   &apos;&apos; United  Kingdom &apos;&apos;   should  be  substituted  for&apos;.&apos; Great Britain.&quot;(b) In Article 2 it would offend the minor Allies and the French if we wereto speak of &apos;&apos; occupation of enemy territory and of territory of other states held by that enemy.&quot; We suggest reading: &quot;occupation of enemy territory and to the liberation of territory of other States heldby that enemy.&quot;(c) Objection to Article 5 as it now stands is that the four Powers concerned have no mandate to consult or act &quot; on behalf of the community ofnations.&quot; We suggest therefore that these seven words should be omitted.
(d) It will not have escaped you that as China is at war with Germany andItaly the provisions of the Declaration (e.g., Article 2) bring in theChinese in respect of Europe.(e) Is there not a danger that Soviet Government will read Article 7 as.directed against themselves ?3. In the event of there being a Declaration, its importance would be such that it would be essential that Dominion Prime Ministers should be given anopportunity of expressing their views on it before we are committed. In that case, we would propose to communicate with them as soon as we learn result of prime Ministers discussion with the President. We assume that in themeantime there would be no question of any public announcement.
