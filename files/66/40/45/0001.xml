WAR CABINET

POSITION OF ITALIAN PRISONERS OF WAR AFTER ARMISTICE

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.

1. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on 13th September (W.M.(43) 127th Conclusions, item 4) I mentioned that, as a result of the Armistice with Italy, Italian prisoners of war in this country were asking camp commandants about their future, and I suggested that, unless a suitable answer was given, there was a risk that they might become discontented and that their work would be affected. The War Cabinet agreed that this matter should be considered later in the week, in conjunction with a Memorandum circulated by the Lord President of the Council (W.P.(43) 392).

2. I understand that it has since been suggested that it would be helpful to the War Cabinet if I were to circulate the text of an aide memoire for the guidance of commandants in charge of Italian prisoners of war camps in this country, which has been drawn up at official level in the Foreign Office and the War Office, and which I road to the War Cabinet at yesterday&apos;s meeting.

The proposed text is reproduced below:-

"The cessation of hostilities with Italy as a result of

"the signing of the Armistice does not of itself make any difference

"under International Law to the status of Italians held in this

"country. They remain prisoners of war. We shall continue

"to treat them with respect and all consideration.

"Discipline must however be maintained and orders obeyed. All 

"Italians must realise that their country is short of food and other

"necessities, in obtaining which she must look to the United Nations

"for assistance. They are urged to work hard in this country because

"by so doing they will be helping their families in Italy".
