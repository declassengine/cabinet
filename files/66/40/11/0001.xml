THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET. I Copy No. 3 3W.P. (43) 361.Qth August, 1943.WAR CABINET.INDIA.PROPOSED DIRECTIVE TO THE VICEROY EMPOWERING HIM TOCO-ORDINATE ON BEHALF OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTHE ACTIVITIES OF POLITICAL WARFARE ORGANISA-TIONS OPERATING FROM INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE development of India as a base for military operations which, togetherwith their ancillary services, require local co-ordination on a United-Nations-widebasis, has produced, amongst other results, the establishment in India of project-tions of certain Whitehall Departments mainly, if not exclusively, those createdto meet war requirements Ministry of Supply, Ministry of War Transport,Ministry of Information and Political Warfare Executive. Some of theseprojections are little more than liaison agencies, others have a very completeexecutive function. All depend for the successful discharge of their duties onthe aid and co-operation of Indian organisations, whether governmental or non-governmental; but over none at present does the Governor-General personally orthe Governor-General in Council have any legal authority enabling him to securethat they co-ordinate their activities with the appropriate Departments of theGovernment of India or Provincial Governments. A situation of some anomalyis thus created which is capable of producing a crop of difficulties, for the avoidance of which in somewhat comparable circumstances the appointments of minister of State, Middle East, and Resident Minister in West Africa werecreated.2. My colleagues are aware that in connection with the arrangementsprojected for setting up a South-East Asia Command it is contemplated that theViceroy should in an extra-statutory capacity be given authority to superviseon behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government and to co-ordinate the activities of thevarious agencies in India of Whitehall Departments concerned with supply andother matters ancillary to the new Command. The proposals in question are under active discussion between the Service Departments but can hardly be put intoeffect for some time yet. In the meantime the immediate question of the localcontrol of the Far Eastern Bureau, which is the agency in India of the Ministryof Information and the Political Warfare Executive, needs solution. In relationparticularly to the Political Warfare side of its activities (which will be of concern to the South-East Asia Command when set up, but. are in operationnow), the Far Eastern Bureau of the Ministry of Information depends upon thefacilities that can be made available by the All-India Radio, which is the propertyof the Government of India, with whom lies, by statute, control of all broad-casting conducted in India.3. For the due co-ordination of the functions of the Far Eastern Bureau itseems, therefore and the Ministry of Information and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, who is also concerned, agree very desirable, for the avoidance ofconstant references to London such as are at present necessary, that some authority in India should be vested forthwith, and in advance of the arrangements contem-plated with the setting up of the South-East Asia Command, with the necessarypower of co-ordination of all the organisations thus concerned in the dissemina-tion from India of Political Warfare matter against Japan. So far as concerns[25891]
the Department of Information and Broadcasting, the War Department of theGovernment of India and G.H.Q., India, and All-India Radio, the necessary-authority is vested by the Government of India Act in the Governor-General inCouncil and the Governor-General. But to secure the necessary degree ofco-ordination in respect of the Far Eastern Bureau, it is necessary to delegate tothe Governor-General authority to act on behalf of the Ministries concerned inthis country.4. Since this matter was first discussed there have been two importantdevelopments relevant to the question (a) the proposal, to which I have referred above, to establish a South-east asia Command under a British Supreme Commander separate from theCommander-in-Chief, India, though for the time being located inIndia; and(b) the acceptance by the-Viceroy of the attached draft directive as suitablefor the particular purpose of co-ordinating the Far Eastern Bureauwith Indian organisations, and as suitable in principle for applicationto the wider co-ordination entailed by (a). As, however, LordLinlithgow, in agreement with the Commander-in-Chief, India, con-siders that on the whole it would be better to avoid any further delay in applying this degree of co-ordination to the conduct of political warfare, I propose that I should be authorised to issue a directive tothe Viceroy forthwith in the terms given in the Appendix on theunderstanding that it may later be merged into any more compre-hensive authority that it may be necessary&quot; to give the Governor-General in the same extra-statutory capacity in relation to the South-East Asia Command.5. This proposal has the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War, andthe Minister of Information. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has alsoconcurred but wishes to reserve for later discussion the questions of the channel of communication with the Viceroy, the need for a political adviser to be attachedto him, and, finally, such arrangements as may be necessitated by the eventualsetting up of the Supreme Command.L. S. A.India Office, 6th August, 1943.
APPENDIX.Draft Directive to the Viceroy.THE position of the Ear Eastern Bureau in India as an agency of theMinistry of Information and the Political Warfare Executive has been underreview here in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for War and the Minister of Information. Since thefunctions of the Bureau require to be co-ordinated with those of various depart-ments of the Government of India, in particular with respect to political warfare, with a view to the avoidance of unnecessary reference to departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government on matters which require prompt disposal andon which special guidance from His Majesty&apos;s Government is otherwise notrequired, His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed that in virtue of the personalauthority deriving from your high office as Governor-General but outside andin addition to the statutory responsibilities of. that office you may representthem iiii jam pnrronnl r-ipnrify^aafcas Clim mini&apos; Conora^ in order to settle ontheir behalf by direct instructions to those in India subordinate to them matters relating to the conduct of Political Warfare against Japan, on which promptorders are required with a view to due co-ordination of their functions withthose of Departments of the Government of India, in particular the war department and the Department of Information and Broadcasting, and you arehereby authorised to exercise such control on their behalf. It is understood thaton all such matters on which you require special guidance you will, providedthat there is time, seek through me the instructions of the appropriate Depart-ment of His Majesty&apos;s Government and that you will, in any case, report to mefor the information of Flis Majesty&apos;s Government from time to time on theworking of this arrangement.Since under section 313 (2) (a) of the Government of India Act subject tothe provisions of that Act the executive authority of the Government of Indiaextends to the matters with respect to which the Indian Legislature has powerto make laws, and the functions of the Far Eastern Bureau in regard to theconduct of Political Warfare against Japan may extend to matters within thelegislative competence of the Indian Legislature, and thus may fall withinthe executive control of the Government of India, I further direct, underSection 314 (1) of the Government of India Act, that the Governor-General andthe Governor-General in Council shall in all matters relating to the operations in India of the Far Eastern Bureau so act as to enable the Far Eastern Bureauto function in accordance with such particular directions of the Ministry ofInformation or of the Political Warfare (Japan) Committee as they may receive from His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom or from yourself acting on their behalf in the manner indicated above.
