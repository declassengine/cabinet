THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET.py No.W.P. (43) 396.14th September, 1943.WAR CABINET.MORALE IN GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a paper on morale in germany which brings up to date the information contained in W.P. (43) 365 of the9th August. This paper represents the agreed views of the various Departmentsconcerned with this question, including the Service Departments. It is anattempt to assess the position in Germany on the eve of the unconditional surrender of Italy. It does not take account of German reactions to this event,regarding which adequate evidence is not vet available.A. E.Foreign Office, 14th September, 1943.Since the last report on German morale Germany&apos;s position has deterioratedsubstantially. On the Eastern front the Russians have staged a summer counter-offensive, which has resulted in the recapture of Orel, Kharkov, Taganrog andStalino, and which is still continuing. Thus for the first time the German armiesare being forced to yield ground to a Russian summer offensive. On the HomeFront the bombing offensive has been intensified and extended. Hamburg hasbeen devastated on an unparalleled scale; Berlin is under heavy attack and united States bombers have penetrated by day as far as Regensburg, Stuttgart,Schweinfurt and Wiener Neustadt. On the Southern Front, Mussolini and the fascist regime have been completely swept away and Italy has surrenderedunconditionally. Tension in the Balkans is growing. The &quot; model &quot; protectorate,Denmark, has had to be placed under martial law. The failure of the U-boatcampaign is at present complete and unconcealable.   The winter is approaching.The period under review has been a Critical one for German civilian morale.Until recently, while few Germans still believed in the likelihood of anoutright victory, fewer still believed in the inevitability of defeat. There was avery widespread feeling that Germany would by one means or another obtain a compromise peace on terms not too unfavourable to herself. The events of thepast two months have for the first time brought all but the most fervent Nazisface to face with the fact that Germany is in great danger of losing the war.At the same time conditions of life within the Reich are rapidly reaching a stage where many Germans are. beginning to wonder whether anything wouldnot be better than what they are having to suffer now. It is true that, unlike in1918, the food situation is not unsatisfactory. But the horrors of bombing, the inconvenience and discomfort of evacuation, the dislocation of social and economic life throughout the Reich, the complete regimentation of their private lives andanxiety over casualties to friends and relatives at home and abroad are combiningto make life almost intolerable.Finally, the collapse of Fascism in Italy, combined with a now widespreadfeeling that the Nazi leadership is failing to cope with the situation, has seriouslyundermined, the position of the Nazi regime. Belief in Hitler appears to bedeclining heavily, even amongst the general population, where it had hitherto been partly sustained, and has suffered a grave decrease amongst Party circles, wherebacksliding has become a serious problem.   The destruction of whole districts12151   [26075]
or cities by bombing and large-scale evacuation have both contributed to a notableweakening of Party control. Unless checked, these developments may lead to a rapid disintegration of the nation &apos;s will-power.It is not surprising that conditions on the Home Front are in the circum-stances causing great concern amongst those responsible for the conduct of thewar, more especially as enemy propaganda is now finding at least as strongcredence as the output of the Propaganda Ministry itself. To meet .this situation,there has been an intensification of the &quot; strength through fear&quot; campaign.Even though this campaign is beginning to lose some of its effect, there is nodoubt that fear of the consequences of defeat is the dominating factor sustainingGerman resistance.The main reaction, however, of the Nazi leadership has been the appointmentof Himmler Lo the position of Minister of the Interior in succession to Frick.This appointment, which, inter alia, gives Himmler direct control over regional and local administration, is highly significant. It is a sure indication that the nazi leadership.has no intention whatever of abdicating power and is preparing to take every possible measure to cope with existing difficulties and to dealruthlessly with any weakness that may develop in Germany.Nevertheless, there is a limit to what a regime of terror can achieve. Reportsof open criticism of Hitler and other political offences leave little doubt that the effectiveness of the policy of repression has decreased. Reports of strikes anddemonstrations are not fully substantiated, but there is abundant evidenceeverywhere that people are finding it necessary to give their personal safety and interests precedence over the needs of the war effort. In these circumstances, theParty&apos;s powers of coercion, though since Himmlers recent appointment theoreti-cally more complete than ever before and in practice still sufficient to prevent any effective organised popular opposition, seem to be reaching a point at which theinfluence which they can exert upon the attitude of the masses has a limit.Evidence is, in fact, accumulating that the authorities realise that a more ruthlessuse of their powers might provoke dangerous reactions and do more harm than good from the point of view of the prosecution of the war. The steady weakening of the nation&apos;s will-power as exemplified by increased apathy, a tendency tohysteria amongst women and general physical exhaustion is in many ways more dangerous than organised opposition, since it is more insidious and more difficultto combat.There has so far been no attempt on the part of the military leaders,industrialists or conservative circles generally to overthrow the Nazi regime witha view to securing peace. This possibility is, however, reported as being morefreely mooted in military circles, especially since Mussolini&apos;s fall.Morale in the armed forces generally continues to be better than on the HomeFront, although there are signs that it is beginning to be affected by anxiety overevents in Germany, particularly air raids The morale of U-boat crews has suffered a severe blow as a result of their heavy casualties, and they seemparticularly affected by their knowledge of the failures of the other services andof conditions on the Home Front.
