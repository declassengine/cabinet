naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Allied Naval forces have directly assisted in the final stages of theSicilian operations, providing gun support to the advancing armies, bombardingtargets on the Italian mainland and maintaining constant patrols off the coast and in the Strait of Messina.Allied destroyers and landing craft have successfully Landed:TJ.S. troops onVella Lavella Island in the Solomons, and an Allied naval force has inflictedcasualties on enemy destroyers in Vella Gulf.Shipping losses have been light, but German torpedo bombers have again been active on the North African routes and F.W. off the coast of Portugal.Two U-boats have been sunk, one probably sunk and one possibly sunk.Mediterranean.2. On the night of the lOth/llth U.S. cruisers and destroyers supported thesuccessful landing of U.S. troops east of Cape Orlando. During bombing attacks on the 11th the U.S. Cruiser Philadelphia was slightly damaged. Four enemy aircraft were shot down. On the night of the 15th/16th U.S. cruisers and destroyers covered ferrying operations on the left flank of the 7th Army atBarcellona, and ELM. destroyers and M.T.Bs. covered a successful commandolanding at Scaffletta, north of Taormina; some tanks were also landed and a battalion of infantry was ferried up the east coast on the 16th to reinforce theCommando.3. &apos; On the 12th H.M. Ships Uganda (cruiser) and Roberts (monitor) withdestroyers and the Dutch Gunboat Soemba engaged targets on the right flank ofthe 8th Army. The U.S. Cruiser Boise with two U.S. destroyers bombardedcoastal targets east of Cape Orlando. There were five casualties in Boise. Onthe night of the 12th/13th H.M.S. Scarab (gunboat) carried out an inshorebombardment of roads south of Taormina. On the 14th the U.S. Cruiser Boisewith U.S. destroyers bombarded Milazzo on the north coast of Sicily, and H.M.gunboats bombarded coast roads near Taormina. U.S. naval forces ferriedartillery round Cape Calava where a road tunnel was later demolished. On the15th H.M. Gunboat Aphis and the Dutch Gunboat Soemba bombarded the east coast road to Messina.4. Targets on the mainland of Italy have also been bombarded. On the night of the 13th/14th H.M. Cruisers Aurora said Penelope with two destroyerscarried out a sweep off the west coast of Italy and bombarded the harbour ofVibo Valentia where large fires were started and a coaster was blown up. On thefollowing night two cruisers bombarded Scalea (south-east of Naples). On the night of the 15th/16th HM. Cruisers Sirius and Dido with two destroyers bombarded Vibo Valentia and sank a southbound lighter and two M.Ls. off cape Bonifati. On the night of the 17th/18th HALS. Penelope (cruiser) sweptthe Gulf of Policastro and later bombarded Scalea.5. A constant patrol off the Italian mainland and the coasts of Sicily hasbeen maintained by Allied naval forces. On the 15th H.M.S. Troubriclge(destroyer) was torpedoed by an E-boat off Catania,- but reached Malta on thefollowing day.6. Allied light craft have constantly patrolled the Strait of Messina, andon the night of the 11th/12th M.T.B&apos;s. attacked three ships entering Messinaharbour; an explosion was heard, but there was no definite evidence of destruc-tion or damage. Early on the 15th M.T.B. 665 was sunk off Messina; somesurvivors were rescued. On the night of the 15th/16th another M.T.B. was damaged.7. During an air raid on Augusta on the night of the 9th/10th H.M.Destroyers Tynedale and Nubian were slightly damaged. A daylight raid on the15th narrowly missed H.M.S. Ledbury (destroyer) and other ships in the harbour.8. A swept channel has been established inside the ^Egadean Islands and into Marsala, where a port party has been established since the 9th. At Syracuseon the 11th 4,700 tons were discharged, and at Palermo on the 13th 5,000 tons.Ships are being efficiently fuelled from the oil fuel installation at Augusta, wherethe former civilian staff is now re-employed.   At Palermo the aqueducts and
municipal electricity service are functioning normally. Much Italian labour hasbeen found for harbour work. The beaches north-east and south-west of PortoPalo were closed on the 14th.9. The following reports have been received from H.M. Submarines : On the6th Uproar torpedoed a 6,000-ton ship off Bari (north-west of Brindisi) and onthe 7th Rorqual sank a 2,500-ton ship in convoy off the Dardanelles and bombardedthe resin factory at Khrouso. On the 11th Unshaken sank an inward bound7,000-ton ship off Brindisi and Unruly, in the same area, caused a tanker to bebeached and probably torpedoed another ship.H.M. Submarines Parthian and Saracen are overdue and must be presumed lost.Pacific.10. TJ.S. submarines operating against Japanese supply lines have sunkseven ships and damaged five others.The US. Submarine Pickerel is overdue and must be considered lost.Solomons.11. On the night of the 10th/11th Allied patrol craft encountered two smallauxiliary craft south-west of Kolombangara Island and probably sank one ofthem.On the 11th a successful U.S. seaborne raid on Vella Lavelia Island resultedin the capture of 140 unarmed Japanese.On the 15th U.S. troops were landed on the island from Allied destroyers and landing craft, and two days later it was announced that U.S. troops had occupied the island and had captured 350 enemy refugees.An Allied naval force engaged four Japanese destroyers escorting barges inthe Vella Gulf. Two enemy destroyers were seriously damaged, one of them beingprobably sunk, and a third was damaged. Most of the barges were destroyed or seriously damaged.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. During the week 17 attacks on U-boats have been reported; 11 by aircraft, and six by ships. Flying operations have again been restricted by weather.On the 11th aircraft from the U.S.S. Card (auxiliary carrier) sank a U-boatnorth-west of the Azores and on the 12th a Liberator (B.24) sank another south-east of Cape Verde Islands. Seven survivors were picked up. The aircraft was shot down, the crew being killed.A Japanese U-boat was probably sunk by the U.S.S. Buchanan (destroyer)north of the New Hebrides Islands (S.W. Pacific) and a German U-boat waspossibly sunk by H.M. destroyers south of Iceland (C).Enemy Intelligence.German.13. It is reported that 11 destroyers and two A.A. ships (probably ex-Norwegian coast defence ships) are with the Tirpitz, Scharnhorst and Lutzoiv inAlten Fjord.Three Italian blockade runners and two or three smaller ships remain in harbour at Bordeaux.Reconnaissance on the 18th located the Scheer at Swinemunde.Italian.14. On the 14th one Italia battleship was seen to have returned to Speziafrom Genoa; all three battleships of this class are now at Spezia.. reconnaissance of Genoa shows that work on the conversion of one Regolo class cruiser into an aircraft carrier has been suspended.Japanese.15. A number of small convoys escorted by warships have arrived at Rabauland at ports in the north of New Guinea. Reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 13thshowed. 19 cargo ships totalling 85,000 tons.-   .[25957] &apos; b 2
It is estimated that between the 27th July and the 4th August Allied aircraft destroyed 94 barges used to bring Japanese troops and supplies to Lae andSalamoa from Madang and possibly from Wewak. Reconnaissance, however,shows that the enemy has a large reserve of barges on the coast of northern new guinea and anchorages of New Britain.U-boats.16. It is estimated that 55 U-boats are at present operating in the atlantic and not more than six in the Indian Ocean. Eight Italian U-boats are reportedto be available for blockade running to the Far East. Three of these have probably arrived in the Ear East.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17. During the week U-boats ax^e reported to have attacked four ships, ofwhich two are known to have sunk.Two ships in a homeward bound convoy were torpedoed, one of which was sunk, south of Cape Race. One ship was sunk off Mauritius and another was torpedoed off the Friendly Islands in the S. Pacific.A westbound convoy, 100 miles east of Gibraltar, was attacked by 37 Heinkel111, four of which were shot down. Two ships were torpedoed but reachedGibraltar. One ship was sunk and two were damaged during an attack by18 F.W. on an outward bound convoy north-west of Cape St. Vincent. Onewestbound ship in convoy, carrying 1,800 Italian prisoners of war, was torpedoedby aircraft off Bone. About 320 prisoners were killed. A straggler from aneastbound convoy was sunk by aircraft off Philippeville. One ship was sunk andtwo others damaged in an air raid on Bizerta.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 15th, 932 ships were convoyed. Of these,294 ships were in ocean convoys and 638 in British coastal convoys. Seventy-ninedestroyers (including 12 United States destroyers), 97 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including eight United States cutters) and two cruisers were employedon escort duties.Three ocean convoys, consisting of 129 ships, arrived in the United kingdom without loss.19. During the week ending the 14th, imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 928..000 tons compared with 1,063,000 during the previous seven days and an average of 991,300 tons during the past ten weeks. Of theweek&apos;s imports 363,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.British Minelaying.20. During the week surface craft laid mines in Northern Waters. Air-craft laid mines off the Dutch and German North Sea Coasts and in the Bay of biscay.   -Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.21. Minelaying by enemy aircraft may have taken place on two nights ofthe week off Plymouth and between Yarmouth and Flamborough Headrespectively.E-boats may have laid mines in the Thames Estuary on the night of the15th/ 16th.The dangerous area off the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight has nowbeen cleared. -The mine totals are 4,447 ground, 3,045 moored:M editerxanean.22.   Ninety-one mines have been destroyed off the west coast of Sicily.A dangerous area, due to moored mines, has been declared to the east ofTripoli (L).About 600 German and a similar number of Italian mines were captured atTrapani.
Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. A Spanish tug, a lighter with salvage machinery and about 100 menwere reported on the 17th to have left Ferrol for Camarinas, and to have startedsalvage work on the wreck of the German tanker Nord Atlantic (9,897 tons)which was loaded with 4,000 tons of oil. The latter is now being removed by asmall tanker and will presumably be bought by Spain.24.   Recent movements together with the increased rate of oil shipment&apos; from Constanza since the beginning of June, indicate that goods previouslyrouted to the Greek mainland and the ^aegean, via Trieste, and the Adriatic arenow being sent down the Danube and thence through the Dardanelles to the aegean.  It was reported on the 13th that Russian magnetic mining of the DanubeI      was causing considerable dislocation of traffic.25. The. torpedoing of the Firuz (7,327 .tons) on the 6th by a Russiansubmarine in the Black Sea is reported to have reduced the number of tankers atthe disposal of Germany in the Black Sea and iEgean to three, totalling 9,345tons, all of which are believed to be under repair, and a number of small tankerstotalling about 1,500 tons.The tanker Bacchus (1,810 tons) was reported to have loaded 1,300 tons of oil from the Firuz at Istanbul and to be leaving shortly for the iEgean.MILITARY SITUATION.Sicily.26. By the 13th the enemy evacuation from Sicily had started and fromthen onwards the main delay to our progress was caused by mines and demolitions.On the Eighth Army coastal sector, after the capture of Riposto on the12th, good progress was made towards Taormina which we entered unopposed onthe 15th, That night a commando raid, with a small armoured force in support,was made 16 miles up the coast in an attempt to cut off enemy forces and tcengage rear guards which were holding us up in Santa Teresa. An unsuccessfulcounter-attack was, in fact, put in from here which we held off without difficulty and our advance continued. Elements of an armoured unit entered Messina at1000 hours on the 17th.In the central sector we made steady progress against determinedGerman rear guards. The defences of Randazzo finally broke under intenseartillery and aerial bombardment and the town was entered by the U.S.Seventh Army on the 13th closely followed by British troops. Since then themain task of the latter has been clearing the Randazzo-Fiumefreddo road.Further north the U.S. Seventh Army cleared the road running north from Randazzo, through Novara to the coast, and consolidated this area.On the north coast every effort was made to maintain contact with theenemy. U.S. naval craft were used to ferry artillery and heavy equipmentforward to keep up with the infantry. In spite of heavy demolitions, to whichthis road is particularly well suited, the U.S. Forces made good progresspassing through Barcellona on the 15th; the same evening they by-passed Milazzoand were eight miles east of the town. By 1100 hours on the 16th their forward troops had reached the road, junction east of Bauzo where they turned east, cutacross the tip of the island, and the following morning were shelling Messina.Messina, our final objective, was entered at 2000 hours on the 16th andthe Sicilian campaign was over.Although the final count has yet to be made it is estimated that 130,000prisoners are in our hands, to which figure moist be added many thousands ofItalians who deserted and are now in plain clothes. Other casualties, killed and wounded, are believed to be 30,000, of which 23,000 are German. It is impossibleyet to estimate the quantity of war material captured, but tanks, guns and small arms are lying scattered all over the island.The Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad Sector.27. The Germans have continued to report large-scale Russian attacks southof Lake Ladoga. While there is still no confirmation of these reports, it is not unlikely that the Russians have been making holding attacks to. prevent theGermans from moving forces southwards to meet the Russian attack in theSmolensk sector.
Smolensk Sector.28. On the 13th the Russians announced an offensive south-west and southof Vyasma, which the Germans had already been reporting for some days past.The Russians made good initial progress along the railway Sukhinichi-Smolensk,advancing some 25 miles and reaching a point on the railway 70 miles east ofSmolensk. . The salient thus formed was later widened towards the south-west,but for the last few days the Russians appear to have made little further progressof importance.Bryansk-Orel Sector.29. The Russians have continued to make steady progress, more particularly to the north of the Orel-Bryansk railway. They have captured Shizdra, Karachevand Dmitrovsk, and. their line now runs a few miles to the west of these threetowns.   Fighting is now taking place in forest country to the east of Bryansk.Kharkov Sector.30. The Russians continued to advance fairly rapidly towards the south-west and south, reaching a point 30 miles north-east of Poltava and cutting theKharkov-Poltava railway. Since the 13th the Germans have been counter-attacking against the salient west of Kharkov and although these counter-attacksdo not appear to have regained any ground for the Germans they seem to have so far prevented any further Russian advance in this area.To the north and east of Kharkov the Russians have been slowly closing inon the city but have had to fight against strong and steady German resistance.They are. now within a few miles of the city on the north.Burma.A arakan, -31. An attack by small Japanese detachments was made on our monsoonpositions, five miles north-east of Maungdaw, on the 14th and was repulsed.Concentrations of enemy troops in the valleys on the eastern slopes of theMayu Range, south of Buthidaung, have been reported.On other fronts activity was confined to patrols.South-West Pacific Area.New Guinea.32. Several enemy counter-attacks to dislodge our troops from Mount Tambuhave been repulsed with heavy enemy casualties.South Pacific Area.New Georgia.33. U.S. troops are engaged in clearing and repairing Munda airfield andare making slow progress against stiff resistance towards Bairoko, on the north-west coast of the island, where the last remaining Japanese garrison, a fewhundred strong, is located. Heavy rain is hindering their progress, but theJapanese garrison is now encircled and U.S. forces are within two miles ofBairoko.AIR SITUATION.General Review.34. Heavy attacks were made by home-based bombers on industrial targets in Germany and Northern Italy and on airfields in France and the Low Countries.A concentration of bombing was continued against the beaches and communi-cations in Southern Italy and the Messina Area. U.S. bombers made a heavy attack on the Rome railway centres, and airfields in the South of France.Allied aircraft inflicted heavy losses on Japanese aircraft in New Guinea andthe Solomons.
United Kingdom.35. In daylight 11 enemy reconnaissance aircraft flew over the south coast;two were destroyed. At night 91 enemy aircraft were reported overland. Onthe night of the 15th/16th, 24 bombers crossed the south coast, and on the17th/ 18th, 50 enemy aircraft, some of which were fighter-bombers, operated overthe S., S.E. and E. Coasts. On another night 15 fighter-bombers flew over the EastKent coast and the Thames Estuary. Ten enemy bombers were destroyed byMosquitoes and two by A.A., three others were probably destroyed and two moredamaged.Coastal Operations.36. Aircraft of Fighter Command sank four E-boats and a minesweeper and damaged two ships of about 600 tons off the French and Belgian coasts.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 87 were despatched, laid 179 mines in enemy waters; five aircraft are missing.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.37: Fortresses (B. 17) of the U.S. VIIIth  Bomber Command attacked thefollowing targets : Date.

A Mosquito, which attacked the target, later reported that the works were considerably damaged and that fires were&apos; still burning.Allied fighters, which flew 4,379 sorties as cover and support for all these operations, and in sweeps, destroyed 64 enemy aircraft, probably &quot;destroyed 10 and damaged 26 for the loss of 23.Night.38. On the night the 7th/18th, 597 aircraft of Bomber Command were despatched to attack the experimental R.D.F. establishment at Peenemunde(60 miles N.W. of Stettin); 525 attacked, dropping 1,757 tons of bombs.
Weather over the target was cloudless with good visibility. At the outsetvisual identification of the target was possible, but later arrivals report thatground details were obscured by a smoke-screen and by smoke from fires.The marker bombs were dropped punctually and accurately, resulting in a heavy and concentrated attack. A preliminary interpretation of photographs taken by a Mosquito of Coastal Command shows very heavy damage (seeAppendix VI). Forty aircraft are missing and three enemy aircraft were destroyed.Mosquitoes made four small-scale attacks on Berlin; two aircraft are missing.Intruders attacked airfields and communications in France, the low countries and IS&quot;.W. Germany; nine enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground and in the air, four locomotives were destroyed and about 50 were damaged, a railway bridge was destroyed, and a blast furnace was hit. Leaflets were dropped on several towns in France.   Four of our aircraft are missing.North Italy.39. Aircraft cf Bomber Command delivered attacks on Milan on three nights of the week. Out of 843 aircraft despatched, 791 attacked, dropping2,217 tons of bombs. Weather over the tahget was good and the three attacks were very successful and well concentrated. Photographs taken 36 hours after the firstattack show that there was heavy damage in the target area (see Appendix VI).The pilots of Mosquitoes which flew over the target after the other attacks reportthat smoke covered most of the town.Turin was attacked on two nights by a total of 256 out of 306 aircraft dispatched; 448 tons of bombs were dropped in good weather conditions. Themarker bombs were accurately placed and well maintained. A good concentration of fires was achieved and several explosions were observed.Seventeen aircraft are missing from these operations and four enemy aircraft were shot down.Austria.40. On the 13th, 114 Liberators (B. 24) were despatched to attack an air-craft factory and aircraft assembly plant at Vienna/Neustadt (20 miles S. of vienna). Owing to technical troubles and bad visibility 33 of the heavy bombersmade no attack. About seven enemy fighters attacked our aircraft over the target and at least 13 others tried to intercept off the Italian coast, two were destroyed and two Liberators (B. 24) are missing. Over 100 tons of bombs were dropped; results of the attack are given in Appendix VI.Mediterranean.Southern Italy and Sicily.   .41. In the early part of the week, the Tactical Air Force continued to attacktargets in Sicily in support of our land forces. Heavy attacks were made oncommunications and troop concentrations at Randazzo, Fiume Freddo, Pedimonteand Falcone.Until the island was in our hands, bombing was concentrated against the beaches between Messina and Cape Pelora, and on ammunition dumps, troop concentrations and guns in the area north of Messina. A heavy concentration of bombing was also maintained on Italian beaches on the mainland, and,communications in Southern Italy. At night, in these operations, Wellingtonsflew 509 sorties. Bostons (A. 20), Baltimores (A. 30), Liberators (B. 24)and Hali faxes made a further number of attacks. Mosquitoes from malta operated every night against rail and road communications. By day these operations were continued on an intensive scale by medium, light, and fighter bombers. Railway centres were hit, radio-location and power houses were damaged, hits were made on roads and bridges, two E-boats and a number ofSiebel ferries and barges sunk. Fighters flew many.offensive sweeps. The scale of defensive effort maintained by enemy aircraft was negligible.On one night, 35 enemy aircraft, attempting to bomb our airfields in theCatania-Augusta area, were intercepted by Beaufighters; five J.U. 88. were destroyed. NOn the 13th, 106 Fortresses (B. 17) escorted by 45 Lightnings (P. 38) attacked the Lorenzo railway centre, Rome, and 66 Mitchells (B. 25) and 102 Marauders
(B. 26) escorted by 100 Lightnings (P. 38) bombed the Littorio railway centre,Borne. Between 30 and 40 enemy fighters were encountered, five being destroyed;two Marauders (B. 26) were lost. About 450 tons of bombs were dropped; resultsshown by photographic reconnaissance are given in Appendix VI.Forty Fortresses (B. 17) attacked term  (45 miles north of Rome). hits were made on numerous factory buildings, the gas works, the station and railwaysidings; two trains were set on fire and severe damage was caused in the town.A few enemy aircraft, intercepted and one bomber is missing.Eighty-four Liberators (B. 24) attacked the Tortorella and San Nicolaairfields at Foggia, 152 tons of bombs were dropped. Hits were made in the dispersal areas, on railway trucks and workshops, and two large oil fires were started. Of 75 to 100 enemy aircraft that intercepted 43 were destroyed; eightLiberators (B. 24) are missing. Forty-eight escorted Marauders (B. 26) bombedGrazzanise (10 miles NiW. of Naples) where the dispersal areas and airfieldswere well covered; 12 enemy fighters were shot down and five Lightnings (P. 38)were lost. Two of the Cotrone landing grounds were bombed by 45 escortedMitchells (B. 25). A total of eight Wellingtons dropped leaflets on northern italy iand Rome.Sardinia.42; A total of 94 war hawks (P. 40F) carried out two offensive sweepsover the southern area.; A number of small boats were machine-gunned and a power station at San Anticco was damaged. Many hits were made withfragmentation bombs in the camp area east of the airfield at Cagliari/Monserrato.North Africa.   -43. On the night of the 17th/18th, 80 enemy bombers made a heavy attackon Bizerta. Many bombs were dropped over a wide area; an oil fire was started.Eight enemy bombers were destroyed,On the 17th a U.S. Liberator (B. 24), operating from Port Lyautey, onconvoy escort duty, shot down a F.W. 200. The Liberator (B. 24) also crashedinto the sea; both crews were rescued by surface craft.Attacks on Shipping.44. Beaufighters torpedoed two 4,000-ton ships 50 miles west of Naples:Medium bombers obtained near misses on two ships of 7,000 tons north ofMessina. Forty-eight Mitchells (B. 25) bombed and machine-gunned shipping in the Gulf of Gioia.   Mitchells (B. 25) attacked and set on fire a ship off Pizzo.Wellingtons and Beaufighters made numerous attacks on shipping off thewest coast of Greece. A 2,000-ton ship was torpedoed and a possible hit obtained on another of about the same size. Several small ships and caiques were eithersunk or damaged. The seaplane bases at Corfu and Argastoli were attacked,and the harbour and landing ground at Kalamata were bombed.South of France.45. On the 17th, 194 Fortresses (B. 17) were despatched from North africa to attack the airfields at Istres Le Tube and Salon de Province, 15 and 20 milesrespectively from Marseilles. At the former bursts were seen on 15 aircraft and fires and explosions observed; at the latter many hits were made ongrounded aircraft and large fires started amongst the hangars. ThreeME. 109s were encountered, one of which was probably destroyed; two Fortresses(B. 17) were destroyed by A.A.Battle Casualties and Sorties.46. During the week ending the 17th, 86 enemy aircraft were destroyed;42 Allied aircraft were lost.   A total of 8,035 sorties was flown.Russia.47. The Russian Air Force was heavily engaged in close support of theirground forces, particularly in the Kharkov area. By night, bombers havestrongly attacked railway communications, chiefly in the area south-west ofKharkov, where Krasnodar and Poltava were the chief targets.[25957] c
iUReconnaissance and harassing flights were carried out over NorthFinland. Russian ground-attack aircraft were active south of Lake Ladoga.Successes are claimed against German shipping in the Barents and Black Seas.The day by day claims of German aircraft shot down over the whole front reach a total of nearly 450.As the Russians close in on Kharkov and press onwards from Orel towardsBriansk, it appears that the G.A.F. is falling back to airfields on the Dneiperfrom Dnepropetrovsk to Krementschug, and thence northwards through Konotopto the line of the Desna. It is hardly to be doubted that the enforced movewestwards of the essential ground organisation is having adverse effects on the operational efficiency of flying units; the present scale of activity is reported tobe only one-third of that attained during the initial stages of the german offensive.in early July. Details of G.A.F. activity are not available; but there is reason to think that the air force is fully extended along the whole front fromSmolensk to the Sea of Azov, with main concentrations in the Kharkov andBriansk-Smolensk areas.Burma.48. Allied aircraft continuously attacked enemy communications, especiallyin the Mandalay and Arakan areas and on the Irrawaddy River. A railwaytunnel near Mandalay was seriously damaged, and a large number of river craft and railway trucks was destroyed or damaged. Off Diamond Island (113 miles.E. of Rangooon) an enemy ship was sunk and a motor ship was damaged. .Attacks were also made on supply bases and on barracks, huts and villagesoccupied by the enemy. An electric power station at Akyab was attacked by wellingtons which dropped seven tons of bombs.Dakotas (C. 47) dropped large quantities of supplies for Allied troops in north Burma, the Chin Hills and at Goppe Bazaar (69 miles N.N.W. of Akyab).Liberators (B. 24) dropped six tons of bombs on Chatham Island in theAndamans, damaging buildings and warehouses.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.49. On the night of 16th/7th and on the following day, afterreconnaissance had revealed heavy reinforcements of Japanese aircraft in theWewak area, attacks in force were made by Allied aircraft on a concentration of 225 aircraft. All but ten of the aircraft were destroyed and a further 28intercepting fighters were shot down for the loss of six Allied, aircraft. It isestimated that about 1,500 air personnel were killed. An attack was also madeon Wewak harbour where three ships were set on&apos;fire and barges sunk.Several attacks were made on Saiamaua and neighbouring villages, about600 tons of bombs being dropped.
