THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;&quot; 1 11- (Printed&apos; for &quot;the [War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 365.9th August, 1943.WAR CABINET.MORALE IN GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a paper representing the agreed viewsof the various Departments concerned with this question, including the service departments, and bringing up to date the information contained in W.P. (43) 154of the 14th April, 1943. This paper represents an attempt to assess the positionin Germany on the eve of Mussolini&apos;s fall from power. It does not take accountof German reactions to the latter event, regarding which adequate evidence is notyet available.A. E.  &apos;Foreign Office, 9th [August, 1943.The three months that have passed since the last report was circulatedhave been a period of waiting for the German people. They have been warned that the war has now entered the defensive stage and that it will be long, but thatdespite Allied successes on the periphery the fortress of Europe will hold out.The principal new developments in the situation have not been reassuring to them.On the Eastern front the military initiative, after an exceptionally long springlull, has now to a considerable extent passed to the Russians. The German armyin North Africa has been destroyed and the invasion of Sicily begun. The hopespinned on Admiral Doenitz&apos;s U-boat offensive have been disappointed. TheAllied air offensive, directed mainly towards the systematic elimination of theindustrial towns of the Ruhr and the Rhineland, has steadily mounted in intensity, and German incapacity to hit back has become increasinglyapparent. The breaching of the Mohne and Eder Dams has caused.widespreadalarm. The weakness of Germany&apos;s allies, especially Italy, has become increas-ingly evident. The meat ration has been cut. The strict regimentation of allphases of the nation&apos;s life has continued.2. The changed tone of German propaganda reflects official concern over thestrained condition of German opinion. Increasing attention is being paid tominority opinion on important issues, which is beginning openly to discussquestions such as shortcomings on the home front, the strength of the army, &amp;c.The fall in. tonnage sunk by U-boats has had to be admitted. Great pains havebeen taken to allay public anxiety about the disparity between German and allied production. An intensive campaign has been launched against rumour-mongers and grumblers, especially in connexion wdth air raids. The attempt to minimise air raid damage and casualties has been abandoned and the civilian population of. the Ruhr is now described as being in the front line.3. The course of events has given more Germans than before the inclinationto trust their own judgment against the Propaganda Ministry&apos;s, and to look afterthemselves at the expense of the German war effort. Few now believe in outrightmilitary victory and some admit that the war is lost. Nevertheless, the. majoritywill not yet admit that defeat is inevitable Confidence in the ability of theGerman army at least to hold the Russians on the Eastern Front is strong&quot; and thehope is still widespread that the Allies will be held at bay long enough to enableGermany to exploit their differences and conclude a compromise peace, whichmight represent a political victory for Germany or at worst guarantee anindependent existence for the Reich.12125   [25903]Copy No.
4. Fear of the consequences of defeat remains a strong,consolidating factor.Most Germans still believe that Germany is fighting to save&apos; European culturefrom destruction, and German propaganda preaches incessantly that the Jewswho brought about the war and are responsible for the bombing terror will show no^mercy-if they enter Germany, either from the East or from the West. Officialpropaganda is exploiting the air-raids to increase fear and hatred of theWestern Powers; but a widespread feeling persists that surrender to the latter is far to be preferred to falling victim to Russian vengeance. There is some evidence that the Bolshevik bogy is beginning to be regarded by the public withsome scepticism; but its hold is still strong.5. As the prospects of victory recede and living conditions deteriorate,signs of discontent are coming to the surface, and the sacrifices demanded bythe war are being accepted more and more unwillingly by the mass of the people.In the west the population has suffered very heavily. There is evidence that,especially among the professional and intellectual classes, the less spirited are beginning to demand a respite at any cost. The working classes have stood the strain better but the capacity even of the most determined to carry on has undoubtedly been weakened. Moreover, the effects of air raids are now makingthemselves felt throughout the Reich, not only through the widespread evacuation of victims but also through the dislocation of the supply situation resulting fromdamage to production in the bombed areas. The authorities are showingincreasing concern over the effect of air raids on the spirit of the people and aremaking great efforts to alleviate it, particularly in heavily bombed areas, by special distributions of food. These palliatives have done little to compensate for the disruption of daily life, which has, in addition, hampered the Party&apos;sclose supervision of the activities of individuals. The acute shortage of housing-has, in many cases, either made evacuation impossible, thereby causing irritationand dismay, or has complicated billeting and given rise to friction between theauthorities,, the householders and the evacuees. Clothes and other consumer goods are practically unobtainable except for air-raid victims and even the latterhave great difficulty in procuring what they need.6. Strikes are reported to have occurred in the Ruhr. They have beenattributed by German opinion largely to the influence of foreign workers, whohave become a source of serious preoccupation, not only to the civilian popula-tion, but also to the police. Strikes have also been reported in Austria, whereopinion is more buoyant and less disciplined and misgivings about the high proportion of foreign workers have been particularly marked. In one case, atleast, the authorities have proved unable to check the hooliganism and lootingwhich spread through a heavily bombed town in Western Germany. There is some evidence that the minor Party officials are becoming reluctant to wear their part badges and are becoming slack in their supervision of the people&apos;s politicalattitude. In South-West Germany the necessity for a Party purge has been mentioned in official speeches. The forces of repression are, however, still strong and capable of preventing any organised subversive activity.7. During the period under review the prestige of the regime has declinedand the German Government is hard put to it to maintain public confidence.A .major development such as the collapse of Italy might have great results.Hitler&apos;s virtual disappearance from the public scene at a time when the homefront requires his inspiration has aroused misgivings, and criticism of theFiihrer has increased, particularly in Army circles, regarding his militaryleadership. But he appears to retain his hold upon the masses. Though thereare undoubtedly personal antagonisms within the Party and some internal tensionwithin the High Command, there is still no sign of the existence of any factionwhich might attempt to replace Hitler by a coup de main.8. There is little indication of deterioration in the fighting spirit of the armed forces. No evidence of a break in morale or of bad discipline has beenfound among the German army units captured in Tunisia or Sicily. There is some evidence of a decline in the fighting value of the German air force. AmongU-boat crews complete indifference and ignorance about political matters isnormal, but there are signs of increasing interest in such things among pettyofficers and of a decrease in fanaticism among commanders, which has been reflected in reluctance to press home attacks.
