THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 371.16th August, 1943.UNITED NATIONS PLAN.Judicial- and Arbitral Machinery.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will &quot;no doubt wish to read this most valuable note by theChief Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office.A. E.Foreign Office, 16th August, 1943.It is natural that in the middle of a world war the view should be held that &apos;&apos; in present circumstances international law could not be said to exist inany real sense&quot;; exactly the same thing was said- in the last war. But Inevertheless believe that this view is mistaken; we do not consider that Englishcriminal law has ceased to exist because crimes are committed every day.Moreover, this view seems to rest on the assumption that the essential part ofinternational law is concerned with preventing an outbreak of war, and that ifsuch occurs it shows that international law does not exist. This is really notthe case. In fact until the adoption of such Instruments as the Covenant ofthe League, the Pact of Paris and Treaties of Non-x\ggression (practically all of which date from since the last war), an outbreak of war did not normallyinvolve any breach of international law at ail. The greater part of internationallaw is concerned with regulating the ordinary intercourse of nations in peacetime, and on the whole this sort of international law is pretty well observed; &apos;it isfor cases arising in this domain that an international judicial system isparticularly required. In any case, we are surely not going to proceed on thebasis that under the proposed Four-Power system the world is going to be entirelylawless.It is no doubt possible to exaggerate the part which the judicial settlementof international disputes can usefully play in the world order, and I think thatthis was done to some extent in the period between the two wars. It is also possible to make the mistake of attempting to deal by judicial machinery with what are really political questions, and in this sense I.should agree that &quot; theonly matters likely to be referred to a World Court with any hope of success wouldbe matters of no political importance.&quot; But, (1) if a dispute is really of a legalcharacter, the fact that it is important does not necessarily mean that to refer it to a competent Court would not be the best means of disposing of it, thoughadmittedly in some cases political considerations may render some other methodof settlement desirable; and (2) the question of what is &apos;&apos; important &apos;&apos; is alwaysa relative one; a dispute between small Powers may be important to them, butit does not follow that they would not be prepared to have it decided by judicialsettlement, or that they could not be easily compelled to do so by the Big Four.The view was expressed in the Committee that &quot;arbitration,&quot; in the sense of the reference of particular disputes to arbitrators selected ad hoc, was preferable to the establishment and use of a standing International Court. Fromthis view I feel bound to express dissent. The judicial settlement of international disputes has gone through three phases : (1) reference to the decision of the Head *of a third State; (2) reference to arbitrators selected.ad hoc either from existing12132   [25936]Copy No. ti* o
panels (the system of the Permanent Court of Arbitration) or at large:(3) reference to a standing International. Tribunal of fixed composition thesystem of the Permanent Court of International Justice. Each stage was an advance on the former one, and there is, I &apos;should have thought, pretty generalunanimity among those interested in the subject that the establishment of aPermanent Court with a fixed composition was the greatest advance which hadbeen made in the judicial settlement of international disputes. This is borne out by the fact that, since the establishment of the Permanent Court of Inter-national Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (which is a panel system)has not been employed once. I feel convinced that a proposal to revert to thesystem of &apos;&apos; arbitration &apos;&apos; would be almost universally regarded as a retrograde step, completely ignoring the results of experience and putting the clock back atleast a quarter of a century. As regards His Majesty&apos;s Government, the PrimeMinister said on the 21st March, 1943 We must try to make the Councilof Europe, or whatever it may be called, into a really effective league with all the strongest forces concerned woven into its texture, with a High Court to adjustdisputes.....&quot; .A small inter-Allied Committee has recently been established to consider thequestion of the Permanent Court of International Justice, When proposing this to the Allies, we said that the only assumption which it was necessary to makewas that some form of International Court would be required in future, and this assumption has been accepted without question by every Government represented on the Committee. If we are now to say that we think no such Court is required,it will cause considerable surprise (particularly, I should have thought, to publicopinion in this country), and I doubt whether we should receive support fromany other of the United Nations except the U.S.S.R., who has never taken any interest in the judicial settlement of international disputes. I do hot know whatthe views of the American Administration may be. but I cannot remember havingseen any American proposals for the future world order which did not contain a reference to some &apos;&apos; World Court.&apos;&apos;I &quot;suggest, in general, that our idea should be to set up the best permanentInternational Court that we can, and that it should then be for the united nations organisation to decide, either in its written constitution, if it exists,or otherwise, in what circumstances recourse should be had to it. But for thepurposes of the paper on the &apos;&apos; United Nations Plan &apos;&apos; no very definite proposalsseem to be necessary; and I should have thought that a general reference to theemployment of appropriate machinery for the judicial settlement of international disputes of a legal character should suffice.H. W. MALKIN.lQth August, 1943.
