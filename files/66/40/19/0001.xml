AIR situation from 0700 5th August, to0700 12th August,--&quot;--.1943[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   Allied ships have continued to support military operations in sicily and have carried out a bombardment in the Bay o&apos;f Naples.An Italian cruiser has been torpedoed.A Japanese cruiser and, two-destroyers have been sunk in the Solomons.Shipping losses have been light.Two U-boats have been sunk, one probably sunk, one possibly sunk and threeprobably damaged.Home Waters.2. Coastal forces engaged enemy trawlers on the night of the 3rd/4th off theDutch coast.  Two M.G.Bs were damaged in collision during the action.Mediterranean.3. Ustica Island (north of Palermo) was occupied by U.S. naval andmilitary forces on the 5th.On the night of the 7th/8th, U.S. naval forces provided cover for a landing at Cape Orlando (N.E. Sicily). The U.S. cruisers Philadelphia and Savannahwere heavily but ineffectively bombed while acting in support.. On the samenight, on the east coast, H.M. destroyers bombarded Taormina. On the 8th,H.M.S. Mauritius (cruiser) with two destroyers bombarded Giarre, Riposto and north Acireale (all north of Catania). On the night of the 9th/10th, H.M.Cruisers Aurora and Penelope bombarded Castellamare (Bay of Naples). TheDutch Gunboat Soemba was damaged by the fire of a shore battery off Taorminaon the 5th : there were three casualties. H.M.S. Roberts (monitor) was slightly damaged during an air attack at Augusta on the 9th.4. Since the 10th July, 41,000 personnel, 8,900 vehicles and 40,000 tonsof stores have been landed on the beaches between Avola and Syracuse. the beaches were closed on the 6th.Work continues on the harbour at Palermo, where the rate of unloading ishampered by the necessity of using tank landing craft.Of a total of 948 British and 776 U.S. landing craft used in the initiallandings on Sicily, enemy action and weather conditions caused the loss of 11British and 125 U.S. craft, while&apos;22 British and 54 U.S. were out of action for over 14 days.5. H.M. S/M Simoom obtained two torpedo hits on an Italian 6&quot; cruiserof the Luigi Di Savoia class on the 9th off Spezia. H.M. S/M Unruffled sank a12,000-ton transport inward bound off Brindisi on the 3rd, H.M. S/M Unrivalled.sank a small schooner by gunfire and took four prisoners north of Stromboli onthe 24th and, on the following day, shelled a schooner in tow of a small tug, both ofwhich were driven ashore and abandoned, off Cape Spartivento.The U.S. destroyers Gherardi and Rhind sank a landing lighter and anE-boat south of the Lipari Islands on the night of the 3rd/4th.6. The s.s. Fort La Montee (7,134 tons) caught fire while unloading munitionson the 4th in Algiers harbour and subsequently sank : about 50 of the crew are missing. H.M.S. Arrow (destroyer), in rendering assistance, was seriously damaged by fire and sustained 55 casualties, including 25 killed.The naval signal station at Bizerta was damaged during an air raid on the night of the 6th/7th : there were 12 ratings wounded.Black Sea.7. Russian submarines, during the last week of July, sank two landingbarges off the south coast of the Crimea.Between the 22nd and the 29th, Russian cutters bombarded Taganrogharbour and shelled troops and supplies west of Mervtildkeva.South-West Pacific.8. A Japanese force of one cruiser and three destroyers was intercepted by Allied ships on the night of the 6th/7th in the Vella Gulf apparently making for Vila (Kolombangara Island). The cruiser and two destroyers were sunk&apos; andthe third destroyer was probably sunk.  There were no Allied losses.
US. destroyers, on the night of the 9th/10th, sank two barges in the VellaGulf and probably sank two others.Allied M.T.Bs. sank at least two barges off Munda on the night of the3rd/4th and a small ship off Kolombangara Island on the following night.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. Twenty-six attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week :16 by ships and ten by aircraft. One of the attacks was carried out in theMediterranean.   Flying operations have been restricted by weather.On the night of the 6th/7th, repeated attacks by five U.S. aircraft in the carribbean caused a U-boat to be scuttled : 44 of the crew were picked up. Onthe 8th and 9th, aircraft from the U.S.S. Card (auxiliary carrier) when north-west of the Azores sank one U-boat from which 40 prisoners were taken, and probably damaged another.- A U-boat was probably sunk by the U.S.S. Borie (destroyer)on the 8th in the same area, and one was possibly sunk by aircraft from theU.S.S. Card on the 3rd north-west of the Azores. Two other U-boats were probably danlaged by. U.S. aircraft, one south of Sardinia on the 5th and theother south-west of Bermuda on the 7th.Enemy Intelligence.German.10. The Sekeer, which has probably been equipped with additional anti-aircraft armament, is reported to have sailed from Copenhagen, southbound, onthe 10th.Five E-boats and a number of minesweepers arrived at Copenhagen onthe 5th.Italian.11. The two Cavour class battleships from Taranto have been at sea in theGulf during the week. Two 6&quot; cruisers from Spezia and two others from Genoahave also been sighted in the Tyrrhenian Sea.Photographic reconnaissance of Genoa on the 10th showed a Littorio classbattleship in dry dock.The Littorio is being re-named Italia.Japanese.12. There are indications that the Japanese naval forces in the Bismarck-Solomons area have been reinforced. Reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 2ndshowed two heavy cruisers, a light cruiser and three destroyers as well as 14 cargo ships totalling 64,000 tons, with 276 barges in the anchorage. On the 7th, inaddition, two heavy cruisers and two light cruisers were seen approachingNew Britain from the north.U-boats.13. It is estimated that the number of U-boats now at sea in the atlantic and Indian Oceans has dropped to 65.Two German-built 500-ton U-boats were seen off Danzig in July, flying theItalian flag and manned by Italian crews. This confirms reports that germany is building U-boats for the Italians.With a few notable exceptions, U-boat morale is recently reported to haveshown a marked decline, which is attributed to heavy losses at sea and to the deterioration in home front morale.Enemy Attack on Shipping.14. During the week four ships are reported to have been attacked and sunk by U-boats. .       .One ship, in an eastbound Mediterranean convoy, was sunk off Bone. Theother three ships were sunk off Freetown, east of Madagascar and off Mauritius.Aircraft sank a ship north of Port Darwin (Australia) and again damaged a ship which was being salved at Augusta.15. Shipping losses from enemy action during July, as recorded to date,total 58 ships (351,000 tons), including losses sustained during the Sicilian
operations. U-boats accounted for 44 ships (245,000 tons), of which 26 ships(147,000 tons) were sunk in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. 13 ships(72,000 tons) in the North Atlantic and five ships (26,000 tons) in the Mediter-ranean. Aircraft sank 13 ships (106,000 tons) principally in the Mediterranean,and one ship (7.200 tons) was mined.Marine risks accounted for 21,000 tons, making a total of 372,000 tons for the month of July.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 8th, 973 ships were convoyed. Of these333 ships were in ocean convoys and 640 in British coastal convoys.Seventy-nine destroyers (including 14 U.S. destroyers), 96 sloops, frigates,cutters and corvettes (including one US. cutter), one escort carrier, one oceanboarding vessel and one cruiser were employed on escort duties.Four ocean convoys, consisting of 160 ships, arrived in the United kingdom without loss.17. During the week ending the 7th, imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 1,063,000 tons compared with 754,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 1,082,000 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 278,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.18. In the West Atlantic and Caribbean during July, 170 convoys of1,830 ships reached their destination with the loss of six ships.British Minelaying.19. During the week surface craft laid mines off the Dutch and Belgiancoasts and the Biscay ports. Aircraft laid mines off the Dutch coast and theBiscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.20. There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy surface craft or aircraft during the week.The weather has held up minesweeping during the week, but two mines were destroyed off the south-east coast and one in Lyme Bay. The mine totals are :4,446 ground and 3,045 moored.tEnemy Merchant Shipping.21. The Swedish Government has informed Germany that the transit of personnel and war material through Sweden will no longer be permitted. Thequestion of the transport of oil is still under consideration. It is estimated thatthe alternative sea routes in the Baltic and along the Norwegian coast will entail the continuous use of at least 50,000 tons of shipping, which will have to be taken from other traffic. In addition about 10,000 tons of small fast ships will berequired for routine troop movements along the Norwegian coast.Hamburg had been cleared, by the 1st August, of some 200,000 tons of activeshipping which was in the port at the time of the first heavy air-raid, leavingabout 59,000 tons either damaged, laid up or under repair.The German tanker Nord A atlantic (9,897 tons), which had sailed from Vigoon the 5th, was sighted by aircraft later that day ashore and on fire off cape Villano (NW. Spain) and has since become a-total loss. The ex-Vichytanker Firuz (7,327 tons), which had sailed frOm Constanza on the 5th with a cargo of fuel-oil, reached Istanbul with her bows badly damaged after havingbeen torpedoed in the Black Sea. The ex-Vichy tanker Bacchus (1,810 tons)arrived at Istanbul on the 8th from the iEgean.French Intelligence.22. At Martinique, at the time of Admiral Roberfs capitulation on the13th July, there are stated to have been at Fort de France the aircraft-carrierBeam, the 6&quot; cruiser Emile Bertin, the auxiliary cruiser Barfleur, a convertedminesweeper, a training ship and two naval tankers. The Beam hadbeen beached by order of the local authorities and the Emile Bertin was in dry dock. There were also six tankers of 45,000 tons, of which five were in good condition, and seven cargo ships of 26,000 tons.The 6&quot; cruiser Jeanne d&apos;Arc was at Guadeloupe.
Spanish Intelligence.23. Six destroyers, two submarines and a M.L. arrived at Mar in (north ofVigo) on the 6th from Cadiz.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map of Eastern Sicily is included as an inset.)Sicily.24. After the capture of Catania and Centuripe, the Eighth Army followed up the retreating enemy on either side of Mount Etna. Although the enemy hasbeen forced to withdraw he has made the most of the very difficult country, andhas carried out extensive demolitions in an attempt to slow down the speed of ouradvance. In the coastal district the network of roads and small towns had been cleared by the 8th and the leading troops had passed Acireale. North of thistown enemy resistance stiffened somewhat and progress became more difficult, butby the 11th we had captured Giarre and were in contact with the enemy&apos;sdefensive line running inland from RiposteMeanwhile the road running from Catania to Adrano was cleared andAdrano itself captured on the morning of the 7th. - The left wing of the eighth army pressed on round the western slopes of Mount Etna towards Bronte whichwas captured on the 8th. An extensive use of mines and demolitions has beenmade in this area, and although the fighting spirit of the enemy remains high,there are now signs that he is experiencing difficulty in maintaining supplies ofammunition, a fact which is borne cut by repeated reports of tanks operating asS.P. artillery.25. The Seventh Army after the capture of Troina on the 5th, pushed on toCesaro, which they took on the 8th. Leading troops are now within six miles ofRandazzo and have made contact on their right with the Eighth Army. On thenorth coast United States troops finally took San Fratello early on the morning ofthe 8th. On the same day a battalion of infantry was landed from the sea justnorth of Santa Agata. They got ashore unopposed but subsequently met amotorised column of Germans moving west. After a sharp engagement theenemy was forced to retire eastwards in confusion leaving 1,500 prisoners in our hands. As a result of this successful landing Santa Agata was captured the next day and the advance continued up the coast towards Cape Orlando. Here again the same tactics have been employed, and on the 11th another battalion landed onthe coast just north of the cape and struck inland towards Naso. Infantryadvancing from Santa Agata are reported to have cut the road south of Naso.Progress along the northern coast road has been very difficult and by-passesand dirt tracks have had to be constructed round the many bridges that have been blown by the enemy. Allied naval forces have given effective support to ouradvance along either coast, and our air forces have ceaselessly bombed what fewroads the enemy is still able to use.26. Up to the 4th the estimated number of prisoners taken totalled119.600, of which the Eighth Armv had taken 28,000 and the Seventh Armv91,600.Libya.27. At 2130 on the 3rd an Italian sabotage party was landed from a U-boatabout 15 miles south of Benghazi. They had proposed to re-embark at 0400 thefollowing morning, but they were all captured before reaching their first objective, the airfield at Berca.The Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Leningrad Sector. .   -28. The Germans have constantly reported unsuccessful Russian attackssouth of Lake Ladoga, but it is probable that these have in fact been no more thanextended reconnaissance activity.
Orel Sector.29. The Russian offensive against the Orel salient has made steady progress,with the Germans resisting strongly and making frequent counter-attacks tocover their withdrawals. The capture of Orel by the Russians was announced on the 5th, and Russian troops have now reached a line running roughly north andsouth some 25 miles west of the city.The Germans claim to be making a planned withdrawal in order to shortentheir line, but it is clear that, if this is true, it is a course which has been forced upon them by the Russian attacks. Only very serious considerations would have caused them to abandon Orel, which they clef ended resolutely during the russian offensive last winter.Donets Sector.30. A Russian attack which seems to have taken the Germans by surpriseresulted in the capture of Byelgorod on the 5th. Since then the Russians have advanced rapidly and are now seriously threatening Kharkov. They havereached or crossed the railway Sumy-Kharkov for the greater part of its lengthand have also occupied Lipsi, 12 miles north-east of Kharkov.There are signs that the. recent heavy fighting has weakened the german armoured divisions in this sector, and also that the Germans are suffering from lack of reserves. The suddenness with which the danger to Kharkov has arisen islikely to increase the Germans&apos; difficulties.Mius Sector.31. There has been little activity in this sector apart from local Russianattacks.Tainan Bridgehead.32. The Germans have reported a renewal of Russian attacks against theTainan -bridgehead, but there has been no confirmation of this from the Russians.South-West Pacific Area.New Guinea.33. An Australian attack on the Japanese pocket in the Komiatum area onthe 4th was unsuccessful.Salamaua airfields and isthmus are now under fire from Australian andTJ.S. artillery in the coastal area.Since the 1st August 62 Japanese are reported to have been killed in theBoddubi area four and a half miles south-west of Salamaua.Solomons.34. U.S. troops, after reducing the line of Japanese pillboxes to the east of Munda airfield, succeeded in enveloping it and cutting off the bulk of thegarrison, and by the 6th organised resistance had ceased. In the final stages of the attack on Munda 1,671 Japanese are reported to have been killed and 28prisoners taken, bringing the total estimated Japanese casualties during the campaign up to approximately 3,000 killed. U.S. forces are now closing in onthe Japanese garrison at Bairoko (ten miles north of Munda), which is estimatedat 1,100.  Work on clearing and repairing Munda airfield is already in progress.Intelligence.-India.35. Serious interruptions to communications have occurred in the Calcuttaarea as a result of floods. This will have grave repercussions on the flow ofsupplies over the Assam lines of communication.Burma.36. About 1,000 armed Japanese Indian Fifth Columnists are reported tobe in the area south of Buthidaung.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.37.   Aircraft of Bomber Command made heavy attacks on Mannheim andNuremberg.In Sicily, full support was provided for the land forces.   Heavy attacks weremade on Messina and on rail communications in Southern Italy.United Kingdom.38. In daylight five enemy reconnaissance aircraft flew over the south coast. At night 37 enemy aircraft were reported overland. Of these, on one night, 20 bombers made a sharp attack on Plymouth and 15 bombers and fighter-bombers concentrated on Bournemouth.Coastal Operations.39. Torpedo Hampdens attacked a convoy off the south west of Norway andprobably hit a 2,000 ton ship and an escort vessel.Whirlwind bombers and their Spitfire escort attacked E-boats and other craftin Aber-Vrach harbour (North of Brest); four E-boats and an armed trawler were destroyed and another E-boat was set on fire.Off the French coast, a 1,500 ton tanker was sunk by a Spitfire and a trawlerwas set&apos; on fire by Mosquitoes.Operating at night, Naval Albacores sank three R-boats off Calais and damaged two others.An enemy four-engined aircraft was destroyed by two Lightnings (P.38) offIceland.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 85 were despatched, laid 196 sea-mines in enemy waters; three bombers are missing.On the morning of the 11th, a Mosquito despatched on photographic recon-naissance of targets in Northern Italy landed in North West Africa. In the afternoon, the aircraft took off, photographed targets in Central France; andlanded in this country.&apos; This is the first occasion upon which an aircraft on anoperational flight has flown to North Africa and back in a day.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.40. Operations have been severely restricted by adverse weather and onlyone bombing attack was carried out. This was on the U-boat stores at Rennes, inthe Brest Peninsula, which were bombed from low level by 29 unescorted Bostons(A.20). Bursts were largely concentrated in the main section of the depot andphotographs confirm the attack to have been highly successful. Of the 40 Bostons(A.20) despatched, two were lost and another crashed in this country.An attempted attack on St. Omer/Fort Rouge airfield by escorted Marauders(B.26) had to be abandoned over the target owing to thick cloud. A Marauder(B 26) was lost but the escorting Spitfires, of which three are missing, destroyedseven enemy fighters and probably destroyed another.Fighters, in attacks on transport targets in Northern France and Belgium,damaged 15 locomotives and several goods trains and barges; three aircraft are missing from- these operations.Night.41. Attacks by the &quot; heavies &quot; of Bomber Command, of which 1,110 were despatched, were made on Mannheim and Nuremberg. At the former, 424aircraft dropped 1,684 tons of bombs in favourable weather conditions and reports indicate a good concentration of bombing with some tendency towards the west ofthe city. Over Nuremberg, weather was not favourable and the 590 aircraft which attacked dropped 1,608 tons of bombs through thick cloud. No photographicevidence is yet available to determine the degree of success on the two targets.The 25 aircraft which are missing from these operations and six which crashedin this country or the sea represents a percentage of 2&apos;- 79 to the sorties despatched;six enemy aircraft were destroyed.Small scale attacks were made by Mosquitoes on Duisburg, Cologne, Dussel-&apos;dorf and Mannheim.
Intruder aircraft destroyed two enemy aircraft, attacked a number of air-fields in the Low Countries and Northern France and, in attacks on railways,damaged ten locomotives.North Italy.42. On the night of the 7th/8th, 197 Lancaster? were despatched to attackMilan, Turin and Genoa; 548 tons of bombs were dropped, in approximately equal proportions, on the three targets. Visibility was excellent and at each place a concentrated attack was delivered. Photographs taken later are referred to inAppendix VI.Mediterranean.Sicily.43. A heavy concentration of bombing was made on Messina. In daylightthree raids, each carried out by over 50 Fortresses (B. 17), attacked the docks,railway centre and road junctions with very good results, and released 540 tonsof bombs. At night Wellingtons flew nearly 400 sorties and dropped over 700 tonsbombing the docks and the beaches between Messina and Cape Pelora; hits were reported on barges and M.T. Fighters and fighter-bombers in large numbersattacked shipping in the Straits, at Milazzo and on the beaches; many bargeswere destroyed and Siebel-ferries and other vessels were sunk.The Tactical Air Force made repeated attacks on enemy key positions at Randazzo, Adrano, Biancavilla, Bronte and Troina, and road junctions were heavily bombed and blocked. Light bombers in support of land forces attackedsupply dumps while fighter-bombers attacked road and rail movement. In one day&apos;s operations 140 M.T. vehicles were destroyed or damaged, 20 railway carswere damaged and 10 trucks destroyed.Palermo was attacked by about 30 enemy aircraft on the night 3rd/4th. Asimilar raid was made on Augusta on the 9th/10th, and by about 10 fighter-bombers in daylight on the 9th. Twelve enemy aircraft were shot down, includ-ing five by A.A. guns.The Allied air forces enjoyed almost complete immunity from enemy airinterference over Sicily, and were able to give valuable support to the land forces.-Italy.44. The U-boat base at Naples was attacked by 77 Fortresses (B, 17). Theport power-station was severely damaged, the central railway station half destroyed, the dockside railway was cut in six places, and one liner was sunk,another was burnt out, and a third was listing and probably burnt out. Anattack by 51 Wellingtons was made on the marshalling yards and was reportedto be well concentrated. The Fortresses (B. 17) were intercepted by about 40enemy fighters, three of which were destroyed.Railroad communications on each side of the toe of Italy were heavily attacked. The railway centre and a bridge at Catanzaro was bombed on fouroccasions, and the main line was cut. At Paola many direct hits were reported on the railway centre, the main Naples-Reggio line was cut and a bridge was hit. Marauders (B. 26) twice bombed Angi-otola (W. of Catanzaro) and caused considerable damage to a road and railway bridge and hit the embankment in sixplaces. The railway yards at Battipaglia (40 miles S.E. of Naples) were bombed by 41 Wellingtons.Lightnings (P. 38) carried out a number of offensive reconnaissances andsuccessfully attacked trains, railway tracks, radio installations and a barge.From these operations nine enemy fighters were shot down and six Lightnings(P. 38) are missing.The airfield at Cotrone was bombed by over 70 escorted Mitchells (B. 25) asa result of which the landing ground was rendered unserviceable.Sardinia.45. Four Mitchells (B. 25) escorted by 48 war hawks (P. 40 F) made a low-level attack on the switching station at Guspini (35 miles NW. of Cagliari).Nine rounds of 75-mm. shells were fired from 200 feet and three direct hits were obtained.
Enemy Bomber Activity.46. German long-range bomber activity showed a significant decline andshrank to three night operations, against Palermo, Augusta and Bizerta. Thescale of effort is remarkably small when compared with the long-range bomber force available in the Central Mediterranean, and the failure to keep up sustainedoperations night by night is also noteworthy. - Moreover, although some damage was incurred at Palermo and Augusta, the raid on Bizerta was a complete failureand no damage was reported. The inefficiency of the considerable G.A.F. long-range force in the Mediterranean thus continues to be its most markedcharacteristic.Battle Casualties and Sorties.47. During the week ended the 10th, 44 enemy aircraft were shot down;40 Allied aircraft are missing.   A total of 8,357 sorties was flown.Russia.48. The Russian Air Force have strongly supported their land forcesattacking in the direction of Bryansk and Kharkov. Retreating enemy forces were harassed and attacks were maintained on his lines of supply against road and rail transport. There is no doubt that the Russian Air Force is in superiorstrength at all points of their offensive.At night, railway centres ahead of the Bryansk and Kharkov attacks,including Bryansk, Kharkov and Lyubotin were raided and on three nightsGerman airfields were also attacked. Much damage was done to trains, dumpsand many German aircraft were destroyed.It seems probable that the G.A.F. is suffering from lack of reserves and isbeing compelled to move aircraft at short notice from one sector to another tomeet successive Russian threats.Burma.49.   In the Mandalay total of 25 Mitchells (B. 25) made a numberof small scale attacks on communications and other targets. Apart from the sinking of two ferry boats and a small steamer, no outstanding results are reported. Beaufighters damaged two power-driven boats and about 40 sampansat Pakokku (84 miles S.W. of Mandalay).In the Upper Chindwin, Blenheims and Mohawks made three attacks onKalemyo and one on Mawlaik.In South-West Burma, two Beaufighters damaged 30 railway vehicles and13 river craft between Prome and Tharawaddy.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.50. The main effort has been directed against enemy positions in theSalamaua area which were attacked on five occasions by a total of 106 aircraft,mostly heavy bombers. Bogadyim (near Madang) was bombed twice by a totalof 32 aircraft.Several attacks were made on small craft in the Vitiaz Straits and ITuonGulf; 27 barges were destroyed, two motor-launches set on fire and other craftdamaged.New Britain.51. Mitchells (B. 25) bombed and machine-gunned enemy stores and villagesin the Itne River area and, off the coast, destroyed 14 barges and damaged10 others.NeivIreland.52.   A 1,500-ton ship was sunk by aircraft in the Kavieng area.Amboina Archipelago.53. On Serang Island, Liberators (B. 24) bombed targets in the area ofAmbon and, at night, the airfield at Laha.Medium bombers attacked the landing strip and villages on Selaru island and the village of Doelah near Langgoer in the Kai Islands.
Timor.54.   Night attacks were made on the airfields at Lauten and Penfoei.Solomon Islands.55. On the 4th, escorted medium and light bombers made a final attackon Munda (New Georgia) which was captured by Allied forces two days later.The main air effort was then directed against Bairoko and Vila (KolombangaraIsland). The former was bombed on two occasions by a total of 86 escortedbombers and the latter on four occasions by 109 aircraft.In combats over Rendova Island, Allied fighters, of which three are missing,destroyed 16 enemy aircraft; a further three enemy aircraft were destroyed byA.A. fire. -In the Shortland Island area, Allied fighters destroyed seven float-planeson the water, four small craft and, in combat, seven enemy fighters.Enemy positions at Rekata Bay on Ysabel Island were subjected to two attacks by 96 Allied bombers.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.56. No incidents occurred during the early part of the period under review.On the night of the 10th/11th some bombs were dropped on R.A.F. property atFeltwell (Norfolk). On the morning of the 11th shells fired from the french coast fell in Dover and.St. Margarets at Cliffe, causing some damage to house property. On the night 11th/ 12th a sharp attack was made on Plymouth, andsome 45 fires were started, including one at the Royal William Victualling Yard.A gas holder at the St. Kevans Road gasworks and a ward at the City Hospitalwere burnt out. Considerable damage was done to house property, but utilityservices.were not seriously affected. Casualties so far reported are. 34 killed and78 seriously injured.A short attack was also made on Bournemouth on the same night wdiereseveral houses were demolished. Casualties reported are 11 killed and 15 seriously injured.Casualties.57. There were no civilian casualties during the week ending 0600 onthe 11th.

APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the weekGermany.Cologne. A final interpretation of photographs now shows that as a resultof the three attacks on the 28th/29th June, 3rd/4th July and the 8th/9th July,over 75 per cent, of the fully built-up districts has been destroyed, while in thecentral city area destruction amounts to 83 per cent.On the East bank of the Rhine three factories, rated priority 1 -I-, have been damaged, two of them very severely. The Humboldt-Deutz Motor en A.G.(internal combustion engines) at Kalk has been more than three-quartersdestroyed, and a branch at Deutz has serious damage to the main workshops.Of the 35 workshops and buildings of Gottfried Hagen A.G. (submarine batteries)20 have been destroyed and most of the others damaged. In Felton &amp; GuillaumeCarlswerk (cables) six workshops have been damaged. In addition, 12 other industrial firms on the East bank have been damaged, most of them severely, aswell as 20 small unidentified factories.On the West bank, damage to marshalling yards, goods depots and railwayproperty generally is outstanding, and it is estimated that over 1,000 wagons and300 coaches have been destroyed or damaged. There-is extensive damage towarehouses and storage sheds in the river harbours at Deutz and Mullheim andin addition to industrial damage on the West bank already reported, several other factories are now seen to have been damaged, including a cable works, a factory for shell fuses, three machinery firms and an aluminium foundry.Mannheim. The passenger and goods stations were heavily damaged in the attack on the 9th/10th August and were still burning at 10 o&apos;clock the following morning. The railway authorities at Basle were requested to send all availablepassenger coaches for evacuation purposes. No trains routed via Mannheimarrived at Basle on the morning of the 10th and instructions were given to routeno traffic to the West through Mannheim.Hamburg. Swedish ships have been forbidden by the German authorities toenter the port and the majority have been diverted to Bremen. German ships and coal traffic by rail formerly using Hamburg have also been diverted .toBremen which is reported to be congested.Casualties to H.M. Auxiliary Vessels and to Naval Personnel.1st August. M.T.B. 657 and M.T.B. 660 slightly damaged in action offMessina.3rd/4th August. M.G.B. 604 and M.G.B. 605 damaged in action off dutch coast.

W arnemunde. A further interpretation of photographs taken after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 29th July shows that out. of 27 buildings in the Aradoaircraft factory, 18 have&apos;been hit, five of them being.destroyed or nearly so, and seven very severely damaged. At least eight unidentified warehouses and other buildings north of the factory have been partially destroyed, as well as docksidestores and commercial buildings west of the railway station.Munich. During the Mosquito attack on the 15th/16th July, considerable damage was caused to railway sidings which took three days to repair.France.Villacoublay. &quot;It is reported that the U.S.A.A.F. attack was very successful.A large number of aircraft, including many F.W. 190 which were burnt out, anda considerable quantity of spares were destroyed. Some experienced Germanmechanics and technicians who were killed during the raid have not yet been replaced.Norway.Heroya. A final interpretation of photographs taken on the 25th July afterthe U.S.A.A.F. daylight attack on the 24th July shows that all four plants ofthe A/S Nordisk Lettmetal were severely damaged. The producer gas plant, therectifier station, the power station, the new transformer station and the nitricacid absorption towers, all of which are vital to the operation of the works, havebeen damaged.In the magnesium works area ten out of 23 buildings concerned with plantoperations and about six workshops and offices have been affected.In the aluminium works are three of six plant buildings which have been damaged and two stores buildings, offices and about 20 small sheds have been destroyed.In the alumina works area all four processing buildings have been damaged,and in the nitrate works area about 20 buildings and installations out of some 45used in the processing or storing of nitrates as well as eight other stores and workshops have been destroyed or damaged.An armed coaster (about 200 ft.) at the quayside in the nitrate works area has been sunk.Some bombs fell on Roligheten Island immediately to the north of Heroyaand damaged the Synthetic Cryolite plant and some other installations.Trondheim. &quot;It now appears that in addition to one U-Boat and a cargo ship, a medium sized tanker and two tugs were also sunk in the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 24th July. In addition a destroyer and several smaller vessels were damaged, also a large floating crane.Casualties among German naval personnel were severe.Holland.A msterdam. Photographs taken after the daylight attack on the 25th july show that the Fokker aircraft factory has been severely damaged. Amongstbuildings destroyed are a tool shop, an assembly shop and a shed containing theanodising department. The glider wings construction and wood working building is almost entirely destroyed.A long shed connected with the Noord II electricity power station has alsobeen destroyed.Italy.Naples. Photographs taken after two daylight attacks on the 15th and17th July, and a night attack on the 14th/ 15th July, show very heavy damagethroughout the marshalling yards and Central Station, the industrial areas Northand South of the railway, and the fuel installations east of the marshalling yards. In the Central Station itself, six of eight departure platforms are severely damaged and at least six trains alongside hit. Goods sheds, rolling-stock andtracks in the station area are also heavily affected.  The tracks between the station
and the marshalling yards have been repeatedly hit. Important industrial targets heavily damaged include : Royal Arsenal.Stores Depot adjacent to Arsenal.Breda locomotive works.Imam airframe works.Manifatture Cotoniere Meridionale (Textile Works) (both sections severely damaged).Torpedo factory.Siap oil storage.Raffineria di Napoli (Oil refinery).Oleificio Liguori (Oil works).Main Factory Industriale Meccaniche E Aeronautiche.   (All chief buildingsnow severely damaged.)Chemical Works S.E. of Marshalling Yards.A.G.I.P. oil storage.Oil storage tanks N.E. of submarine base.At least 7 unidentified factories and other industrial buildings.&apos; An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 10th August afterthe attacks on 7th / 8th August on Genoa, Milan and Turin show that in :Genoa. Damage mainly due to fire is scattered throughout the town anddocks within a radius of 1\ miles of the Duomo. Several large port buildings,more than 60 of the large business and residential blocks characteristic of Italiancities, and a number of public buildings have been damaged. Both the main railway station and the Brignole Station have again suffered.Milan. The damage which has been caused chiefly by incendiaries is all near the centre of the town. Commercial and residential buildings have been hit, and among the more important items of damage are : The Main Railway Station.The Northern Line Goods Station (goods sheds damaged).The Scalo Ferini Goods Station (customs sheds damaged).The Innocenti &quot;Works.The Pirelli Works (by H.E.).Turin. Most of the damage has occurred between the Rivers Po and Dora&apos;and the State Railway Workshops, the Stazione di Porta Nuova, and the station in Corso Giulio have all suffered.   The Royal Arsenal has again been damaged and business and residential property in the centre of the town has been affected.Rumania.Ploesti. The attack on the 1st August was very successful. 65 per cent, ofthe total refinery capacity was put out of action.Sea-mining.On one or two occasions in the last week of July mines have exploded in the sound, area, and there have been a number of minesweepers and aircraft employedin sweeping. The German authorities are very uneasy about these explosionshaving regard to the length of time that has elapsed since sea-mining took placein this area and their belief that it had been cleared.
