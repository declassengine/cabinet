ITALY.At 1730 on the 8th Allied Headquarters announced that the ItalianGovernment had surrendered its forces unconditionally.NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Strong Allied naval forces have supported landings on the mainland ofItaly.The three Littorio class battleships, with six cruisers and many destroyers,have been sighted off northern Sardinia steering to the S.W.The Tirpitz and Scharnhorst have left Altenfiord.One ship has been torpedoed by U-boat and two others damaged by mineduring the week.Shipping casualties during August were the lowest since November 1941.A Japanese U-boat has been sunk, one U-boat has been probably sunk andthree possibly damaged.Northern Waters.2. The Spitsbergen wireless telegraphy station, which is manned byNorwegians, reported at 0145/8 the approach of ten enemy warships. Since thattime all attempts to communicate with the station have failed.Home Waters.3. Four S.G.Bs., on the night of the 4th/5th, engaged seven enemy mine-sweepers and some tank landing craft wdiich were proceeding down Channel fromBoulogne. One T.L.C. was torpedoed and two others seriously damaged by gunfire. All our craft received damage and there were 12 casualties. On the night of the 7th/8th, three M.T.Bs. attacked three T.L.Cs. and two A&apos;/Atrawders which were off Fecamp steering east.

An.M.T.B. was slightly damaged and sustained three casualties.H.M. destroyers Limbourne and Goathland engaged E-boats, on the night ofthe 2nd/3rd, off Guernsey. One E-boat was possibly sunk and another damaged,Naval Albacores had previously damaged a third off Start Point.4. Dover coastal batteries shelled two ships east of Calais on the night ofthe 3rd/4th, setting one of them on fire.  Enemy batteries replied.On four occasions during the week enemy coastal batteries shelled our mine-sweeping flotillas and coastal forces in the Channel. On the 1st, H.M.S. Hydra(minesweeper) and an M.G.B. were damaged without casualties and, on the 7th,H.M.S. Qualicum (minesweeper) was slightly damaged and had five casualties.North Atlantic.5. The French cruiser Montcalm intercepted the Spanish s.s. Monte Albertia(2,955 tons) which was bound from Buenos Aires to Bilboa carrying un-navicertedgoods and sent her into port.H.M. trawler Scottish, while on escort duty, shot down one of threeF.W. 200s which made an attack off Cape St. Vincent on the 2nd.Mediterranean,6. H.M. ships Warspite arid Valiant carried out a bombardment south ofReggio on the 2nd. Early the following morning H.M. cruisers, monitors,destroyers, gunboats, with a Polish destroyer, provided cover and support for a landing in the Reggio area. Twenty-two tank landing ships and 274 landing craft of various types were used in the operations. Subsequently day and nightpatrols were maintained off the coast of Calabria without incident. On the 5th,cruisers and destroyers operated south of the Strait of Messina and H.M.S.Quilliam (destroyer) passed through the Strait and provided support for thenorthern flank of the Eighth Army during the day. On the 8th, a brigade waslanded at Vibo Valentia in the face of some opposition; one M.T.B. was sunk and a tank landing ship and two tank landing craft were damaged.
Early on the 9th, landings in the Gulf of Salerno were covered by strongAllied naval forces, which included H.M. ships Nelson, Rodney, Wan-spite andValiant, H.M. aircraft-carriers Formidable and Illustrious and three U.S.cruisers.Reggio harbour was reported clear of underwater obstructions on the 5th.At San Giovanni, the landward approaches to the harbour were blocked butthe outer breakwater is intact.7. The following attacks have been reported by H.M. submarines:Unruffled, on the 27th sank a 4,000-ton ship in the southern Adriatic. Sickle,on the 28th, sank a 3,000-ton armed ship off the east coast of Corsica.

U.S. submarines operating in the Pacific and Far Eastern waters have sunk six ships, including a tanker, and have damaged four others.New Britain.11. Incomplete photographs of Rabaul on the 3rd shows 14 ships, totalling66,000 tons  Three of the ships were loaded with barges.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Fifteen attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week : nineby aircraft and six by surface craft. One of the attacks was made in theMediterranean.The U.S.S. Gillette (destroyer) sank a Japanese U-boat on the 2nd in theNew Hebrides. H.M. S/M Shakespeare probably sank a U-boat on the 7th offNaples. Three U-boats were possibly damaged: one west of the Bay of Biscayby a sloop, another in the Azores area by a U.S. destroyer and a third in the bay of Biscay by a Wellington aircraft.Enemy Intelligence.German.13. Air reconnaissance on the 7th showed that the Tirpitz and Scharnhorsthad left Altenfiord.There has recently been considerable movement of destroyers in and out ofnorthern French ports.Photographic reconnaissance of Havre shows the arrival from Rouen sincethe 30th of a ship, 350-feet long, from which funnel, masts and guns have been removed and which appears to be intended for use as a blockship. It is reportedthat invasion barges which have arrived in large numbers at French channel and Mediterranean ports are also intended for blockship purposes. At least,000 barges have been requisitioned in the Low Cou^tries^^*!***Bi5&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Heavily armed tank landing craft have lately been used in the Channel forpatrolling and slow escort duty.Italian.14. A large force, comprising three battleships, six cruisers and aconsiderable number of destroyers, was seen by aircraft to have left Spezia andGenoa on the 9th. After entering the Strait of Bonifacio they turned and were then seen to be steering to the S.S.W.. One battleship of the Littorio class isstated to have been heavily dive-bombed by German aircraft.Air reconnaissance of Taranto early on the 9th showed two battleships andthree cruisers in the outer harbour; one cruiser was later reported to have left.[26057] b
ZJ-boats.15. The number of U-boats at sea, though still moderate, is on the increase.Up to 25 are believed to be now outward bound from the Bay of Biscay. Thereare indications that activity is likely to be resumed in several areas in thenear future.It is reported that an increasing number of U-boats of all types are to have their forward guns removed and their after guns replaced by quadruple 20-mm.or other light anti-aircraft guns.Enemy Attack on Shipping.16. During the week one attack by U-boat has been reported : a U.S. ship was torpedoed south-west of Ceylon.Two ships in convoy were mined off Malta but both reached port.17. Shipping losses from enemy action during August, as recorded to date,total 21 ships (118,000 tons), which is the lowest figure since November 1941.U-boats accounted for 13 ships (86,000 tons), of which nine ships (62,000 tons)were sunk in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic, three ships (20,000 tons) inthe Mediterranean and one ship (4,000 tons) in the North Atlantic. Aircraftsank five ships (21.000 tons), chiefly in the Mediterranean and off the coast ofPortugal.   Two ships were sunk by mine.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 5th, 796 ships were convoyed. Of these,249 ships were in ocean convoys and 547 in British coastal convoys. Sixty-three destroyers (including 13 U.S. destroyers and one French), 103 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including two French sloops and four U.S. cutters) one anti-aircraftship and one French armed merchant cruiser were employed on Escort duties.. * Three, peean convoys, consisting of 127 ships, arrived in Home waters without loss.19. During the week ending the 4th, imports into the United kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 1,297,000 tons, compared with 1,316,000 tons duringthe previous seven days and an average of 1,036,000 tons during the past ten weeks.  Of the week&apos;s imports, 429,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.20. During August, 15 homebound ocean convoys, of 571 ships, and 13outward-bound convoys, of 471 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Two outward-bound convoys, originally of 131 ships, lost three before arrival. -In the West Atlantic and Caribbean, 179 convoys, of 1,795 ships, reached their destinations without loss, and two convoys, orginally 47 ships, lost two before arrival.British Minelaying.21. During the week surface craft laid mines south of Iceland (C) and offthe Dutch and French coasts and the Channel Islands.Aircraft laid mines off the Norwegian coast, in the Baltic, off the frisian islands and the Dutch coast and off the Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.22. E-boats are thought to have been minelaying on one night of the week in Lyme Bay and in the Strait of Dover. Aircraft may have laid mines on two nights, in the Strait of Dover and the Channel.Seven mines have been destroyed east and south-east of Dungeness. the mine totals, including belated reports of. minesweeping from Malta and in theTripoli area, are : 4,453 ground and 3,103 moored.Dangerous areas have been declared in the Gulf of Salerno and also betweenCape Spartivento and the Gulf of Taranto.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. During the period the 1st to 15th August, ten enemy ships, totalling58,579 tons, have been sunk and two ships, totalling 10,000&apos;tons, have been seriously damaged. Six, totalling 42,698 tons, were sunk in the mediterranean and the two damaged ships were also in the Mediterranean.
24. A marked recovery in trade is stated to have occurred at Hamburg,A partial reconnaissance of the port on the 18th showed some 75,000 tons of active shipping present and it is reported that, by the 24th. shipping activityhad reached 55 per cent, of its total before the bombing.The German hospital ship Strasbourg, ex-Dutch Baloeran (17,000 tons) was.seen by air reconnaissance on the 3rd and 8th to be aground off Ijmuiden.The German tanker Nord A atlantic (9,897 tons) which recently grounded off cape Villano, was refloated on the 25th, and is now at Corunna ready to sail.MILITARY SITUATION.Italy.(An outline map of Southern Italy is included as an inset.)25. Early on the morning of the 3rd September General Eisenhower gave the order for the war to be carried on to the mainland of Italy. Previous to theactual assault, which was directed against the south-west coast of Calabria,successful reconnaissance landings had been made by Commandos. The assaultwas carried out by British and Canadian troops of the Eighth Army who hadbeen withdrawn from the fighting in Sicily shortly before the end of the campaign,in order to prepare for the landing on the Toe of Italy.Under cover of a strong naval force, continuous air protection and a heavy artillery barrage across the Strait of Messina, the leading brigades sailed totheir landing beaches between Catona and St. Gallico and at Reggio withoutenemy interference. Disembarkation of troops and stores proceeded accordingto plan. Enemy opposition was negligible and only one of the coastal guns firedon our troops.26. Reggio was captured by the Canadians on the day of the assault, andthe airfield outside the town was also occupied. Practically no demolitions&apos;had.been carried out on the airfield or at Reggio where the communication services were found to be in working order, and the harbour was quickly prepared toreceive our shipping] From Reggio the Canadians advanced in two directions,north-eastwards through San Stefano to Delianuova which they occupied, on the6th and southwards along the coast road to Bova Marina. At the same time theystruck inland through the mountains and reached Roccaforte on the 6th. news of their progress has been scanty, but the latest reports state that they have made further progress up the east coast of Calabria and have now reached Locri.Meanwhile the British troops, who had landed north of Reggio. pushed upthe coast, captured Scilla, and made contact with a Commando which had landed at Bagnara. The advance continued northwards to Palmi which was taken onthe 6th. Next day forward troops pushed on to Gioia and met with some enemyopposition outside the town where the bridge over the River Petrace had been blown. On the night of the 7th/8th, another brigade group of the Eighth Army-made a successful landing on the coast just south, of Pizzo in the Gulf of Eufemia.No further details of this landing have yet been received, but it is reported thatthe brigade, is in contact with the enemy rearguard.27. Italian resistance to our landing was negligible, and so far 3,000prisoners have been taken. The local&apos; population is friendly. No reports of our troops having met German forces have so far been received. The Germans intheir northward withdrawal appear to be fighting a delaying action not so muchby fire as by means of demolitions, which have been extensive, and which haveslowed down the rate of our advance.28. Meanwhile following upon the announcement by General Eisenhower onthe evening of the 8th of the unconditional surrender of the Italian armed forces,a new large-scale landing was made in the early hours of the 9th in the Gulf ofSalerno, south of Naples. This operation, covered by very powerful naval forces,was undertaken by. the American Fifth Army, under the command of GeneralMark Clark, comprising a British and U.S. Corps. Apart from the fact that the approach to the landing beaches proceeded according to plan, at the time of&quot;writing no further news has been received as to the progress of the operation.[260571 &apos; b 2
The Russo-German Campaign.Smolensk Sector.29. Since the big advance reported in last week&apos;s Resume there has been little further Russian progress in this sector. The approaches to Smolensk areheavily defended, and the Russian forces are engaged in slowly overcomingcarefully prepared German positions. Mevertheiess, some further ground hasbeen gained, and the Russians have now reached the Dnieper, 25 miles east ofSmolensk.Bryansk-Sumy Sector.30. In the immediate neighbourhood of Bryansk no change of importancehas been reported. To the south, however, a Russian thrust westwards has developed over a much wider front and made rapid progress.The northern flank of this advance has now reached Navlya, a railway junction 30 miles south of Bryansk. A considerable part of the railway from there southwards to Konotop is in Russian hands. Konotop itself was capturedon the 6th, and from there the Russians have pushed westwards and reached therailway Gomel-Kremenschug at a point 22 miles west of Konotop.On the southern flank, Sumy has been taken and the Russians have advanced25 miles west of the town.In the course of little more than a week&apos;s fighting, therefore, the russians have made a considerable advance on a frontage of almost 150 miles, and at one point are some 80 miles west of their positions on the 30th June. In this sector the Russians are now at the most westerly point since the spring of 1942.Kharkov Sector.31. There has been little change in the position in this sector, but theRussians have made a slight advance and captured the railway junction ofMerefa, 15 miles south-south-west of Kharkov.Donetz-Mius Sector.32. The Russian advance south-west of Kuibyshevo has been followed byrapid progress further north. Gorlovka was captured on the 4th, Slavyansk,Kramatorsk and Maketevka on the 6th, and Stalino on the 8th.Summary.33. The Russians have continued to make good progress in their mainthrusts and there is no sign that their attacks are losing their momentum.Indeed, their advances in the Konotop area and in the extreme south have beenvery rapid. Reports from Russia suggest that the fighting quality of the german troops is declining somewhat.South-West Pacific Area.New Guinea.34. In the Saiamaua area there has been some advance in all sectors andthe Australians have &quot;succeeded in reinforcing their forces overlooking Saiamauaairfield. -On the 4th, operations were started against Dae. Australian forces landed in strength at the mouths of the Bulu and Buso Rivers, on the north shore of theHuon Gulf about 15 miles east of Lae. Practically no ground resistance was encountered at first, and they advanced rapidly along the road to Lae as far asMusomb and Ago track junctions eight and ten miles from Lae. They are also reported to be ten miles inland.At the same time a TJ.S. parachute force was dropped on Nadzab (vide &quot; air situation&quot;), and are reported to have joined forces with an Australian unit whichadvanced from the south to meet them. Some Australian artillery is also reported in this area,Solomons.35. There has been little ground activity during the last week. TJ.S. troops are extending their hold on Vella Lavella, where they are in touch with a smallJapanese force on the north-west coast of the Island.
The Japanese have evacuated the island of Isabel, where they formerlymaintained a garrison of about 2,000, and a seaplane base at Rekata Bay. It isreported, but not confirmed, that they have also withdrawn from the island ofChoiseul.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. At night, Mannheim, Munich, Berlin and Boulogne were subjected toaccurate and concentrated attacks. By day, a sustained and heavy effort was directed against railway centres, airfields and ammunition dumps in Trance.In Italy, Allied fighters covered the landings of our forces and bombersmaintained a heavy offensive against communications and airfields.United Kingdom.37. In daylight on the 8th, nine enemy aircraft carried out reconnaissancesover the South-West coast. At night, a total of 32 enemy aircraft operated overthe East and South-East Coasts or just off shore. A further 30 laid mines inthe Channel.   Five were destroyed.Home Waters.38. Typhoons, operating off the Dutch coast, destroyed a 1,000-ton ship and two small vessels, a large barge and a dredger; they damaged five small ships,11 barges and three tugs. Naval Albacores, in night attacks, destroyed two -boats and damaged four others in the Strait of Dover. Escorted Liberators(B. 24) attacked a convojr off Texel.A total of 604 sea-mines was laid in enemy waters by 169 aircraft of bomber command.Nine aircraft of Coastal Command are missing from anti-U-boat operations in the Bay of Biscay and another crashed in the sea.   One Ju. 88 was destroyed.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.39. A total of 1,484 sorties was flown by Fortresses (B. 17) of the U.S.VIII Bomber Command. Automobile and aircraft plants at Romilly,* Meulan,Paris* and Brussels, and airfields in France, including St. Andre de l&apos;Eure,* were attacked by 368 aircraft, which dropped 1,090 tons of bombs with resultsdescribed generally as &quot; fair to good.&quot; Twenty aircraft attacked Stuttgart,while 256, detailed to the same target, having encountered bad weather, releasedtheir bombs on various targets of opportunity in Germany. An objective nearSt. Omer was raided by 58 Fortresses (B. 17). 281 tons of bombs were dropped.Provisional enemy casualties were 111 fighters destroyed, 36 probably destroyed and 43 damaged. Fifty-three Fortresses (B. 17) were lost, of which 12 came downin the Channel; 118 of their personnel were saved by the Air/Sea Rescue Service.Throughout the week escorted light and medium4 bombers operated on an intensive scale. On the 8th a total of 1,516 offensive sorties was flown 1,305 by aircraft of Fighter Command and the Tactical Air Force (a record number ofsorties, apart from the Dieppe operations in August 1942), 95 by U.S. Thunder-bolts (P. 47) and 216 by U.S. Marauders (B. 26). On other days^a slightly lowerbut comparable effort was maintained. Marauders (B. 26) alone dropped a totalof 1,155 tons of bombs during the week, while Mitchells (B. 25), Venturas (B. 34)and Typhoons were also very active.The following were the principal targets, some of which were attacked morethan once : (a) Railway centres at Amiens, Rouen, Abbeville, Lille,* Courtrai,Serqueux, St. Pol, St. Omer, Hazebrouck* and Ghent*; (b) Airfields at Dunkirk /Mardyck, Denain/Prouvy, Lille/Nord, Beauvais/Tille, Beaumont-le-Roger;Woensdrecht, Poix and Vitry-en-Artois; (c) Ammunition dumps in the Foretsde Hesdin and d Jiperlecques; (d) the harbour and defence positions at Boulogne;(e) R.P.

* ....Night.40. The heaviest operation of the week was carried out on the 5th/6th against Mannheim by 512 heavy bombers. Weather was clear, themarkers were accurately placed and an attack developed which is considered tohave been most successful; 1,463 tons of bombs were dropped (vide Appendix VI).Munich was bombed by 347 aircraft on the 6th/7th, when 1,011 tons were released. Two large, well-concentrated areas of fire were seen and many scattered,smaller fires.Lancasters, despatched to Berlin on the 3rd/4th, flew in thick cloud untilover the target, when a fortunate break to clear sky enabled the pathfinders togroup their markers well. A concentrated attack was delivered in 28 minutes,during which time 273 aircraft dropped 906 tons (vide Appendix VI).A total of 234 heavy bombers,1 which included five Fortresses (B. 17), effec-tively attacked objectives in the Boulogne area; about 680 tons were dropped inbright moonlight, which enabled some crews to distinguish ground detail.On each of two nights approximately 75 tons of bombs were dropped insuccessful attacks on targets in the Forets de Mormal and cle Raismes (10 miles.E. and 4 miles N.N.W. respectively of Valenciennes).Seventy-one bombers were lost on the above operations, representing just over4 per cent, of the total number despatched. Fourteen enemy night-fighters were destroyed. *Mosquitoes made small-scale raids on Cologne, Duisburg and dusseldorf. Atotal of 124 &quot; intruder &quot; sorties was flown against airfields and railway targets in Germany, France, Belgium, Holland and Denmark; two enemy aircraft were destroyed.Italy.41. A considerable scale of attack was maintained by Allied bombers on the foot of Italy, immediately prior to and after the landing of our troops on the 3rd.Escorts for the bombers and &quot;cover for our landing craft and naval units were provided by Allied fighters, which maintained complete air superiority over thearea. Gun positions were bombed at Reggio, San Stefano, Scilia, Gioiosa andRosarno. In this southern area, road and rail communications were heavily attacked over a wide area, some of the most concentrated bombing being made atCosenza, Cotrone, Catanzaro, Pizzo, Tropea Cetraro and Trebisacce. Furtherconcentrated attacks were made on troops, defences, headquarters, bivouac areas and radio location stations.Railway communications in the Naples area were heavily bombed. at night, Wellingtons dropped a total of 323 tons of bombs on the railway centresat A versa, Salerno, Villa Literno and Battipaglia; a further attack on this lasttarget was made by Bostons (A. 20). One Wellington is missing from these operations.

On the 4th, in the Augusta area,Spitfires intercepted 21 enemy fighter-bombers, destroying seven, and forcingthe remainder to jettison their bombs. A further 10 enemy aircraft, mostlyflying singly, were destroyed.Russia.45. The Soviet Air Force has been actively supporting offensive operations over the whole front,There has been considerable air activity in the Smolensk direction where,in addition to the close support operations by day, German forces and equipmenthave been heavily raided on three nights of the week.Troop concentrations west of Sumi have been attacked on two nights, and railway objectives at and around Konotop, including Vorozhba, Nezhin andBakmach have also been raided.In the Don basin, where the Russians have made considerable advances, inaddition to effective close support activities, German airfields have been attacked by day. and railway junctions in the Stalino area by night.     &apos; .There has been no new information on GAP. operations&apos; in Russia duringthe past wreek and no withdrawals or reinforcements have been reported. It isbelieved that G.A.F. operations continue to be concentrated in the main on theStalino front, where the situation is most fluid and stiffening by the air forcemost needed; the bulk of L.R. bombers and dive-bombers are probably operating in this area.Burma.46. Fighters, in attacks on river targets on the Mayu, Irrawaddy andChindwin, set fire to two steamers, probably sank four motor boats and an. oilbarge and destroyed or damaged more than 300 small craft.

APPENDIX VI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Germany.Berlin, An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the6th September, discloses damage extending from the north-west to the south ofthe city. Industrial damage is particularly noteworthy and several plants ofthe highest importance are concerned. Damage to residential, commercial andother property is wide-spread and, although there is no vast area of devastationin the parts covered by the photographs, nevertheless it is known from groundsources that a large part of the south-west of the city (which has not been covered)has been severely damaged. Many hutted camps (reported by ground sources tohave been erected for housing evacuees) have been damaged. The followingindustrial damage (in almost every case very severe) has up to the present been identified in addition to that previously reported : Siemensstadt  -Siemens and Halske A.G. (electrical apparatus).Charlottenburg A.E.G. Turbines, &amp;c.Charlottenburg Gas Works.Ges. fur Elektrische Unternehumgen.Ford Auto Dienst.Bamag-Meguin.Dr. Cassirer and Co., A.G.

Mannheim. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the7th September (two days after the attack) is hampered by smoke from fires still burning on the west bank of the Rhine which obscure almost the whole of thebuilt-up area of Ludwigshafen. The east bank was still obscured by a thinningsmoke but it can be seen that there is considerable business and residential damage and the main railway station buildings are gutted. Damage to dockside buildings in the Mulhau Hafen and Industrie Hafen is considerable and many warehouseson the river wharves have also been gutted. It can be seen that further damage has been caused to the I.G. Farben chemical works at Oppau.munchen Gladbach and Rheydt. An immediate interpretation of photo-graphs taken after the attack on the 30th-31st August shows heavy concentrations of damage in the south-east districts of Munchen Gladbach and over the greaterpart of Rheydt. In both places industrial damage is particularly severe. Thereis an area of devastation to the south-west of the centre of Munchen Gladbachand north-east of Rheydt a considerable area of business and residential propertyhas been almost entirely destroyed.France.Paris. Photographs taken on the 4th September after the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the 3rd September show damage to the carriage making shop and slight damage to the steel works and chemical and photographic products shop of theCaudron Renault Works. Three large sheds of the Dunlop Plastic and CelluloidWorks have been severely damaged and five smaller buildings of the same concerndestroyed. Hits on the railway tracks between the airfield and the River Seinehave cut the lines in six places.Lille. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the6th September after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 4th September showsconsiderable damage in La Delivrance marshalling yards. There is a concentra-tion of about 40 craters in the reception sidings, where many wagons have been destroyed or severely damaged, and chaos has been caused. In the sorting sidings,where there are more than 30 craters, about 40 wagons have been destroyed orseverely damaged, and there are a further 13 craters leading to the engine sheds.The through line from Arras to Calais shows at least 15 craters and more damage to wagons.Romilly-sur-Seine. An immediate interpretation of photographs takenfollowing the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 3rd September shows that a pair ofhangars on the south-east side of the airfield has been destroyed and on the north-east side a single hangar has been damaged and a large workshop almost com-pletely destroyed. At least five aircraft near the hangars south-east of the airfield have been severely damaged.A miens I Glisy.

The loco-motive depot shops and the passenger station have been slightly damaged anda shop near the station half gutted.
Caen/Carpiquet.-Photographs taken on the 6th September after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 26th August show that one large hangar was damaged by two or three hits, and a covered shelter severely damaged. In addition to about60 craters on the landing field, there are two on the runway and 15 on taxi-tracksleading to hangars and shelters.Occupied Belgium.Ghent.-An interpretation of photographs taken on the 7th September afterthe U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 5th September shows about 15 hits across the tracksin -the south-east marshalling yard.
