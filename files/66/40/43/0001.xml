THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.SECRET.W.P, (43) 393.10th September, 1943INDIAN FOOD SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet the attached extracts from the Weekly Intelligence Summary from General Headquarters, India, datedthe 20th August, which has recently been received. In view of the recent decisionof the War Cabinet regarding Shipment of Food-stuffs to India (WM. (43)111th Conclusions) I feel that the War Cabinet should be aware of this report.L. S. A.India Office, 10th September, 1943.sjfc5. A special report on conditions in East Bengal and Assam indicates thatfamine conditions are now rife in those districts. In Chittagong, A.R.P.personnel have had to take over the daily removal of corpses from streets and houses. In Dacca, the poor are -living on what rice water they can get, since eventhe rich are unable to obtain rice. Cholera, smallpox and starvation are causinghundreds of deaths daily in the surrounding villages. Similar conditions prevailover a large area of East Bengal, and have given rise to a wide-spread incidence of thefts and dacoities.   Suicides and child-selling have been reported.6. Such conditions, though at their worst in these districts, are not confined to the North-East. A British resident on an estate in Mysore writes that it is dangerous to walk through the estate now as they are having trouble over food.Thousands of Indian workers are starving, and in planting districts in Coorgcoolies die by the wayside of starvation. At a time when Government are urging the estates to increase their output of rubber, many estates in Travancore havehad to stop working owing to supplies of rice being insufficient to feed their labour.7. In the Calcutta area there have been numerous strikes in mills and factories and, though the majority of these strikes have been short lived, the cumulative effect on war production has been considerable. Workers&apos; demands in all cases have centred round the supply of food grains at reasonable prices,and when this demand has been met the situation has rapidly returned to normal.On existing evidence it appears that the strikers are influenced by purelyeconomic and not political motives.*      *      *9. Axis Radio. The following extract is taken from the Azad Hind newsin Tamil for the 14th August, relayed from Germany : &quot; It is reported that the Indian Independence League at Bangkok hasdecided to enlist the help of Japan, Thailand and Burma to export rice toIndia and thus improve the food situation. Though it is normally impossibleto send rice to India from Japanese-occupied territory, the league is preparedto do so if the British Government approves the proposal and gives an.

undertaking that the food so sent will not be reserved for military consump-tion or exported from India. This gesture of the league is expressive ofthe sympathy of Indians in East Asia and their desire to relieve the sufferingof their Indian brethren. If the British do not accept this generous offerthey will be betraying their true intentions/&apos;* *   &apos; *        *15.....Elsewhere in the summary reference is made to Axis broad-casts, purporting to offer rice from Japanese-occupied territories to starvingIndia; every anti-Allied and disruptive agency may be expected similarly to exploit India&apos;s food difficulties to the utmost. In this connection, a formationreport from Chittagong states that men (both British and Indian) are so affectedby the sights they see around them, that they are feeding beggars with their ownrations, even though they are disobeying orders by so doing. The general feelingamongst Indian troops is that immediate assistance must be given to the peopleof Chittagong, and that the Sirkar has already failed in its duty.
