THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.Copy No.AN EXPANSIONIST ECONOMY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.-   &quot; The common problem, yours, mine, everyone&apos;sIs not to fancy what were fair in life,Provided it could be, but, finding firstWhat may be, than find how to make it fairUp to our means-a very different thing ! &quot;The favourite catch phrase of the hour is &quot;an expansionist economy.&quot;Political speakers, newspaper editors, economists, all tell us that, if only we canestablish an expansionist economy for the world, all other things will be givento us. Freedom from want will follow automatically and in its train will comeall other desirable freedoms. As to how an &quot; expansionist economy &quot; is to bebrought about, theories differ. The monetary enthusiasts believe that all that isrequired is to give every one enough credit, regardless of his capacity to produce -the equivalent of that credit. The nutrition enthusiasts urge that if only allthe world&apos;s stomachs can be kept continuously expanding there will be abundantremunerative employment for all in the brief intervals between meals. A largerbody consists of those who contrast the great economic contraction of twelve years ago with the Golden Age of Nineteenth Century laisser faire expansion,and, mistakenly assuming that the contraction was due to the emergency measures taken to limit its consequences, argue that a new era of expansion can be broughtabout by agreements to limit tariffs and abolish quotas and exchange restrictions.On one thing all these various schools are agreed, namely that their policy mustbe of world-wide application and that there must be general acceptance of it andsome sort of international machinery to enforce it. The one question they do not ask is the one Browning deals with in the lines I have quoted above, and this is how far the nations are in fact likely to accept any world economic policy whichdoes not fit in with their conception of their several economic and politicalinterests.Economic expansion can take place in two directions : in the numericalincrease of population and in the rise of the standard of living. These tworesultants are, however, only to some extent alternative. In large measure theyare interdependent. Only a massive consumers&apos; market can provide the condi-tions under which the most far-reaching economic developments can take place.A handful of American Red Indians would never have warranted the harnessingof Niagara to give light, heat and power to a wide countryside or the productionof the cheap Ford car. The prospective decline in our own population creates,not a vista of decreasing unemployment and higher standards, but grave problemsof how our industries are to be sustained and our social and imperial policy to be financed. On the other hand, the increase of India&apos;s population in ten years by over fifty million peasants living on the margin of subsistence may be a tribute to the Pax Britannica, but has added comparatively little to India&apos;s total wealth,and still less to its standard of living. There is, in fact, an optimum figure,varying, no doubt, with every country at every stage of its development, at whichthe interaction of numerical totals and standards of living produces the bestresults.In the world as it is that optimum figure is influenced, not only by the competitive economic advantages of mass,-e.g,, the exporting advantage enjoyed by an industry with a large home market, but also by the problem of defence.&apos; It[26024] eCONFIDENTIAL.W.P. (43) 388.2nd September, 1943./YvAR CABINET.
is no use, therefore, advocating world policies which would prevent individualnations from planning their own economic system with a view either to theirown economic and defensive optimum or to their effective control of all industriesthat bear upon defence.The economic expansion of any particular nation depends,-in part, uponthe natural resources of its territory, but even more upon the skill, ability,inventiveness and enterprise of its people, both individually and collectively,including, not least, the economic policy of its Government. The moreabundantly diversified and more evenly balanced the natural resources the greater the opportunity for mainly self-contained expansion, providing the human factorsexist or can be stimulated. The more limited in quantity or range the natural resources, the greater the need for completing the balance of production and consumption by external trade. All nations are interested in international trade.But the extent of their interest and the particular form which it may take varyenormously. It is an interest which depends not upon the mere volume of theirexternal trade, but upon the measure in which it contributes to the balance oftheir own economy.If we in this country import raw cotton and pay for it by exporting a portionof that cotton in finished goods, the rest of the finished goods so producedrepresent a national profit or economic expansion. If we exchange finished cotton goods for other finished cotton goods the transaction may, owing to some slightdifference in price or taste, benefit individual traders. But it represents no appreciable expansion of our national economy. If, lastly, we exchange cottonyarn for finished cotton goods from abroad the transaction, while similarlyprofitable to those immediately concerned, may be directly prejudicial to our economic development, and represent an actual contraction of our economy. Yetall these three transactions may figure as of equivalent value in our tradestatistics. The gross figures of a nation&apos;s international trade are, therefore, nomeasure of its prosperity. Nor is a merely quantitative increase of international trade ,at large evidence of a corresponding expansion of a balanced world production and consumption.On the contrary, the unregulated and unbalanced flow of international trade on laisser faire principles may, like the unregulated flow of water, prove disastrous to all concerned. Deluge and drought, boom and slump, over-production side by side with under-consumption, are in each case the natural concomitants of leavingwater or trade and investment to find their own level. In a world of indiscriminatepromiscuous free trade, based entirely on immediate price competition, nations with immense potentialities, human and material, may never have the opportunityof developing them; those with high standards of living or heavy defence obliga-tions may find their industries destroyed piece-meal. Not only the peoples most directly injured, but the whole world would be the loser by such a state of affairs.Anyhow, whatever policy may or may not be good for the world at large,individual nations are not in the least likely to give up the right to exercise a selective and discriminatory control over their external trade in the interests oftheir own expansion, or of their own economic stability and political security. any policy which aims at the greater welfare of humanity as a whole through inter-national economic co-operation must take account of that fact. Any policy whichmerely aims at getting rid of &apos;&apos; barriers to trade &apos;&apos; and of eliminating&quot; discrimination &quot; is bound to come to nothing in practice, however much it maybe applauded at international conferences or even endorsed by the setting up of high sounding international committees which presently fade out in futility.It is of the very essence of a national economic policy as distinct fromlaisser faire which is the denial of national policy in the field of economics thatit is selective and discriminatory. It will aim at importing, whether directlythrough State agency or through encouragement of one kind or another to theprivate trader, the goods which will contribute to its expansion and check ordiscourage the use of its available exchange for the purchase of goods which donot contribute to that end or may even be prejudicial to it. If it employs themethod of a tariff or of quantitative regulation it does so not as a &quot; barrier &apos;&apos; totrade at large, but as a screen or filter by which to secure the goods it wants tothe full extent of the purchasing power furnished by what it is able, or can afford, to sell. The extent to which and manner in which it exercises that selectivepower will depend on the conditions of each particular nation.The most spectacular recent example of a policy of rapid economic expansionis that furnished by Russia. The Soviet leaders set out with, two great assets,vast undeveloped natural resources and a vast population, naturally intelligentbut uneducated -uneducated not only in the literary sense, but in all industrial
skill and experience. In order to force the simultaneous development of both,these assets, they confined their foreign trade strictly to the import of sucnindustrial plant as they could not possibly yet make for themselves and of acertain number of technicians, and to the export of whatever was necessary tosecure these essentials. The method was drastic and involved much incidentalsuffering and the postponement of any immediate improvement in the standardof living to securing the foundations of economic and military strength. but who will say that it has failed of its purpose, or that the industrial powerdisplayed in producing guns may not eventually be directed to producing&quot;butter&quot;? &apos; ^ .     .       -Even more remarkable in some ways has been the expansion in the last sixtyyears of the United States: Here, under a capitalist system, policy concentrated on the import of capital (in fact capital goods) and of human labour and enter-prise, and on the discouragement by high, &quot;tariffs of the import of finished con-sumers&apos; commodities. In this instance the desired end was attained throughouton a high standard of living, and the total economic energy of the 130 millionAmericans is many times as great as that of 180 million Russians. The expansionof Germany after 1880 was the result of a similar national policy. At any givenmoment the policy of each of these three countries may have interfered with someprofitable trade with the outside world, and with the immediate convenience of&quot;some consumers. But will anyone suggest that the world is not richer to-daybecause of the immense stimulus which deliberate policy in each case gave toenterprise and technical skill, or that the same result, could have been achieved bya policy of economic laisser faire\What of our own case? There again we pursued for centuries a policy ofdeliberate economic expansion based on selection and discrimination. To buildup our woollen industry we taxed the export of raw wool and the import ofwoollen cloth. Our cotton industry was created by the absolute prohibition ofimports and by a bounty on exports as well as by the inventions which naturallyaccompanied a vigorous national policy of promoting industry in every direction..Qur world-wide shipping was captured from the Dutch by the Navigation Acts..Then, a century ago, when our industry exceeded that of the rest of the worldboth in efficiency and in volume, and in the capital behind it, even more than is thecase with the United States to:day, we believed it to be in our interest and in thatof the world to adopt the then fashionable laisser faire doctrines of the economists..Whether the amazing expansion of the next thirty years was due to free trade on our part, or to low tariffs elsewhere, or was not mainly due to thegeneral world expansion consequent on the opening up of new countries and thegreat gold discoveries and to the immense start we had in furnishing the plant and transport required by that expansion may be a disputable point. In anycase, that expansion was checked by the great fall in prices at the end of the&apos;seventies and by the abandonment by all the, major countries of previous half-hearted flirtations with Free Trade in favour of a more definite nationalistpolicy. So far as the utilisation of our agricultural resources was concerned theperiod of expansion, and incidentally of high wheat prices, which lasted forthirty years after Free Trade was followed by two generations of steady con-traction with a consequent grave loss of internal purchasing power. Thanks tothe momentum of the past and to the fact that large areas of the world had still not begun national economic policies, we continued to carry on a vast external trade. But in sheer productive power we were rapidly being left behind bynations like America and Germany, while in neutral markets and even in our own home market our position was steadily growing weaker. In the end thedepression of the thirties forced us to abandon a, policy which had long beenhopelessly out of date.Our recovery from the crisis of 1931 was due in fact to a somewhat half-hearted and fumbling application of protective tariffs. But it was also due to ourabandonment of the gold.standard and to the fact that, at any rate in relation tothe rest of the British Empire, we were free from the shackles of the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, and were thus able to make trade agreements based oareal mutual benefit. The Ottawa agreements, such as they were, represented atany rate a first step in a policy of economic revival for all concerned. They did so without injury to the rest of the world, with which the trade of all parts of theEmpire once again began to expand. But for them the individual countries of theEmpire would each have been forced, like the countries of Europe, to pursue a,more drastically restrictive policy.[26024] B 2
It was, in fact, the inability, due to the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, of thecountries of continental Europe to establish anything in the nature of mutualeconomic co-operation which, in conjunction with the attempt to maintain thegold standard, was primarily responsible for the world economic collapse. Ifthe European countries had been able to set up a system of mutual preferenceand had thus in large measure met each other &apos;s needs, there would not have beenthe same drain of gold to America. Again, if they had hot, in an exaggeratedfear of inflation, hung on so desperately to the gold standard, their currenciesneed not have been so drastically deflated, with the resultant paralysis of alleconomic activity. As it w7as, the only instruments left to them to keep theirheads above w*ater were those very quotas and exchange restrictions which werethe inevitable result and not the cause of the economic landslide.The gold standard or, indeed, any other monetary system which subordinatesthe stability of the internal price level to parity of international exchange, andthe Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, which forbids all really fruitful bilateral orplurilateral economic co-operation based on mutuality of economic or political interest, are, indeed, survivals of the old individualist, internationalist, laisserfaire regime, which are wholly incompatible with any planned national or grouppolicy of expansion. They were primarily responsible for the last great worldcontraction and they will be a permanent obstacle to world recovery until theyare finally abandoned as desirable objects of policy.Unfortunately it is precisely as the ideal aims of economic policy that theyare regarded in America, at any rate by those who have been our best friendsover the issue of this war and by a large and influential section of the Americanbusiness world. To understand why this is so it is necessary to realise the extentto which the America of to-day resembles, not the England of to-day, but theEngland of a hundred years ago. In a great many industries her manufacturers,conscious of the immense scale and efficiency of their production are now less concerned with a home market which they are confident they can hold withouthigh protection than with opportunities for conquering world markets. Thesmaller&quot; and more broken-up those markets, the better from their point of view.Hence their objection to Imperial Preference and their insistence on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause which prevents all economic groupings. Their financiers,now that America is a great creditor country and holds most of the world&apos;s gold,are all for the fixed parity of world exchanges on a gold basis. At the same timemany American public men, bred in an intensely individualist atmosphere, with no conception of the economic and social problems of other nations, but conscious of much of the sordid lobbying which helped to frame and exaggerate pastAmerican tariffs, are to-day in a mood which is disposed to identify Free Tradewith political purity at home and with peace and goodwill abroad. The outlookof Mr. Cordell Hull, otherwise one of the best friends we have ever had, is essentially that of Cobden or Bright in bygone days.This new blend of Puritan quasi-religious Free Trade fervour with an aggres- -sive Imperialism presents us with a problem of no little difficulty. We paid lip-service to it when there was only a hope of direct American help. Since then wehave bound ourselves, directly by Article 7 of the Lease-Lend Agreement and more generally by our whole approach to commercial problems, to &quot; the elimination ofall forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce and to thereduction of tariffs and other trade barriers.&quot; By this the Americans at any rateunderstand the rigid maintenance of the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, even asagainst Imperial Preference. Although we have a strong case well-based onprecedent for holding that &quot; international &quot; does not -include &quot; inter-Imperial,&quot;yet we have apparently never openly taken that line or made it clear that theinternal relations of the Empire concern nobody but ourselves. The most we havedone is1 to treat existing Imperial Preferences as obligations which we should beready to drop if the Dominions concerned were prepared to acquiesce.Nothing could be more disastrous for this country than the literal fulfilment of Article 7 as envisaged by the Americans. We shall be dependent on thedrastically selective limitation of our imports, whether through tariffs, quanti-tative restrictions or State purchase, not only immediately after the war, but for very many years ahead. Not only our agriculture, which this time I trust is notto be once more sacrificed, but many of our industries, including our shipping, will need far more direct help than anything we have ever contemplated in the past orthan would be consistent with our commitments under Article 7. The loss of the preferences, thanks to which the Empire has in recent years taken half ourmanufactured exports, would certainly not be offset by any reductions in theAmerican tariff, the chief advantages of which, under the Most-Favoured-Nation
Clause, would mainly go to lower-standard competitors. That clause again will stand in the way of really effective use in dealing with foreign countries of theunique bargaining asset we possess in our large and stable consumers&apos; market.It may well be that the dilemma will solve itself. For one thing it isimplicit in all our approaches to the problem that others besides ourselves andthe United States should come into line. Both the inherent tendencies of thenations generally and their post-war difficulties make this&quot; extremely unlikely.For another, the Americans themselves, even if the present Administration isnot succeeded by a Republican one in the near future, may, when we come togrips with the various problems, greatly modify their present theoretical out lookand, in any case, fail to reach definite agreement with us. Many high-iiownprojects will be placed on the shelf and gradually fade out in the fiercer light of real and urgent post-war necessities.The time may then come for a really effective policy of economic expansionfor the world. It will be based for each country on the fullest expansion of itsown resources, based, if these resources are inadequate or insufficiently balanced,on specific economic agreements, possibly very far-reaching in their approximationto Free Trade, with other nations with whom they may wish to enter intopermanent economic and political co-operation. This will still leave room fora considerable overspill of general world trade between nations or groups ofnations. But promiscuous world trade as such will not be the be alland end all ofeconomic policy. It will be, as it were, the low pressure cylinder for utilisingeconomic energies which have not been fully absorbed and balanced in domesticor group economies. Such a system would leave ample room for different types of economic organisation and standards of living to develop side by side withoutinterfering with each other&apos;s expansion. The British Empire, the United States,Soviet Russia, Continental Europe with its colonies, a new Far-EasternCo-Prosperity sphere on better lines, could each concentrate upon the fullestutilisation of their respective heritages, each in its own way without injury to each other and with the maximum development of their human and material sources. It is only on some such organic lines of development, corresponding to thedevelopment of the world&apos;s political structure, that true expanson will, in mybelief, be possible. For us it remains to lose no time in thinking out how sucha constructive policy can be put into effect here and in agreement with our partners in the Empire, so that when the right moment comes we can carry it out whole-heartedly and without looking back. The Nineteenth Century andits economic policies are dead and cannot be resuscitated, even to pleaseMr. Cordell Hull.   A new age will call for a new vision and new policies.
