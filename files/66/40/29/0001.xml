It is reported from ground sources that both the passenger and goods stations were still burning at 10 o&apos;clock on the following morning.The railway authorities at Basle were asked to send all available passenger-coaches for evacuation purposes, and no trains from Mannheim reached Basle onthe morning of the 10th August. Day photographic cover has not yet beenobtained.&apos;  [25981] bAircraftDate.

Milan (7th/8th, 12th/13th and 14th/15th August).The first attack, made by a relatively small number of aircraft, was very successful and a number of commercial and residential buildings near the centre of the city were hit. Three railway stations and the Pirelli works were alsodamaged.Night photographs confirmed crews&apos; reports that great success was achieved in the second attack. Photographs taken 36 hours afterwards show heavy damageby fire, and H.E. spread over the city and the area to the North-West stillobscured by smoke. Weather conditions were good for the third attack on14th/15th August, and the attack appears to have been highly successful and well concentrated.   Fires from the previous attack were still burning.Turin (7th/8th, 12th/13th August).Considerable damage was caused in the attack on the 7th/8th August, themost important item being in the State Railway Workshops (see Print No. 1).Two other stations, in addition to numbers of commercial and other buildings,also suffered. It seems probable from reports and night photographs that thesecond raid on 12th/13th August was also accurately placed. Assessment of the damage cannot yet be made.Genoa (7th/8th August).The attack on 7th/8th August caused damage mainly to large buildings,stores and warehouses in the port. It is known that at least 60 large blocks of buildings were hit and that both the main and Brignole Railway Stations were damaged.Results of Previous Raids.Hamburg.On 1st August, for the first time after the attacks on 27th/28th and29th/30th July,. Hamburg was sufficiently clear of smoke for satisfactory dayphotographic cover to be obtained, although a number of fires were still burning.The districts of Wandsbeck, Hammerbrook, Hamm, Horn and Bergfeld arevirtually wiped out; Barmbeck, Steilshoop, Uhlenhorst and Winterhude are verybadly damaged. These are comparable to London boroughs such as Wandsworth,Bethnal Green, Shoreditch.Besides those which were referred to in the last Summary of bomber command Operations, the following factories of importance are seen to have suffered more or less severely : Hamburger Gaswerke G.m B.H.Hamburger Margarine Werke von H. Voss.Julius Tester, Chemical cleaners.Heidenrich u. Harbeck, Machine Tools.Treton u. Calmon Gummiwerke A.G., Rubber.Hans Havenschild G.m B.H. Chemicals.Kampnagel A.G. Engineering.It is not yet possible to make an accurate assessment of damage to trans-portation undertakings and public utilities, but it is known that both the main railway stations of Hamburg and Aitona and others serving essential suburbanlines have been hit, as well as two tramway depots and the important NeuhoferPower Station. The town gas works has also suffered serious damage. Arrange-ments for emergency feeding appear to have been inadequate, probably owing tothe fact that large food stocks in the docks and elsewhere were destroyed by our attacks.The. best available estimate of the extent of residential devastation puts itat over 7 square miles. This is on such a different scale from anything which germany has ever experienced before, that the implications of it are quiteincalculable. Hamburg has the highest density of population of any city inGermany, in fully built-up areas reaching 200 per acre or more. It is thereforereasonable to guess that the total number of bombed out is of the order of half amillion people, and there is some confirmation of this estimate from other sources.Evacuation to the entire surrounding area has been on a vast scale. ALubeck paper reports that all available vehicles have been mobilised to assist the
railways in transporting streams of refugees from Hamburg. Attempts are beingmade to persuade administrative workers to return to the city and produce somesemblance of order out of the chaos that now exists there. Prints Nos. 2 and 3show some of the damage.Berlin.The effect on Berlin of the destruction of Hamburg has been as expected.Evacuation is taking place on a large scale and is reported to include many foreigndiplomatic representatives and at least parts of some Government offices.Remscheid.Photographs show that the destruction of the town was almost complete;70 acres of the closely built-up centre of the city have been completely devastatedand 250 out of 350 acres of the less thickly populated area have been destroyed.In all, 75 per cent, of the whole town area has been demolished.The most important high priority target in Remscheid is the formerBergische Stahlindustrie, now controlled by the Deutsche Edelstahlwerke A.G.,in which the high-grade steel produced mainly at Krefeld was forged into crank-shafts for aero-engines. This factory was badly hit and the damaged buildingsinclude that believed to be the main workshop. Another important factoryseverely damaged is Alexanderwerke A.G., which produced special machinery forthe chemical industry and components for motor transport and small arms. PrintsNos. 4 and 5 show damage at these two factories.Cologne.The final assessment of the damage caused at Cologne by the attacks on the28th/29th June, 3rd/4th and 8th/9th July confirms and amplifies previousprovisional estimates. Over 75 per cent, of the fully built-up districts has been destroyed, while in the central city area the destruction of property now amountsto 83 per cent. Factories on the west bank of the Rhine which have been damaged,in addition to those already reported, include an important cable works,a factory for shell fuzes, three machinery firms, a chemical works and analuminium foundry. On the east bank 28 of the 35 workshops of GottfriedHagen, producers principally of submarine batteries, have been destroyed andmost of the others damaged. In all, 80 factories in Cologne, of which 50 areidentified, have been damaged in these attacks.The railway workshops and marshalling yards at Nippes, which had been partly repaired after heavy damage caused in the attacks of 1942, have again been heavily damaged. It is estimated that 1,000 wagons and 300 coaches have been destroyed and damaged in Cologne as a whole.North Italy: Transformer Stations.Photographs show - that considerable damage was done to Cislago andArquata Scrivia in the attacks on the 15th/16th and 16th/ 17th July, but evidence as to the effects of it are lacking.German Morale.The following extracts from Goebbels&apos;s latest article in the VoelkischerBeobachter state very well the position of the bomber offensive in the combinedAllied attack on Germany : &apos;&apos; There is only one reply to massed terror raids, and that is ma*ssedcounter-attacks. As long as we are not in a position to reply in kind, thebest we can do is to strengthen our defences. . ... The enemy is to-dayattacking our morale. It is the duty of every individual to defend it. Ourcities have now to stand in 1943 what Britain had to stand in 1940. . .The Government is doing everything that is humanly possible. But these measures would not suffice if the people did not supplement them. The Soviets;,    are hammering against the doors of the Ukraine.&quot; The British and Americans are storming Sicily and are sending out,     their air forces to Germany to break our morale.&quot;In such a phase of the war, the morale of the people is a factor decisivefor the outcome.&quot; v./   [25981] &apos;. b 2 :-
Mining.The following mining successes have been reported : 2nd July. -Danish fishing vessel K-130&apos; damaged 2 miles off Storeklint,Moen (S. approach to the Sound).9 h July. Danish schooner Willendes sunk in Makskov Fjord (GreatBelt).11 th July. Fishing vessel Fram III sunk 6 miles outside EckernfordeFjord (Kiel Bay).14c/i July. Danish fishing vessel A-1537 Freja mined and sunk inS. end of the Kattegat.18th July. A German broadcast quotes a report from Esbjerg that the fishing cutter Vagn had been mined and sunk, and adds that she is the seventh Esbjerg fishing vessel to have been lost this year.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 24th August, 1943.
