(4,3) 368.Copy No.14tth August, 1943.WAR CABINET.RELATIONS WITH CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a despatch which I havereceived from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada on the subjectof Anglo-Canadian relations, with special reference to the announcement of the participation of Canadian forces in the attack on Sicily.C. R. A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,14 A August, i943.Office of the High Commissioner for the(No. 441.   Confidential.) United Kingdom,Sir, Earnscliffe, Ottawa, Qth August, 1943.The incident concerning the publication of the news that Canadian troops were taking part in the attack on Sicily is &quot; closed.&quot; Superficially it was only a five days&apos; wonder. On a Thursday Mr. Mackenzie King made a statement&quot; inParliament in Ottawa implying that the United Kingdom Government had opposed the proposal that the presence of Canadian troops amongst those firstlanding in Sicily should be published to the world. On the following TuesdayMr. Winston Churchill in London publicly corrected this wrong impression. Theexcitement caused in Canada by the first statement was killed by the second. but although the incident is closed, its significance is more enduring and warrantsa despatch.The Incident.2. The facts of the particular incident are distributed amongst variouscommunications of various kinds which passed between various authorities invarious parts of the world. Their precise sequence and importance cannot easily be determined. But the broad situation seems to have been as follows : several days before the attack on Sicily the Canadian authorities in Ottawa soughtassurances, through Canadian Military Headquarters in London, that properarrangements would be made to inform the Canadian Government as soon as the attack was launched, so that they could announce from Ottawa that canadian troops were in action. In due course a reply came to the effect that, for securityreasons, it had been decided not to mention the Canadians until twenty-four hours after the initial communique from Allied Headquarters in theMediterranean had announced the attack. That communique was to state only that &quot;Allied troops&quot; had landed in Sicily. The Canadian Government were ready to accept this arrangement. But they sought assurances that no more detailed information would leak from other quarters, for they naturally desired the news of Canadian landings to issue from Ottawa simultaneously with itsrelease from other places.3. .They then learned on Thursday, the 15th July, that three documentswould probably be published in connection with the landings. The first was to bethe communique referring to &quot; Allied troops.&quot; The second was an &apos;&quot; avis &quot; to theFrench people, to be- issued by General Eisenhower, which would refer to an[25928] . b
attack by &quot;Anglo-American troops.&quot; The third was a proclamation to theItalian people (originally to be issued also by General Eisenhower, but afterwardschanged for issue by President Roosevelt and. Mr. Churchill) which would refer to &quot;British and American forces&quot; being engaged in the invasion of Sicily.4. The Canadian Government sent instructions on the Thursday afternoon to Canadian Military Headquarters in London and to their High commissioner in London and their Minister in Washington to make representations against this omission of any reference to the Canadians. They urged that in the two latter documents Canadian troops should be mentioned with their British and american comrades-in-arms. They also pointed out that if either of these documents were to be issued at about the same time as the communique, there wasno purpose in the communique referring only to &quot; Allied troops.&quot; and suggestedthat in that case British, American and Canadian troops should all be mentionedin it. They asked that in any case the first communique to mention British and american troops should also mention the Canadians.5. &apos; These representations were equally successful in London and Washington.From both capitals instructions went to North Africa that the communique and&quot;avis&quot; should include references to the Canadian troops, and it was agreedthat the proclamation to the Italian people should be similarly amended. But,unfortunately, the circumstances of the greater physical distance between Londonand Ottawa and the difference of six hours in their time made it appear thatLondon was slower than Washington in agreeing to the Canadian request. Forby the time that a cable had been cyphered in Ottawa on Thursday afternoon,despatched across the Atlantic and decyphefed in London it was the small hoursof Friday morning there. Mr. Massey was presumably in bed and. did not receivethe instructions until he went to his office several hours later. He could not make his representations until he, Mr. Attlee and General Ismay could meet some timelater still, and his reply then took a few more hours to reach Ministers in Ottawa.6, On the other hand, when the instructions from Ottawa reached Wash-ington it was still early on Thursday evening there. The Canadian Ministerhappened to be away and Mr. Pearson, the Counsellor-Minister, was in chargeof the Legation. I understand that he telephoned to Ottawa to ask whom heshould make representations to. Military communiques were not the businessof the State Department, and he could not contact anyone of sufficient seniorityin the War Department. Mr. Mackenzie King thereupon telephoned to Mr. HarryHopkins and asked whether he could arrange for Mr. Pearson to see the Presidenthimself. As a result the President and Mr. Hopkins received Mr. Pearsonimmediately after dinner. Mr. Roosevelt quickly agreed to the Canadianrequests and told Mr. Pearson that he could assure his Prime Minister that hewould at once issue the necessary instructions. Mr. Pearson telephoned this backto Ottawa that same Thursday evening.7. Mr. Mackenzie King was particularly anxious to have the matter settledsatisfactorily that evening, because it seemed possible that the announcement ofthe Sicilian landings would be made early the next morning.8. In the end it was not made until later the following evening. when mr. Vincent Massey&apos;s message reporting the London authorities&apos; agreementarrived later that day it of course added nothing to the assurance which mr. Mackenzie King had already received from Washington the evening before.It reported that instructions had been sent to Allied Headquarters in north africa, but could not yet say that these instructions had been received and wouldbe acted on. Moreover, on that same day a message came from CanadianMilitary Headquarters in London, in answer to an earlier query, giving reasons why security considerations alone should preclude any mention of canadian troops during the first twenty-four hours. Mr. Mackenzie King assumed that thiswas confirmation of his instructions from London that he could announce nothingabout the Canadians until the day after the first announcement of the attack.9. Then, on Friday evening, the news of the landings was published. TheWashington broadcast announcer referred to the presence of Canadian troops.Mr. Mackenzie King immediately felt free to issue a statement of his own onthe subject. He believed that this happy end to two days of agitated uncertaintywas due entirely to President Roosevelt&apos;s intervention. He felt grateful to washington and. angry with London. His feelings were shared by the wholeCanadian Cabinet and most of their advisers.
10. His and their emotions were understandable since the occasion was thefirst entry of a division of the Canadian Army into battle after more than threeyears of patient waiting in Britain.11. At first, Mr. Mackenzie King gave no public expression to his feelings..He had no reason to complain that the Canadians&apos; exploits in Sicily receivedless notice in the world&apos;s press than those of the British and Americans, andthat was his main concern. But in the following week agitation on certain aspects of the subject arose in the House of Commons. Why was Canada nottold how large a Canadian force was fighting in Sicily % Why was the nameof the Canadian Commander not published&apos;? And so on. Colonel Ralston, theMinister for Defence, had, in fact, telegraphed through London to North Africafor permission to publish these bits of information. But he could get no answerwhatever to his queries. On Wednesday, the 14th July, Mr. Mackenzie King,in answer to Questions in Parliament, made a restrained and fair statementpleading security reasons against too much information being given and generallysupporting the policy of the British and American authorities.12.&apos; But Parliament, the press and the public became very critical. when asked another Question on the following day, Mr. Mackenzie King made anextemporary statement (appended to this despatch) in which he said in effect thatthe London authorities had been reluctant that any early announcement aboutCanadian troops in Sicily should be made, and that only the intervention of president Roosevelt had secured the news for Canada.The Result.13. This statement caused a sensation in Canada. Mr. Mackenzie Kingended his speech with a fervid declaration that he would see that Canada&apos;ssoldiers received equal recognition with those of Britain, America or any other united Nation. He was loudly cheered in every part of the House of Commons.When his statement was published in the newspapers and over the wireless that evening it caused pained astonishment. Criticism of Britain was heard on all sides. Her friends in all parties felt keenly disappointed at her allegedattitude. Her critics were secretly delighted. Anglo-Canadian relations hadreceived a hurt which will not be completely healed for years. For althoughsubsequent explanations have satisfied most Canadians that the british authorities were well-disposed and equally anxious with the Americans for properrecognition of Canada&apos;s troops, the enemies of the British connection such asNationalist politicians in French-Canada^ will continue to quote Mr. mackenzie king&apos;s remarks on every suitable occasion.14. When the statement was published in Britain it naturally caused astir. On Sunday the 25th July, Mr. Churchill sent a message through me toMr. Mackenzie King saying that he was being asked a Parliamentary question on the subject on the following Tuesday, that he obviously could not accept thesituation as created by Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s statement, and that equallyobviously he wished to give an answer which was helpful to everyone concerned.He asked Mr. Mackenzie King for suggestion as to what he should say.15. When I delivered the message to Mr. Mackenzie King that evening he&apos;asked what Mr. Churchill meant when he said that he could not accept the situa-tion created by his statement. I said that his statement left the impression that,whilst the American authorities had agreed to the request for references to canadian troops in the announcements of the Sicilian landings, the british authorities had resisted it. Mr. Churchill could not accept the suggestion thatthe British had adopted any such attitude.16. At that Mr. Mackenzie King became angry. He told me that I couldreply to Mr. Churchill that if he made any answer to his Parliamentary Questionwhich reflected on the truth of his (Mr; Mackenzie King&apos;s) statement, he(Mr. Mackenzie King) would seek a dissolution of Parliament and appeal to thecountry on that issue. Nor would he fight the Election on this single incident.He would appeal against the treatment of Canada by the British Government on many occasions during the last two years. The Government in Londonfrequently forgot that Canada was a Dominion. They treated her as a colony.He and his colleagues fully recognised that in war the normal processes of peace-time government were inapplicable. The urgency bf many situations required a concentration of the power to take decisions in two or three Allied Governments.[25928] . b 2
The Canadian Cabinet had readily accepted that decisions on the strategy of thewar should belong primarily to Britain and the United States. They had gladlyaccorded supreme leadership to Mr. Churchill and President Roosevelt. But theGovernment in London had gone much further &quot;than the emergency warranted.On matters where the Canadian Government could and should be consulted theydispensed with that consultation and ignored Canada&apos;s rights as a free memberof the British Commonwealth. He mentioned the failure to consult Canadaabout the Combined Boards, about the shackling of prisoners, and about suchan important political statement of United Nations policy as was contained in the presidents and Prime Minister&apos;s proposed proclamation to the Italian people.On these and other occasions he and his Cabinet had felt strong resentment.Some of his. colleagues were so angry that they wished public protests to be made,so that the Canadian people as a whole might learn of Canada&apos;s treatment. Buthe had so far prevailed on them to remain quiet. None of them wished to prejudice the United Nations&apos; unity and strength. But there were limits beyond which they could not allow things to go. He had sometimes permitted himself to be ignored in a way that no Canadian Prime Minister should be. He had been criticised for this by his friends as well as his critics. But he was prepared toput up with that in the interests of good relations amongst those responsible for conducting the war efforts of the United Nations. He was not prepared, how-ever, to remain quiet when Canadian soldiers were put in a position of inferiorityto those of Britain and America. The time had come for him to speak out. Ifnecessary he would fight an Election on the whole issue, and the vast majority ofhis countrymen would support him.17. He strode angrily up and down the room whilst saying these things.At this point I interrupted to say that by his permission I had read his copiesof the relevant documents about the publication of the Canadian troops&apos; presence in Sicily, including communications to and from Mr. Massey in London andMr. Pearson in Washington. After reading his statement to Parliament I had expected that I would have to send a telegram to my Government saying thatsomeone in London had blundered. But instead I found that London&apos;s attitude had been as unexceptionable as Washington&apos;s. The attitudes of the two Govern-ments were precisely the same, and they had actually co-operated in sendinginstructions to Allied Headquarters in North Africa to carry out the Canadianrequests. He had misunderstood the British authorities&apos; attitude, and had beenunfair to them.18. He was surprised at this and vigorously contested my opinion. Weargued the facts of the case for a long time. It was clear that he had not appre-ciated the significance of the factors of distance and time between Ottawa and london, as described, in paragraphs 5, 6 and 8 above. He had also missed someother revelant points in the exchanges of messages with London. But when Ipressed these on him he retorted that in any case it should not have been necessaryfor the Canadian Government to make any representations to London. TheLondon authorities ought never to have approved such expressions as &apos;&apos; Anglo-American &quot; troops in the &quot; avis &quot; to France and &quot; British and American forces &quot;in the proclamation to Italy. This ignoring of the Canadians was characteristicof the present British Government^ inconsiderate attitude to the opinions of the.Dominions, and their over-ruling of those opinions as though the Dominions were still colonial dependencies.19. I answered, that this remark was a misrepresentation of the Londonauthorities&apos; attitude. They generally erred on the other side when Dominiontroops were in action. One of the main complaints against them during most ofthe war had been that they mentioned the Dominions troops&apos; part in battles soprominently and that of United Kingdom regiments so modestly that the americans and others gained the impression that the Dominions were doing allthe fighting whilst our soldiers stayed at home.20. Mr. Mackenzie King replied that Mr. Churchill and other UnitedKingdom Ministers in their speeches and conversations paid comparatively littleheed to the Dominions&apos; part. They always spoke of British and American troops,and of the R.A.F. and the American Air Force. They rarely mentioned the royal canadian Air Force, although its part alone in the offensive against Europe wasbigger than that of the American Air Force. Nor did they mention other dominion Air Forces, although these too were over Germany whenever the R.A.F.were. They never gave any indication, either, that a very large percentage ofR.A.F. aircrews themselves consisted of Canadians, Australians and other dominion officers and men.
21. We argued these points all the evening. Mr. Mackenzie King keptreferring to other occasions when Canada had, in his opinion, been treated withgross lack of consideration by the British Government. I mention some of theselater in this despatch.. He said that he had often wondered how long thesituation could last without a serious breach. His colleagues and others who.knew what was happening were becoming steadily more discontented. He showedme a few of the many letters of congratulations, including some from well-knownpolitical opponents,&apos;which he received after his statement about the allegedattempt to omit the Canadians from the first announcements of the Sicilianlandings. These assured him of unqualified support, and some of them saidthat their only criticism was that he had remained silent too long about Canada&apos;simproper treatment.22. I maintained that his and my prime concern at the moment was the incident of the Sicilian landings, that he was wrong in this matter, and that heshould suggest the lines of a helpful reply for Mr. Churchill to make to his parliamentary Question. At first he said that he would suggest nothing. Butin the end I persuaded him to consider a reply attributing the incident to a misunderstanding due to the apparent slowness of answers coming from Londonowing to the difference in space and time between the two capitals. He agreedto think over the suggestion and discuss it further with me the next morning.23. I met him again then. He was less angry, but still asserted thatLondon&apos;s attitude had been unsatisfactory, and that if he had not appealed to president Roosevelt nothing would have been done. So we argued the wholecase over again. By lunch-time he was rather nearer agreeing to suggest an answer for Mr. Churchill. When we met to continue the discussion in the afternoon he was in friendly mood once more and agreed to a draft answer.24. The incident ended with the amicable exchange of messages between him and Mr. Churchill of which you are aware. When I asked him whether he still wished me to tell Mr. Churchill that if he gave an unsatisfactory Parlia-mentary reply at Westminster there would be a General Election in Canada, heanswered in the negative.The Explanation.25. As the above narrative indicates, the fierceness of Mr Mackenzie King&apos;sand his colleagues&apos; feelings over this incident was not produced simply by the incident itself. It was an expression of accumulated resentment over a succes-sion of other incidents. This resentment had been more or less bottled up inthe interests of maintaining apparent complete harmony between Britain and canada fighting as comrades side by side. But on this occasion the anger which ministers had been able to restrain on less emotional issues boiled over. they thought that Canadian soldiers on their first weighty entry into battle were beingslighted.26. I should add that part of the misunderstanding of the british authorities&apos; attitude in this matter of the Canadian landings in Sicily was dueto Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s preoccupation at the time with other affairs. Ithappened that during the two days when the negotiations about the forms of the communique and other documents were proceeding he was engaged in debates ohhis departmental estimates in the House of Commons. These debates started each day at eleven o&apos;clock in the morning and ended at eleven o&apos;clock at night.He had to be in his place in the House throughout. A long sessionwas drawing to a close. He was tired and harassed. His principal civilservice advisers (Mr. Heeney, the Secretary to the Cabinet, and Mr Robertson,the Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs) had also, in accordancewith Canadian practice on such occasions, to be in constant attendanceon the floor of the House. In these circumstances I do not think that he managed to appreciate as exactly as would otherwise have been the case the significance of the various messages passing between Ottawa and London and Ottawa and washington.27. Mr. Mackenzie King would never, of course, have carried out his threat of an Election. The damage to friendship between Canada and Britain, as wellas to other good causes about which he also cares deeply, would have been toograve. His threat was merely an unconsidered epxlosipiupf his pent-up feelings.But it is an indication of how serious the situaf^6^fs1&apos;^TIe knows that irritationat Canada&apos;s treatment is extending steadily through the Dominion, and that heis being criticised for being too acquiescent.
28. The incident itself is closed. But. the feeling which flared up suddenlyand has now subsided has not dissolved. It persists and is widespread amongstMinisters, other public servants and informed citizens throughout Canada.Unless we recognise that, we shall not have learned the lesson of the incident.And unless we take action to reduce that feelipg, the strength of the partner-ship between Canada and Britain, and I suggest other Dominions as well, willbe impaired.29. United Kingdom Ministers who visit Canada get - an incompleteimpression of Canada&apos;s sentiments towards Britain. You all exert a hypnoticeffect upon your Canadian hosts. The magnificent genius of the Prime Ministerand the prestige surrounding you, Sir, and the Foreign Secretary over-aweCanadian Ministers when they find themselves momentarily in your presence.This is one of the last survivals of that period of Colonial tutelage to Britainout of which Canada has passed, and which these Ministers themselves are/ amongst the first to relegate to the irrevocable past. They appreciate your visits,- and treat you with a respect which makes them incapable of expressions aboutBritish policy couched in other than impeccably polite terms. They do not feel the same respect for a High Commissioner. When you have left Ottawa,believing that all is for the best in the best of all possible canada, they turn round and tell me exactly what they feel about Britain. Their sentiments area mixture of affection, admiration, gratitude and annoyance.30. I need not expand on the affection, admiration and gratitude. AHdecent people in the world feel those things for the British people now. Theyare especially sincerely felt by the Canadians who are bound to the British byhistory, political faith and blood. About the annoyance I have often writtenin earlier telegrams, letters and despatches. I have urged that we should fulfilscrupulously our constitutional obligations to Canada as a sister nation in theBritish Commonwealth. I should be a bad servant of the British Commonwealthif I did not now write of the situation again with complete frankness.31. Mr. Mackenzie King and his Cabinet sincerely appreciate the remarkable amount of information on many aspects of military and diplomaticdevelopments which they have received from the Prime Minister and yourselfduring the war. They recognise also that on most occasions when Canada&apos;interests were directly concerned the United Kingdom Government consultedthem prior to a final decision being reached. They also realise that there areoccasions in the stress of war when time does not permit the consultation whichwould otherwise take place.32. Nevertheless, they maintain that there have been other occasions onwhich the situation not only allowed but also demanded consultation, when it didnot take place. This, they say, has happened not accidentally one or twice, butdeliberately several times. They believe that it has been due sometimes to theUnited Kingdom Government&apos;s forgetfulness of the rights of the Dominions as members of the British Commonwealth, and at other times to the United.Kingdom-Unioed States tendency to take power into their own hands and ignore the lesser members of the United Nations. They deplore both these causes. Thisis only partly because their country&apos;s status as a sovereign nation is affronted.It is also because they believe the continuation of such practices will producetrouble inside both the British Commonwealth and the United Nations. And they attach great importance to the strength of both.33. I can best convey their objection by mentioning some of the occasionswhich they cite as showing that the British Government is not paying proper heedto Canada&apos;s position.  They claim that (1) Canada should have been consulted about the formation of the variousCombined Boards. These were clearly going to affect considerablyCanada&apos;s part in the war effort. The Cabinet particularly resentedthe fact that, worse than not being consulted, they were not eveninformed that these Boards were to be established, although some ofthe Canadian Ministers most concerned met British Ministers in washington the day before the initial public announcements of theseCombined Organisations.&apos;(2) Canada should have been consulted about the shackling of prisoners.Instead, without any warning, the Cabinet found itself committed by the United Kingdom Government^ decision either to shackling
German prisoners in Canada or to a public dispute with Britain.From the beginning Ministers here were unanimously opposed to thepolicy, as was public opinion in every political party throughoutCanada.(3) The United Kingdom Government prevented Canada from becoming a.full member of the Central Committee of the Post-War Relief and rehabilitation Organisation. The Canadians know that when theAmerican Government at first favoured a Central Committee of seven,the United Kingdom Government opposed it and advocated a central committee confined to the &quot;Big Four&quot; Powers. The british governments later championship of Canada&apos;s claim, though it wasnot wholly successful, made some amends for their earlier opposition.(4) The original proposals regarding the 1939-43 Star showed lack of consideration for the position of the Canadian Army.(5) There is a tendency for British and American spokesmen to referexclusively to the offensive of United Kingdom and American armsagainst the enemy, ignoring the great part of the Dominions and other allies. They cite the apparent original United Kingdom satisfactionwith the phrases &quot;Anglo-American troops &quot; and &quot;British and american forces &quot; in connection with the invasion of Sicily, as wellas references to the R.A.F. and American Air Force only in UnitedKingdom Ministers&apos; speeches, as examples of this.    :(6) There is a similar tendency for the United Kingdom and United states government to make joint statements on war developments in which other Governments are equally concerned, without consulting those governments or associating them with the statements. For example,the Canadians, who have large responsibilities in the war against the atlantic U-boats, are very critical of the suggestion that they shouldbe excluded from participation in the proposed monthly statements on that subject.(7) There is also too. great a tendency for the United Kingdom and UnitedStates Governments to make pronouncements of high political policy..- which become binding on the United Nations without consulting other allies. The Canadian Government, whilst recognising the difficultiessometimes imposed by the time factor, look to the British Governmentto see that the Dominions in particular have an opportunity to makecomments on these proposed, statements. They sometimes find them-selves disagreeing with points of substance in the proposed statements,as they did when they suggested an alteration in the reference toGermany in the Presidents and Prime Ministers proclamation to theItalian people.34. Feeling that there is an inclination on the part of the United. KingdomGovernment to treat Canada with less than her constitutional due as a Dominion,Ministers in Ottawa no doubt exaggerate the significance of some of these seeminginstances of that inclination. When I remind them of the million preoccupationsof Ministers directing the war in London, which make occasional slips inevitable,and of the countless instances when the United Kingdom Government have informed and consulted, the Dominions on many aspects of war strategy anddiplomacy, they are impressed. Yet they are not convinced. They contend thatwhen the United Kingdom Government do not find it convenient to consult the Canadian Government, they refrain from doing so. Ministers here are not ina mood to take delight in looking out for instances of this kind. Over and overagain when the need for speedy decisions in war has led to Canada&apos;s exclusion from discussions which she would otherwise have a right to attend, they havegladly accepted the position. And when they have felt that they, had a realgrievance, they have sought to make as little fuss as possible. They have pursueda conciliatory policy which would reduce difficulties to a minimum. For example,they felt most bitterly about the shackling of. prisoners and disagreed whole-heartedly with the United Kingdom Governments policy. If they had evenhinted at that disagreement in Parliament they would, have received overwhelm-ing support from public opinion. But in order not to embarrass the UnitedKingdom Government they chose to carry out a policy which they strongly dis-approved and which involved them in widespread criticism from their own people.At the same time they restrained newspaper editors and others who knew thesituation and wished to rouse Canadian opinion from starting any such agitation.
with the same prudent temper they have avoided raising unnecessary difficultieson other occasions when they felt  aggrieved. They have supported usmagnificently and unswervingly. Let us treat them in the same comradely spirit.Their readiness to be conciliatory ought not to make us respect their standpointany the less. And certainly it ought not to make us blind to the fact that theresentment which they feel is not dissipated, but will be stored up until it burststhe bounds of their patience and goodwill again, as it did over the Sicilianincident.35. Their feelings have reached a point where they rankle badly. I urgeagain that we should give most careful heed to this situation. The Canadiansare watching it closely. Objection to it is spreading amongst many of the mostinfluential Canadians in all parts of the country. They will not feel that the restraint which they have practised in the critical period of the war need still beexerted as victory becomes certain. They will not, for example, remain silent ifCanada and the other Dominions are given a less important place than they thinkis proper in the vital discussions concerning the restoration of peace.I have. &amp;c.(Signed) MALCOLM MacDONALD.The Right Honourable Clement R. Attlee, M.P.,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,London.
