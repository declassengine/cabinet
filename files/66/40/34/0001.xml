THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 384.31st August, 1943.^^^^^Copy No.WAR CABINET.CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT on article VII OF THE MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 27th July last,* the War Cabinet approved the despatch of atelegram to Washington suggesting that a delegation from this country should visit the United.States to hold informal and preliminary conversations with theUnited States Government about the questions covered by Article VII of the mutual Aid Agreement. A telegram, of which a copy is attached, has nowbeen received from Washington reporting that the United States Governmentwelcome this proposal.2. The way is now therefore open for us to proceed and I propose, in con-junction with those of my colleagues concerned, to arrange for a UnitedKingdom delegation to leave during the first week of September. It would include official representatives of the Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Board ofTrade, the Economic Secretariat of the War Cabinet, the Colonial Office, Ministryof Food and Reconstruction Secretariat, and secretaries drawn from the WarCabinet Offices, the Dominions Office and the Reconstruction Secretariat. the delegation would be strengthened and assisted by such representatives as maybe necessary from the British Embassy and British Missions in Washington.3. The primary object of the conversations will be to obtain broad UnitedStates-United Kingdom agreement on an orderly agenda for discussion of the subjects covered by Article VII. The main subjects, on which it is hoped thatsome progress will be made, will be monetary policy, commodity policy, com-mercial policy and possibly international investment. On monetary policy theChancellor of the Exchequer has already circulated to the War Cabinet a draftdirective for the guidance of the delegation. (See W.P. (43) 383.) As regardscommodity policy, the War Cabinet will recall that on the 4th Mayt they approved the general lines of policy for the regulation of primary products andthe form in which this policy should be communicated to the United StatesGovernment. Similarly, on the 27th Julyt. the War Cabinet approved two documents for use in the discussion on commercial policy which was expectedto take place in connexion with the talks on Article VII. As -regards inter-national investment, it has always been understood that the United StatesGovernment would take the initiative and it does not seem necessary for specificinstructions to be issued at this stage to the United Kingdom delegation.4. It is possible that the United States representatives may in the courseof the conversations raise other and more specific subjects. If so, I suggest thatthe United Kingdom delegation should discuss the place which these should take in the agenda of Article VII talks and take the opportunity of informallyascertaining the views of the United States Government but should not enterinto detailed discussion of the subjects themselves.     This being the case, it* W.M. (43) 106th Conclusions, Minute 3,f W.M. (43) 64th Conclusions, Minute 1.X W.M. (43** 106th Conclusions, Minute 4.12141   [26014]
seems that, once the directive on monetary policy has been approved, the WarCabinet will already have reached decisions covering all the points on which theUnited Kingdom delegation will need instructions.5. I ask my colleagues to agree that the arrangements for the despatchof a delegation on the lines outlined above should be allowed to proceed.A. E.Foreign Office, 31st August, 1943.ANNEX.Sir R. I. Campbell to Mr. Eden.(No. 3757.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, 18th August, 1943.MY telegram No. 3546.Text of aide-memoire from State Department received to-day : Careful consideration has been given to aide-memoire which ViscountHalifax left with Secretary Hull on 4th August, 1943, in regard to proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to send to Washington,not later than first half of September, a delegation of senior officials to initiate with officials of United States Government informal and exploratorytalks envisaged by Article VII of Lend-Lease Agreement of 23rd February,1942.It is noted that British Government suggests that first object of suchpreliminary conversations should be to obtain broad agreement between thetwo Governments on an orderly agenda for discussion of Article VII. TheAmerican Government is in accord with this suggestion, and it likewiseshares view of British Government concerning great importance of attain-ment of prior agreement on such matters between American and UnitedKingdom Governments before they are discussed in a wide internationalfield.It is the view of the American Government that it would be preferable that conversations on monetary policy continue in existing channel, that is, inUnited States Treasury Department between representatives primarily ofthe two Treasuries. It is also felt that Treasury representatives should dealwith subject of international investments.American Government is making necessary arrangements for conversa-tions on commercial policy, regulation of primary products and related topicsto take place in Department of State, and will await with pleasure arrival ofBritish representatives.2. At first opportunity I will sound State Department on what lies -behindsuggestion that conversations on monetary policy should continue in existingchannel. Reference to &quot;representatives primarily of two Treasuries &apos;.- leaves it.open to us to keep State Department in play. Before and during the Junediscussions they indicated that they wanted to keep in the picture although they recognised that Treasury would naturally have to take the lead. It will also benecessary to explore State Department&apos;s views on (a) rate at which United StatesGovernment want to go ahead with monetary discussions and (b) the extent towhich monetary discussions should be related to discussions of other subjects.
