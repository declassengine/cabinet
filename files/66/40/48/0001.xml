THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT &apos;ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, AT A CONVOCATION OFHARVARD UNIVERSITY, ON MONDAY, 6th SEPTEMBER, 1943.President Conant, Mr. Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,Gentlemen of the University, Ladies and Gentlemen here assembled, the last time attended a ceremony of this character was in the spring of 1941 when asChancellor of Bristol University I conferred a degree upon United states ambassador Winant and, in absentia, our President who is here to-day andpresiding over this ceremony.The, blitz was running hard at that time and the night before the raid onBristol had been heavy, several hundreds had been killed and wounded, manyhouses were destroyed, the buildings next to the university were still burning, andmany of the university authorities who conducted the ceremony had pulled ontheir robes over uniforms begrimed and drenched. But all was presented withfaultless ritual and appropriate decorum and I sustained a very strong andinvigorating impression of the superiority of man over the forces that can destroyhim.Plere, now&apos;, to-day I am once again in academic groves groves is, I believe,the right word where knowledge is garnered, where learning is stimulated,where virtues are inculcated and thoughts encouraged. Here in the broad United,States, with a respectable ocean on either side of us. we can look out upon thewnrld in all its wonder and in all its woe.But what is this that I discern as I pass through your streets, as I look roundthis great company ? I see uniforms on every side. I understand that nearly thewhole energies of the university have been drawn into the preparation of american youth for the battlefield. For this purpose all classes and courses havebeen transformed and even the most sacred vacations have been swept away in arouncl-the-year and almost round-the-clock drive to make warriors and techniciansfor the fighting fronts.Twice in my lifetime the long arm of destiny has reached across the oceanand involved the entire life and manhood of the United States in a deadlystruggle. There was no use saying : &quot; We clon&apos;t want it. We won&apos;t have it. Ourforbears left Europe to avoid these quarrels. We have founded a new world whichhas no contact with the old.&quot; There was no use in that. The lone; arm reachesout remorselessly and everyone&apos;s existence, environment and outlook undergo aswift and irresistible change.What is the explanation, Mr. President, of these strange facts and what arethe deep laws to which they respond ? I will offer you one explanation. There areothers, but one will suffice.The price of greatness is responsibility. If the people of the United states had remained in a mediocre station struggling with the wilderness, absorbed intheir own affairs and a factor of no consequence in the movement of the world,they might have remained forgotten and undisturbed beyond their protectingoceans. But one cannot rise to be in many ways the leading community in thecivilised world without being involved in its problems, without being convulsed by its agony, and inspired by its causes. If this has been proved in the past, as it hasbeen, it will become indisputable in the future. The people of the United Statescannot escape world responsibility. Although we live in a period so tumultuousthat little can be predicted, we may be quite sure that this process will be inten-sified with every forward step that the United States make in wealth and power.Not only are the responsibilities of this great Republic growing, but the worldover which they range is itself contracting in relation to our powers of locomotionat a positively alarming rate.We have learned to fly. What prodigious changes are involved in that new-accomplishment ! Man has parted company with his trusty friend the horse andsailed into the azure with the eagles, eagles being represented by the internalcombustion engine. Where then are those broad oceans or vast staring deserts?They are shrinking beneath our very eyes. Even elderly parliamentarians likemyself are forced to acquire a high degree of mobility; but to the youth ofAmerica as to the youth of all the Britains I say : &quot; You cannot stop. There isno halting place at this point. We have now reached the point in the journeywhere there can be no pause. We must go on. It must bo world anarchy orworld order.&apos;&apos;Throughout all this ordeal and struggle which is characteristic of our age youwill find in the British Commonwealth and Empire good comrades to whom youare united by other tics besides those of state policy and public need.   To a large[20083] B
extent there are the ties of blood and history. Naturally I, a child of both worlds,am conscious of these. Law. language, literature these are considerable factors.Common conceptions of -what i - right and decent, a marked regard for fair playespecially to the weak and poor, a stern sentiment of impartial justice and above all the love of personal freedom or. as Kipling put it, &quot; Leave to live by no men&apos;sleave underneath the law.&quot; These are common conceptions on both sides of theocean among the English-speaking peoples. We hold &quot;to these conceptions as strongly as you do. We do not war primarily with races as such. As you have said. Mr. Governor, tyranny is our foe. Tyranny is our foe. Whatever trappingsor disguise it wears, whatever language it speaks, be it external or internal, wemust forever be on our guard, ever mobilized, ever vigilant, always ready tospring at its throat. In all this we march together, not only do we march andstrive shoulder to shoulder at this moment under the fire of the enemy on the fields of war, or in the air, but also in those realms of thought which are consecrated tothe rights and dignity of man.At the present time. Mr. President, we have in continual vigorous action the British and United States Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee which worksimmediately under the President and myself as representative of the british war Cabinet. This Committee, with its elaborate organization of staff officersof every grade, disposes of all our resources, and in practice uses British and american troops, ships, aircraft and munitions just as if they were the resourcesof a single state or nation.I would not say there are never divergencies of view among these highprofessional authorities. It would be unnatural if there were not. That is why it is necessary to have plenary meetings of principals every two or three months.All these men now know each other; they trust each other; they like each other,and most of them have been at work together for a long time. When they meetthey thrash things out with great candour and plain, blunt speech. But after afew days the President and I find ourselves furnished with sincere and unitedadvice.This is a wonderful system. There was nothing like it in the last war. Therenever has been anything like it between two allies. It is reproduced in an evenmore tightly knit form at General eisenhower&apos;s headquarters in the Mediter-ranean. where everything is completely intermingled and soldiers are orderedinto battle by the Supreme Commander or his Deputy, General Alexander, withoutthe slightest regard as to whether they are British or American or Canadian, butsimply in accordance with the fighting needs.Xow in my opinion it would be a most foolish and improvident act on the partof our two governments, or either of them, to break up this smooth running andimmensely powerful machinery the moment the -war is over. For our own safety,as well as for the security of the rest of the world, we are bound to keep it working and in running order after the war, probably for a good many years, not only tillwe have set up some world arrangement to keep the peace, but until we know&apos;thatit is an arrangement which will really give us that protection we must have fromdanger and aggression a protection we have already had to seek across two vastworld wars.I am not qualified, of course, to judge whether or not this would become a party question in the United States, and I would not presume to discuss that point. I am sure, however, that it will not be a party question in Great Britain.We must not let go of the securities we have found necessary to preserve our lives and liberties, until we are quite sure we have something else to put in their placewhich will give us an equally solid guarantee.The ^reat Bismarck for there were once great men in Germany is said tohave observed towards the close of his life that the most potent factor in humansociety at the end of the 19th century was the fact that the British and. Americanpeoples spoke the same language. That was a pregnant saying. Certainly it has enabled us to wage war together with an intimacy and harmony never beforeachieved among allies. This gift of a common tongue is a priceless inheritanceand it may well some day become the foundation of a common citizenship.I like to think of British and Americans moving about freely over eachother&apos;s wide estates with hardly a sense of being foreigners to one another. ButI do not see why we should not try to spread our common language even more widely throughout the globe and. without seeking selfish advantage over any.possess ourselves of this invaluable amenity and birthright.Some months ago I persuaded the British Cabinet to set up a Committee ofMinisters to study and report upon Basic English. Here you have a plan thereare others, but here you have a very carefully wrought plan-for an international
language capable of very wide transactions of practical business and of inter-change of ideas. The whole of it is comprised in about 650 nouns and 200 verbsor other parts of speech no more indeed than can be written on one side of asingle sheet of paper. What was my delight when the other evening, quiteunexpectedly, I heard the President of the United States suddenly speak of the merits of Basic English, and is it not a coincidence that, with all this in mind, Ishould arrive at Harvard in fulfilment of the long-clated invitation to receive thisdegree with which President Conant has honoured me. Because Harvard has.done more than any other American University to promote the extension of basic English.The first work on Basic English was written by two Englishmen,Ivor Richards, now of Harvard of this University and Ogden of CambridgeUniversity, England, working in association. The Harvard Commission onEnglish Language Studies is distinguished both for its research and practicalwork, particularly in introducing the use of Basic English in Latin America,and this Commission your Commission is now, I am told, working withSecondary schools in Boston on the use of Basic English in teaching the mainlanguage to American children and in teaching it to foreigners preparing forcitizenship. Gentlemen, I make you my compliments. I do not wish to exaggerate, but you are at the heaclstrearns of what might well be a mighty,fertilising and a health-giving river. It would certainly be a grand conveniencefor us all to be able to move freely about the world, as we shall be able to do more freely than ever known before, as the science of the world develops to beable to move freely about the world and be able to find everywhere a medium,albeit primitive, of intercourse and understanding. Might it not also be an advantage to many races and an aid to the building up of our new structure forpreserving peace ? All these are great possibilities, and I say let us go into thistogether, let us have another Boston Tea Party about it. Let us go forward aswith other measures, similar in aim and effect. Let us go forward in malice tonone and goodwill to all. Such plans offer far better prizes than taking awayother people&apos;s provinces,&apos; or lands, or grinding them clown in exploitation. Theempires of the future are the empires of the mind.It would, Mr. President, be lamentable, if those who are charged with theduty of leading great nations forward in this grievous and obstinate war wereto allow their minds and energies to be diverted from making the plans to achieve our righteous purposes without needless prolongation of slaughter and destruction. Nevertheless, we are also bound, so far as life and strength allow,and without prejudice to our dominating military tasks, to look ahead to thosedays which will surely come when we shall have finally beaten down Satan under our feet and find ourselves with other great allies at once the masters and the servants of the future.Various schemes for achieving world security, while yet preserving nationalrights and customs, are being studied and probed. We have all the nne work that was done a quarter of a century ago by those who devised and tried to make effective the League of Nations aft. .he last war. It is said that the League ofNations failed. If so, that is largely because it was abandoned and, later on,betrayed, because those who were its best friends were till a very late periodinfected with a futile pacificism; because the United States, the originatingimpulse, fell out of the line; because, while Fiance had been bled white and england was supine and bewildered, a monstrous growth of aggression sprangup in Germany, Italy and Japan. We have learned from hard experience thatstronger, more efficient, more rigorous world institutions must be created to preserve peace and to forestall the causes of future wars. In this task the strongest victorious nations must be combined, and also those who have bornethe burden and heat of the day and suffered under the flail of adversity. Andin this creative task there are some who say : &quot; Let us have a world council andunder it regional or continental councils.&quot; And there are others who prefer a somewhat different organisation.All these matters weigh with us now in spite of the war, which none can say has reached its climax, which is perhaps entering for us, British and americans, upon its most severe and costly phase.But I am here to tell you that, whatever form your system of world securitymay take, however the nations are grouped and ranged, whatever derogations aremade from national sovereignty, for the sake of the&apos;larger synthesis, nothing willwork soundly or for long without the united effort of the British and Americanpeoples. If &apos;we are together, nothing is impossible. If we are divided, all will fail.[26083] n 9
I, therefore, preach continually the doctrine of the fraternal association ofour two peoples, not for any purpose of gaining invidious material advantagesfor either of them, not for territorial aggrandisement or the vain pomp of earthlydomination, but for the sake of service to mankind and for the honour that comes to those who faithfully serve great causes.And here let me say how proud we ought to be, young and old, to live inthis tremendous, thrilling, formative epoch in the human story; and howfortunate it was for the world that when these great trials came upon it therewas a generation that terror could not conquer and brutal violence could notenslave. Let all who are here remember, as the words of the hymn we have justsung suggest, let all of us that are here remember that we are on the stage of history, and that whatever our station may be. whatever part we have to play,great or small, our conduct is liable to be scrutinised, not only by history but by our own descendants. Let us rise to the full level of our duty and of ouropportunity, and let us thank God for the spiritual rewards He has granted forall forms of valiant and faithful service.American Press Comment on Mr. Churchill&apos;s Ha v abb Speech of6th September, 1943.1. Comment on the speech has been Wide and is likely to continue over aconsiderable period. The speech, the importance of which is being grasped, islikely to provide a cardinal text for concrete discussion of the Anglo-Americanfuture, ft came opportunely, during a growing nation-wide demand in theUnited States for the formulation and adoption of a specific foreign policy, after-proposals for an Anglo-American military alliance had been made by suchconservative Republicans as Ivelland and Dewey, and at a moment when therewas a strong sense of Anglo-American solidarity (tacitly acknowledged even by those who most condemned it) in the face of a disturbingly aloof Russian attitude.2. Excellently timed as it wras politically, the speech encountered severalaccidental handicaps. The White House announcement-that the speech would con-tain little of political significance deflected the attention of editors and politicalcommentators. Since many afternoon papers do not publish an edition on LaborDay, news of the speech was 24 hours old before they could print it (the majorityof American newspapers appear in the afternoon). Peculiarly enough a numberof train wrecks occurred within this same 24 hours one of them the mostsensational in many years, and monopolised headlines.3. The news coverage for the speech was good, and the headlines on thewhole were fair and favourable, emphasising Mr. Church ill&apos;s plea for closeAnglo-American co-operation after the war. These was something also in theheadlines about his proposal for the retention of present wartime Anglo-American machinery, about the inescapable world responsibility of the UnitedStates, and the future possibility of a common Anglo-American citizenship.4. There was a very large amount of praise of the Prime Ministers person and achievements and an exceptional volume of homage to his eloquence. this in itself serves to create a background favourable to the reception of any view which he may choose to express, but no example of this has been included in theappended anthology of quotations which is intended to illustrate types of attitudetowards Anglo-American co-operation rather than appreciations of the PrimeMinisters character.5. The majority of comment on the speech available to date (the10th September) comes from the eastern half of the country, and this comment,and such evidence as has arrived of reaction in other parts of the country, showsno marked observable regional variations. The differences follow a political andnot geographical pattern, and may be roughly distinguished into five main categories :  (a) Complete agreement with the Prime Ministers thesis that it is essentialto maintain after the war the smoothly running Anglo-Americanmachinery so effective at present. Such comment sometimes alludesto the necessity of adding Russia and China at some stage, hut its first love is an Anglo-American alliance.&apos; (b) A more qualified approval of the thesis, which it favours, provided thatit is to be the first step towards a world structure of some kind, andnot to a system of power politics likely to lead to another war. this attitude varies from pious hope to. stern warnings against anexclusively Anglo-American alliance.
(c) Direct criticism, usually by liberal internationalists, on the ground thatsuch an alliance is simple power politics.(d) The nationalist-isolationist opposition, which harps on the old themethat America must not entangle herself once again in an alliance with the British Empire and its imperialist and European complica-tions.   These papers pay unctuous lip-service to the Four Freedoms.(e) Speculation of varying degrees of detachment on the precise political significance of the speech and its probable effect on American politics.Quotations to illustrate these five types of attitude follow.New York Times 7th September.&quot; This speech may easily be distorted by our enemies and by our doubtingfriends. It may be argued by some that Mr. Churchill has no faith in a worldorder in which all nations will have a voice, and that he proposes to police the earth with an Anglo-American constabulary. It may be argued by some that he proposes to divide the world into Anglo-American and Russian or Russo-Chinesespheres of influence. The ghosts of old jealousies and suspicions still ride thewinds, and new- ones may rise from new battlefields.But we do not believe that Mr. Churchill has in mind an Anglo-American&apos; century &apos; or anything of the sort. The warm friendship and the comradelikeco-operation of two great peoples speaking the same language are in themselves a magnificent achievement of this war.   It does not rule out a vaster fellowship..... We do not know what form the future organisation of the earth&quot;speoples is to take.   Mr. Churchill did not profess to know..... Whatever the form, the spirit and purpose cannot be weakened by a close and continuing collaboration among the nations and dominions of the Anglo-American world..... Mr. Churchill has opened up a vast and hopeful field of discussion.Down the grim corridors of war light begins to show.&quot;Walter Lijypmann (Syndicated Columnist) 9th September&quot; We may say, too, I believe, that the more closely we study our own history and examine the facts of international life, the more likely we are to conclude that the method of alliances is the one effective form of international organisation which preserves sovereignty.For I do not believe we can surrender to the smaller Powders the right tocontrol the military force of the Great Powers. Such a scheme of things didnot work at Geneva, and it cannot be made to work now.An alliance, in other words, is not a contract to wage war at the behest ofthe allied Power. It is a contract to work together in peace to preserve thepeace, and if that becomes impossible, to wage war together so that victory is certain. An alliance, then, is not the obligation of a blank cheque. It also createsa right the right to be consulted in advance and to give consent or to.refuseit before the die is cast.That, to my mind, is the conclusive reason for thinking that an alliance,properly conceived and carried on, is the surest of all guarantees of security and, in this phase of history, the best hope of peace.&quot;Mark Sullivan (Syndicated Columnist) 7th September.&quot; What has happened now is that America has come to the conviction thatit must enter into some degree of alliance or formal co-operation with other nations, for mutual defence or broader purposes. In such a process the first andmost obvious nation to be taken into alliance would be our neighbour on our long-northern boundary, Canada. The second and simultaneous one would be Britain,that Commonwealth of Nations of which Canada is a part. The internationalarrangement we shall ultimately make may take in other nations, but Canada and Britain will be the first. However large the ultimate combination, the UnitedStates and Britain will have a special relation within it.Enthusiasts and planners may make such blue-prints of the world as theychoose and a multitude of them are laudably busy at it. But meanwhile, nature,without benefit of any plue-prints that finite planners can recognise, goes her own way. In nature, like coheres to like. If the coming organisation of the worldwere an act of nature, of physics, Britain and the United States would gravitatetowards each,other with the certainty of a natural force.The factors of likeness between the two makes the association inevitable/
Washington Star 8th September.&quot;Mr. churchill&apos;s argument is a reasonable one. The Governments of britain and the United States, under the compulsion of war, have worked out an efficient and closely knit joint military organisation. It may be doubted thatany other allies have ever worked together with such harmony and unity of purpose. But some day the war will end, and when that time comes Mr. Churchillbelieves we must continue to stand together ....He feels and it is difficult to see how there can be any dissent from the broadproposition that the United States and Britain, having worked out a dependablemeans of security, should not throw it away until an adequate substitute has takendefinite form. Until world-wide collective security becomes an established fact,the British Prime Minister would cling tightly to the very considerable measureof security that is to be found in the working alliance forged from the wartimeassociation of Britain and the United States.&quot;New York Herald-Tribune 7th September.&quot; In Mr. Churchilhs address were summed up many of the points that havebeen made, with varying degrees of emphasis, by many Republican leaders inrecent days by Mr. Kelland. Mr. Hoover, Governor Dewey who have concernedthemselves principally with the first fundamentals of the peace. His speech wasin no way in conflict with the ideas of other leaders of the party, such as mr. Willkie, former Governor Stassen and Governor Warren, who have placedgreater stress upon the ultimate goal the creation of &apos; stronger, more efficient,more vigorous world institutions &apos;; in Mr. Churchill&apos;s phrase, &apos; to preserve peace and forestall future wars.&apos; Thus the war-time association between Britain andthe United States is already being projected into the peace not as the jealouspolitical possession of one party, but as a part of America&apos;s full awakening to the choice which is facing her to stand for &apos; world anarchy or world order.&apos; &quot;Cleveland-Plain Dealer 7th September.&quot; Three profound points command careful consideration of all English-speaking peoples, for they affect the future of the United States, Great Britainand the world. These are embodied in three succinct phrases : &apos; The Price ofGreatness is Responsibility &apos;; &apos; It must be World Anarchy or World Order &apos;;; This Gift of a Common Tongue is a Priceless Inheritance, and it may well someday become the Foundation of a Common Citizenship.&apos; Few men are betterentitled to speak on.them as is Mr. Churchill. He is a product of the two worlds.Mr. Churchill made clear that it is world order which he and all responsiblestatesmen seek, and not, as some traducers of Allied co-operation have charged, an anglo-American condominium.&quot;Boston Post 7th September.&quot; It was not a plea. It was not a challenge. It was not the sweetness and-light urging of a giddy dreamer. It was the warning of a realist and responsiblethinker to the English-speaking people to stand together in a world of greatforces, &apos; because we have now reached a point in the journey where there can beno pause.   We must go on.   It must be world anarchy or world order.&apos;&quot; Not everyone will agree with his idea; but he projected it in the knowledge that more and more Americans have come to the conclusion since Pearl Harbourthat our nation cannot stand off the world single-handed. He offered it with theunderstanding also that many Americans, having decided that our attitudetowards world affairs during the past twenty-five years did not keep us out ofwar, might now accept a permanent partner for the sake of permanent peace.&quot;Major George Fielding Eliot (Syndicated Columnist) 8th September.&quot; Surely the hour is ripe for the first open steps in this direction. Surely thewords of the Prime Minister, and those of Governor Dewey, should now be implemented by further and definite action......... Let the world be told that Britain and America stand together not as Governments but as free peoples, understanding and trusting each other,speaking the same language and resolved upon the same purposes, and inviting-all others of good will to join with them in the establishment and maintenanceof a just, charitable and enduring peace.&quot;The Bang or (Maine) Daily News 7th September.&quot; It is hard realism and some of it is badly needed.&quot;
Boston Daily Record 7th September.&quot; This plea will not set well with isolationists, but there is no denying thathis logic is rather sound.&quot;Youngstown (Ohio) Daily Vindicator 7th September.&quot;The Prime Minister made no bones about saying that the world expectedAmerica&apos;s continued aid after the war. .... He was not proposing Anglo-Saxon imperialism. There will be the same imperative need for Anglo-Americancollaboration after the war, whatever international agency is set up.Mr. Churchill suggested it might even be made a basis for common citizenship.Americans probably will not wish to go so far, but continued close co-operation is a plain essential. It should not become a Party issue : Americans of everyshade of opinion should accept the clear fact that, whatever international action is undertaken, America and Britain must first stand together as an essentialfoundation of any stable peace. For if thev cannot work together, who is to found the New World?&quot;Ann Arbor (Michigan) News 8th September.&quot;Some Americans might be inclined to shy away from such a suggestion(common citizenship) as indicating a desire on the part of the British to dominatethis country, but there is no indication of any desire on churchill&apos;s part to haveAmerica absorbed by the British Empire or Commonwealth of Nations. It wouldappear he was speaking of citizenship in broad terms. Mr. Churchill made it plain that the peace of the world, in his opinion, will depend largely upon Anglo-American co-operation in a variety of ways. Common language is, indeed,important to international understandings, &amp;c. Air. Churchill obviously wantsAmerican and British comrades in arms to continue a similar relationship inpeace-time. There can be no objection to that. Complete union would be impracticable and undesirable due to many dissimilarities, which also exist.&quot;Johannes Steel (Radio Commentator) 7th September.&quot; churchill&apos;s speech expressed the innermost hopes of the majority of theAmerican people.   The little men at Mackinac would do well to ponder it.&quot;Charles. Eaton (Minority Leader, Foreign Affairs Committee of the House).&quot; If the English-speaking people had stood shoulder to shoulder for their interests in the past we would not have had this war. Now, we are paying theprice in blood.&quot;Raymond E. Baldwin (Governor of Connecticut).&quot; Such military collaboration as proposed is the obvious thing to do.&quot;&quot; We are doing it now,&quot; he added.(Washington Evening Star. 7th September.)New York Herald Tribune 7th September.&quot; The importance (of Mr. Dewey&apos;s and Mr. churchill&apos;s remarks) does notlie in the fact that an Anglo-American alliance would be the whole answer tothe problem of a good peace. But in one form or another such an alliance, orfree association, is the first step. To recognise the fact of a community ofinterest between the United States and the British Commonwealth is to havelearned the most elementary lesson of the two world wars. To accept thatfact openly is to lay the cornerstone of a stable world order. Mr. Churchill, atHarvard, expressed this truth bluntly and concisely : &apos; If we are together nothing is impossible, if we are divided all will fail &apos;.&quot;The Worcester (Massachusetts) Telegram 7th September.&quot;. . . . co-operation between Britain and America, with their commonlanguage and other bonds, is plainly sensible.British-American co-operation, a virtual military alliance, cannot be&apos;( regarded as the whole story, however. It should not lead to the idea that thecreation of a broader system can be indefinitely postponed after the end of thewar. Despite Mr. churchill&apos;s enthusiasm about British-American achievements,we cannot forget what Russia and China are doing. Mr. churchill&apos;s words needsupplementing. His own Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, provided the -propersupplement in his address at Annapolis last March, when he said :  &apos; It will not be enough for one country, or even two, to display thequalities necessary to protect the peace. The work will take all that america&apos; and Britain, Russia and China,, and the United Nations, can offer &apos;.&quot;
St. Louis Post-Dispatch 7th September.&quot; Great Britain and the United States have insoluble bonds of language,creeds and goal. In the world of peace as in the world of war, their front mustbe united, so enmeshed that no one nation or group of nations dare challenge it.Ours, he seemed to say. is the power and the glory : let no one try the strengthor patience of them.That accord between us is imperative none will deny. But, except for onereference to the other great allies who, with us, will be &apos; at once the masters and the servants of the future,&quot; Churchill fired no hopes for unity in foreign capitals. . . .If Stalin and Chiang and Governments-in-exile feel slighted, or wonder ifthe great fraternal Power combine will be used in &apos; service to mankind,&apos; it is because they have been given cause to be concerned, in the past and throughChurchilhs words at Harvard. Only his deeds, in time, can answer them. Itis likely our friends wish for more humility in those who take for themselves the awesome task of putting the world to rights again.&quot;The Spokane (Washington) Spokesman Review 8th September.&quot; Enduring Anglo-American unity may be accepted as axiomatic if thereis to be a durable world peace. Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement, &apos; If we are divided,all will fail,&apos; cannot be reasonably disputed. Yet, assuming an Anglo-Americanalliance as the strong foundation of peace, .what tiers of alliances above in theworld structure do our Anglo-American leaders contemplate ? Many havefavoured as the prime essential an alliance of Britain, the united States and russia including China probably. . . ..... Permanent peace hopes based on narrow alliances of great powers are doomed to frustration mainly because they inspire fear and dislike andjealousy in the world outside of the alliance area. Alliances for centuries havebeen tried out, but they never have put an end to wars. One alliance sets up achain of causation that ends in the early establishment of a rival alliance.&quot;&apos;Philadelphia Inquirer 7th September.&quot; If our enlightened self-interest suggests a peace-time military alliance with Britain, whatever its possible disadvantages, promises the best guarantee for peace for America and for the world, we should not hesitate to set it up as abasis for a wide organisation of free peoples.&quot;Boston Globe 7th September.those who listened derived the impression that Mr. Churchill wasthinking of a partnership of the two great peoples who speak a common language.While the battle is on in the air and on the oceans, and while armies aremagnificently co-ordinated, it is natural for many to think of how much Britainand the United States can accomplish in the post-war world.Yet no such combination would be sufficient to bring the assurance of securitythat must be if this planet is to be liveable. There are at least two other great powers wdiich must share in the reconstruction by which the future will be madeto look bright. These are Russia and China. In addition there is a bevy of other nations, some of them very small, which must have each a share in what is cloneif it is to be effective. Any combination of two great powers would invite a rivalcombination, and if Russia and China were added the outlook would be little better.If this man. who is great in war, also is to be great in peace, his vision must include the whole round world which belongs to the people who inhabit it.&quot;New York Post 7th September.&quot; Certainly few people will disagree with the Prime Minister in his basicassumption that with close Anglo-American collaboration everything is possiblein building an international structure for world peace and prosperity whilewithout it nothing would be possible ........ We prefer the broader, more courageous and more international viewof the world and approach to a United Nations which many Republicans have demonstrated.&quot;Anne 0&apos;Hare McCormick (New York Times) 8th September.&quot; Mr. Churchill makes an address which might be aimed at convincing Russiathat she is safer in a general security system than in her own. Mr. Churchill isnot addressing Americans only when he draws a picture of a close Anglo-Americanalliance for peace as well as for war.  If one sees lined up with the United States
the republics of this hemisphere, the combination of the Pan-American Union andthe British Commonwealth conjures up a peace-front calculated to impress eventhe Soviet Union with the advantages of joining the coalition.&quot;Christian Science Monitor 7th September.&quot; The Prime Minister, getting an Honorary Degree at Harvard, put thesituation in a nutshell :&apos; Whatever form your system of world security may take .... nothing willwork soundly or for long without the united effort of the British and american people.&apos;For the first and minimum assurance of a decent and enduring peace is continued British-American collaboration. Peace plans should not stop there,but they must necessarily begin there. Even the two other aspirations of mostAmericans hope for a genuine world security system and for friendship withRussia will be facilitated, by active British-American teamwork. Indeed, allthe most hopeful plans for an orderly and just post-war world involve as firm and strong action by Britain and America for peace as they have developednaturally, almost inevitably for war. Whatever peace structure we raise, here is the cornerstone.&quot;David Lawrence (Syndicated Columnist) 7th September.&quot;The idea that the world should have four big bosses and return to thebalance of power theory of peace by coercion seems to have taken hold in highquarters in Britain and America.This principle of domination of the world by four major powers is the verynegation of what President Woodrow Wilson pleaded for in his speeches during and after the World War.- To-day another four-power plan is espoused by well-meaning persons in ailof the four countries and when it is suggested to some of them that this is thevery way to cultivate the seeds of a third world war the answer usually given isthat Britain, America, Russia and China can be trusted to avoid the pitfalls and carry on a benevolent four-power control.What is the alternative 1 A return to the League of Nations covenant which gave every nation equal sovereignty and provided for a trusteeship-over conqueredcountries.If there is after the next armistice more courage and more character amongthe statesmen of the Allied countries the League covenant can be made effective.For it is the only pattern that insures conquered and conquerors a position of equality and opportunity in the family of nations a prerequisite to an endurino-peace.&quot;Boston Herald 7th September.&quot;The omission of Russia, China and other nations from the tentativeprogram will make many question the desirability of the Churchill-Dewey plan.&quot;St. L,ouis Globe-Democrat 8tl! September&quot;The present cordial well-knit relations, are unquestionably likely tocontinue after the war, but Anglo-American-Russian-Chinese domination is capable of engendering a third world war. These four will set the tempo, but other nations must in time have their say, including Germany, Japan, Italy and spain.   The peace must be practical and therefore just.&quot;Rochester Democrat and Chronicle 7th September.&quot; There must first be assurance of the collaboration of Russia, China andothers.&quot;Spokane (Washington) Spokesman Review 7th September.&quot; The apparent lack of unity among United Nations seems to be an ominousreality.....    Mr. Churchill is convinced Britain needs the security of amilitary alliance with the United States to survive the peace.....   He willcontinue to rely on Britain&apos;s age-old balance of power policy.&quot;Wheeling (West Virginia) Intelligencer 8th September.&quot; Coming at a time when Russia is manifestly dissatisfied with the conductof her English-speaking Allies, and apparently suspicious of their intentions,[26083J c
Mr. Churchill&apos;s bold bid for a shouider-to-shoulder British-American stand against all comers is not apt to promote confidence. Nor will other nations, itwould seem to us, whether friends or foes, relish the suggestion that all wisdomand justice reside in British and American minds, and that whatever worldorder there is to be will be dictated and imposed by England and theUnited States.Whether it is imposed by England and the United States, by Russia and japan, by Germany and Italy, or&apos; by any other combination, a dictated worldorder is not world organisation, and can no more promote international goodwillthan the Axis promoted it.&quot;Chicago Daily Tribune 8th September.&quot; Mr. Churchill at Harvard might have been content with one of hischarming occasional speeches, but chose instead to put forward with all theeloquence and tact at his command a major proposal to the American people.His plea for permanent Anglo-American military union must be regarded as one of his masterpieces, fit to stand beside the memorable : blood, sweat andtears &apos; speech with which he rallied his people to the Battle of Britain.The timing of the affair was obvious. The alien minded president ofHarvard staged the ceremony in the theatre which commemorates what is still,after three-quarters of a century, this nation&quot;s greatest martial and emotionalexperience that Mr. Churchill might direct his words to Mackinac. TheHarvard drama was designed to follow and exploit Governor Dewey&apos;s desertionof his American principles and thereby to seduce the Mackinac conference fromits American allegiance.But what Governor Dewey could not do without betraying his supporters,Mr. Churchill could. Indeed, he would have been derelict of the British peopleif he had let the opportunity pass. As it was his privilege to propose, it nowbecomes ours to dispose, in the manner that will best serve the long-term interestsof the American nation.The occasion permitted Mr. Churchill to stress the common literary heritageof the two nations. But the American people are less concerned with placingLongfellow beside Shakespeare than they are at the invitation to accept Gortand Wavell on a par of authority with MacArthur and Eisenhower.Mr. Churchill was able to make his proposal most tactfully. It is unfortunate that it must be analysed in blunter terms.He has the right idea from his point of view. Regardless of who actuallygives the orders in the field, the British are to start the wars and we are to fightthem.   England gets the benefit of our victories.The plain facts are that England, after three years of the last war, wasbeaten until the American army threw the weight in the balance that broughtvictory. In this war, England was pushed all over Europe and Africa, with herold-school-tie officers and her popgun tanks and artillery, until Americans force was first felt in the American material that our ordnance department sent to win the victory at El Alamein. We have been winning in Africa and Italy ever since,and American weapons have been followed by American soldiers. The Britishwere pushed out of the Pacific by the Japanese, and Australia would have been lost along with Malaya, Burma and the Indies but for the leadership of general macarthur and the American troops and arms and fleet that held the thin line in the Solomons.The British are committed to a social caste system. That caste systemcannot produce a modern army. And why should it if it can dominate Americanpolitics? The ruling class of England to-day is making a final brilliant fight for survival in the field in which it has always shone most, that of diplomacy.One of its minor victories is represented in the scene of Mr. Churchill V address.The alien minded Dr. Conant has striven valiantly, and not without success, tomake Harvard more English and less American than Oxford. We cannot saymore than that.Mr. Churchill asks for a long partnership. Like his new spokesman,Governor Dewey, he is dubious of the more fanatic plans for world government.He gives them fair words, but until such dreams can prove themselves he wouldbolster the British empire upon the solid rock of an American military alliance.Mr. Churchill expressed the hope that out of the priceless heritage of our common language there might in time come a common citizenship. We are are public and we  ire determined to remain a republic. The only way that theties that Mr. Churchill desires can be achieved is for the empire to come into our republican Union.  To do so it must; of course, abolish its royalty and nobility.
Whatever decision the American people may make as to the effect of sucha union upon their own interests, it would be folly to accept the British withthe handicap of the caste system that has brought them to their present lowmilitary and industrial estate. If they are to be a partner, they must apply asa healthy partner. We are not going hack into the British empire as inferiors,the position assigned to us by the sycophant Dr. Conant of Harvard and hisfellows of alien allegiance.&quot;Washington Times Herald -8th September.&quot; It now appears out of the mist that the deep reason why we went into the last war was to preserve the British Empire, which was threatened byGermany. It is for the same purpose and, perhaps, for the purpose of joiningus again to the British Empire from which we were separated by the Revolutionthat this war is being fought.In such a union, based on the immediacy of to-day &apos;s problems of commonsafety, there would be the grave problem of British imperialism.You state, Mr. Churchill, that this co-operation between us will not become a political issue in Britain, because the Empire is very sensitive to the gallsof its burden of protecting the weak, even against their wills. You do not presumeto judge whether it will be an issue on this side of the water.Only the future can tell, of course. Whether this country should wish tojoin such an empire for the regulation of the world, as a partner or member ofthe British Empire, is a matter to be cleared up by developments.One thing is almost certain, however, and it is that if we maintain a continuous military alliance with Britain, other nations are almost sure to formopposing alliances against us.&quot;New Orleans Item 8th September.&quot; The growing friendliness of successive personal receptions received over here may have misled him (Mr. Churchill) into thinking that the &apos; Union Now :of Clarence Streit is just around the corner but, unless we utterly misconceivethe average i\merican&apos;s feelings in such matters, we clo not believe that ourgrandchildren will live to see a merger of the Empire and the United States.This does not mean that canny Americans would not be willing, or possibly glad,to take the Empire into the United States on good American terms. What wemean is that we do not think that American ideas on terms of that sort are likelyto commend themselves to a people so long accustomed to domination as theEnglish.&quot;Colum.bus (Ohio) Dispatch 8th September. *&quot;Alliances have never worked. Such an alliance (as that suggested byMr. Churchill and Governor Dewey) would mean the greatest departure from american traditions and established policies in international affairs that theUnited States has ever seen. It is a. proposition which can hardly find much, ifany, favourable sentiment among Americans, even among those who are willingto go to extremes in trying to find a way of establishing peace.&quot;Henry J. Taylor (Radio Commentator) 8th September.&quot; It is incorrect to think of the British as Americans. They are not. Theyare Europeans. We think that the Europeans have our own unselfishness but thatis where we make our biggest mistake. We are openhanded, not like the confusedand crowded countries of Europe. Statesmen in Europe, Mr. Churchill included,are known more for what they, do for their own countries, not for their neighbours.We should remember this and not be let down later.&quot;Wheeling (West Virginia) Intelligencer 8th September.&quot; As for common citizenship with England, we fought in this country to freeourselves from that a long time ago. There is nothing in the record to indicatethat our welfare would be promoted by bringing this country again under the supervision of the British.&quot;Washington Star 8th September.&quot; The British Prime Minister is too good a student of American history and american politics not to be fully aware of the implications of his proposal.the danger in a suggestion of this kind, coming from the Prime Minister ofGreat Britain,lies in the possibility that it may be seized upon and distorted inan effort to make it appear as an attempt to meddle into the affairs of this country
with a view to strengthening Britain at our expense. But, happily, there hadbeen little of that in the reactions of American political leaders.&quot;Time 13th September.&quot; What Winston Churchill had to urge upon the great English-speakingpeoples had been in the air, almost palpably, since victory became certain and post-war chaos suddenly imminent. He asked that Britain and the United Statescontinue their present military alliance after the end of World War II.&quot;Baltimore Sun 7th September.&apos;&apos; By proposing a military alliance with Great Britain continuing after thewar and &apos; until we know &apos; that our joint post-war reorganisation of the world willreally give us protection against aggression, Mr. Churchill injected himself almostdirectly into American political discussion. It might even be said that he injectedhis ideas into the current &apos; deliberations&apos; of the Republican chieftains atMackinac Island.Moreover, this was no chance or casual irruption. It was clearly as deliberateas it was positive. Two weeks ago Mr. Clarence Budington Kelland, the some-what bumbling brain-truster of the Republican National Committee, proposed aleft-handed sort of military alliance with Great Britain. But only SundayMr. Thomas E. Dewey, the Governor of New York and a possible Republicancandidate in 1944, expressed the same notion, with no ifs, ands and buts.Mr. Churchill was thus giving direct support both to the timorous Mr. Kellandand the more astute Mr. Dewey.Mr. Churchill, astute assayer of public opinion as he is, has clearly beenwatching the development of American thought under the pressure of events.He knows, as well as we know, that the shadow of the 1944 Presidentialcampaign hangs with increasing ominousness over every suggestion which this administration makes and over every suggestion that he makes in reply.&quot;Newsiv.eek 13th September.&quot; On Monday, no more than 24 hours after Governor Thomas E. Dewey ofNew York had electrified Republican post-war planners at Mackinac Island withhis proposal for a peacetime continuance of our military ties with Great Britain,Winston Churchill seconded the suggestion in a speech at Harvard.Aware of the political repercussions his words would inspire, he then added :: I am not qualified, of course, to judge whether or not this would become a partyquestion in the United States and I would not presume to discuss that point.I am sure, however, that it will not be a party question in Great Britain.&apos; &quot;Quincy Howe (Radio Commentator) 7th September.&quot; ChurchilEs insistence that the United States must play a great part in thepost-war world in collaboration with Britain may help roosevelt&apos;s politicalstatus and also Dewey&apos;s just as the Quebec Conference helped Mackenzie King.Proceedings at Mackinac look like a clear-cut victory for the internationalists.But with isolationism dead there is the beginning of another battle between theChurchill-Lippmann school, which advocates making a few strong alliances afterthe war (apparently the Republicans back this up with their declaration calling for dealings between &apos; sovereign States &apos;), and the school represented by EdgarAnsel Mowrer and a number of liberals who argue that it is now a question of world collaboration or imperialism.&quot;Clarence Budington Kelland (National Committeeman for Arizona and author ofa-five-point post-war plan which includes a military alliance with Britain).&quot; I &quot;in for a permanent alliance with Great Britain if he (Mr. Churchill)doesirt include Mr. Roosevelt as a permanent part of it.&quot;Joseph Martin (House Minority Leader)&apos;.&quot;I hope Mr. Churchill is not trying to enter into any of our Americanpolicies.&apos;&apos;Ex-Senator Townsend of Delaware (Chairman of the Senate Republican Cam-pa ign Committee).&quot; It&apos;s a characteristic Churchill speech to help his friends.&quot;(Washington Evening Star, 7th September.)
