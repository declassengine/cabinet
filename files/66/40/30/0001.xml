The present meeting had been called for the purpose of discussingmatters of mutual concern to the two Governments.2. The United Kingdom Prime Minister expressed appreciation of theaction of the Canadian Government in making arrangements for the forthcoming conference, at Quebec, with the President of the United States and the combined chiefs of Staff.[25992] B
The present meeting had been arranged, in advance, for consideration of questions of common interest to Canada and the United Kingdom. Two of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments were sitting together in formal conference. As a jointsession of the British War Cabinet and the Canadian War Committee, theoccasion was unique and of major importance and should be marked by the issueof a suitable communique to the press.3. It was agreed that a special communique, prepared at the conclusion ofthe meeting by Mr. Churchill and Mr. King, be approved for immediate release.Canada&apos;s Position in Relation to Conference; British-Canadian Chiefs ofStaff Discussions.1. The Canadian Prime Minister referred to the position of the canadian government and Canadian Chiefs of Staff in relation to the forthcoming discussions with the President and the conference of the Combined Chiefs ofStaff.The Canadian Government had accepted the position that the higherstrategic direction of the war was exercised by the British Prime Minister andthe President of the United States, with the Combined Chiefs of Staff. It was recognised that the participation of the Canadian military heads, in meetings ofthe Combined Chiefs of Staff, might give rise to difficulties with, other united nations. It had been agreed that suitable opportunities would be. made for consultation between the British and Canadian Chiefs of Staff.5. The United Kingdom Prims Minister observed that arrangements hadalready been made for a meeting, that afternoon, between the British and canadian Chiefs of Staff. Further meetings could be held, subsequently, as required, and conclusions reached during these meetings could be reviewed later on by the Canadian Prime Minister and himself.6. It was agreed that the position as described by Mr. King andMr. Churchill was satisfactory.Employment of Canadian Army Overseas.7.. The Minister of National Defence pointed out that it had been, and continued to be, the policy of the Canadian Government that the Canadian Armyoverseas should be employed, in whole or in part, wherever, in the judgment ofthose charged with the strategic direction of the war, it could make the most effective contribution.Canada did not demand an equal voice in determining the high strategy ofthe war, but the military advisers of the Canadian Government should, in allcases, have the opportunity of passing comment upon operations which involvedCanadian troops, reserving the right of reference to the Canadian Governmentfor final decision.In view of the long period which most of the Canadian Army had spent in britain, in a defensive role, and the prospect of further delay before operations would be launched from the British Isles, it was, in Mr. Ralston&apos;s own opinion,desirable that additional Canadian formations should be given an opportunity ofparticipating in the Mediterranean area, possibly with the establishment of a canadian Corps Headquarters there.8. Mr. Churbhill expressed his appreciation of the desirability of employingfurther Canadian forces in active operations at the earliest possible date.Decision in this respect, however, could not be made until the Combined Chiefsof Staff had, at their coming conference, reached definitive conclusions regardingfuture strategy. Thereafter, full and sympathetic consideration would be givento the questions raised by the Minister.9. It was agreed that further consideration would be given to these matters,following the conference of the Combined Chiefs of Staff.Canada&apos;s Position in Relation to Direction of the War.10. The Canadian Prime Minister observed that the Canadian Governmenthad recognised fully that the higher direction of the war could not be exercised by all of the United Nations, and was satisfied, in this respect, that authority should rest with Mr. Churchill and President Roosevelt, and their CombinedStaffs.   While this was so, the Canadian public were increasingly concerned that
there should be adequate recognition of the substantial contribution which canada was making to the total war effort of the United Nations.It was widely felt that, while Canada had been at war two years before theUnited States, she was not being accorded, in the council of the United Nations,a role proportionate to her contribution. It was felt that in certain fields inwhich Canada was playing a major role her right to a more decisive voice mightwell be recognised.11. Mr. King stated that the Canadian Government appreciated the full information provided from day to day through the Dominions Office, the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner, and in personal messages from Mr. Churchill to himself. In most cases an opportunity was given for consideration, in advance,by the Canadian Government, where Canadian interests were affected.Nevertheless, in some instances, decisions taken jointly by the UnitedKingdom and the United States, affecting Canada, had been taken and announcedwithout opportunity for Canadian comment. Such occasioned serious difficulties for the Canadian Government. It was recognised that the necessity for rapidaction might compel certain decisions to be taken without there being time for consultation.He felt sure that the Canadian position in this respect would be appreciatedand that Canada would be fully consulted in advance wherever Canadian interests were affected.12. The United Kingdom Prime Minister expressed appreciation of thepoints brought forward by Mr. King.R.C.A.F. Relations with R.A.F.13. The Minister of National Defence for Air stated that, while from timeto time, difficulties had arisen between the Canadian Department of NationalDefence for Air and the United Kingdom Air Ministry, for the most part these had not been of a serious character and had proved capable of satisfactory solution by the two departments, relations between which were excellent.The matter of adequate mention in public announcements of the operationalactivities of R.CA.F. squadrons overseas and of Canadian personnel serving with the R.A.F. was being ironed out, though it had not yet been completely settled.It was not generally appreciated that a large proportion of R.A.F. aircrewconsisted of men from the Dominions, particularly from Canada, and, further,that separate R.C.A.F. squadrons were playing an important part in the bombing of Germany.The Canadian public were much concerned in this matter, particularly inview of the publicity given to the activities of United States Air Forces.14. The Canadian Prime Minister observed that Australia and NewZealand were in a similar position to Canada in this respect. The mention in press releases of &quot; Commonwealth&quot; Air Forces, rather than R.A.F., would help to provide a solution.15. The United Kingdom Prime Minister expressed appreciation of thedifficulty raised by the Minister. The scale and frequency of air operations made it impracticable to refer to all participants on each occasion. The UnitedKingdom Government were conscious of the importance of adequate public reference to Dominions and other United Nations forces, and had, for example,given perhaps undue prominence to the Australian and New Zealand armies in middle Eastern campaigns. This in turn created other difficulties. The position was further complicated by the need for suitable recognition of the contribution of the United States Air Forces.If the Minister would let him have a note on the subject he would be glad totake the matter up in London with a view to seeing that suitable reference wasmade to Canadian and other Dominions&apos; participation in specific operations whichhad a marked significance.16. It ivas agreed that a note of the matters mentioned by the Minister becommunicated to Mr. .Churchill for subsequent consideration with the UnitedKingdom Air Ministry.Sicilian Operation;  Canadian participation;  Communiques.17.   The  United Kingdom Prime Minister referred to the difficulties experienced in including reference to Canadian participation in the earlyannouncements of the operations.[25992] B 2
The United Kingdom Government had not been less anxious to meet theCanadian request than the United States Government. It bad been possibleto obtain earlier agreement from Washington solely because of the greater easeand speed of communication.Difficulties of this nature were bound to arise in connection with communi-ques requiring approval of several authorities, particularly where, for securityreasons, they had to be issued on short notice. Further misunderstandings ofthis kind might be avoided if Mr. King were to communicate with him by telephone, wherever he might be.18. The Canadian Prime Minister reviewed the events leading up to theissue of the initial communiques and explained the importance, from theCanadian viewpoint, of including reference to Canadian participation. since no assurance had been obtained from London by the preceding Thursday night(when it was thought that the landing might take place), and since the firstannouncement was to be made by General Eisenhower, he had then communicateddirect with President Roosevelt.Anti-submarine Warfare;  Monthly Statements.19. The Canadian Prime Minister referred to the proposal for the issuingof regular Anglo-American statements on the progress of anti-submarine warfare.It had been assumed that these statements would refer, in particular, to theNorth Atlantic, though this did not now appear to be the intention. The R.C.N.were responsible for a substantial proportion of convoying in the North atlantic area and it appeared to the Canadian Government that statements of the kindit was proposed to issue should take account of that fact.20. The United Kingdom Prime Minister stated that the purpose of theproposal for regular release of information, which had originated with president roosevelt, was the desire to stop confusion which resulted from frequentfragmentary statements coming from various sources.The joint statements to be issued would deal with anti-submarine warfarein all theatres of action and he now intended to propose to the President thatthey contain reference to the fact that they were issued after consultation withthe Canadian Department of National Defence for Naval Services.21. It was agreed that the reference in the joint statements proposed byMr. Churchill would meet the situation adequately.Honours and Awards; 1939-43 Star.22. The United Kingdom Prime Minister referred to previous discussions regarding conditions to attach to the award of the 1939-43 Star.This award had been intended to recognise the services of those troopswho had been in action during the critical early years of the war. unfortunately the terms of the award did not cover the majority of Canadian Army overseaswho, through no fault of their own, had been engaged during the period in the vital defence of Britain.It was hoped that the Canadian position would be met by a six months&apos;extension of the qualifying period. The United Kingdom Governmentappreciated the importance of according some appropriate recognition to troopswho had served away from home for a long period. Consideration would be givento special further extensions of the qualifying period- arid he would welcome any action by the Canadian Government to provide a special award for its ownoverseas personnel:23. The Minister of National Defence pointed out that the canadian government were not so much concerned with an award which would be availableto all Canadians overseas, but rather that the conditions of the first generaloperational award should not be such as to exclude Canadians who, as a resultof strategic exigencies, were not engaged in operations until after some arbitrarydate.The period 1939-43 was too long to have any special significance, but yet notlong enough to meet the special Canadian situation. It would be desirable toextend the period to cover 1944 as well.24. It was agreed that the Minister of National Defence review the recentUnited Kingdom White Paper on the 1939-43 Star to see if there were any modifications which could be made to meet the Canadian position, arid in
particular whether any discretionary extensions of the qualifying period couldbe made.International Civil Aviation.25. The United Kingdom Prime Minister referred to the difference ofopinion between the United Kingdom and Canadian Governments with regardto the advisability of special Commonwealth discussions, in advance of a meeting with the United States and other countries.It was difficult to see how the United States Government could reasonablytake exception to such prior Commonwealth discussions. It would be a naturaland proper thing for the nations of the Commonwealth to hold a &quot; familycouncil&apos;&apos; in such circumstances.26. The Minister of Munitions and Supply referred to the position of theUnited States air lines who were laying plans for large expansion after the war,including extensive developments northward, over Canadian territory.Under these conditions it would be unwise for Canada to embark upon anyformulation of policy with other nations, without some prior opportunity for obtaining the views of the United States Government.27. The Canadian Prime Minister said that it was the view of the canadian government that the institution of prior Commonwealth discussions, on these important questions, would create, in the United States, the impression that themembers of the Commonwealth were seeking to achieve a common policy beforeconsulting the United States Government, and would thereby prejudice the courseof any subsequent international conference and the hope of achieving asatisfactory result.This was true in other fields of post-war policy, as well as in civil aviation.28. Mr. Churchill said that he had recently made international air transport his own special concern. It was his intention to hold preliminary discussions on the subject with the President. During the coming week Mr. Kingwould participate with him in discussing the subject with Mr. Roosevelt.The United Kingdom Government and other members of the Commonwealthwere, however, anxious to have exploratory discussions among themselves. Forthat reason it was intended to proceed on this basis, whether or not Canada felt able to participate.At the same time, Canada&apos;s position vis-a-vis the United States would be strengthened if members of the Commonwealth could reach common agreement.29. The Minister of Mines and Resources pointed out that Canada&apos;sreluctance to participate in Commonwealth discussions arose not so much fromfear that the United States Government itself would misunderstand the purposeof such discussions, but rather from apprehension as to the influence uponAmerican opinion and policy of the powerful private companies which controlledair transport in that country.Discussions on general post-war air policy, from which the United states were excluded, would present the private air lines with an opportunity to exertpowerful pressure which would prejudice satisfactory international negotiations on a wider basis.30. Mr. Churchill said that this was an element in the Canadian position which had not, perhaps, been appreciated by the United Kingdom Government.The Lord President of the Council would bring it to the attention of their colleagues in the War Cabinet upon his return.31. It was understood that the general question would be raised bvMr. Churchill, at Hyde Park, and be discussed further in subsequent conversa-tions between the President, Mr. Churchill and Mr. King.French Committee of National Liberation.32. The United Kingdom Prime Minister explained the difficulties that had been experienced in finding a common basis for agreement in regard torecognition of the Committee.Despite the difficulties encountered in regard to de Gaulle, there was nogainsaying his identification with the forces of French resistance. In thecircumstances, there was no object in delaying the clarification of our relationswith the Committee, and he intended to urge the President to agree to prompt
action. If agreeable to the Canadian Government, he would tell Mr. Rooseveltthat Canada was anxious for early settlement of the French position. Ifdefinitive agreement was not reached &quot;at Hyde Park, the question would be taken up during the coming week with Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. King at Quebec.33. Mr. Churchill said that he had thought of suggesting to the president that de Gaulle be invited to join them at Quebec. Would this be helpful from theCanadian point of view ?It was hoped that Canada would take no action with regard to recognitionof the Committee until agreement on common policy had been clinched with theUnited States, and that recognition would then be simultaneous and couched in similar terms.34., The Canadian War Committee were of the opinion that a visit byGeneral de Gaulle, at this time, might have a disturbing effect.35. It was agreed that no action be taken with regard to recognition of theCommittee, pending discussions between Mr. Churchill, Mr. Roosevelt andMr. King, and that recognition, when agreed upon, should be simultaneous and on similar terms.Training of French Aircrew in Canada.36. The Minister of National Defence for Air said that the canadian government had been approached with regard to the training of French aircrewin Canada. This raised questions of diversion in the allocation of aircrew quotasunder the Commonwealth Air Training Plan.37. It was agreed that the Minister confer on this subject with the UnitedKingdom Chief of the Air Staff.Further Joint Session.38,. It was agreed that a further joint session of the representatives of theUnited Kingdom War Cabinet and Canadian War Committee be held atQuebec in the near future, subsequent to the discussions between Mr. churchill and Mr. Roosevelt.The meeting adjourned at 3 p.m.&quot; A. D. P. HEENEY, Secretary.Quebec, 11th August, 1943.
