NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   Allied naval forces have continued to bombard targets on the Italianmainland and have maintained patrols off the. west coast of Italy.Shipping losses have been negligible.Four U-boats have been sunk, two possibly sunk and two probably damaged.Home Waters.2. On the night of the 18th/19th light forces attacked a sperrbrecher andan armed trawler off the Dutch coast. Both ships were damaged by gunfire andthe sperrbrecher was possibly torpedoed.  One M.T.B. was slightly damaged.On the night of the 24th/25th M.T.Bs. engaged a trawler and two largeescort ships off the Dutch coast. Two M.T.Bs. were slightly damaged and sustained two casualties.Mediterranean.3. On the 17th U.S.S. Trippe (destroyer) and three U.S. M.T.Bs. receivedthe surrender of the ^Eolian Islands from the Italian naval commander at Lipari.The W/T and cable station at Lipari, though inoperative, had not beensabotaged; the W/T station at Stromboli had been put out of action.4. Allied naval activity has consisted largely of unopposed patrolling offthe wTest coast of Italy, but a number of bombardments have been carried out.On the night of the 17th/18th U.S.S. Philadelphia (cruiser) with two U.S.destroyers bombarded bridges at Gioia Tauro, and U.S.S. Boise (cruiser) with two U.S. destroyers bombarded Palmi power substation. On the following nightH.M. cruisers Aurora and Dido with two destroyers sank seven northboundlanding craft off Scalea. On the night of the 19th /20th H.M. cruisers Siriusand Dido patrolled in the Tyrrhenian Sea, while U.S. destroyers bombardedGioia Tauro. On the following night the French destroyers Le Fantasque andLe Terrible bombarded Scalea, and on the night of the 21st/22nd they carriedout a sweep in the Tyrrhenian Sea, while five of our destroyers operated off theCalabrian coast, U.S. coastal craft patrolled off Vibo Valentia, and Britishcoastal craft operated off the toe of Italy. The coastal craft repeated their patrolson the following night but again nothing was sighted.5. H.M.S. Ulster Monarch (infantry landing ship) was bombed and set on fire off Cape Bon on the night of the 18th/19th, but was able to proceed.H.M.S. Trotibridge (destroyer), reported last week to have been torpedoed, isnow known to have been undamaged.The U.S. naval base at Gela has now been closed.During a heavy air raid on Bizerta one U.S. ship and an infantry landing craft were sunk and at least one other ship was damaged. An oil fire was started and there were heavy casualties among U.S. naval personnel.6. Twelve berths for Liberty ships are now available at Palermo. It is not intended at present to use the port of Catania for purposes of discharge; thirtylocomotives and 250 wagons were captured in working order there.7. On the 15th the Polish S/M Dzik torpedoed a 5,000-ton tanker, andtorpedoed and probably sank a 6,000-ton liner, off Bari.Black Sea.8. Russian torpedo aircraft sank a 3.000-ton ship on the 7th off the rumanian coast, and two ships of 3,000 and 6,000 tons off the Crimea on the 10th.South-West Pacific.9. On the night of the 19th/20th four U.S. destroyers destroyed one or two small Japanese ships N.E. of Vella Lavella.One enemy barge was sunk and two others damaged in the Kula Gulf by allied patrol craft during the night of the 20th/21st.On the 22nd one enemy cruiser and three destroyers were sighted off the east coast of Buka on a southerly course.During the night of the 22nd/23rd seven U.S. destroyers engaged two small ships north of Vella Lavella and sank twro barges S. W. of Choiseul.
On the 23rd four U.S. destroyers carried out a sweep in Huon Gulf (Papua)and bombarded targets in the Finschhafen area.Convoy movements from Japan to the S.W. Pacific continue. On the 16ththree 7,000-ton cargo ships laden with barges escorted by two destroyers were seenheading for Rabaul, and a similar convoy was seen on the same day off NewHanover.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. During the week 14 attacks on U-boats have been reported, eight by aircraft and six by ships. There have been very few sightings in the approaches to the Bay of Biscay, where air and sea patrols have been constantly maintained.Enemy-aircraft attacked two escort groups off Cape Ortegal on the 25th, and h.M.S. Bide ford (sloop) was damaged by a near miss.On the 19th a Japanese U-boat was sunk off Noumea (New Caledonia) byone of H.M. New Zealand corvettes and aircraft. Six prisoners were captured.H.M.S. Easton (destroyer) and the Greek destroyer Pindos sank a German U-boat off Pantelleria on the 22nd. Some prisoners were captured. Aircraft from u.S.S. Core (auxiliary carrier) sank a U-boat in mid-Atlantic, S.W. of the Azores,on the 24th, and on the following day H.M.S. Wanderer (destroyer), escorting an outward-bound convoy, sank another N.E. of the Azores.A U-boat was possibly sunk by aircraft S. W. of Madagascar on the 20th. andon the 22nd H.M. S/M Tuna possibly sank another in the Bay of Biscay.A U-boat was probably damaged by aircraft off Gambia on the 17th, and aircraft from U.S.S. Core probably damaged another S.W. of the Azores onthe 24th.Enemy Intelligence.U-boats.11. The number of U-boats at sea is appreciably smaller than of late, andthere is no sign of any at present off Brazil, in the Caribbean, or off theU.S. eastern seaboard. The North Atlantic also remains entirely quiet. Thereare indications that a fresh group of U-boats may have reached the Capetownarea.Enemy Attack on Shipping.12. Except for one ship torpedoed off Palermo which subsequently reachedBizerta no ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during the week.During an air raid on Palermo on the 23rd two U.S. small craft were destroyed and a British ship Avas damaged. A U.S. tanker was damaged in an air raid on Augusta on the 24th.The ships reported in last week&apos;s Resume to have been torpedoed in a home-ward bound convoy off Cape Race were later reported to have been sunk or damaged in collision and not by U-boat attack.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending the 22nd, 783 ships were convoyed. Of these,177 ships were in ocean convoys and 606 in British coastal convoys. One cruiser67 destroyers (including eight U.S. destroyers), 114 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including nine U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.Three ocean convoys, consisting of 51 ships, arrived in the United kingdom without loss.14. During the week ending the 21st, imports into the United kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 282,000 tons compared with 928,000 tons during theprevious seven days, and an average of 950,400 tons during the past ten weeks.There were no imports of mineral oil.British Minelaying.15. During the week aircraft laid mines off the Frisian Islands, off theDutch and German North Sea coasts, and off the Biscay ports.[25994] b 2
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. During the week there have been no reports of minelaying by enemysurface craft, and only one report of possible minelaying by aircraft in the thames Estuary on the 23rd.The mine totals, including those destroyed in foreign waters, are 4,448ground, 3,083 moored.Mediterranean.17.   Twenty-five moored mines have been destroyed off Augusta.Enemy Merchant Shipping.18. During the period the 16th to the 31st July six enemy ships totalling13,124 tons were sunk, all except one, which was mined, being sunk by aircraft.Four ships totalling 8,819 tons were seriously damaged. Of the ten, four ships totalling-10,100 tons were sunk and three ships totalling 6,700 tons were seriously damaged in the Mediterranean.19. The number of Vichy ships available for transference to the enemy isnearing exhaustion, and it is estimated that during the last two months not morethan 25,000 tons of dry cargo shipping has been moved to enemy ports from ports in the south of France.20. - Since the closing of the Strait of Messina the merchant shippingcontrolled by the enemy in the Mediterranean has been divided into two parts.It is estimated that about 980,000 tons of this shipping, including large liners,ships diverted to non-commercial purposes and damaged shipping, is in theWestern Mediterranean, while some 760,000 tons of shipping is in the eastern mediterranean and Black Sea.21. The two cargoes of chrome ore which were shipped from Turkish to enemy ports in July wrere the first to be sent by sea since the beginning of May.The total of chrome ore which is known to have been exported from Turkey tothe enemy between the 1st January and the 29th July is 16,897 tons, of which9,787 tons was sent by sea and the rest by rail.22. The German s.s. Gerda Toft (1,960 tons) and the tanker Bacchus(1.810 tons) from the Black Sea, have entered the ^aegean for the Piraeus withescort vessels and aircraft.The Italian tanker Celeno (3,741 tons) and an unidentified German shipentered the Dardanelles from the aegean on the 23rd.Stvedish Iron Ore.23. Recent reports have made it possible to gauge with some degree ofaccuracy the present maximum export capacity of Narvik. In the peak year of1937 the average rate of ore export was 625,000 tons a month, but damage to theport and its facilities during the Allied withdrawal rendered shipmentsimpossible for some months. Since the German occupation considerable progress has been made in reconditioning Narvik, but the present facilities, especially those for the handling of ore during the cold weather, are far more restrictedthan in peacetime, and under present conditions 250,000 tons a month is areasonable estimate of the total amount of ore which the port could handle : theexport of 234,000 tons in May last is the largest amount the Germans haveshipped.The June imports from Swedish Baltic ports have been the highest for anyJune since the war began. Precisely how Germany has been able to accomplishthis feat in spite of a decline in her shipping potential since last year it isdifficult to determine, but improvements in shipping administration, the transferof tonnage at the expense of other trades, and a reduction in timber imports fromScandinavia, have all played their part. Moreover, the mild winter enabledGermany to make advance preparations for the lifting of iron ore from Lulea assoon as the port opened on the 3rd May, and by the beginning of June shippingprogrammes had already been well established. In 1942 shipments could not be resumed until the end of May and the effects of the severe winter on shipping ingeneral had not been entirely dissipated.
New factors, directly attributable to the Allied air and sea attacks on andoff Western Germany, resulting in the lengthening of the turn round times ofshipping engaged in the Scandinavian trade suggest, however, that Germany will find it difficult to maintain this pace.The export figures for the second quarter of 1943 are as follows ; From SwedishBaltic Ports. From Narvik. Totals.Tons Tons. Tons.April      ...        408,000 155,000 563,000May       ...      1,073,000 234,000 1,307,000June      ...       1,128,000 167,000 1,295,000French Intelligence.24. Reconnaissance of Toulon on the 23rd showed that the 8&quot; cruiserA Igerie had been refloated and had entered dry dock.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad Sector.25. There is still no Russian confirmation of the continued German reportsof Russian attacks south of Lake Ladoga.Lake Ilmen Sector.26. The Germans reported Russian attacks on the 18th in the area southof Lake Ilmen but here, too, confirmation is lacking.Smolensk Sector.27. The Russians have continued to attack in this sector against strong-resistance and there has been no important change in the position.Bryansk Sector.28. After proceeding steadily for some weeks the Russian advance hasnow slowed down. This may be due to the forest country in which they arenow fighting, or to German resistance, which can be expected to stiffen as theline is straightened and Bryansk is approached. The only changes in positionduring the week have been slight Russian advances which have brought themto within 20 miles of Bryansk from the north-east and east.Kharkov Sector.29. The heaviest fighting of the week has taken place in this sector. After-being held up by German counter-attacks between the 13th and 17th, the Russiansresumed their advance in the area south of Sumy. They advanced some 20 miles,capturing Lebedin, and further south crossed the River Vorskla and reached a point 30 miles due north of Poltava. Meanwhile, they were maintaining their pressure on Kharkov itself, closing in on the city from three sides, and on the23rd it was once again in Russian hands. The Russians are now continuing their pressure south-westwards from the city.Donetz Sector. . .30. The Russians have made local attacks from their bridgeheads at Izyumand Slavyansk. No important progress has so far been reported, but the Germansadmit that on the 22nd the Russians made &quot; fairly small &quot; penetrations nearIzyum, which they claim to have sealed off-.Mius Sector.31. On this sector, too, the Russians have been attacking and have made aconsiderable advance in the area west of Kuibyshevo, reaching the railwayGoiiovka-Taganrog, 48 miles N.N.W. of the latter town.
Burma.32.   In Arakan the Japanese have reinforced their forward positions.In Upper Burma approximately 100 Japanese are moving northwards, some27 miles south of Ledo.The main Assam trunk road was closed on the 18th by floods near Jorhat, but was reopened to traffic two days later.South-West Pacific Area.New Guinea.33. Between the 18th and 21st the Japanese were driven out of their positions about Komiatum, Orodubi and Mount Tambu, south of Salamaua. Theyhave also abandoned the airfield one mile south-west of Salamaua, and are now established on the inner defence line of that place. Australian and U.S. forces have advanced across the Francisco River.Solomons.34. U.S. forces are continuing their pressure against the Japanese atBairoko on the north-west coast of New Georgia.Fighting continues on Vella Lavella Island, in the New Georgia Group,where U.S. forces landed last week. Although the original garrison was verysmall, the Japanese are attempting to reinforce by sea from Kolombangara.North Pacific Area.A leutians.35. On the 15th U.S. and Canadian forces landed on Kiska Island, which lies about 180 miles east of Attu. The Japanese garrison, which was estimatedat 10,000, had been evacuated under cover of fog before the Allied forces landed.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Bomber Command aircraft made heavy night attacks on Berlin andLeverkusen.Day bombers were active against airfields in the Low Countries and northern france.The railway system near Naples and in South Italy was extensively bombed.United Kingdom.37. The only enemy activity overland consisted of operations on two nights,when, on each occasion, ten aircraft crossed the East Anglian coast; Mosquitoesdestroyed seven and damaged another.Home Waters.38. Little enemy shipping has been sighted by day but, in the small numberof attacks made, two armed trawlers, two barges and an escort vessel were damaged. At night, R.P. Hurricanes sank a minesweeper and an R-boat and damaged two more R-boats and a coaster; a &quot;Whirlwind bomber probably sank an armed trawler.From the week&apos;s operations, which included a number of combats in the bay of Biscay area, 13 aircraft are missing and a Sunderland crashed in Eire; two enemy aircraft were destroyed and five were damaged.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 195 were despatched, laid 407 sea-mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.39. Heavy bombers of the U.S. with Bomber Command and medium and light bombers of the U.S. VIIIth  Support Command and of tlhe Tactical Air
Force have, in the main, concentrated their effort on enemy airfields of which thefollowing were attacked :  Date.	Airfield.	Aircraft Despatched.	Attacked Target.	Tonnage.	Missing.

Eleven Allied fighters were lost.Escorted medium and light bombers were also engaged in attacks on theDornier air frame factory at Flushing, the railway centres at Abbeville and at . Orner and a transformer station at Grand Quevilly (near Rouen). OneMitchell (B. 25) was lost.Thirteen fighter sweeps by a total of 64 squadrons were largely uneventful;three enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of four Allied fighters and a fifthwhich crashed in the sea.Attacks on enemy transport were on a small scale and resulted in damage to 15 locomotives and a number of barges.In the attack by Fortresses (B. 17) on the Messerschmitt factory atRegenburg (see last week&apos;s Resume), it has now been reported that theprovisional enemy casualties are 78 aircraft destroyed, 29 probably destroyed, and seven damaged; 23 Fortresses (B. 17) were lost. Of the bombers which flew on and landed in North Africa, 85 were despatched back to this country on the 24thand, of these, 60 attacked an aircraft construction works at Bordeaux where134 tons of bombs were dropped with &quot;fair&quot; results; four Fortresses (B. 17)are missing from this operation. ;Night.40. Bomber Command aircraft operated in force on two nights of the weekagainst Leverkusen (near Cologne) and Berlin respectively.At Leverkusen, where the target was the chemical works of the I.G. FarbenIndustrie, 417 aircraft dropped 1,690 tons of bombs. Unfortunately, a belt of heavy cloud was encountered over the target and the majority of aircraft bombedeither the estimated position or on the glow of fires. No concentration could beachieved and, in the absence of photographs, the success or otherwise of theoperation cannot be assessed. Only five bombers were lost; two enemy aircraft were destroyed.Over Berlin,. against which 727 aircraft were despatched, conditions were considerably more favourable, visibility being clear except for a slight groundhaze. The target was easily identified and the 560 aircraft which attackedachieved a good concentration of bombing. Photographs taken on the morningfollowing the attack were largely marred by smoke, but some hundred fires still burning could be identified of which about 80 were in a chain on the west fringeof a great pall of smoke which was covering most of the south of the city. Inthis operation, 1,762 tons of bombs were dropped and 11 enemy aircraft were destroyed; 56 bombers are missing and a further five crashed.Small scale attacks by Mosquitoes, of which one. is missing, were made onBrauweiler, Leverkusen, Koblenz and Hamburg and, on three occasions, on berlin.Intruder aircraft, of which 107 were despatched, attacked seven airfields and numerous trains and locomotives; one Mosquito failed to return.
sSouthern Italy.41. An intensive and sustained offensive was directed against the Italianrailway system. Aircraft of the North-West African Air Force and middle east Command attacked communications in the central sector as follows :  Dates.	Target and miles from Naples.	Total bomb tonnage.

The railway system on the east coast was dislocated by heavy attacks on the focal centre of Foggia,where the airfield was attacked and about 50 aircraft destroyed on the ground, alsosatellites which were attacked by 133 Lightnings (P. 38), 12 of which are missing.To the west, tracks radiating from Naples were blocked and one of the Rome-Salerno lines by-passing Naples was cut at the important junction of Cancello.&apos; At the beginning of the week enemy fighters reacted sharply to the attacks on and north of the Naples-Foggia line on the 19th, escorted Fortresses (B. 17)encountered about 75 German and Italian fighters and, on several other occasionsduring the first four days, interference was attempted by totals of 50 fighters.These attempts failed to prevent our formations from pressing home their attacks and proved, costly to the enemy; 183 enemy fighters were shot down and 74 moreeither destroyed or damaged over Italian rail centres alone for the loss of the26 bombers mentioned above and 21 Allied fighters. The number of enemy fighters seen during the last three days of the week showed a marked decline,except on the 25th at Foggia, where about 80 were encountered by Fortresses(B.17).Road and rail communications in Calabria were also subjected to constantraids and, early in the week, beaches between Briatica and Cape Suvero and between Paola and Sapri were heavily attacked. At night, in this sector, heavy and medium bombers dropped over 300 tons of bombs on these targets, which included the marshalling yards at Cotrone, Sapri, Castrovillari and Sibari. by day, 264 fighter-bomber sorties were flown against similar objectives. opposition in the air over Calabria was negligible.Sicily.42. On the night 22nd/23rd, over Palermo, - Beaufighters intercepted and destroyed two Ju. 88 and probably destroyed a third.Sardinia.43. Fighter-bombers attacked the airfield at Cagliari/Montserrato and dropped bombs in the Gonnessa area. Photographs taken on the 25th disclose thatthe landing areas at Elmas, Montserrato and Capoterra airfields, near Cagliari,have been made unserviceable by the enemy.
Mediterranean.Attacks on Shipping.44. On the 24th, off Sapri, 60 miles south-east of Naples, Mustangs. (A. 36)made two hits on an enemy warship which was set on fire. North-west of Romea barge was also set on fire and a schooner was sunk. A medium-sized ship was destroyed north of Vibo Valentia, Southern Italy, by Mitchells (B. 25). War-hawks (P. 40 F) left a naval vessel on fire off the Sardinian coast. Beaufighters(six of which are missing) covered wide areas in their search for suitable targets they destroyed several small ships off Crete and the Greek coast and bombeda 680-ton ship in harbour at Zante, Greece. At night, Wellingtons attacked with torpedoes an escorted ship of 3,000 tons off Bastia, Corsica.North Africa.45. On the night 18th/ 19th, Bizerta was attacked by about 40 enemy bombers; five aircraft were brought down by A.A. gun-fire and two by night-fighters.  Little attempt was made to drive home this attack.Russia.46.   News of air activity for the week ended 24th August is scanty.Russian aircraft continued to give close support to the various Russianoffensives. Their air force was heavily engaged at Kharkov, where, in addition to direct support operations, heavy night raids were made on German troop move-ments and concentrations on the 18th/19th, 21st/22nd and 23rd/24th.In addition to these attacks, bombing took place on three nights against enemy airfields and on the railway targets at Bryansk, Roslavl, Barvenkovo andDebaltsevo.South-east of Isyum activity included daylight raids on the railway stationsof Slavyansk and Krasnograd.. There is reason to suppose that the Germans have been compelled to with-draw part of their bomber and close-support forces from Kharkov to meet theRussian offensive aimed at Stalino. The opening of another major battlefield stillfurther extends the enemy air force and it is&apos; considered that the difficultyexperienced in meeting all its commitments in this theatre is great.Burma.47. In the North, fighter bombers sank several river craft at Maingkwanand hit an enemy supply dump at Tiangzup. Katha and Bhamo were attacked by medium bombers and, at the former, two river boats were sunk.In the Upper Chindwin, fighter bombers raided several enemy-occupiedvillages.Iu Central Burma, a total of 69 Mitchells (B. 25) attacked railway targets,warehouses and other objectives. At Meiktila, a bridge and enemy headquarterswere hit and 35 rolling-stock destroyed, warehouses at Myingyan were set on fire and, at Myitnge, an attack in which Liberators (B. 24) participated damaged thecentre span of, and approaches to, the bridge. Heavy bombers also attackedMeiktila and Pakokkn.In&apos;the Mayu peninsula area, enemy positions were raided by Vengeances(A. 31) and Hurricanes.Fighters, in attacks on river craft in Central Burma and the Akyab area,destroyed three and damaged at least 60 river craft.In the South, Prome was effectively attacked by eight Mitchells (B. 25), andbarracks and installations at Kyaukpyu were hit by Liberators (B. 24).Off the coast, two small freighters were sunk and another set on fire.China.48.   A total of about 100 enemy aircraft operated onHengyang area (340 miles N.N W. &quot;-8^* of one Kit&quot;&quot;and probably destroyed a further five ot tne enemy 101hawk (P. 40).
Pacific Zone.New Guinea.49. Attacks on airfields and shipping, in the Wewak area were made on three occasions by a total of 112 escorted heavy and medium bombers; about 80enemy aircraft on the ground were either destroyed or damaged, four small ships were set On fire, many barges sunk and, in combat, 80 enemy aircraft were destroyed and others damaged. Two Allied bombers and four fighters are missing.Enemy road communications in the Bogadyim area were bombed by 11Fortresses (B. 17) and small scale attacks were made on enemy positions and avillage in the Lae-Salamaua area, the waterfront at Finschhafen, targets at the mouth of the Francisco River in the north-east of the island and on the docks atManokwari in the north-west.Celebes.50. Eleven Liberators (B. 24) bombed the Pomelaa nickel mines on the eastshore of the Gulf of Bone, starting fires in the smelting plant.Timor.51. A total of 17 medium bombers raided five villages and the town andairfield at Dilli.A fu Islands.52. Seven Beaufighters, of which two are missing, attacked the seaplanebase at Taberfane where several small craft were sunk and, in combat, two enemy aircraft were destroyed.  Kenari was bombed by seven Liberators (B. 24).Solomon Islands.53. AA. positions and storage dumps near Vila on Kolombangara Islandwere attacked by 54 escorted Allied bombers, and a further 42 escorted bombersraided landing beaches on the south-west of Vella Lavella. On Ysabel Island,the waterfront at Rekata Bay was subjected to three small scale attacks and enemy positions on Baanga Island and Arundel Island, both near Munda, were attacked by a total of 49 light bombers. Escorted fighter bombers attackedobjectives on Shorthand Island where an enemy float-plane was shot down. Fromall these operations, no outstanding results are reported.Australia.54. Eighteen enemy aircraft made a night attack on two airfields in theDarwin area.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.55. Bombs wrere dropped on two nights of the week. On the night ofthe 22nd/23rd there were minor incidents in Norfolk, East Suffolk,Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Essex and Kent, and on the following night inNorfolk and East Suffolk.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers1&quot; and tankers in Statistical Digests E and f respectively0 combining the iigures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form.^       (1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in July 1943 these comprised 38 tankers of 293,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3)).(2) These columns.give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.to

A final interpretation of photographs taken on the 26th and27th July after the attack on the 25th-26th July shows severe damage fromRuttenscheid in the south-east to the Rhein Herne canal at Vogelheim in thenorth, and from the east side of the town centre to Borbeck in the west with thecentre of damage at Krupps.Damage has been caused throughout the main Krupps Works but is mostconcentrated in the central and southern sections. No fewer than 110 out of atotal of 190 workshops and buildings have been affected in varying degree, andthe damage to the whole plant caused by this raid is as severe as the cumulativedamage caused by previous attacks.
Among the more important departments which have suffered are : The pattern-making&apos; shop destroyed over an area of approximately one acre.Machine shop covering an area of 3^ acres gutted.Another machine shop half destroyed in previous raids : destructioncompleted.A third machine shop previously damaged over a large area : furthersevere damage.Three of the four annealing shops are now nearly completely destroyed and the fourth part destroyed.The Diesel engine works covering an area of more than 3 acres totallydestroyed.Three large buildings engaged on shell forging and turning have receivedmany direct hits which have caused widespread damage.Fire has destroyed many buildings, a number of large sheds and warehousesas well as workers&apos; billets and large dumps of stores and timber. Twelve orthirteen power or generator stations and boiler houses have been damaged and several cooling towers destroyed. There has also been further damage to Kruppsharbour foundry at Vogelheim.Outside Krupps many industrial plants have been damaged, several of themseverely; these latter include T. Ff. Goldschmidt, A.G. Lead and Tin Smelters,Presswerke A.G., makers of plastics, a large brewery and an unidentifiedengineering works at Ruttenscheid.Many hits on railway tracks and sidings over the whole area have been destroyed and derailed trucks and coaches, and a number of railway stations,among which are the main Essen station and goods depot, Essen Nord and EssenWest passenger and goods station, and Bergeborbeck stations have had buildions or platforms damaged or destroyed.In addition to the great destruction to workers&apos; billets within the boundary of Krupps Works, some twenty hutted camp sites have suffered damage.Damage to business and residential property is severe and widespread, but ischiefly concentrated in the districts of Altendorf and Ffolsterhausen. Approxi-mately one-fifth of the property remaining in the built-up areas of the town hasbeen destroyed as a result of this raid.Peenemunde. Assessment of damage from photographs taken on the18th August is made difficult by patches of cloud, cloud shadow and smoke fromfires still burning in the target area. Immediate interpretation, however, showsdamage both to buildings in the experimental station and to huts for personnel to be very severe. In the north station area some 27 buildings have been completely destroyed and nine others severely damaged. In the south station area one largebuilding has been partly destroyed and another damaged. In one of the campssome 40 huts on the shore side have been completely destroyed, and about 50 others in the centre gutted by fire or partly demolished. In the south, labour camp at least23 out of some 45 large huts for personnel have been completely destroyed.Regensburg. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the17th August following the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the same day shows heavy damage to the fighter assembly factory of Messerschmitt A.G. Among the buildingsdestroyed or damaged are All of the six main workshops (five severely damaged).Final assembly shop.Gun-testing range for aircraft.Large new shop (half-destroyed).Boiler house.Main store and workshops (severe damage).Office blocks.Workshops at north-east end of factory (largely destroyed).A final interpretation of photographs taken on the 17th August confirms that heavy damage was caused all over the works of Messerschmitt A.G., of which&apos;nearly every building was affected to some degree. Of the 51 single-engine fightersseen on the airfield, 37 were in close proximity to the factory and had many cratersamong them. It can be assumed that the majority of these 37 aircraft sufferedvarying degrees of damage.Mannheim. -An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the16th August is hampered by a heavy industrial haze over parts of the area.   It
can, however, be seen that the works of Heinrich Lanz, the makers of A.F.Vs.and tank components, have been severely damaged, several buildings beingcompletely destroyed or gutted. In the south-west quarter of Mannheim damage is also seen to goods sheds and buildings at the main station, an oil storage depot,a chemical works and a Diesel engine works.An immediate interpretation of further photographs taken on the 17th and18th August reveals damage in the northern half of I.G. Farbenindustrie atLudwigshaf en.   The chief incidents are : Unidentified chemical plant comprising ten medium-sized and several small buildings 90 per cent, devastated.Large coal bunker and conveyor to bunker from dockside, severely damaged.Office and laboratory for synthetic oil plant, destroyed.At least 12 medium-sized unidentified buildings destroyed, or severely damaged.Medium-sized buildings concerned with manufacture of plastics, severely damaged by fire.Schweinfurt.
