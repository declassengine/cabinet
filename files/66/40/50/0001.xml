THIS document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September. 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 400.10th September, 1943.WAR CABINET.COMPULSORY LABOUR FOR CIVILIAN PURPOSES IN EAST AFRICA.Note by Lord Privy Seal.IN the absence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, I have been askedto place the attached. Colonial Office memorandum before my colleagues.C.Gwydyr House, 10th September, 1943.Memorandum by the Colonial Office.1. A question of some difficulty has arisen in regard to the continuedrecruitment by conscription of civilian labour in East Africa for essential war work.2. The principle of compulsory labour in East Africa for essential civilian purposes was accepted by Lord Moyne early in 1942, after much consideration,at a time when the war situation was developing- most unfavourably, and it seemed likely that further sources of food-stuffs and war supplies might be lost, and thatthe war might again be carried to the borders of East Africa. Lord Moyne&apos;s immediate concern was to ensure the maximum production of food for East Africa,itself and for the Middle East, and of certain vital raw materials, of which sisalwas one of the most important. His decision was severely criticised in parliament and was debated on the adjournment on the 26th March, 1942. One of the main points of attack was that the labour recruited under compulsion was for privateenterprises mostly owned by non-Africans. Although the introduction of compulsory labour was provided with the fullest safeguards, including the strengthening of the Government labour staffs, it has remained one of the chiefsources of criticism of our war-time administration in East Africa. It is naturalto suppose that any extension would revive and intensify this criticism. .3. Of the four East African territories, compulsion has been used only in kenya and Tanganyika. In Kenya, by March 1943, the number of conscripts had reached upwards of 15,000 out of a total civilian labour force of 240,000. LastFebruary, in consequence of serious food difficulties conscription was suspended,and. the numbers had fallen to some 6,000 by June. In July, it was resumed forthe sisal industry only, about 1,600 men a month being involved. Since then450 men have been called up for urgent work at an airfield near Mombasa, and950 for the sugar industry to meet the needs of the local military forces.In Tanganyika the resort to compulsory labour has hitherto been on a smaller scale. The maximum at any time has not exceeded .7,000. The total number of africans in civilian employment in Tanganyika in May last was 258,000.4. On the 11th July the Governor of Tanganyika reported a proposal to recruit up to 4,000 conscripts for food production on European farms in theNorthern Province, and sought approval for the extension of the maximum periodof contract from 9 months to 15. Having regard to the criticisms made inParliament, the Secretary of State was unable to approve this extension, and feltthat the time had come for a review of the whole position. He thereforeinformed the Governors of both Tanganyika and Kenya that the improvement inthe general, strategic position made it increasingly difficult to defend the principleof compulsion&apos; for Africans, and that, in order to justify its continuation, it wouldbe necessary to show that it was confined to strictly essential purposes and[26088]
effectively controlled. The Governors were asked to take the necessary steps toensure that the Secretary of State received timely notice of any fresh demands for compulsory labour, and that the case was fully established on the ground thatthe articles in question were in critical demand, and that maximum production could not otherwise be achieved. It was intimated that in any case there wouldbe much hesitation in applying compulsion to industries such as coffee, which,although the Army and the Middle East are purchasers of East African supplies,can hardly be said to be in critical demand.5. The Tanganyika Sisal Growers&apos; Association, who have not hithertoasked for compulsion, have now represented strongly that they are suffering froma serious falling off in their labour supply and that their output is likely to dropconsiderably below estimates. The War Cabinet will not need to be remindedof the importance of sisal. There is constant pressure from the United states for increased production, and it is also of prime importance to all the Alliednavies and merchant marine, now that manilla hemp is no longer available forthe manufacture of cordage. The Minister of Production will no doubt confirm that every possible means should be adopted to maintain and increase output,6. The Sisal Growers&apos; Association&apos;s demand was for 16,000 conscripts,but the Governor considers that 11,000 men would be sufficient to meet immediate requirements. On the information available it*is very difficult to test the strengthof the case put forward, but it has been suggested to the Secretary of State thatit cannot be regarded as fully established. It is also not possible to say with confidence that everything possible has been clone to provide the necessary numberson a voluntary basis, by improving the conditions of labour so as to make them more attractive. In the ordinary way an increase in the wages rate could be suggested. But an increase of wages at this juncture would have no practical effect, since it is impossible to provide East Africa with adequate supplies of consumption goods of the kind on which the African would normally spend hiswages. More importance should perhaps be attached to other improvements in conditions of employment, particularly in the matter of rations. The Growersstate, however, that the estates which are finding the greatest difficulty inobtaining labour are not those which do not provide a ration which includesmeat. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State has felt tnat there is considerablescope for enquiry in these and other directions as to whether it would not bepossible to ensure a flow of labour into essential war industries without resorting to compulsion.7. In reply to the communication mentioned in paragraph 4 above, theGovernor of Kenya has emphasised that, despite improvements in the general position, the African labour position in Kenya is most serious and is likely toget worse with the increasing demands for war production and for operationalservice works. He has avoided the resumption of compulsory recruitmentwherever possible, admitting it only in the last resort for high priority war-work, as recorded in paragraph 3 above. He confirms that, owing to the shortageof consuriiption goods and the large Army remittances circulating in the reserves,combined with the general counter-attractions of Army life, the flow of voluntarylabour for civil purposes is not likely to be appreciably stimulated by monetaryinducements. He states that as a result of the rates of wages and rations laiddown for conscript and other labour, more attention has been given to labour conditions generally than ever before. He is considering, as the most likelymeans of encouraging voluntary recruitment, an increase in the existing cerealration, and has asked for an assurance that if this should mean further importa-tion of food next year, this would be met.8. One suggestion he makes is that the Service authorities should be instructed to explore the possibility of carrying out military works departmentallywith military labour rather than with contracts for civil labour. It is proposedto take up this question with the appropriate Departments.9. The regulations in Kenya do not at present require the specific approvalof the Secretary of State for compulsory recruitment for essential industi-ies.The Governor asks that, if this is now to be required, an authoritative pronounce-irient should be made explaining why this new procedure is being adopted and thatit is being applied in East Africa generally and not in Kenya alone. Until it ispossible to abolish compulsory civilian labour altogether for war purposes in east Africa, there is some risk that any Government statement which does not goto that length would merely revive controversy. The Secretary of State does not propose, therefore, that such a statement should be made at this end.   But he
feels that it is essential for the future that he should have some more effective control than has previously been the case10. From the point of view of the general native policy o? trie ColonialOffice, the continued recruitment of Africans under compulsion for privatefarmers, even under plea of war necessity, is bound to be damaging. There is,indeed, a serious risk that, as things are at present tending, compulsion, whichwould not be tolerated under any circumstances in peace time, may come to beregarded as a ready and normal means of tiding over labour difficulties howeverarising. Moreover, as pointed out above, the Secretary of State is not satisfiedwithout further enquiry that every possible alternative means has been exhaustedof offering sufficient inducement to labour to offer itself voluntarily. At the sametime, it must be realised that to insist upon such further enquiry and the applica-tion of any alternative measures which may prove not to have been taken already,meanwhile withholding approval for further compulsory recruitment, would inevitably mean a falling off in the total labour force until such measures could have any appreciable effect, in stimulating voluntary recruitment.11. From the long-term Colonial Office point of view, the effect of conscrip-tion to provide labour for use by private employers for agricultural production is so serious that the Secretary of State would, for his part, be prepared to accept therisk of a temporary drop in production. He realises, however, that the supply departments here may consider that, especially in critical industries, such as sisaland pyrethrum, everything should be done to maintain and increase production,and that in such cases the continuation of compulsory recruitment is justified.He feels, therefore, that the War Cabinet should be invited to give a direction onthe question of principle involved.12, If the Cabinet should decide that the complete abolition of conscriptionfor war production in East Africa cannot be contemplated at this stage, theSecretary of State would propose (a) To require that all applications from East Africa for compulsory labour for such purposes must be submitted for his prior approval. At thesame time, to meet the point made by the Governor of Kenya, he would authorise a local explanation that, while the need for maximum pro-duction of war supplies makes it impracticable to dispense withcompulsion altogether in the East African territories, it will benecessary in future to limit its application to (a) urgent naval,military or air works services,- (b) industries in which the territories are producers of commodities in critical demand and maximum produc-tion cannot otherwise be achieved, and (c) other urgent civil work,e.g., on transport and communications, subject to the same conditions,and that for this purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government require that anyfurther proposals for its use must be submitted for their prior approval.(b) As regards the particular case of sisal in Tanganyika, to agree to the compulsory recruitment of up to 11,000 Africans, but for a periodof six months only, instead of twelve. At the same time, theGovernor would be instructed to report fully what alternativemeasures such as improved conditions of service, have been applied,and also what alleviation in the position may be expected from therecent suspension of recruitment for the African Auxiliary pioneer corps. It would be made clear that no compulsion beyond the figureof 11.000 would be allowed unless the Secretary of State is m aposition to satisfy Parliament that all possible alternatives have beenfully adopted. The Secretary of State is also considering whetherit will be possible, during the ensuing six months, to send out anofficer to examine the position personally on his behalf.Colonial Office, lQth September, 1943.
