THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET,REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JULY 1943 FOR THE DOMINIONS.INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND   mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.Political.GENERAL GIRAUD paid a visit to Canada during July and was warmlyreceived there. He refrained from comment on the political situation in North.Africa, and did not mention General de Gaulle nor raise officially the questionof recognition of the French Committee at Algiers. The set-up of the latter bodyis thought by Canadians to be in the main a substantial victory for de Gaulle.2. The appointment of Mr. Ray Atherton as United States Minister to canada is regarded as a very good one. Mr. Atherton presented his credentialson the 8th August.3. In Home affairs there has been some press discussion on the Govern-ment&apos;s postponement of the redistribution of electoral constituencies (which necessitated the passing of an Act in the United Kingdom Parliament to amend the British North America Act in that particular). Although considerable opposition was shown by certain sections of the population in Quebec to thepassage of the necessary Address to The King by the Canadian Parliament, this,in fact, was passed by a large majority in both Houses. The incident has,however, been regarded in some quarters as serving to impress anew the necessityfor coming to some arrangement which would relieve the United kingdom parliament of all responsibility for changing the Canadian Constitution.4. The Federal Parliamentary Session ended on the 24th July, and theHouse of Commons now stands adjourned until January. The final stages ofthe session dealt, among other things, with a War Appropriation Bill of$3,900 million. The Bill passed through all stages, as did also one to widen thescope of the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1940.5. Ontario has just held an election, and one is likely to take place inQuebec in the autumn. One of the surprising features of the Ontario electionwas the extraordinary advance of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation,,a party, run on Socialist lines, which, although it had no seats at all in the lastLegislature, now figures as the official Opposition, holding thirty-two seatsagainst thirty-seven held by the largest party, the Progressive Conservatives.The election was notable for the overwhelming defeat of the Liberals, after nine years of office, and the political grouping in Ontario is already being regarded in Canada as an outline of the eventual pattern of Federal politics. ColonelDrew, the Conservative party leader, is expected, to be the new Premier. the remarkable rise in the fortunes of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation isevidenced by the fact that.it now holds the balance of power in the Provinciallarliaments of Ontario and British Columbia, and is the official Opposition inSaskatchewan.[25967] . bSECRET.W.P. (43) 381.27^ August. 1943.
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.11. The election campaign is now in full swing. The new Parliament is to assemble not later than the 27th September. Practically the whole of the Presssupports the Opposition demand for a National Government. Dr. Evatt is also said to be in favour of a coalition and. should Labour be defeated, it is thoughtthat he may succeed Mr. Curtin as Prime Minister. Mr. Curtin himself statedthat the Labour Party would refuse to consider a coalition, and it is clear that theGovernment is to fight the election on its war record. On the one hand theGovernment claims to have saved the country, whose defences, they are claiming,were neglected by previous Governments, while, on the other, the Opposition isbusy attacking the alleged Pacifist records of present Ministers. It is clear thatthe only real issue in Australia at present is which Party, or combination of parties, will be best able to organize the most efficient prosecution of the war.Unfortunately for the Opposition, public bickering has taken place betweenMessrs. Fadden and Menzies, both members of the United Australia Party.When Mr. Menzies denied previous knowledge of Mr. Fadden&apos;s proposed post-war credit scheme, by which he has suggested that taxpayers should receive arefund of one-third of income tax paid, the refund to be retrospective to 1942,Mr. Fadden described Mr. Menzies&apos;s denial and disclaimer of support for thescheme as &quot;a stab in the back, and another of the betrayals for which mr. Menzies is notorious.&quot; The Roman Catholic attitude to the Government isinfluenced by the supposed liaison between the Labour Party and the Communists.6. In British Columbia there has been a strong demand for the return afterthe war of the numerous Japanese immigrants who originally came to that province in connexion with the fishing operations; a matter on which theProvincial authorities expect the Federal Government to give them a lead.Naval, Military and Air Activities.7. His Majesty&apos;s Canadian destroyers Athabaskan and Iroquois took partin operations in the Bay of Biscay against Spanish trawlers fishing in aprohibited area.8. The 1st Canadian Division landed successfully, with negligible losses,in the early hours of the 10th July on the south-west side of the Pachino Peninsulaat the south-eastern tip of Sicily and rapidly secured their first objective.Continuing their advance inland they captured Modica on the 12th and joinedup with the United States forces at Ragusa. Thence the Canadian Divisionstruck first northwards to Vizzini and then north-westwards, making rapid progress and capturing Grammichele on the 15th, Caltagirone on the 16th, andPiazza Armerina on the 18th. From now on enemy resistance gradually increased and some localities changed hands several times before being finally secured.Valguarnera was captured on the 19th, and in spite, of delay owing to demolitionsand mortar fire, Enna was in Canadian hands on the 20th. During the remainder of the week there was little change on the 8th Army front. Fierce fighting wasinterspersed with periods of intense patrolling, and several German counter-attacks were beaten off with heavy enemy losses; the Canadian troops were engaged in fierce and confused fighting and destroyed several tanks. On the 22nd,in spite of numerous demolitions and very difficult country, they capturedLeonforte, and on the same night finally secured Assoro after the place had changed hands several times. Determined resistance was met in the further advance towards Agira, which was still resisting on the 27th althoughsurrounded by Canadian troops; it was cleared on the 28th, and the 1st canadian division continued its advance north-eastwards, capturing Regalbuto on the29th. This place was held by the Germans with great tenacity and only fell aftersevere street fighting in which a large number of them were killed.9. Eight squadrons of the R.C.A.F. are now working with the tactical air Force in the United Kingdom. Losses during the month amounted tothirty-two bombers and five fighters, which shows a considerable decrease fromthe month of June. Eleven enemy aircraft were claimed as destroyed by R.C.A.F.fighters, one by night fighters and one by a heavy bomber of the Pathfinder Force.10. No. 424 Wellington Squadron flew 1,046 hours during the month on operations over Sicily and Italy.
The coincidence with the election campaign of price reductions in tea and potatoes, a sales tax cut, and other relaxations of war-time restrictions, hasdrawn comment about &quot; sops to the electorate.&quot;12. The Prime Minister&apos;s handling of the situation which arose as a resultof Mr. Ward&apos;s allegations about the previous Governments plan for a &quot; BrisbaneLine &quot; (reported in last month&apos;s Summary) has been very astute. The RoyalCommissioner appointed to investigate the matter found that he was debarredby parliamentary privilege, claimed by Mr. &quot;Ward, from inquiring into the source of the information on which the allegations were based. He did, however,consider himself as free to make inquiries about the supposed missing file, andthese led him to the conclusion that the official documents were indeed intact.The Prime Minister accordingly continued Mr. WarcFs suspension from the performance of his official duties until the matter has been referred to Parliament,which, owing to Mr. Ward&apos;s resort to Parliamentary privilege, is the only bodyat liberty to make a full investigation.13. The appointment of&quot;an Australian Minister to Russia, in succession toMr. Wm. Slater, is being deferred until after the election.14. On the 26th July, the Prime Minister announced a new plan to dealwith coal stoppages. This is generally regarded no more seriously than itspredecessors.15. Interest in post-war aviation continues. Australia appears to belooking to the United Kingdom for a lead, and is anxious for co-operationbetween the nations of the British Commonwealth.Naval, Military and Air Activities.16. Three more minesweeeprs for the Royal Australian Navy were launchedduring July.17. In view of the man-power position it has been found necessary to review the administrative and other services in Australia in order to supply the needs ofthe forces in New Guinea, with a consequent acceptance of risk for the defence ofthe mainland of Australia. During the next three months a progressive plan will be put into execution for the reduction of lines of communication commit-ments, anti-aircraft, coast defences, schools, &amp;c. No increases in administrativeor other units will be authorised for employment on the mainland of Australia.18. In consequence of the above policy : (a) A.I.F. personnel of the 1stAustralian motor brigade, the 3rd Australian armoured division and the 30thAustralian infantry brigade have been absorbed in formations of the 2ndAustralian Corps, (b) A reduced scale of manning of coast and anti-aircraft defences has been adopted for South Queensland, N.S.W. and the Southern Statesinvolving a wider use of Voluntary Defence . Corps and Australian Women&apos;s army Service personnel.19. United States forces in Australia now total 202,412, of which 144,132are ground troops.20. Owing to the urgent need of forestry units in New Guinea, it has beendecided to release the 2nd and 3rd companies of the Australian Forestry Group,now employed in United Kingdom, to return to Australia.        . &apos;NEW ZEALAND.21. The prospect of a general election, which is to be held on the25th September, has caused little stir. The Opposition has no major differ-ences of opinion with the Government upon the methods of waging the present war, and there is no other outstanding issue of importance.22. The press, continues to recordi the dissatisfaction of the public with government lack of action to increase the export of dairy produce to the UnitedKingdom. Its tardiness is attributed to the known opposition of the watersideworkers to the introduction of butter rationing&apos;, fin discussion of post-warprospects for New Zealand exports, anxiety is expressed about the effect on apredominantly agricultural country, such as New Zealand, of the expansion ofagriculture in the United Kingdom.   .[25967] b-2
23. The return home on leave of the famous New Zealand Division after three years of gallant service in the Middle East, has given deep satisfaction.Mr. Fraser&apos;s announcement that Parliament had agreed that the New Zealand division should be maintained in the Mediterranean theatre of war, is warmlyapproved by the overwhelming majority of the people. Returned officers of the division spoke warmly in praise of the United Kingdom troops with whom theyfought.24. The New Zealand Government are concerned over the tendency ofUnited States lend-lease officials to interfere in New Zealand domestic affairs,e.g., by questioning the distribution by the administrators of the Social SecurityScheme of drugs obtained under the lend-lease arrangements.25: Interest continues to be shown in discussions on post-war aviation.The press advocates a policy of internationalisation. In discussion of thisquestion, attention has been drawn to the war-time activities of the R.N.Z.A.E.air transport service in the Pacific Islands; it is thought that this might be incorporated in any future organisation.26. Mr. Jones, the New Zealand Minister for Defence, on his return fromthe United Kingdom and the Middle East, gave much pleasure by reportingwidespread appreciation of new Zealand&apos;s war effort overseas.Naval, Military and Air Activities.27. H.M.N.Z.S. Leander is temporarily out of service as a result of damage in action in the Pacific area.28. The Heavy Anti-Aircraft and Heavy Coast Defence regiments of the3rd New Zealand Division in New Caledonia are being relieved by United states forces; personnel of these units are remaining in the 3rd Division as reinforce-ments.29. Reinforcements of 2,000 all ranks have been approved for this division,which is being prepared for a forward move, bringing its strength up to 17,381.The Fiji native infantry battalion will not join the 3rd Division. The Fiji/New Zealand composite anti-aircraft regiment will be relieved by United states forces; personnel of these regiments will become part of the general reinforce-ment pool in New Zealand.30. A reduction to 800 New Zealand personnel is now being carried outin Norfolk Island.31. On the 1st July there were 48,233 United States army, navy and marineforces in Newr Zealand.32. Air Vice-Marshal L. M. Isitt is to succeed Air Vice-Marshal R. V.Goddard as Chief of the Air Staff.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.33. There was a temporary lull while the counting of votes in the recentelection took place. When these had been completed the result of the poll was sodramatic a victory for Field-Marshal Smuts and his policy as to have takeneven his most ardent supporters by surprise. It was indeed, a crushing defeatfor the advocates of neutrality, and decisively vindicated the war policy of thePrime Minister.The final state of the Parties was :United Party     ......      .......... 89Labour Party     ...       ... ...       ...       ... 9Dominion Party ...       ... ...       ...       ... 7Independent       ...     . ... .    ...      ...      ... 2Total Government Coalition Parties ...      ...     107Nationalist Party        ...       ...       ...       ...      43The latter lost seven seats to the United, Party, some in what were regardedas Nationalist strongholds, and one to Labour, but gained two. from the united party at Calvinia and Frankfort (Mr. Havenga&apos;s former constituency); six fromthe &quot; New Order &quot; (Pirow Group), and five from the Afrikaner (Havenga) Party.
34. The net result is that the Government has increased its parliamentarymajority from 21 to 64, or, with the three members representing native interests,to 67. 631,000 persons voted for the coalition against 361,000 for the anti-warNationalist candidates. Ninety-five per cent, of the 100,000 soldiers entitled to vote actually recorded their votes, but the Government majorities were so largethat in no single instance would the result have been effective if the soldiers&apos;votes disputed by the Nationalists had been discarded.35. All the members of the Cabinet were returned, but there was generalregret that Mr. Jansen, the much respected and able Speaker of the House,should have been defeated.36. There were some remarkable features of the polling, one being thecomplete extinction of the Afrikaner Party, and of the Communist Party, all of whose nine candidates were heavily defeated. Since Zeesen radio had beenpouring out a continuous stream of propaganda and advice to the South Africanelectors, imploring them not to vote for &quot; Smuts, Washington, London, the jews and the Bolsheviks,&quot; the final results must have been intensely disappointing tothe Germans.37. One reflection on the result of the elections is that it has finallyrepudiated the Opposition contention that support for Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;war policy was confined to the larger towns, and that the majority of Afrikanerswere against the war. The unprecedented interest taken in the election was alsoreflected in the high average (75 per cent.) of votes polled; and in some instancesthis percentage rose to 90.38. The death of the Governor-General, Sir Patrick Duncan, which tookplace during July, was everywhere lamented, and the press of both, sections ofSouth African opinion expressed the view that it will be extremely difficult tofind a successor of Sir Patrick Duncan&apos;s ability and life-long devotion to theinterests of South Africa.39. Mgr. Spellman, Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, visited the Prime Minister at Pretoria immediately after the former&apos;s arrival in theUnion from Lourenco Marques, and subsequently left on his return journey tothe United States.EIRE.40. At the first meeting of the new Dail on the 1st July, Mr. de Valerawas elected Prime Minister by 67 votes to 37. Mr. Cosgrave was proposed byGeneral MacEoin, but the decision of the Labour and Farmers&apos; parties not to oppose Mr. de Valera left Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s party with the support of only fiveindependent deputies in the division. There was practically no change in the personnel of the Government.41. Speaking in the Dail on the 7th July, Mr. Boland, the Minister ofJustice, said that in 1940 a parachutist decended in Eire. He was notcaptured for eighteen months, but plans, believed to be for the invasion of Eire,were found immediately after he had landed. Mr. Boland said that lateranother parachutist came down but was caught at once. He escaped from prison,however, and it took the police three months to re-arrest him. It was known that both parachutists had been harboured by the I.R.A.42. Commenting on the speech which the Home Secretary made in london on the 14th July Mr. de Valera said, &quot; Those who read the reported reference in the British Home Secretary&apos;s speech to the many battles which our country had fought for what it &apos; conceived &apos; to be the cause of liberty will, I think, goon to ask themselves the question : Against what country &apos; in one way or another,&apos;as Mr. Morrison puts it, had most of these battles to be fought \43. &quot; They will also ask what country is responsible for the continuing crimeof partitioning this ancient nation of Ireland, and whose is the force that atthis moment compels almost half a million of our people (including the majoritiesin South Down and South Armagh, in the comities of Tyrone and Fermanagh,and in Derry City) to endure the denial of the &apos; freedom and liberties &apos; for whichthis war in the &apos; cause of human freedom,&apos; again to quote Mr. Morrison, is beingfought.
44. &quot;The British Home Secretary may have good reason for neglectingto ask these questions, but the people in the Six Counties, who have been cutoff from the motherland, will not forget to ask them, nor will Irishmen who loveIreland, no matter where they live, ever cease -to ask them as long as Partititionremains.&quot;45. Mr. de Valera has addressed the following message to the CardinalSecretary of State, Cardinal Maglione, on the recent bombing of Rome :-&quot; I beg Your Eminence to express to His Holiness my profound sympathy with him in his great sorrow and anxieties! &apos;&apos;46.   A number of Irish Prelates referred to the attack in the course of their services. - The Bishop of Cork, in a statement read in Cork Cathedral, said,Though this bombing was called for by fanatics, the Catholic world had hopedthat the city, which is the Diocese of the Pope, the head of the Universal Church,would be spared.&quot;INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.47. Reports from both British India and the Indian States indicate that public opinion, though momentarily enlivened by the news of the landings in sicily, is generally apathetic in regard to the war and is almost entirely con-cerned with the rising scale of prices and the shortages of commodities,particularly of clothing and food. Economic difficulties have brought in theirtrain an increase in crimes against property, but the tide of lawlessness which followed the arrest of the Congress leaders in August last year and subsidedafter a Tew months shows no signs of revival.48. Once again there are no significant developments to report. No progress has been made so far in the direction of setting up Ministries in the five Provincesin which, as the result of the resignation of the Congress Ministries in 1939,the administration is carried on by the Governor under Section 93 of theGovernment of India Act. As regards the remaining six Provinces now underMinisterial Government, the Ministry formed last April in Bengal is experiencingdifficulty with the submission of its budget proposals to the Legislature and isnot yet assured of stability. The newly-formed Ministry in the North-west frontier Province has yet to face the Legislature and its fate will be affectedby the results of the impending by-elections which are to be contested by Con-gress candidates. In the Punjab there is a perceptible increase in the influenceexercised by Mr. Jinnah and the Moslem League over the Ministry, which isnot likely to be able to maintain the independent line it followed under thelate Sir Sikander Hyat Khan.49. The &quot;pegging&quot; legislation enacted in South Africa last April to check Indian &apos;&apos; encroachments &apos;&apos; in Durban and . the Transvaal is still a causeof much bitterness in India and in a debate in the Legislative Assembly at theend of the month the Government of India were urged to bring the recentlypassed Reciprocity Act into operation and to apply every sanction economic orotherwise against South Africa.External and Frontier Relations.50. Afghanistan. His Majesty\s Minister and the Soviet Ambassadormaintained their pressure on the Afghan Government on the subject of Axisintrigues and by the end of the month it was possible to record some progress towards the satisfaction of our requirements. One of the three chief leaders,whose arrest we asked for, has now been arrested, and a second, who is at presentill, will be arrested as soon as he can leave his bed. Some of the officials onour longer list of thirty-three suspects have been transferred to other districts, andthe Afghan Government have promised to maintain strict surveillance over theremainder. The Japanese engineers, of whose activities we complained, are definitely leaving the country shortly and will not be replaced. Finally, andmost important, the Afghan Government asked for safe conduct for two membersof the German Legation and one of the Italian Legation, of whose undesirable
activities they themselves had evidence. Although the Afghan Governmentformally rejected our advice that they should reduce the Legation Staffs, on thegrounds that such advice was inconsistent with their independent status, andhave represented that the German and Italian Governments are withdrawingthese members of the Legation Staffs of their own accord, nevertheless, we have achieved our object to a considerable extent and it is perhaps unnecessary to trouble unduly as to the method by which the Afghan Government have chosen to do this. Safe conduct has accordingly been granted for these three persons to leave Afghanistan via India.51. In view of the more favourable developments in these negotiations itwas considered unnecessary for Sir Francis Wylie to delay any longer his departure from Kabul, and he therefore left on the 26th July for Peshawar,where he met his successor, Mr. Squire. At his final interview with the PrimeMinister, when he took the opportunity to speak forcibly once again on the subjectof the Afghan Governments failure to deal adequately with the Axis Legations,Sir F. Wylie found that he was suffering from a sense of grievance at the factthat His Majesty&apos;s Government had never thanked him for his efforts to keepthe frontier quiet, during the war. Speaking on behalf of the whole Govern-ment of Afghanistan, the Prime Minister asked Sir F. Wylie to convey to LordLinlithgow a message in which he expressed the admiration with which theyhad watched his Excellency&apos;s statesmanlike handling of the India situationduring the last five years. He wished that he could have gone to India to congratulate his Excellency and bid him farewell, and hoped that one day itmight be possible to meet him personally and express his admiration of hisachievements in India. Mr. Squire arrived in Kabul to take over the appointmentof His Majesty&apos;s Minister on the 29th July.52. At the beginning of the month a British aeroplane which lost its wayduring a training flight, crash landed near Jalalabad. The two airmen, who are british, have been interned but have been well treated. Negotiations as to their future disposal are in progress.53. The North-West Frontier. The frontier remained quiet. In Waziristanthe Faqir of Ipi took up residence at Dare Khel on the Afghan border and backedhis call for recruits by announcing that he was prepared to pay them. Noticesdropped from the air on contiguous tribes warning them that Government wouldtake action against them if they sent contingents to join him had a restrainingeffect. Towards the end of the month the Faqir left Dare Khel and the hostilegathering dispersed. He is reported to have made little progress with his plans and the situation was regarded as satisfactory.54. His Highness Sir mond. Nasir-ul-Mulk, Mehtar of Chitral. died onthe 29th July.55. Tibet. There have been no further reports of Chinese troop movementsdirected against Tibet, Dr. Soong, now in this country, has raised the questionof Chinese suzerainty over Tibet with Mr. Eden, and has been promised amemorandum explaining our attitude in the matter. This will be on the linesnoted in last month&apos;s report, in brief, that our continued recognition of Chinesesuzerainty over Tibet is dependent on the maintenance of Tibetan autonomy.56. China, As on her outward journey, Madame Chiang Kai Shek on her return from America passed through India in an American aircraft withoutany notification of any sort being given to the Indian authorities. The Viceroyhas protested strongly against what, on this second occasion, can only be regardedas deliberate discourtesy, and has asked that a formal expression of our objectionsshould be made both to the Chinese and to the American Governments.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities,57. Military. There has been no change in the general situation in Burma.Redistribution of our forces has been completed. The general condition of landcommunications is bad and is likely to remain so during the monsoon. In Arakanand on the Assam frontier our troops maintain offensive patrolling. In onesuccessful action East of Maungdaw by two platoons of- British troops sixty-oneJapanese were killed and wounded for three British casualties.58. In the Sumprabum area there has been small-scale enemy patrolactivity.   Our levies have inflicted a number of casualties.
59. Experience in Arakan has demonstrated that Indian recruits require a longer period of training, including some time in a jungle warfare trainingarea. It is considered that the best method of organising this training is theprovision of training formations complete with Commanders and Staffs in whichrecruits would spend two-three months after completion of their course at a training centre. In order to find necessary reinforcements now and to make Upfor the time lag caused by extending the period of recruit training by threemonths, it is proposed to withdraw two divisions from the Order of Battle toform the nuclei of two training formations for jungle warfare as outlined above.The Battalions forming them will not lose their identity but the bulk of theirpersonnel as it becomes trained will be used as reinforcements.60. Air. All activity has been curtailed somewhat by weather, but frequentdive bombing attacks have been carried out in the Mayu Peninsula. Akyab island was bombed by night. A/S patrols and escort sorties have been flown and long-range fighter attacks made on river craft. A large quantity of supplies havebeen dropped in the Chin Hills ai&apos;ea, to which regular supply by road is not nowfeasible owing to weather conditions.61. The R.A.F. are now using American Vultee Vengeance dive-bomberswith excellent results against small well-camouflaged targets in the jungle.62. General. Health and morale of all three services continue to be generally good. Malaria, however, continues to be a serious factor to be reckonedwrith on the Burma front. Systematic efforts are being made to offset any badeffects of the failure of the recent Arakan operations and to eradicate any falseand exaggerated ideas of Japanese prowess.63. The Army intake of recruits for May was 52,000, not 49,000 as givenin last month&apos;s Summary, and for June was 53,000. The LAP. is expandingrapidly.&quot; The number of airmen recruited in March 1943 was nearly 600 per cent,higher than the average monthly intake throughout 1942. Bengal, Bihar, theUnited Provinces, Bombay and Madras are all providing large numbers of recruits. Not only the quantity but also the quality of recruits is improving.Many more men of good family and college education are entering the ranks.64. Chinese troops under training in India now number 35,930. Furthertroops are being flown in. to be trained, of whom 4,500 have arrived in N.E. Assam.65.   Women&apos;s Services in India and Ceylon now consist of the following : Indian Army Nursing Service :   1.452.Women&apos;s Auxiliary Corps (India) :  406 Officers; 5.614 O.Rs.Ceylon A.T.C. : 3 Officers; 83 O.Rs.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.66. Occupied Burma. The chief event is the declaration of &quot; indepen-dence &quot; by the puppet Government of Burma on the 1st August. According to japanese broadcasts the Japanese military administration, which existed parallel with the Burmese puppet Government, has been dissolved and Dr. Ba Maw hasbecome Premier and head of the State. The new Government was inaugurated bythe &quot; Independence Preparatory Committee &quot; (see report for May) and is pro-visional pending the formation of Burma&apos;s new national constitution.. The )Government consists of a Cabinet of 16 members, largely the same individualsas constituted the earlier puppet Government, and a Privy Council of 19 members,most of whom occupied positions of some prominence under the British regime.The latter have presumably been brought in to give an air of respectability to theGovernment, but whether they are willing participants it is of course impossibleto say. The puppet Government has declared itself at war with Britain and theUnited States, and informed Axis and Neutral States of Burma&apos;s &quot; independent status,&quot; and a Japanese-Burmese alliance has been signed by Ba Maw and RenzoSawada, who arrived in Rangoon on the 26th July as a Special Envoy andAmbassador&apos;to Burma from Japan.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic A ffairs.Food Supplies.67. Ceylon-Present stocks of cereals represent about a month&apos;s consump-tion, but I fear that the level will fall during the next few weeks. In view of thedecision taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the Government of India&apos;request for 500,000 tons of wheat, it now appears improbable that Ceylon will beable to obtain any appreciable further supplies of cereals from India, at leastduring the next few months. I am. keeping the position under constant reviewwith the Minister of War Transport to try and relieve the situation by importsof wheat and flour from Australia and of rice from Egypt. Shortage, however, oftonnage &quot;at present available in the Indian Ocean area makes it inevitable, I am afraid, that Ceylon&apos;s reserves of food will fall to a low level before they can bebrought up again.68. Dr. Clyde, my Adviser on War-time Food Supplies, has spent July in ceylon, where he has been able to conduct an exhaustive examination into the localfood control arrangements. On the recommendation of Ceylom Ministers, sup-ported by the Governor, I have agreed that Dr. Clyde should return direct to thiscountry to report to me on the Ceylon position, and postpone to a later date the visits which it has been planned that he should make to other Colonies.69. Mauritius.- In my last report, I referred to a deficiency of edible oil inMauritius. This has now been met by arranging for a supply of coconut oil fromCeylon.Shipping. .70. East Africa. -The shortage of tonnage for carrying civil supplies from north America to East Africa, which has been acute for some months, has nowbeen relieved. Discussions have taken place in Washington regarding theposition, and the Ministry of War Transport have now arranged to put one vessela month on this route.71. West Africa. There has been some difficulty also in recent months in arranging sufficient space for civil cargo on American ships sailing from north america to West Africa. The difficulty arose largely because the American ship-ping lines enjoyed considerable latitude in deciding what cargoes to load and what ports to sail to, but arrangements have now been made in Washington todeal with this.General.72. In last month &apos;s report, I referred to the visits being paid to this country by Mr. C. R. Lockhart, Chairman of the East African Production and supply council, and by Mr. G. F. T. Colby, Deputy Director of Supplies, Nigeria.Exhaustive discussions regarding the supplies of textiles and other goods havetaken place with these officers, and also with Mr. Melville, Deputy Head of theBritish Colonies Supply Mission in Washington, and Mr. Stapledon, Secretary tothe West African Supply Centre, who have recently arrived. I hope to refer innext month&apos;s report to the results of these discussions.73. &apos; East A frica.- Advantage has been taken of the presence in this country of Mr. C. R. Lockhart, the Chairman of the East African Production and supply council, to discuss exhaustively with the Ministry of Supply various problems connected with the production of sisal and pyrethrum, which are tiro-entryrequired for the war effort.74. West African Cocoa. In view of the shortage of oils and fats, verymuch greater quantities of. cocoa are being lifted from the Gold Coast and nigeria, as well as from the French Cameroons, than heretofore, and it is expectedthat this tendency will continue.T259671
Civil Defence!(Reference paragraph No. 115 of the report for May.)75. Mauritius have decided that the Civil Defence Services should be worked up to a high state of efficiency before any modification in Civil defence arrangements is made. Once the organisation is really effective the Governorproposes that it should be placed on a reduced training basis.76. In the Seychelles it has been decided that the present organisation should be maintained with a relaxation of training. The works programme willbe discontinued except that existing shelters will be maintained.77. The following modifications will be made in the Tanganyika Territory.Fire fighting units will not be reduced and the static water programme will becompleted as a long term requirement. Other Civil Defence units will be kept toa minimum and no further work on shelters and the protection of buildings willbe undertaken. Existing establishments will be maintained, and routine training will be carried out to avoid disintegration.78. In Zanzibar the present organisation is being maintained, subject toslight modifications of detail and reduced training plan.Man-power.79. Owing to the competing demands of the Army and of production in theWest African Colonies -especially Nigeria the Resident Minister is of theopinion that West Africa should be relieved of the obligation to supply a fixednumber of pioneers to the Middle East Command. The man-power position in east Africa is also becoming acute, and a similar request has been received fromthe East African Governors&apos; Conference. The War Office have asked theCommander-in-Chief. Middle East to review his requirements generally and his reply is-now under examination.Ceylon.80. The Admiralty have decided that an additional graving dock forsubmarines is urgently required at Colombo. At the Admiralty&apos;s request, theGovernor has been asked to secure the co-operation of the Colombo Port Corn-mission in undertaking its construction on an agency basis. This should avoid the delays and other difficulties inherent in employing a contractor from India orthe United Kingdom.West Indies.81. Reference paragraph 117 of the report for May. Owing to the uncertainties of the future and the necessity for employing Puerto Rican troops- in the Caribbean, the United States military authorities were not prepared to1 consent to the conditions which I should like to have seen agreed to regarding the stationing of Puerto Ricans in the British West Indies. Those conditions were that Puerto Ricans should be sent to West Indian Colonies for the duration ofthe war only, and should not be posted to other Bases than those already agreedto, viz., Trinidad, British Guiana and St, Lucia, without prior consultation with-HisMajesty&apos;s Government. The United States military authorities said thatthey might be able to remove the coloured United States troops from Trinidad, for- which I had also asked, but gave no definite assurance on the matter.82.   I was not content to let matters rest here, and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador&apos; in Washington has now been asked to try and obtain agreement to the conditionsmentioned above from the United States State Department on political grounds. )Reports on individual Colonies.Palestine.; 83. There were no positive developments in local Arab politics. Lack oflocal leadership and the inability to organise on constructive lines, causes atendency to rely on neighbouring Rulers and States to champion the PalestinianArab cause. Interest in Arab unity was almost entirely subordinate to this consideration. But the educated classes were rather restless by reason of Jewishpropaganda, and in particular their attitude towards Government post-war&apos; reconstruction.
84.   Interest amongst the Jewish community was also largely focussed on the 1controversy regarding the attitude to be adopted towards the government measures for post-war reconstruction.   Whilst the greater part of the political leaders, led by Mr. Ben Gurion, opposed it, industrial and local Governmentleaders considered co-operation essential for reconstruction and development.85. There was little industrial unrest during the month, but much concern,particularly in the Jewish community, at the fact that certain military contracts have not been renewed, and others not placed in Palestine, with the prospects ofconsequential unemployment. This was reflected in the outcome of negotiationsfor revision of the industrial award, when, in spite of a rise of 30 points in theofficial index since March, the Histadruth agreed to defer consideration of payment of &apos;&apos; time-lag &apos;&apos; compensation on which they were insistent under thelast award.86.   Public security was generally satisfactory, and no serious thefts of armsand. ammuntion were reported.87.   Jewish and Arab recruiting was still very low.Malaya.88. The Colonial Office has been engaged for some time in considering the complex problems (political and administrative) with which we shall be facedon the reoccupation of our territories in the Far East, and in particular thearrangements to be made for the Civil Government of those territories when theperiod of Military Administration comes to an end.89. In association with the War Office, steps have now been taken to collectin London the principal members of a staff who, in the first instance, will fOrm the nucleus of a Military Administration to be set up in Malaya on the reoccupationof that country, and will later become the principal officers of the Civil Govern-ment. The only personnel at present being &quot;assembled (in the War Office) is asmall number of senior officers who will be engaged, under the general directionof Major-General H. JR. Hone, C.B.E., M.C. (Chief Civil Affairs Officer-Designate), in preparing plans for the organisation of that administration.Ceylon.90. After their interview with the Governor on the 28th June at which ministers seemed divided, the Governor reported that the Ceylon national congress were pressing Ministers not to proceed with drafting a new constitu-tional scheme without the authority of the State Council, and that a CongressMember had tabled a Motion to that effect.91. On the 6th July Ministers stated that they would be unable to undertake the drafting of a Constitution in terms of His Majesty&apos;s Governments declarationwithout an indication that their interpretation was in accordance with theprinciples of the declaration, and requested His Majesty&apos;s Government to statewhether or not this was the case.92. Ministers were informed that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot express definite acceptance of Ministers&apos; interpretation without detailed consideration impossible during the war, the Secretary of State saw in it nothingessentially irreconcilable with the conditions contained in His Majesty&apos;governments statement, and expressed the hope that Ministers would feel ableto reconsider their decision and proceed with the drafting of a Constitution.93. On the 17th July the Governor telegraphed, that Ministers had decidedthat His Majesty&apos;s Governments reply was sufficiently satisfactory for draftingto be proceeded with, but that if, in the course of drafting, further elucidationbecame necessary, this would be sought. The Motion by the Congress Memberwas withdrawn.Western Pacific. &apos;94. British Solomon Islands.

There was no disturbance, however, and a compromiseacceptable to both sides was arranged by the Federal Labour Office by the26th July, when the St. Kitts Trade Union ordered resumption of work.French Volunteers in Windward Islands.96. Since Martinique has rallied to the Allied cause it is not necessary to evacuate the French refugees, numbering over 3,000, to French Guiana, but theyare being returned to Martinique at once. The great majority of them havealready gone.M iscellaneous.Social Services.97. Two commissions are being set up in connection with Higher education in the Colonies.98. The general Commission, under the Chairmanship of Sir Cyril Asquith,is to consider the principles which should guide the promotion of higher educa-tion, learning and research and the development of Universities in the Colonies;and to explore means whereby Universities and other appropriate bodies in theUnited Kingdom may be able to co-operate with institutions of higher education in the Colonies in order to give effect to these principles. *99.

As the result of the Conference held at Bermuda last April, theGovernor of Jamaica was asked whether his Government could receive up to 400further refugees from Spain. It was understood that accommodation for this number was probably available in the camps already built for the Gibraltariansand for other refugees already in the Island. The Governor said that 400 morerefugees could be received on certain conditions, and the matter is now being pursued with the Ambassador in Madrid.
