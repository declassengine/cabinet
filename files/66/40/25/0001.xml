(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot; S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL / &apos;1111 1 *&quot; &quot;^ vW.P.(45)  575 COPY NO.20TH AUGUST,   1945WAR CABINETEXPEDITIONARY FORCE MESSAGESBan^andrjjn by the Postmasuor general. Both- last year and the year before, the volume of EFMtraffic during the Christmas period was many times greater thanthe amount which could he handled telegraphically with theavailable equipment,,     Consequently last year   a million -messages had to be sent by aircraft, which meant that thesenders paid Ss* 6dc for a worse service than they could have got for 6d. by air-letter,2. There is :.:o doubt that, unless steps are taken to stopit, this situation,will recur in an aggravated form thisChristmas*     The possible alternatives are two03, First, the service might be suspended on the lines proposed by the Imperial Communications Committee in W.P.(43)356.If this is approved,  it would be practicable to limit the suspension of EFM messages to those addressed to troops in thenearer countries, who are best served by air-letter andairgraph.      It is not practicable at this date to fixdefinitely the area to which service could be continued through-out the Christmas period, because the volume of traffic over thevarious routes may be very materially affected by troop move-ments between now and Christmas5    but it might be possible tomaintain the service to the Forces in the distant parts of theEmpiren      The actual line 03? demarcation would have to be defined according to the address - e.go EFM&apos;s might be accepted for the India Command and the East and West African Forces, butnot for the Middle East Forces or the Central MediterraneanForces.    It is probable that the service to India would be poor.4. The second alternative is to restrict the volume oftraffic artificially in some way,      To be of any use, the   -restriction would have to be very drastic, and notwithstandingprolonged and close examination, no practicable method has beenfound.      The problem is a large-scale&apos; one;    with a reasonable standard of service, less than one million EFM&apos;s in all couldbe handled telegraphically during .the three weeks Christmasperiod, but at least three millions will, it is estimated, be handed in.unless acceptance is stoppedo5. The Secretary of State for War&apos;s suggestion thatpersonal EFM messages should be freely continued, but EFMmessages of Christmas greetings stopped,  is one of the suggestions which was examined quite recently by the WarOffice.      They came to the conclusion that it was impracticable..-It has previously been considered by the Post Office,  in collaboration with, both Cable and Wireless Limited and theWar Office, and had been rejected for the same reason.

Two Subcommittees of the Imperial Communications Committee,  on both, of which the War Office was represented, have confirmedthis conclusion..      If the group of greetings messages were -eliminated from the list of standard texts,  there would still remain many Intermediary phrases which,although not includedin the group of greetings messages, could be used to serve thepurpose of a simple Christmas greeting message.      If theseintermediary phrases were not removed, the volume of trafficmight, as last year and the year before, still swamp thecircuitso      To remove them ;.;ov/evGr would involve reference tothe list by the clerks at telegraph counters in the case ofeach individual message to ensure that only permitted numbers are handed in? an arrangement which would be scarcely workable,especially at a time when the normal Christmas rush is at itshighesto6C This Christmass. new and extended cheap air-letter andairgraph services are available, andy thanks to the increasedallocation by the RCA0F,  of transport aircraft, the speed andregularity of the mails are enormously improvedo      In thesecircumstances an EFM service at 2s06d0 which is subject to heavy delay or severely restricted as regards the messages tobe sent is not worth while.      In the circumstances that will obtain this year., the Post Office cannot suggest any&apos;way bywhich it would be possible to provide at Christmas a completeEFM service worth. 2s06dc to the sender*7e       . It should be added that, with few exceptions, where an EFM can be sent to a soldier or airman overseas alternativetelegraph services are available and will remain so over the christmas period if EFMTs are suspended.      These services are(1) the special cheap &quot;Concession&quot; service which is providedby the Service Departments on a rationed basis for the nextof kin, and (2) the normal public telegraph service, which includes cheap-rate messages of various kinds - in all cases there is a &quot;deferred&quot; service at half rate and a letter-telegram service (the rates vary)c80 I am still of opinion that the suspension of the EFM&apos;for three weeks? at least for the nearer destinations,  is theonly logical way of dealing with this difficult problem,,(Intld.)
