THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECEET.0.0.8. (43) 199.   (Final.)25th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.Chiefs of Staff Committee.MILITARY PROBLEMS ARISING ON THE CESSATION OFHOSTILITIES.Note by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.1. Following on a decision of the War Cabinet* made on the 1st June,.1942, there was created a Military Sub-Committee of the Ministerial Committeeon Reconstruction Problems, the Chairman of which is the Minister without portfolio, then the Paymaster-General.2. On the 21st August, 1942, there was circulated! a directive to theMilitary Sub-Committee which had been approved by the Service Ministers andby the Chiefs of Staff. A copy of this directive is attached to this note as annex A.3. The Military Sub-Committee has done much valuable work, but the changes which have taken place in the strategic situation during the last 12months, and the experience which has been gained of its working, have suggestedthat the organisation set up a year ago requires revision, and that it is desirableto substitute a fresh directive for that issued last August. The chief difficulties with which the Sub-Committee have been confronted under the existing systemare : (a) The existing directive provides that &quot; The Sub-Committee will be underthe general direction of the Chiefs of Staff Committee through the directors of Plans, and will be on permanent loan &quot; to the Chairmanof the Ministerial Committee on Reconstruction Problems. Inpractice, neither the Chiefs of Staff nor the Directors of Plans havebeen able to give much time to the work of the sub-Committee, beingthemselves too much occupied with the more immediate problems ofthe day-to-day conduct of the war.(b) The three members of the Sub-Committee being engaged &quot;whole time&quot;in this work, have not been in day-to-day touch with the service ministries to the same extent as the officers comprising the joint planning Staff and the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.(c) The Foreign Office, although clearly one of the Departments mostinterested in the problems which will arise when hostilities cease, hasnot been represented on the Sub-Committee.4. As a result of discussions between the Service Departments, the ForeignOffice and the Minister without Portfolio, the following revised arrangements arenow proposed:  (a) The Sub-Committee will be known as the Post-Hostilities Planning Sub-Committee, and will be a Sub-Committee of the Chiefs of staff committee.(b) The Foreign Office will&apos;be invited to appoint a senior officiaf as their representative on the Sub-Committee.* W.M. (42) 70th Conclusions, Minute 5.f CCS. (42) 380.[25754] .Copy No.
(c) Service Departments will be invited to consider the desirability of&quot;strengthening their representation on the Sub-Committee with a viewto bringing it into closer touch with the current working of the service ministries.(d) The Sub-Committee&apos;s functions will be to advise the Chiefs of staff and, when required, the Ministerial Committee on Armistice terms and Civil Administration, on military issues which will affectthe policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government when hostilities cease.Its members will be collectively responsible for representing thejoint Service viewpoint in regard to strategic questions in so far as these affect the period after fighting has ended. They will act as achannel through which the Service Departments can exchange views with the Foreign Office and with the other Departments, of state concerned in the problems which will arise at the same time. On specialmatters, however, it will be necessary that the Committee should co-optrepresentatives of other Departments from time to time, e.g., theMinistry of Economic Warfare.(e) Accordingly, the primary task of the Sub-Committee will be to preparedrafts of the documents which will be required in connection with the formal suspension of hostilities with Enemy Powers, and to submitplans for the enforcement of such instruments by armistice and dis-armament commissions, inspecting officers, and the like. There willbe excluded from the sphere of the Sub-Committee those measuresregarding the control of enemy territory which properly fall withinthe responsibility of a Commander-in-Chief in the field.(/) The. Sub-Committee will carry out its duties in accordance with theinstructions given to it from time to time by Ministers or by theChiefs of Staff, and will in future report to the ministerial committee on Armistice Terms and Civil Administration orChiefs of Staff as occasion demands. The Sub-Committee will,however, be instructed to keep in close touch with the work of the ministerial Committee on Reconstruction Problems, and will beavailable to advise that Committee on military matters as and when required. The Sub-Committee will also be instructed to keep in close touch with the A.T. (E) Committee and the Directorate of Civil affairs in the War Office.(g) The Sub-Committee will further be instructed to keep themselves fully informed as to the work of the Combined Civil Affairs Committee andGeneral Strong&apos;s Committee in Washington, AMGOT at Algiers, andthe A.T. (B) Committee.(h) Liaison between the Sub-Committee and the rest of the Chiefs of staff organisation will be secured by the appointment of a joint secretaryfrom the staff of the Minister of Defence.5. A draft directive to the reconstituted Sub-Committee which it isgested should take the place of the existing directive, is attached at Annex B.(Signed) E. N. SYFRET, V.C.N.S.A. E. NYE, V.C.I.G.S.D, C. S. EVILL, V.C.A.S.Of/ices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,25th July, 1943.
&apos;3iANNEX A.The Directive* to the Military Sub-Committee of the ministerial committee on Reconstruction Problems.1. The Sub-Committee has been formed to assist the Ministerial Committeeon Reconstruction Problems and to ensure that the military issues which will affect our policy when hostilities cease receive due consideration in the deliberations of the committee.2. The Sub-Committee will be under the general direction of the Chiefs ofStaff Committee through the Directors of Plans, and will be on permanent loan to the Paymaster-General, being accommodated in his office.3. The Sub-Committee will first undertake a study of the military aspectsof lessons that may be drawn from previous attempts to secure lasting peace.Previous armistice conventions, policies and methods of disarmament and peace treaties are to be studied to this end. Consideration is also to be given to (a) pastmethods of enforcing armistice terms and disarmament agreements both in occupied and unoccupied areas, and (b) methods used to control, directly or indirectly, the administration of occupied areas.4. In the light of these lessons, the Sub-Committee is then to turn its.attention to the problems of military interest with which we are likely to be facedwhen hosilities cease. This latter study should include, for example, requirements in armistice terms; main principles of Allied Occupation in Europe and of thev administration and government of occupied areas, the problems connected withsuch occupation and the manner in which they might be solved.5. - In advising the Ministerial Committee about these and related problems,the Sub-Committee will be collectively responsible for representing the jointService viewpoint in regard to strategic questions and matters of interest to theServices generally. Individual members will be responsible for representing theinterests of their respective Service Ministries. The Sub-Committee will refermatters on which they require strategic guidance to the strategic section of theJoint Planning Staff, and will refer to the Departments concerned in Ministries inconnection with subjects affecting them.Close touch is also to be maintained with the existing interdepartmentalcommittees dealing with specialised post-war problems, e.g., the DemobilisationCommittee.- ANNEX B.(Draft.)Directive to the Post-Hostilities Planning Sub-Committee of theChiefs of Staff Committee.1. You are appointed a Sub-Committee of the Chiefs of Staff Committeefor the purpose of insuring that military issues which will affect the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom when hostilities cease aregiven due consideration. You will be collectively responsible for representing theJoint Service viewpoint in regard to post-hostilities strategic questipns, and youwill also act as a channel through which the Service Departments can exchangeviews with the Foreign Office and with other interested Departments of State.2. Your primary task will be to prepare drafts of such instruments asmay be deemed suitable for the formal suspension of hostilities with EnemyPowers, and to submit plans for the enforcement of such instruments by armistice and disarmament commissions, inspecting officers, and the like. There will be excluded from the sphere of the Sub-Committee those measures regarding thecontrol of enemy territory which properly fall within the responsibility of aCommander-in-Chief in the field.3. In preparing these draft documents you will have regard to the equiva-lent documents used in former wars and, in particular, during the war of 1914-18,and to the lessons which can be drawn from our experience of the working ofthese documents.* This is the original directive (C.O.S. (42) 380) issued on 21st August, 1942.
4. In &quot;addition to the preparation of the draft documents referred to above,you will be responsible for replying to such enquiries on military questions relating to the &quot; post-hostilities &quot; period as may from time to time be put to youby the Foreign Office or other Departments of State, by the Chiefs of staff committee, or by the Joint Planning Staff. You should also consider such post-war strategic problems as you deem to be of major importance, and consult with departments concerned with a view to ensuring that these problems are taken under examination in the manner which seems most appropriate. You will alsobe responsible for advising the Ministerial Committee on Reconstruction problems on any military questions arising in the course of. their work with a view toinsuring that those military considerations which will affect British policy whenhostilities cease, receive due consideration in the deliberations of that Committee.5. In carrying out your duties under this directive, you will maintain close touch with the three Service Departments and with the Foreign Office as well as other Government Departments so as to ensure that your work is co-co-ordinated with strategic requirements and with the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In particular, you-will keep in touch with the A.T. (E) Committee and the directorate of Civil Affairs in the War Office. You should also keep in view theimportance of seeking, through the appropriate Departments, the views of theDominions and. Colonies on matters likely to affect their interests, and similarly,though subject to the direction of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, taking into consultation American and other Allied bodies working on these problems. Inthis connection you will keep yourselves informed as far as possible of the workof the Combined Civil Affairs Committee and General Strong&apos;s Committee in washington; of AMGOT at Algiers and of the A.T. (B) Committee.6. You will be assisted by a small staff of officers drawn from the three services and by a small secretariat.Your reports will normally be made to the Chiefs of Staff Committee or to the ministerial &quot;Committee on Armistice Terms and Civil Administration.
