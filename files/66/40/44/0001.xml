Quebec Conference: Operational Decisions.1. The United Kingdom Prime Minister read, and commented upon, asummary of the operational decisions taken by the United States President and himself, and the Combined Chiefs of Staff, at the recent Quebec Conference.This summary had been prepared for the most personal and secret informationof the Dominions&apos; Prime Ministers, to each of whom a copy would be sent.2.   The War Committee noted Mr. churchill&apos;s report.Navy: British proposals for further assistance: man-power.3. The First Sea Lord, at Mr. ChurchiH&apos;s request, submitted the following-specific proposals for Canadian assistance to the Royal Navy in meeting thepresent shortage of naval man-power :  (1) one or two cruisers to be taken over by the Royal Canadian Navy, at alater date, progressive training of Canadian personnel to be arrangedmeantime;(2) two Fleet destroyers to be manned by the R.C.N. in December of thisyear, or soon after, conditions of transfer to be for subsequentdiscussion;(3) the RUN. to form a Canadian unit of three flotillas of landing craftcomplete with squadron and flotilla staffs (approximately 350 men),training, in Britain, to be completed by the spring of 1944;(4) the R.C.N. to form one Beach Commando and one Beach Signal Unit(approximately 1,000 men), training, in Britain, to be completed bythe spring of 1944; and(5) the S.C.N. to provide 120 &quot; C.W.&quot; (Commission Warrant) candidates for training, in Britain, and loan to the Royal Navy.4. Sir Dudley Pound said that these proposals had already been discussedinformally with the Chief of the Canadian Naval Staff. That concerning the cruisers was the least urgent.If the Canadian Government were willing to accept these proposals inprinciple detailed arrangements would be worked out between the admiralty and the Canadian Naval Staff.5. The Minister of National Defence for Naval Services reported that theproposals submitted had already been given preliminary study by the CanadianNaval Staff. They were inclined to the opinion that, in view of the slowing down in deliveries of escort vessels from Canadian yards, it would be possibleto meet the British requests within the limit of the present Naval programme.Approximately 2,000 men would have to be provided. If necessary, personnelrequired could be released by laying up certain of the older and obsolescentR.C.N. units. On general grounds it would be desirable to take the opportunityof adding cruiser strength to the Canadian Navy.6. The Chief of the Naval Staff said that, as a result of slowing down ofthe Canadian naval shipbuilding programme, certain enlisted personnel wouldbe available for manning British vessels. Consequently, it should be possibleto meet the Admiralty&apos;s request over the next year, without making any demandupon Canadian man-power beyond that already contained in the present naval programme. Eventually, of course, an overall increase in personnel would be involved.7. The Minister of Finance enquired whether it was intended that thevessels described in the British proposals would be transferred to Canada and,if so, upon what terms.8. Mr. Churchill felt that there would be no difficulty in that respect. he assumed that the ships would belong to Canada and that the terms of transfercould be taken into consideration in the general financial arrangements betweenthe two countries.9. The Prime Minister observed that it would be necessary to have the first sea Lord&apos;s proposals examined carefully by the War Committee in relation to theheavy man-power requirements of the Armed Forces and the demands of warand essential industry.Severe shortages of man-power in Canada, particularly in regard to theproduction of fuel and other materials, were causing the Government great anxiety. It would have to be determined whether the present requests could bemet wdthin the limits of the present Naval programme.
10 Tlie War Committee, after further discussion, agreed that theproposals submitted be referred to the Chief of the Naval Staff for detailed examination with the First Sea Lord, and subsequent report by the Ministerof National Defence for Naval Services for consideration by the War Committee.International Civil A aviation: Commonwealth Conference: Policy.11    The United Kingdom Prime Minister said that he had not had an .opportunity, since last meeting, with the War Committee, of going into thisquestion with President Roosevelt,   He intended to do so, however, during his forthcoming visit to Washington.   The Canadian Government would be kept informed of the results of these discussions.Meanwhile, the United Kingdom Government remained of the opinion that early Commonwealth discussions were an essential preliminary to any broaderinternational conference. It was unlikely that the United States Governmentwould take any exception to such a prior meeting, and he proposed to raise thepoint with Mr. Roosevelt. We could not forego our right to &quot; family &quot; councilson these matters.12. The Prime Minister pointed out that the Canadian objection to a priorCommonwealth meeting had arisen from a desire to avoid creating an unfavour-able impression in the United States which would prejudice the prospects of asatisfactory solution of these important international questions.If, in advance of any Commonwealth discussions, it were clearly understood by United States authorities that such a meeting would be informal andexploratory and that it would in no way prejudice the freedom of action of the participants, the Canadian Government would be prepared to reconsider their objections to being represented at a meeting in London.As to the locale of any subsequent international gathering, when Canadahad suggested that discussions might be held in Ottawa, it had been contemplated that they would be confined to representatives of the Commonwealth countries and the United States. Subsequently, the United Kingdom had proposed theinclusion of Soviet and, possibly, Chinese representatives (though not of other united Nations). This proposal had altered the situation. In the light of developments the Canadian Government were not prepared, at this time, to under-take the sponsoring of an international conference.13. Mr. Churchill read from a paper of the 22nd June, 1943, which contained a statement of his own provisional views on civil aviation and had beenprepared for consideration by the United Kingdom War Cabinet. He would welcome the comments of the Prime Minister upon the views therein set out.Many people felt that at present complete internationalisation was anunattainable ideal. There was much to be said for the principle of &quot; a fair field and no favour.&quot;14. The Minister of Munitions and Supply expressed the opinion thatCanadian policy should be based upon free interchange of air traffic with each country exercising a reasonable control over its own territory.A strong international board should be set up by international agreementwith powers of control and regulation.15. The War Committee, after further discussion, noted that Mr. Churchillwould, in the near future, discuss with President Roosevelt the subject of post-war international air transport and would communicate the result of these discussions to the Canadian Government, and agreed : (1) that Canada consent to be represented at a preliminary commonwealth meeting on the subject, in London, in the near future, on the under-standing that the meeting be informal and exploratorv and involve no commitment on the part of the Government, and that the nature of themeeting be fully understood, in advance, by the United StatesGovernment; and(2) that the questions of the basis and locale of any subsequent international conference stand over for subsequent consideration.Post-war international organisation. -16. The United Kingdom Prime Minister said that discussions of post-warorganisation with President Roosevelt had been of a tentative exploratorvcharacter. J[26072] - ** b 2
The United States Government were thinking along the lines of a centralagency consisting of the four Great Powers the United Kingdom, United States,China and the U.S.S.E,,. and a broader committee on which all nations would berepresented, but in which voting would be limited to regional or other groupingsof the smaller countries, with, for example, one vote for Europe and one for theDominions.These proposals were being given to the United Kingdom, unofficially, forstudy and comment, in the form of a memorandum. The Dominions would begiven full opportunity to comment on this United States paper and on any other proposals for post-war organisation which might be put forward.17. Mr. Churchill observed that these tentative proposals did not accord with his .own approach to the problem of post-war machinery. He would prefer a system of regional councils, a Council of Europe, a Council of Asia and a council in the Western Hemisphere upon which Canada would represent theCommonwealth.The restoration of a strong France was essential to the security of Europe and adequate provision would have to be made for French representation.The only firm basis for the post-war world lay in the continued close co-operation and association of the British Commonwealth and Empire with theUnited States, and the establishment of a strong and satisfactory understanding between both and Soviet Russia.18. The Prime Minister observed that, in the Canadian view, the establish-ment of machinery which created even the impression of domination by the great powers would inevitably have grave results. After the war each nation wouldbe looking to its own place in international organisation. Clearly, each could notbe given an equal voice in the councils of the nations, but some method shouldbe sought which would enable an equitable apportionment of rights, functions and responsibilities to be made. It had been possible to leave the supremedirection of the war largely in the hands of the United Kingdom and UnitedStates Governments, but the same conditions would not obtain in time of peace.19. The War Committee noted the statements of Mr. Churchill andMr. King.Employment of the Canadian Army overseas.20. The Minister of National Defence enquired as to the prospect of employing additional Canadian forces in the Mediterranean. This question hadbeen discussed at the joint meeting held on the 11th August, when he had mentioned the desirability of having a second Canadian Division and a CanadianCorps Headquarters sent to that theatre.21. The United Kingdom Prime Minister explained this question had tobe considered in relation to plans for operations against Europe. In theimmediate future the United Kingdom Government were under obligation to bring back certain forces from the Mediterranean to the British Isles. If furtherCanadian troops were to be sent out, additional British troops would have to be withdrawn.   An exchange of this kind might well be feasible.. The question would be taken up at once with the War Cabinet and the Chiefsof Staff in London and, if possible, arrangements made accordingly. If the move-ment were acceptable a request would be presented to the Canadian Government,through the usual channels.22.   The War Committee noted Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement.Honours and A wards: 1939-43 Star.23. The Minister of National Defence referred to the discussion of thissubject at the joint meeting on the 11th August.The British White Paper had since been reviewed by Canadian Militaryauthorities. Arrangements described therein met Canadian representations, inpart, but certain further modifications were desirable from the Canadian pointof view.24. Mr. Churchill said that consideration would be given to any furthersuggestions which the Minister might wish to put forward.25. The War Committee noted that the Minister of National Defence would put forward further suggestions for modification of the terms of the award of the1939-43 Star, and that these would be given careful consideration in London.
Relations with the U.S.S.R.26. The United Kingdom Prime Minister described the course of recentrelations with Soviet Russia.The U.S.S.R. had suggested to the United Kingdom Government the estab-lishment of a commission in the Mediterranean, on which Britain, the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union would be represented, to deal with problems in that area and, in particular, with immediate questions relating to the position ofItaly. In addition, the Soviet Government had proposed a meeting between thecountries, at the Foreign Secretary level, for the discussion of post-war questions.These developments should be taken as further evidence of the determination of Soviet Russia to co-operate with the United Nations in carrying the war to a successful conclusion and in settling the problems of the post-war world.27.   The War Committee noted Mr. Churchill&apos;s report.Position of Italy: Unconditional surrender.28. The United Kingdom Prime Minister described the present position,commenting upon the prospects of Italian capitulation and referring to thesituation created by the presence of German forces.29.   The War Committee noted Mr. Churchill&apos;s report.United Kingdom-Canadian discussions: Quebec Conference.30. The Prime Minister expressed the satisfaction of the Canadian Govern-ment at the opportunities which had been afforded for conferring withMr. Churchill, members of the United Kingdom Government and other british representatives, during the past few weeks, regarding problems of common interest. It had been a pleasure for the Canadian Government to be able to actas host during the Quebec Conference.31. Mr. Churchill extended his &quot;thanks to Mr. King and the canadian government for the hospitality offered during the Conference.Communique.32. It was agreed that a communique be issued to the Press immediately upon adjournment, the terms to be settled by the Secretary and General Ismay.(Press Release, Quebec, 31st August, 1943.)The meeting adjourned at 4.40 p.m.A. D. P. HEENEY,Secretary.Quebec, 31st August. 1943.
