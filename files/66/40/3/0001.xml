THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.The circulation of this papej; has been strictly limited.   It is issued for the personal use of.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 353. \/31st July, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE FALL OF MUSSOLINI.Memorandum by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.(Covering an amended version of W.P. (43) 339.)I have received from the President a telegram containing certain amendments which he wishes to make in my Memorandum of Monday, the 26th July(W.P. (43) 339), which was endorsed by the War Cabinet and the Chiefs of theStaff Committee. It will, I think, be felt that these amendments improve the document, and it is remarkable that such complete agreement should exist. I now circulate the new document with the amendments and omissions desired by thePresident printed in heavy black type.Meanwhile I have telegraphed to the President as follows : &quot; I have not had time to consult my colleagues, but I have no doubtwhatever that our joint draft, as amended, expresses in perfect harmony the minds of our two Governments on the broad policy to be pursued. It seemsto be a case of &apos; two hearts that beat, as one.&apos;2. I suggest, if you agree, that in paragraph 6, last sentence, &apos; we &apos;should be substituted for &apos; I,&apos; and that the document becomes a jointdirective conveying the instructions of our two Governments to allauthorities charged with their execution.&quot;The two documents should be compared together, and I shall ask the Cabineton Monday to approve the revised version.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,31st July, 1943.
REVISED VERSION OF THOUGHTS ON THE FALL OF MUSSOLINI.(Amendments (underlined) and Omissions (in square brackets) desired by thePresident shown in heavy type.)1. It seems highly probable that the fall of Mussolini will involve the overthrow of the Fascist regime, and that the new Government of the King andBadoglio will seek to negotiate a separate arrangement with the Allies for an armistice. Should this prove to be the case, it will be necessary for us to make up our minds first of all upon what we want, and secondly upon the measures and conditions required to gain it for us.2. At this moment above all others, our thoughts must be concentrated upon the supreme aim, namely, the destruction of Hitler and Hitlerism [andNazi Germany]. Every military advantage arising out of the surrender of Italy(should that occur) must be sought for this purpose.3. The first of these is [in the Presidents words] the control of all italian territory and transportation against the Germans in the north and againstthe whole Balkan Peninsula, as well as the use of airfields of all kinds. this must include the surrender to our garrisons of Sardinia, the Dodecanese andCorfu, as well as of all the naval and air bases in the Italian mainland as soonas they can be taken over.4. Secondly, and of equal importance, the immediate surrender to the allies of the Italian Fleet or at least its effective demobilisation [ and paralysis ] and thedisarmament of the Italian Air and ground forces to whatever extent we findneedful and useful. The surrender of the Fleet will liberate powerful british naval forces for service in the Indian Ocean against Japan, and will be mostagreeable to the United States.5. [Also, of equal consequence, the immediate withdrawal from or surrender of all Italian forces in Corsica, the Riviera including Toulon, and the BalkanPeninsula, to wit in Yugoslavia, Albania and Greece.]5. Also of equal consequence the immediate surrender or withdrawal toItaly of all Italian Forces wherever they may be outside of Italy proper.6. Another objective of the highest importance, about which there will bepassionate feeling in the United States and Britain, is the immediate liberation of all [British] United Nations prisoners of war in Italian hands and theprevention, which can in the first instance only be by the Italians, of their being
transported northwards to Germany. We regard it as a matter of honour andhumanity to get our own flesh and blood back as soon as possible and spare them the measureless horrors of incarceration in Germany during the final stages ofthe war.7. The fate of the German troops in Italy, and particularly of those southof Rome, will probably lead to fighting between the Germans and the Italian armyand population. [We should demand their surrender, and that any ItalianGovernment with whom we can reach a settlement shall do their utmost to procurethis. It may be, however, that the German divisions will cut their way north-wards in spite of anything that the Italian armed forces are capable of doing.We should provoke this conflict as much as possible, and should not hesitate tosend troops and Air support to assist the Italians in procuring the surrender ofthe Germans south of Rome.]8. When we see how this process goes, we can take a further view aboutaction to be taken north of Rome. We should, however, try to get possessionat the earliest moment of a safe and friendly area on which we can base the wholeforward air attack upon South and Central Germany and of points on both thewest coast and east coast railways of Italy as far north as we dare. And thisis a time to dare.9. In our struggle with Hitler and the German army we cannot afford to deny ourselves any assistance that will kill Germans. The fury of the Italianpopulation [will] may now be turned against the German intruders who have, asthey will feel, brought [all] these miseries upon Italy and then come so scantilyand grudgingly to her aid. We should stimulate this process in order that thenew liberated anti-Fascist Italy shall afford us at the earliest moment a safe and friendly area on which we can base the whole forward Air attack upon South and central Germany.10. This Air attack is a new advantage of the first order, as it brings thewhole of the Mediterranean Air forces into action from a direction which turnsthe entire line of Air defences in the West, and which furthermore exposes all those centres of war production which have been increasingly developed to escape-Air attack from Great Britain. It will become urgent in the highest degree to getagents, Commandos and supplies by sea across the Adriatic into Greece, Albaniaand Yugoslavia.   It must be remembered that there are 15 German divisions in
the Balkan Peninsula of which 10 are mobile. Nevertheless once we have controlof the Italian Peninsula and of the Adriatic, and the Italian armies in the balkans withdraw or lay down their arms, it is by no means unlikely that the Hunwill be forced to withdraw northwards to the line of the Save and Danube, thusliberating Greece and other tortured countries.11. We cannot yet measure the effects of Mussolini&apos;s fall and of [an] Italiancapitulation, upon Bulgaria, Rumania and Hungary. They may be profound.In connection with this situation the collapse of Italy should fix the moment for putting the strongest pressure on Turkey to act in accordance with the spirit ofthe Alliance, and in this Britain and the United States [acting jointly orseverally ] should if possible be joined or at least supported by Russia. We believethat in any important negotiations affecting the Balkans the concurrence ofRussia should be obtained if practicable.12. [The surrender of, to quote the President, &quot;the head devil togetherwith his partners in crime &apos;&apos; must be considered an eminent object and one forwhich we should strive by all means in our power short of wrecking the immenseprospects which have been outlined in earlier paragraphs. It may be, however,that these criminals will flee into Germany or escape into Switzerland. On theother hand, they may surrender themselves or be surrendered by the ItalianGovernment. Should they fall into our hands, we ought now to decide inconsultation with the United States and after agreement with them with theU.S.S.R. what treatment should be meted out to them. Some may preferprompt&quot; execution without trial except for identification purposes. Others mayprefer that they be kept in confinement till the end of the war in Europe, andtheir fate decided together with that of other war criminals. Personally I amfairly indifferent on this matter, provided always that no solid military advan-tages are sacrificed for the sake of immediate vengeance. ]12. It is our opinion that an effort to seize the &quot; head devil &quot; in the earlyfuture would prejudice our primary objective, which is to get Italy out of thewar. We can endeavour to secure the person of the &quot;head devil&apos;&apos; and hisassistants in due time, and to then determine their individual degrees of guiltfor which &quot; the punishment should fit the Crime.&apos;&apos;
