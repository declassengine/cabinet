THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 356. N   /[Also I.C.C. (43) 34.)2nd August, 1943.WAR CABINET.EXPEDITIONARY FORCE MESSAGES.Memorandum by the Deputy Chairman of the Imperial communications committee.1. THE Imperial Communications Committee feels that the directions ofthe War Cabinet should be taken on a recommendation which they have made to suspend the acceptance of Expeditionary Force Messages during the Christmasperiod.2. Expeditionary Force Messages were instituted in February 1940 toprovide the forces overseas and their correspondents at home with a reasonablycheap telegram service. The sender is given a wide choice of standard phrases,and for a fixed charge of 2s. Qd. can send a message dealing with the majorityof personal and domestic issues. Unfortunately, the popularity of the service(some 1\ million messages were handled in 1942) has led to its being overloaded,with resultant delays in the transmission and delivery of messages.3. The Imperial Communications Committee has been able to propose anumber of remedies which, for the greater part of the year, should ensure thatthe time taken between the handing in of a message and its delivery at a decodingcentre overseas should not on an average exceed four days. Further time willelapse before the message reaches its recipient, but the position in this regardis the same for all messages, including airgraphs and telegrams. The imperial communications Committee considers that a four day standard is not unreasonable.4. The Imperial Communications Committee is, however, unable to find any remedy to ensure that the great volume of messages in the Christmas periodare handled with reasonable speed: During the three weeks at Christmas in 1942some 2\ million messages were handed in out of a total for the year of some*1\ million. The deliveries were many weeks in arrears in spite of a large propor-tion of messages being transported by air. With such delays and non-telegraphictransmission the telegram rate became quite unjustified. The situation gave riseto - considerable discontent and many complaints were received. A radicalimprovement at Christmas could only be effected if much greater communicationcapacity were available between the United Kingdom and the Dominions on theone hand and the various theatres of War on the other.5. The Imperial Communications Committee has accordingly recommendedthat to avoid a repetition of delays at Christmas, 1943, the acceptance ofExpeditionary Force Messages should be suspended for a maximum period ofthree weeks, the extent and period to be judged in the light of the circumstanceslikely to prevail at the time. This decision would, be announced well in advance,and the Post Office and the Service Departments would be asked to arrangepublicity to explain its necessity. It will be pointed out in this publicity thatExpeditionary Force Messages were originally intended for personal messages as opposed to the greeting messages which have formed the bulk of the Christmastraffic, and that for such personal messages the forces and their correspondentswill still have available the Concession Telegram service and the ordinary cheaptelegraph services, as well as the airgraph and air letter services. The imperial communications Committee, therefore, has no reason to suppose that thisproposal will give rise to any complaints of hardship. Having regard, however,to the political implications, it has thought it well to bring &quot;&quot;the matter to theattention of the War Cabinet.[25865]
6. there is one further matter which must be mentioned. A reasonablyfast service during the remainder of the year can only be assured if adequate staff are available for coding, censorship and the non-technical operations performed by Cable and Wireless, Limited. The War Office and Air Ministry are likely totake over the work of coding of addresses from the Censorship Department, inwhich case A.T.S. and W.A.A.F. would be employed. Having regard to theimportance of the service from the point of view of morale, which has beenreaffirmed by the Principal Administrative Officers&apos; Committee, the imperial communications Committee asks the War Cabinet to direct that adequate staff should be provided.7.   The War Cabinet is accordingly asked (a) To approve the principle of the suspension of the Expeditionary ForceMessage Service during the Christmas period.(b) To direct that the personnel required to operate the service during theremainder of the year to a four day standard should be provided.(Signed)      - On behalf of the Committee :H. F. C. CROOKSHANK,Deputy Chairman.Offices of the :War Cabinet, S. W. 1,2nd August, 1943.
