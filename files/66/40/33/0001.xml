THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943. iSECRET. Copy No.&apos;     &apos;     &quot; f - - -W.P. (43) 383. //&apos;27th August, 1943. ,   /WAR CABINET. /_        \/MONETARY CLEARING UNION.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. The United States Administration have accepted the proposal in w.P. (43) 321 that we should send a delegation early in September to discussArticle VII as a whole. Among the matters which will be discussed is the schemefor a Monetary Clearing Union. The United States Treasury have also issuedan invitation to us to continue our discussions on this subject with them early inSeptember.I attach a note by the Treasury setting out the position on this complicated and important subject and indicating the line which it is proposed our delegation should cake in the discussions.2. The procedure contemplated is that we should have bilateral discussions with the Americans in the hope that we shall arrive at an agreed statement of principles. If there is a substantial measure of agreement a small drafting committee will be collected in Washington, representing Russia, China, Canada,Mexico and, it is hoped, at least one European country, either Holland or Belgiumor Greece. The drafting committee will then draw up a scheme based upon the agreed principles which will be submitted at a later stage to a larger expertconference.3. The discussions between ourselves and the Americans are between officials, and neither Government will be committed to any views they may arriveat. If there is some agreement on principles between our officials and the americans, the agreement will be communicated to me before we approve our delegation taking part in the drafting committee, which will also consist of officials.But we cannot regard these discussions as an academic exercise. The whole subject has been made public and has been canvassed in the Press of both countries. If, therefore, our delegation reach agreement on principles with the americans which they can recommend us to approve provisionally for furtherconsideration at the drafting committee, we shall be taking a first step in a course which would lead probably to the formulation of an agreed and detailed inter-national scheme. This appears to me a logical and inevitable step; if we meananything by economic co-operation with the United States we must at some stagedescend from generalities or pious resolutions to more exact and difficult plans.4. There are at present differences of real substance between our standpointand that of the American Treasury as we understand it, and it is the view of myadvisers that we cannot afford to yield on some of these differences without prejudicing our financial and economic position after the war. We do not knowdefinitely how far the Americans will oppose our standpoint on one or two matters, but it is possible that they will not feel able to agree, and that a temporarystage of deadlock between us and them will be reached. This is not, in myopinion, an irreparable situation. It may indeed be advisable that if we do not agree there should be further opportunity for the grounds of the disagteement tobe exposed and maybe publicly canvassed.5. The Treasury paper sets out the story fully, but I will summarise thethree points on which it is possible that we may fail to reach agreement with the americans : .(i) Exchange rates.   We regard it as essential that countries participatingm such an important monetary scheme shall retain freedom to adjust their[25998] . &apos; B
exchange rates, so that we could meet difficulties that may arise if we find thatthe level of our costs is out of line with that of our competitors.The Americans are suspicious of our attitude on exchange rates and will wish to bring the adjustment of such rates within the supervision of the body setup to administer the international monetary clearing union scheme.I do not think a reconciliation of the two views is impossible; from a recent report of the American view it may turn out to be largely a matter of drafting.But apart from the merits of the issue it is obvious that Parliament will be critical of a scheme in which we appear to have tied our foreign exchanges,especially if it can be alleged that they are tied to the value of gold.(ii) The British Clearing Union scheme did not require any monetarycontribution from the participating States. The facilities for balancing inter-national clearing were based upon an international credit system determined inadvance by agreement.American opinion is hostile to such a scheme and it will not be acceptable.They envisage a fund created out of subscribed capital.Although for the reasons set out in the Treasury paper we believe our ownidea is more sensible, the issue of principle does not appear to be one on whichwe should refuse to meet the American point of view, subject, however, to whatis said in the next paragraph.(iii) The American scheme contemplated that a fund should be created outof subscribed gold and national currencies, together with some government securities. The administration of the fund would use gold and the currencies toprovide exchanges in order to meet the demands of the central monetary institu-tions of each country for adjusting international balances. (Both schemes onlydeal with the adjustment of balances between central monetary institutions. Theordinary international trade and the purchase of exchanges for such trade are carried on in the ordinary way.) The British scheme proposed that all inter-national clearing should be carried on through the medium of an international unit of account which would be fully acceptable by all the participating States.We must, I submit, object to the American scheme. In the first place the most recent draft of their scheme contemplates that the gold content of the subscriptionshould be substantial. This gives the whole scheme too much of a &quot; goldstandard &quot; appearance and reduces the liquid resources of the central monetaryinstitutions which they may need for their ordinary purposes. The Dominionsand the European countries would also object strongly.Moreover, for the reasons set out in paragraph 7 (a) of the Treasury paper, w7ebelieve that the American scheme for a Fund dealing in currencies might incertain circumstances work prejudicially to the exchange value of sterling andtherefore to our international trade.We propose, therefore, a compromise, that there shall be a subscription, butthat the subscription shall consist of a moderate amount of gold and, for the rest,non-negotiable Government securities. The subscription, in other wwds, will not create a fund of gold and currencies to be dealt in, but a security for the creditswhich both schemes contemplate for the member States.6. The directive proposes that our delegation should stand firm on these points. As I have said, this may lead to an apparent deadlock between us and the americans. On the other hand, it has been one of the misfortunes of these discus-sions that the Americans have not hitherto conducted them for consecutive periods of sufficient length to allow proper examination of the reasons for differences, andit is possible that in the discussions between our highly qualified delegation andthe Americans something will emerge which may meet our requirements.At any rate I am clear that within the powers laid down, and on the explicitunderstanding that they are not committing the Government to final acceptance ofany scheme, our delegation should be authorised to enter into frank and fulldiscussions with the United States Treasury on the lines proposed.K. W.Treasury Chambers, S.W 1,*     27th A ugust, 1943.
ANNEX.Memorandum by the Treasury.1. In paragraph 4 (b) of the Cabinet Paper (W.P. (43) 321) proposing thedespatch of a delegation to Washington in mid-September it was contemplated that the delegation should, among other things, enter into direct discussions withthe Americans on the Monetary Clearing Union. This proposal has now beenaccepted by the United, States Administration and it will be necessary forBritish representatives to take part in the bilateral currency discussions in the first half of September to which we have already been invited by the United states treasury. As these discussions a.nd their outcome would be of high importanceto our post-war economic plans, an outline of the present position is given below,together with proposals for the directive to our delegation.2. The impulsive procedure adopted by the American Administration hasnot produced very satisfactory results. They began by discussing the ClearingUnion scheme with us in an exploratory way, but after a few meetings these discussions were suspended and a badly drafted version uf the American plan was circulated to the United Nations. Although the circulation was confidential,there was a leakage and a detailed version of the American plan was published in this country at the same time as the publication of our own White Paper.This necessarily led at once to the formal publication of the American plan but without any preparation of their public opinion, with the result that some organsof the press, particularly in the United States, fastened rather acrimoniously ondifferences between the two schemes which are of relatively minor importance.The Debates in both Houses of Parliament here have helped to clear up anumber of misunderstandings about the significance of the whole question and since then some important and expert articles have appeared in the press ofboth countries.The Americans then invited, the United Nations to send experts to washington for a series of bilateral discussions. After&apos; these discussions hadtaken a somewhat desultory course the Americans then invited the representativesof 17 Powers who happened to be present in Washington to a conference lastingthree days. This conference was frank and began to get down to realities, but thedifference in the point of view between the British and. American representativesshowed itself, and there was a general agreement that the next step was for usto talk to the Americans, to try to hammer out agreed principles with themand then to have a small Drafting Committee which would attempt to translatethose principles into a document which might be considered by a larger conferenceof experts. The American idea of the composition of the Drafting Committeewas themselves, United Kingdom, Russia, China, Mexico, with the possibleaddition of Canada. According to our information some sort of undertaking wasalso given to the Belgian and Dutch representatives that they would be associatedwith the drafting, a point of some importance, first because those countries haverepresentatives of exceptional competence and also because the European countries will view with growing suspicion any more economic plans which are produced by the Great Powers, even if those Powers are accompanied by a minor satellitelike Mexico.At this meeting in Washington the Canadian experts produced their owntentative draft proposals for an International Exchange Union. We hadencouraged them in their desire to prepare a synthesis of the Clearing Union andStabilisation Fund plans, but we attempted, without success, to dissuade them from making their plan public until we had. had an opportunity to discuss it fully with them. The document itself, which has now been made available toParliament here, corresponds much more closely to the United States than tothe United. Kingdom scheme and although tributes have been paid to it as awork of art, it has been generally regarded by the financial press as falling short ofthe necessities of the case. In view, however, of the keen interest which theCanadian authorities Imve taken in the matter, it certainly seems desirable thatwe should endeavour to secure for them a place on the Drafting Committee.3. It may broadly be said that informed, public comment, while critical ofvarious features of both plans, has been united in believing that some plan withthese objects would greatly help the transition from war to peace, and might play a vitally important part in the development of orderly financial and commercial relations between the nations after the war.[25998] b 2,
There is, however, hostility to the idea of an international scheme on theselines among some American banking concerns, partly no doubt because theAmerican Administration appears to be backing the idea, and partly becauseAmerican banking opinion is generally extremely conservative and still holdswhat may be called gold standard values.Opposition in this country to the principle of an international scheme hasnot been noticeable, but there is some latent scepticism about the practicability ofthe idea and the prospect of establishing in one step a workable internationalinstitution with such wide responsibilities and powers. There has also been someconfusion between the problems of providing foreign exchange facilities for trade on current account and the rather distinct problems of long-term investment.The American plan has been criticised in many quarters, public and private.4. Official opinion in the British Commonwealth and among the Allies canbe summarised as follows. Canada (whose official views have been supported bytheir - Government) and Australia are very keen to see a satisfactory schemeestablished so that it can come into operation immediately after the war.South Africa also approve, but are less directly concerned because as a producer of gold they believe they are in a position to obtain foreign exchange resources and to have a regular market for their gold. India, though critical of some otheraspect of post-war economic co-operation between the nations, welcomed theBritish Clearing Union scheme. Among the European Allies there is noapparent difference of opinion as. to the objective; for some indeed, particularly those whose liquid resources are limited or have been gravely damaged by thewar, the scheme appears to be a vital necessity. France is emphatically in favourof a scheme and so are Holland and Belgium, though they are less dependent upon its early creation. Recent conversations here with the European Allies who werepresent at Washington revealed distinct support for the British way of approach to many parts of the problem, though of course they are naturally reluctant openlyto oppose American ideas.Departmental opinion in this country is unanimous both as to the need ofsuch a scheme and the general principles upon which it will be necessary to insistif this country is to agree to it. We need it for three reasons; in general it is part of our policy to move towards the political pacification of the world by economic co-operation effected through the creation of international economicinstitutions; in the second place it is clear that we and other countries will bein great need of some system for providing multilateral foreign exchangefacilities which will allow us to use what we earn by exporting to one country topay for what we buy from other countries; finally, there is likely to be so muchdisturbance in the field of international currency in the first years after the war,unless an institution of the kind contemplated is able to exercise a stabilisinginfluence, that we shall be greatly impeded in establishing our internationaleconomy on a satisfactory footing.Some temporary or occasional assistance from the United States to the main-tenance of exchange stability and the inter-convertibility of &quot;national currencieswill no doubt be required after the war. There are elements in the United states which would like to reserve this potential power as an instrument of &apos;&apos; dollardiplomacy &quot; and come to the assistance (at a suitable diplomatic price) in each particular case, but not in general. For this reason it may prove vital to a genuine diplomatic equality and independence between the former Allies thatany assistance which the world at large requires should be given, anonymouslyas it were, through an international institution, and not by specific financial aid from one Power to another. In our case a recovery of our full financial indepen-clence is vital to our general diplomatic and political authority. Fortunately, theTreasury and the State Department of the United States appear to be ready totake a broad view in this matter, and accordingly we must do our utmost to reach a genuine agreement with them on the principles and methods of an internationalscheme, provided, of course, that its terms are not inimical to our own interests.The principles of these schemes were among the first detailed proposals for economic co-operation after the war between the United States and ourselveswhich were made public. To refuse to face the issues disclosed, which includemaking the United States face them, or to go into the discussions without a sense of the importance of a successful result, in our own interests, in the interests ofour general relations with the United States, and in the interests of the other united Nations who in. this matter not only expect us to take a, lead, but have asked us to do so, believing that we understand and can represent the economic difficulties of Europe and other parts of the world, would be a futile policy; it
0141would shake our economic standing with our Allies and obviously disappointMr. Morgenthau and the American Administration.5. The American Treasury have recently distributed to CongressionalCommittees and have now published a revised draft of their plan. Like the first draft, it is in great detail, and not too intelligible. It has been produced afterthe discussions referred to in paragraph 2, and has incorporated some changes;some of these are for the better, but some, so far as we are concerned, distinctlyfor the worse. It will appear as a revised version of the American plan and not as emanating from the United Nations.But recent communications from Dr. Harry White and the United states treasury indicate that, despite the publication of this revised version of their scheme, they agree with us in thinking that the time has now come to step back from the details and to reach, if possible, an Anglo-American understanding on essential principles. As soon as such principles are agreed, it would be for theproposed hand-picked drafting committee (see paragraph 2 above) to get to workto propose something more concrete and more detailed for a general conference ofall concerned.6.   The essential American conditions appear to be the following : (a) The principle of starting off the new Institution with Subscribed Capital.This is in contrast to the &quot;banking&quot; principle proposed by the BritishClearing Union, by which the current account balances of those countries whichfind themselves in credit would furnish the resources necessary to cover the over-drafts of those countries which find themselves in debit. This has great technical and theoretical advantages. Nearly all informed critics admit that. It can be expressed more simply, which is important in a scheme that will have to obtainthe assent of Parliament and public opinion; it allows to ail participating countries international facilities without calling upon them to surrender part oftheir liquid resources to an untried institution, and it looks in the direction ofexpansionism. But it is clear that it lends itself to misrepresentation andmisunderstanding in America as being a device by which creditor countries canbe inveigled into carrying an excessive liability. Since we have to admit that theessential objects of the Plan can be attained, subject to our own essential condition stated below (7 (a)), by an alternative which is dressed up on the linesof the American Plan, we think, though with some reluctance, and our Europeanfriends agree with us, that we should give way.(b) A ceiling to the liability of a member country to grant credit to the newinstitution and the members of it which are in debit.This presents somewhat of a dilemma. Some limitation of liability willseem only reasonable to public opinion, and the absence of a limitation is not easy to defend. On the other hand, it it difficult to prescribe what is to happen tothe creditor country when it has reached its ceiling. The American Treasuryrecognise the difficulty and do not pretend to have solved it satisfactorily. they feel that in practice the ceiling will never be reached, because it will always be to everyone&apos;s interest to raise it as soon as it is being approached. This is probablytrue. At any rate, it is felt that we must accept the American view that Congresswill require a limitation of liability, and that a ceiling (at least provisional) mustbe embodied in the plan.(c) The gold-value of the dollar must not be subject to change tvithout theapproval of Congress.No difficulty in providing for this.(d) We are asked to accept $4 =   as the initial exchange rate between dollars and sterling.Clearly this does not form part of the articles of the monetary scheme itself,but provided that we reach agreement with the Americans on satisfactoryprinciples of such a scheme we ought to be willing to reassure them by acceptingin principle that our de facto rate, at present $4 to the  , might be areasonable initial rate (on the present tendency of prices in the United Statesand the United Kingdom the Americans might have difficulty in maintaining that rate).
7. Thus there appears to be nothing in the American essential conditions,as distinct from their actual latest draft, which we need stick at. They ask us inreturn to explain our own minimum requirements. It is submitted that theywould be sufficiently covered by the following : (a) The Fund must not buy or sell gold or currencies and transactions in its booksshould be limited to transferring holdings of unitas from the name of one central Bank at its request into the name of another.On this the difference between the British and American views is, at present,sharp.The Clearing Union introduced, for purposes of international clearingbetween the central monetary institutions, an international money of account for entry in the books of the Union. It is wrong to speak of this as an internationalcurrency which moves about the world. The ordinary trade of the world will becarried out in the ordinary currencies of the world. It is only the clearancesbetween the central monetary institutions which would be expressed in thisinternational unit, a unit which was to be completely acceptable to the centralmonetary institutions of all the participating countries for the purposes of clearing balances.The American scheme, on the other hand, proposed the creation in the handsof the management of a mixed collection of gold and local currencies and thesettlement of international clearing by purchase and sale of gold and currenciesas required. This conception has three grave objections, one of which we believe to be vital to our own interests. It is immensely complicated both in the articlesof association of the scheme and in working. It is restrictive in appearance. Butthe vital issue goes deeper. The fund retains a measure of discretion; it is notbound to accept currencies offered to it. Now at any time the central monetaryinstitutions of some of the countries might find themselves holding sterling toan amount in excess of their prospective needs of it. Their only way of disposing of their, surplus sterling would be to offer it to the fund. It might well be, particu-larly in the early years after the war, that there were large amounts of sterlingbeing offered to the fund. The fund might feel that it was holdins; enoughsterling and might hesitate or decline to accept it. This would immediatelyaffect the value of sterling and, as, under the general conditions for the main-tenance of exchange rates, each participating country is expected to support itsexchanges in the free exchange markets where they exist, we should be compelledto use gold to support our exchanges because the policy of the fund had putsterling at a discount.It is argued that this is not the intention, particularly in relation to a currency of such international importance as sterling. But it remains a riskand if the management of the fund adopted the ordinary banking tradition of displaying an unchallengeable liquidity, there would be the risk of hesitationor difficulty about the acceptance of sterling.Further, although the fund is in essence intended only to deal in clearingsbetween central monetary institutions, the American scheme throughout gives the fund powers to deal in various ways in markets and there is some risk thatit might develop the practice of dealing in exchanges.Thus sterling might be exposed to action by the fund which might bothprejudice our control over our own currency and affect the position of sterlingfor ordinary exchange dealings in international and imperial trade.Moreover, the existence of a discretionary power in the fund to acceptcurrencies &quot;in good standing &quot; means that from the very beginning there is a distinction in the convertibility value of the various currencies in the fund andthe primary purpose of the British scheme, that an international unit of account should be accepted by all participating countries for clearing purposes at itsfixed value, would be destroyed.To achieve purposes set out in (a) it is necessary to turn unitas into a genuineinternational &quot;money of account&quot; as was proposed for bancor. A member country would be credited in the books of the fund with an amount of unitasequal to the amount of its initial subscription and would undertake both to buyand to sell its own currency in exchange for unitas at the current rate of exchange,whenever called on to do so by the Central Bank of another member, unless eitherits stock of unitas was exhausted or its holding of unitas had reached an agreedmaximum, in which contingencies special provisions would apply. This would ensure multilateral clearing; it would also ensure that the fund itself Avas passivein relation to member currencies so long as the fund was functioning normally;
and it would allow a great simplification of what (in the latest Americanversion) is exceedingly complicated. It would also have other advantages which need not be enlarged, on here. It is believed that the European Allies would support us unanimously in endeavouring to secure this metamorphosis. the exact form it should take can wait on the proposed bilateral discussions.(b) The initial subscription must take the form of gold only in a small proportion,and the rest of the subscription must be regarded as a fixed guarantee inthe form of Government securities negotiable and available to be drawn upon only in the event of default, withdrawal or liquidation.The latest American Draft requires 30 to 50 per cent, of the subscription tobe paid in gold. Since America has more than ample gold, this means nothing to them. In our case this would require us to part with perhaps half our totalgold reserves to the new institution. Thus the fund would take away a largeproportion of what it gave. The European Allies are unanimous in rejectingthis as quite unreasonable. Apart from its actual restrictionist and deflationarytendency, public and political opinion would interpret this provision as more orless amounting to a reinforcement of the gold standard. It is submitted thatwe should regard anything on these lines as utterly unacceptable. On the otherhand, something like the much more modest gold contribution proposed in thefirst American draft (which is all that Parliament at present knows though they will soon receive the shock of the publication of the amended version) mightbe accepted.(c) The size of the Fund must be adequate.The aggregate proposed in the latest American draft remains at f 5 billions(5 thousand million dollars). But the United States Treasury indicated toSir F. Phillips that they would be ready to raise this to (say) f 10 billions.Canada has proposed $12 billions, which is a figure we could readily agree. Butwe might accept $10 billions if this is as high a total as the United states treasury feel that they can get from Congress. (The American contribution tothis would be $2 to $3 billions.)(d) Member countries must not be deprived of reasonable facility to alter theirexchange-rates hereafter if they believe that the circumstances requirethis.According to the latest American draft, after an initial period of three yearssterling would be rigidly tied to gold at a fixed rate of exchange, unless it isreleased by a three-fourths majority of the member votes. Sir F. Phillips reportedthat the United States Treasury would probably agree without difficulty toextending the three years to five years and to substituting a bare majority for athree-fourths vote. But this does not go far enough. It seems unlikely that parliament would agree to so severe a restriction of national sovereignty; andit would be surprising if this particular provision commends itself to Congress.Something much more elastic must be worked out, though in view of Americansuspicion about exchange policy, and also in our own interests, we can accept theprinciple that policy should aim at a reasonable stability of exchange rates aspart of the wider policy of stability.General Conclusions on our Policy.8. It is possible that our insistence upon a passive subscription, a moderategold content, and the use of a universal unit of account for international clearingpurposes, may create a deadlock with the Americans and at this stage a compromise on these points which would be satisfactory to us is not easy to see.An international monetary scheme on suitable lines is, in our consideredjudgment, almost a necessity for a start-up of the international economy afterthe war. But we cannot surrender what we believe to be our minimum require-ments as described above, for such a surrender might deprive us of a propercontrol of our own currency. We need not assume that a deadlock on principleswill arise, but we believe that it is in our own interests, as well as in the interestsof a scheme which would be workable and acceptable to other countries, that, ifnecessary, the possibility of a deadlock should be faced. We must be careful to choose our ground. We accept the principle of subscription in deference to american opinion.   We ought to go as far as possible to remove any anxieties
they may have about our real attitude to exchange depreciation. We need notquarrel with them about the broad principle that the country with the largestquota should have the largest vote; indeed, any wrangle about voting powers is capable of so much misrepresentation in the American press that it is certainly not worth while. We can accept their views about the quotas. If a deadlock doesarise during our discussions with the Americans no irreparable damage will havebeen done. Although it is important to make definite progress with the scheme,there is no immediate urgency for a final settlement, and the reasons behind the deadlock might have to be canvassed in a larger gathering of other Powers, anumber of which would certainly support the stand we take.9. It will, of course, be distinctly understood that our delegates, thoughempowered to assist in working out the principles of a workable scheme on theabove lines, are not empowered to commit the Government to acceptance.Parliament will again have to consider the matter and the Government must notbe tied in any way. This will also be, so we believe, the position of the Americanofficials.Directive for our Delegation.10.   Our representatives should work within the following instructions : (i) Provided that the form of subscription and the use of the resultingassets are on the lines described in 7 (a) and (&amp;) above, the principleof the limitation of liability and such parts of the American design,e.g., constitution of quotas, relation of voting powers to quotas, &amp;c,as are necessary might be regarded as recommendations that could bemade by our delegation to the Government (the changes which we are proposing as our minimum requirements make a radical alteration in the conception of the American scheme as it has at present beenmade public, though it is not so certain that the American Adminis-tration may not be willing to go a long way to meet us). If we secure these fundamental points, it is good sense and good manners to soothethe feelings-of the experts of the American Treasury by indicatingour provisional approval of the general form of the other parts of the stabilisation Fund which they have worked out in so much detail,though it may be added that many of those details will, automaticallydisappear with the changes in structure we have proposed,(ii) The size of the fund, actual or potential, must be adequate, that is notless than $10 billions ($10 thousand millions).(iii) A satisfactory formula must be worked out allowing a proper measureof retention of national sovereignty in respect both to exchange ratesand to gold of national currencies. We cannot foresee the compara-- tive price levels at which production will settle down after the waramong our competitors, and we therefore must have a right to relateour rates of exchange to the facts as they disclose themselves.(iv) During the bilateral discussions with the American Treasury the aim should be to arrive at a clear statement of agreed principles for thescheme. Before the matter is taken further to the drafting committeethe agreed principles should be communicated here for provisional approval.(v) The American plan includes a scheme for. taking over and fundingabnormal war balances. At this stage this matter should not form part of a scheme for an international monetary union which our delegation can agree to recommend. It is preferable to consider theproblem of the abnormal war balances separately and in a differentcontext.
