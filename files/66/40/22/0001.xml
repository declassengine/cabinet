(43) 372.11th August, 1943.WAR CABINET.MISSIONS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND international conferences.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.IN the absence of the Foreign Secretary I circulate to the War Cabinet aMemorandum on Missions to Foreign Countries and International Conferences.Foreign Office, 17th August, 1943.R. L.The time is approaching, if it has not already arrived, when manydepartments of His Majesty&apos;s Government will desire to send Missions for various purposes to foreign countries. It is therefore, I think, desirable that some form of procedure should be generally agreed.2. Missions may be of different kinds. They may consist of actual repre-sentatives of one or more Government Departments, or they may be of a&quot; functional &quot; character representing some special social, commercial, industrialor scientific interests. But in all cases there will clearly be&apos; one GovernmentDepartment which will be primarily interested, and this department should, i suggest, be regarded as the sponsor for all Missions which fall within its sphere,e.g., the Foreign Office will sponsor Missions by the British Council, the Ministryof Labour and National Service. Missions by the Trades Union Congress, andso on.3. It will be readily understood that, although the Mission may be sponsored by one department as suggested above, it may also concern others, e.g., a mission of the British Council whose purpose was to explore the possible widening of its activities within the educational framework of a foreign State would certainly be of interest to the Board of Education; and it therefore seems desirable thatthe sponsoring department should accept responsibility for ensuring that otherdepartments of His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully consulted as and when necessary. But the Foreign Secretary has an overriding interest in all suchMissions, since they are an aspect of foreign relations and since their success or failure may depend in large measure on the suitable timing of their arrival inthe country to be visited and the arrangements for their reception. It would therefore seem essential that the Foreign -Office should be consulted in ample time by any other department sponsoring a Mission to a foreign.country in order thatHis Majesty&apos;s representatives concerned may have timely advice of the proposed visit and the opportunity to furnish their views on the best means of ensuring theMission&apos;s success. Circumstances, moreover, might arise which would make thedespatch of a Mission to a particular country inadvisable on grounds of generalpolicy; and this is an additional reason why the Foreign Office should have as longnotice as possible in order to prevent difficulties and misunderstandings at a later stage.4. Another problem which is in some way analogous with that of Missionsto foreign countries is that of International Conferences. At one time the greatmajority of. such Conferences were concerned with the purely political aspects of12133   [25945]
foreign affairs, and were therefore the direct concern of the Foreign Office; butConferences held under the aegis of other Government Departments are likelyto become more frequent in future. The Foreign Secretary, however, has-ageneral interest in all International Conferences; and the Foreign Office has aspecial experience in the organisation of International Conferences. I there-:fore suggest here again that when any Government Department has the intentionof summoning or participating in such a Conference the Foreign Office shouldbe consulted in regard to the arrangements to be made.5. I realise that in present war conditions many Missions are sent abroadby the Service Departments and International Service Conferences may well become quite frequent. I regard all these, partly owing to the special channels of communication which are open to the Services, as falling outside the scopeof the procedure which I have suggested in the foregoing paragraphs; but I need hardly say that in such cases also the Foreign Office is, of course, alwayswilling to give such advice and assistance as is necessary.E. L.Foreign Office, 11th August, 1943.
