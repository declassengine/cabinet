THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1943.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. \\ / issued for the personal use of........MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 390.7th September, 1943.WAR CABINET.KENYA-ETHIOPIA FRONTIER TROUBLES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.ON the 19th July (War Cabinet 101 (43) ) the War Cabinet invited me tosubmit a report indicating what measures and what military forces mightbe required in order to ensure that the frontier between Kenya and Ethiopiawas effectively guarded. I had previously described the serious state of affairs which had arisen in that part of the world owing to the murderous raids into british territory by bands of Somali and other &quot; shifta &quot; (brigands) whom theEmperor&apos;s Administration in Southern Ethiopia was proving powerless tocontrol. In April 1942 a British administrative officer had been killed in anencounter with these Shifta, and in May 1943 no less than 110 British Africans,men, women and children, had been murdered in brutal fashion in their villages,and thousands of their stock looted.2. I consulted the Governor of Kenya in the light of the War Cabinet&apos;srecommendations, and I have also had the advantage of personally discussing the whole position with the G.O.C-in-C, East Africa, during his visit to thiscountry.. 3. There has been some change in the position since I described it to theCabinet, on the 19th July, in the light of the latest information then available.The dry season which set in after June is unfavourable to movement by raidingbands, and there has been a temporary lull in the incursions into British territory.The Shifta, moreover, are at present dispersed into small parties, and there isno target to which operations by any considerable force could be directed with substantial effect. There are also indications that the Ethiopian Governmentmay at last be taking the position more seriously. The Emperor has appointed a new Governor of the Boran Province with instructions to adopt a moreco-operative attitude, and there seems to be a hope that the new Governor willmake some attempt to carry out his instructions.4. All authorities are agreed that no purely defensive action which wecould take would ensure absolute protection against raids into our territory.The frontier from Lake Rudolf to Mandera is approximately 500 miles long,and General Platt&apos;s view is that to guard it effectively the normal requirementwould be one division per 100 miles, a total far in excess of his resources. even so, infiltration would not be impossible, while the disposition of small bodies ofmen in isolated posts over so wide a front, without, lateral communications for transport, would create very grave problems of supply. A further complicationis that the rainy season, which is the time when raids take place, is also thetime when military forces using mechanical transport are largely immobilised.[26050]
In General Platfs view, the guarding of the frontier would, in any case, be a police function rather than one for first-line troops. He has, however, arranged to take over certain vital police guards elsewhere in the colony, thus releasingsome 200 additional police to strengthen the existing police dispositions at the main points along the frontier; and he has also drawn up plans for enabling two battalions to be sent up to the frontier at seven to ten days&apos; notice, if there shouldbe a serious deterioration in the position and concerted action by the Shiftareach proportions that would justify military operations. Such a position may arise in October, when the raiding season should normally reopen.5. The points where these Shifta tend to concentrate are well over the abyssinian border, and any effective action to dispose permanently of this stand-ing menace to the lives and property of British tribes would have to be takenwithin the Empe.ror&apos;s territory. There are three ways in which this could bedone.(a) By the Emperor, using his own forces.   Obviously this, if it could beachieved., would be the best solution from every point of view.General Platt has informed me that he believes that the Emperor isperfectly capable, if he wishes, of stopping the trouble. His regulartroops under British officers are now reasonably efficient and histerritorials, although in a much lower category, would be useful if,and when, they are paid.(b) By British forces, in co-operation with the Abyssinians.   A plan of this nature had been put forward by the Governor of Kenya earlier thisyear, but temporarily laid aside in order to give the Emperor a chance to put his own house in order. This plan envisaged the occupationof a line of water-holes beyond the frontier along a 75-mile stretch,up to a maximum depth of some 20 miles from the present line. Thiswould give us control of the main water-holes and tracks which are used by raiding parties proceeding.south in this area. The Governorhad contemplated that we should invite the Emperor&apos;s acquiescenceand co-operation in this plan, and his agreement to our remaining inoccupation until he had disarmed and removed the Shifta and theMarehan Somalis (elements of a tribe mainly centred in italian somaliland). Such an operation would, have to be carried out with aconsiderable show of force, and the Emperor given the chance to instruct his local authorities to accept the position.(c) By British forces alone.   This would involve the carrying out ofSir Henry Moore&apos;s plan, or possibly some more extensive operation,without Abyssinian co-operation. It would in all probability lead toencounters, if not with the Abyssinian regular troops, with the less-disciplined territorials or other Abyssinian elements; and I feel thatany such step is to be avoided except as a last resort.6. The past record of the Abyssinians gives no ground for confidence thatthe improvement recently reported will be other than purely temporary. Never-theless, after full consideration, I feel that before we proceed to any drastic action we must give the Emperor one more, and last, opportunity during theforthcoming rainy season, from October onwards, to prove that his Administra-tion is capable of discharging Abyssinia&apos;s international responsibilities in this region.At the same time, I suggest that we must intensify our efforts to bring homedirectly to him the serious view which we take of the position. I would therefore propose that, if.the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agrees, His majesty should be told frankly now that we cannot allow the situation to go on indefinitely,and that we shall look to him to ensure that during the approaching season suchaction is taken in Southern Ethiopia as will effectively prevent raids into Kenyaterritory. We should indicate at the same time that, if this object is not achieved,we shall feel bound to propose to him that action should be taken in co-operation by British and Ethiopian forces to clear up the centres of trouble within theBorana Province, and that for this purpose we may find it necessary to propose the temporary occupation by British forces of a portion of territory north of thefrontier; and that, if he is not prepared to accept our co-operation in tins matter,we shall consider ourselves justified in taking independent action, if necessarynorth of the.present frontier, to secure the lives and property of Africans living in British territory.
Meanwhile the Governor of Kenya will, with the additional police at his disposal through the replacement of guards in other parts of the Colony by themilitary, strengthen the security arrangements along the frontier as far -aspossible; and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief will continue with thepreparation of plans for intervention across the frontier, if that course shouldlater on be decided upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government.7. 1 should be glad to receive the approval of the War Cabinet for the courseof action suggested in paragraph 6 of this Note.O. S.Colonial Office,7th September, 1943.
