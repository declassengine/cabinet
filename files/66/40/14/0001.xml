THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET.Copy No. -W.P. (43) 364.9th August, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE BOMBING OF ROME.BY direction of the Prime Minister I circulate the following extract fromthe Ministry of Information Home Intelligence Weekly Report of the 29th July,1943, for the information of the War Cabinet and the Defence Committee.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,9th August, 1943.The bombing of Rome. .&quot;So they have bombed Rome at last I&apos;m glad! &quot; seems to have been the reaction of all but a very few. This is usually followed by : &quot; Why have wewaited so long ? &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; Why apologise ? &apos;&apos; The raid is thought by many to havebeen &quot; the finishing touch, the final push that toppled over Mussolini.&quot; Manyhope it will be &quot; followed up by others, which, in the view of some people, need notbe preceded by leaflets and can include the Vatican City.&quot;Roman Catholic opinion, with a few exceptions notably in Northern Ireland is said to &quot; approve of the bombing, if it is really necessary for the war effort.&quot;Some, indeed, are described as being &quot; all for it.&quot; Many Catholics point to thedestruction of the churches of Britain and ask :&apos;&apos; Why should the Axis shelterbehind our Catholic churches:? &quot; The general feeling- among Catholics seems tobe-&quot; We are British first.&quot;The planning and execution of the raid are more criticised than praised thisweek. Although the care taken in preparing and carrying out the raid is againcommended, many people are very critical of &quot; unjustifiable risks to the airmen &quot;involved by:  (a) The dropping of warning leaflets (Six Regions) :  There is sarcasticcomment on the lines of : &quot; How decent it was to warn the Italians!No one sent me a warning the night before my home was destroyed.&quot;(b) Precision bombing (Three Regions) : Airmen&apos;s lives are &quot; worth morethan historic monuments.&quot;(c) Carrying out the raid in daylight (Two Regions) : It was thought &quot;foolishto arrange for valuable pilots to present a clearly seen target to well-prepared defences.&quot;The airmen taking part: There is comment on the fact that only Americanstook part in the raid, and some regret that there were no British airmen. It seven said, by a few that &quot;our men refused to do it.&quot; Others think it was ashrewd move &apos;&apos; to counter United States Catholic opinion &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; cause lesstrouble with the Pope.&quot; People were interested that Roman Catholic pilotstook part. A few suggest that it is now the turn of the British to bomb Rome,to show the Americans we have not left them &quot; to face the dirtiest piece of propaganda this war has yet produced.&quot;The Ancient Monuments in Rome are the cause of some apprehension, whichhas been greatly relieved by details of &quot; the accuracy of our bombing and ourcare not to injure historic objects.&quot;  Nevertheless, a minority regret the damage(Signed)E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.[25900]
to the Basilica of San Lorenzo. &quot; Those who had thought that all of Rome wasstuffed with places of antiquity welcomed the maps, which relieved them of the fear that air-raids could not fail to destroy much that was of historic interest.&quot;. It is clear, however, that the general public do not understand why there shouldbe any cultural reasons for distinguishing between Rome and London, Canterburyor Coven try.The Pope. The Pope&apos;s letter to the Vicar-General of Rome has caused considerable comment, most of it adverse. There is said to be no sympathy &quot;forthe Pope,, and some sardonic comment at his claims to be impartial. There isimpatience at his protests, which are thought to have come &quot; rather late in theday.&quot; Many people believe that the Pope &quot;condoned the terrible attack on oneof the oldest Christian peoples &quot; the Abyssinians. It is also asked why the Popeshould &quot; cry out when one Roman Catholic church suffers partial damage and remain silent when 4,000 religious edifices in this country including St. Paul&apos;sand other Cathedrals have been attacked? &quot; There is also some comment that&quot; he made no mention of the loss of life, but only of buildings.&quot;
