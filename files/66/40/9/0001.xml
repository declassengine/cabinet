THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1943.W.P. (43) 359.3rd August, 1943.WAR CABINET.CONVICTION OF D. F. SPRINGHALT, OF ESPIONAGE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I think it may be of interest to my colleagues to have some informationadditional to that published in the press about the case of D. F. Springhall, whowas recently convicted at the Central Criminal Court before Mr. Justice Oliverof an offence against Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act (espionage) and wassentenced to seven years&apos; penal servitude^Springhall is a prominent Communist. He joined the British CommunistParty on its foundation in 1920. In that year he was discharged from the Navy(&quot; services no longer required &quot;) for associating with revolutionaries. After theGeneral Strike, in connection with which he served two terms of imprisonment(one of two months for possessing documents containing statements likely to cause disaffection, and one of three months for publishing leaflets likely to causedisaffection), he went to Russia and remained there about four years. In 1932 hewas elected to the Party&apos;s Central Committee and remained a member of it untilJuly of this year, when, as a result of his arrest on this charge, he ceased to holdany office in the Party. In 1939 he became a member of the Political Bureau andin 1940 National Organiser. He held both these posts at the time of his arrest.At the outbreak of war he was in Moscow, and it was he who, at the end ofSeptember 1939, returned from Russia with the news that the war was regarded by the Communist International as an unjust imperialist struggle which the Partymust oppose. During the period in which Pollitt refused to accept this lineSpringhall was a member of the secretariat of three which replaced him.In October 1942 Springhall called at the flat of Mrs. Sheehan, an establishedClerical Officer in the Air Ministry, and asked to talk to her. He refused to give his name, but by way of credentials showed her a Communist Party card.Mrs. Sheehan professes to be Left Wing in politics, but she is almost certainlya Communist. He questioned her on her upbringing and&apos; background, heroccupation and her attitude towards Russia. Finally, he obtained her permission to make regular visits at intervals of about a fortnight. At these meetings theydiscussed communism and the war in Russia. Some time in December 1942 hesuggested to Mrs. Sheehan that Britain was not co-operating with the Russians,and eventually beguiled her into believing that by passing secret information tohim she would be helping the Soviet Union to win the war. Mrs. Sheehan was not then in a position to obtain secret information, but in February of this year shewas transferred to a post in which papers dealing with highly secret experimental work passed through her hands. She told Springhall the nature of her work,and subsequently gave him any information which came into her possession aboutthe progress of the experiments, the purpose for which the device in question was to be used, and the circumstances of its production, including the name ofthe manufacturers. This continued until last June, when Mrs. Sheehan, who,owing to illness, was unable to see Springhall herself, asked the friend who sharedher flat to give him a note.   This friend already suspected Mrs. Sheehan of[25869]
disclosing secret information. She opened the note, and, finding in it further particulars of the secret device and a list of Communist sympathisers in the AirMinistry, informed the authorities.Mrs. Sheehan was dealt with summarily under the Defence Regulations andsentenced to three months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour. She made a frankadmission of the part she had played and gave evidence for the Crown againstSpringhall at his trial. The jury found Springhall guilty of obtaining for a purpose prejudicial to the safety of the State information which might be useful to an enemy, and he was sentenced to seven years&apos; penal servitude.Although there is no evidence that Springhall in this matter was acting on instructions from the Communist Party, it cannot be assumed that this is anisolated incident, or that it is not part of the policy of the Party to engage inespionage activities in the interests of the Soviet Union. My information isthat there is a great risk of the Party trading on the current sympathy for russia to induce people who would not think of betraying secrets to the enemy to betray them to the Party in the belief that by so doing they are helping theSoviet Union. I have given instructions to the Security Services to continueto exercise ever closer vigilance over the Party&apos;s activities.H. M.Home Office, S.W. 1,3rd August, 1943.
