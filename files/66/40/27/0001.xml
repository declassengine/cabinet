Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1943.SECRET.-v^J   Copy No.33W.P. (43) 377.24dh August, 1943.WAR CABINET.YEMENI ENCROACHMENT IN THE ADEN PROTECTORATE.THE Governor of Aden has recently reported an encroachment by a smallYemeni detachment of about 300 or 400 men on the eastern side of the peninsulaof Sheikh Said, which faces the island of Perim from the Arabian side of theStraits of Bab el Mandab at the southern end of the Red Sea. The position ofthe frontier between the Kingdom of the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate ishere (as elsewhere) governed by the Treaty of Sana (1934), which laid it down that, pending the settlement of the question of the southern frontier of the Yemen,the two Governments agreed &quot; to maintain the situation existing in regard tothe frontier on the date of the signature of the Treaty,&quot; that is on the11th February, 1934.   This is what is known as the &quot; status quo line.&quot;2. There is no doubt that on that date the actual frontier, on this sectionof it, was still in fact as it had been drawn by the British and Turkish Govern-ments before the 1914-18 war, and as shown on the official map accompanyingthe Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914, i.e., it was a straight line which leavesthe greater part of the Sheikh Said peninsula within the Yemen but the easternshore of it within the Aden Protectorate.3. It is clear from photographs which the Governor has sent home thatthe Yemenis have transgressed this line. While there may be. some confusion intheir minds about the exact position of the frontier in this area, it can probablybe assumed that the Yemenis are aware that they were transgressing Avhen they came clown to the sea on the eastern side of the Sheikh Said peninsula. the imam is very sensitive about this peninsula, and the present encroachment onits eastern edge is probably part of the Yemenis&apos; plan to safeguard their position-on the main part of the peninsula against all comers, including ourselves. Forthis reason the Imam will be very reluctant to withdraw his troops, and is likelyto refuse to do so unless compelled by us, either by force or by an unmistakable,and genuine threat of force. If, therefore, the Governor has to resort to threats,he requires authority to act on them should the necessity arise.4. The Governor believes that, if this incident is not checked, it will befollowed by similar encroachments elsewhere on the border. There have, in fact,during recent years, been several instances of attempted Yemeni infiltration on other parts of the frontier. For example, the Yemenis have recently beenintriguing on the Beihan border of the Protectorate, which lies to the north-east of Aden. The Governor has, in consequence, found it advisable to strengthen theforce of Aden Protectorate Government Guards within that district, and I have approved Sir John HalFs action.In the case now under consideration of the Yemeni encroachment nearSheikh Said, the Governors written protests to the Imam have so far producedno results except counter-claims from the Yemeni side, and it is for this reason that he has requested authority to inform the Imam, that he will be compelled toassert British protective rights over the area concerned by causing all Yemenimilitary buildings and works there to be destroyed.5. Past experience has shown that it is practicable to take forcible actionagainst the Imam without technically going to war with his country. It is alsoknown that the Arabs of the Aden Protectorate look to His Majesty&apos;s government memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.[25983]
to defend its frontiers, and that, far from resenting action taken against the imam&apos;s forces when they intrude, the people of the Protectorate applaud it;such action, indeed, strengthens our position in their eyes. Should it become necessary to resort to a forcible ejection of the Yemeni detachment the Imammay complain that our action is a breach of the Treaty of Sana, but hisindignation is not likely to produce serious consequences. On the contrary, ourrelations with him have in the past improved when we have stood up to him;they have deteriorated only when we have shown acquiescence or indifference tohis incursions into the Protectorate.6. The present position is that, in a communication of the 5th July, the imam has politely reasserted his claim that the area where encroachment hastaken pJace lies within the Yemen, and that thus the stationing of troops thereis no violation of the Treaty. The Governor still hopes that the need for air action will he avoided, and to this end the Chief Secretary at Aden has writtenprivately to the Imam&apos;s Foreign Minister suggesting an arrangement which wouldenable the Imam to withdraw without loss of face. But the Imam may beobstinate, and before pi-oceeding further with negotiations Sir John Hall has asked for definite instructions, whether (a) he is authorised in the last resort to eject the Imam&apos;s troops by force, or(b) if persuasion fails, His Majesty&apos;s Government wish.him to accept thefait accompli.7. I am satisfied that British interests in this area will be best served bya display of firmness with the Yemeni authorities. I therefore recommend thatthe authority which the Governor seeks, to use force in the last resort, shouldbe granted. I have consulted the Foreign Secretary, the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary of State for Air, who agree that the course whichthe Governor has recommended should be adopted. The proposed action, inwhich the Air Officer Commanding at Aden has concurred, would be taken bythe Royal Air Force alone, and would be preceded by air demonstration andwarning. If this policy is approved, I should make it clear to Sir John Hallthat action should be strictly limited to a local operation in the area concerned and that it should not extend beyond the boundary of the Aden Protectorate.O. S.Colonial Office,24:th August, 1943.
