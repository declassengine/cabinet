THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 480.25th October, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1943 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES ANDMANDATED TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.THE part played by Canadian troops in the operations on the Italian frontwas given great prominence in the press, and Mr. Church ill&apos;s &quot;tribute to Canada&apos;swar effort in his Quebec broadcast was widely quoted and deeply appreciated.2. The General Election in Prince Edward Island resulted in the return ofthe Liberal Government. The results show that twenty Liberals and eightProgressive Conservatives were&apos; elected, two seats yet having to be filled. Theoutstanding feature of the election was the defeat of all C.C.F. candidates, nineof whom took part in the election. This party has made remarkable progress oflate in Canadian politics, and, although it was at first cold-shouldered by theTrades Unions, it has now obtained much official support from them. The Partyis well led, and the Prince Edward Island election result cannot be regarded asmore than a merely temporary setback. The Liberal Party realise the threat tothem from this source, for most of the progress of the C.C.F. is solid and more orless permanent. Mr. Mackenzie King is determined to avoid a general electionuntil after the war in view of the consequent embarrassment to the war effort ofa war-time election. This may well mean, however, the defeat of the LiberalParty after the war, menaced as it is both by the C.C.F. and by the ProgressiveConservative Party led by Mr. John Bracken. The latter has not so far attemptedto enter the Federal House of Commons. Instead, he has been making anextended tour of the whole country, studying the local aspects of national problemson the spot and has made himself known to Canadians everywhere. If and whenhe enters Parliament, he will be able to claim a recent and thorough personalacquaintance with the country, and under his leadership the Conservative Partyhas experienced a revival in its fortunes.3. The presentation of the majority Report of the National&apos;&quot;War Labour-Board has raised afresh the question of increasing wage levels and has led to somespeculation whether the War-time Prices and Trade Board will be able tomaintain the present prices &quot;ceiling.&quot; There is every indication that theGovernment intend to stand firm on their present policy of price stabilisation,but Mr. Ilsley has declared that, &quot; if labour costs go up substantially and widely,we cannot hope to hold the price ceiling.&quot;4. Mr. Cohen, the representative of Labour on the National War LabourBoard, whose advocacy of the Labour point of view was regarded by his colleaguesas inconsistent with the principles on which the Board was constituted, has beendismissed from the Board by means of an Order in Council. Mr. Cohen haspublicly referred to the Government^ action as a fresh manifestation of itshostility to the organised Labour Movement in Canada, although the sting hasbeen taken out of the criticism by the Governments prompt action in appointingMr. John Bell, a prominent Trade Unionist, as his successor.
Naval, Military and Air Activities.5. H.M.C. Destroyer Si. Croicc, while escorting an outward-bound Atlanticconvoy, was torpedoed and sunk south of Iceland (C) on the 20th. Five officersand seventy-six ratings were picked up by another of the escort vessels which washerself subsequently sunk. There was finally only one survivor from St. Croix.H.M.C. Destroyer Gatine.au was damaged by the premature explosion of anti-submarine equipment during the same operations.6. Early on the morning of the 3rd September the Eighth Army assaultedthe mainland of Italy with units of United Kingdom and Canadian troops.Under cover of a strong Naval force, continuous air protection and a heavyartillery barrage across the Strait of Messina, the leading Canadian Brigadelanded in the Reggio area against negligible opposition.7. Reggio was captured by the Canadians on the day of the assault and theairfield outside the town was also occupied. Practically no demolitions had beencarried out on the airfield or at Reggio, where the communication services werefound to be in working order and the harbour was quickly prepared to receiveour shipping. From Reggio the First Canadian Division advanced in twodirections, north-eastwards through San Stefano to Delianuova, which theyoccupied on the 6&apos;th, and southwards along the coast road to Bova Marina. Atthe same time they struck inland through the mountains and reached Roccaforteon the same day.8. After the landing of the Fifth Army in the Salerno area and inconsequence of the severe German opposition which it encountered, the EighthArmy in Calabria made great efforts to reach the Salerno area and-threaten theflank of the German forces. On the east coast Canadian forces entered Cotroneon the 11th and thence moved inland and established themselves between Spezzanoand Castrovillari. Meanwhile a third British force landed at Taranto on the9th and patrols from this force joined up with the Eighth Army on the 16th.9. Progress northwards, in spite of determined efforts, was not particularlyrapid, being opposed by enemy rear-guards and continual demolitions. TheUnited Kingdom and Canadian forces, however, continued to fight their wayforward in spite of demolished bridges, mines and narrow twisting roads.Casualties at this stage were light but great efforts were demanded of the troops,particularly of the engineers and supply columns. By the third week of the monthcontact had been firmly established on the right between the Canadians andUnited Kingdom formations from Taranto and on the left between the FifthDivision and the United States forces of the Fifth Army.10. After the capture of Foggia on the 27th the right flank of the EighthArmy made more rapid progress to the west and north-west and the Canadiansmoved up to Lucara at the end of the month.11. There were thirty-five R.C.A.F. Squadrons engaged in operationsduring the month of which five operated from outside the United Kingdom,including one Fighter Squadron in Italy and three Wellington Squadronstemporarily lent to the Mediterranean area. The activity of Canadian Squadronsin the United Kingdom was approximately on the same scale as that of theR.A.F. in general. Percentage of bomber losses in No. 6 group 4-5 per cent,were, however, slightly higher than the percentage. of losses for the whole ofBomber Command 4 per cent. In all thirty-five bombers were lost as well asfive day fighters and two Intruder aircraft. R.C.A.F. fighters reported a totalof twenty-three enemy aircraft destroyed. No. 425 French Canadian Squadron(Wellingtons) in the Mediterranean area flew 1,450 hours on operations againstthe enemy without loss.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.12. In Australia there has been considerable jubilation over the successfuloperations in New Guinea, but, at the same time, some doubt whether the strengthof the Japanese was not over-estimated. Discussion still continues in Australiaas to the interpretation to be placed on Lord Louis Mountbatten&apos;s appointment tothe Supreme Command in South-East Asia. An Australian Government spokes-man was quoted as saying that the Commonwealth Government would vigorouslyresist any attempt to lessen General MacArthuPs authority.
13. The Governor-General opened the 17th Parliament on the23rd September. The speech from the throne contained a long exposition ofthe now more favourable military situation, expressed gratitude to the UnitedKingdom and the United States for their assistance, and paid tribute to theefforts of the Soviet Union and China, and to the co-operation of the Netherlandsin the South-West Pacific Area. The Government are to undertake a compre-hensive review of the nature, extent, and plans of the Australian war effort, andwill consider those classes of production which have been unduly depressed becauseof the earlier paramount urgency of other demands. Plans are being preparedfor post-war development in Australian resources, and provision is being madefor social services and for the re-establishment in civil life of soldiers and workersin war industry. The Governor-General announced that a proposal would shortlybe submitted to Parliament enabling them to deal effectively with the problemof post-war reconstruction which, he said, would, clearly have to be dealt withfrom a national standpoint. The proposal will include the reinstatement in thenational life of the fighting forces; provision of employment and prevention ofunemployment; rehabilitation and development of primary and secondaryindustries and work of national value, including provision for land and airtransport.14. Press discussion still continues on Mr. Curtin&apos;s recent statementregarding an &quot; Empire Council.&quot; It is widely welcomed, and taken as an indica-tion that Labour has at last abandoned its somewhat isolationist standpoint.15. The newspapers generally have been urging the need for the eliminationof some weak Ministers, but the vote of the Labour caucus has retained all theformer Ministers, with one unimportant exception.Naval, Military and A ir A ctivities.16. The question of providing army personnel for formations and units inNew Guinea and other operational areas on the mainland has become a pressingproblem. As the intake into the Army fails to meet normal wastage, additionalwastage caused by battle and other casualties can be replaced only by a reductionin the Order of Battle on the mainland. During September instructions wereissued for a reduction in the composition of the 3rd Australian Corps andWestern Australia Lines of Communications area, where the Field Force andLines of Communications units will now consist of (i) Headquarters, 3rdAustralian Corps; (ii) 2nd Australian Division; (iii) 1st Australian ArmouredBrigade Group as corps troops; (iv) corps troops required for (i) and (ii);(v) base and L. of C. units required for fixed defences and maintenance offormations, &amp;o, in Western Australia.17. Headquarters, 1st Australian Armoured Division and Divisional troops,have been deleted from the Order of Battle. Certain units and portions of unitsof the 1st Australian Armoured Division have been transferred to the1st Australian Armoured Brigade Group and 3rd Australian Motor Brigade.Certain specialists will be transferred as reinforcements in their own arms; otherpersonnel will undergo conversion training for eventual posting as infantryreinforcements.18. The number of personnel available for absorption and reinforcements asa result of this reorganisation is approximately 9,000, 80 per cent, of whomare A.I.F.19. For some time past the question of liaison with General Headquarters,India, has been under consideration. It has now been decided thatBrigadier J. E. E. Lloyd is to go to India for about six months as an Adviseron matters relating to jungle warfare&apos; resulting from experience gained inNew Guinea.Arrangements are also in hand for a visit of 50 British officers from Indiato spend about six months in the South-West Pacific area to gain experience intropical warfare. They are expected to arrive in Australia about mid-October,whence they will go for training to the jungle warfare training centre atCanungra. Later they will be attached to units in New Guinea and elsewhereto receive first-hand experience of jungle warfare as it affects the respective armsof the service to which they belong.20. During September the following operations in New Guinea werecarried out: (i) Operations were continued against Salamaua until it wasoccupied on the 11th; (ii) Combined operations were carried out on the Lae area
from the 4th September resulting in the capture of Lae on the 16th;(iii) Operations in the Markham River continued; (iv) A successful landing wasmade in the Finschhafen area on the 22nd. In all these operations our casualtieswere light, but heavy losses were inflicted on the enemy.Total United States forces in Australia at the end of September, includingAir Corps and anti-aircraft units, was 253,170 all ranks.NEW ZEALAND.21. The General Election in New Zealand resulted in the return of theLabour Government, although with a reduced majority, the Party having lost10 seats and won 3. There was a decided swing to the National Party, but theloss of at least 7 seats can be largely attributed to vote-splitting by Mr. Lee&apos;sDemocratic Party, which, incidentally, did not succeed in gaining a single seat.The state of the Parties now is : Labour     ...      ...      ......      ... 44National   ...      ...      ...      ....      ...      ...      35Independent        ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        1Among the defeated candidates were Mr. Nordmeyer, Minister of Health, andMr. Barclay, Minister of Marketing and Agriculture, together withSir Apirana Ngata (Nationalist), the senior Maori member and &quot;father&quot; ofthe House.22. In the Labour Standard of the 20th September the Prime Ministersaid, as regards the prospect of a Coalition Government, &quot; we do not propose tobe handicapped or trammelled in any way by sharing authority for carrying outour policy and legislative and administrative plans for its realisation with anyperson or party which has opposed us and our programme and has been rejectedby the people.&quot;23. Mr. Curtin&apos;s statement on the proposed All-Empire Council, which hasbeen widely commended by the New Zealand press, was further commented onpublicly by the Prime Minister on the 9th September. Mr. Fraser said : &quot; I amaccordingly in favour of any scheme which will bring the Dominions into closerconsultation with the United States and the United Kingdom and with each other.If a scheme for providing a workable basis for a permanent British CommnwealthOrganisation consistent with the status of the Dominions is put forward, it willbe welcomed by New Zealand.&quot;Naval, Military and Air Activities.24. The move of the 3rd New Zealand Division to the Solomons has beencompleted. The 14th Brigade Group has landed in Vella Lavella where mainDivisional Headquarters are now situated and the General Officer Commanding,3rd Division, has been appointed Commanding-General. The 8th Brigade Groupremains at Guadalcanal.25. New Zealand patrols landed at Vella Lavella on the 21st and establishedcontact with the Japanese. These patrols were rapidly supported and on the22nd the New Zealand forces on the island amounted to two battalions. By the28th 300 Japanese had been surrounded and were resisting desperately.26. Total New Zealand forces in Norfolk Island are now 710. A reductionfrom 1,750 to 1,000 will be made in the New Zealand garrison of Tonga.27. Since the 1st April, 1943, 11,000 men have been released from the armyto return to industry.   Possibility of further releases is being examined.28. Dive-bomber squadrons using Douglas Dauntless aircraft are beinglormed in New Zealand.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.29. Now that the Parliamentary elections are over, the next election, whichwill take place on the 13th October, is for the four Provincial Councils. Thereis every indication that, with the war issue now finally decided, the United andNationalist Parties will choose the question of education as their battleground.The former is concentrating for attack on the present system of instruction
through the home language only, while the latter is rallying with equalenthusiasm to the defence of the system as the most effective means of main-taining the racial division in South African politics. It is interesting to notethat, while the country voted overwhelmingly for General Smuts personally inthe recent General Election, they did not vote for the United Party as such,and members of the Cabinet, other than the Prime Minister, remain generallyunpopular. By the time that Parliament meets in January, the Governmentmay well find itself faced with a serious and embarrassing revolt among membersof the United Party itself, and it is certain to encounter trouble from the LabourParty, which will do its best to exploit the general demand for more radicalpolicies. The Nationalist Party has suffered a most decisive defeat on the warissue and has made virtually no progress in its Parliamentary reputation. Atthe same time, the elimination of its rivals on the Opposition side has removedan embarrassing situation, and Dr. Malan hopes now to be able to speak asthe sole leader of &quot; Afrikanerdom &quot; in Parliament. He will continue his over-tures to the English-speaking people and try to convince them that their rightswill not be threatened by the establishment of a Republic. He may even, as in1924, relegate the Republican ideal to an obscure place in his programme, and,for the rest, will base his. hopes on the reaction which usually overtakes warGovernments in the difficult clays of peace.30. No decision has yet been reached by the Union Government regardingthe request of the South-West African Legislative Assembly that the MandatedTerritory should be incorporated in the Union as a fifth province. TheAdministrator of South-West Africa, Colonel Hoogenhout, came to Pretoriato convey the Assembly&apos;s resolution to the Prime Minister and has had conversa-tions with General Smuts and other members of the Cabinet. In any event, it isunlikely that any significant steps in the matter will be taken while the war isin progress.Economic.31. A Joint Supply Council has been constituted in South Africa withrepresentatives of the Governments of the Union of South Africa, the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom.32.   The prime functions of the Council will be : (a) To examine and give authoritative advice in regard to the importanceof the Union&apos;s various industries, in relation to its national economy,and the extent to which the Unioifs economic war effort can mostusefully be developed, in the light of present and probable futureconditions, and in relation to productive resources available.(b) To review and ascertain the Union&apos;s overall requirements programmeas prepared by the Union authorities for achieving the best utilisationof its resources in the war effort and for the needs of its domesticeconomy.(c) To determine and approve the Union&apos;s essential import requirementswithin the agreed, programme, to review and make a determinationregarding any vital or important items of requirements or itemspresenting, or likely to present, special difficulties.(d) To review the fulfilment of the programme, with particular reference topriorities and to special needs. i(e) To give authoritative advice or replies to enquiries which may arise inLondon or in Washington on important aspects of policy relating toUnion production or requirements.(/) To assist the Union Government in furnishing the Union High Commis-sioner in London, and the South African Government Supply Missionin Washington, with shipping programmes for communication to theappropriate authorities in London and Washington.33. The creation of the Joint Supply Council will in no way alter theexisting supply organisation, nor existing arrangements for the procurement ofsupplies. The Council will not deal with finished combatant materials for directuse by the military.The United Kingdom Representative on the Council is the High Commis-sioner for the United Kingdom, Lord Harlech; the United States Representativeis the United States Minister, Mr MacVeagh; and the Union representative is theUnion Director-General of Supplies, Dr. H. J. van der Bijl.The inaugural meeting of the Council was held in Pretoria on the^rd September.
NEWFOUNDLAND.34. The Parliamentary Mission to Newfoundland has returned - to theUnited Kingdom after having completed a tour throughout the Island whichlasted for over three months. Confidential reports by the members of theMission have been made to the Secretary of State, and it is probable that anearly opportunity will occur for them to put their views before the House.&quot;The Mission&apos;s activities included a visit to the Labrador, and altogetherthey covered by various means of transport nearly 4,000 miles. During theirjourney they interviewed large numbers of the different sections of the popula-tion. The visit as a whole was most favourably received by the Newfoundlandpress and public, and has stimulated local discussion of the political andeconomic future of the Island.EIRE.35. In an address to the Defence Forces at Dundalk on the 12th September,Mr. cle Valera said &quot; Not only for the present, but for a long time afterwards, wewill need the manhood of the country to be trained as they are at present in thevoluntary forces, and if we cannot have them in the volunteer forces, it may benecessary for the existence of this nation that compulsory service will beintroduced. Let no one think that the clanger is past. You are in a strongerposition now because of what you have learnt and done than you were two or threeyears ago. We must build on that strength to become stronger.&quot; Mr. de Valera&apos;spaper, the Irish Press, although it carried a much longer report of the speech thanthose contained in the other Irish papers, omitted all reference to the threat ofconscription.36. At the Convention of Fianna Fail at the end of September,Mr. cle Valera described the ending of Partition as Eire&apos;s only outstandingpolitical objective. He said &quot; No Irishman worthy of the name of being Irishwants Partition and in that you have the best security that it will ultimately goas a number of other things repugnant to the feelings of our people have gone.I don&apos;t want to speak about it any more. There is nobody in the country who doesnor. believe that everything humanly possible to get rid of that we shall do. Thereare of course prices which we are not prepared to pay even for the abolition ofPartition. We have a right to the unity of our country and we have a right to theindependent action of our people also. We are not going to sacrifice one of theserights in order to obtain the other. Both are due to us. I don&apos;t think that talkwill help much at the present time; all I can promise is that we will try to doeverything we can to bring the wrong of Partition to the notice of all those whohave any power to remedy it.&quot;At the Convention, Mr. de Valera devoted considerable time to the questionof the restoration of the Irish language. A feature of his remarks was anadmonition to the Irish-speaking critics and he made the point that the languagesometimes was unfortunate in the people who advocated it. He believed that thegreat majority of the people wanted it but they were not willing to make thesacrifices necessary to have it. If they did not make those sacrifices, the languagewould be lost and with it would go nationhood.INDIA.fReport by the Secretary of State for India.Political.37. There is still no development to report in the field of All-India politics.Evidences of the return of the country to peaceful conditions after the distur-bances of last year appear in the reported release in various Provinces ofnumbers of persons who had been kept in detention for several months. Thesereleases have no major political significance, and there is at present no change inthe decision of Government to continue the detention of Mr. Gandhi and theCongress leaders who have so far given no sign of renouncing the policy whichled to the Congress resolution of the 8th August, 1942, and the subsequentdisorders.
38. Public attention is still turned in the main to internal difficulties, andthe operation of responsible government in the Provinces is undergoing a severetrial in Bengal owing to the alarming crisis in the local food situation. TheBengal Ministry is striving hard to bring the situation under control in the faceof virulent criticism from opponents who in fact must bear a large share ofresponsibility for the present situation through their shortcomings when in office.The Ministry have, however, scored a success in securing approval for their budgetproposals which they had failed to carry through the Legislature last May,and this success ought to strengthen their position generally.External and Frontier Relations.39. Afghanistan. The Afghan Government informed the United StatesMinister that they intended to have nothing to do with Mussolinps new Govern-nient and were trying to get instructions to their Minister in Rome to joinMarshal Badoglio.40. Afghans&apos; reactions to the progress of the war generally became moreand more favourable to the Allies, and in official circles there was an increasingreadiness to admit that the Axis have now no hope of avoiding defeat. Afghansin general were believed to be pleased at the successful formation of a MuslimLeague Ministry in the North-West Frontier Province and the present discom-fiture of Congress.41. The Italian Minister in Kabul and his staff announced their loyaltyto the King of Italy and to Marshal Badoglio&apos;s Government. The three membersof the German Legation staff left Kabul for repatriation under safe-conduct onthe 25th September for India. The Afghan Government suggested that thedeparture of the Italian Anzilotti, who was to have accompanied, them, shouldin the changed circumstances be postponed for the time being until the situationin Italy became clearer.42. After considerable negotiations His Majesty&apos;s Minister was successfulin persuading the Afghans to agree to the release of the two interned Britishairmen subject to confirmation by the Cabinet. The aircraft is also likely to bereturned.43. Negotiations for the purchase of Afghan wool by a U.K.C.C.representative acting on behalf of Russia have been at a standstill owing tofailure to agree on a price. The Russians have now authorised a fresh attemptat compromise.44. Before he left, Sir Francis Wylie had made representations to theAfghan Government on the subject of certain new trade regulations whichappeared to impose special disabilities on the Indian traders in Afghanistan.The Afghan Government who manifested some annoyance at this representation,refused to modify the regulations, but in practice have administered them in sucha way as not to impose undue hardship on Indian traders who have been givenlicences to continue their trade.45. North-West Frontier. The Frontier remained quiet except for a certainrise in temperature early in the month caused by the activities of the Faqir of Ipiand other religious notables in Waziristan. The advent of Ramzan had agenerally quietening effect.46. Tibet. The renewed reports of Chinese concentrations against Tibetwere brought to the notice of Dr. Soong in Washington. His reactions were notsatisfactory. He said that he did not know- whether there was or was not anytroop concentration of the kind reported, but, in any case, since China regardedTibet as Chinese territory, the movement of troops was, in China&apos;s view, aninternal matter. There was no question of oppressing Tibet or producing dis-turbances there, any more than there was in any other Chinese province. He wenton to say that the question of Tibet was a &quot; flea-bite &quot; in comparison with theimportance of Anglo-Chinese relations and deplored what seemed a tendency ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, and especially of the Government of India, to make itan issue between us. He earnestlv hoped that we should not raise the questionformally in Chungking.No further reports of any Chinese movements against Tibet were receivedduring the month.
47. The Persian Gulf. Public opinion was optimistic as the result, of theRussian advances, the surrender of Italy and our attack in Italy. It was hopedthat the recent successes would lead to the easing of the food supply situation inthe Persian Gulf. The Sultan of Muscat and the more important Sheikhs sentcongratulatory messages to His Majesty&apos;s Government on the Italian surrender.The Persian Gulf Fighter Fund has now been closed down after having reachedits target of a complete squadron of nine aircraft, with sufficient money in handfor the purchase of a tenth machine.Economic.48. The internal economic situation in India continues to give serious causefor concern. A number of measures designed to combat the onset of inflationhave been taken from time to time by the Government of India, as indicated inprevious reports; and the whole question is under active consideration by theCommittee on Indian Financial Questions which was appointed last August bythe War Cabinet. This Committee has before it at present two memorandapresented to it towards the end of September, one (I.F. (43) 7) on &quot; General Policyof Production in India.&quot; and the other (T.F. (43) 8) on &quot;Anti-InflationaryPolicy in the Field of Public Finance.&quot;49. The food situation in certain areas, most conspicuously in Bengal, hascontinued to be anxious, and a strong appeal by the Viceroy for a substantialincrease in the shipments of grain to India, supported also by a memorandumfrom the Chiefs of Staff, was considered by the War Cabinet on the24th September. The effect of the decision arrived at was that, in the light ofother claims upon the available shipping, the claim to have 500.000 tons of&quot; grainshipped to India within the next few months must be rejected, but a materialincrease in the amount which had previously been in prospect was decided upon.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.50. Royal Indian Navy. FI.M.I.S. Kistna was commissioned on the 18thAugust in United Kingdom.The following vessels were launched in India during August :-3 Fairmiles.45 L.C.As.51. Military. The general situation remains unchanged. Our patrolshave been active on the whole front. In Arakan, enemy patrol activity hasincreased, but our patrols retain the initiative. Owing to rain, roads on theAssam front have frequently been closed or partially closed. In Buthidaungarea Japanese troops are reported to be suffering severely from dysentery.52. Air. With improved weather conditions our air activity has increased.The regular patrol of the Arakan coast, shipping escorts and anti-submarinepatrols in Indian and Ceylonese Coastal waters, Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengalhave continued. Enemy troops and supply depots in the Mayu peninsula andoil installations at Akyab were very effectively bombed. Fighter attacks onwater transport on the Irrawadcly, Chindwin, Mayu and Kaledan rivers havedestroyed many Sampans carrying troops, - oil barges and river steamers.Engines and railway targets were also attacked. Demands for supply droppingwere on a reduced scale.   Photographic reconnaissance considerably increased.Long-range offensive operations have continued to be carried out byU.S.A.A.F.Enemy activity has remained slight.53. General. The August intake of recruits for the Army was about5,000 below the average. This was principally due to stricter selections, thealready heavy drain on suitable classes and high wages in the labour market.R.I.AT. recruitment has remained steady, while I.A.F. recruitment has droppedsomewhat. Difficulty is being experienced in finding sufficient officers for flyingduties.54. It is hoped that all British ranks with seven years&apos; service overseaswill have been sent home hy the end of September. Unless, however, the strengthof drafts is increased and shipping is made available the number affected willagain increase.55. Morale of formations in the forward areas of the Eastern Army issatisfactory and is rising.
56. Health continues good and the incidence of malaria shows an improve-inent compared with 1942.57. A successful operation to &quot; devoice&quot; horses and mules has beenevolved. Animals require about a month to recover from the shock and loss ofcondition.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.58. Occupied Burma. Further information has been gathered concerningthe activities of the puppet Government since the declaration of independence.A great many Leagues and Associations have been formed, such as the NationalService Association, the East Asia Youths League, the Burma Women&apos;s PatrioticLeague, &amp;c, no doubt with the object of increasing the puppet Governments holdover the people, There are reasons for believing that the declaration has hadsome effect on pro-British Burmans outside Burma. Though their loyalty hasnot been affected, they feel that the fact that Japan and not Great Britain hasgranted Burma her &quot; freedom &quot; will be embarrassing.59. Frontier A dministration. The Chinese have made a partial withdrawalin the Northern Myitkyina area, but apparently intend to maintain a garrisonon our side of the frontier.60. General. The Governor of Burma is on a visit to this country forconsultation.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)The Secretary of State left&apos;England on the 8th September on a short visitto West Africa. After breaking his journey at Bathurst and Accra, he arrivedin Lagos on the 12th September. His tour of Nigeria, in the course of which hevisited Kaduna, Sokoto. Kano, Jos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibaden and Abeokuta,was completed on the 24th September, when he left for Accra. He completed histour of the Gold Coast on the 1st October, after which he spent a few days inSierra Leone.   He is at present in East Africa.Economic&apos; Affairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.61. The total cereals position is satisfactory. Stocks of all cereals at the21st September were over 60,000 tons, representing rather more than 6 weeks&apos;consumption, and imports to enable a satisfactory level of reserves to bemaintained have been programmed by the Ministry of War Transport up to theend of the year.62. There is more difficulty about individual foodstuffs. Supplies of ricefrom the purchase negotiated by the Ministry of Food in Egypt have not comeup to expectations, and it has been necessary to arrange for a cargo of 9,000 tonsto be shipped from Brazil in October to arrive in Ceylon early in December.63. Ceylon is also encountering great difficulty in obtaining supplies ofmiscellaneous foodstuffs which she has been drawing from India and which it isnot easy to replace from other sources. Among such foodstuffs are curry stuffs(which are very important to a population with the type of diet prevalent inCeylon), goats and sheep, which provide the bulk of the meat supply for the poorerclasses, dried fish and other items. In view of India&apos;s own internal food situation,the suspension of these exports is not altogether surprising.   The question is now
being examined whether it would be possible to persuade the Indian authoritiesto permit some of these food exports to continue in consideration of the. continuance of exports of certain foodstuffs which Ceylon sends to India. TheMinistry of Food and Ministry of War Transport are being asked to explorethe possibility of sending Ceylon foodstuffs such as pulses from other sourcesthan India.Northern Rhode sin.64. It has not hitherto been possible to find the additional supplies ofmaize which the Governor of Northern Rhodesia has asked for in order to restorenative rations to.the level from which they have been cut. There is a ban on theexport of maize from the River Plate, and the South African Government haveheld out no hope of an export surplus. The Governor has been asked to see ifany supplies can be obtained from neighbouring African territories.East A frica.65. Reports on the East African food position are less favourable than lastmonth. It seems certain that there will be no export surplus of maize from EastAfrica, and there is a possibility that imports may again have to be made nextyear.66. Textiles and other Consumer Goods. The supply of consumer goods tomaintain colonial production of export crops continues to give great difficulty,and there is a prospect that there will be a serious shortage of textiles in manycolonial areas in 1944 unless further supplies can be obtained from the UnitedStates. The possibility of obtaining supplies from that source is still underexamination, but. as shortages of civilian goods appear to be increasing in thatcountry, the prospects of obtaining help from this source appear to be diminishingrather than improving.Defence.West Indies.67. August Report, paragraph 80. Puerto Rican troops have now arrivedin St. Lucia and Trinidad, the other two places where it had been agreed withHis Majesty&apos;s Government that they might be posted. At the request of theUnited States State Department, an aide-memoire, presented by His Majesty&apos;,sAmbassador in Washington, requesting that no further postings should be madewithout His Majesty&apos;s Government being consulted, has been withdrawn, but HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador is continuing to press the same request orally.Man-Poiuer.68. West Indies. The scheme for the recruitment of tradesmen andtechnicians for the ground staff of the R.A.F. has recently been started in theWest Indies. Response has been most favourable and a R.A.F. officer is at presentin the West. Indies to advise the local Governments on methods of recruitment andtraining.69. East Africa. The possibility of recruiting and training East Africanand/or Mauritian artisan units for service with Royal Marine Engineering Unitsin future operations in the Far East is being examined in consultation with theAdmiralty. The number likely to be involved is not known at present, but it isnot expected to be large. In view of the acute man-power position in East Africa,it is thought that the Admiralty demand will have to be met from the revisedceiling for military recruitment which has recently been fixed. The question ofthe employment of about 5.000 East Africans for service with the R.A.F. in EastAfrica and the Middle East is also being considered.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.70. The capitulation of Italy caused widespread satisfaction and for a timeexcessive optimism. Both Arabs and Jews continued to pay considerable attentionto the post-war future.71. The trial of two of the three Jewish civilians implicated in thesmuggling of arms and ammunition into Palestine has now been completed.Sirkin and Rachlin have been sentenced (subject to the confirmation of the G.O.C.)to ten and seven years&apos; imprisonment respectively.
72. Affrays have occurred in Tel Aviv between United States soldiers andJewish civilians, resulting in twenty-eight minor civilian casualties. A certainelement of the Orthodox Jewish Community was incensed at young Jewish womenconsorting with Allied soldiers, and circulars and posters had appeareddenouncing the girls by name for consorting with non-Jews and threateningpunishments of Fascist pattern. The mounting resentment of the soldiersculminated in reprisals. The fact that&apos; Americans were involved seriouslyperturbed the Jewish authorities and the Mayor was profuse in his apologies.73. There was some increase in armed banditry, but there were no meansof deducing any political motive for this lawlessness. In the course of aconsequent action against bandits in the Galilee district, one British constablewas fatally wounded and one British sergeant was also wounded.74. Signs also of possible renewed activity by the remnants of the SternGroup were indicated by the murder of a well-known Revisionist, Israel Pritzker,in Tel Aviv on suspicion, it is understood, of giving information to the Police.75.   Arab and Jewish recruiting both remain very low.Kenya.76. The outline of a development programme covering the next five to tenyears has been received from the Governor of Kenya. He indicates his intentionof applying for grants and loans from the Colonial Development and WelfareVote totalling rather over  2,000,000 over a period of years chiefly for soilconservation, water supplies, African housing and agricultural training schools.Zanzibar.77. A survey of development needs has been received from the BritishResident, Zanzibar.Mauritius.78. Following upon an adjustment of wages, sabotage was committed duringthe night of the 23rd September in the northern district of Mauritius, followedby serious riots the next day amongst labourers on four estates. The police werestoned and had to fire, killing three persons. Three persons were wounded andthirteen injured in baton charges. Seventeen police were also injured. Thesituation later deteriorated, but strong military support was provided and nofurther incidents occurred.The disturbances were local and were confined to a group of estates in asmall area of the Island. The Governor visited the district with the OfficerCommanding Troops and reported on the 28th September that all was quiet andthat labourers on one of the estates concerned were probably returning to work onthat day. The causes of the outbreak are not clear, but a judicial enquiry is to beheld with as little delay as possible.Ceylon.79. On the 24th September the Governor reported that an incident occurredduring the night of the 22nd/23rd September in which three East African soldiersare alleged to have wounded two Sinhalese women and one man by rifle fire. Theincident gave rise to a hysterical display of feeling in the State Council in thecourse of which the Leader of the House (Mr. D. S. Senanayake) and two otherMembers made personal attacks on the Governor, because the latter had declinedto allow the Member of the State Council for the constituency in which theincident had occurred to bring before him a deputation of villagers from thevicinity. The Governor, while not refusing an intervieAv to the Member himself,had sent him a message through the Minister for Home Affairs that if he grantedthe interview he could do no more than explain that he had received no informationabout the incident, and could only instruct the Minister concerned to take actionfor a full enquiry, which, in effect, had already begun. On receipt of thismessage, the Member concerned did not see fit to interview the Governor.Full investigations are being made by the Police and Military Authorities,and the Commander-in-Chief has given an assurance that everything possible isbeing done to bring the offender to book.80. On the 27th September the Governor reported that an admirableleading article in the Sinhalese controlled Ceylon Daily News had deprecated theheat and recklessness of the State Council debate.   The article pointed out that
testimonies to the consistent good behaviour of overseas soldiers had been forth-coming from all sides and that the uproar in the State Council must be regardedas an unwarranted and regrettable lapse.It is not expected that there will be any further developments.Fiji. ;Sugar Dispute.31. On the 14th September the Governor reported that, notwithstanding theefforts of extremist leaders to strengthen Indian cane farmers in their determina-tion not to cut this years crop now ready for harvesting, the position thenappeared sufficiently promising to justify the reappointment of the Commissionof Enquiry. This was done and the Commission^ terms of reference werepurposeh made very wide so that am- constructive proposal could be considered.In some districts, farmers began to co-operate with the Commission and cut theircane, but in others, where the influence of extremists was stronger, the cane growersremained obdurate.   The recommendations of the Commission are still awaited.82. The situation remains quiet and no more arrests have been made sincethe 21st August.83. The Governor expressed the view in a telegram dated the 24th Septemberthat it was becoming increasingly clear that the dispute is, in fact, a strugglebetween two Indian political factions, the more extreme of which has nointention of letting the dispute be settled until the other has been destroyed. Theprosperity of farmers in some sugar areas owing to the large number of troopstends to make them indifferent to the fate of the cane crop.84. On the 31st August a secret telegram was sent to Fiji and othersugar producing Colonies notifying them that the Ministry of Food was proposingto make a general increase of 9d. a cwt. in the world price of sugar. The Governorconsiders that, if the wdiole of this increase were passed, on to the growers (who,however, demand much more), they might begin to cut their cane : but under theterms of the contract between the growers and the Colonial Sugar RefiningCompany, the latter retain a proportion of the increase, and up to the present theyhave announced their intention of adhering to the terms of the contract.85. The Governor is now considering whether the increase in the price ofsugar should be announced forthwith in the hope that it will induce growers tocut their cane..4 elation.86. Owing to a series of accidents, which fortunately involved no loss of life,all the aircraft owned by British West Indian Airways became unserviceable atthe end of August and the air services operated by the Company in the Easterngroup of West Indian Islands were temporarily suspended. Emergency arrange-ments were made by the Fleet Air Arm for the provision of aircraft to carryurgent mails until such time as the air services can be restarted. The RAT.Delegation in Washington are negotiating with Mr. Yerek as to the possibility ofthe provision of aircraft to tide the Company over its present difficulties.
