At Naples eight berths alongside were available on the 20th. Intensivework has raised the daily average of supplies discharged to 5,000 tons. Betweenthe 9th September and the 1st October, the totals unloaded at the ports and beachesused to supply the Fifth Army were 129,358 tons of stores, 32,721 vehicles and193,774 personnel. The Eighth Army, between the 16th September and the6th October, received through Taranto, Brindisi and Bari 56,750 tons of stores,7,659 vehicles and 49,481 personnel. Other Eighth Army ports and beaches,between the 3rd September and the 5th October, dealt with 48,352 tons of stores,25,588 vehicles and 97,409 personnel.Levant.8. ELM. cruisers and Allied destroyers have maintained patrols in theiEgean throughout the week and have landed stores at Leros and Kastelorizo.Ontdie night of the 16th./ 17th, HALS. Ilursley and the Greek destroyer Miaoiiles
s140bombarded Port Vat hi and Port Akti (Kalymnos); two E-boats and a small cargoship were sunk and a ship was set on fire. In a heavy attack, by enemy aircraftHursley was slightly damaged. On the following morning HMS Sirius(cruiser) while entering the yEgean was hit aft by a bomb and had a turret putout of action, She sustained 44 casualties, including 14 killed. On the nightof the 17th/18th, H.M. ships Jerms and Perm (destroyers) shelled Port Kalymnosand set a medium-sized ship on fire; fchey were ineffectively bombed while with-drawing. Hursley and Miaoules shelled the inner harbour at Kos On thefollowing night, Kalymnos was bombarded by H.M.S. Phoebe (cruiser) and Fury(destroyer) without opposition other than bombing. On the ni^ht of the19th/20th, IT.M.S. Belvoir (destroyer) shelled Kos, where a petrol dump was blownup and a large fire caused.H.M. S/M Trooper is overdue from patrol and must be considered lost.   -South-West Pacific.9. Allied patrol craft, operating in the Bismarck Archipelago on the 12th,sank a small ship off Eooke Island and damaged eight barges at Tuwu.A photographic reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 19th showed two heavycruisers, nine destroyers, six U-boats and 23 cargo ships, totalling 124,000 tons,in the harbour. The previous reconnaissance, on the 17th, showed a light cruiserpresent in addition.Anti-Submarine Operations. ,10. Twenty-four attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week :13 by shore-based aircraft, three by carrier-based aircraft and eight by surfacecraft.  None of the attacks was made in the Mediterranean.On the 16th and 17th, in the vicinity of two outward-bound convoys inmid-Atlantic, three U-boats were sunk by Liberator aircraft and one by H.M.S.Byard (frigate) in a support group. In addition, H.M.S. Sunflower (corvette)possibly sank a U-boat.A Liberator sank a German U-boat in the Gulf of Oman on the 16th.Three U-boats were possibly sunk by aircraft from the U.S.S. Cord on the13th, approximately 600 miles north of the Azores.Enemy Intelligence.German Fleet.11. It has been reported that, in the attack by our midget submarines, theTirpitz was hit by two torpedoes and is badly damaged and down by the bows.Many of her crew are stated to have been killed Photographic reconnaissance ofAltenfiord on the 16th showed the Tirpitz and Scharnhorst in their usual berths,with oil from the Tirpitz extending in streaks over a distance of four miles.U-Boats.12. There is a quiet phase at the moment in the North Atlantic but a newpack of U-boats is believed to be collecting in the central part of the North-Western Approaches. It is estimated that there are two U-boats off the SouthAmerican coast and two others between Guiana and Florida.A number of U-boats now outward-bound in the Atlantic, some near theAzores and others near the Equator, are likely to be making for the Indian Ocean.At Danzig, on the 9th, there were 70 U-boats operational, fitting-out andbuilding. At Bremen there are ten of 740 tons and ten of 1,200 tons on the slips,with ten fitting out.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. During the week U-boats, are reported to have attacked four ships, ofwhich one is known to have sunk. One ship in an outward convoy was sunk inmid-Atlantic. A U.S. ship in a westbound convoy was torpedoed oft&apos; Philippevilleand was -beached. One ship in convoy was torpedoed off the south-west coast ofIndia and a tanker was torpedoed in the Gulf of Oman.Two ships were sunk, presumably by mine, south-east of St. John&apos;s,Newfoundland.[26286]
Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending the 17th, 814 ships were convoyed. Of these,274 ships were in ocean convoys and 540 in British coastal convoys. One anti-aircraft ship, one ocean boarding vessel, 62 destroyers (including five U.S.destroyers) and 122 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including 16 TJ.S.cutters and one French sloop) were employed, on escort duties.Pour ocean convoys, consisting of 156 ships, arrived in Home Waters. Oneship was lost.British Minelaying.15. During the week aircraft laid mines off the Dutch coast, the FrisianIslands and the Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. No minelaying either by surface craft or aircraft has been reportedduring the week.During the week nine ground mines have been destroyed. During the periodthe 11th/ 13th, 82 moored mines were destroyed, 69 of which were in the Straitsof Dover.  The mine totals are 4,512 ground and 3,472 moored.17. Since the 11th. 20 mines have been destroyed off St. John&apos;s, Newfound-land, of a type similar to those laid off Halifax in May. A large dangerous areahas been declared. Dangerous areas have also been declared off Kalymnos Islandin the JEgean.Minelaying by enemy aircraft is suspected in the approaches to Madras.Enemy Merchant Shipping.18. In the Mediterranean, on the 12th, it is estimated that the Germanshad 268,000 tons of merchant shipping and 66,000 tons of tankers at their disposal.Of these totals, 67,000 tons of merchant shipping and 4,000 tons of tankers werein the iEgean and 66.000 tons of merchant shipping, with 32,000 tons of tankers,in the Adriatic. Damaged shipping, large liners and ships requisitioned fornaval purposes are not included.No Axis shipping has passed through the Dardanelles into the -TCgean sincethe middle of September.The German s.s Hochheimer (4.000 tons), in the ore trade, arrived at Bilbaoon the 16th.Italian Intelligence.19. The Italian tanker Olterra (4.995 tons), which was towed into Gibraltar,has been in use as the base from which attacks were made on shipping in GibraltarBay.  Three human torpedoes and miscellaneous diving gear were found on board.Owing to the difficulties of accommodation and victualling in Tar an to, 1,200Italian naval ratings have been authorised to return to Sicily on indefinite leave.A naval battalion has been formed in Taranto for shore service.A cruiser, two destroyers and five submarines are to act as transports inthe Mediterranean.  Six submarines have been allocated to Naples as power units.Fourteen small coastal craft in Italian Adriatic ports are to be used, with15 Yugoslav merchant ships, to maintain the Yugoslav patriot forces.Portuguese Intelligence.20. H.M. A/S trawlers Vascama and Cape Portland, at Ponta Delgada, andH.M. A/S M/S trawlers Erislcay and Gruinard, at Lisbon, have been lent to thePortuguese Government. With four more of H.M. trawlers they will be mannedby Portuguese crews with British specialists.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Velikie Luki Sector.21. The Germans have reported Russian attacks and German counter-attacks on the 18th south of Velikie Luki. but the Russians have made noreference to fighting in this area since the capture of Nevel on. the 7th.
Vitebsk Sector.22. The Russians have made further progress to within 15 miles of therai 1 way V i tebsk-0rsha.Gomel Sector.23. The Russians are now fighting in the outskirts of Gomel and havecrossed the River Soj both north and south of the town. To the south they havecrossed both the Rivers Soj and Dnieper and have captured Loev, thus establishinga bridgehead some 25 miles wide and six miles deep.Loev-Zaporozhe Sector.24. The Russians have consolidated and extended their bridgeheads acrossthe Dnieper. The exact extent of the bridgeheads at the Pripet-Dnieperconfluence and south-east of Kiev is not clear, but south-east of Kremenchug theRussians have achieved a deep penetration and have cut the railway Dniepropet-rovsk-Znamenka. The whole German position in the Dnieper bend is therebyseriously threatened.Zaporozhe-Melitopol Sector.25. The Russian attacks which the Germans had been reporting since the9th resulted in the capture of Zaporozhe on the 14th. and since then the Russianshave made some further progress south of the town. Since the 13th fighting hasbeen taking place in the streets of Melitopol, and the Russians have also cut therailway between Melitopol and the Crimea.General.26. The German positions along the Dnieper are threatened at several pointsby the bridgeheads which the Russians have been able to establish on the westbank of the river. In particular, the rapid extension of the bridgeheads south-east of Kremenchug endangers the position of the Germans at Dnepropetrovskand in the Dnieper Bend as a whole. Further south the line which the Germanshave been trying to hold in order to protect the Crimea has already been breachedat Zaporozhe and Melitopol. There can be little doubt that the Germans hoped todefend the line Dnieper-Zaporozhe-Melitopol, at least for a time, but their holdon this line has been considerably weakened by the recent Russian successes. Thereare still no indications of German evacuation of the Crimea, but several Germandivisions which were formerly in the Taman Bridgehead and the Crimea arethought to have been transferred to the Zaporozhe-Melitopol area in an attemptto stem the Russian advance.Italy.27. Progress has been made during the week against determined enemyresistance. On the right, the Eighth Army now control&apos;the road from Termoli toVinchiaturo and have patrols forward, while the Fifth Army, after hard fighting,have forced the enemy line along the River Volturno.On the east coast British troops, after holding off enemy armoured counter-attacks, have advanced and on the 19th captured Petacciato. Further inlandCanadian formations, continuing their progress in the mountains, occupiedCampobasso on the 14th and Vinchiaturo the following day. Their forwardtroops are now some 5 miles to the west of this important road.The heaviest fighting has been on the Fifth Army front, where British andU.S. forces have been fighting to cross the River Volturno against very deter-mined resistance. II.S. troops attacking north-east of Capua crossed the riverline without difficulty and have made good progress against rearguards, who have,however, been putting in constant counter-attacks supported by tanks, but havenot materially delayed their advance. They are now some 15 miles beyond theiroriginal start line, and on the 20th captured Piedimonte with their left flankapproaching Pietramelara.On the left, British troops found the river crossing at Capua impossible andhad to make use of a temporary bridge which had been constructed three milesnorth-east, of the town for their initial crossing on the 13th. They are nowstrongly established over the river in this sector, having captured Villa Volturnoon the 18th and have forward troops beyond Pignataro. Fighting here has beenvery heavy indeed and the Germans have clone their utmost to hold us up.  Further
to the left the same difficulty was experienced in getting over the river and ourarmour was unable to advance. On the 15th a small bridgehead was establishedand held at Grazzanize, but it was not until three days later that our troops wereacross in strength. In the coastal area our first attack was a complete successOur infantry crossed the river without difficulty and made contact with armouredelements which were ferried round the River Volturno and. landed over thebeaches between the mouth of the river and the canal some three miles to the northAgainst considerable opposition our troops advanced according to plan and arenow firmly established along the line of the canal.The administrative situation is improving but still presents a major problem,In the &quot; Heel.&quot; Taranto, Brindisi, and Bari are working satisfactorily, but, untiladvanced supply depots are established, the supply of our fighting formations willremain difficult. Salvage units and naval port parties have made good progresswith their task of dealing Naples Harbour.JEge&amp;n Operations.28. Little change has taken plate in the JRgenn Islands during the week.The expected enemy assault on Leros has not yet materialised, and it is appreciatedthat the delay is due partly to bad weather and partly to the damage caused byour naval and air forces to enemy shipping.The defences of Leros have been reinforced by four 25-pdr. guns and someammunition from Samos, and those of Kastelorizo have been strengthened by23 A.A. guns. The garrison of Kastelorizo has been slightly increased by troopsevacuated from the other islands.The Germans occupied the island of Naxos on the 12th with 250 men.Burma.29. Weather conditions are improving. Patrols of both sides have beenactive in all areas. In Arakan Japanese irregulars, who attached a village some20 miles north of Paletwa in the Kaladan Valley on the 12th, were beaten off.The Japanese are consolidating defence positions west of the Myittha RiverValley, to the east of the Chin Hills, but the Japanese air force has not yetappeared in the area and there is so far no evidence of any Japanese intentionto advance any further west.In the Burma-Yunnan border area the Japanese have started operationswith the apparent intention of cleaning-up the Chinese outpost and guerrillaareas west of the Salween River. Press reports of an offensive in this area appearto be exaggerated, as the Chinese themselves do not believe that a major invasionof Yunnan is likely at present.Indo-Ghina.30. A new Japanese division has arrived, increasing the estimated Japanesestrength in Inclo-China from 25,000 to 50,000.Malaya.31. It has been confirmed that a fresh Japanese division has arrived inSingapore. The estimated Japanese strength, Malaya-Sumatra-Andamans-Nicobars. is now at least 70,000.New Guinea.32. The Australian forces in the Finschhafen area have been increased totwo brigades.Before dawn on the 17th the Japanese made a small landing about five milesnorth of Finschhafen. Two of the three landing barges were disabled byAustralian artillery, and 37 Japanese were killed. The remainder of those whogot ashore were driven off to the north. Fighting continues near Sattelberg, aboutfive miles west of Finschhafen where several Japanese counter-attacks have beenbeaten off.  Japanese casualties are reported to exceed 200.In the Ramu Valley the Australian advance has been slowed down byincreased enemy resistance, difficult country, and the necessity for accumulatingsupplies. The Australian forces moving northwards from Dumpu up twotributaries of the Ramu met considerable resistance about eight miles north olDumpu. The enemy withdrew in a north-westerly direction after having sufferedheavy casualties; 407 Japanese dead have been counted in this area.
Elements of a fresh Japanese division have been identified in the Wewakarea, making- a total of four divisions in Eastern New Guinea. Two or three ofthese have, however, suffered heavy casualties, and the total strength is onlyequivalent at a maximum to three divisions.AIR SITUATION.General Review.33. Fortresses (B. 17) made a notably successful daylight attack onSchweinfurt. At night, aircraft of Bomber Command bombed Hanover andLeipzig.In Italy, enemy communications and airfields were attacked.Enemy airfields were bombed in Greece, Crete, Rhodes and Albania.Japanese aircraft suffered heavily in combat in the Pacific Zone.United Kingdom.34. In daylight two F.W. 190 reconnaissance aircraft operated briefly overthe Brixham area and were shot down on their way back. Four Me. 410s crossedthe coast near Eastbourne.At night there has been a sustained, though small-scale, offensive againstEast Anglia and Southern England, with some attempt at a small concentrationon London. In all 77 enemy aircraft were reported overland, five of which wereshot down. The bombing was of a haphazard nature which may, in part, beaccounted for by the bad&quot; weather conditions.Home Waters.35. The 17,000-ton liner Strasbourg, in tow off Ijmuiden, was attacked by27 Beaufighters of Coastal Command, with an escort of three squadrons ofSpitfires. A salvo of R.P. on the ship&apos;s stern and one R.P. on the bow were seenand are confirmed by photographs : many hits with cannon shells were alsoobserved.   Three escort vessels were damaged.   One Beaufighter is missing.Naval Albacores destroyed a minesweeper off the Somme Estuary. Typhoonsdamaged two 1,000-ton ships, two ships of 500 tons, one R-boat, one Flak ship,two barges, a tug and a dredger off the coasts of France and Holland. Spitfiresdamaged an 800-ton hopper, two motor barges and two coasters.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 67 operated, laid 263 sea-mines inenemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Daylight.36. On the 14th, important ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt wereattacked in clear weather by 255 Fortresses (B. 17), which dropped 510 tons ofbombs. Photographs taken subsequently testify to the accuracy of the attackand the damage inflicted. (Interpretations appear in Appendix VII.) Strong-air opposition was encountered; the Fortresses (B.17) provisionally claim thedestruction of 91 enemy fighters, the probable destruction of a further 25 anddamage to 12. Of the 295 bombers despatched, 59 did not return and one crashed.Penetration support over part of the route was provided by six squadrons ofThunderbolts (P. 47) and, for the loss of two aircraft, an additional 13 Germanaircraft were shot down and five were damaged. Other squadrons of fightersdetailed for withdrawal support failed to take off. owing to a depreciation inthe weather.On the 20th, 213 Fortresses (B. 17) were despatched in two forces to Duren,where the target was a non-ferrous metal plant. Ninety-two aircraft of the firstforce released about 260 tons with unknown results. Overcast weather preventedthe second force from attacking. Six Fortresses (B. 17) of the first force and.twofrom the second force are missing. Provisional claims by the bombers are twoenemy aircraft destroyed and two probably destroyed. Cover, penetration andwithdrawal support to and from the target was provided by 33 squadrons ofR.A.F. and U.S. fighters, while diversionary sweeps over the Channel and NorthFrance were carried out by 70 Liberators (B. 24) and 25 squadrons of fighters-; atotal of 18 German fighters were destroyed for the loss of three fighters, the pilotof one being safe.Operations by escorted Typhoon bombers included effective raids on airfieldsat Woensdrecht and St. Omer and on a transformer station near Boulogne, wherea direct hit was reported on the centre of the target.   Several locomotives were
damaged in the Cherbourg Peninsula and harassing attacks were carried out nearParis&quot; During these operations, nine German aircraft were destroyed for theloss of five of ours.Night.37.   Operations were limited by bad weather.On the 18th/19th, 367 Lancasters were despatched to Hanover, which wasattacked by 331 aircraft; 1,724 tons of bombs were dropped. Poor visibilityover the target prevented observation and first reports suggest that bombing wasscattered; the German communique, however, admitted &quot;considerable damagewithin the urban area.&quot; In the absence of reconnaissance photographs, resultscannot be judged; an assessment will appear in Appendix VII when photographsare available.   Seventeen Lancasters did not return from this operation.On the 20th/21st, Leipzig was the target for 358 Lancasters, 265 of whichreleased 1,013 tons of bombs. The aiming-point was obscured by thick cloudand the majority of the aircraft bombed the estimated position of the target.For this reason, no definite results were reported.  Fifteen Lancasters are missing.A total of 20 Mosquitoes made three raids on Berlin and a further 45 carriedout small-scale attacks on Dortmund, Duisburg, Emden, Stolberg, Brauweiler,Knapsack, Aachen and Dusseldorf.   Two Mosquitoes are missing.11 Intruder &quot; aircraft of Fighter Command flew 77 sorties over OccupiedTerritory; one Mosquito is missing.Italy.38. Operations, particularly those of the heavy bombers, were curtailed byunfavourable weather.On the Fifth Army front Allied fighters and fighter-bombers were very activeand enemy targets, including communications, airfields, M.T., and troop concen-trations, were attacked from the Volturno River to the north of Rome. Bridgesand roads were hit, and some M.T. vehicles destroyed; successful attacks weremade by Invaders (A. 36) on airfields near Rome, and 30 aircraft were destroyedon the ground and three others shot down in combat for the loss of one Invader(A. 36). A good attack was made on a railway tunnel S.E. of Isernia. Mediumand light bombers attacked road junctions and railways. Fighters patrolled thebattle area and carried out offensive sweeps over enemy territory. On two daysenemy fighters and fighter-bombers displayed a marked increase of activity andattempted to attack our communications and bridges across the Volturno River;Spitfires destroyed 13 enemy fighters without loss to themselves.On the Eighth Army front the coastal railway as far north as Ancona waspersistently bombed. Fighter-bombers made successful attacks on the stationand on other railway targets in the Pescara area; nine locomotives and 50wTagons were destroyed or derailed and many others were damaged. A force of36 Mitchells (B. 25) bombed the railway centre at Ancona and the target was wellcovered; the lines to Bologna and Foggia were hit and bursts were seen on arailway tunnel and among 210 units of rolling-stock, and gas works andlocomotive shops were left burning. A landing ground at Macerata (30 milesS. of Ancona) was attacked by fighter-bombers and three Ju. 52s were destroyedon the ground.Eleven Liberators made a veiw successful attack on the railway betweenAncona and Pescara; five bridges, including two road bridges, were destroyedand another was damaged.At night, Wellingtons dropped .85 tons on Civitavecchia and hit the trans-former station, barracks and a bridge. Other attacks were made on Talamone(16 miles S.S.E. of Grosseto), where the railway station was set on fire; onOrbetello where many hits were made on the railway, and on the Rome/Marcigliana airfield, where hits were obtained on hangars, buildings and 10-15aircraft.A good attack by 34 Fortresses (B. 17) was made on Terni railway centreand the target was well hit. About 45 enemy aircraft were encountered, two ofwhich were destroyed; one Fortress (B. 17) is missing.Mediterranean.Dodecanese, Crete and Greece.39. Attacks, mostly on a small scale, were directed against enemy landinggrounds. Four night raids on Maritza (Rhodes Island) &quot;were carried out byLiberators (B. 24) and Halifaxes, which dropped a total of 63 tons. Attackswere also made on Heraklion airfield (Crete) and Antimachia (Kos Island).
Argos, Sedes and Megalo Mikra (Greece) airfields were bombed by a totalof 71 Mitchells (B. 25) escorted by Lightnings (P. 38). At least 11 aircraft weredestroyed on the ground and two Me. 109s were shot down in combat; twoLightnings (P. 38) are missing.Frequent enemy attacks were made on Leros, and on two days forces ofbetween 40-50 bombers participated; at one time the harbour at Porto Lago wasunserviceable owing to delayed-action bombs. On the 17th, Kastelorizo wasbombed for the first time since occupation by nine Ju. 87s. On the following dayan attack by 10 Ju. 88s was intercepted by six Hurricanes from Cyprus, which,destroyed three of them and probably a fourth.Six Dakotas (C. 47) dropped supplies on Leros, and Halifaxes droppedsupplies for patriot forces on Greece.Albania and Yugoslavia.40. Tirana airfield was bombed by 36 Mitchells (B. 25) carrying frag-mentation bombs. Fourteen aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and workshopsand barracks were damaged. Spitfires carried out offensive sweeps and escortedshipping off the Albanian coast.Skoplje was attacked by a similar force of Mitchells (B. 25) and by 46&apos;Lightnings (P. 38). The railway centre was successfully bombed and damage was.caused to repair shops, rolling-stock and to a number of locomotives.Supplies were dropped for patriot forces.A Hacks on Shipping.41. Light Lightnings (P. 38) escorted by eight M.C. 2()5s of the Italian AirForce obtained a hit on a ship of 8,000 tons in the Levkas Channel and left her onlire.A ship of 3/4,000 tons in the Kythera Channel was torpedoed and destroyedby Wellingtons.Mitchells (B. 25) escorted by Beaufighters obtained hits on two landing crafton the north coast of Kos, and two F-boats were left emitting smoke.An attack was made on an enemy convoy off the north coast of Crete. Anarmed trawler was destroyed, a landing craft filled with personnel was hit andanother landing craft and two enemy seaplanes were destroyed.Russia..42. That the weather has not yet seriously affected Russian Air Forceoperations over the front as a whole is indicated by the day-by-day claims ofGerman aircraft destroyed, which show an increase over the previous week andamount to over 300 aircraft.The main point of effort was over the Dnieper bridgeheads, where closesupport operations have been carried on throughout the week. The RussianAir Force were also engaged in the fight for Zaporozhe; during the periodspreceding and immediately following the fall of the town a total of 65 Germanaircraft were stated to have been shot down in combat.Since the decline in strength of the G.A.F. in Russia continues, due to theneed to rest and refit units which have borne the brunt of operations since July,any increase in air support for attacks on the Russian bridgeheads can only beat the expense of other sectors of the front and must consequently lead to aweakening of German powers of resistance elsewhere. Nevertheless, it ispossible that deterioration in weather, which is already reported to have impededflying operations on certain sectors, may afford the G.A.F. some temporaryrespite.Burma.43. During the week ended the 19th, fighters made harassing raidson enemy positions in the north-west and central districts.The principal targets for our bombers were in the Mandalay and Myitky inaareas, the heaviest attacks being made on the railway centre at Naba and onSumprabum.Successful raids on river craft on the Irrawaddy were carried out.Enemy reconnaissance aircraft showed increasing activity, mainly in theImphal/Comilla area and along the Arakan coast.[26286] c
China.44. Anti-shipping operations by Mitchells (B. 25) on the 14th and 15th inthe Foochow/Amoy/Hong Kong area resulted in the sinking of one 250-foot shipand one 75-foot barge. Two large freighters were left burning and a gunboat wasdamaged. Oil dumps and warehouses at Amoy were set alight. Ten Liberators(B. 24) laid sea-mines in the shipping canal at Haiphong (Indo-China) andbombed Cat Bai airfield.On the 17th, 18 Japanese aircraft bombed Lungmoon and Kuohuk (70 and95 miles N.E. of Canton respectively); no details are available.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.45. There was considerable activity over the Lae/Oro Bay/Finschhafenareas and heavy enemy casualties in combat were reported.On the 15th, a formation of Japanese dive-bombers, with an escort of95 fighters, ineffectively attacked our rearward positions at Oro Bay.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. Incombining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in September 1943 these comprised 24 tankers of 189,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3).&quot;:).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do nottherefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on theoutward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other then United Kingdom and Eire.
