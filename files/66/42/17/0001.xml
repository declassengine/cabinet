THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT  (Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1943/SECRET   - Copy No.-W.P. (43) 487.43.WAR CABINET.October, 1943.AVAR TRANSITION PEACE.Memorandum by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.I circulate for consideration by my colleagues a statement of the broadprinciples which I suggest should guide His Majesty&apos;s Government in theirapproach to post-war problems. If these principles are accepted it will benecessary forthwith to analyse in greater detail the tasks which confront us, inorder to ensure that those preparations which must be complete by the time thewar with Germany ends, are being given priority.W. S. c. .10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.19th October, 1943.1. It is the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government to prepare for the taskswhich will fall upon us at the end of the war.   The urgent needs are :(ft) A sound scheme of demobilization, having regard to the undoubted needof our keeping considerable garrisons in enemy-occupied territory.(b) The provision of food for our Island on a scale better than the war-timerations.(c) The resumption of the export trade and the restoration of our MercantileMarine.(ft*) The general turn-over of industry from war to peace.And above all,(e) The provision during a transition period of employment for all able-bodied persons seeking it and especially for the ex-Servicemen.
Any decisions which are needed for flic supreme objects of FOOD andEMPLOYMENT in the years immediately after the war must be taken nowwhether they involve legislation and whether they are controversial or not.2. Much work has already been done on these lines by the Departments andCommittees concerned. We must be careful not to have these urgent practicalduties confused and overlaid by Party politics or held up by endless discussionsabout long-term schemes for building a new world order, &amp;c.3.   There are in fact three stages, namely :  (i) War,(ii) Transition, and(iii) Peace and Freedom.The present Government and Parliament is fully entitled to make all necessarypreparations for the Transition Period, and we should be held severelyaccountable if found in default. As early as possible in the Transition Period(for which all preparations will have been made) a General Election must be held,in order that the electors may express their will upon the form that is to be givento our post-War and post-Transition society.4. We do not know whether this election will he fought on an agreedprogramme by the Parties now composing the Coalition Government or whetherthe Leader of the majority in the present Rouse of Commons will be forced t;.place his own programme before the electors. In either case it is probable thata Four Years Plan will be announced which, apart from carrying out the enormousadministrative measures required in the Transition Period, will also comprisea series of large decisions of progress and reform which will, from one angle orthe other, shape the post-War and post-Transition Period. There will thereforebe no lack of work for the new Parliament.5. In the meanwhile, there are a number of important policies, such asEducation, Social Insurance, the Rebuilding of our shattered dwellings andcities, on which there is or may be found a wide measure of general agreement.These steps must be brought to a high degree of preparation now during the war.any necessary preliminary legislation being passed, so that they art; ready tocome into force in the early days of the Transition Period.6. It is impossible to tell how long the war against Japan will outlast I hewar against Germany. It would perhaps be safe, as a working basis, to make theTransition Period last for two years after the defeat of Germany or lour yearsfrom the 1st January, 1944. whichever period shall end the sooner.
