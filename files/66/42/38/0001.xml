(43) 488.29th October, 1943.SECRET.Copy No.WAR CABINET.EAST AFRICA.Compulsory Labour for Civilian Purposes.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.SINCE I submitted to the War Cabinet a Memorandum on this subjectthrough the Lord Privy Seal on the 16th September, I have had the opportunityof investigating the matter in East Africa as thoroughly as my short stay wouldallow. While I was there I learnt of the conclusions of the War Cabinet Meetingof the 20th September*that compulsory recruitment for essential civilian purposesshould be continued. I need only say on this point that what I saw and heardin East Africa fully convinced me of the correctness of this decision, if essentialproduction is to be maintained.2.   There are, however, the following subsidiary points :  (a) The Cabinet conclusion authorising compulsion for private industryengaged on essential war production specified two commodities, viz.,sisal and pyrethrum. It is clear that the production of essentialfood-stuffs is equally important, and no doubt other cases will arisefrom time to time when it would be desirable to add to the list. Ipropose to do this when necessary on the application of the Governorsafter consultation with the Departments here most closely concerned.(b) The Cabinet conclusion authorised the recruitment for the sisal industryin Tanganyika for a period limited to six months. This was myrecommendation, but examination on the spot has convinced me thata limit as short as this is quite impracticable in view of the longdistances which the recruit may have to travel. Moreover, theadministrative officers are unanimous that the dislocation caused byselection and recruitment should not take place at such frequentintervals. In view of the over-riding importance which the Cabinetattached to the maintenance of the production of this essentialcommodity, I have authorised the Governor to recruit for a maximumperiod of one year and I hope the Cabinet will endorse this action.3. The Cabinet at its meeting attached great importance to the limitationof private profit in those cases where compulsory labour is permitted for privateindustry, and I fully share their views. Unfortunately, I had not made itplain in my Paper the degree to which control is already exercised. In EastAfrica to-day the farmer is producing under Government control at least asstringent as that imposed on farmers in this country. He must plant what theGovernment decides and sell it at the price fixed by the Government, which isdependent, in most cases, on the prices fixed by the Ministries here. Themachinery of control, with its Production Committees and Sub-Committees, isvery much on the lines of the control by the County Agricultural Committees inthis country. The &quot;farmer has to pay Income Tax, Sur-Tax and Excess ProfitsTax at rates which, though lower than English rates, are still very substantial.Against this advantage to the farmer must be set the very much greater hazardwith which agriculture is conducted in East African conditions. The totalfailure of the rains a year ago and the present threats from locusts are significantexamples of these hazards. In accordance with Cabinet conclusion I proposeto send out a competent investigator to see whether anything further is possibleon the question of introducing safeguards such as are in force in this country,[26325]
particularly in regard to the prevention of undue profit to the employer throughthe conscript labour. But the field for further control is obviously a restrictedone.4. I propose that the investigator should at the same time report on what,if any, further improvements in the conditions of employment are immediatelypracticable. Shortage of material and difficulties of food-stuffs prevent any greatimprovement in the standard of housing or of rations. But the stringent Government inspection in connection with the small amount of conscription alreadyapplied has resulted in some improvements and some further improvement maystill be possible.Recom mendation.5. I invite my colleagues to agree to the general line of policy set out above.I feel, however, it is necessary to add a word of warning. Even with the applica-tion of compulsion the available pool of labour which can be drawn on withoutthe risk of denuding the native areas and causing starvation is very limited inKenya, and hardly less so in Tanganyika. If the Cabinet regard it as essential tomaintain the maximum production of war supplies it may be necessary in thenear future to suggest a review of the demands being made by the Army andother fighting Services upon East African man-power so as to secure a propercollation of those demands with the needs of war production.0.
