,Tc document is the PROPERTY of his britannic MAJESTY&apos;sgojternmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET.W.P. (33) 476.27/// October, 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.PLANS FOR THE TRANSITION PERIOD.Directive by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.AT their Meeting on the 21st October, the War Cabinet approved generallythe line of approach set out in my Memorandum of the 19th October (W.P. (43)467); and I undertook to circulate a further Note setting out the procedure forensuring the completion of plans for the transition period.2. The first step is to obtain a list of all the action which has to be taken,the schemes which must be prepared and the administrative arrangements whichmust be planned and organised in advance, so that when hostilities with Germanycease, the country as a whole will find that the new emergency has been foreseenand the necessary preliminary action has been taken.3. For this purpose, each Department is called upon to submit to theSecretary of the War Cabinet not later than November 10 a schedule showingall the action which they will have to take and the measures required : (a) In the period immediately after hostilities with Germany end;\b) So far as can reasonably be foreseen during the rest of the TransitionPeriod, which may be taken as a working basis as two years from thedefeat of Germany.4. The returns should cover all matters for which each Department isprimarily responsible. There are, however, numerous questions of commonconcern to many Departments which have been remitted for examination tospecial organisations or committees. In these cases, returns should be submittedby the head of the Hion or the Chairman of the committee concerned.
5.   The returns should include the following particulars :  (//) The state of preparedness of the schemes, i.e., whether they are reauynow or how long they will take to complete.(b) Points of principle on which decisions are necessary before further workcan be carried out.(c) &quot;Whether legislation by Statute, Order in Council or Defence Regulationis called for, whether such legislation has been prepared and whetherit needs to be enacted before the defeat of Germany.6. An important part of the plan will be a careful survey of the whole fieldof legislation (including Defence Regulations and other subordinate legislation)to determine which war-time powers must lie retained and which can be dispensedwith in the transitional period. This examination is already being canned outby the Committee on Emergency Legislation, under the Chairmanship ofSir Claud Schuster.II.7. The second stage will be for a general survey to be framed showing thewhole range of preparations for the transition period. At this stage, we mustmake sure that there are no gaps or contradictions between the different partsof the plan.   I will myself supervise this process.8. &quot;While the transition from peace to war differs in many respects fromthe transition from war to peace, and War Book procedure is not altogetherappropriate, it wall probably lie convenient that all Departments should have acopy of this survey to assist them in understanding how their preparations lit inwith the general scheme.An officer of high rank should be designated in each Department who shouldbe personally responsible for seeing that the schedule of the preparations, forwhich his Department is primarily responsible, is kept continuously up to dale.III.0. The third stage will be to make sure that the whole scheme is brought toa state of readinesss and is so maintained. It may be found, in the first instance,that preparatory action on a number of important matters is being delayed becausedecisions have not been reached on points of principle. I propose, when thegeneral plan has been drawn up, to preside over a series of meetings at whichthe various parts will be reviewed&apos;, and decisions thereafter obtained from theWar Cabinet on any matters which hamper the progress of preparations.W. S. C.23.1().4:i10. Downing Street, S.W. 1,27th October, 1943.
