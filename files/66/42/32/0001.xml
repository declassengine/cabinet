THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET. Copy NoW.P. (43) 482.2lst October, 1943.WAR CABINET.LONDON AIRFIELD FOR TRANSPORT SERVICES.Note by the Secretary of State for Air.1. Transport Command requires a new airfield near London capable ofaccommodating heavy transport aircraft of the latest type.2. Even now, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Transport Command,and I are gravely concerned about the inadequacy of the present facilities nearLondon for transport aircraft, and about the continued use of Flendon. TheCommanding General, United States Air Transport Command, has forbidden itsuse by Dakotas. The use of Northolt is limited by operational requirements andit cannot be adequately extended. There is, therefore, an urgent warrequirement for a new transport airfield in close proximity to London.3. Large modern airfields take so long to construct that no time must be lostin starting this project if our future needs are to be met as they arise;4. The proposal is that a main terminal airport, which is required to meetthe immediate and future military requirements of Transport Command, shouldhe constructed near London on a site which includes, but extends beyond, theexisting Heath Row airfield near Staines.5. The project is so planned that the airport could, after the war, be usedimmediately for civil transport purposes and could be developed further so as toprovide an international civil airport for the capital of the Empire, which wouldbe capable of accommodating the largest post-war types of long-distance aircraft.Unless we take steps to plan for such an airport now, our civil aviation will beseriously handicapped by the lack of this essential asset in the post-war period.6. I do not ask that this further development should be put in.hand at thisstage. It can. with advantage, wait until more precise information is availableabout post-war civil requirements.7. Accordingly, I only ask the War Cabinet at this stage to approve themilitary requirements set out in the attached memorandum, i.e., Stages 1 and 2.8. I recommend, however, that the Ministry of Town and Country Planningshould be asked to take steps under their existing powers to sterilise theadditional land which would be required for the civil scheme, i.e., Stage 3.9. These proposals touch the activities and interests of many Departments.They involve disturbance and heavy cost. - Nevertheless, I ask the War Cabinetto endorse them as the only practicable means of meeting present militaryrequirements and, in addition, to authorise the. Ministry of Town and CountryPlanning to take such action now as will make it possible in the future to developthe potentialities of the new airport to the full in the interests of civil airtransport.A.

LONDON AIRFIELD FOR TRANSPORT SERVICES.Memorandum by the Air Ministry.1. It is necessary, owing to the increasing number and size of aircraft, toprovide Transport Command at once with improved terminal facilities in thiscountry for long-distance air routes.2. At present, the terminal airports for the western and southern airroutes used by all British and American ferry and transport aircraft to andfrom the United Kingdom are Prestwick, in Ayrshire, and Lyneham, in Wilt-shire, respectively, with smaller airfields at Nutts Corner (Northern Ireland) andValley (Anglesey) for minor traffic; and to these, St. Mawgan, in Cornwall, hasrecently been added to cope with the increased trans-Atlantic traffic. Theseairfields are all operating nearly to the maximum of their present capacityand traffic is growing steadily. There is no terminal of any consequence in theeast of England, as all the major airfields in that area are required by BomberCommand or the VHIth United States Air Force, and none could, in any case,be used by the very large transport aircraft for which we are planning withoutextensive and costly reconstruction. This reconstruction could not, of course, beundertaken before the end of the German war.3.   The existing facilities are not adequate to meet essential needs.   Thus : (a) It is an increasingly important function of Transport Command tocarry by air to all quarters of the globe members of the Government,the heads of the three Services, the Commanders in the field and theirstaffs, high civil officials and the members of political and operationalmissions. Their journeys invariably begin or end at London, andtime is usually of great importance. Accordingly, a shuttle service isat present operated from London to the airfield of departure. Theoperation of such a service, however, involves loss of time: andconsiderably increases the risks of delay, since account must be takenof weather conditions both at the London airfield and at the long-distance terminal.Moreover, the London airfields at present available for this workare already unsuitable for even the medium type of transport aircraft.Croydon is confined to limits which are long out of date. ITendon isincapable of extension, and is so risky for Dakotas (the medium twin-engine type standard to the Americans and ourselves) that theCommanding General of the United States Air Transport Commandhas forbidden his Dakota pilots to use it. Northolt, Hornchurch,Biggin Hill, Kenley and Heston, are all required for operations.(b) Aircraft of the heavy transport types, now coming into operation, willrequire runways of 3.000 yards length and of stronger concrete con-struction than has hitherto been employed. It is anticipated that the250,000-Ib. transport aircraft will be in use by 1946; and for this typerunways of 5,000 yards are considered necessary, if all-weather servicesare to be maintained. The main runway at St. Mawgan cannot,however, be extended beyond 3,000 yards, or that at Lyneham bevond3.200 yards; and while the main runway at Prestwick could beextended to about 5 miles, extension beyond 3,000 yards would involvemajor works in carrying it over a road and. railway. Moreover, thisairfield is 350 miles from London.4. For these reasons, the construction of a new large airfield near Londonfor our own use and that of the U.S.A.T.C. is urgently needed. Such a projectis ambitious, and involves surmounting many difficulties. Though bold, however,it is the proper answer to&apos;the question which now faces us.5. Exhaustive search in the London area shows only one district suitablefor an airfield of the dimensions required the triangle formed by the Bath Roadand. South-Western Road (A. 10), from their junction atCranford to a line justeast of Stanwell, the whole lying just north-east of Staines (see map attached).This district, which includes the present Heath Row airfield, is well graded andwell served by road and rail communications.
6.   The requirements of Transport Command cover two Stages :  (a) Stage 1, which should be started as soon as possible and will take at least14 months to complete, requires an area of 2,150 acres, giving runways,3,000, 2,000 and 2,000 yards long. At a very rough estimate the costwill be  5 million. At this stage it will be necessary to demolish about130 houses and to provide alternative accommodation; and some8 factories and works (including 3 gravel works) will also have to bedemolished. A large gasometer at Southall, now empty, will have to beremoved, as it constitutes a flying obstruction at this stage.(b) Stage 2, which should follow immediately Stage 1 is complete, will coveranticipated Service needs up to 1948, based on the expected increase inthe size of aircraft. It involves expanding the Stage 1 area to.3,050 acres, giving runways 5,000, 3,000 and 3,000 yards long. It willentail an additional estimated cost of about  2,750,000. It will benecessary at this stage to demolish a further 58 houses and providealternative accommodation, besides demolishing 4 more factories andworks. It will, moreover, be necessary at this stage to use the land atpresent occupied by the Middlesex County Councihs sludge disposalworks at Ferry Oaks. These works cost about  500,000 to constructshortly before the war began; and, as this construction is understoodto have taken two years, the removal of the works to another site willhave to be put in hand at the inception of Stage 1 in order to avoiddelay at Stage 2.7. The completion of Stages 1 and 2 will provide a first-class airfield nearLondon, capable of handling the heaviest types of transport aircraft, and ofmeeting war-time needs up to 1948.8. An airfield of this kind will be urgently required after the war, whenthe provision of an international airport for London wall be essential to theinterests of British civil aviation. London will be, inter alia, an importantmain line terminal for connecting the European system with the trunk routesto other parts of the world. Failure to seize, the present opportunity of provid-ing it with an airport which can, and will, become the -most important Europeaninternational airport, would be a calamity for British Civil Aviation.It would therefore be prudent, in planning the service airfield which isnow required for military purposes, to make provision for later expansion tomeet the requirements of a modern civil airport, with multiple runways capableof accommodating dense traffic. Such a step cannot be taken until the war isover; but Stages 1 and 2, as described in paragraph 6 above, will not only meetthe military requirements which now face us. but provide the foundation forthis post-war civil aviation development. There is, therefore, a potential post-war Stage 3 to be considered. The cost, additional to that of the expandedmilitary airfield, would be in the neighbourhood of  15,400,000; and at thisstage it would be necessary to demolish a further 1,373 houses and 47 otherbuildings, including a number of factories, shops, garages, a school and a chapel,9. In the United States, as might be expected, terminals capable of handlingthe international air traffic of the future are being planned on the boldest lines.An airport for New York, six times larger than the present La Guardia air-held, is now under construction at Icllewild. The present plans provide forrunways of 3,300 yards, but as the airfield is being built on reclaimed land, it iscapable of almost indefinite extension. At the new airport in the west at LongBeach, California, runways 4,700 yards long are projected.10. These proposals involve much disturbance and heavy cost, and theyaffect many Departments. Reference has been made in paragraph 6 to thoseaspects which primarily concern the Ministry of Health the rehousing ofcivilians and the removal of the Middlesex County Councils sludge disposalworks; and also to a matter of interest to the Ministry of Fuel and Power theremoval of the large gasometer at Southall. The Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries are concerned about the effect of the proposals on food production andpost-war agriculture. There will be a considerable demand on labour andmaterials. For the construction of the airfield and its buildings, 2,000 men willbe wanted at the beginning of Stage 1, increasing later to 3,000 men; and furtherlabour will be required for rehousing civilians, for reconstructing the sludgedisposal works, and for other incidental works. The Electricity Commissionerswill require to put underground the 2\ miles of grid running north from Staines
Reservoir. It will be necessary for the Ministry of Aircraft Production to makealternative arrangements for the Fiairey Aviation Company, which at presentuses part of the area as a testing ground. The Ministry of War Transportsplans for the Bath Road and the South-Western Road, and those of the Ministryof Town and Country Planning for post-war planning in general will be affected.Other Departments also are concerned. The estimates of cost given in thismemorandum are inclusive, i.e., they make full provision for land purchase andcompensation payments, for the cost of rehousing civilians, and for expenditurein carrying out other works under the proposals. The heavy cost at Stage 1 islargely due (apart from land purchase and compensation payments, and rehousinpcosts) to the extra runway strength required for the heavier aircraft expectedat subsequent stages which cannot satisfactorily be provided by over-layingmore concrete on existing runways.11. Despite the considerable disturbance and cost involved, it is consideredthat operational . requirements coupled with the important considerationsregarding post-war civil aviation call for the execution of Stages 1 and 2, andthat Stage 1 should be begun as soon as possible. In this event, the Air Ministrywill forthwith requisition all the land required for Stages 1 and 2, and willarrange to take possession as and when the work of construction so requires. Thiswill enable the maximum notice to be given to present occupiers. The land willsubsequently be purchased under such powers as may be obtained when theAcquisition of Land Bill becomes law. In addition, it is contemplated that theMinistry of Town and Country Planning should use their existing powers tosterilise any land required for Stage 3, over and above the land which can berequisitioned for military purposes at Stages 1 and 2. Any land so sterilisedmight subsequently be purchased by the Ministry of Town and Country Planning,on behalf of the Air Ministry, under such legislative powers as may later beconferred.Air Ministry, 21st October, 1943.
