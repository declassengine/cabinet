THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 453.13th October, 1943.X   / &apos;WAR CABINET.GOVERNMENT BUILDING PROGRAMME.PROPOSALS FOR PERIOD OCTOBER-DECEMBER 1943.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.Results for period January to September 1943.1. Throughout this period the allocations have generally worked out verysatisfactorily, and no Department has been materially short of its approveddemands, except the Air Ministry from July onwards. This result has beensecured by the close co-operation between the Ministry of Labour and theMinistry of Works and the various Departments, and in spite of the fact thatthe building industry as a whole lost about 10.000 more men than had beenallowed for during the 12 months preceding the July return of insurance cards.The losses in mobile workers have been very serious, and it has become more andmore difficult to find the men for Government works, especially in areas such asEast Anglia.2. In W.P. (43) 196 setting out the proposed allocations for the periodApril to September 1943 it was contemplated that the number of men availablefor the Government building programme as a whole would fall from 346.000 atthe end of April to 280.000 at the end of September. The War Cabinet decidedon the 3rd June to postpone the call-up of some 15,000 men. and it might thereforehave been expected that the total labour force available at the end of Septemberwould amount to 295.000. The latest estimates suggest that the actual numberemployed on the Government building programme at that date was about 287.000.3. For convenience in the administration of the allocations, it is proposedfor future periods to include as part of the labour required for the Governmentbuilding programme the labour employed on maintenance by the Air Ministry,Ministry of Supply, Ministry of Aircraft Production. Ministry of WarTransport and Ministry of Works. (Labour employed on maintenance by theAdmiralty and War Office had already been included.) The volume of labour thusemployed by these five Departments is about 35,000 men. so that the numberemployed on the Government building programme as a whole in this wider senseat the end of September was about 322,000.Resources available for the period October-December 1943.4. During this period net wastage is estimated at 21,000, while about4.000 18-year-olds will be due for calling up. Against this it is hoped to make12,000 men available for the Government building programme by continuing thepresent reduction in the number of men allowed for civilian maintenance&quot; andsmall works. Thus the number of men available for the Government programmewill fall by the end of the year to 309,000. Ff in addition the Forces take the15,000 men whose call-up has been temporarily postponed and the 4,000 labourersdue for call-up under existing arrangements (19,000 together) the total will fallto 290,000 at the end of December.5.   It was hoped that we should find it possible to proceed with the call-upas planned during the last quarter of the year, if the Americans could bepersuaded to bring over additional constructional troops.   They are. in fact,[262261
obringing over more men than had previously been planned, though hot as manyas we suggested, but the additional arrivals seem likely to be largely counter-balanced by additional operational requirements. Furthermore, while theAmericans are not asking us to take on more works for them, they are askingus to make more men available for works to which we are already committed.This matter is being separately investigated, and no allowance is made in mypresent proposals for meeting any such additional demands.Proposals for the period October-December 1943.6. I am bound to recommend that the 19,000 men referred to in paragraph 4above should not be called up during the quarter because demands on both Britishand United States labour are now- higher than was anticipated. The tablein the Annex shows that, even if these men are not called up, I am unable topropose meeting any of the departmental demands in full and I am unable torecommend any larger allocation than is proposed in the table for Civil Depart-ments as a group. Some risk of delays must therefore inevitably be accepted,but my provisional information is that, if labour is made available for the ServiceDepartments as proposed in this paper, there should be no serious failure incompleting by the due dates the works required by the Americans for which wehave accepted responsibility, as well as our own requirements.A dditional operational requirements.7. It is highly likely that there will be additional requirements for opera-tional purposes calling for an urgent allocation of building labour during thenext few months. One such demand, which might involve 10,000 to 12.000 menin November and December, is at present under examination. I have been unableto allowr any reserve for meeting such demands and. if they in fact arise, workon the rest of the programme will have to suffer some delay so that the necessarynumber of men can be made available.Re co mm en d a t ion.8. I therefore ask the War Cabinet to agree that no further men should becalled up from the building industry during the current quarter and to approvethe Departmental allocations shown in the Annex to this paper, on the under-standing that they may need to be modified to provide labour for newrequirements for urgent operational purposes.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,nth October. 1943.
