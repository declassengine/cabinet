(43) 461.ISth October, 1943.WAR CABINET.UNITED NATIONS RELIEF AND REHABILITATIONADMINISTRATION.INSTRUCTIONS TO UNITED KINGDOM REPRESENTATIVES.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Production&apos;, President of Board ofTrade axo Minister of State.1. The draft Agreement establishing the United Nations Relief andRehabilitation Administration will be signed in Washington on the 9th November.On the following day the Council of UNRRA, which consists of representativesof all the signatories&apos; will assemble in Atlantic City to discuss for three weeks orso the policy, method of operation and organisation of the new body. This firstmeeting of the Council will therefore be of great importance. The UnitedNations will have agreed to set up UNRRA with a charter the interpretation ofwhich has already given rise to some debate and it will be for the first meetingof the Council to decide how it is to operate.2. Hitherto we have felt some difficulty in making up our minds about theway in which UNRRA should operate because we were not fully informed ofthe views of the Americans. It becomes clear from the Minister of State&apos;sconversations in Washington (see Annex I) that the State Department aredefinitely in favour of a narrow conception of UNRRA; there is reason to supposethat the American Supply Departments take the same view and evenGovernor Lehman does not press for the wide interpretation of the role ofUNRRA which some of his assistants would advocate. Mr. Law was able to workout with representatives of the State Department and Governor Lehman amemorandum on the scope and operations of UNRRA. It appears from telegram4636 that this memorandum will form the basis for the instructions to the UnitedStates Delegation. We suggest that this memorandum, a copy of which appearsas Annex II to this note, should be regarded as the basis of the instructions to theUnited Kingdom representative on the UNRRA Council and his delegation.3. It is to be hoped that as a result of Mr. Law&apos;s talks in Washington ourrepresentatives and the United States representatives will go to Atlantic Citywith similar basic instructions. This is most important. At the same time wemust be careful to avoid any impression, of trying to push an Anglo-Americanpill down the throats of the smaller nations to say nothing of the Russians andthe Chinese. Opinions differ as to the probable reaction of the other nations. Wethink it will be generally agreed, however (a) that UNRRA should lie put into a position to see that a fair distributionof the available supplies is made as between liberated territories and,in particular, that the countries which can pay do not get too muchat the expense of those which cannot; and(b) that the allocation and supply machinery which has been built up bythe British. Commonwealth and the United States for the prosecutionof the war should lie maintained at any rate until after the defeatof Japan, and that the operations of UNRRA, which will be aclaimant on supplies and shipping, should be organised to make themaximum use of this machinery.These   principles  can   be  applied   in   more   than   one  way.    The   mannersuggested in the memorandum reproduced as Annex II seems to present aworkable solution if the Allied Governments Avill agree to it.   The salient[262591
points of this scheme are that UNRRA should work all down the line inclose collaboration with the representatives of the Combined Boards and theBritish and American supply departments, that Allied Governments should beencouraged to distribute supplies themselves and generally to stand on theirown feet as much as possible, that UNRRA should be given power to approveor disapprove all requirements from liberated territories before they arepresented to the Combined Boards, and that those restored local Governmentswhich can pay for their requirements should be encouraged to enter into directrelations with the supply authorities. If the Allies will not agree to the proposalswe may have to accept modifications, but we feel the British member of theCouncil should be instructed to report home by cable before accepting substantialmodification of this general scheme.4. We do not know exactly what attitude the Russians will take about theoperation of UNRRA. We understand that they have informed the Americansunofficially that they will expect to obtain large quantities of supplies(89.000.000.000 has been mentioned), but that they will not look to UNRRA toprovide them. Doubtless they will want to continue a Protocol procedure, andit is hardly to be expected that any examination of Russian requirements on thespot will be possible either on the part of UNRRA or any other external authority.The Chinese also may well say that their requirements cannot be drawn throughUNRRA. In which case the four Great Powers will all be standing out. Wethink it wisest to realise from the start that these countries and probably others,such as the French and the Belgians, will desire direct contact with the supplyauthorities.   This is what is suggested in Annex II.5. The exact manner in which the proposals in Annex II are to tie putforward at the Council meeting will have to be determined in the light ofcircumstances at the meeting. In particular the proposal that representativesof the United Kingdom and United States supply departments should beassociated with the local examination of requirements may excite opposition ifput forward, too dogmatically.0. In all these matters it should, we suggest, lie ihe policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that UNRRA should be given a real task to perform, which willmake the Allied Governments feel that it is a useful instrument in which theyhave full share, but at the same time we should resist any tendency to magnifyUNRRA into a great international authority controlling the economic life ofEurope or the world, and should concentrate on giving it powers which it canperform without overreaching itself and without upsetting the allocation andsupply machinery, which we must preserve for war purposes.7. One of the subjects which will be discussed is that of finance. TheTreasury will, we understand, be represented at Atlantic City. . Mr. Law andLord Keynes discussed informally with United States officials a plan suggestedby Dr. Harry White of the United States Treasury, whereby each nation wouldagree that it would contribute free goods and services up to 1 per cent, of itsnational income. This general approach to the problem seems to us to havegreat political attractions and to offer fewer practical difficulties than anyalternative From the United Kingdom point of view it would make itunnecessary for us to finance the purchase of goods elsewhere than in the sterlingarea (except to such extent as we may agree to provide a portion of our contribu-tion in &quot; free exchange &quot;). The discussions on this matter in Washingtoncarried no commitment of any kind. Nevertheless, we are glad to note that theChancellor of the Exchequer has recently authorised a cable to his representa-tives in Washington, instructing them to continue discussions on this generalline.8. We have not referred in this note to what should be said on the subjectof the actual supplies which can be provided for relief purposes. It would bepreferable if this topic could be deferred for discussion between, say, the UNRRACommittee on Supplies and the Combined Boards. But it is hardly to beimagined that Allied Governments will allow the Council meeting to disbandwithout some discussion on the subject. On the other hand neither we nor theUnited States can be rushed into hasty decisions on the provision of such thingsas food at the expense of our own population. In these circumstances the UnitedKingdom representatives should, we suggest, be instructed to discuss the generalsupply position only with the Allies and to make clear to them the seriousshortages which will prevail. Such general discussion should be a usefulintroduction to more detailed discussion later.
9. We have been asked to nominate the United Kingdom representative onthe Council of UNRRA and on the Central Committee of four Powers. Wehave consulted those of our colleagues most concerned and we recommend thatthe Minister Resident in Washington for Supply should be appointed to this post.Since the meeting to take place at Atlantic City will be the first meeting ofthe Council it follows that Colonel Llewellin would be the chief United Kingdomrepresentative at this meeting. This would be very appropriate since our chiefrepresentative should be a Minister of the Crown and should have experienceof the working of the supply machine. The Minister will require an alternateas a member of the Council and a deputy as head of the United Kingdom Delega-tion. We propose that Sir F. Leith-Ross, whose presence at Atlantic City willin any case be necessary in virtue of his chairmanship of the Inter-AlliedCommittee, should occupy this position. It will be necessary to appoint Britishrepresentatives to various other posts. e.g., to the Committee on Supplies. Wesuggest that it should be left to Colonel Llewellin to make recommendationson the filling of these posts. It would, of course, be clear that any British officialswho joined the staff of UNRRA could not represent His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton any of the Committees.10. It has already been agreed by Ministers (see GEN 6/3rd Meeting) thatthe responsibility for &quot; Relief &quot; (as distinct from the supplies to meet it) shouldbe transferred from the President of the Board of Trade to the Foreign Secretaryat an appropriate time. We think that this time has now come and we proposethat the Foreign Office should henceforth assume responsibility for the Delegationand its arrangements.11. As regards the composition of the Delegation to the Council meeting atAtlantic City, we feei that matters of such importance will be discussed thata strong Delegation should be chosen. Colonel Llewellin will no doubt wish tohave with him representatives from the Embassy and from the Missions. Wefeel it to be important that a balanced Delegation should be collected. It shouldcontain representatives of the Departments most concerned from London as wellas from the Washington Missions, in order to ensure proper continuity ofexperience. We think that the Treasury. Foreign Office, Relief Department,Ministry of Food. Ministry of Production (or Supply). Ministry of WarTransport, Dominions Office and Ministry of Health should be represented eitherby officials from London or Washington, or both12.   To sum up :  (1) We ask the War Cabinet to approve this note and Annex II asinstructions for the United Kingdom representatives attending thefirst session of the UNRRA Council at Atlantic City.(2) We ask approval for the appointment of the Minister Resident inWashington for Supply as United Kingdom member of the UNRRACouncil.O.

ANNEX I.Memorandum by the Minister of State.BEFORE I went to Washington it had become clear that no further progresscould he made in London in working out how UNRRA would operate becausethere was a difference of opinion between Departments on what the scope ofUNRRA should be. Ministers had two shots at reaching some conclusions onthis (see GEN (i meetings), but on each occasion decided that it was no usetrying to make up our minds here without knowing more about how Americanswere thinking on the subject. Accordingly, I was asked to find out what theAmerican view was and see how far we could reach agreement. The position wasthat we were committed to the draft UNRRA Agreement, which is, I believe,capable of very varied interpretation, and the immediate problem was to reachsome understanding with the Americans on the meaning which we should like tosee given to it when the time came to discuss this with the United Nations.It seemed to me that the objectives I should keep before1 me in my discussionswere :  (a) That since UNRRA would in any case have to be established, it shouldbe given a real job to do which would make it a good example of UnitedNations&apos; collective action.(b) That the allocation and supply machinery built up during the war mustbe preserved until the end of the war against the Japanese and intothe aftermath, so that UNRRA must be so designed as to make useof this machinery to the greatest extent possible.It became apparent as soon as I began to talk about the subject of thescope of UNRRA in Washington that the Americans, on their side, had reachedno conclusions on the subject. At the same time it was (dear that the trend ofopinion in the State Department was strongly in favour oi&apos; limiting the scopeof UNRRA largely for the same reasons as prompted our own SupplyDepartments to lake a similar attitude. Some members of the State Departmentwere also wondering whether it was really necessary to have an UNRRA at all,Acheson. who had negotiated the draft Agreement on the American side, felthimself to be in an acutely embarrassing position, lie had previously refrainedfrom thinking out how his creation was going to work and. now that he wasbrought to the point, the more he thought about it the more be felt that be shouldbackwater. At the same time he realised that he had committed his Governmentto UNRRA and must therefore make a success of it. id is method of showing hisembarrassment was to accuse IS is Majesty&apos;s Government of similar inconsistency.At my first discussion with Acheson we went over the ground trying to reachsome conclusions on the meaning to be attached to the words &quot;Relief andRehabilitation&quot; in the draft UNRRA Agreement. Mis attitude, roughlyspeaking, was that &quot; Relief &quot; was fairly easy to define, ft meant the provision ofessential consumption goods, food, clothing, medical supplies, &amp;c, to the needy.But &quot;Rehabilitation&quot; must be defined to mean something which furthered aprogramme of relief by the local production of relief goods. He made it clearthat he did not think that &quot; Relief and Rehabilitation &quot; covered the whole importprogramme of the liberated territory, or anything like it. Following thisdiscussion I wrote Acheson a letter putting down wdiat I thought were theconclusions of the discussion we had had. Shortly after this letter was receivedthere was a reorganisation on the American side, and Acheson bad furtherdiscussions with his colleagues and with Governor Lehman&apos;s people. As a result,when I next saw him he produced some thoughts of his own which were somewhatdifferent in that he gave up the attempt to define Relief and Rehabilitationand concentrated on defining the job to be undertaken by UNRRA, distinguishingbetween what it would do in the ease of countries which could pay for theirsupplies and countries which could not. In this he was prompted, I think, bythe finance scheme, which had been worked out by Dr. Harry White of the UnitedStates Treasury, and also by Governor Lehman&apos;s emphasis upon UNRRA asan organisation for ensuring fair distribution of supplies between the variousliberated territories rather than as a large organisation operating in the field.Following this a meeting was arranged at which Governor Lehman was present,and at this we discussed with the Governor the main principles on which woshould work in attempting to produce a scheme of the extent and manner of
UNRRA&apos;s operation. These principles, which I set out in telegram No. 4501to the Foreign Office, were as follows :-(a) UNRRA will be concerned with supplies and services essential to healthand stability of populations of liberated areas, and not with long-range reconstruction or local production for war purposes.(//) It will be necessary to preserve combined board allocation machinery.(c) Funds must be made available under UNRRA control to finance suppliessent to countries which cannot pay for them.(d) UNRRA will have to have power to prevent liberated territories whichcan pay from getting too much at expense of non-paying countries.U) As much use as possible should be made of supply-purchasing andhandling machinery built up in war, and United States and UnitedKingdom supply agencies will need direct representation in liberatedterritories.(/) Governments of liberated territories should be encouraged to do as muchas possible for themselves, eg., in distribution. This would be subjectto right, of UNRRA to sec that goods were properly used.(g) Susceptibilities of Governments which can pay should be met as far asis compatible with (d).There was general agreement on these principles. We volunteered to producea memorandum incorporating them and setting out how we thought the machineshould work in order to put them into effect. This we did and on the followingday a further meeting took place at which our memorandum was discussed.Several points were raised which had not been sufficiently clearly expressed in thememorandum to command immediate agreement and there was one point on whichGovernor Lehman was not happy, namely, the manner in which programmes ofrequirements for countries which were in a position to pay should pass from therecipient country to the supply allocating authorities. There was complete agree-inent between us that on this matter our object should be to give UNRRA thefullest authority to sponsor or to object to these requirements in order to dischargeits obligation to see that the distribution of supplies between liberated territorieswas fair and also at the same time to meet as far as possible the susceptibilitiesof Governments which were in a position to pay and anxious to assert themselveson restoration to their full sovereignty. We felt that the right way of doing thiswas to give people like the French direct access to the supply authorities but togive UNRRA a chance to exercise their veto or to give their support. Some ofLehman&apos;s people however felt that the susceptibility of these Governments wouldbest be met if all their requirements were communicated to UNRRA and passedby them to the Combined Boards. On this our view was strongly supported bythe State Department and we reached the position finally that Lehman acceptedour memorandum. He did so I believe with the feeling that the point on whichthere had been disagreement was one which would be discussed at the meeting;of the UNRRA Council, and since we did not suggest that the Allied Govern-ments should be coerced into one system or the other the question would bedecided largely by what the Allies would be prepared to accept.The memorandum, as amended after discussion, wras then sent to Achesonwith a letter explaining the point at which there had been disagreement andsetting out our views on it. This memorandum and letter which have already beencirculated in London as paper N.A.S. (43) 68, are reproduced herewith asAnnex II.Just before my leaving for London I was able to talk to Stettinius, the newlyappointed tinder-Secretary of State. When we came to discuss the UNRRAConference it was clear that his own views tended towards a narrow scope forUNRRA and, that in particular he thought its activities should be strictly limitedon the rehabilitation side. Acheson arid I explained to him the lines on which wehad been discussing the matter with Governor Lehman and Stettinius asked fora summarised version of our memorandum which he could put before the Presidentwithin a day of its becoming a directive on the American side. Telegram 4636from Washington, which has now come in. shows that Stettinius has discussed thiswith the President who has also tended towards the narrow view of UNRRA.When.I left Washington it had not been decided who was to be the UnitedStates representative on the UNRRA Council. It had. I think, been assumed bysome that Mr. Sayre. Governor Lehman&apos;s deputy, would occupy this position,but itwas becoming clear to the State Department and others that it was necessary tohave somebody with a clear line authority who could represent the views of the[20259] c
United States Government. Mr. Sayre, who had no Department, could hardlydo this and in any case his appointment would lay them open to the suggestionthat the Director-General controlled one of the votes at the Central Committee.I felt myself and still feel that the State Department should provide the UnitedStates representative on the UNRRA Council since I believe that only in thisway shall we avoid recurrent disagreements between QNRRA and the UnitedStates Government and only in this way can the Americans be made to place anytrust in UNRRA as an organisation.Apart from the question of American representation it seems to me certainthat at the Conference at Atlantic City the United Kingdom Delegation will becalled upon to [day a very delicate hand. They will, on the one band, have toresist a tendency on the part of some of I he more enthusiastic Americans tomagnify UNRRA into an organisation attempting to control the economic life ofthe United Nations and on the other to prevent other American Departments fromreacting so strongly from this idea that they try to whittle down the functions ofUNRRA to the point at -which the other United Nations wish to withdraw fromit. They will have to resist these tendencies because the magnified UNRRA willnot be allowed to work by the American agencies who will exercise the dominantvoice in the provision of cash and supplies and because it would be essential, atthe same time, to make UNRRA do a respectable job which will be a goodadvertisement for the United Nations, even if this job is something less thansome people have at one time thought of. It is. I believe, a fact that the widerUNRRA would not be allowed to work. It is also, however, in our own interestthat the organisation should not magnify itself in the way in which some peopledesire since this would almost certainly lead to the demand that our own suppliesshould be obtained through UNRRA. The serious objections to this are obviousand have already &quot;been pointed out at the War Cabinet (see W.M. (4:)) 91stConclusions. Item 1).ANNEX II.Copy of Letter from Mr. R. Law to Mr. D. Acheson.oth October, 194:).1 enclose a copy of the memorandum on the &quot; Scope and Operations ofUXRtiA &quot; which we discussed on Saturday in Governor Lehman&apos;s room andwhich has since been revised in the light of the discussion. It seems to me thatwe reached almost complete agreement on that occasion. Yon will rememberthat the point on which the Governor laid most stress was the necessity ofUNRRA having the power to veto or reduce demands put in by liberatedterritories, whether or not they could pay. We entirely agree that, subject tooverriding military necessity, this is a necessary power if UNRRA is to be ableto see that supplies are fairly distributed between the various liberated territories.I think our agreement on this point is made clear in the revisions made in thememorandum.Thertris. however, one point of importance on which I do not think all thosepresent iast Saturday reached agreement. This point concerns the bestmechanism through which to handle the requirements of those Governments whichhave funds and are anxious on restoration to full sovereignty to assert theirposition in the world. I think we are all agreed that our aim must be to meetthe susceptibilities of these Governments so far as we can. while retaining thaicontrol over the allocation of resources which we must preserve for war purposes,but at the same time to maintain the authority of UNRRA to veto or cut downthe demands of these countries, should this be necessary to promote a fairerdistribution. In my view we shall be most likely to retain the co-operation ofsuch Governments if we are prepared to admit them to direct consultation withthe authorities controlling the supplies. I have little doubt that it will be theaim of such Governments to get a seat on the Combined Boards. Failing that,I think they would press for a form of association with the Combined Boardssuch that they could be sure of being consulted when their interests wereconcerned. It is for this reason that we have made certain proposals to theState Department in connection with the French National Committee inparticular, and with other third countries in general. We believe that thisgeneral approach is more likely to be found satisfactory and to form a sounderbasis for future development than would a system by which all Governments of
liberated territories were forced to channel their demands in respect of territoriesliberated after the 9th November, 1943, through UNRRA, and, unlike thoseliberated before that date were deprived of direct access to the supply authorities.I think this question is a straightforward political issue. There is, of course, noquestion of coercing a Government into one method or the other&apos;. I think,however, that this is a kind of question on which it is most important that thepolitical thinking of our two Governments should not be in disagreement. Itwould. I think, be most unfortunate if we advocated different policies at theUNRRA Council table.I should like to suggest, for your consideration that we might have a wordwith Mr. Stettinius on the subject and that after that you should let me knowwhether the views of your Government are in accord with those in the enclosedmemorandum. This would enable me on return to London to give the Depart-nients concerned a basis for their further thoughts between now and the9th November.(Signed) RICHARD LAW.Memorandum ox Tin-: Scope and Operations of UNRRA.A. Principles.1. The purpose of setting up LNRRA is to help liberated territories tosecure those supplies and services which are essential for the health and stabilityof their populations and which cannot be provided by other means. It must seethat succour is brought to the needy. The supplies and services it will beinterested - in, therefore, will be in the main consumption goods for the localpopulation and such additional supplies as arc required to enable local produc-tion to provide for consumption needs which would otherwise call for imports.Long-range reconstruction and production for war purposes will not be its task.2. The period during which UNRRA is active will be one during which,because of the war, or the dislocation caused by the Avar, many essential supplieswill be critically scarce and in which demands upon shipping and other forms oftransport will lie greater than can be satisfied. Scarce supplies and shippingwhich are used for the supply of any liberated territory will mean that less areavailable, not only for other liberated territories, but also for the fighting servicesand for the populations which are maintaining the armies of the United Nations.It will be necessary, therefore, to maintain the allocation machinery which hasbeen built up round the Combined Boards and with which the principal supplyingnations are associated.3. Certain liberated countries will have little or no foreign exchange withwhich to finance essential imports and it will be necessary for funds or creditsto be provided at the disposal of UNRRA out of which supplies and servicescan be financed for countries which cannot pay.4. Other liberated territories will be able to pay for their own imports andthere will be a tendency for these countries to attempt to procure supplies whichwould otherwise be available for countries which are not able to purchase forthemselves. It will be an essential part of the functions of UNRRA to see thatcountries which cannot pay obtain a fair deal and are not deprived of suppliesthrough the heavy demands of the countries which can pay. It will be necessary,therefore, for UNRRA to have complete knowledge of the import demands filedby all liberated territories, whether-or not they can be paid for, and to be in aposition in which it can if necessary prevent the submission of excessive demandsto the allocating authorities.5. It will be desirable that the greatest possible use be made of the world-wide supply purchasing and handling and ship operating and routeing organisa-tions which have been built up during the four years of war by the Governmentsof the United States and the British Commonwealth. This machinery is gearedto the allocation machinery referred to in 2 above and will in any case have toremain in operation until-the end of the war in the Far East and for some periodthereafter. A duplication of it would lead to confusion and waste of resources.The supply agencies (in conformity with policies established by the CombinedBoards) will moreover be directly concerned with the development of local industryand resources in liberated territories and (in collaboration with the localauthorities) with mobilising them as far as possible for the war effort or to relieveoverall shortages. For this reason representatives of the United States and[20259] c 2
United Kingdom Governments will be associated with the local authorities inorder to assist them to procure and ultilise certain raw materials, industrial equip-ment. &amp;c. Such representatives will be concerned with the development ofsources of supply for purposes other than relief. These representatives and thoseof UNRRA should be instructed to work out their exact division of functionin any area in the light of local circumstances in conformity with the generalprinciple referred to above.6. It will be the general policy of the Allied and associated Governmentsthat recognised and stable local Governments in liberated areas should beencouraged to do as much as they can for themselves and local Governments willbe anxious to do so since in this way they will improve their status in the eyesof their people and will get their own administrative organisation into workingorder. In the field of relief it will be desirable that local Governments should,wherever possible, themselves organise the distribution of supplies and shouldbe allowed to play as much part as possible in negotiating contracts and makingother arrangements with suppliers. The stronger Governments possessing funds,some of which will already have extensive contracts with the supplying authoritiesbefore they are restored to their metropolitan territory, will be jealous of interference or supervision and it will be desirable that the comparing and checkingfunctions which UNRRA must perform in order to arrive at a fair distributionof supplies should be as unobtrusive as is consistent with their efficient discharge.7. UNRRA will come into operation in any liberated territory at such timeand to such extent as the military commander shall invite them to do so. or afterthe military commander has handed over his powers to a local Government, atsuch time and to such an extent as the local Government may request.B. Procedure.Allocation of supplies and shippingThe machinery for the allocation of supplies and shipping which the Governments of the United States and the British Commonwealth have built up i.-centred on the Combined Boards and the various Supply Agencies of theGovernments. The two main centres of this machinery are Washington andLondon, while local units exist for the screening and liaison purposes in variousoverseas territories, e.g., in the Middle East, South Africa, North Africa. TheCombined Boards themselves the concerned with the overall supply and shippingpicture, the allocation of sources of supply atid policy to be pursued in developingsources of supply and the co-ordination of the activities of the Governmentsrepresented on the Boards. The efficient operation of this machinery calls forthe establishment in the main centres of committees concerning themselves withthe position in the various territories, receiving and processing the importantprogrammes of the territories so that the problems requiring action by the-Combined Boards can be isolated and passed to them in the appropriate form,and that uniformity of action by the various Boards and Agencies can be secured.It is most desirable that UNRRA should be closely associated with thismachinery so as to be in a position to present the case for the supplies neededfor the territories for which it has responsibility on comparable terms to thecases piesented for other territories.Pre-invasion functions of UNRRA.The operations, both of UNRRA and the supply authorities, will be greatlyassisted if reasonably complete estimates of requirements can lie prepared beforethe actual invasion of the territories concerned. Such estimates will enable theCombined Boards to gauge the size of the problem with which they will have todeal and to adjust their programmes as far as possible to allow for the demandswhich will become actual later. In addition, advance estimates are required it&apos;action is to be taken to accumulate stockpiles or to place orders for the deliveryof supplies at future dates when they will be needed. The preparation ofestimates in a form in which action can be taken on them requires agreementupon standards of provision, the calculation from such standai-ds of basic require-ments for the various territories to be liberated and the formulation (by the useof an agreed strategic key) of overall requirements schedules divided into periodsin which delivery will be needed. During this pre-invasion period it will not bedesirable for particular supplies to be earmarked for each territory to be liberatedand the Governments of these territories should not be able to take action them-
selves to secure supplies. In formulating plans it will be necessary, therefore,for UNRRA to act for all liberated territories and to collaborate both with theUnited States and United Kingdom military and supply authorities in thepresentation of estimates of requirements and in securing by the nationalagencies the necessary procurement action wherever this is possible.Post-invasion functions of UNRRA.Once a territory has been liberated it will be necessary to decide at what timeand to what extent the territory concerned will require the assistance of UNRRAin providing and paying for the supplies and services needed from abroad. Assoon as possible authenticated programmes of actual import requirements willhave to be drawn up to supplement or replace the advance estimates alreadyprepared before invasion. To some extent these programmes may be formulatedduring the period of military control. Once representatives of UNRRA areestablished in the territory it will be essential for them to play their part, incollaboration with the local authorities and with the military or civilian officersof the liberating Powers, in the preparation of import requirements. Suchcollaboration will require the formation of some kind of joint office or program-in j tig authority in which the various interested authorities can work together andthe necessary co-ordination secured between them. The form of such an officeor programming authority will no doubt vary from country to country and willdepend in part on the ability of the local Government to formulate its owndemands, to distribute supplies and to pay for its requirements. A well-established local Government with administrative services and foreign exchangeat its disposal will be able to do most of the work itself and will only requirecomparatively small detachments from UNRRA and some representatives of theUnited States/United Kingdom supplying agencies attached to the UnitedStates/United Kingdom Diplomatic Missions to collaborate with it, andadvise on the preparation of requirements, the development of industry, &amp;c.Other Governments, with less authority or without funds, will require moreextensive assistance. In such cases representatives from UNRRA will no doubtplay the major part on the spot in drawing up and screening import requirements.Representatives of the supply agencies in this case would play a supplementaryrole. In any event, such a United States/United Kingdom/UNRRA/localGovernment screening unit will be required if a fair distribution of supplies isto be obtained and if the allocating authorities are to be satisfied that the suppliesand shipping made available at the expense of others are genuinely required andproperly used.The position and responsibility of UNRRA in respect of the requirements ofany territory will differ according to wffiether the local Government is able to payfor its imports. If the local Government cannot pay for its imports, it will haveto make application to UNRRA for its needs and the programmes of requirementswhen drawn up should go to UNRRA for action (either direct to its head office orthrough a regional office if appropriate). It is suggested that time will be savedand efficiency promoted if a copy of such programmes is sent for informationdirect to the supply authorities, who would, however, take no action as regardsallocation or procurement until authority was received from UNRRA. If, on theother hand, the local Government were able to pay for its requirements and wasnot, therefore, in a position of having to apply to UNRRA for assistance, it wouldstill be necessary for UNRRA to receive complete information about the importprogrammes and to have a right of veto over excessive demands if it is to see thatsupplies are fairly distributed between paying and non-paying countries. Thequestion arises whether in these cases the susceptibilities of the paying Govern-monts would be better met if these Governments were given direct access on theirrequirements to the United States/United Kingdom&quot;supply machinery (as thenext best thing to direct membership of the Combined Boards) or whether theywould feel better satisfied if their requirements were handled exclusively throuo-b.UNRRA, who could act as their champions (or could disapprove&apos;of tholerequirements which it thought excessive). In the view of the United KingdomGovernment the former method is more likely to achieve the political end ofsatisfying the susceptibilities of such Governments while preserving the fullauthority of UNRRA. Accordingly the United Kingdom Government wouldpropose that in the case of programmes of requirements for which the recipientGovernment intends to pay, the programmes should be sent by the local screening-authorities to the supply authorities in Washington and London (either direct orthrough the Missions of the recipient Governments in those capitals) while a copy
of such programmes should be sent to UN RE A. It would then be for the Director-General of UNRRA or his nominee to inform the United States/United Kingdomauthorities whether he approved or disapproved of the demands in the pro-grammes. It would be understood that no demands in these programmes wouldbe submitted to the allocating authorities without bis approval. At the same timethe Director-General would lie able to make such other comments as he saw fit onthe programmes which would already have been screened by his representative inthe field in the light of local circumstances. Such comments might take the formof suggesting an upward revision if this were appropriate. In this way UNRRAwould &quot;be able to make sure that the richer countries were not obtaining more thantheir fair share, while at the same time not interfering with the direct contactbetween the local Government and the supply authorities which such a Govern-ment is likely to demand.A chart is attached to this note showing in schematic form how import pro-grammes would be drawn up and routed in two typical cases, one a paying countryand the other a non-paying country.C. Distribution and Procurement.It seems desirable that recognised local authorities should undertake asmuch as possible of the business of distribution within liberated territories. Onthe one hand. Governments will wish to do this for themselves as soon as theyare able, and, on the other, it is doubtful, whether UNRRA will wish to becomeinvolved in the complexities of local rationing and with the political disputesand factions that this may entail. Experience in Europe after the last win-points to the desirability of local Governments being encouraged to undertakeas much of the responsibility as they can. At the same time, in some countriesgreat dislocation may exist or epidemics or other special conditions may makeit essential for some outside authority to come to the assistance of the localGovernment by providing technically trained personnel. In these cases UNRRA,supplemented as necessary by charitable organisations, would be the appropriateauthority. The provision of such assistance should be a matter for discussionbetween the local Government and/or the military authorities and UNRRA. Inany event it must be recognised that UNRRA representatives must be able tosupervise distribution of the supplies which UNRRA has financed and to satisfythemselves that they are being properly used.In cases where UNRRA was undertaking functions of distribution, supplies,imported from abroad might be consigned to the local representative of UNRRA.In cases where the local Government pays for supplies, consignment would hemade direct to such Government. There would no doubt be political advantagesif, in cases where UNRRA paid for the goods but did not distribute them,supplies were consigned to the local Government. If this were done UNRRAwould avoid having to deal with the business of shipping documents, generalaverage charges, and the other duties of a consignee. On the other hand.UNRRA might find that their supervision over the distribution of free supplieswas best enforced if the goods were eonsj net! to their representative. This canonly be decided in the light of local circumstances.Just as local Governments should lie encouraged to undertake their owndistribution, there would be advantages in their being given as much of thework of procurement and handling as is possible without disrupting the existingmachinery. The stronger Governments would no doubt maintain supply missionsin London and Washington (some already have them) which would be able tonegotiate with suppliers and handle the extensive paper work which is necessaryto conform with war-time procedures. The part which Governments mightplay in procurement would vary according to&apos;the commodity and the source ofsupply recommended by the allocating authority. The United States Govern-in en t has taken over all procurement for lend-lease countries and may wish todo so in respect of all large-scale purchases for liberated territories howeverfinanced. The United Kingdom and Canadian Governments also would probablynot be prepared to allow Allied Governments complete freedom to negotiatepurchases with private firms, although there are often details of specifica-tions, &amp;c, which it is convenient for the agent of the requiring Government tosettle direct with the supplying firm. Again in other cases, e.g., certain food-stuffs, where Government Agencies control directly the whole supply, it wouldbe most convenient for such Agencies to do the whole of the handling.In cases in which UNRRA was providing the finance, it. could be arranged,where necessary, that the appropriate Agency of the supplying Government
soprocured and handled the goods and were reimbursed through UNRRA from thecredit or fund opened in that country for UNRRA.Similar considerations would apply as regards shipping, since the varioussupplying Governments have established procedures for the handling and loadingof ships and for synchronising the movement of goods to cthe ports with thearrival of vessels for loading.pi Finance.Whatever arrangements are made to finance UNRRA, certain general pointswill have to be met. In the first place, UNRRA will have to have creditswherever supplies can be obtained, whether those supplies are to reach Europeor Asia from overseas or later to be carried from one European or Asiaticcountry to another. In the second place, it will probably be politically easierfor the Government of each of the contributing countries if it stipulated thatthe bulk of its appropriation of funds for UNRRA is to be spent within itsown territorial limits. But it will be desirable that the system should be givenflexibility and the degree to which each Government is successful in securingsome latitude for spending outside of its own territory the sum appropriatedwill influence UNRRA&apos;s ability to finance supplies where supplies and shippingavailability is greatest. In the third place, some countries will pay for all theirsupplies, without drawing on UNRRA, others will pay for some and others againfor none of their supplies. It will, therefore, be necessary for UNRRA toestablish machinery for deciding at an early stage in the drawing up of animport programme by a country which expects to get all or part of its suppliesas a gift, what shall or shall not be eligible to be supplied by UNRRA. Theearlier the UNRRA representatives on the local programming authority in thecountry apply for free supplies can make known to the Supply Committee of\ NRRA what is likely to be sought, the less the delay in procuring supplieswhen the programme is finally presented.ot/i October. 1943.
