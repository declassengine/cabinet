DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SECRET.MEMORANDUM ON MAN-POWER,Important issues of policy are raised by the Man-power position as set outin the following Memoranda : (i) Memorandum  by   the  Minister  of  Labour  and   National  Serviceon the Estimated Supply of Man-power in 1944 (W.P. (43) 472).(ii) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on the Man-powerrequirements of the Royal Air Force (W.P. (43) 425).(iii) Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty on the Man-powerrequirements of the Navy and Admiralty industries for 1944(W.P. (43) 448).(iv) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War on the Man-powerrequirements of the Army for 1944 (W.P. (43) 464).2. The estimates of requirements in 1944, as shown in these memoranda,are as follows : &apos;Forces Navy ............ 288,500Army ............ 345,850R.A.F............. 142,000 776,350Munitions Admiralty .......... 71,000Ministry of SupplyM.A.P............. 97,000Other requirements        ...... 6,000 174,000Other Industries and Services (e.g., coal, agriculture, transport,&amp;c.)     .......:.       ... ... 240,000Total (in round figures)      ... ... 1,190,000In addition, as was forecast at the time of the last survey, unavoidablewastage from industry now exceeds the intake from all sources; and it is estimatedthat in 1944 there would be a net decrease of 150,000 in industry as a whole, evenif there were no recruitment for the Forces.To meet present plans and programmes, therefore, the Forces and industryneed an expansion of 1,190,000. And, apart from any call-up for the ForceSj ourindustrial man-power will shrink by 150,000 in 1944. Thus, on present plans, weare faced with an overall deficit of 1,340,000.3. If we continued, regardless of the effect on industry, to operate theadministrative machinery for the call-up, we could get about 260,000 men for theForces i.e., under 40 per cent, of their demand. About 190,000 of these wouldbe the new class of 18-year-olds.But this intake into the Forces could only be secured at the expense ofthe munitions industries; since (a) industries supplying, the civil population havebeen cut to the bone, and there is no other source of supply; and (b) it is onlyin the munitions industries that there are still any substantial numbers of fit menof military age. And the munitions industries have already carried substitution(of woman for men) to such a point that the withdrawal even of these numberswould be apt to have more than a pro rata effect on output. If still largernumbers were withdrawn, the effect on output would be progressively more serious;for we should then be calling mainly on the skilled key men, whose withdrawalwould cause dislocation out of proportion to their numbers.We could get about half of the women required by the Forces; but these alsowould be obtained largely at the expense of munitions/4.   Thus, the problem is no longer one of closing a gap between supply andrequirements.   Our man-power is now fully mobilised for the war effort.   We[26333]
cannot add to the total; on the contrary, it is already dwindling. All we can dois to make within that total such changes as the strategy of the war demands.If we had to carry on the war against Germany and Japan for several moreyears, the scale of our war effort in terms of man-power would have to decreaseprogressively. This fact has not been taken into account by the Departments inestimating their requirements. We have now reached the point at which it mustbe taken into account. For the question how we should use our man-power in1944 depends on what assumption we are prepared to make about the durationof the war with Germany.5.   There seem to be two broad alternatives :  (a) We can assume, for the purposes of our man-power plans, that ourmaximum effort must be made in 1944, and that Germany will bedefeated by the end of that year. On this assumption we could (afterallowing for the munitions and men required for the war againstJapan) cut back substantially the requirements for munitions whichcould not be delivered until after 1944 and for men who could notbe trained in time to fight in 1944. We could also cut down thetraining organisations and ancillary formations which would other-wise be kept up to the strengths required if the Forces were to bemaintained at their present level after 1944. All Departmentscould be directed to concentrate on the measures necessary to bringour greatest striking power to bear in 1944. On this basis thepresent man-power demands for the Forces and munitions could besubstantially reduced.(b) Alternatively, we can say that our man-power plans must be based onthe assumption that war with Germany will continue well beyondthe end of 1944. In that event we must face the fact that ourForces and munitions industries have been built up to levels whichit is impossible for us to maintain over a prolonged period. And wemust plan now for a progressive reduction in the scale of our effort.Unless it can be assumed that this shrinking process could be appliedequally to all claimants, it would be necessary to determine on whatother principles the cut should be apportioned.6. Whichever of these alternatives is now chosen, if the war with Germanycontinues after the end of 1944 we shall have to rely increasingly on United Statesresources to make up for the declining scale of our own effort. Our choice betweenthese two alternatives will, however, determine the form which this Americanassistance must take. If we have chosen alternative (a), we shall have unbalancedour war effort and shall have to look to the United States to provide a largerproportion of the equipment for our Forces. If, on the other hand, we havechosen alternative (&amp;), the additional help from the United States will have tocome in the form of more fighting units with their equipment.7. The Departments&apos; estimates of requirements have not yet been subjectedto the usual detailed scrutiny: but it is not thought that the broad issues setout above would be materially affected by any process of paring and pruning. Itis suggested, therefore, that before work is started on a detailed scrutiny of thefigures, Ministers should decide whether our Man-power Policy for 1944 is to bebased on either of the two alternative assumptions set out in paragraph 5, or onsome different assumption.
