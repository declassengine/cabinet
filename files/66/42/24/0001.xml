The Ministers are authorised to make a public statement with regardto agricultural prices on the lines indicated in (i)-(vii) of the Appendix to.W.P. (43) 455, and to enter into discussions with representatives of theagricultural industry on this subject, it being understood that no increase in thereturns of the industry as a whole is contemplated, but only a change of emphasisbetween commodities.2. If it appears that there is a prospect of acceptance by the agriculturalindustry of a settlement of current agricultural prices, on these lines, the Ministersare authorised to announce that His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to givean assurance that the present system of fixed prices and an agreed market for theprincipal agricultural products will be continued for not less than two years afterthe conclusion of the war with Germany, in order to secure stability during alength of time sufficient for a permanent policy for agriculture to be decided uponand put into action.3. In furtherance of these objects, the Ministers are also authorised toannounce that they are arranging for representatives of the AgriculturalDepartments to start discussions with the representatives of the agriculturalindustry, as to agricultural policy, both in the transitional period, immediatelyafter the end of hostilities, and in the post-war period.[26288]
4.   The object of these discussions will be (a) To elicit the facts, as a. basis for the formulation of policy, on a numberof very complicated problems which have arisen as a result of theimpact of war conditions on the industry, and in the light of probableconditions after the war.(b) To elicit from the representatives of the various interests in the agricul-tural industry their views as to the best method of giving practicaleffect to the Government policy of maintaining after the war a healthyand well-balanced agriculture, as an essential and permanent featureof national policy.No question of committing the Government to any particular line of actionwill therefore arise at this stage.5.   Among the points to be discussed would be the following : (a) The application to the circumstances of this country of the generalprinciples of agricultural production laid down at Hot Springs.(&amp;) The methods by which guaranteed markets and prices might be seemedat whatever level the Government, in the light of general internationaleconomic and financial conditions after the war, might ultimatelydecide it was in the national interest to maintain production. Thiswill include measures to reduce the cost of agricultural products tothe consumer.(c) The contribution which home agriculture can make to securing adequatefood supplies in peace and war. without placing a disproportionateburden on the home consumer or the Exchequer.(d) The extent and methods of public control over the use and managementof agricultural land and over standards of farming to ensure efficiency.(e) Methods to ensure that the benefits  resulting from any scheme ofguaranteed prices and markets and intended by the State to accrue tothe agricultural community are, in fact, received bv that community,and not by other interests.(/) The principles which should be applied for reorganising and improvingagricultural education and advisory services for the promotion ofefficiency.(g) The principles which should govern the marketing of home agriculturalproduce including improvement of quality, grading, standardisa-tion, &amp;c. and the sale and slaughtering of livestock, and the machineryfor regulating such marketing.6. The fact that these discussions are being held may be made known, butthe course of the discussions should be kept confidential and should be purely ofan exploratory character.7. The Ministers should report progress, from time to time, to the WarCabinet, in order to ensure that the general course of the discussions is not atvariance with the development of Government policy as a whole for thetransitional and post-war periods.
