A. External Affairs.1. Discussions with the United States on Post-War Economic Matters.During September, a party of officials under the leadership ofMr. P. K. Law, M.P., left for Washington, in order to discuss informally withUnited States officials economic questions against the background of Article VIIof the Mutual Aid Agreement. These discussions are now proceeding and thefollowing paragraphs note the stages reached : (a) The Clearing Union Scheme.Exchanges of views during the quarter have helped to elucidate the mainpoints of difference; the Americans have made it clear that they lay great stresson the principle of subscription to a Eund, on the limitation of liability, and on nocountry being compelled to de-value or up-value its currency against its will. Weare, for our part, putting forward certain counter-suggestions now underdiscussion.(b) An International Investment Institution.United States proposals were received at a late stage in the discussions andwill not be considered during the present series of meetings.(c) International Regulation of Primary Products.We are ready to show our scheme to the United States.(d) Commercial Policy.The Aide-Memoire mentioned in para. 4 of the second quarterly Survey(W.P. (43) 316), together with an outline to illustrate the proposals it contained,received War Cabinet approval,* and discussions have now been initiated withthe Americans. In the discussions held so far the American response has beenconstructive and, on the whole, favourable.The Americans have said that they would also like to discuss internationalcartels, and the international co-ordination of full employment policies.2. Civil Aviation.(a) International Questions.In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet! mentioned in para. 5of the second quarterly Survey (W.P. (43) 316), this matter has been handledduring the period by the Lord Privy Seal, assisted by a Committee of Ministersnominated by the Prime Minister. These Ministers are the Secretary of Statefor Air, the Minister of War Transport, the Minister without Portfolio, theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.The Statement of General Principles (W.P. (43) 251), amended in the lightof a discussion at the War Cabinet meeting held on the 24th June.t wasdespatched to the Dominions and India on the 3rd July. Comments had beenreceived by the 5th August from all the Governments concerned except that ofthe Commonwealth of Australia, whose reply, delayed on account of the GeneralElection in that country, has not yet been received.Meanwhile, the Ministerial Committee had piit in hand the preparation ofa series of memoranda designed as briefs for the guidance of United Kingdomdelegates in readiness for inter-Commonwealth and international discussions.It has throughout been contemplated that members of the British Commonwealthshould reach general agreement among themselves before entering into discussionswith other members of the United Nations, but it was not until the 6th Septemberthat the Canadian Governments objections to the preliminary Empire talks werewithdrawn after the matter had been discussed between the Prime Minister andMr. Mackenzie King. At the same time, the Canadian Government indicatedthat, owing to a change in the basis of representation, they could not sponsor thecalling of an International Conference at Ottawa. On the 17th September, theMinisterial Committee, after considering a message from the Prime Ministerrecording the result of a conversation with President Roosevelt in Washington,arranged for invitations&quot; to be issued to the Dominion Governments and theGovernment of India for the assembly of British Commonwealth representatives(including technical advisers) to meet in London as early as possible in October.* VV.M. (43) 106th Conclusions. Minute 4.f W.M. (43) 88th Conclusions, Minute 1.
The question of the holding of an International Conference, which it is hopedto arrange not later than the beginning of November, is to be raised at theforthcoming meetings of Foreign Secretaries in Moscow, when questions ofprocedure. e.g., the scope of the Conference, the status of delegations, and the dateand place of meeting are due to be discussed (W.P. (43) 406).(b) Manufacturing questions.It was reported in para. 4 of the first quarterly Survey (W.P. (43) 127) thatauthority had been given by the War Cabinet, for work to proceed on the designof new types of aircraft for transport purposes and on the conversion of existingmilitary types. Design and prototype construction work for four of the five newtypes of aircraft recommended by the Brabazon Committee has now been placed.The fifth is under consideration.The four selected firms were told that they wotdd get an order for twoprototypes each, and were instructed to submit outline tender designs within theframework of the short description of each aircraft given in the report of the FirstBrabazon Committee.   Two of the firms have now submitted such designs.A Second Brabazon Committee was set up in May by the Secretary of Statefor Air to define in greater detail users&apos; requirements for post-war civil aircraft.The aim is to bring together the requirements of customers (e.g., the businesscommunity) and potential operators, both in this country and overseas, so that theaircraft shall satisfy the largest possible market. The Committee presented anInterim Report on the 5th August containing inter alia a list of requirements forthe largest of the five types.In addition. Handley-Page are proceeding with the design and prototypeconstruction of the transport version of the Halifax in accordance with anotherof the Brabazon Committees recommendations. As regards the transport versionof the Lancaster (The York) and the large flying-boat (The Shetland), bothrecommended by the Brabazon Committee for post-war civil needs, the York isalready in production and the Shetland is due to come into production in 1945 onscales designed to deal with war needs only.3. International Relief and Rehabilitaton.The report of the Inter-Allied Committee was formally adopted on the30th June, 1943, and submitted to the Allied Governments. It surveys the wholefield of the Committee&apos;s work, sets out a minimum imports programme for the firstsix months&apos; period after liberation for the Allied countries concerned and includesdetailed reports by Allied Committees on agriculture, medical supplies andservices, nutrition and inland transport.The Allied Governments have been recommended, in a letter from the ForeignOffice, to agree to the submission of the report to the United Nations Relief andRehabilitation Administration.A revised draft of the Agreement establishing a United Nations Relief andRehabilitation Administration has been chculated by the United States Govern-ment to the United Nations and nations associated with them in the war. with aninvitation to sign the Agreement on or about the 9th November and to take partin the first meeting of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administra-tion Council which is to be held immediately afterwards. Instructions for theBritish delegation to this meeting are being prepared.In connection with estimates of requirements, a Working Group, led by theRelief Department and including representatives of Departments concerned, isexamining the Young Working Parties&apos; estimates of the relief requirements ofAllied and enemy territories. The purpose of this examination is to arrive at anagreed view on these estimates among the Departments concerned in preparationfor discussion with the Americans.The Group has agreed that it is desirable that the Young Estimates shouldbe sent on to the Combined Boards unaltered, if possible, but accompanied bysuch comments as are appropriate. A covering memorandum on these lines, andmemoranda on the estimated requirements for medical supplies, food and clothinghave been prepared to serve as briefs for British representatives in discussionwith the Americans. The Group is now engaged on the examination of therequirements for other commodities.The Group has also had under consideration the question of departmentalresponsibility for sponsoring orders for supplies to be furnished, to countriesrequiring relief, for the period after the initial period of liberation (for which
the War Office will take responsibility). It has been agreed that formal respon-sibility for such orders should be taken by the Relief Department, which wouldapproach the Treasury for the necessary sanction and then make the officialrequest for procurement to the appropriate Supply Department.The President of the Board of&apos; Trade has asked the Civilian Goods (Supplies)Committee to consider what possibility there is of finding some capacity for reliefproduction of manufactured goods in the United Kingdom. The Committee havealready agreed that a small surplus of agricultural machinery, which appears tobe in view over other requirements, should be earmarked for relief. It has alsoagreed to recommend that no further labour should be withdrawn from thewoollen industry and that any surplus of piece-goods which may thus becomeavailable over Service and other requirements shall be held for various contingentneeds, including relief.4. The Military Sub-Committee and. the Post-Hostilities PlanningSub-Committee.The Military Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Problems Committeewas, during the period under review, replaced by the Post-Hostilities PlanningSub-Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.The duties of the Post-Hostilities Planning Sub-Committee are in the mainto represent the joint Service viewpoint in regard to post-hostilities strategicquestions of military interest, and to act as a channel through which the ServiceDepartments can exchange views on post-hostilities problems with the ForeignOffice and other Departments of State. The Sub-Committee normally reports tothe Chiefs of Staff Committee or the Ministerial Committee on Armistices andCivil Administration.The Post-Hostilities Planning Sub-Committee is also responsible foradvising the Reconstruction Problems Committee on any military questionsarising in the course of its work, with a view to ensuring that those militaryconsiderations Avhich will affect policy when hostilities cease receive dueconsideration in its deliberations.During the first part of the period under review the Military Sub-Committeewas chiefly engaged in the elaboration of armistice or surrender instruments andin preparing for the organisation of a Control Commission for Italy.Those questions have been pursued by the Post-Hostilities Planning Sub-Committee since its appointment as well as other questions with which theMilitary Sub-Committee had also dealt initially, such as surrender instrumentsfor Germany and the Balkan States, the military occupation of Germany and thestrategic aspects of various other problems affecting the post-war situation inthe Balkans and the Mediterranean basin. The Sub-Committee is also arrangingfor a closer association with the Dominion representatives as regards those partsof its work which are likely to be of interest to the Dominions.5. Interdepartmental Committee on Reparation and Economic Security.The Interdepartmental Committee on Reparation and Economic Security hasnow submitted its Report to the Ministers who were responsible for setting upthe Committee.B. Machinery of Government.6. Central.The activities recorded in previous Surveys continue. Departmentalconsideration of the recommendations of the Committee on Scientific Staff isalmost completed and the report should very soon be ready for submission to theChancellor of the Exchequer. Certain interim measures have been taken toimprove conditions of service and prospects of advancement without prejudiceto the long-term proposals of the Committee.7. Local Government.Following a discussion by the Reconstruction Problems Committee ofsuggestions for the setting up of a Royal Commission on Local Government, aMemorandum on Local Government Reform (R.P. (43) 26) was submitted to that
Committee by the Minister of Health. The Committee agreecP that the Ministershould be authorised to approach local government circles on the proposalsaffecting county reviews and valuation at a suitable time in the autumn, a.deputation from the two chief Associations of Local Authorities was receivedby the Minister of Health and the Minister without Portfolio in August. Afterconsideration by the Committee on Reconstruction Priorities!, a reply has beensent to the Associations indicating the Governments decision not to institute anenquiry now.The Official Committee on Post-War Internal Economic Problems has beenasked to collate the various proposals affecting local government now in con temp la-tion by Departments, and to report on their collective effect on the functions andfinances of the different types of local authority and their bearing on the futureof local government generally.8. Review of War Legislation.A Committee on Emergency Legislation was appointed in accordance withthe decision of the Lord Presidents Committee of the 4th June! as a Sub-Committee of the Legislation Committee. This Sub-Committee is reviewing thefield of war legislation and has the following terms of reference : &quot; (a) To review the whole field of war legislation, including the DefenceRegulations and other subordinate legislation, and to consider whichparts of this legislation could be dispensed with immediately afterthe cessation of hostilities (i) in Europe, and (ii) in other theatres ofwar; which parts could be dispensed with at various stages in theperiod of transition from war to peace; and which parts should hecontinued, with or without modification, until it can be decided bythe Government of the day whether they should be embodied iiipermanent legislation.(b) To consider what legislative authority will be needed for the exerciseof the emergency powers required during the transitional periodbeginning with the cessation of hostilities in Europe; and, inparticular, whether that authority could be secured, at any rate in theinitial stages, by so adapting the Emergency Powers (Defence) Actsand other war-time Acts that they would be appropriate to theconditions obtaining in the period immediately following the end ofthe war.&quot;C. Finance.9. Savings.A Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Kinclersley to consider theform of the National Savings Campaign after the war was set up on the10th August and has held two meetings.D. Defence.10. Admiralty Committee on Post-War Problems.In July the Board of Admiralty set up an Admiralty Committee on Post-WarProblems under the Chairmanship of Captain Pilkington, M.P., the Civil Lord,with the following terms of reference : To consider the important problems which will face the Admiralty inpassing from a state of war to a state of peace with Axis countries, and tomake recommendations to the Board on the action to be taken.The Committee has proceeded to work on the assumption that the enemywould be defeated in three stages, i.e., the defeat of Italy, the defeat of Germanyand the defeat of Japan, and is considering the problems which may arise at eachstage. The Committee is only concerned with the problems of the transition ofthe Navy and its ancillary services from a war-time to a peace-time state, andnot with any reorganisation of the Naval Service which may be required at eachstage for the prosecution of the war.* E P. (48) 8th Meeting, Minute 1.t P.K. (43) 20th Conclusions, Minute 1.t L.P. (43) 37th Conclusions, Minute 4.
Stage 1-the defeat of Italy has already been reached. The necessarychanges, however, are mostly minor adjustments which are within the scope ofthe existing Admiralty departments, whilst such matters as armistice terms,terms of occupation, strategic questions and disarmament have come within thescope of the Military Sub-Committee and its successor (see para. 4 above)Questions coming under Stage 2 are now being dealt with by the Committee,and it is hoped that rapid progress will be made. Investigation is also proceedinginto matters arising at Stage 3. Admiralty consideration of post-war mineclearance, too, has made considerable progress and proposals are being formulatedSome of these problems, such as that concerning the disposal of surplus storesand of war factories, are matters for joint consideration with other Departmentsand the necessary contacts with the other interested departmental authorities andinterdepartmental committees are being established.E. Industry.11. Industrial Reconstruction.(a) Approach to Industries.The Board of Trade and the other interested Departments have now almostcompleted the first stage of their approach to industries. Where several Depart-ments are interested in an industry they are collaborating in the approach. TheBoard of Trade have covered almost all the textile and consumer goods industries,some 95 per cent, of the civilian engineering industry, retail trade associationsand the film industry. The Ministry of Aircraft Production have approachedthe aircraft and light metals industries and the Admiralty and the Ministry ofWar Transport the shipbuilding and shipping industries. The Ministry ofSupply and the Ministry.of Works have approached respectively almost all theraw material industries and building materials industries for which they areinitiating the approach. A large number of replies have come in, and Depart-ments are now meeting the industries and taking up the points which arise fromthe discussions. The Ministry of Food have made a preliminary and limitedapproach to the food and drink industries.(b) Production Departments Sub-Committee of the Official Committee on Post-War Internal Economic Problems.This Sub-Committee has now submitted its interim report on the disposalof surplus stocks of raw materials, manufactured goods and machinery, factoriesand storage premises (W.P. (43) 437, also R.P. (43) 29). Its recommendations,which include proposals for setting up machinery for handling these disposals, havebeen generally approved by Ministers.* Arrangements for dealing with currentsurplus stocks have been made for some industries, which should form a basis forpost-war disposal arrangements, and are being discussed for others. Considera-tion has also been given, on the one hand, to the possibility of making a provisionaland tentative forecast of the post-war position of individual Government-ownedmunition factories and, on the other, to the demand for such factories fromcivilian industry and to the relative need in different areas for continuing pro-duction in them. The Departments concerned are proceeding with theirconsideration of the problem of the termination of war contracts.(c) Location of Industry.See note on Post-War Employment, paragraph 15.(d) Export Trade.In the course of the Debate in the House of Commons on the 27th July onthe Votes of the Department of Overseas Trade, the Export Credits GuaranteeDepartment and the Board of Trade, Mr, Harcourt Johnstone stated that arrange-ments were now in train for the production by the Department of Overseas Tradeof reports indicating : (1) in general terms the post-war prospects for UnitedKingdom goods in particular markets overseas, (2) the methods of trading withthose markets, and (3) the conditions which particular export industries arehkely to find in the more important markets. The preparation of these reportsis now proceeding.* R.P. (43) 9tli Meeting, Minute 1.
12. Agriculture.The Agricultural Ministers for Great Britain have submitted to the WarCabinet a further memorandum on post-war agricultural policy (W.P. (43) 422),prepared in the light of the conclusions of the War Cabinet of the 15th April last*and the recommendations of the Hot Springs Conference. The memorandumseeks authority for entering into discussions with the agricultural industry aboutthe general principles on which post-war policy should be based, with a view toreporting back to the War Cabinet the results of the discussions.Following consideration of the Luxmoore Committee&apos;s Report on Agricul-tural Education, proposals for the future of technical agricultural education havebeen agreed in principle with the Board of Education&apos;. These and also proposalsfor a National Advisory Service are now before the Treasury.13. Forestry.The Forestry Commission&apos;s Report on Post-War Policy (Cmd. 6447) wasdebated in the House of Commons on the 6th July and in the House of Lords onthe 29th July. In his reply in the Commons the Minister without Portfolio statedthat the Forestry Commission were authorised to take all steps that are now opento them to prepare for a great expansion of their efforts. In the Lords the debateranged chiefly round the constitutional status of the Forestry Commission, variousviews being expressed. This question is before the Machinery of GovernmentCommittee. In the Commons three Motions have been put down. Cue(50 Members) calls for a Bill to implement the Forestry Commission proposals, asecond (12 Members) asks for postponement pending a decision on agriculturalpolicy, and the third (7 Members) asks for better Welsh representation in forestrvadministration.In August the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the late Sir Kingslev Wood) andthe Minister without Portfolio accompanied the Chairman of the Forestry Corn-mission on a week&apos;s tour of Forestry properties in Scotland and the BorderCountry. The Forestry Commissioners are conferring with representatives of theland-owning and Forestry Societies on the future of private forestrv and willreport in clue course. The discussions, of which two have been held, are not vetconcluded.F. Labour.14. Demobilisation and Resettlement.(a) Demobilisation.At their meeting on the 4th August, 1943.t the War Cabinet appointed aMinisterial Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Minister withoutPortfolio, to carry out a general survey of our demobilisation plans on the basisof a two-stage ending of the war. The problem of Service demobilisation hadbeen surveyed in two Reports (attached to W.P. (42) 498). dated the 22nd May.1941. and the 9th October, 1942. respectively, by the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on the Machinery of Demobilisation. The more general aspects ofthe Demobilisation and Resettlement of Labour were dealt with in a report bythe Official Committee on Post-War Internal Economic Problems, dated the16th October, 1942 (W.P. (42) 498). All three Reports were considered by theWar Cabinet on the 19th November, 1942.1 who recorded their general agreementwith the conclusions in the Reports as a basis for further preparatory work.The Reports, however, were framed on the assumption of a war ending atabout the same date: the Ministerial Committee appointed by the War Cabinethas the task of considering the complications that would ensue from a two-stageending of the war, and it is also examining the claim which has been pressed inParliament and elsewhere that service overseas should be given special considera-tion in arranging the order of demobilisation.(b) Post-War Training and Entry into the Biiilding Industry.The Minister of Works has submitted two memoranda on the Post-WarBuilding Programme to the Committee on Reconstruction Priorities.  Thesememoranda showed the estimated volume of work and the labour demands of the* VV.M. (43) 55th Conclusions, Minute 1.f W.M. (43) tilth Conclusions, Minute 2..   i W.M.

Building Programme for the first two years after the war, and suggested apossible allocation of the labour force as between maintenance and war damageon the one hand and new works on the other. Reference was made to the controlsnecessary to regulate the position in the immediate post-war period, and certainsuggestions were put forward for more stringent control of maintenance work.The various proposals will be further examined departmentally. Furtherinformation is being obtained for the Demobilisation Committee (see para. 14 (a)above) with a view to securing more precise assessment of building labour likelyto be released through demobilisation.The Committee on Post-War Training of adults for the building industry-has now been constituted and will shortly be considering the detailed arrange-ments for the training course.The General. Purposes Committee of the Building Apprenticeship andTraining Council has approved preliminary reports from its Sub-Committees on&quot;-Review of apprenticeship schemes,&quot; &quot; Means of acquiring information fromthe industry,&quot; &quot; Prospects of obtaining apprenticeships for boys taking full-timebuilding courses at technical schools,&quot; &quot; The training and supply of teachers andinstructors for building courses &quot; and &quot;Industrial requirements.&quot;(c) Reinstatement of Ex Service personnel in civilian employment.Proposals for amending the law in regard to reinstatement and for extendingreinstatement rights to volunteers in the armed forces and equivalent women&apos;sservices were approved by the Lord Presidents Committee on the17th September.*Draft legislation is now well advanced and will be submitted to theLegislation Committee at,an early date. In accordance with the decision of theLord Presidents Committee a memorandum has been circulated to the JointConsultative Committee of the National Joint Advisory Council for discussionearly in October.(d) Resettlement Advisory Service.The Lord Presidents Committeet have approved the proposals put forwardby the Minister of Labour and National Service (L.P. (43) 203) for providing aservice to give general advice on resettlement questions to persons demobilisedfrom the forces and from war industries. Resettlement and Welfare Bureauxare to be established for this purpose in a number of principal centres and specialsections set up in each main Employment Exchange and Appointments Office.Further consideration is being given to the suggestion that a semi-public Trustshould be created to follow up special cases of ex-Servicemen who may get intodifficulties and need special assistance and resettlement.(e) Rehabilitation and Resettlement of Disabled Persons.A draft of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations made by the TomlinsonCommittee for the post-war Scheme for securing employment, under ordinary andsheltered conditions, for disabled persons including provisions for theirindustrial rehabilitation and vocational training has been prepared and wasagreed in principle by the Lord Presidents Committee on the 29th September.\The general principles of the scheme have been discussed with representatives ofthe British Employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades Union Congress GeneralCouncil, and a substantial measure of agreement has been secured. It is proposedin the near future to consider the matter further and in greater detail with thosetwo bodies.The Interdepartmental Committee which is co-ordinating the action of thevarious Departments on the recommendations of&quot; the Tomlinson Report iscontinuing its work and presented an Interim Report to the Minister of Labourand National Sen dee on the 17th July, 1943.(f) Committee on Higher Appointments.The Committee on Higher Appointments under Lord Hankey (see para. 15 (c)of the second Quarterly Survey (W.P. (43) 316)) has been set up and itsconstitution was announced on the 14th July.* L.P. (43) 57th Conclusions, Minute 1.f L.P. (43) 57th Conclusions, Minute 2.i L.P. (43) 59th Conclusions, Minute 1.
-(g) Oversea Settlement on Demobilisation.The Dominion Governments have not yet communicated any decisions on thesuggestions made to them in despatches of April 1943. It is known that tbevhave given some attention to the question, but, in the case of those Dominionswhere General Elections have recently taken place, full, consideration hasnecessarily had to be postponed until after the Elections.(h) Women&apos;&apos;s Services.As a result of the Markham Report on Welfare in the Women&apos;s Services, theWar Cabinet agreed on the 20th January, 1943,* that an InterdepartmentalCommittee should be appointed to consider the future of these Services. Theterms of reference subsequently given by the Deputy Prime Minister were :  (a) To consider the future of the three Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and tomake recommendations.(b) To enquire into the possibilities of utilising for post-war reconstructionin Europe (whether in units or individually) the personnel of thoseServices and women employed whole-time in Civil Defence; and toreport whether any preparatory action to this end is called for.In its Report, published on the 11th June, 1943, on (a) the Committeerecognised that the three Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services would be needed up tothe time of general demobilisation, and recommended that the Departmentsconcerned should prepare for members of these Services to accompany forces ofoccupation as soon as conditions permitted. After general demobilisation it wasimportant that a nucleus should be maintained for each Service in order to allowrapid and efficient mobilisation in the event of another war. The form andmagnitude of these peacetime organisations would vary widely between the threeServices, and the details must be worked out individually by the Departmentsresponsible when plans are in preparation for the maintenance of the armedforces as a whole.On (b) it was agreed that members of the Auxiliary and Civil DefenceServices should he able in their individual capacities to volunteer for admini-strative posts under the Civil Affairs Officer during the period of military control.Members of these Services, when they can be spared from their Service duties,should also be given full opportunity to volunteer for appointments under theUnited Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the voluntarysocieties working in conjunction with it. The Committee further recommendedthat if organised units of the Civil Defence Services are to be sent to Europethey should include women.On the 22nd July, in reply to a question, the Prime Minister made a briefstatement on these recommendations to the House of Commons (O.R. the22nd July. 1943. Col. 1072).15. Post-War Employment.On the 13th July the Reconstruction Priorities Committee directed that anintensive study should be made by the Departments chiefly concerned of the mainproblems hearing on post-war employment policy under the following heads :  (a) Location of Industry.(b) Mobility of labour and structural employment.(c) Control and timing of public investment.(d) Control and timing of private investment.(e) Regulation of consumption.(/) Restrictive practices  (by employers and  workers)  in  industry andcommerce.The Committee decided at the same time that this work as a whole should bedirected by a Steering Committee on the official plane whose functions would be(a) to map out the field of enquiry and to assign the various parts to the Depart-ments primarily concerned; (b) to keep in touch with the progress of the workand to receive the reports of the Departments as the various studies arecompleted; and (c) to bring together the results of all these enquiries into a singlecomprehensive Report which they would submit to the Reconstruction PrioritiesCommittee. This work is actively proceeding.* W.M. (43) 12th Conclusions, Minute 5.
G. Social Services.16. The Beveridge Plan.Further progress has been made with the various sections of the Plan. Inparticular, the Committee on Reconstruction Priorities have considered papers,on children&apos;s allowances, provision for widows, and death benefit, and havereached provisional conclusions on some of the major points. It was stated inpara. 17 of the second quarterly Survey (W.P. (43) 316) that the Home Secretaryhad been asked to arrange for the examination of an alternative scheme ofworkmen&apos;s compensation and to submit a detailed plan for consideration by theCommittee on Reconstruction Priorities. This examination has been carried out,and proposals for a new scheme were submitted to the Committee on the13th September (P.R. (43) 59). Papers have also been submitted on theassimilation of contribution conditions for unemployment and disability benefitand the question of excluding the first thirteen weeks of disability from Class IIbenefits.The Minister without Portfolio has announced in the House of Commons*that it is hoped to issue a White Paper within the next few months showing theprogress made on the major problems, and, in respect of some matters, settingout considerations on which further consultations and the development of aninformed public opinion will be desirable before conclusions can be reached.17. A Comprehensive Health Service.In the previous Surveys the three proposed stages of a general programme&apos;for the preparation of this service were indicated as being :  (1) preliminary and confidential discussions with groups representing themedical profession, the major local authorities and the voluntaryhospitals, without commitment on either side;(2) preparation and publication of a general statement of the issues involvedin organising the service, probably in the form of a White Paper,serving as an appreciation of the whole subject and as a focus foropen public discussion;(3) lastly, the stage of settling the contents of draft legislation.During the three months under review stage (1) has been concluded. Thepreliminary discussions have come to an end, and the various representativegroups have been given to understand that the next step is the publication of theWhite Paper under stage (2).

(43) 310,para. 24) is arising in connexion with immediate needs and, as is publiclyknown, steps are being taken by the Ministry of Labour and National Serviceand the Ministry of Fuel and Power jointly to recruit additional man-powerto the industry.A Recruitment and Training Branch has been set up within the Ministryof Fuel and Povver. in recognition of the fact that the maintenance of adequateman-power m the coal industry is likely, both on the short term and on thelong term, to be one of the most intractable problems of that industry. TheBranch is at present mainly engaged, in collaboration with the Ministryof Labour and National Service, on the early establishment of a number oftraining centres in the coalfields for the preliminary training of the additionalman-power now being recruited on a short-term basis. It will also lie responsiblefor the effective operation by employers of the provisional schemes initiated lastyear for the training at the mines of all new entrants, including juveniles.

Consideration is being given to a transitionalscheme, of limited duration, for controlling shipping on an international basisin the immediate post-war period while military and relief requirements continueat a high level. The method of re-establishing our long-term shipping interestswill largely depend upon the policy of the United States regarding her merchantfleet-built for war purposes.Consideration is also being given to the extent to which some measure ofcontrol of merchant shipbuilding may be necessary in the post-war period.27. Water Supply.The Bill to consolidate and modernise the water supply code, as a necessarypreliminary to any major measures, has passed all its stages in the House of Lordsand awaits Second Reading in the House of Commons.The extension of piped supplies in rural areas (together with the relatedquestion of sewerage) has, as agreed by the Lord Presidents Committee.t beentaken up with the Treasury.
