(43) 472.22nd October, 1943.WAR CABINETcMAN POWER.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1. BY the end of this year the mobilisation of the nation will be practicallyomplete. The total intake from all sources in 1944 will not be sufficient to replaceordinary wastage and there would be a deficit of 150.000, even if no one werecalled up for the Services.2. The Services are requiring an additional intake for 1944 of 776,000 menand women. The Supply Departments are asking for a net increase in munitionsof 174,000, while the basic industries of the country (coal agriculture, transport,&amp;c.) are demanding a net increase of 240,000.3. These demands cannot be met. The standards and amenities of thecivil population cannot be further reduced, and it is considered that no more than75,000 men and women can be obtained from the &quot; less essential &quot; industriesduring 1944. If 55.000 of these 75.000 are transferred to the basic industries, thenatural decrease in these industries will be made good and the labour force willbe stationary. This leaves 20,000 to offset the natural decrease in munitions of120.000. Accordingly even if no one is called up for the Forces a decrease inthe labour force in munitions in 1944 is an inevitable fact which we must face.The question for decision is the extent of the decrease.4. The number likely to become available for the Forces in 1944 underpresent arrangements is about 300.000 (260.000 men and 40.000 women). Toprovide a greater number would involve the withdrawal of large numbers ofskilled and key men and drastic steps would be necessary. If 300.000 men andwomen were withdrawn, the munitions industries would decrease by 400,000,including the natural decrease of 100.000.5. Whatever the overall decrease in munitions may be, there still remainsthe question of its incidence on the three Supply Departments. If the labourforce of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Aircraft Production is to be main-tained or increased, this can only be done at the expense of the Ministry ofSupply, which must in that case bear the whole of the munitions decrease.6. The situation in 1944 as disclosed above presents us with a new problemwhich cannot be solved by proportionate cuts in the demands of the Service andSupply Departments, but requires a fresh review of the uses to which the avail-able man power is to be put. As a preliminary to any decision it is necessary tohave in mind some approximate date up to which the maximum provision mustbe made for the Forces. It is also necessary to know the extent to which eachof the three Services is likely to be engaged in battle and the extent to which theproduction of munitions can be sacrificed for the supply of men to the Forces.7. A more detailed statement of the estimated Supply of ,Man Power inrelation to the demands for the Forces and Industry for 1944 is circulatedherewith (Appendix 1). together with the Annual Man Power Survey(Appendix 2). E  B &apos;Ministry of Labour and National Service,22nd October. 1943.I 261961
APPENDIX 1.Estimated Supply of Man-Power for 1944.1. The total intake into industry from all sources in 1944 will he insufficientto replace ordinary wastage. It is estimated that even if there were norecruitment from industry for the Forces, the number of men and women inindustry would decline in 1944 by at least 150,000. If there were no transferenceof workpeople from&quot;one industry to another the changes in industry groups !.(&apos;)II(&quot;) and III(a) would be approximately as follows :  Increase (-f)Decrease (-).Group I (Munitions)      ...........        - 120,000Group II (Other essential industries) ...       ...       -   55,000Group III (Less essential industries) ...       ...       -t-   25,000Total ............       - 150,0002. The view of the Departments that are mainly concerned with productionand services derived from Group III industries (Ministry of Works, Board ofTrade, Ministry of Food and Ministry of Supply) is, in effect, that the labour forceof that Group, taken as a whole, should not be allowed to fall below the level ofDecember 1943 by more than 50.000 after allowing for the increases required incertain industries referred to below. Any decrease beyond that point wouldseriously reduce the standards and amenities of the civil population.3. In the normal way, as shown above, the labour force in Group ill mightbe expected to increase during 1944 by about 25,000. This is because t be largestindustries in the group are scattered over the whole country and will attract alarge proportion of the new intake of labour, which will be almost entirelyimmobile. If the Group III industries can be allowed to fall by 50,000 net itfollows that they can supply in 1944, for employment in the other two Groups, atotal of 75,000. This would reduce the net deficit: in the latter, due only to naturaldecrease, to 100,000.4. The intakes required by the Forces in 1944 have been estimated by theService Departments as follows :  Woman.Wotnen&apos;s    Wonien&apos;s TotalAuxiliary     Nursing - .. Men awlService. Men. Services.     Services.      Total. Women.Royal Naw        ......      247,000 40,000 1,500 41,500 288,500Army        &apos;......       ...      319,000 24,000 2,000 20,000 345.000Roval Air force ...       ...       119,000 22,750 250 23,000 142.000Total      ......      085.000 80,750 4,050 01,400 770,4005. In round figures the Forces intake and the net increases required incertain industries, as put forward by the Supply and other Departments, may besummarised as follows :  Forces Intake ...............      776,000Industry net increases Group I (Munitions)    ............ 174,000(&apos;)Group II (Other essential industries)         ... 240,000Group.III (&quot;Less-essential&quot; industries) (in-eluding 10,000 for relief services)...... 50,000Grand Total      .........    1,240,000The 50,000 required in Group III has been taken into account in arriving atthe possible net decrease of 50,000 in that Group referred to above.(&apos;) Munitions. Metal manufacture, engineering, aircraft, other vehicles, metal goods andinstruments manufacture and repair, shipbuilding and repairing, chemicals, explosives, oils, &amp;c.(-) Other Essential Industries. Agriculture; mining; National and Local GovernmentServices (excluding Civil Defence); gas, water and electricity supply; transport, communicationand fishing; food, drink and tobacco manufacture.(3) &quot;Less Essential&quot; Industries. Manufactures: Textiles, leather, clothing, wood, paper,printing, bricks, pottery, glass and miscellaneous manufactures (other than those in (&apos;) and (&apos;)above). Building and Civil Engineering. Distributive trades. Other Services: Commerce,banking, insurance and finance; professional services; entertainments; hotels, restaurants:laundries and cleaning.(M The 97,000 for .M.A.1&apos;. included in this figure covers only the first half of the year.
6. The Group II requirements are spread over every important industryand service in the group, except Local Government Service. Substantial numbersare required for coalmining and gas, petroleum, agriculture, National Govern-ment (mainly industrial staffs for Service Departments), transport and foodmanufacture. It is obvious that no appreciable part of these requirements canbe met by transference from other parts of the group. To achieve a net increaseof 240,000 in the group as a whole the natural decrease of 55,000 must also bemade good, and accordingly there must be a transference from other groups of notless than 295,000. Even if Group II had first call on the 75,000 likely to beavailable from Group III it would still leave a deficiency of 220,000 in Group II,which could only be met by transference from munitions. Such a transferencewould increase the deficiency in Group I to 340,000.7. If the increases demanded for Group II were not approved and the labourforce of the Group were merely maintained during 1944 at the level of the31st December. 1943, this could be achieved by the transference from Group IIIof 55,000 out of the 75,000 available from that Group. This would leave a balancefrom Group III of 20,000 available for transfer to munitions.8. It is estimated that at the end of this year the total labour force inGroup I (Munitions) will be approximately 5.300,000. In the long run this musthe the ultimate source of supply for the Forces.9. The increase of 174,000 required in Group I as shown in paragraph 4includes the following requirements :  Admiralty       ....      ...............      71,000M.A.P......................      97,000(5)Railway workshops     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        6,000It is obvious that these increases could only be supplied by sufficiently largecuts in the munitions industries on work for Ministry of Supply, other Depart-ments, home market and export trade.10. If the increases asked for in the Group II industries coalmining,gas, petroleum, agriculture, National Government Service, transport and foodmanufacture -are to be supplied, these must also come from the munitionsindustries by means of cuts additional to those required to meet the demands ofAdmiralty, MAP. and Ministry of War Transport.11. It is estimated that by the end of 1943 the numbers in the munitionsindustries working for the three Supply Departments, other Departments andthe home and export trade will be approximately as follows :  Admiralty ...M.A.P..........Ministry of SupplyOther DepartmentsHome and Export...Unallocated (mainly Iron and Steel) .Total        ..........      5,330,00012. The intake for the Forces and the increases required in the munitionsindustries amount to a total of 950,000. If the increases demanded in Group IIare not approved, the deficiency in Group I is 100,000 and, when added to theGroup I demands and the intake required for the Forces, this makes a total tobe found from the rest of Group I of 1,050,000. If the increases in Group IIare also to be achieved, this total becomes 1,290,000. The only field from whichany part of this number can be provided is the 2,632,000 employed at the end of1943 on work for Ministry of Supply, home market and export, &amp;c.925,0001,773,0001,491,000309,000421,000411.0002,632,000Up to the 30th June,.1044.b 2

The movements between industries will be more complex than that shownabove. In practice the intake for the Forces will come in the first place fromGroups II and III as well as Group I, but on the foregoing assumptions thewithdrawals from Groups IT and III must be replaced from Group I, and inthe long run any Forces intake must result in a corresponding reduction of themunitions labour force. Accordingly, for simplicity it has been shown above ascoining directly from Group I.12th October, 1943.APPENDIX 2.MAN-POWER MID-1939 TO MID-1943.Survey by the Ministry of Labour and National Service.Summary   ...I.

Summary.Distribution of the Population.1. At mid-1943, out of over 33 million persons of working age (14-64)over million (15 million men and 7f million women) were engaged in someform of employment or service (para. 3).2.   Over 2f million persons 500.000 men and over 2-  million women_inthe &quot; non-industrial &quot; section of the population before the war are now engagedin some form of employment or service (para. 7).3. During the last year (ended the 30th June, 1943) net recruitment of womenfrom the non-industrial section amounted to 433.000, as compared with 790 000in 1941-42 (para, 6).4. At mid-1943, 7,900.000 men (aged 14-04) and 2,520.000 women (aged14-59) were in the Forces, Civil Defence and munitions; 4.030.000 men and1.610.000 women in other essential industries (Group II); and 3,120,000 men and3.230.000 women in other industries (Group III) (para. 10 and Tables 1 to 3),Comparison bet-ween 1943 and 1918.5. Mobilisation of man-power had gone much further towards the end ofthe fourth year of this war than it. had by the end of the fourth year of the lastwar, 32-7 per cent, of the population at mid-1943 being in the Forces. CivilDefence and munitions compared with 27-8 per cent, in 1918. 17-7 per cent, inother essential industries compared with 15-3 per cent, and 49-6 per cent, inother industries and the non-industrial section of the population compared with56-9 per cent, in 1918 (para. 11).Industry.6. There has been a decrease of the total labour force in industry betweenmid-1939 and mid-1943 of 1.906.000, a decrease of 3.590.000 men being partlyoffset by an increase of 1.684,000 women (paras. 23 and 24).7. There has been an increase in munitions between mid-1939 and mid-1943of 592,000 (21-4 per cent.) men and 1.453,000 (273-1 per cent.) women, makinga total increase of 2,045,000 (61-9 per cent.) (para. 23 and tables 1 to 3).8. For the year ended the 30th dune. 1943, munitions increased by 58.000(1-8 per cent.) men and 265.000 (15-4 per cent.) women, making a total of 323.000(6-4 per cent.) (para. 26).9. Group II industries decreased during the 4 yeai-s mid-1939 to mid-1943by 262,000 (4-4 per cent.), an increase of 722.000 (81-3 per cent.) Avomen beingoffset by a decrease of 984.000 (19-6 per cent.) men; between mid-1942 andmid-1943 the net change was insignificant, a decrease of 101,000 men beingoffset by an increase of 103,000 women (paras. 40, 41 and 42).10. In munitions and Group II industries together, there has been anincrease of 2,175,000 women (paras. 23 and 24).11. Agriculture increased during the year mid-1942 to mid-1943 bv 4.000men and 34,000 women (para. 43).12. Civil establishments of Government Departments increased during theyear by 84,000, men by 27,000 and women by 57,000. In the four years mid-1939to mici-1943 Government Departments have expanded by 88,000 men and 353,000women (para. 43).13. Group III industries decreased between mid-1939 and mid-1943 by3,689,000, made up of 3.198,000 men and 491,000 women; this represents a lossof nearly 37 per cent, of their total labour force over 50 per cent, of their men,and over 13 per cent, of their women (para. 51).14. Group III industries decreased between mid-1942 and mid-1943 by588.000 (8-5 per cent.), made up of 482,000 (13-4 per cent.) men and 100.000(3-2 per cent.) women (para. 52).
fit Men of Military Age.15. At mid-1943 there were approximately 2,600,000 fit men of military age(171 and under 43) in civilian employment. This total included 350,000 menwho were either available for enlistment or had been released from the Forcesfor industry (para. 100).16. The remaining 2,249,830 were reserved or deferred, and represent thefield for consideration in connection with the supply of additional men for theForces. The total of 2,249,830 included 771,660 who were below 30-1 years of ageand 1,478,170 who were 30-  and over (para. 100).17. Of the 771,660 young (i.e., 17 -30 ) fit men, 51,950 were in Group IIIindustries, 329,270 in Group II industries and Civil Defence, and 390,440 inmunitions (para. 102).18. Of the 1,478,170 older fit men of military age (30^ and under 43), 254,500were in Group III industries, 692,280 in Group II industries and Civil Defenceand 531,390 in munitions (para. 103).Women.19. At mid-1943 there were 15,989,000 women aged 14-59; of these8,672,000 were in the age classes 18-40. Of the 8,672,000 aged 18-40, about3.277,000 were single, 1,680,000 were married without children under 14 livingwith them, and 3,715,000 were married with young children (para. 105).20. At mid-1943 there were 7,355,000 women aged 14-59 in the Forces,industry and Civil Defence; of these 4,762,000 were aged 18-40 (para. 105).21. Among women 18-40, 90 per cent, of the single women, 80-6 per cent,of the married women and widows without young children, and 12-3 per cent, ofthe married women and widows with young children were in the Forces, industryand Civil Defence. Among women aged 41 and under 60 no less than 33 per cent,of those aged 41-50, and over 20 per cent, of those aged 51 and under 60 weresimilarly employed, counting two part-time workers as one (para. 106).22. Single women are a high proportion of the total aged 18-59 in Group IIand in Group III &quot;Other Services &quot; (para. 109).

The following Table gives an approximate age analysis of the population(14-64 men and 14-59 women)(&apos;) in Great Britain at mid-1939, mid-1941, mid-1942 and mid-1943 :-Date.Mux. 14-6-1 Mid-1980Mid-1941Mid-1942Mid-1948Women, 14-59-M id-1939Mid-1941Mid-1942Mid-1943Total Mid-1939Mid-1941Mid-1942Mid-1943hi-17.1,5191,4271,3881,3621,5101,4151,3801,3503,0292,8422,7082,712(Thousands)1S-30.1,1881,195.1,1-121,0971,1881,200 &apos;1,1421,0952,3712,3952,28-12,19221-40.7,3007,3277,3007 2727,5807,5007,5457,57714,89014,82714,84514,84941-64/59.5,9-136,0110,0780,1505,8.17-   5,9055,9495,9071 1.70o11,91612.02712,123Total.16,01015,96015,90815,88710,04016,02016,010.15,98982,05031,98031,92431,8762.    Since the outbreak of war the following changes have occurred :  (1) The number of boys aged 14-17 has fallen by 157,000, and the numberof girls by 160,000. These decreases are clue to the fall in the birthrate between 1921 and 1929, which is having an important bearingon the supply of young man-power for the Armed Forces, Women&apos;sAuxiliary Services, and for industry. Its effect is already seen inthe reduced numbers reaching military age and the age when labourbecomes fully mobile.(2) There are decreases also in the numbers aged 18-40. The number ofmen has dropped by 179,000, partly due to war casualties, and thenumber of women by 41.000.(3) The number of men aged 41-64 has increased by 213,000, and the numberof women aged 41-59 by 150,000. Attention has frequently beendirected in recent years to the increasing numbers in the higher agegroups of the population. This is leading to an increased&quot; rate ofwastage among the working population through invalidity and thehigher death rate.(4) The total population of the ages shown above has fallen by 174,000: thenumber of men has decreased by 123,000 and the number of womenby 51.000.3.II. Population aged 14-64.The estimated population of working age (14-64 inclusive) of GreatBritain at mid-1943 was about 33.126.000, including 15,887,000 men and17.239.000 women. The total number aged 14-64 in paid employment was about22^.800,000, including 15,050,000 men and 7,750,000 women, of whom about 700,000are in part-time employment. In addition there were about 1,000,000 men andwomen aged 65 and over in paid employment, and at least 1,000,000 women ofall ages rendering voluntary unpaid service mostly on a part-time basis.(&apos;) The figures for mid-1911, mid-1042 and mid-1943 are estimates made in the Ministry ofLabour and National Service. They may be subject to a margin of error, but this is not likely tobe large enough to invalidate the conclusions drawn from the estimates. The figures exclude nunfrom the Forces who are prisoners of war and those returned as &quot; missinc&quot;

The distribution of the population (men aged 14-64 and women 14-59)among the Forces, full-time Civil Defence, Industry, and the remainder of thepopulation (hereinafter termed &quot;non-industrial&quot;) at the four dates was asfollows : \i-i nod Forces Men    ...WomenTotalfull-time Civil Defence-Men    ...     ....WomenTotalMid-1939.4774778080(Thousands.)Mid-1941.

The net increase in the number of men in the Forces was almost as greatin 1942-43 as in 1941-42.The figures for women show a slightly lower rate of increase in the second ofthe two years.The increases in the number of men in the Forces are reflected in thedecreases in the number in industry 572,000 in 1941-42 and 525,000 in 1942-43.The. total number in industry declined in 1942-43 by 263,000 as comparedwith a negligible decrease in 1941-42. This was due not only to the continued heavywithdrawal of men for the Forces, but to the fact that the number of womenincreased by only 262.000 as compared with 567,000 in the previous year. Thenet recruitment of women from the non-industrial section of the population isdeclining rapidly. It amounted to 433,000 in 1942^L3 as compared with 796.000in 1941-42.[26196] c
7. The table in para. 4 shows that since the beginning of the war there hasbeen a net increase of about 2,600,000 391,000 men and 2,215,000 women-%%industry, the Forces and, full-time Civil Defence. The total numbers recruitedduring the war from outside the field of industry and the Services have beenconsiderably greater than these figures. A large number of women have beenunable to remain in industry. At mid-1943, out of nearly 32 million persons ofworking age, over 22,400,000 (15,052,000 men and 7,354,000 women) were&apos; engagedin some form of employment or service for the country.8. The great bulk of the men recruited to the Armed Forces have beenwithdrawn from industry. Nearly half the reduction of 3,590.000 men in industryhas been made good by an increase of 1,684,000 women. This increase, togetherwith an increase of 461,000 women in the Auxiliary Services and 70,000 in fulltime Civil Defence has been made possible by the mobilisation of large numbersfrom the non-industrial section of the population. The decrease by mid-1943 inthis section amounted to 2,215,000. There has been a corresponding reductionamong men of 514,000. of which 391,000 accounts for a net increase in thenumber of men in the Forces, full-time Civil Defence and industry. This increasehas been achieved in spite of the fall of 123,000 in the total number of menaged 14-64.9. There is naturally a wastage from the population of working age due todeath, invalidity, retirement from employment upon marriage or child-bearingamong women, and the attainment of the upper age point. Wastage from thesecauses is made good by the flow into industry of boys and girls upon leavingschool. The reductions in the numbers in the non-industrial section of thepopulation referred to above have occurred over and above this normal movement,10.

Comparison between 1943 and 1918.11.

At mid-1943, 32-7 per cent, of the population was occupied in the FightingServices, full-time Civil Defence and the munitions industries, as compared with27-S per cent, in 1918. The proportion in industry Group II is also larqer(17-7 per cent, as compared with 15-3 per cent.) owing to the greater numbersin National and Local Government. The numbers in industry Group III and, thenon-industrial population represented 49-0 per cent, of the total at mid-1943 ascompared with 56-9 per cent- in 19IS.12. Differences in the character of the two wars affect detailed comparison,particularly as between men and women. Greater mechanisation of the AimedForces and the larger programmes of factory building, airfield and campconstruction and repair of air-raid damage have made it necessary to retain agreater proportion of men in industry. Consequently, the Fighting Services andfull-time Civil Defence included a smaller proportion of the male population atmid-1943 than in 1918. On the other hand, women have been brought directlyinto the war effort to a far greater extent. These points are brought out in thefollowing Tables for men and women separately :  Men 14-64.

If casualties in both wars were included in the figures,the differences between the figures for 1943 and 1918 would be increased. On theother hand, the number of men in the munitions industries is now. nearly 60 percent, greater than it was in 1918 and represents 21-1 per cent, of the male popula-tion of working age as compared with 15-7 per cent, in 1918. The FightingServices, full-time Civil Defence and the munitions industries now include7,900,000 men, or 49-7 per cent., as compared with 6,720,000, or 49-8 per cent., in1918. The number of men retained in Industry Group II is about 710,000 greaternow than it was in 1918. These industries include 25-4 per cent, of the adultmale population as compared with 24-6 in 1918.14. In the case of women, 25-8 per cent, of those aged 14^59 are now inthe Fighting Services, full-time Civil Defence and the munitions and Group IIindustries, as compared .with 13-5 per cent, in 1918. The proportion in theFighting Services and the munitions industries is more than double the proportionin 1918 (15-7 per cent, as compared with 7 per cent.) and this increase representsabout 1,510,000 women.

These tables show that there has been a decrease of the total labour forcein industry between mid-1939 and mid-1943 of 1,906,000, a decrease of 3,590,000men being partly offset by an increase of 1,684,000 women. They also show thatin Group I and Group II together there has been an increase of 2,175,000 women.25. Over half the man-power for the Forces has been recruited fromIndustry Group III. While in certain of these industries a large proportion ofthe men thus withdrawn have been replaced by women, there has been, at thesame time, a very substantial transference of women from Group III to theWomen&apos;s Auxiliary Services and the munitions industries. The net effect on theindustrial distribution of women is shown by the fact that although the totalnumber in industry has increased since mid-1939 by 1,684,000 the proportion inGroup III has dropped from 72-4 to 47-3 per cent, (the number in Group III hasfallen by 491,000).Changes mid-1942 to mid-1943.26.Men 14-64 and Women 14^-59.These are shown in the following TableIndustry Group.Group I (Munitions)Group IIGroup IIIAll industriesNumbers atMid-1942.

27. The total labour force in industry thus declined between mid-1942 andmid-1943 by 263,000; a decrease of 525,000 men was partly offset by an increaseof 262.000 women. In spite of this the munitions industries increased by 323,000made up of 58,000 men and 265.000 women. In Group II a decrease of 101,000men was offset by an increase of 103,000 women. In Group III there was a totaldecrease of 588,000 made up of 482,000 men and 106.000 women.28. The increase of 262,000 women in industry is the result of an increaseof 354,000 married women and widows partly offset by a decrease of 92,000 singlewomen. This decrease has arisen through recruitment of single women for theWomen&apos;s Auxiliary Services.Group I (Munitions).Changes m?V/-1939 to m.vV-1943.(7)29. At mid-1943 there were approximately 3,361,000 men aged 14-64 and1,985,000 women aged 14-59 in this group, making a total of 5,346,000. Thegroup included, at mid-1943, 30-9 per cent, of the total labour force in industryas compared with 17-2 per cent, at micl-1939.

Of the total increase of 2,045,000 between mid-1939 and. mid-1943nearly half (985,000) occurred in the two years to mid-1941. The increase of737,000 in the year 1941-42, when mobilisation under the Registration forEmployment Order was most active, was not much less, but the approachingexhaustion of man-power resources brought the increase in 1942-43 down to323.000.32.

S9. The increase in the number of women since 1939 is accounted for entirelyby commerce, banking, insurance and finance and professional services. In theformer a substantial withdrawal of men since mid-1939, equivalent to about60 per cent, of the total male labour force, has been partly counter-balanced bythe intake of women. In 1942-43 there was a slight reduction in the number ofwomen. In professional services the increase in the number of women is accountedfor largely by the intake of women into hospital service. This intakecontinued up to June 1943. There have been substantial reductions among bothmen and women in the other services included in the group entertainments,hotels, public-houses, restaurants, &amp;c, laundries and cleaning.90.

It is estimated that the group included about 60,000 men aged I7f andunder 43 who were medically fit for service with the Forces. This is 2-4 percent, of the total number of fit men of those ages in all industries, and 13-0 percent, of the total number of men aged 14-64 in the group.94.

Numbers of Fit Men of Military Age in Civil Employment.99. Table 6 shows the estimated numbers of fit men of military age invarious industry groups at mid-1943. Table 6a shows the numbers reservedand deferred after taking out the men available for enlistment in the Forcesunder existing arrangements.100. Table 6 shows that at mid-1943 there were approximately 2,600,000fit men of military age (171 anc^ under 43) in civilian employment [of whomabout 110,000 were in Civil Defence Services). This total included 350,000men who were either available for enlistment or had been released from the Forcesfor industry. The remaining 2,249.830 -were reserved or had their enlistmentdeferred, and they represent the field for consideration in connection xvith thesupply of additional men for the Forces. The total of 2,249.830 included 771,660who were below 30-g years of age and 1,478.170 aged 30-1 yefws and over.101.   An industrial and age analysis of the 2,249,830 fit men aged 17-f andunder 43 who were reserved or had their enlistment deferred is given in Table 6a.The figures for two broad age groups in the main industries are as follows : Men aged       Men aged 30i   Total&apos; aged 17fIndustry group. 17J-80J.        and under 43.    and under 43.Group I (Munitions) ......      390,440 531,390 921,830Group II Agriculture        ......... 132,150             153,300             285,450Mining     ............. 136,190             149,990             286,180National and Local GovernmentService and Civil Defence ... 30,620 187,430 218,050Transport;    Gas,    Water    andElectricity;  Food and Drink 30,310             201,560             231,870Total Group II        ...      329,270 692.280 1,021,550Group III Building and Civil Engineering 11,440 51,640 63,080Distribution       ..:       ...... 8,270 67,280 75,550Manufactures     ......... 19,760 97,120 116,880Professions and other services ... 12.480 38,460 50,940Total Group III       ...        51,950 254,500 306,450Grand Total ...      771,660 1,478,170 2,249,830
102. Of the 771,660 young men no less than 658,780 or nearly 90 per cent,are in munitions, agriculture, and mining and 60,930 or nearly 8 per cent, arein the remaining Group II industries and services. The Group HI industriesinclude only 51,950 of these men of -whom over one-third are in manufacturingindustries.103. Of the older men (30^ and under 43) who member in all 1,478,170834,680 or nearly 60 per cent, are in munitions, agriculture and mining. \further 388,990 or over 26 per cent, are in the remaining Group II industries,254,500 or 16-J- per cent, are in Group III industries.104. The total number of (it men of military age in Group III is thus 306.450or less than one-seventh of the total in all industries. These men consist almostentirely of key men. In the manufacturing industries they are mostly employedin the maintenance of machinery or as skilled production workers on whoseservices the employment of large numbers of unskilled and semi-skilled workersdepends. In the distributive trades the reserved and deferred men are alsokey men such as managers, butchers, &amp;c. In the professions and other servicesgroup the great bulk of the 50,940 men are in professions (doctors, dentists, &amp;c);the number in entertainments, hotels, laundries and cleaning is insignificant.IX. Women.105.   At mid-1943 there were 15,989,000 women aged 14-59 inBritain, of whom 461,000 were in the Forces and 6,894,000 in industry and CivilDefence.The following table gives an approximate age analysis of these totals,distinguishing separately single women, and married women and widows with-out children under 14 living with them and married women and widows withvoun  children : 14-1718-4041-5051-59Women aged 74-59, mid-1943.Forces,industry andCivil Defence956,0002,950,000457,000206,000Non-industrial.Six gle.389,000327,000127,000264,000Total4,108,0001,107,000Total.1,345.0003,277,000584,000470,0005,676,000Percentage inForces,industry andCivil Defence.71 190 078-243-880-14-1718-4041-5051-59TotalMarried a.vd Widowed without Children under 14.3,000 3,0001,354,000               326,000 1,680,000464,000             1,114,000 1,578.000298,000             1,609,000 1,907,0002,116,0003,052,0005,1(58,00080-629-415-641-014-1718-4041-5051-59TotalMarried and Widowed with Children under 14.2,000 2,000458,000             3,257,000 3,715,000193,000             1,011,000 1,204,00019,000               205,000 224,000670,0004,475,0005,145,00012-316-08-513014-1718-4041-5051-59TotalTotal Married,956,0004,762,0001,114,000523,000Widowed and Single.7,355,000394,0003,910,0002,252,0002,078,0008,634,0001,350,0008,672,0003,366.0002,601,00015,989,00070-054-933 020-140-0[Note: The foregoing analysis may be subject to an appreciable margin of error,particularly as regards married women with and without children, owing to the lack of recentinformation in regard to some of the details.]
106. At mid-1943, among women aged 18-40, 90 per cent, of the singlewomen, 80-6 per cent, of the married women and widows without youngchildren and 12-3 per cent, of those with young children were in the Forces,industry and Civil Defence. Among women over 40 no less than 33 per cent, ofthose aged 41-50 and over 20 per cent, of those aged 51-59 were similarlyemployed, counting two part-time workers as a unit.107. The following Table shows the increases between mid-1942 and mid-1943 in the numbers of single women and of married women and widows in theForces, industry and Civil Defence : Age                                                   Single Married women           Total.Group. women. and widows. increase.14-17 ...       ......... 4- 4,000 .... +    4,00018-40 ............ 4-18,000 4-129,000 4-147,00041-50 ............ 4-19,000 4-153,000 4-172,00051-59 ............. 4-17,000 -t- 68,000 4- 85,000133Total 14-59     ...       4-58,000 4-350,000 -h 408,000The increase in the number of married women and widows is due partly to directrecruitment of such women from home duties and partly to the retention ofwomen in industry after marriage.108.
