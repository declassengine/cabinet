tht^j20CUME:NT IS THE PROPERtW OF&quot;HIS miT^If^^MA^Il^..S-&apos;GOVBRmE3y!T.20 thOctoberA-iJJij^COPY NO,WAR    CABINETSTORAGE IN PORT ARSA3.Memorandum by Minister- of War Transport.1.     Since the war began my Department, with the assistance of theother Departments concerned (principally the Ministries of Pood andSupply)p has placed an embargo on the use of transit sheds for storagepurposes,,     These shedsp situated on the quaysides9 are designed for theassembly of cargoes awaiting shipment or for the sorting and despatch ofimports, and unless goods move froely in and outp the port becomescongested, delays to ships and to inland transport increase and areprogressively more difficult to overcome,,2o     There is a great deal of warehouse and storage accommodation inthe immediate vicinity of the principal ports, particularly London,Liverpool and Glasgow,,     Generally it is under commercial management,which is anxious to see the capacity used to the full, but since theheavy raids in 19UO//-J.1 , try Department, with the Supply Departments andthe Control of Factory and Storage premises of the Board of Trade, hasregulated its use in order to -(c)avoid long-term storage,prohibit or restrict the storage ofhighly inflammable goods, andpreserve a margin of vacant accommodation so thatif inland transport were interrupted in an emergency,goods could be discharged through the transit sheds tobe stored in the vacant margin until communicationswere restored,.3o     Notwithstanding the efforts of the Storage Control, there isincreasing pressure on storage accommodation inland, and in consequenceI have recently been presented with an urgent request from theMinister of Pood for a substantial inorease in storage accommodation in Jport areas for commodities now afloat.     Unless his request is granted,ships will be held up for discharge, and I have very reluctantly agreedthat the available margins in port area warehouses shall be reduced,and that transit sheds not likely to be required for the discharge ofships may be used for storage.      I have made it a condition that theseshall be purely temporary measures, and that both types of accommodationso made available shall be cleared by the middle of December, 192+3*^     I understand that I may be asked to agree to considerable stocksIX Qf timber being held in port areas.5*    V/ith the increasing volume of American Army imports 9 with thestrain on port labsux% and with the deterioration in working conditionsinevitable in winter we are facing a very difficult period from, thepoint of view of transport.     The risk of an interruption of the smooth0 ?arance Qf goods by rail is a real one and it is essential to preservea buffer 0f storage space in the ports to ensure that port working isaot held up.In my view it is, therefore, imperative that urgent arrangementsnould be made to increase the storage capacity inland to accommodate

imports now coming in and to free the margin of portsstorage accommodation which I have agreed temporarily toforego.      I understand that the Board of Trade are takingurgent steps, in consultation with the main usingDepartments, to secure the greatest possible economy in theuse of storage space inland by the clearance from coveredto open storage of goods which would not rapidly deteriorateand in other ways,      I have suggested that the furtherstocking of wholesalers5  retailers and possibly ultimateconsumers, should also be considered,      I will myself tajfceup with the Ministry of Works the repair of bomb damage %owarehouse property in the port areas where this is possiblewithout undue expenditure of materials and labours.7e    Meanwhile, I ask my colleagues to take note of thetemporary arrangements I have agreed with the Minister of F00&amp;9L.Ministry of &apos;.7ar Transport.20th October, jggJT
