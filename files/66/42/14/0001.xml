The manpower needed for the Army during 1943 to complete the build up foroffensive operations on the basis of the directive by the Minister of Defence(W.P. (42) 504) was assessed at 551,000 men and women. The allocation approvedwas 171,000, making a cut of 380,000 from the demand.2. A revised demand which took account of certain internal economies and thereduction of the estimated overall wastage to 15,000 per month was submitted inApril, 1943 (W.P. (43) 272). This asked for an additional 184,000 men and womenbeyond the approved allocation. This was considered the minimum requirement with-out changing the basis laid down in W.P. (42) 504.3. The revised demand was cut (War Cabinet 102nd (43) meeting, conclusion 13)by 102,000, attention being drawn to the fact that actual wastage averaged 12,700 permonth and not 15,000. As a result of this cut it was necessary to obtain immediateapproval for the following reductions:  (a) The removal of one division from the Expeditionary Force.(b) The dispersal of one division and three brigades of the Field Army in theUnited Kingdom not included in the Expeditionary Force.(c) The dispersal of one draft-finding division.Economies are also being made in certain administrative units.4. It is estimated that these steps would have enabled the Army to complete thebuild up of the Expeditionary Force by the late spring of 1944, and to meet our othercommitments, provided that wastage during 1944 did not exceed the figure of 12,700per month taken for 1943. The very small intakes remaining due. from August toDecember, 1943 (amounting to only 21,000) would not, however, have provided sufficienttrained men during the early months of 1944 to meet wastage, and it would still benecessary to draw in some measure on the Home Field Army divisions not included inthe Expeditionary Force to bridge the gap.5. It is not possible, however, to accept an overall figure of 12,700 per month forwastage during 1944. That portion (6,700) relating to normal wastage is unlikely tochange appreciably and can be accepted, but the position in regard to battle casualtiesis quite different.The figure of 6,000 accepted for 1943 was based on the average figures for theNorth African campaign between October, 1942 and May, 1943. In this period therewas no strongly opposed amphibious operation, nor were there operations in more thanone major theatre. During 1944 we expect to undertake major operations both inItaly and in Western Europe, and these will be in some measure concurrent. Therewill also be subsidiary operations in South-East Asia which will overlap the othersduring the early months of the year, and which, for the latter part of the year, willrequire reinforcements to be despatched from the United Kingdom some mouths beforethey start owing to the length of the voyage. Moreover, these operations envisagelandings on strongly defended beaches, which is a costly type of operation.6. It has been estimated that the total battle casualties during 1944 will amount to250,000 men, sub-divided:  (a) January to June   ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      155,000(b) July to December ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        95,000J hese will require to be replaced by fully trained men before the end of the year.
J. The Army will also require an intake during the second half of 1944 to coverestimated wastage during the first six months of 1945 when this intake becomes trained.The element for battle casualties is difficult to assess accurately so far ahead, but theprovisional estimate for the total numbers required is 118,000, divided:  (a) Against normal wastage, six months at 6,700    ...       ...       ...      40,000(b) Against battle wastage,  assessed on the best information atpresent available   ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       -..      78,0008. The gross wastage to be met is therefore:  Taking place in 1944 normal, twelve months at 6,700 (paragraph 5) ...       ...       ...      80,000battle casualties (paragraph 6)     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...     250,000Taking place in first six months of 1945 (paragraph 7) normal ........................      40,000battle casualties       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      78,000Total gross wastage     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...     448,0009. In addition to the requirements for meeting wastage, there is a further capitalrequirement for the Expeditionary Force, which cannot be provided from the presentstrength of the Army, nor from the very small output of men becoming trained in thefirst six months of 1944.This requirement consists of certain engineer and labour units, primarily requiredfor airfield construction for the Tactical Air Force. These personnel, however, donot require full military training, nor are they required before operations start. Thenumbers amount to 13,000 tradesmen and 26,000 labour, and may be required at anytime from January, 1944 onwards. If the requirement of tradesmen could be metwith fully qualified men the total number could be accepted in four monthly quotasbeginning January, in order to avoid dislocation resulting from calling them all uptogether. These quotas of tradesmen would be additional to the normal minimummonthly intake of 4,000 tradesmen needed to maintain the Army in skilled men. If,however, fully qualified tradesmen are not likely to be available the whole 13,000 wouldbe needed in January to allow the maximum possible time for trade training in theArmy.   The 26,000 labour could be absorbed complete as and when required.to. The basis taken in arriving at the Army demand for men in 1944 has beenthe latest figures for the actual strength and for intakes now approved to the end of1943. Credit is thus taken for the amount by which wastage to date has been belowestimates. Full account has also been taken of the measures of economy which havebeen or are being carried out.The gross requirement in men for 1944 requiring full training (military or trade)is calculated at:  (a) To meet the deficit at 31st December, 1943      ...       ...       ...      21,000\b) To meet wastage (paragraph 8)   ...............     448,000(c) To meet the special requirement of tradesmen (paragraph 9) ...       13,000482,000Less intakes July to December, 1943, becoming trained      46,000in 1944.Gross requirement (men)       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...     436,00011. Against the gross demand for men requiring full training can be taken anoffset in respect of wounded men returning to duty.   The estimate of numbers is:  (a) From January to June, 1944        ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       18,000(b) From July to December, 1944     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      77,000(c) From January to June, 1945 (these offset the intakes required      48,000from July to December, 1944).Total offset       ...      ...      ...      ...      ... ... ... 143,00012. The net requirement is therefore:  (a) 436,000 (paragraph 10) less 143,000 (paragraph 11) ... ... 293,000(6) Special intake for unskilled labour (paragraph 9) ... ... 26,000Net requirement in military personnel (men) ... ... 319,000
13- The net requirement given above may be capable of further reduction inrespect of: -(a) A new cut in Anti-Aircraft Command, now under investigation by the Chiefsof Staff, from which it should be possible to obtain at least 20,000 for theField Army.(b) Return of prisoners of war from Italy.   It was originally hoped that we mighthave obtained, fit in due course to return to duty, up to 30,000. In thepresent circumstances this is out of the question, and the most which wemight expect is a few thousands.Neither of these possible assets is likely to be available, allowing for the necessaryperiod for training or retraining, until March or April, 1944. A corresponding reductionin the demand will be made to the extent that these assets actually become available.14. It must be emphasized that the heavy casualties anticipated during the first sixmonths of 1944 cannot be met from the very small numbers becoming trained from theintakes during the latter half of 1943. The gap, which may amount to 150,000, must bebridged by:  (a) Drawing on the remaining six Field Army divisions in the United Kingdomnot earmarked for the Expeditionary Force.(b) By some measure of cannibalization of field formations overseas.It is estimated that the Home Field Army will by the end of June, 1944, havebeen reduced completely to cadres. This is a paper calculation, but in practice theposition will be worse in that appreciable numbers of men wilt not be available fordrafting (on account of age or medical category). The burden will have to be borneby units in the field falling below establishment. It is essential, therefore, that theintakes during the first half of 1944 should be adequate not only to cover wastage duringthe second half of the year, but also to replace in the Home Field Army the men takento meet wastage during the first six months of the year, unless it is accepted that itneed not be reconstituted.15. Other Categories of Personnel.(a) Civilian personnel for the War Department required during 1944 amount to50,000. Of this number 33,500 are industrials and are required for two main purposes;first, to complete the essential expansion of Ordnance and Workshop establishmentsin the United Kingdom which will be undertaking the major portion of the Basemaintenance for the forces engaged in Western Europe; secondly, for Depots for theU.S. forces.Of the remaining 16,500 civilians, 9,000 are required for Civil Affairs staffs: these,though they will be for the most part uniformed personnel employed in the administra-tion of occupied territories, in control commissions, etc., will, under a ruling ofSir John Anderson as Lord President, count against the allocation of civilian man-power to the War Office.(6) In view of the decision not to allow any further expansion of women&apos;s servicesthe demand for 1944 for the A.T.S. is restricted to that required to prevent the forcefrom shrinking.   The number needed is 24,000.(c) The number of Nursing Officers required during 1944 is 1,693. Of these 1,045are needed to complete hospitals for the Expeditionary Force and the requirements forIndia for operations in South-East Asia. The balance is for wastage. The greaterpart of the demand is required during the early part of the year to meet dates forprojected operations.(d) To maintain the strength of Voluntary Aid Detachments, the total required in1944 is 1,200, of whom 900 are nursing and 300 non-nursing members. This require-ment is additional to that for Nursing Officers and A.T.S.16. Summary of Requirements.The Army demands for 1944 are summarized as follows:  (a) A total intake of men (exclusive of a special quota of 26,000 for labour) is293,000 to be provided as follows:  Case A Case B13,000 extra 13,000 extratradesmen tradesmenprovided fully provided asqualified unskilled menin Jan.(i) January to March    ......      124,000      ......      127,000(ii) April to June.........   -    99,000      .,.       ...        96,000(hi) July to December    ......        70,000      ......        70,000This demand will be reduced to the extent that further reductions areachieved in Anti-Aircraft Command or that prisoners of war fit to go backto duty are returned from Italy.
(b) A special intake at an indeterminate date from January, 1944 onwards, of menfor labour not needing full military training, of 26,000.(c) An intake of 50,000 civilians sub-divided into:  (i) 16,500 clericals(ii) 33,500 industrialsthe bulk of the latter being required during the first six months.(d) An intake of 24,000 women for the A.T.S. at a steady rate of 2,000 per month.(e) An intake of 1,693 Nursing Officers required as follows:  (i) January to April       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      1,245(ii) May to August...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 324(hi) September to December       ...       ...       ...       ... 124(/) An intake of 1,200 women for Voluntar\/ Air Detachments at a steady rate of100 per month.P.
