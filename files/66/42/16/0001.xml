DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.U N EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Report by the Lord President.THE Lord President&apos;s Committee have considered a memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (L.P. (43) 201) proposing certain changesin the benefits, contributions and remuneration limit for unemployment insurance.The principal features of these proposals may be summarised as follows : :(i) An increase of benefit rates of about 20 per cent, for persons of 18 orover and a substantially higher percentage increase for personsaged 17.(ii) An increase from 26 to 30 weeks in the &apos;; standard period.&quot; of benefitunder the general scheme.(iii) An additional contribution under the general scheme of Id. a week (foreach of the three parties) in respect of persons aged 18 and upwardsand \d. in respect of persons aged 16 and 17: and an increase of Id.a week per person in contributions under the Agricultural scheme.(iv) The raising of the remuneration limit for non-manual workers from 420 per annum to  520&apos;per annum.2. In view of the changes which have been made in the balance of our pro-duction programmes, there is bound to be some increase in localised unemploy-ment especially in areas where immobile workers released during the contractionof one branch of war production cannot readily be reabsorbed in other employ-ment. At a later stage, there will also be a substantial, though probablytemporary, increase in the general volume of unemployment, at the beginning ofthe demobilisation period after the war. The experience of the last war showedthe importance of preparing for this situation in advance; and the LordPresidents Committee are, therefore, satisfied that it will not be possible to post-pone until after the war changes in the rates of benefit and contribution under theunemployment insurance scheme.3. The introduction at the present time of changes on the lines of thosesuggested by the Minister of Labour and National Service would, however, lead todemands for immediate improvements in our other social services. In particular,it would be difficult, if not impossible, to withhold substantial improvements inthe existing national health insurance scheme (including cash and medicalprovision for dependants) and increases in the rate of Old Age Pension.4. There are also more serious objections of a political nature to theimmediate introduction of the substantial changes in unemployment insurance.In the first place, they would, in certain respects, be likely to prejudice theconsideration of the proposals relating to unemployment insurance in thecomprehensive scheme of social insurance. Nor would it be easy, at a time of lowgeneral unemployment and before the Government have formulated their policyfor maintaining a high level of employment after the war, to justify changesinvolving increased contributions. Moreover, there would be serious misgivingsabout the Governments intentions regarding the comprehensive scheme, ifproposals such as those put forward by the Minister of Labour and NationalService were put before Parliament before the Government had presented thepromised White Paper setting out their provisional proposals for thecomprehensive scheme.[26269]SECRET.W.P. (43) 466.19th October, 1943.
19th October, 1943.5. In these circumstances, the Lord Presidents Committee recommend thatsubstantial changes, such as those under consideration, should not be introducedbefore the presentation to Parliament of the White Paper setting out the Govern-menCs provisional proposals for a comprehensive scheme of social insurance.Every effort should, however, be made to press forward with the preparation ofthe White Paper; and, when the views of Parliament have been obtained as aresult of the Debate on the White Paper, the Government should then decidewhether certain parts of the new scheme ought to be brought into force Beforethe end of the war; or, alternatively, whether changes in one or more of theseparate existing schemes should be made as an emergency measure to deal withthe conditions likely to arise before the introduction of the comprehensive scheme.In either event the rate of unemployment benefit should at that stage be raisedto the level decided upon for the Beveridge Scheme, and the period of unemploy-ment benefit should be made the same as it will be under the Beveridge legislation.C. R. A.
