THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET Copy&apos;No,W.P. (43) 465.20th October, 1943.WAR CABINET.RECONSTRUCTION PLANS.Memorandum by the Paymaster-General.BEFORE discussing the need for decisions on reconstruction plans we mustset out what questions need to be decided. To a certain extent, it is true, allproblems are interrelated. Neverthless, they must be divided into categories anddealt with separately. Otherwise we should have to work out a complete planfor our post-war Utopia, and the only decision needed would be whether to takeit or leave it.2. It seems that the problems confronting us fall roughly into five groups.Obviously there are borderline cases between the groups, but the exact allocationdoes not in general affect the broad issue.Group I.3. The first group concerns questions arising during the transition fromwar to peace. Everyone will agree that these must be decided. Amongstthem are :-(a) Demobilisation :   rules governing the order in which men are to comehome; to what extent conscription will remain; how the home-comingsoldiers are to be found jobs; what benefits, unemployed pay, sickpay, &amp;c, are to be given to them.(b) Whether or for how long the essential work order is to be maintained;.and the power of directing labour.(c) What will be the priorities. e.g., what distribution of effort is desirablebetween making consumers&apos; goods and goods for export, or betweenbuilding new houses and repairs?(d) To what extent will the Government control production either directlyor by allocating capacity, raw materials, &amp;c.; how will Governmentfactories and stores be handled %(e) Does the Government intend to maintain stable prices for necessities&apos;?(/) To what extent will the Government continue to control the importprogramme ?(g) In planning our imports what is the relative importance of conservingforeign exchange as against shipping ?(h) To what degree and for how long must we maintain rationing of food,clothing, &amp;c. ?(i) What special provisions are necessary for  the rebuilding of areasdemolished by bombs and other building that must take place in thetransitional period? This may involve decisions about the control ofthe use of land (Uthwatt, Scott and Barlow).4. Obviously all these questions must be collated and settled before the warends and nobody would hesitate to take decisions about them, even though someof them, e.g., rebuilding bombed areas, impinge on longer-term projects.[26266]
-)Group II.5. This group concerns industries which have enjoyed abnormal conditionsduring the war. Obviously labour in some of them, such as the aircraft industry,which will have to dwindle to one-tenth very quickly after the war, will be inmuch the same state as demobilised soldiers and will have to lie dealt with in asimilar way.   But there are also our great staple industries, for example :  (a) Agriculture has enjoyed abnormal prosperity at the expense of the public.Until we can see the burdens and benefits of all the various projects asa whole it would seem improper, before a general election, to makepermanent commitments to continue this position. In addition agreat deal depends on our foreign exchange position, and on theoutcome of international negotiations, eg., will import quotas hepermissible? A transitional guarantee for one or two years, whilefull plans are worked out. is surely the most we can promise.(b) Coal-mining has contracted in the war and our exports of coal havealmost vanished. There seems little danger of a slump in demand forthe first year or twro until Germany, Poland, &amp;c., resume exporting.Since a permanent settlement raises the highly controversial issue ofnationalisation a transitional guarantee seems all that is possible.(c) Shipping and ship-building.  We shall end the war with far less shippingthan we had in 1939 unless America makes a supremely generousgesture. Since we shall not easily be able to pay foreigners to carryour necessary imports, it seems likely that we shall have to maintainship-building at the highest possible pitch for a good many years andkeep the ships we possess fully occupied. If it would give reassurance,we might give a short-term guarantee here also.Group III.6. The third group of problems concerns measures of social betterment whichwe all desire, but which are not directly connected with the war. If they are notcontroversial there is no reason for refusing to decide them unless they are goingto cost a great deal. The Exchequers resources will, of course, be limited(although perhaps not as much as some imagine), so that it seems improper tointroduce measures piecemeal which will prejudice the adoption of others Avhichmay have greater claims. It would seem that these should be worked out andthe facts and figures established so far as possible so that the main questionscan be considered together presumably forming the basis of the 4-year planreferred to in the Prime Ministers broadcast. (The long-term solutions foragriculture, coal. &amp;c. in the second and fourth groups would be handled in thesame way.) Whether it will be possible for the parties to agree on such a planremains to be seen. On a good many points no doubt they will. If the areas ofdivergence are too great, each party can go to the country on a programme havinga certain number of points in common whilst offering different solutions for theother problems.   The main items may be enumerated :  (a) Employment policy.   It seems most desirable that the Government shouldmake proposals about this at an early date, in any event beforeSir William Beveridge brings out his plan which will no doubt beboosted in the press like his social insurance scheme. The Govern-ment proposals would include plans to prevent depressed areas and todeal with fluctuations in the demand for our exports, which causedthe bulk of our unemployment in the inter-war period.(b) -Housing.  The Government is not committed to any particular programmeof house building, although it may be held to be committed to a largebuilding industry after the war. Doubts have been expressed as towhether we shall really be able to use for ten years all the plannedexpansion, but it is clear that for a number of years the demand forbuilding resources will exceed the supply and priorities will have tobe decided.(c) Education.   A detailed plan for improved education has been broughtforward with a general measure of agreement, but no dates have beenproposed. The extra cost to the Exchequer will rise to about 50 million a year, and complaint might have been made that theprospects of the other projects were thereby prejudiced.   But the
point has not .been raised, presumably because the rise to the 50 million a year level will take a good many years, during whichour taxable capacity should also increase.(d) Social security on the lines of the Beveridge Report is in the main anassimilation and expansion of existing services. Work on these plansis far advanced. Schemes are being considered for a comprehensivehealth service, and it would seem well to blend these with our socialsecurity plans so that we can put forward the Government proposals asan improvement on Beveridge rather than as a whittling down thereof..It is important to have these plans worked out in detail, even thoughit may not be intended to put them into effect before the election, sothat the transitional benefits, &amp;c, can be made to conform so far aspossible, thus preventing complications if and when the full schemecomes into effect.Group IV.7. In the fourth group may be put the large number of important questionswhich do not figure so much in public discussion as those in Group III. Wherethey are not going to cost a gieat deal and are non-controversial of course no onewould object to decisions; conversely only a few of them are excessively urgent,although it may be that the fluid period after the war is a convenient time toput some of them into operation. They are so numerous and complex that to listthe main items is about all that is feasible at this stage : &apos;Improvement in the machinery of central and local government.The organisation of railway and road transport.Public utilities, including the electrification of rural areas.The control of monopolies and the question of trade associations.Forestry.Colonial development.The falling population, probably the most important, but perhaps themost difficult long-term problem. The only line of action so far proposed isa committee of inquiry, although the family allowance plan might also beconsidered a population measure.8. At the root of all our internal problems lies, of course, the question ofhow the money is to be raised and the budget balanced, but the cost of defencemust bulk so largely in this that any estimate we can make now will be little morethan a guess.Group V.9. The fifth group comprises questions of international import which, ofcourse, we cannot decide without regard to the wishes of others. We can anddo say what solutions we should like and on many topics we are already negotia-ting. The Government have never shrunk from taking major decisions on thesequestions, and no doubt will take others as the progress of internationalnegotiations makes this necessary. Amongst topics of this nature may belisted :  (a) Security against war.   This will obviously be an important topic atUnited Nations Conferences. It wall probably be agreed that this isparamount and should govern our decisions on all other internationalquestions.(b) International economic arrangements.   These fall into four main classeswhich are already being discussed at Washington : (1) Monetary an endeavour to achieve stable currencies and start thepeace with reasonable credits for those needing them.(2) Commercial an attempt to reduce tariffs,  quotas and otherartificial barriers to trade.(3) Commodities a plan to create something in the nature of bufferstocks so as to iron out the worst fluctuations in the marketsof the world.(4) Investment proposals to direct foreign investment so as to leadto reasonable financial and economic equilibrium amongstnations.((&apos;) Relief to the liberated countries has been worked on for some years andplans have reached an advanced stage. Care should be taken toprevent confusion between these and. the general economic arrange-ments under (b).   Relief is or should be purely transitional.
(d) Civil aviation. This is, of course, closely linked with security. It ismaking good progress and no decisions here will be required untilAmerican and Russian reactions have been explored.10. In conclusion is appears that the only internal decisions we must takeare those concerning the transitional period from war to peace. It does not seemthat these need prejudge long-term solutions which should be worked out forsubmission to the public at an election, though inexpensive non-controversialprojects need, not necessarily be postponed. Obviously decisions on internationalquestions must be made as the need arises, and this has been and is being done.11. A genuine two-stage ending of the war, with Service demands reducedto, say, half, after Germany is defeated, would help greatly in the transition. Butthe figures so far available indicate that Service demands will not be very greathreduced by the defeat of Germany. If this proves true the real transition willcome after the collapse of the Japanese, in which case the election might precedethe transitional period.C.20th October, 1943.
