NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   H.M.S. Charybdis and one of H.M. destroyers have been sunk in theChannel.Light forces have successfully attacked a large number of E-boats off theEast Coast.Three Allied destroyers have been mined during operations to carry suppliesand reinforcements to Leros.Four U-boats have been sunk, one possibly sunk and one possibly damaged.Shipping losses have again been light.Home Waters.2. In the early hours of the.23rd, HALS. Charybdis (cruiser), in companywith six destroyers&quot; while proceeding to the westward off the north coast ofBrittany, was hit by two torpedoes and sunk. Shortly afterwards HALS.Limboume (destroyer) was also torpedoed and was subsequently sunk by our ownforces. No enemy ships were sighted. Four officers and 103 ratings were pickedup from the Charybdis and 11 officers, including the Captain, and 92 ratingsfrom Limbourne.3. On the night of the 24th/25th, about 30 E-boats operated off Cromer inthe vicinity of a coastal convoy. One ELM. Trawler, straggling from the convoy,was torpedoed and sunk. Later, the E-boats, which had split into small groups,were attacked by two destroyers and light coastal forces. Four E-boats were sunkand seven others damaged. Nineteen prisoners were taken. One M.G.B. andone M.T.B. sustained damage and casualties.H.M. Trawler Alfredian shot clown a twin-engined aircraft off Lowestoft onthe night of the 23rd.HALS. Cotsivold (destroyer) was seriously damaged in collision with HALS.Montrose (destroyer) off Cromer during the night of the 23rd/24th.North Atlantic.4. On the 23rd, a group of infantry landing craft, returning to the UnitedKingdom from the Mediterranean, were attacked by aircraft north-west of CapeFinisterre. L.C.I. 309 was sunk and LCI. 185 was seriously damaged, butreached port.Mediterranean.5. Allied coastal craft have maintained patrols in the Elba area. On thenight of the 19th/20th, U.S. patrol boats torpedoed a tank-landing lighter andpossibly a small tanker in convoy off Leghorn. Two nights later US. patrol boatssank an escorted 5,000-ton ammunition ship south-east of Elba.On the 23rd, HALS. Cromarty (minesweeper) was mined and sunk in theStrait of Bonifacio.6. Coastal craft have operated in the Central Adriatic but no interceptionshave been reported. On the night of the .20th/21st, HAL Destroyers Tyrian andTumult sank the ex-Yugoslav trawler Bojano, with a German armed guard onboard, off Ulcinj (Albania), and on the following evening in the same localityH.M.S. Quilliam (destroyer) captured a 1,300-ton ship, and sent her into Bari.7. During the week, the 1st to the 8th October, the totals unloaded throughthe ports and beaches used to supply the Fifth Army were : 25,572 tons of stores,2,541 vehicles and 18,292 personnel. Between the 6th and the 11th the EighthArmy received through Taranto, Brindisi and Bari, 34,720 tons of stores, 2,134vehicles and 38,684. personnel. Other Eighth Army ports and beaches, betweenthe 5th and 14th, handled a small quantity of stores, 1,796 vehicles and 5,747personnel.On the 25th, at Bizerta, the Italian Naval Authorities returned to the FrenchNavy the torpedo boat Trombe which the Italians had seized at Toulon lastNovember.
Levant.8. On the 17th, ELM. schooner Hedgehog is presumed to have been lost whiletrying to evacuate German prisoners from Levitha. .    .H.M.S. Aurora (cruiser) and the Greek destroyer Miaoules bombarded Rhodeson the night of the 20th/21st and on the following evening three destroyersbombarded Levitha. H.M.S. Hurworth (destroyer), in company with H.M.S.Beaufort (destroyer), was slightly damaged by fire from shore batteries whilebombarding Kos harbour on the night of the 18th/ 19th. On the following nightM.T.B.s hit a small ship and destroyed an ammunition lighter off the north coastof Kos.Between the 14th and the 23rd ELM. and Allied destroyers landed 267 per-sonnel, 160 tons of stores and ammunition, six guns and 22 light vehicles atLeros. On the 26th, three destroyers landed a further 310 personnel and 40 tonsof supplies.  H.M. submarines have also carried stores to Leros.. On the night of the 22nd/23rd, during a diversionary sweep off the east coastof Kalymnos, H.M.S. Hurworth (destroyer) and the Greek destroyer A drias raninto an enemy minefield. Hurworth blew up; some survivors are known to havebeen picked up. Adrias had her fore-part blown off, and has been beached on theTurkish coast : there were about 20 killed and 20 wounded. On the night of the23rd/24th, H.M.S. Eclipse (destroyer), while in company with three destroyerseach carrying 200 troops for Leros, was mined and sunk east of Kalymnos.H.M.S. Petard (destroyer) picked up 44 survivors and it is hoped that others weresaved by small craft from Leros.It is now known that the Italian gunboat Azio, after being attacked northof Leros, entered Kulluk (Turkey) and was interned on the 10th.Pacific.9.   The U.S. S/M Dorado is reported overdue and must be considered lost.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. Twenty-nine attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week.Seventeen of these were by surface craft, 11 by aircraft and one by a submarine.On the 20th and 21st two U-boats were sunk by aircraft from U.S.S. Core (aux.-carrier) north of the Azores. ELM. destroyers Duncan and Vidette, escorting awestbound convoy, sank a U-boat south-west of Iceland (C) on the 23rd. AWellington sank a U-boat off the Portuguese coast on the 24th : forty-ninesurvivors were landed at Vigo. A U-boat was possibly sunk by ELM. S/MUntiring off Toulon on the 15th.H.M.S. Onslaught (destroyer) rammed and possibly damaged a U-boat in theGreenland Sea on the 20th.Enemy Intelligence.11. Lutzow has left Gdynia since the 10th and Hipper has arrived.Number g is reported to have been slightly damaged by air attack. Scheer wasreported at Swinemunde on the 23rd.Ten destroyers, six torpedo boats and approximately 60 E-boats, 80 R-boats,90 minesweepers and 25 landing craft are at present disposed in Channel andBiscay ports.In the Levant a number of small ex-Italian warships, including destroyersand torpedo-boats, are being recommissioned by the Germans.An assault convoy is being assembled in the Piraeus. In the Leros area theacute shortage of serviceable lighters and other small craft is considered to havedelayed the attack.U-boats.12. It is estimated that the main concentration of U-boats has shiftedsouth-westward to an area east of Newfoundland.There are a number of U-boats west of Portugal, some of which may attemptto. enter the Mediterranean, to reinforce the existing strength which is estimatedat 15.Two or three U-boats are probably patrolling south of Spitzbergen.[26316] B 2
Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked and sunk fourships. One ship was sunk off Rio de Janeiro and another in the MozambiqueChannel. Two ships were sunk by gunfire from U-boats off Freetown and AdduAtoll respectively.Two ships, in a west-bound convoy, were sunk by aircraft off Tehez.Aircraft also damaged one ship north-west of Cape Finisterre and another atNaples.A ship was damaged by mine off Brindisi.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending the 23rd, 782 ships were convoyed. Of these,160 ships were in ocean convoys and 622 in British coastal convoys. Two escort-carriers, one ocean boarding vessel, 70 destroyers (including six U.S. destroyers)and 124 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including 19 U.S. cutters) wereemployed on escort duties.Four ocean convoys, consisting of 88 ships, arrived in Home Waters withoutloss.British Minelaying.15. Minelaying was carried out by surface craft off the Belgian and DutchCoasts, and by aircraft off the German North Sea coast, in the Kattegat and offthe Dutch Coast.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. On two nights of the week enemy aircraft probably laid mines off theEast Coast. Although E-boats were operating off Harwich and Cromer there isno evidence of minelaying.Eight ground and three moored mines have been destroyed during the week.Mine totals are : 4,537 ground and 3,477 moored.17. On the 25th an enemy minefield was located off Brincfisi and 11 magneticmines have so far been destroyed. U.S. minesweepers have recently destroyed59 moored mines at Cagliari. Enemy moored mines are suspected in the WesternApproaches to the -oEgean. Two more moored mines have been destroyed offSt. John&apos;s, Newfoundland.Enemy Merchant Shipping.18. It is reported that the German s.s. Stuttgart (13,387 tons), which wasdamaged during the air raid on Gdynia on the 9th, was later towed out to seaand sunk.The Belgian s.s. Mar Del Plata (7,340 tons) was damaged by sabotage atCopenhagen on the 19th, and the Italian tanker Fulgor (6,504 tons) was damagedby an under-water explosion at Cadiz on the 24th.During recent weeks there has been a movement of enemy ships from theBay of Biscay and Channel ports towards the North Sea. The Germans.s. Livaolia (3.094 tons), previously engaged in the ore trade, sailed fromBoulogne heavily escorted early this month. The German s.s. Nordvard(4,111 tons), after leaving Bordeaux in May 1942 and spending several monthsin dock at Lorient and Nantes, sailed eastward from Boulogne on the night ofthe 25th/26th. The German s.s. Mtmsterland (6,408 tons), previously a blockade-runner, reached Brest from Bordeaux early in the month and was seen inCherbourg on the 24th. An eastbound ship, which was sunk off Le Touquet at theend of September, is believed to have been the Vichy s.s. Madali (3,014 tons), whicharrived at Havre at the beginning of August.These movements may continue, and possibly increase, due to the urgent needof shipping in Northern Waters, and the increasing difficulties of blockade-running from Biscay ports to the Far East now that the Azores has become anAllied base.Italian Merchant Shipping.19. Thirteen Italian ships (29,711 tons) and a number of small ships haverecently been handed over to the Allies in the Mediterranean.
MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad-Gomel Sector.20. The Germans have reported Russian attacks during the week at thefollowing points: north of Lake Ilmen; south-east of Velikie Luki; west ofSmolensk and east of Mohilev. No confirmation of these reports has come fromthe Russians.Gomel-Loev Sector.21. Fighting has continued in the area of the Russian bridgehead over theRiver Soj, south of Gomel. Further south, at Loev, the Russians have extendedtheir bridgehead across the Dnieper.Kiev Sector.22. The situation in the bridgeheads north of Kiev is not entirely clear,but it appears that, in spite of German counter-attacks, the Russians haveconsolidated their positions and have possibly made progress at some points.Fighting has also taken place at the bridgehead south of Pereyaslavl, but neitherside has reported progress.Kremenchug Sector.23. The Russian bridgehead south-east of Kremenchug has been furtherdeepened, and Russian forces are now within four miles of Krivoi Rog. TheGermans have been resisting strongly, and on the 25th launched a counter-attackagainst the right flank of the Russian salient, which does not appear to havehad more than a temporary effect in relieving the German forces in theKrivoi Rog area.On the 25th the Russians captured Dnepropetrovsk and since then havecontinued to advance south-westwards.Zaporozhe-Melitopol Sector.24. The Russians have made some slight progress southwards fromZaporozhe. Their most striking progress in this sector, however, has been furthersouth, for, after capturing Melitopol on the 23rd, they have now advancedwestwards on a broad front and have taken a town 23 miles north-west ofMelitopol itself.General.25. The Russians have had an outstanding success in extending theirbridgehead to within a few miles of Krivoi Rog. As a result the German forcesfurther east were seriously endangered and were forced to withdraw underpressure from Dnepropetrovsk.Further south, the Germans have been driven from the Zaporozhe-Melitopolline to which they were still clinging precariously a week ago.These two converging advances threaten not only the German forces in thegeneral area Melitopol-Zaporozhe, but also the German supply of NikopolManganese.Italy.&apos; 26. Slow progress has been made during the past week against enemyrearguards which are fighting with skill and determination in good defensivecountry.27. In the Eighth Army sector enemy rearguards withdrew from the RiverTrigno on the 22nd, and the following day the bridgehead over this river wasfirmly established some six miles from the sea. By the 27th British troops wereacross from the bridgehead to the sea and were approaching S. Salvo. Furtherinland fighting patrols followed up and harassed the enemy, and by the 27thhad forced him back into the hills beyond Montefalcone.On the left flank Canadian troops maintained their pressure against strongenemy resistance. Defensive positions had been established along the line of theRiver Biferno to protect the important road and rail junction of Bojano. Anattack was put in on the night of the 23rd, and by the following morning tanks
and guns were over the river in spite of very heavy enemy shell-fire. Bojanowas now out-flanked and under observation from the north and the south, andthe town was finally captured on the 25th. Canadian troops were then directedon Torella and Molise, both strongly held, and after heavy fighting these twovillages were in our hands by the 27th.28. On the Fifth Army front American troops have made good progress inthe mountains, and contact has been maintained by patrols over the Matesemountain range with the left flank of the Eighth Army. Advancing overprecipitous country against enemy rearguards and mines they capturedRaviseanina on the 25th and the following day mounted an attack againstPietravairano and the high ground surrounding it. This attack was supportedby a heavy artillery and air bombardment and satisfactory progress was made,the town being captured on the 27th. Forwmrd troops are now- pressing ontowards the main road beyond Vairano.On the coast British troops have maintained contact with the enemy by activepatrolling, but have not yet advanced far beyond the canal. On the 22nd theenenry made a detmanined counter-attack from their strong positions aroundMondragone, but this was broken up and thrown back. Our troops have sincemade some progress along the Capua-Minturno road, capturing Sparanise onthe 25th and Francolise the following clay.29. The supply of our fighting troops still presents a considerable problem.Bridging facilities are strained to their limits and the development of the portof Naples is slow owing to the demolition and blockage of the clocks.iEgean.30.   Leros has been reinforced by one battalion.The Germans have now occupied the islands of Stampalia and Levitha,the latter lying 25 miles to the south-east of Leros.Burma.31. Japanese patrol activity continues in the Chin Hills but there arestill no signs that they intend any large-scale advance.On the Burman-Yunnan border Chinese troops, who were west of theSalween, are reported to have withdrawn to the east bank of the river. TheJapanese now control the west bank for about 90 miles north of the Burma Road.New Guinea.32. There has been severe fighting in the Finschhafen area. On the 17th,the Japanese, who had been holding positions about five miles west of Finschhafen,attacked down the Song River, and at one time reached the coast about sixmiles north of Finschhafen, presumably with the object of making contact withthree Japanese landing barges which attempted a landing on the same day.By the 22nd they had been driven back from the coast with 510 killed and arenow back to their original positions. During the 23rd and 24th, the Japaneselaunched four heavy attacks on Australian positions in the area, all of whichwere repulsed with heavy losses to the enemy.Mopping up still continues in the Lae area.In the Ramu Valley, Australian forces have been patrolling actively.They have encountered a Japanese defensive position 13 miles west-south-westof Bogadjim but have reached points 30 miles west and 21 miles south-west ofBogadjim without encountering any opposition.AIR SITUATION.General Review.33. Bombing operations by home-based aircraft were curtailed byunfavourable weather conditions, but a heavy attack was made on Kassel.Attacks in Italy were concentrated on enemy communications and airfields.Railway centres and airfields were bombed in Yugoslavia and Albania.Heavy bombing attacks were made on enemy airfields in the Solomons andNew Britain; a large number of enemy aircraft was destroyed.
United Kingdom.34. In daylight, no enemy aircraft were overland, but one F.W. 190 onreconnaissance was shot down south of Dungeness.At night, harassing raids over eastern and south-eastern England occurred onfive nights. About 43 enemy aircraft were involved and London appeared to bethe main target, but not more than 10 aircraft managed to penetrate to that areaon any occasion-; bombs fell at widely scattered points. One F.W. 190 was shotdown and two Mosquitoes are missing.Home Waters.35. Aircraft of Fighter Command attacked shipping at Cherbourg and St.Malo and off the French Coast; a 6,500-ton ship was seriously damaged, a smallship was sunk and three other small ships and a destroyer were damaged. ABeaufighter of Coastal Command attacked two trawlers off the Frisian Islandssetting one on fire.   Five aircraft are missing from these operations.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 70 were despatched, laid 209 sea-mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.36. Two hundred and sixty-six Marauders (B.26), out of 287 despatched,attacked three airfields in Northern France, dropping 379 tons of bombs withgood results. Four other airfields in Northern France and two in Holland wereattacked by Mitchells (B. 25) and Typhoon bombers, which dropped 68 tons; manybursts were seen among hangars, repair shops and in the dispersal areas.Thirty-six Bostons (A. 20) were despatched to make a low-level attack on anaircraft repair factory in Belgium, but the target was not located and no bombswere dropped. Spitfires, Mustangs (P. 51), Whirlwinds and Typhoons attackedrailway and other targets in Northern France; a power station, a railway bridgeand 32 locomotives were damaged.Allied fighters flew 2,834 sorties. Bombers and fighters destroyed 22 enemyaircraft, probably destroyed ten and damaged 29 for the loss of six Bostons(A. 20), three Mitchells (B. 25) and 11 fighter-bombers and fighters.Night.37. On the 22nd/23rd, 569 aircraft of Bomber Command were despatchedto Cassel; 486 attacked, dropping 1,824 tons of bombs. Adverse weather withthick cloud and icing conditions was experienced en route, but over the targetthere was practically no cloud and good visibility. The marker bombs wereaccurately placed, well maintained and clearly seen by all crews. A. particularlyconcentrated attack was delivered and photographs taken at the time confirm thatthis was the case. A large number of enemy fighters was encountered, six of whichwere destroyed.   Forty-three of our aircraft did not return from this operation.On the same night, 33 aircraft out of 36 despatched, attacked Frankfurt,dropping 95 tons in good visibility.. The marker bombs were scattered, butseveral good fires were started in the target area.  One aircraft is missing.A total of 43 Mosquitoes, one of which is missing, made small-scale attackson Emden, Cologne, Dortmund, Dtisseldorf, Buderich (near Diisseldorf) andEheinhausen (near Duisburg).&quot;Intruder&quot; aircraft of Fighter Command flew 22 sorties over NorthernFrance, the Low Countries and North-West Germany; one aircraft is missing.Leaflets were dropped on several French towns by a total of 28 aircraft of BomberCommand.Italy.38. Enemy lines of communication were subjected to heavy attacks bybombers and fighter-bombers.Road and railway bridges on routes leading to Rome were attacked by heavyand medium bombers with good results. Serious damage was caused to bridgesat Grosseto (80 miles NW. of Rome), Orvieto (60 miles N.N.W. of Rome),Montalto di Castro (55 miles NW. of Rome); Albinia (70 miles N.W. of Rome),and Acquapendente (N. of Lake Bolsena).   In addition, attacks were made on
Pistoria, Terni (45 miles N. of Rome), Marsciano (70 miles N. of Rome), and onother targets; in all these raids heavy damage was caused to railroad tracksand roads, some of which were rendered impassable.On the East Coast the railway lines and approaches to bridges at PortoCivitanova were bombed by over 50 Wellingtons.In the battle area light bombers and fighter-bombers concentrated on bridges,road and railway junctions, M.T., bivouac areas, gun positions, and targetsrequested by the Army. Fighter-bombers displayed great activity and carriedout widespread armed reconnaissances, attacking road movement and objectives50 miles north of Rome on the West and in the Ancona area in the East. Directhits were obtained on at least four bridges; several locomotives, barges and anammunition train were destroyed, and about 250 M.T. vehicles were destroyed ordamaged, a large proportion of which Avas near Ancona.Successful attacks were made on airfields in the Rome area, resulting in thedestruction on the ground of 40 aircraft and six others were damaged; hangarsand other buildings were hit: Fighter-bombers destroyed eight additionalaircraft.Enemy reaction to our numerous raids was on a limited scale and combatswere not frequent. Fighters flew regularly, although mostly in small formations,and occasional sweeps were made over the battle area, but activity was mostlydefensive. A night raid by 40-50 bombers was made on Naples, but reportsindicate only slight damage in proportion to the scale of the attack; a furtherattack by about 20 aircraft resulted in a ship carrying cased petrol being seton fire. A convoy off the North African coast was attacked by 25 aircraft. Inthese attacks ten enemy aircraft were shot down.Mediterranean.Dodecanese. Crete and Greece.39. Operations by Allied aircraft were restricted by the unserviceability oflanding grounds in Cyrenaica. Two attacks by a total of 16 heavy bombers weremade on Maritsa airfield (Rhodes) and nine others bombed Heraklion landing-ground (Crete). Shipping protection patrols for naval units were provided, byBeaufighters. Successful raids by a total of over 60 Mitchells (B. 25) were madeon Athens/Eleusis, Salonika/Sides and Mikra airfields.Supplies were dropped for patriot forces in Greece.Increased enemy attacks on shipping in the Dodecanese and Corfu areasoccurred on most days of the week, and on the harbours of Leros and Samos.Leros received daily attacks, the chief target being the harbour at Porto Lago.On the 26th, 120 enemy aircraft attacked the defences and gun positions.A heavy bomber attack including about 50 dive-bombers preceded theoccupation of Stampalia on the 22nd.Yugoslavia and Albania.40. A good attack by 36 Mitchells (B. 25) was made on Nish. About 750units of rolling stock were present, and 70 hits were obtained on the railway yards,the locomotive repair buildings and on tracks; the round house was left in flamesand the line to Belgrade and Sofia was cut at two points. The railway centre atSkoplje was attacked by 24 Lightnings (P. 38) and 43 locomotives were damaged.Mitchells (B. 25) bombed the airfield at Podgorica (62 miles E.S.E. of Dubroonik)and damaged or destroyed 11 aircraft on the ground.Two attacks on Tirana airfield resulted in 25 aircraft being destroyed ordamaged on the ground and. a Ju. 52 was shot down as it was about to land.Supplies were dropped for patriot forces.Attacks on Shipping.41. Fighter-bombers carried out anti-shipping sweeps over the Adriatic Sea;they set on fire six small ships near Zara and shot down five Ju. 87s. Two vesselsof 5,000 and.3,000 tons were attacked and the deck cargo of one was left burning.Russia.42. The Russian Air Force maintained consistent support throughout theweek for their ground forces advancing on Krivoi Rog, and it is in this areathat the main concentration of effort appears to have been directed.   There was
also considerable activity over the bridgeheads in the area south of Rechitsa.At the end of the week, attacks were made on German airfields in the Melitopolarea, where much damage is also stated to have been inflicted on troop and trans-port concentrations.The important railway junction of Znamenka was bombed every night ofthe week; the stations of Nikopol and Fastov, 37 miles south-west of Kiev, wereattacked on five nights. Other railway objectives raided during the week includeDahankoi, in the Crimea, Dolinskaya, 30 miles north-west of Krivoi Rog, andApostolovo, 22 miles south-west of Krivoi Rog.Following a marked improvement in weather conditions in South Russiawhich set in about the 20th October, the forces of the G.A.F. in the area of theDnieper Bend, reinforced by close-support aircraft from the Central Front,greatly intensified the scale of effort against the deep Russian penetration southof Krementschug. It is probable that long-range bombers from the Kiev andMelitopol sectors were also thrown into the fighting but as the Russian captureof Dnepropetrovsk shows even G.A.F. operations on a greatly increased scalefailed to exert any decisive influence on the course of the battle.India and Burma.43. Successful attacks were again made on. enemy communications. Amongrailway targets hit were stations at Rangoon and Sagaing, locomotive sheds atKanbalu (90 miles N.N.W. of Mandalay), yards at Prome and Myingyan, andseveral bridges in the same areas. On the Irrawaddy and other rivers, four largesteamers and many barges and sampans were damaged..... Attacks were also made on other targets, including landing-grounds, dumpsand troop concentrations in different parts of the country. About 120 tons ofsupplies were dropped for Allied troops in the Chin Hills and at Sumprabum inUpper Burma.Enemy aircraft attacked Tembru Ghat, near Cox&apos;s Bazar, where huts andM.T. were damaged and casualties caused, and Chittagong, where several bombsfell in the harbour area.Pacific Zone.Solomons.44. Heavy bombing attacks were made on enemy landing grounds at Kahiliand Kara (Bougainville Island) and Ballale (Shortland Island); 23 aircraft weredestroyed on the ground and Kahili landing-ground was rendered unserviceable.Attacks were also made on enemy bivouacs and positions on,Choiseul Island. Offthe coasts, one small ship and several barges were sunk, and a ship of the carriertype, a destroyer and some barges were damaged.New Britain.45. The principal targets were enemy airfields near Rabanl, on which severalheavy attacks were made by escorted heavy and medium bombers. It is reportedthat 86 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground and a further 95 destroyedin combat for the loss of five Allied aircraft. Successful attacks were made onthe dump area at Gasmata and- on shipping; an enemy destroyer was probablysunk and several barges were either sunk or damaged.New Guinea.46. In the Finschhafen area, Allied aircraft made heavy attacks on targetsat and near Sattelberg and Wareo, nearly 300 tons being dropped with goodresults.In the Madang area, medium bombers attacked the landing-ground atAlexishafen and huts, dumps and bridges near Bogadyim.&apos;In the Wewak area, attacks were made on the landing-grounds and otherobjectives at Dagua and But; 20 aircraft on the ground and several barges weredestroyed or damaged.In North-West New Guinea, Liberators (B. 24) bombed Manokwari andSank a small ship off the coast.In spite of great Allied air superiority, the Japanese air force in NewGuinea is by no means immobilised. On the contrary, the enemy&apos;s scale ofeffort has even increased and the bridgehead at Finschhafen has been regularlyattacked by considerable forces of aircraft.[26316] c&apos;
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.49.   No enemy bombing occurred during the hours of daylight.On the first five nights of the period bombs were dropped in East Anglia andSouth-East England, the Greater London area being affected on four nights.Damage was of a minor character; there were no fatal and only a few seriouscasualties except on the night of the 22nd/23rd when seven persons were killedand nine seriously injured at Orpington.On the night of the 25th/26th, the Kent coast was shelled in reply to ourown batteries; six persons were killed and eight seriously injured.Casualties.50. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours onthe 27th were 26 killed and 72 seriously injured; of these, 13 were killed and37 seriously injured in the raid on the night of the 20th/21st. reported in lastweek&apos;s Resume.APPENDICES I, II and III will be published periodically.APPENDIX IY.Enemy Merchant Ship Losses assessed to 30th September, 1943.Nationality.

Frankfurt. A final interpretation of photographs, taken after the attack onthe 4th/5th October, confirms the heavy damage to the east of the town, andparticularly to the East Harbour area. Altogether 37 factories have beendamaged in this attack, and these include Voigt u. Hefther A.G. (range finders) (Priority 2).  Previously reported.Messer and Co. (welding apparatus) (Priority 2).   Previously reported.Nexes Union (grinding wheels) (Priority 1).Collet u. Engelhardt (machine tools) (Priority 2).Lurgi Ges. fur Chemie u.

After the attack on Mannheim on the 4th/5th October, theauthorities had considerable difficulty in controlling the population, owing todelay in carrying out evacuation. Order was not restored till the evening.

Difficulty in the maintenance of order at both Frankfurt and Munichafter recent attacks has also been reported. One of the noticeable features in thesetwo towns has been the refusal of the population to go to shelters.Prance.Transformer Stations.
