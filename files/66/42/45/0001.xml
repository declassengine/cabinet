THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET /     Copy No.,W.P. (43) 495. /26th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1943 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA,   BURMA   AND   THE   COLONIES   AND   MANDATEDTERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.GENERAL.DISCUSSIONS which have been in progress for some time regarding the-constitution of the Combined Food Board and the London Food Committee wereconcluded during October. The object of these discussions was to determinewhether, and if so in what way, this combined food-planning organisation couldbe strengthened to enable it to carry out with the maximum efficiency theincreasingly important work which will fall upon it. In particular the positionof Canada was under review in the light of her contribution as a major supplierof food-stuffs and of the close inter-relationship of all North American foodproblems.2. The arrangements agreed upon were summarised in a public announce-ment made on the 29th October; briefly these were : Canada joins the United Kingdom and the United States as a member ofthe Combined Food Board at Washington.The London Food Committee is reconstituted as the London Food Council.The Minister of Food will be Chairman, and the High Commissioners in Londonfor the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africaand Southern Rhodesia, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary ofState for India and the Representative of India at the War Cabinet will bemembers.CANADA.3. Simultaneously with the announcement made by the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, United States, and Soviet Union, that they regarded Italy asa co-belligerent in the war against Germany, an official statement was issued inOttawa stating that the Canadian Government had been kept informed of theproceedings leading up to the announcement, and were in general agreement withits terms.4. In home affairs the possibility of a general election for the FederalParliament in Canada appears to have been dispelled by Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;sspeech, in which he expressed the hope that there would be no need for such anelection until the war was over.5. The Archbishop and Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in Canadahave issued a statement authorising the faithful to support any political partyupholding the basic Christian principles, but condemning Communism as beinga totalitarian system materialistic in its philosophy.[26446] B
6. As a result of the difficult man-power situation in Canada, the Depart-ment of Labour has issued an order freezing labour in certain named employments.This order goes a good deal further than previous measures, the purpose of whichhad been primarily to weed labour out of non-essential industries.7. M. Maxine Raymond, leader of &quot; Bloc Populaire &quot; in Quebec, recentlybroadcast an address on the policj&apos; of his party. He demanded such things as aseparate national anthem, and the appointment of a Canadian to fill the post ofGovernor-General. In foreign policy he formulated two principles: (a) theneutrality of Canada in any international crisis which did not endanger Canadianinterests, and (b) the refusal to assume international responsibility imposed,directly or indirectly, by another Power. This party, however, enjoys no generalsupport, and no undue importance can be attached Lo its activities.8. Canada has had a further outbreak of strikes. 8,500 miners are onstrike in Western Canada and, as a result, there has been a drop in the coalproduction in Alberta of between 85 and 90 per cent. A strike at the ShawiniganFalls aluminium works has since been settled.9. The report of the National War Labour Board has not yet been published,but it is understood to include compulsory arbitration of all Labour disputesduring war-time, and to make provision for the expansion and acceleration of themachinery for dealing with Labour questions by the Board itself.10. Among visitors to Canada during the month was Dr. Fernandez, ForeignMinister of Chile. Others were the President of Hayti, and Field-Marshal Sir-John Dill, who has been in Canada on a tour of inspection of military and airinstallations; and members of the United States-Brazil Joint Defence Board.11. The Fifth Victory Loan Campaign opened on the 18th October with anobjective of 81,200,000,000. In so far as it is possible to judge from the first fewdays of the campaign, and from comparison with the course of previous VictoryLoans, it seems likely that the loan will again be over-subscribed.Naval, Military and A ir A ctivities.12. Throughout October the F,rst Canadian Division continued to operatein the left centre of the 8th Army in the sector north-east of the Lucera-Iserniaroad and roughly in the middle of Italy where the terrain is mountainous anddifficult and lends itself to defensive fighting. The Germans have not failed totake full advantage of such a situation in adding to the difficulties of the groundby large-scale demolitions. Their rearguard fighting has been well conductedand stubborn.13. The month opened with renewed activity by the 8th Army in the coastalsector, the Canadians at this time being at Lucera. A landing by Commandoson the 3rd resulted in the capture of Termoli and strong reaction on the part ofthe Germans who promptly moved a panzer division over fom the west. Fiercefighting ensued, causing a. slight withdrawal by our troops south of Termolion the 5th but by the 7th the German counter-attack had. spent its force and aCanadian advance south of Larino, which strengthened our positions inland,helped towards the renewal of our offensive. The Canadian Division, continuingits progress, captured Campobasso on the 14th and Vinchiaturo the following day.Maintaining their pressure against strong enemy resistance along the riverBiferno the Canadians attacked on the night of the 23rd, crossed the Bifernoand succeeded in out-flanking Bojano which fell on the 25th. Following upsteadily they captured Torella and Molise on the 27th, although both were stronglyheld by the Germans.14. During October, 29 R.C.A.F. squadrons were employed in the UnitedKingdom, two overseas, three were in transit and one was in process of formation.Bad weather curtailed operations throughout the month and also in some measureaccounted for rather higher losses, especially in the case of the raid on Kassel,when severe icing conditions were responsible for a number of casualties. Duringthe period 45 bombers were reported missing, three crashed on return, one wasabandoned over this country and. one came down in the sea through lack ofpetrol a few miles off the coast. Four coastal aircraft, seven day fighters and onenight fighter were lost, also one intruder aircraft which hit a balloon cable.
15. R.C.A.F. aircraft in the United Kingdom accounted for 18 enemyaircraft destroyed and one U-boat probably destroyed. A Sunderland was shotdown into the sea by a U-boat but 7 of the crew were rescued. No. 43 squadronstationed in Ceylon now operates from the Seychelles and Aden as well as fromits home base.AUSTRALIA.16. Now that the Federal elections are over, Australia is facing the after-math of some pre-election speeches. The optimism expressed in some of thesespeeches continues, in spite of many press warnings that the edge of Japaneseresistances had only been scratched, and the lack of public support for the newCommonwealth  125 million Liberty Loan campaign is to some extent explainedby the complacency which the speeches engendered.17. The coal situation, which was to some extent under control prior to the;elections, has now become serious. The Commonwealth Government are beingcriticised for ineffectual handling of the coal situation and for opposition to theidea of nationalisation, as advocated by the Miners&apos; Federation. Mr. Curtintold the miners&apos; representatives on the 27th October that the need for greater coal,production in Australia was such that the next 18 months would be critical,because, for the first time, the war had involved shortages in Australia&apos;s meansof subsistence. He said that both Trades Unions and employers must abandontheir &quot;give me&quot; attitude. The miners&apos; leaders pledged themselves at themeeting to do everything possible to ensure maximum production.18. It was announced on the 21st October that the Commonwealth Govern-ment had decided to introduce meat rationing next January. It is understoodthat the ration will be on a points basis, enabling adults to purchase an averageof 2\ lbs. butcher&apos;s weight weekly and children under 9 years half this amount.19. Considerable interest was shown in the Government announcement thata committee had been set up to consider immigration from the United Kingdom.The Sydney Morning Herald commented that the United Kingdom was now avery uncertain source of settlers, and that prejudice against suitable foreignsettlers must go. In this connection the Australian press gave prominence toSir John Latham&apos;s address at the Royal Empire Society in October, at which hesaid that the White Australia policy must be dropped.20. The United Kingdom Press Mission, and the Lethbridge Mission bothreceived a warm welcome on arrival. To the leaders of the former Mr. Curtin,the Prime Minister, said that if he &quot; spoke for a year, I could not fully expressAustralia&apos;s gratitude to the people of Britain, whose heroism and the statecraftof whose leaders would go down in history.&quot; He also said that Australianswere to be regarded not only as Australians, but as &quot; British people holding agreat bastion for the Empire. Australia felt that it could speak to Great Britainas the parent country, but it thought also that it was entitled to make it plain toeverybody that Australia had grown up to the stature of full manhood. TheBritish Commonwealth of Nations is more important than any of its parts.&quot;The latter Mission, led by Major-General Lethbridge, has been especially wellreceived, as it is considered to be evidence of the fulfilment of Mr. ChurchilLsstatement that the war in the Pacific formed one of his first considerations. TheMission is at present studying Australian methods of training, equipment, andthe need of weapons most suited to the Pacific war.21. Australia has appointed High Commissioners to India and NewZealand, the persons concerned being Lieutenant-General Sir Iven MacKay, andMr. George Dalton. These appointments are felt by Australians to be opportuneas there had been a feeling that representation within the British Commonwealthhad been neglected in favour of more Australian representation in. foreigncountries.22. Dr. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, in a statement in the Houseof Representatives declared that Australia must have a say in helping to decideEurope&apos;s post-war problems. &quot; Australia has done her fair share in Dutting outthe fire, and our right, full and active part in planning the peace should beassured as a result of what Australians have done in winning the war. Australiacannot safely limit her interests even to the gigantic area of the Pacific. Our[26446] n o
concern with Europe cannot be limited to the waging of wars. We must havesome say in taking steps to prevent wars, and in changing conditions which arelikely to come.&quot;23. In introducing the Commonwealth budget the Treasurer said inconnection with the man-power position that the limit of man-power had nowbeen reached, with the result that production capacity was lagging behind supplycommitments. The Army is to release 20,000 men for work, 15,000 for work onthe land and the others in Industry.24. One Minesweeper and one Auxiliary Minesweeper were commissionedfor the Royal Australian Navy during the month.25. The 3rd Australian Armoured Division has now been deleted from theOrder of Battle and, with certain exceptions, units of this Division are to beabsorbed and the personnel converted to Infantry reinforcements.26. In consequence of the deletion of the 1st Australian Armoured Divisionfrom the Order of Battle, as reported last month, and also of the 3rd AustralianArmoured Division, the armoured units remaining are two Armoured Brigades,one Armoured Regiment, two Tank Battalion Groups and one Armoured CarRegiment.27. Owing to the decrease in the intake of recruits there has been areorganisation of training establishments which will result in a saving of man-power as regards the instructional and administrative staffs. There has alsobeen a reduction in certain Army and L. of C. area schools by which man-powercan be saved owing to reduced intake of students.28. Instructions have been issued to implement the Governments decisionto release 20,000 men from the Army to Industry. This process will be spreadover a period of 10 months. The 2,000 men released each month are in additionto the normal discharges which average about 4,000 per month. As the intakeof recruits is limited to 1,500 men and women per month the net decrease will beabout 4,500 per month.29. The strength of the Australian Military Forces on the 16th Octoberwas Total       ............      493,51530. The total number of United States forces in Australia at the end ofOctober, including Air Corps and Anti-Aircraft Units, was 277,356, all ranks.-31. The New Zealand authorities are understood to have resentedGeneral MacArthuPs communique reporting the capture of Vella Lavella byUnited States forces, and the Prime Minister issued a statement, with theauthority of the Commander in the South Pacific, that &apos;&apos; New Zealand forceshave played a major role in the taking of the Island.&quot;32. Controversy continues to rage over the question whether the men of theNew Zealand Division now on furlough in New Zealand from the Mediterraneantheatre of war should be sent back there. Most of the newspapers support theGovernments decision to send back all except selected classes of men, but theAuckland Star is advocating the gradual release to civil life of all veterans ofthis Division, on the ground that they have already done more than their- share.It is evident from letters which have been published in New Zealand papers thatthere is discontent among the New Zealand troops in the Middle East, which issaid to be due to the failure to understand why they are being kept in theMiddle East when troops are so urgently needed in the Pacific, and to resentmentat the reported bad behaviour of United States troops in New Zealand. A leadingarticle in the Observer expresses sympathy with these letters and criticises theUnited States troops, whose &quot; tall talk &quot; is contrasted in outspoken terms withpoor performance in action.Naval, Military and Air Activities.Men ..Women465,64727,868NEW ZEALAND.
33. The prevailing spirit of optimism in New Zealand is partly explainedby the Governments decision to remove the A.R.P. restrictions, on the groundthat the threat to New Zealand can now be regarded as over. One instance ofthis spirit is that the petrol ration for the two summer months has now beendoubled.34. Rationing of butter began in New Zealand on the 28th October, theration being 8 ozs. a week. There will be a proportionate decrease in consumptionbv manufacturers and collective customers.35. The Lethbridge Mission has visited New Zealand, and a statementwhich was issued in New Zealand emphasised that the advent of the Missionshowed the United Kingdom Governments determination to make the maximumcontribution to the Pacific war as soon as the European war is over.36. The Labour Party has re-elected the Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser,Leader of the party, and Mr. Walter Nash, the Finance Minister, Deputy Leader.37. The final state of the parties in the General Election held last monthcannot yet be stated with certainty, but at the present time the Government havea majority of 12, the figures being : Labour 45, National Party 34, Independent(who is pro-Labour) 1.   The service votes have still to be received and counted.38. The Prime Minister underwent an operation, from the effects of whichhe is now said to be recovering, at the end of October,39. The posthumous award of the Victoria Cross to a Maori was theoccasion for enthusiastic native celebrations.Naval, Military and Air Activities.40. H.M.N.Z. Trawler Tui, whiie escorting a convoy, detected a submarineand made two depth charge attacks. The submarine, damaged by the depthcharges, subsequently came to the surface at extreme gunnery range and wassunk by United States aircraft.41. H.M.N.Z. Cruiser Gambia commissioned for New Zealand service atthe end of September.42. On the 21st October 5,175 New Zealand Naval personnel were seryingon the New Zealand station and 2,779 overseas.43. The 8th New Zealand Brigade Group landed and occupied TreasuryIsland and the adjoining Sterling Island on the 22nd October. New Zealandcasualties to the 29th October were 18 killed and 65 wounded.44. All Royal New Zealand Air Force Operational Squadrons in the Pacificarea are now being reorganised on the basis of two separate units; a FlyingEchelon to include air crews, Intelligence and operations officers; and aMaintenance Unit consisting of the remainder of the ground personnel.45. The Royal New Zealand Air Force is, in future, to have three fightersquadrons operating from the forward Pacific area in Guadalcanal.46. A Royal New Zealand Air Force Transport Squadron is now operatinga weekly service to various islands with C. 47 aircraft and a mail service withC. 60 aircraft. There is also a bi-weekly service to Norfolk Island.47. The New Zealand Joint Staff Mission in Washington has beenreorganised. The Senior Air Force member of the Mission will also be theR.N.Z.A.F Representative to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, Washington, andwill act as Senior R.N.Z.A.F. Officer in the United States.SOUTH AFRICA.48. The visit of Field-Marshal Smuts to this country has been acclaimedin all South African papers except those of the extreme National group, andthere is much speculation on the purpose of the visit. The sound judgment ofthe Field-Marshal is regarded as invaluable at a time when British, Americanand Russian policy for the future Trans-Atlantic and European framework hasto be planned.
49.   The first session of the new Union Parliament will meet in January..It is expected to last four months owing to the extensive post-war reconstructionprogramme which has been drawn up by the Government for discussion.   TheOpposition newspapers such as Die Burgher have continued to criticise the Prime-Minister for his failure to summon the newly elected Parliament earlier, &quot; at a -time when the country is overwhelmed with problems as the result of neglect onthe part of the Government.&apos;&quot;50. Two secessionist labour groups, Progressive Labour and Independent,Labour, have combined to form the &quot;South African Socialist Party &quot; and thishas struck a serious blow at the Labour Party&apos;s campaign for a united frontagainst capitalism. The new party may be expected to force the Labour Partyinto troublesome intransigence during the forthcoming parliamentary session.51. The Provincial Elections were held on the 13th October. The resultof the Elections was a sweeping victory for the United. Party except in the OrangeFree State. The Afrikaner (Ilavenga) Party took no part in the election. Themain issue for provincial electors was the United Party policy of using the duallanguage medium in Government schools. The Nationalist Party had ralliedfiercely in defence of the Afrikaans single medium schools as the best meansof keeping alive racial divisions in South African politics.52. The food situation in South Africa has led to a renewed outburst ofcriticism of the Governments handling of the problem. Rising costs of living,and the alleged muddle in distribution, have led. to demands for a Ministry ofFood, which would be able to put a ceiling price on commodities. Public opinionis certainly in favour of an equitable rationing system, and critical of the present&apos;&apos; rampant speculation.&quot;53. Four thousand native copper miners who have been on strike in theTransvaal have now returned to work, after 35 of the ringleaders had beenarrested.54.   Mr. Pirow, leader of South Africa&apos;s &quot; New Order &quot; party, has starteda new political organisation called the &quot;Republican Vigilance League.&quot;   Its ;specific purpose is tc destroy the democratic  Parliamentary system which, :according to Mr. Pirow, will be in a state of chaos after the war.   The organisa-tion will not be a political party, but is intended to operate in every constituency,under the leadership of the &quot; New Order &quot; party.55.   The Episcopal Synod of the Province of South Africa, representing .14 Bishops of the Anglican persuasion, issued a statement on the 20th Octobercondemning colour prejudice as cruel, wasteful and dangerous.Naval, Military and Air Activities.56. The call from the British authorities for 270 Union Defence ForceOfficers of suitable medical category and training seems likely to be fully met.These officers will be seconded, will draw the same rates of pay as in the UnionDefence Force and will wear the red shoulder tabs. Very favourable reportshave been received concerning those South Africans who have gone from theUnion and the Middle East to attend courses in England. In addition. SouthAfrica has been able to meet the request from India for certain specialists; sixofficers have been trained at Pretoria as Japanese interpreters, while twelveengineer officers with very special qualifications have also been sent.EIRE.57. In a speech at Glonmel at the beginning of October Mr. de Valera,continuing his crusade for the revival of the Irish language, said that a revivalcould not be brought about by force but only by a popular movement.58. In a speech at Galway on the 4th October the Bishop of Galway saidthat the evils that would arise from emigration were manifold and grievous.&apos;&apos;&quot; What will be the effect on national character,&apos;&apos; he asked, &apos;&apos; when 250,000 ofour people return infected with foreign ideas?&apos; The Government is sincerelyconcerned about national character. How then is it possible that agents couldcome over here recently and arrange for the emigration of 200 young men fromthis district to work in beet factories across the Channel?   That could not be
done were it not permitted and facilitated, and the wages of these men will beIs. Id. per hour. There should be plenty of work for men in this country at thatrate.&quot; This speech is typical of the opposition in Eire to emigration. At the; same time the Eire Government themselves, though their sympathies are probablywith the Bishop, fully realise that, without the war-time emigration to the UnitedKingdom, the unemployment problem in Eire would be very serious They lookforward with some apprehension to a post-war period in which these labourers,accustomed to good conditions in the United Kingdom, return to Eire and lookfor work there.59. Mr. Lemass, the Minister for Supply, speaking in Dublin on the&apos; 12th October, said that the coming year would be the hardest yet. The carryingcapacity of Eire&apos;s ships had been reduced by almost half by the loss of two oftheir best ships, and there would be a growing difficulty in maintaining theessential minimum of internal transport services. The farmers had done well butnot well enough. The country wanted more crops, particularly wheat, if it wasto have a reasonable margin of safety against famine. &quot; The main task now isto stay alive in a world where we have few friends.60. The September 1943 number of The Irish Trade Journal and StatisticalBulletin (an official publication of the Eire Department of Industry andCommerce) contains the official estimate for the Eire Balance of InternationalPayments in 1942. Amongst the figures are the following estimates of emigrants&apos;remittances from the United Kingdom : 1938 ............... 600,0001939 .........      ....      ... 600,0001940 ......      ...      ...      ... 700,0001941 ............... 2,600,0001942................ 6.800.000According to official figures compiled by the Home Office, the number of Eireworkers registered with the Police in Great Britain was 55,151 on the21st September, 1942, and 86,528 on the 4th September, 1943. It may therefore beassumed that the figure of emigrants&apos; remittances from the United Kingdom in1943 will exceed the 1942 figure quoted above.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.61. Viscount Wavell succeeded the Marquess of Linlithgow as Viceroy onthe 20th October. A mild wave of speculation preceded his arrival, and therewas a certain, though limited, degree of expectation that the new Viceroy wouldat once take steps to break the political deadlock by some fresh politicalpronouncement or some act of goodwill such as a general amnesty of theimprisoned and detained followers of the Congress Party. So far as they existedsuch expectations were disappointed. Earlier in the month the&apos; political calmwas ruffled for a brief space by an appeal from Mr. Rajagopalachariar, formerPremier of Madras, that Congress politicians outside prison should abandon theirdependence on those inside and organise national acceptance of the Cripps offer,the rejection of which in 1942 he described as betraying a lamentable lack offoresight. This appeal met with no general response, and the month closedwithout any fresh development in the political situation. Politics and the warsituation were overshadowed by concern over the food shortage (which is referredto below), except in so far as the shortage was made a pretext for political chargesagainst the Government of India and the British Government.62. It is worthy of note that the country&apos;s long period of respite from anyserious communal disturbance still continues and was not broken during recentimportant Moslem and Hindu festivals.63. On the 14th October Lord Linlithgow, in a farewell address to theChamber of Princes, paid a warm tribute to the war effort of the Indian Statesand to their co-operation with British India in attacking the problems of food,cloth and inflation.   The Viceroy reaffirmed his faith in the Federal idea; the
sunity of India, he said, was wholly consistent with the survival and orderlydevelopment of the States; but the Crown&apos;s obligations to protect the Statescarried equally binding responsibilities to ensure that they continued to be worthyof protection; he appealed to the Princely Order to exercise such vigour andforesight, such judicious blending of old and new, such subordination of narrowpersonal and local interests to true patriotism, that the future of India might beensured.External and Frontier Relations.64. Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s Minister reported at the beginning of themonth that the effect of the Italian defeat, making the Axis defeat now morecertain, had increased Afghan fears of Russian intentions. There had beencertain frontier incidents on the River Oxus, but these in themselves were notimportant.65. The members of the German Legation whom the Afghan Governmenthad decided to repatriate arrived in India under safe conduct at the end ofSeptember. But the Counsellor of the Italian Legation, Signor Anzilotti, wasleft behind pending a clarification of the Italian position. His disposal is stillunder consideration.66. His Majesty&apos;s Minister telegraphed on the 1st October a report of along conversations with Signor Quaroni, the Italian Minister, in which the latterhad purported to give a faithful account of Axis activities in Afghanistan. Thereport as a whole adds little or nothing to information already in our hands.The attitude of the Italian Legation is, however, entirely friendly.67. The two interned airmen whom, as reported last month, the AfghanGovernment had agreed to release, left Kabul on the 16th October.68. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has reviewed the situation regarding action bythe Afghan Government to meet His Majesty&apos;s Governments demand for thearrest or expulsion of certain individuals who have been working for the Germansin frontier areas. The conclusion has been reached that the Afghan Govern-ment have gone a reasonable distance to control the tribesmen concerned, andhave also curtailed the funds available for the Axis Legations. In view of thisand of the action taken to reduce the numbers of the German Legation, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have decided not to press the Afghan Government further.69. The Japanese Minister has been recalled to Tokio and has grantedhis English wife a divorce.   She will not be returning to Japan.70. Agreement has been reached on the price to be paid for Afghan wool,for which the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have been negotiatingon behalf of Russia.71. The Afghan Foreign Minister informed Mr. Squire that a Treaty willshortly be signed betwen Afghanistan and China authorising the opening ofLegations and of an Afghan Consulate-General in Sinkiang.72. The well-known archaeologist, Sir Aurel Stein, died of heart failure onthe 26th October while on a visit to Kabul.73. North-West Frontier. The frontier remained generally quiet exceptfor some sniping and inter-tribal raiding between Mahsuds and Wazirs. Withthe return of cooler weather towards the end of the month some collection ofgangs was reported on the borders of Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan.74. Tibet-No further developments have occurred in regard to theconcentration of Chinese troops on the eastern borders of Tibet.Economic.75. Food situation. During the months of September and October therehave been unfavourable developments in the Indian food situation in Bengal.Shortage and high prices in the early part of the year, with growing distress,especially in Calcutta, were countered by despatches of food from other partsof India, mostly wheat. In April, special despatches, to the prejudice of otherdeficit areas, failed to fill the gap and for the next two months the experiment wasmade of free trade over the North-Eastern area, including Bengal, Assam, Bihar
and Orissa. This brought some relief&quot; to Bengal at the cost of higher pricesin surrounding areas, but not sufficient. Nor was the position righted by theharvesting of the autumn crop, of normal dimensions, of which the main partremained in the hands of the cultivator.76. During October famine conditions developed in Calcutta itself, and alsoin some other parts of the Province. In the city the chief sufferers were theprofessional beggar class and destitute persons; in the country districts reliableinformation has been hard to come by, but conditions have certainly been badin the east and south districts of the Province. Anything like complete figuresof deaths from malnutrition are not to be had, but in Calcutta itself 9,448malnutrition cases were admitted to hospital between the 15th August and the15th October, of whom 2,757 died. About twice as many deaths have beenaccounted for. outside the hospitals in Calcutta. Reliable figures elsewherecannot be obtained but an informed guess puts the death-roll at 2,000 a week forBengal as a whole in mid-October.77. Very strenuous efforts have been made to relieve distress by despatchof grain from other parts of India, and. this was coming in during Septemberat the rate of over 3,000 tons a day. The Bengal Government, which is a cabinetof Indian ministers responsible, to the elected legislature of the Province, hasopened and assisted many relief centres in the port of Calcutta and at the end ofthe month decided to move destitute persons out of Calcutta to relief campspreparatory to their ultimate return to their homes. Plans for the rationing ofCalcutta, a city of over two million inhabitants, have been concerned and are tocome into operation by the beginning of December, and statutory control of theprice of rice has been imposed at Rs. 20 per maund (82 lbs.). During the lastfew clays of this month, after a personal visit by the Viceroy, orders have beengiven for help from the army for transport and distribution in the most difficultareas. By co-operation along these lines the provincial and central Governmentshope to get through the critical period between now and the winter rice harvest.This, which should be in the market in January, is reported to be in goodcondition and measures are being taken to purchase as much as possible of iton behalf of Government. .78. Elsewhere in India, though local shortage prevails in more than onepart of; the country, the efforts of the central and provincial Governments havekept famine in check.79. Offers of help in various forms have been received from all theDominions, and supplies of milk foods and vitamins have been despatched urgentlyfrom England. His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able to provide shippingfor substantial imports of food grains from overseas between now and the endof the year and the first shipments have already reached India. The problem* of imports is entirely one of shipping. Operational and other claims throughoutthe world make it exceedingly difficult to find sufficient shipping suitably placed,and. there is no free tonnage which can be switched to such a purpose withoutaffecting other needs of the United Nations&apos; war effort.80. No early and immediate remedy for the condition in Bengal can beexpected, though the promise of a good winter rice crop encourages the hopethat the new year may see the worst of the trouble past. Concentrated as it is inthe corner of India nearest the enemy, the famine is a problem of defence as wellas one of common humanity.81. Control of Cotton Textiles in India. During recent months theGovernment of India have taken effective steps to control the production, pricesand distribution of cotton textiles in India. Until August 1942, cloth priceswere at a reasonable level having regard to increased manufacturing costs.Thereafter, prices rose until in May 1943 they were 150 per cent, higherthan in the previous August. Thereupon Government decided to inter-vene. By prohibiting forward trading in raw cotton and yarn theyremoved purely speculative influences in these markets and effectivelypegged, raw - cotton prices at fair levels. Next, in June they took&quot; stepsto bring out into the open stocks of cloth and yarn, considerable quantities ofwhich had been hoarded, and arranged, with the industry to make 2,000 millionyards of Standard Cloth available at the rate of 150 million yards a month fordistribution among all Provinces and States at a fixed all-India price. Thesemeasures taken together had the effect of bringing down cloth prices by July asmuch as 50 per cent below those of May.[26446] c
f . 82. In continuance of their policy, Government issued in June the Cotton -: Cloth and Yarn (Control) Order, containing several anti-hoarding provisionsand setting up a Textile Control Board, one of whose first actions was to announceceiling prices, ex-mill and retail for some of the most popular mill products.Among these provisions was one requiring the date of packing to be stampedon every bale and fixing a time limit for disposal. Recently the Board, which iscomposed mainly of representatives of the textile industry, has announced, witheffect from the 1st December next, a reduction in the present ceiling prices and theextension of maximum prices to all varieties of cloth and yarn; that all clothand yarn is to be stamped with the ex-mill and retail prices and not to be sold,at higher prices; and that the ceiling prices will be reviewed every three months.This agreement marks a notable advance in the direction of realistic adjustmentof prices and their effective enforcement throughout the whole range of the cottontextile industry&apos;s varied manufactures.83. As a result of these measures and of the large stocks of cloth and yarnbrought to light by the returns called for-under the Control Order, and currentmill production which is now higher than ever, there is good reason for confidencethat supplies of cloth and yarn will hereafter be readily available at controlledand reasonable prices to consumers all over India. With effect from the28th October, Government have allowed forward trading in raw cotton to beresumed on the Bombay market, but not elsewhere, subject to maximum andminimum prices and safeguards to prevent speculation.84.   Effects upon the export market are not yet fully known.85. Shortage of Railway Locomotives. The war has made enormousdemands on the Indian railways, and these have been increasingly intensifiedduring the past 18 months by greatly increased military traffic; the extensiveairfield construction, the ripening development of Indian war industries and thenecessary movement of food and coal. The serious transport problems createdby these heavy demands have been made even more difficult by (a) India&apos;s supply of 206 metre-gauge locomotives from her rolling-stock forMideast and Paic in the earlier stages of the war; and(b) Her inability to obtain replacement of these locomotives, or ordinaryreplacement of worn-out stock, or more than an insignificant part ofher orders for locomotive boilers and spares for maintenance andrepairs. It is almost true to say. that until recently no locomotiveswhatever had gone to India since the outbreak of war.Special efforts have been made to remedy what amounted to a critical situation,and a steady flow of both broad-gauge and metre-gauge locomotives is nowcoming from America. Steady progress is also being made towards overtakingthe large accumulation of outstanding orders for locomotive spares, although theflow of motion parts, steel boiler and firebox plates and copper plates, all urgentlyrequired, continues to be very slow. The progress made with the orders forlocomotive boilers is, unfortunately, almost negligible. The difficulty is lack ofboiler-makers. It has been estimated that, given 200 skilled boiler-makers, thefirms who have the Indian boilers on hand would have no difficulty in copingwith Indian and other requirements. Steps are being taken by the appropriateMinistries to try and secure the return to the locomotive industry of boiler-makersnow engaged on other war work, but up to early October the firms had receivedonly 25 skilled men. The matter is being pursued, and in the meantime effortsare being made, following Sir John Duncanson&apos;s visit to America, to get 200boilers made in the United States and Canada.86. Export of Goods from India. Some doubt has been expressed whether,in view of the strained condition of India&apos;s internal transportation system andthe demands which are being placed upon it in the interests of both India&apos;sinternal economy and military operations, it will be possible to bring to the portsfor shipment the quantities of goods which the United Nations desire to obtainfrom India. With the approval of the War Cabinet the Government of Indiahave now set up a Sub-Committee of their Central Priorities Committee speciallyto deal with this matter. It will be a standing Committee and will submit amonthly report, maintaining a forward view of six months. A representative ofthe Raw Materials Department of the Ministry of Supply will sit on the Sub-Committee, and it is also hoped that representatives of the Ministry of Food andof the United States procurement authorities will also be members of it.    The
Government of India have reported that the Committee&apos;s first impression is thatthere should be no difficulty in bringing to seaboard exports in the desired,quantities. , J; K87. Visit of Railway Experts to India. Jt was decided by the War Cabinet,that two^ experts in railway traffic operation, of whom one might be an American,should visit India informally in order to place their experience and advice at thedisposal of the Government&apos; of India. .Mr. R. J. M. Inglis, of the London andNorth-Eastern Railway, and Colonel Appleton have been selected as the Britishand American experts. The former is now ready to proceed to India, but we areheld up by the delay in the departure of the latter from the United States.88. Coastal Shipping.-r-At the request of the Government of India theMinistry of War Transport have agreed to place additional shipping on theIndian coast sufficient to carry 90,000 tons of coal per month from Calcutta toother Indian ports, thus relieving the Indian railway system of the necessity ofcarrying this quantity of coal by rail. In consideration of this the Governmentof India have agreed to make available for export to the Middle East and Ceylona further quantity of coal which, after some fluctuations, is estimated as likelyto be 28,000 tons per month more than was made available for those destinationsbefore the breaches in the railways leading into Calcutta in July.   .89. Civil Aviation. India was represented at the Empire conversations onpost-war civil air transport in London on the llth-13th October by a delegationheaded by Sir S. Runganadhan, High Commissioner for India. The results ofthe conversations have been communicated to the Government of India.Naval. Military and Air Force Activities.90. Royal Indian Navy. H.M.I. Sloops Goda.va.ri and Kistna. and Cauxery,.which was completed in October, are operating in home waters prior to proceeding&apos;to India.91.   HALLS. Sutlej took part in the operations at Cos.92. During September one motor minesweeper was launched in India, andtwo motor torpedo boats were delivered from the United States.93. Military. Indian State Forces troops have been employed on beachoperations in Italy.94.   Concurrently with the slackening of the monsoon enemy activity inBurma has increased.   There has been considerable infiltration by small bodies ofdhe enemy in the Chin Hills, which had caused some of our levy outposts towithdraw.   The morale of the levies is, however, reported to be satisfactory, andthey are believed to have inflicted considerable casualties.95. Operations in Arakan have been limited to patrol activity. A successfulambush by a patrol of British troops north of Maungdaw resulted in 24 of theenemy being killed.96. In N.E. Burma the Japanese have been active and have forcedChinese forces on the Burma-China border to withdraw. In the Sumprabumarea there has been some patrol activity.97. Air. With marked improvement in weather conditions air activityover the whole area in Burma has increased. The usual reconnaissances, escortsto shipping and anti-submarine patrols were carried out. In addition numerousescorts to convoys proceeding to Chittagong were provided.98. The bombing of enemy communications was increased with good results,the main targets being Taungup, Akyab, Prome and enemy airfields. Enemypositions in Arakan were dive-bombed. Lowr-level fighter attacks were made onenemy camps and rail and river communications, a large number of steamers,barges and other craft, railway engines and trucks, being destroyed or damaged.There were two highly successful attacks on oil refineries at Yathaya.99.   Supply dropping was  on  a higher  scale than  ever before,  over1,000,000 lbs. being dropped.100.   The U.SA.A.F. bombing effort has considerably increased, and heavydamage is claimed to railway targets and bridges all over Burma.[26446] v &quot;&apos;&apos; c 2        &apos;
101. Enemy air activity was limited to reconnaissances, both on the Burmafront and over Calcutta, Chittagong and NAL. Assam. Two flying-boatsdropped a few bombs on Madras, damage and casualties were slight and civilianmorale was unaffected.   A single enemy aircraft was shot down over Ceylon.102. General. Recruiting figures for the Army and Royal Indian Navyin September showed little change. Air Force figures dropped somewhat.Malaria was partly responsible for. keeping the figures down.103. Health. Sick rates have greatly improved and are now satisfactory.This is due to the end of the unhealthy season and to an intensive anti-malariacampaign in the Eastern Army.104. Morale. This remains good, both in India and overseas. As the warrecedes from Persia and Iraq men are realising how long they have been overseas,and requests for an increased scale of leave have grown immensely.105. British troops in India express disgust with strikers in the UnitedKingdom, whose conditions and pay they regard as far better than their own.106. Economic. Widespread sympathy for Bengal among both British andIndian troops has resulted in many units organising relief in kind or in money.107. Prisoners of war. During September over 1,000 Italians weretransferred to Australia for work on the land.108. Indian Production. Owing to operational developments a very urgentdemand for large numbers of supply-dropping parachutes has been received fromG.H.Q., India. The problem is being examined by the Ministries concernedand enquiries are being put on foot in United States. It appears probable, how-ever, that few will be available from sources other than India. Consequently, asany expansion in India&apos;s production as a whole is to be avoided, she may becompelled to increase her output of parachutes at the expense of other militaryproduction if operational needs are to be met.109. Food Supplies. The Director Supplies and Transport G.H.Q., India,is at present visiting the United Kingdom and is discussing with the DirectorSupplies and Transport War Office arrangements for importing, for any addi-tional forces which may be sent to India, food, including reserves, which Indiacannot provide from her own resources in view of the present economic situation.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.110. Occupied Burma. The news of the surrender of Italy is reported tohave given a check to Japanese propaganda designed to prove the impossibilityof a United Nations victory, and the &quot; independence &quot; celebrations held in thelast week of September were used as an opportunity for energetic counter-propa-ganda. Prominence was also given to the recent treaty with Japan terminatingJapanese administration in the Shan and Karenni States and incorporatingthem in Burmese territory. The Japanese wireless does not mention the Shanand Karenni attitude to this treaty and it is apparent that Japanese policy isintended to please the Burmese. Generally speaking the Japanese seem to beexploiting their grant of &quot; independence &quot; to.Burma in a skilful manner andtheir policy shows considerable appreciation of what is likely to appeal to theBurmese.111. Frontier Administration.-An operational boundary between theBritish and Chinese forces in Northern Burma has been under discussion. It isbeing made quite clear that this boundary has no political significance.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Coloniesin the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories, and&apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &apos;&apos; is used to include High Commissioners and the BritishResident, Zanzibar.)
Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.112. Ceylon. Ceylon&apos;s requirements of imported cereals are now acceptedat the figure of 40,000 tons a month, of which 10,000 tons should be rice and30,000 tons flour and wheat from Australia. Shipments of the latter are nowproceeding regularly against the programme. As regards rice, in addition tothe cargo of 9,000 tons of Brazilian rice which is expected to reach Ceylon by thefirst week in December, an allocation of a further 9,000 tons of Egyptian ricehas now been approved for early shipment. This should assure Ceylon&apos;s require-ments of imported rice up to the end of January 1944, and it is hoped that theposition will be met thereafter by the allocation to Ceylon of 50,000 tons out ofthe purchase of the new Egyptian crop which the Ministry of Food hope to effect.113. Special action has been necessary recently to supply Ceylon with milkproducts from Australia, and arrangements are also being made to ship suppliesfrom South America.114. Mauritius. While there is at present an adequate stock of flour inMauritius and no difficulty is foreseen in maintaining its supply, there have beenrecent indications that some unrest may be caused by the monotony of the presentdiet. Unfortunately the local maize crop has been disappointing, and it is noteasy in present circumstances to supply Mauritius with cereals alternative toflour, such as rice, pulses and maize, all of which are in short supply. Arrange-ments are being made, however, to ship a quantity of beans from Madagascar,and it is hoped that a small quantity of Egyptian rice may be made available.East A frica.115. There has been an unfortunate deterioration in the food outlook inEast Africa. A telegram received at the beginning of November stated that theshort rains were overdue and that weather forecasts were unfavourable. Theunfavourable outlook not only means reduced prospects of actual production, butdiscourages producers in surplus areas from marketing their crops. Inconsequence, the East African authorities consider that the import of. over20,000 tons of maize or other cereals will definitely be required by the end ofMarch 1944, and that possibly 50,000 tons in all may be needed before next year&apos;scrop comes in in September 1944. I am asking the supply and shippingauthorities to try and make arrangements to send 20,1300 tons to East Africa byMarch, and the East African authorities have been asked to confirm by telegraphat the earliest possible moment what their total requirements are expected to be.116. A further report is still awaited from the Governor of NorthernRhodesia as to the supplies of maize which he has been able to secure fromneighbouring African territories.Cotton Piece-goods.117. Out of a provisional allocation of cotton piece-goods from the UnitedStates which has recently been made it is hoped to secure 16,500,000 yards for theAfrican Colonies and Ceylon, and 3,000,000 yards for the British WestIndies. These allocations compare with submissions of 30,000,000 yards and8,000,000 yards respectively.&apos;118. Immediate action has been taken by the British Colonies SupplyMission for taking up these allocations, but it is not improbable that difficultiesmay arise over the actual procurement.Sisal.119. Every effort is being made to increase the production of sisal in EastAfrica, but progress has been handicapped by a shortage of labour and the slowdelivery of agricultural and transport equipment from the United States. Thequestion of the compulsory recruitment of labour was recently before the WarCabinet, and it has been decided that continued recourse is necessary to thisexpedient, under stringent safeguards.120. It is hoped that the visit to East Africa of Commander Ort of theUnited States Navy Supplies Department, who is experienced in sisal production,will help to expedite the supply of equipment from the United States.
Pyrethrum.121. To stimulate the production of pyrethrum in East Africa and toincrease the acreage under cultivation, the growers have been guaranteed anassured market for the next four years for the whole crop from existing acreageand for the increased production which may be obtained from any additionalacreage put under cultivation by the end of this year, up to a maximum of50,000 acres in all. For the 1944 crop the price per lb. to growers has beenincreased.Oil seeds and vegetable oils.122. In view of the world shortage of oils and fats, every effort is beingmade, in consultation with the Resident Minister and the Governors of theterritories concerned, to encourage increased production of oil seeds and vegetableoils in West Africa. A scheme has recently been inaugurated for the purchaseof palm oil by the West African Produce Control Board who control, on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government, purchase of all oil seeds and vegetable oils as wellas cocoa in West Africa. Close co-operation in the production and marketing ofthese crops in the French West African Colonies is maintained by the representa-tion of the French National Committee of Liberation on the Board.Oranges from Palestine.123. With the change of military fortune in the Mediterranean, it has againbecome possible to consider the shipment of citrus fruits from Palestine, and theMinistry of Food are in negotiation for the purchase of substantial quantities.The provision of containers, normally imported from Roumania. constitutes achief difficulty, but supplies are being arranged from Portugal.Bauxite in Jamaica.124. Considerable interest has been shown by Canadian and United Statesmanufacturers in the discovery of substantial bauxite deposits in Jamaica, andsome difficulty caused by a demand by the State Department that any &quot; conces-sion&quot; to the Aluminium Company of Canada should be paralleled by equivalentconcessions to the (American) Reynolds Metal Company.125. The situation has been eased by the discovery that Jamaican bauxiterequires special treatment for which large and expensive plant would be required,and that it cannot consequently be made available for the war effort. Thequestion is therefore being considered on a long-term basis, and the possibilityof vesting Jamaican mineral rights in the Crown to facilitate orderly exploitation.Colonial Fisheries.126. Owing to the importance of fish as the chief source of protein in thediet of Colonial populations and the necessity for developing local fisheries tomeet the needs of the Colonies in this respect as far as possible from their ownresources, there has been appointed a Colonial Fisheries Advisory Committee toadvise the Secretary of State on all fishery problems, in association with theFisheries Adviser. The Committee, which includes experts in marine and fresh-water fisheries and fish preservation, held its first meeting on the 20th October. .Report on Individual Colonies. &apos;Palestine.127. There were no special reactions to the course of the war and the maininterest has been in economic affairs, and convictions in the arms trial.128. There has also been a definite increase, in political stirrings among theArabs to counterbalance the Jewish agitation, and local politicians showed arenewed tendency to attempt the formation of some united body of PalestineArab personalities. Impetus was given to this idea by adviee attributed toleading Arabs outside Palestine, notably the Prime Minister of Syria, that it wasimportant to have Palestine Arab representatives taking part in talks on Arabunity. &apos;:129. The conviction of two Jews in the arms trial, mentioned last month,appears to have caused genuine bitterness to the Jewish public, largely becauseof calculated emphasis by the Jewish press on items in the evidence favourable
to the defence. This has lent credence to the allegation that the trial was ananti-Semitic frame-up aimed at discrediting Jewish authorities and the wareffort.130. The most important economic development during October was the intro-duction of the vegetable and fruit marketing scheme in an endeavour to reduceprices. The essentials of the scheme were the fixing of reasonable maximum prices,the concentration of wholesale dealings, in particular in supervised municipalmarkets, and the transport of produce by rail, or road at Government cost for threemonths to four main urban consuming centres. The scheme aroused immediateoutcry from producers and traders, but later many Arab dealers appeared to beco-operating. Jewish producing and marketing organisations were uncompro-misingly hostile and the latter declared that no produce would be sent to marketuntil prices were based on alleged Jewish production costs, or until the schemewas abandoned. Their dictatorial attitude is causing growing irritation amongJewish consumers.131. Although cases of armed banditry continue in rural areas, public-security was generally satisfactory.132.   Arab and Jewish recruiting figures were still low.British Honduras.133. In view of a decision to reduce the number of forestry units fromabroad working in this country, the services of the British Honduras foresters,about 700 in number, who have been working in camps in the north of Scotlandand in the Scottish lowlands will no longer be required.134. The Governor has expressed the hope that as many men as possible willbe placed in war&apos;employment in this country. This question is being activelyconsidered before arrangements are made to repatriate those who do not wish tostay or who cannot be offered employment in connection with the war effort inthis country.Mauritius and Seychelles.135. Sir Cosmo Parkinson, my personal representative, arrived in Mauritiusat the end of September, and after spending three weeks there reached Seychelleson the 26th October.136. My Educational Adviser also spent several weeks in Mauritius andincluded a two days&apos; visit to Seychelles on this way from Mauritius to Mombasa.Fiji.Sugar Dispute.137. The Commission of Enquiry closed its proceedings on the28th September. Farmers belonging to the right wing of the local Union hadappeared in good numbers to give evidence. Soon after, the increase in priceagreed with the Ministry of Food was announced. The movement to cut canehad been growing in some areas, and continued after the announcement: but inthose districts where extremist influence was strongest, growers remained obdurate.The Commission^ findings are that the increase of prices of cane since 1939 has,in fact, kept pace with the aggregate increase in living and production costs.138. The Fiji Executive Council sees no reason to differ from its findingsand I have approved the immediate publication of the Report.
