The deterioration in the German situation has notsince developed with the same speed as it did in 1918, when by the 3rd Octobera new German Government openly requested an Armistice. Indeed, we did notsuggest that the course of events would be exactly parallel. There has neverthe-less been a steady deterioration in Germany&apos;s political, military and economicsituation as a whole, and we see no reason to alter the conclusions reached.(Signed)V.

J.LC. (43) 367.9th September, 1943.PROBABILITIES OF A GERMAN COLLAPSE.Report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.1. In the late summer of 1918 the Allies were studying, as we study to-day,the impact on Germany of great reverses of fortune. The records of that periodshow that the Allied estimate of Germany&apos;s power and will to continue thestruggle was then very wide of the mark. On the 13th August, 1918, Mr. LloydGeorge and General Smuts told the Imperial War Cabinet that they did not thinkwe should be able to force a decision in 1919. On the same day Ludendorff toldthe German High Command that it was no longer possible to force the enemyto sue for peace by offensive action, that the defensive alone could hardly achievethat object, and that the termination of the war would have to be brought aboutby diplomacy.2. A study of the evidence available to the Allies at the time shows thatthey did not lack the material from which to form a correct appreciation. Theyfailed to do so because they attached too much importance to intelligence of apurely military character, and too little to political and economic intelligence,which is necessarily more indefinite.&apos; The experience of 1918 emphasises thedanger of letting the enemy&apos;s apparent military strength blind us to fundamentalweaknesses in his position as a whole.3. A comparative study of the evidence available in 1918 and in 1943 showsmany striking similarities. We set out in an Annex the more important of these.There are, it is true, big differences between the Germany of 1918 and theGermany of 1943, but we do not think that these differences are so fundamental asto invalidate the comparison and the conclusions which flow from it.4. In the late summer of 1918, Germany&apos;s military resources were stillformidable and her Army was still fighting with discipline and determination.As a result of military reverses and the defeat of her U-boat campaign, Germanyand her Allies had lost the initiative and had been thrown on the defensive in alltheatres of war. Germany had passed the peak in production and had virtuallyexhausted her reserves of manpower. On the other hand, the resources of theAllies as a whole, backed by the immense productive capacity of the United States,were increasing rapidly. Accordingly Gerrnany had been forced to abandon anyhope of regaining the initiative and was faced with the prospect of holding outduring the winter only to resume the campaign in the following spring with theodds still more heavily against her. In all these respects the German situation issimilar to-day. .5. It had then, as now, become increasingly difficult to disguise the truestate of affairs from the country as a whole. Thepeople, having lost all faith invictory, were becoming increasingly unwilling to support the strain imposed byfood shortages and mounting casualties. To-day, the food position in Germanyis not so serious, but the heavy casualties, particularly on the Russian Front, andthe shattering effect of Allied air raids have produced a similar, and perhaps evengreater, sense of hopelessness and loss of morale.
6. By the late summer of 1918 all Germany&apos;s Allies had realised that theend was near, and Germany, unable in face of her own difficulties any longer too-ive them adequate military or material support, could not prevent theirdefection as soon as opportunity offered. There is abundant evidence thatGermany&apos;s European Allies take a similar view to-day and that they are againonly waiting the first opportunity to get out of the war.  One has already done so.7. In these circumstances the German High Command in 1918 recognisedthe inevitability of eventual defeat and the futility of continuing the struggle.&quot;We believe that a similar feeling that Germany has lost all hope of winning thewar, and that further fighting can only lead to useless bloodshed and destruction,is prevalent in Germany to-day and that it is shared even by some of the militaryleaders.8. If it were not that the political situation in Germany to-day is verydifferent from that of 1918, we should unhesitatingly predict that Germanywould sue for an armistice before the end of the year. Up till the beginning ofthe last war the German people enjoyed a reasonable degree of liberty of speechand action and, despite war-time restrictions, in 1918 vestiges of independenceand free institutions remained. To-day, the Nazi regime has had ten years inwhich to destroy all trace of democratic ideas and institutions and has duringthis period been training the nation to endure great suffering. Police and partycontrol over all phases of the life of the country is very much more effective thananything that existed in 1918 and has so far proved strong enough to makeimpossible any kind of organised opposition. Moreover, Germany to-day is facedwith the demand for unconditional surrender&apos; to the United Nations, includingRussia, instead of with President Wilson&apos;s comparatively mild 14 points.Finally, the fear of retribution, particularly among the leaders, is this time fargreater.9. Despite these differences, important as they are, we must be preparedfor a situation where further military reverses, the Allied air offensive and thedefection of Germany&apos;s Allies produce even this year a crisis. Those responsiblefor directing the war will themselves cease to believe that any plan which theycan make will avert defeat or even secure a compromise peace; those responsiblefor production and civil administration will recognise that they can no longerdeal effectively with their problems. Awareness of this would quickly spread.In these circumstances the cohesion and resolution of the central Governmentwould be weakened and some change of regime might be brought about to preparethe way for an armistice. The request for an armistice would, in the firstinstance, probably be made either to Great Britain and America or to Russiarather than to the United Nations as a whole. Although there is no generalto-day with the prestige of a Hindenburg or Ludendorff, a group to intervene inthis way might be found from among those generals who are not too deeplycommitted to the Nazi regime, but even they may fail to concert action beforecomplete disintegration has set in. These generals might act in concert withinfluential civilians and use them as a medium for approaching the Allies.10. In assessing the likelihood of such a situation arising, great weightmust again attach to the view taken by Germany&apos;s Allies. As in 1918, theyare probably in a better position than we are to appreciate how near Germany-is to collapse. It is of the greatest significance that at the present timeGermany&apos;s European Allies, without exception, are convinced that her defeat isinevitable and not far distant; so much so that those that remain are allanxiously exploring possibilities of deserting the sinking ship. There is equallygood evidence that Japanese observers in Europe regard Germany&apos;s position withgrave apprehension. Finally, the European Neutrals, who should also be in agood position to judge, are convinced that Germany has lost the war and mostof them are adjusting their policy accordingly.11. A study of the picture as a wdiole leads us inevitably to the conclusionthat Germany is if anything, in&apos;a worse position to-day than she was at thesame period in 1918. Once again, if military factors alone were taken intoaccount, our appreciation would be that the German army, despite decliningmorale and fighting efficiency, would be able to fight on for a considerable time.But the war will not be decided purely by military factors. The end will comewhen we have broken Germany&apos;s will to continue the struggle. In this thedemoralisation of the home front, economic difficulties and the political shockof the defection of her Allies will play their part no less surely than the defeat[26219] B 2
of Germany&apos;s armies in the field. If, therefore, the Allies can take advantageof Germany&apos;s declining strength and press home attacks by land and sea,maintain and even intensify their air offensive, exploit the instability of South-East Europe, and pursue a vigorous political propaganda campaign, we may seethe defection of the rest of Germany&apos;s European Allies and we may, even beforethe end of this year, convince the German people and military leaders that a con-tinuation of the war is more to be feared than the consequences of inevitabledefeat. With the German people no longer willing to endure useless bloodshed anddestruction, and the military leaders convinced of the futility of resistance,there might be, as in Italy, some sudden change of regime to prepare the wayfor a request for an armistice.(Signed) V.

VICKERS.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,9th September, 1943.ANNEX.Similarities between Germany&apos;s Situation in August 1918 and August 1943.The account of Germany&apos;s situation in August 1918, given below, is largelydrawn from a Foreign Office confidential memorandum^ entitled : &quot; Indicationsof the German Collapse in 1918.&quot;I. German Military Situation.Land situation.1918 2. Germany&apos;s offensive in France in 1918 was designed to strike adecisive blow at the British and French armies before the arrival ofAmerican forces in sufficient numbers to turn the scale in favour of theAllies. This offensive, which at one time seemed to be on the point of success,failed and Germany and her Allies were thrown on the defensive in alltheatres of war by the Allied counter-offensive. It was at this point, i.e.,the 8th August, 1918, that the Kaiser &apos;: first knew that the war could nolonger be won,&quot; and Flindenburg, in Aus Meinem Leben, wrote : &quot;I had nodoubt about the political effects of our defeat of the 8th August. The strugglewhich took place between the 15th July and 4th August, 1918, might wellbe regarded both abroad and at home, as a bold enterprise which met withmisfortune as happens in every war; the disaster of the 8th August wasquite evidently the consequences of weakness which could not be concealed.It was quite another matter to be beaten in a battle in which we stood on thedefensive than to fail in an attack. The captures which the enemies wereable to display to the world spoke for themselves.&quot; It is true that from thepurely military point of view Germany might have been able to wage a purelydefensive war for longer than she did., but her power of military offensivehad spent itself in the operations of the Spring and early Summer of 1918,and her lack of reserves and manpower and her inferiority in munitions(especially tanks), coupled with the constant arrival of United States rein-forcements, made her eventual military defeat merely a matter of time.1943 3. In the present war, Germany&apos;s strategy was decisively to defeatthe Russian armies before Great Britain and America had. time to build uptheir resources to open land operations in Europe. Germany&apos;s all-outoffensive against Russia failed in the Autumn of 1942, and Germany nowfinds herself fighting unsuccessfully on the defensive in all theatres of war.* No. 16284 dated 20th November, 1942.
In Russia the German Army has been driven back on a front of 600 milesfrom strongly fortified positions and the Russian offensive still continues:Meanwhile Anglo-American forces, after throwing the Germans out ofNorth Africa, are invading Europe itself.Again, if military factors alone are considered, Germany may appearable to wage a defensive war for a considerable time, the more so becausethe Allies are still a long way from the frontiers of Germany. Her powerof strategic offensive, however, has spent itself and it is clear that the retreatsare the consequence of weaknesses which can no longer be concealed and thather eventual military defeat is merely a matter of time.Naval Situation.1918 4. By 1918 the German U-boat campaign had failed, although the Allieshad not succeeded substantially in reducing the number of U-boats operating.Germany had failed in her campaign of starving Great Britain and ofpreventing the transport of American troops and material. The morale ofU-boat crews had deteriorated to a point where it could no longer be ignoredby the German Naval Command.1943 5. The U-boat campaign has again failed both in its primary purpose ofwinning the war outright by starving Great Britain, and in its secondarypurpose of preventing the movement of Allied troops and war material.Moreover, the Allies have demonstrated their ability to sink U-boats fasterthan they are produced. The morale of the U-boat crews is declining, andthey are increasingly reluctant to face any save unprotected targets.A ir Situation.1918 6. By the late summer of 1918 the Allies had gained complete airsuperiority. German aircraft production could no longer keep pace, and themorale and fighting efficiency of the crews were suffering in consequence.1943 7. To-day Germany has again lost air superiority, and is even moreeffectively outmatched than she was in 1918 in a sphere which has become ofparamount importance. There is abundant evidence of serious anxietyr onthe part of the German Air Command over the lack of determination andloss of morale of the crews.II. German War Production.1918 8. War production was declining both in quantity and in quality owingto the shortages of raw materials and labour, but the overall reduction wasonly about 10 per cent, below the peak. While reduction in quality wasnoticeable at the front, German operations were not seriously affected by anydiscernible shortages of munitions, though they were handicapped by theinferiority in tanks. The production of the Allies, on the other hand, wasconstantly increasing.1943 9. Germany&apos;s production of war material, which has now to contendwith constant air bombing in addition to shortages of raw materials andlabour, has declined from its peak by at least as much as in 1918. There havebeen frequent local and temporary shortages of various munitions at thefronts. Futhermore, there is an overall shortage of oil, tanks and M.T.The production of the Allies, on the other hand, is rapidly increasing, and islikely to continue to clo so.III. Internal Conditions in Germany.1918 10. By August 1918, the falsity of the communiques of the GermanHigh Command had been exposed and gave, rise to acute disillusionment.The failure of the German offensive, the mounting casualties, and therealisation that the U-boat campaign could no longer be counted on to preventAmerican resources in men and material from playing their full part beforeGreat Britain and France could be defeated, had brought the German peopleto realisation of the fact that the war could not be won. This change ofattitude was all the more far-reaching, since it followed a blind faith in theGerman Army and confidence in victory which had been fostered bypropaganda.
At the same time the German people were becoming increasinglyunwilling to support the strain of conditions of life under the blockade andthey looked forward with dread to another winter of war. This discontentof the German masses, in spite of strong control by the Government, itselfunder military dominance, was beginning to manifest itself in grumbling,open criticism and strikes.Further, conditions at the Front were becoming known at home andconditions at home were causing increasing anxiety and lowering of moraleof troops in the Field.1943      11.   There is evidence that to-day the official German communiques areno longer believed.The failure of Hitler to achieve decisive victory against Russia beforethe strength of the British and American armies could begin to make itselffelt, the mounting casualties and the failure of the U-boat campaign toprevent American resources in men and material from being transportedacross the Atlantic, have once again brought realisation to the German peoplethat the war cannot be won. German propaganda, with its boastful and falsepromises of victory, has lost its power and acute disillusionment has set in.The Allied blockade has not been so effective in bringing about adeterioration in Germany&apos;s food position, but the results of Allied airbombardment are immeasurably greater than they were in 1918, so that con-ditions of life in bombed areas and some evacuation areas are to-day far worsethan they were in 1918. Discontent of the German people, in spite of a farmore ruthless control to-day, is beginning to show itself in open expressionsof criticism which would have been unthinkable a year ago, and there isevidence of strikes and rioting, as yet only local and on a small scale, butwhich are all the more significant in face of the drastic penalties attached tothem.There is evidence that the German Authorities have been unable todisguise the conditions at home from the troops and that conditions on theRussian Front are equally well-knowm in Germany. Indeed, so well recog-nised is this that German home propaganda has had to change its policy andendeavour to sustain morale by stressing the hardships which the troops aresuffering, while captured letters show that German censorship has been unableto prevent conditions at home from becoming known at the front. Capturedletters of troops at the front show once again their anxiety about conditionsin Germany and the effect on their morale.IV. Germany&apos;s Relations with her Allies.918 12. Germany was the predominant member of the Central Powers andwas largely responsible not only for the military strategy of her partnersbut also for their general policy. After 1917 it was clear that the CentralPowers were held together only by the hopes of a German victory. ButGermany displayed a growing inability to sustain her Allies, and although inAugust 1918 they were still outwardly loyal to her, yet by the end ofSeptember, Austria-Hungary had issued a Peace Manifesto, Turkey had suedfor peace and Bulgaria had signed an armistice. We show in an Ajopendixthe sequence of events from July 1918 to the Armistice with Germany.4943 13. The situation, to-day is similar to that in August 1918. Germany,the predominant partner, is again unable to sustain her Allies and herrelations with them are in every case deteriorating. Italy has withdrawnfrom the war and Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria and Finland have shownsigns of wanting to do the same. Some have already been emboldened to takemore positive steps in this direction.
