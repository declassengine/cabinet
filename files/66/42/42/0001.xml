PRELIMINARY1 The facts which came to light during the recent trial at Maidstone-Assizes of two warrant officers for the manslaughter of Rifleman Clayton&apos;atport Darland Detention Barracks profoundly shocked the public. Aconsiderable section of the Press was for a time filled with articles, letters,and comments, many of which suggested that this was not an isolatedoccurrence but that brutality and.so-called Gestapo methods were the ruleand not the exception at military places of detention throughout the country.The suspicion that such- might be the case was both natural and alarming.In these circumstances, this Committee was appointed by the Prime Ministerto make a thorough enquiry into the administration of places of detentionwith a view to ascertaining as far as possible where the truth lay.2.   The Terms of Reference were:&quot; To enquire into and report on the treatment of men under sentencein Naval and Military Prisons and Detention Barracks in the UnitedKingdom and whether it is in accordance with modern standards andsatisfies wartime requirements. The investigation will cover inter aliathe supervision and administration of discipline, medical care, training,welfare, accommodation, feeding, and the suitability and adequacy of thestaff.&quot;&apos;6. The Committee was originally constituted with Lord Moran as amember. Early in August however it became necessary for him to travel tothe American continent. The task of the Committee being long and urgent,it was considered imperative that at all events a start should be made. TheChairman and the Bishop of Reading agreed that nothing practical could bedone without skilled medical assistance. The Prime Minister from Canadaapproved Dr. H. E. A. Boldero, Poegistrar of the Eoyal College of Physiciansand Dean of the Middlesex Hospital, to act as a substitute for the time being,in the hope that Lord Moran would return sufficiently soon to join in theenquiry. This however proved impossible and the whole investigation wasover before Lord Moran&apos;s return. Dr. H. E. A. Boldero, having done thewhole of the work as a member of the Committee, was formally appointedby the Prime Minister to replace Lord Moran.4. The Committee desire to put on record at the earliest possible momentthat, after an investigation extending over five whole weeks, the nature ofwhich will be set out in this Report, they are satisfied that at present at anyrate and for some time past no brutality of the sort indicated is being or hasbeen practised. They are less satisfied about the conditions prevailing in theearly days of the war. The Committee are not saying that the system and itsadministration are, in their opinion, perfect. On the contrary, there are anumber of matters which they think could and should be remedied in waysthat they will indicate, but the main matter of public concern, viz. calculatedbrutality to men in detention, does not in their opinion exist.5. It may be convenient at this point to offer a few observations on thegeneral nature and object of punishment by detention, and to note that, asapplied to the Services, while the word &quot; detention &quot; carries less stigma thanthe word &quot; imprisonment,&quot; the treatment of persons sentenced to imprison-&quot;lent and detention is in the main the same, the only difference being thatsome of the places of detention are in their environment more unpleasantMan others. All legislation to be effective must be backed by what juristscall a sanction, that is to say, power to prescribe and inflict a penalty of somesort on the disobedient. Such sanctions in the case of civilians, except inextreme cases, take the form of fine or imprisonment. Good citizens wouldenave without such sanctions, but bad ones would not and there are and[26240] 0*
always will be a small minority who break the law in spite of the penalties&quot;prescribed but who nevertheless must be restrained for the protection ofsociety. A member of the Fighting Forces undertakes additional liabilities-the deprivation of a considerable part of his personal liberty, the obligation ofobedience to lawful commands and the whole catalogue of duties summarisedin the word &quot; discipline.&quot; Without discipline the Fighting Services wouldperish. In wartime the country would perish with them. Here again goodService men seldom offend. Such small transgressions as they commit canbe and are dealt with domestically in their units, but unfortunately there is aproportion, large in number though very small when considered as a percent-age of the whole, who have to be punished in such places as Naval andMilitary Prisons and Detention Barracks for offences such as desertion orlong and/or continuous absence without leave, for disobedience, for violencetowards their superior officers, and a host of other matters. The best of theseare men who have transgressed more or less accidentally or because of somefamily trouble or other pressure. The worst of them are men who show bytheir conduct that they are quite determined not to serve in any event, butwould rather spend their lives till the end of the war in detention or prison.They may be referred to as recidivists.6.   In these circumstances several considerations present themselves asreasonable:(a) Places of detention must not offer greater but less attractions thanservice with the unit. Conditions must therefore be strict andwork and discipline hard. Complete loss of liberty is probably thestrongest deterrent but additional penalties have to be providedto deal with those who refuse to conform to the discipline, of theplaces themselves.- These take the form of dietary punishments,loss of privileges, loss of remission, and the like.(b) In the case of all but the recidivists the object of these places shouldbe rehabilitation, the training of a good sailor, soldier or airman, inplace of a bad one, the building up of self-respect by discipline ofthe right sort.(&quot;b) In the ease of the recidivist it is probably hof)eless to try to converthim to better ways but at the same time, while he is unlikely everto be of any use to his country in any capacity, if cannot beallowed to go forth that a man whose services have been demandedby his country can secure for himself exemption, while othersserve, merely by refusing to perform them. This would only temptwaverers to follow suit.(J) And perhaps the most important. The strictest justice must bemeted out to all in detention. Nothing in the nature of ill-treatmentor injustice is to be tolerated. The discipline must be firm buthumane.PART IYisits of the Committee to Military Prison and DetentionBarracks and Naval Detention Quarters7. After very careful consideration the Committee came to the conclusionthat the best way to begin their task was to visit personally each * MilitaryThe two small institutions in the Orkneys and Shetlands, housing respectivelyabout fifteen and six detainees, were not visited as it was felt that the time andexpense involved would not be justified. Owing to an unfortunate misuiuler-standing for which the Committee feel themselves to blame Carrickfergus Barracksin Northern Ireland were not visited, as when they were in that neighbourhood(Glasgow) the Committee were under the impression that these barracks were not jused for United Kingdom detainees.
Prison and Detention Barracks (M.P. and D.B.), and in the case of the Navythe Naval Detention Quarters (N.D.Q.), and make investigations on the spotAfter these inspections it was decided to hear relevant statements andcomplaints from those who wished to make them at The Royal Courts ofjustice, London. Starting with the M.P. and D.B. and N.D.Q. presented thegreat advantage that the Committee would familiarise themselves by personalobservation with the working of the various institutions and the system as awhole. The Committee further felt that while the past is beyond recall theconditions of the present are vital. The public anxiety in this matter, ofcourse, would most acutely affect parents, relations, and friends of the mennow under detention. Nevertheless the Committee have also felt bound toinvestigate, so far as they were able, allegations relating to the past as beingobviously germane to the purpose of the enquiry as a whole.I&apos;    8.   This Report will therefore first, in Part I, review the conditions whichPthe Committee believe now exist; and secondly, in Part II, will deal withevidence of abuses which may have existed since this war began and whichdepend almost entirely on statements made during the hearings in London.9. The Committee desire in this Report to emphasise that they are notin a position to find that specific allegations of brutality are true. Beforethis could be done the persons accused, often not available, would have to beheard in their defence. Furthermore, inasmuch as physical brutality to menunder sentence is not only a gross breach of discipline but also a criminaloffence, the Committee could not hold any such offences proved vvithoutdoing the gravest injustice to persons who would in law, before beingconvicted, be entitled to trial by jury or court-martial. On the other hand,where the Committee are of opinion that such charges are obviously falseor quite unreliable they have felt it their duty to say so. Finally on thistopic the Committee have for reasons which should be obvious, refrained frommentioning the names of individuals whether they are accusers or accused.10. In approaching their local investigations the Committee consideredthat three matters were of great inrportance for the purpose of obtaining atrue insight into prevailing conditions: First, that their visits must beunannounced and unexpected. Secondly, realising as they did the reluctanceof men under restraint to make complaints to the knowledge of their superiors,the Committee yet felt that every man at each of the institutions visitedshould at least have the opportunity to complain to them if he desired.Thirdly, still bearing in mind the reluctance last referred to, the Committeefelt that they should devise some additional method to supplement that ofinviting complaints on a parade ground.11. In order to give facilities for unexpected and unannounced visits,and to save time, an aeroplane was provided for the long journeys and cars forlocal transport. The first week&apos;s work was spent visiting the institutionswithin reach of London. These were: Colchester D.B., Fort Darland D.B.,Canterbury N.D.Q., Aldershot M.P. and D.B. and Portsmouth N.D.Q. No onebut the Committee themselves knew beforehand where they were going, andit was often not decided until they actually got into the car. At the requestof the Committee passes had been provided in advance which enabled themto enter at once any institution on arriving at its gates. The second weekwas similarly spent, using Manchester as a base and inspecting Stake Hillu.B Sowerby Bridge D.B., Chorley D.B. and Preston N.D.Q.- The thirdveek was occupied, using Glasgow as a base, inspecting (on the way North)jNomiaherton M.P. and D.B., and on arrival at Glasgow, Riddrie M.P. and&apos; Coatdyke N.D.Q., and Mossbank D.B.[26240] c* 9
12. Of the four Naval Detention Quarters, Portsmouth, Canterbury andPreston are adapted civil prisons, and Coatdyke is a converted Territorialdrill hall and outbuildings surrounded by barbed wire. Of the nine militaryinstitutions three are prisons, viz. Aldershot, built originally as a militaryprison and commonly called &quot;The Glasshouse,&quot; and Riddrie and North-alierton which are disused civil prisons. The remainder Colchester, &quot;FortDarland, Stake Hill, Sowerby Bridge, Ohorley, and Mossbank-are citherhutted camps or converted nulls and in one case an industrial school, withmore or less spacious grounds surrounded by barbed wire. The comparativelyfew RAF. detainees are provided for at the military establishments. Somenaval ratings and marines are at Fort Darland. Out of upwards of 5,200occupants seen by the Committee about 750 were naval ratings and marines,only about 300 were E.A.F. personnel and the rest were soldiers. Speakingbroadly, until very recently the Navy and the R.A.F. have, had the first pickof recruits, the Army receiving the rest. The Committee consider it a verystriking fact that the higher the standard of education the lower the percent-age of men under Service punishment. We were given to understandthat the number of soldiers was roughly three times the number of airmen,yet the number of soldiers in detention was roughly fifteen times as greatas the number of airmen.13. The Committee adopted the following procedure: On first arrivalthey interviewed the Commandant and called for nominal rolls of all the menin detention and then from each section they picked at random certainnames, taking cure to select mainly men who bad been in the place for aconsiderable time. The men thus selected were brought to rooms for a privateinterview with the members of the Committee. As it was considered thai theywould be less embarrassed and more likely to speak freely to one person thanto three, the selected men were interviewed alone by one or other of theCommittee. At the start of each interview the man was asked to sit clownand was told who we were, that we had no connection with the Services,and that we would promise absolute confidence as to what was said to us, inthe sense that no one would ever be told the name of the man in connectionwith what he said to us, and it was further pointed out that inasmuch as itwas we who had asked to see him and not he who had asked to see usno one could ever suspect that he would be complaining at all. The manwas then questioned closely as to whether he had ever suffered any ill-treatment or any injustice or had seen any inflicted on any other man. Whatthe man said was then written down and the result of these interviews issummarised beiow (cf. para. 14). The Committee could think of no betterway of getting at the truth .as to the general treatment of the men in thevarious institutions, and none has been suggested by the various witnesses,whom we later saw in London. These included four Members of Parliament,who were good enough to give up their time to assist the Committee.14. In this manner the Committee separately interviewed 211 men.Every single man, in answer to direct questions, stated that he bad nevereither suffered or witnessed violence or ill-treatment at the institution inwhich he then was. Two of them said they had seen acts of violence sometime ago in other places where they had been in detention before. One ofthese said he had seen a man struck in April 1942, and named twono longer in the Service. The other, who volunteered that he had beensentenced to eighteen months&apos; imprisonment at the Old Bailey a few yearsago (which could hardly have been bis only conviction), said that at adetention barracks where he had been before,&apos; be bad seen an N.C.O. strikean airman who had upset a bucket over him. Twelve complained in variousterms that there was too much shouting and &quot; chasing &quot; and bad language
219by the Staff. One said that he had actually been threatened with violence,but he was a man whom the Committee disbelieved for reasons given in-Appendix A, No. 65. One man of a somewhat unusual type complained thathe had been searched on insufficient grounds under suspicion of having stolensome cigarettes. They were not found on him, but he admitted quite naivelythat he had in fact stolen them. Twenty-three complained of the food, asthe Committee thought without justification. The Committee doubt if anysystem of institutional feeding receives the approval of everyone to whomit is administered. Twelve complained, and the Committee think with reason,of some of the sanitary conditions. Three complained of the severity of thediscipline.   Six naval men complained of the absence of bedding (c/. para. 17).15    Apart from the above there were no complaints at all and a quitegetting into trouble meant, &quot; You get reported and punished by theCommandant.&quot;16. Before and if necessary after these interviews the Committee care-fully inspected the food; the medical accommodation; the sleeping, washingand sanitary arrangements; the chapel; the lecture rooms; the informationroom; the technical training room; the punishment cells; the parade andexercise grounds and, in fact, the whole premises. In the course of theirinspections the Committee observed two matters in particular. First, thatconditions in the military prisons are far less pleasant for their occupantsthan in the detention barracks. The men in the prisons live mainly inseparate cells and are surrounded by prison walls. Although in some of thecells three men are accommodated and for three periods of twenty minutesin each day all are allowed to meet and communicate with each other,confinement is largely solitary. The detention barracks, on the other hand,are places in rural surroundings with no encircling wall. There are, of course,barbed wire barrages for security reasons. The men sleep in large dormitorieshousing from twenty to seventy in each where they can freely converseprovided thai; reasonable order is maintained. They have far larger andmore pleasant exercise grounds and life is altogether more tolerable. TheCon i in it-tee were assured and believe that the prisons are kept for bad casesof the recidivist type. They consider it most important that this distinctionshould be strictly maintained. It is true that recidivist cases are also dealtwith in the barracks because the prisons will not hold them all, but the regula-tion is that they are kept in rooms separated from the better type of detaineeand the young soldiers.17. The second matter for observation was that at three of the fourNaval Detention Quarters the discipline and general life of offenders are inmany respects far harder even than in the military prisons. For instance,each man is housed in a separate cell. He has during his term of sentenceno communication with his fellows at all. They exercise and drill togetherand that is all. Moreover, until he has earned 112 good conduct marks thenaval offender has to lie at night on bare boards without blankets, thoughin cold weather this latter is mitigated. As it takes fourteen days to earn112 marks, if the maximum is earned, this is in itself a somewhat drasticpunishment. Again, the naval offender is not allowed to write or receive aletter for a similar time and then only one until he has earned another. Thisrule also may be relaxed by the Captain on compassionate grounds. As hasbeen pointed out above, even in the military prisons an hour&apos;s communication11 day is permitted, men are given bedding from the start, they are allowed
to receive at once as many letters as are written to them and to write a letteronce a week. Some of the above observations as to N.D.Q. do not apply toCoatdyke where the building is not a prison and the men are associated inrooms&quot;. They get a wire bed and blankets from the start. Such naval ratingsand marines as are sent to Fort Darland are treated in the same way as themilitary detainees.18. The Committee consider it an astonishing fact that in spite of thecomparative harshness of the Naval Detention Quarters there has been nopublic outcry at all against them; whereas there has been a very violent oneagainst the military institutions. This may be to some extent accountedfor by the very hardness of some of the conditions of Naval sea service, butthe fact remains that the Committee have not heard a suggestion of violenceor brutal treatment against the N.D.Q. Staff and not a witness has appliedto be heard by them in London in relation thereto. Many witnesses, on theother band, have come forward to make such allegations against the militaryprisons and barracks. The truth may be that the exposure of a scandal likethe Clayton case and the public indignation justly aroused by it have unitedto stimulate the imagination of some i^ersons of the exhibitionist type, andto cause others to exaggerate their impressions and in- some cases to telldownright lies.   (c/. Appendix, Group 2.)19. In the afternoon of each visit, at the request of the Committee, everyman in the place was paraded. They were then addressed in the presenceof the Committee, care being taken that every man could hear, as follows:-&quot; This Establishment is being visited to-day by the Committeeappointed by the Prime Minister to enquire into the conditions prevailingin detention barracks. Any man having any complaint of ill-treatmentor injustice here may make it now to the Committee who will bear it inprivate.   No man so complaining need fear any victimisation.&quot;Such men as complained, ninety-one in all out of the 5,200, were I ben heardby the Committee sitting together. The vast majority came, as the Com-mandants frequently warned us they would come, from men of the recidivisttype who are, as might be expected, the trouble-makers at these places. Some&quot; complaints &quot; were not complaints at all. Many were trivial. Many morewere, in the opinion of the Committee, quite unjustified.    [i20. On the totality of the evidence gained from the above sources alone,the Committee were satisfied that there is not now nor has there been forsome time past any violence or physical ill-treatment practised upon men indetention. But further, this conclusion received striking confirmation fromsome of the witnesses who appeared before the Committee in London.No less than five conscientious objectoi-s who had been, at various timesbetween November 1942, and July 1943, detained at Chorley, Fort Darland,Sovverby Bridge and Biddrie, said that they bad never experienced nor seenany violence towards prisoners on the part of the Staff anywhere. One ofthem said he had been struck on the back by a medical officer at Biddrie tocall attention to the fact that he was speaking to him. The Committee didnot take this seriously.21. The force of this testimony is threefold. In the first place, thesewere all men of good character, education and intelligence. In the secondplace, it is in the nature of things that a conscientious objector is fearlessabout expressing his opinions, and therefore would not hesitate to make a
complaint: Finally, it would be difficult to imagine a type of man morecalculated to arouse the fury of a brutal N.C.O. than a conscientious objectorwho refuses to obey orders and sometimes even to dress. In yiew of thesuggestion that has sometimes been made that Fort Darland was onlyreformed by the Clayton scandal, it is right to point out that of these fivemen two were at Fort Darland, one before and the other at the time of01ayton&apos;s death.With regard to shouting, &quot; chasing&quot; and bad language, the Committeefeel sure that a certain amount of this does go on. In any body of men inauthority, such as N.C.Os., amounting to many hundreds as is the case withthe Staff under consideration, a few bullies will almost inevitably be found.Staff22. The Committee consider that there are not enough commissionedofficers at these places and that there ought to be enough to ensure that allexercises of the men together should be under the direct supervision of acommissioned officer; and, furthermore, that at frequent and irregularintervals and unannounced commissioned officers should go through thequarters themselves. Not one complainant or witness who made statementsto the Committee has suggested that&apos; any kind of bullying ever took place inthe presence of a commissioned officer. A good many have said that theyhardly ever saw one. The regimental sergeant-majors at the Militaryinstitutions and the warrant masters at arms at the Naval Quarters were,from our observation, quite admirable people who knew their work and did itthoroughly and sympathetically; but the staff below them varied a good dealin quality and were not sufficient in number. Some of them were past thework. Others were insufficiently trained and some were constitutionallyunfitted for the task. To be a really efficient warder of people in confinementa man needs many qualities, including besides firmness and technicalknowledge and military skill, tact and, above all, patience. It should not beforgotten that many men in detention are most difficult, unwilling, insubor-dinate and insolent. A few are dangerous. The Committee have noted thefact that whereas in civil prisons corporal punishment may be inflicted uponoffenders who seriously assault their warders no such punishment is permittedeither in Military or in Naval detention institutions. They have also notedthat the Departmental Committee which shortly before the war advised theabolition of corporal punishment for all civil offences, expressly exceptedfrom its recommendations the case of serious assaults on warders in civilprisons and advised that for such acts corporal punishment should be retained.The position disclosed seems anomalous having regard to the fact that underconscription the Services necessarily include some men of criminal type andantecedents who would not have been recruited in times of peace.23. The whole problem of securing really efficient and trained Staff forthese places is beset with the greatest difficulties in these days of shortage ofmanpower and especially of efficient manpower. The qualities of a capablewarder referred to above are the very qualities of an efficient N.C.O. with acombatant unit, and for obvious reasons such men should not be advanced inyears. It is further apparent that they should be volunteers. It would notbe easy to believe that a man who was compelled to take the position of awarder against his wish would make a good one.24. The present method of training men for the Military Provost Staffj.orPs (M.P.S.C.), is to send them for a few weeks to Aklershot and then todistribute them as required.   The Committee consider that some central
school should be established forthwith, probably located at one of the existingestablishments other than a military prison, where a thorough training couldbe given for not less than two months, and that such men should not be passedout to serve unless they attain a definite standard of efficiency. The Com-mittee have it in mind that even after the war is ended it may be necessaryto keep a large Army mobilised for an unknown period. The ideal &quot; warder,&apos;&quot;&apos;of course, would be a man who, in addition to his training as a warder, isskilled to give instruction in arms and military training, yet a man might be agood warder without that special knowledge. As the combination of qualitiesrequired makes it very difficult to obtain sufficient good M.P.S.C. Staff, theCommittee consider that the question of relieving the M.P.S.C. of instruc-tiorial duties should be fully explored. Special instructors would then beattached for duties, in the same way as Physical Training Instructors now are.Medical Care25. The Committee were on the whole very favourably impressed withthe medical arrangements which they found existing at the present time.26. The accommodation and facilities available for the medical officerwere in most places good; in one or two they were better than this, while ina few they fell short of the desirable standard. In the last group the deficiencylay in the absence of a room or rooms that could be used for looking after menWho require to be kept in bed for a few days only. It is undesirable thatsuch cases should be cared for in their usual sleeping accommodation,particularly wdien that is a barrack room. Nor is a neighbouring hospitalthe ideal solution.27. At each of the Military Prisons and Detention Barracks and NavalDetention Quarters, the Commanding Officer expressed himself as satisfiedwith his Medical Officer. At some of the places whei&apos;e only a part-timeMedical Officer is appointed there was some apprehension that he would notquickly be available in an emergency. In practice no instance of such anoccurrence was reported as having arisen in recent times. But the possibilityis obvious. It is desirable that a whole-time Medical Officer should beappointed to each Detention Barracks. However, the shortage of medicalmen is known; moreover the most important aspect of these appointments isthat the man should have a particular aptitude for this rather specialised anddifficult type of work.28. On their visits to the various Detention Barracks the Committeereceived a considerable number of complaints against Medical Officers. Oninvestigation all of these could be attributed to the nian&apos;s desire to be excusedthe harder parts of his routine or to the fact that time spent sick or inhospital counts as part of the sentence. This is a real difficulty for theMedical Officer and where such exists there must always be a chance of amistake. The onus on Medical Officers would be lightened if clays spentcomfortably in hospital did not count towards the completion of the sentence.29. The present Medical Officers seemed to the Committee to be wellsuited to their work and to be rendering good service. However, it is properfor the Committee to make the criticism that in some instances far toofrequent changes of Medical Officers have occurred. It is hoped that thispractice will not be repeated; nevertheless it would not be right to keep ayoung man at this work year after year.30. With regard to sanitation and hygiene the Committee were verymuch dissatisfied with some of the sanitary arrangements at the majorityof the Military institutions they visited.   To start with the Barracks, in these
the men are shut up in their rooms at some fairly early hour; half-past six intue evening was the latest we heard of and four-five o &quot;clock the average.From then till the following morning between six and seven o&apos;clock themen are locked into their rooms. The only sanitary arrangements in therooms consist of buckets, and sometimes only - one, sometimes two, closetseats. These are in many cases in the sleeping rooms themselves withoutany flushing arrangements and in some cases not even screened from therooms. The result needs no elaboration and, in the opinion of the Committee,forms a real hardship for the men who have to endure it. The Committeefeel strongly that immediate steps should be taken to provide proper water-closets, not in the rooms themselves but outside the rooms and with theirown ventilation. At Fort Darland the Committee understand this is alreadybeing done. At Colchester, Stake Hill, Sowerby Bridge and Chorley theconditions.need immediate attention. In this matter the Committee havethe support of the Adjutant-General and of all the Commandants concerned.31. It is realised that separate night water-closets cannot be providedfor the cells of Prison Establishments. The Committee therefore recommendthat in these places additional latrine parades, including one just before&quot;Lights out &quot; should be arranged. The attention of the Committee wasfrequently drawn to the inadequacy of the time allowed for latrine paradesand they recommend that additional time be allotted.Training and Welfare32. If the purpose of detention as a method of rehabilitation as well asof punishment is borne in mind the importance of using the period of a man&apos;ssentence as an opportunity for education is obvious. A surprising numberof soldiers and sailors under sentence are in varying degrees illiterate, andmany are in one way or another anti-social, with distorted ideas of the mean-ing of citizenship and with a remarkable ignorance of world affairs and lackof general knowledge. The Committee consider that much more effortcould be made to occupy the men&apos;s minds and improve their characters whilethey are undergoing detention by an extension of facilities for generaleducation as well as for training in technical military subjects.33. Far more is being clone in connection with this aspect of detentionin the Army than in the -Navy, where very little seems to be attempted. Inall the Army establishments without exception there is an Education Room,sometimes more than one, and frequently an Information Room as well,excellently arranged with cuttings from the illustrated papers, war maps andso forth. Use is made of the cinema and of wireless for educational purposes,and in many places there are regular courses of lectures on current topics,the &quot; Brains&apos; Trust &quot; method of imparting-information is employed (at oneDetention Barracks the Committee observed a &quot; Brains&apos; Trust &quot; in operationwith three officers and three soldiers under sentence conducting the questions),and the &quot; Paclre&apos;s Hour &quot; has its place in the educational scheme.34. On the military training side, all the better equipped establishmentshave assault courses and in some cases miniature ranges, workshops withmachine and motor sections and a tactical study room with a sand table.The proper idea behind all the technical instruction given in detention waswell expressed by an enthusiastic Sergeant Instructor as being &quot; to turn menout to help to win the war.&quot; The Committee welcome the evidence of thisattitude which they found in the best conducted establishments as contrastedwith the merely punitive conception, traces of which still survive in someplaces.
35. Library Books are available at certain hours in all establishmentsand efforts are&apos; made to provide men who wish to study particular subjectswith books bearing upon them. The Committee advocate an extension ofthese privileges as a reward for continued good conduct.86. Opportunities for sport were found in some cases, though in view ofthe necessity for making life in detention less agreeable than life in theServices themselves, these are properly restricted, and have training ratherthan amusement as their object. Boxing is encouraged and well-equippedrings provided, and the men are taken out for route marches, in someestablishments, with a marked effect upon their physique and fitness.37. Welfare Officers are on the strength of all military detention barrackswho work in close collaboration with the Chaplains. But while appreciatingthe value of welfare services in detention the Committee are of opinion thatthese are frequently rendered too late. They desire to emphasise as stronglyas possible the importance of good welfare work in the units from which themen come, as the principal means of saving men from getting into the troublewhich leads to detention. They consider that if the admirable Notes forOfficers issued by the Adjutant-General under the title &quot; The Soldier&apos;sWelfare,&quot; were fully carried into effect, particularly by Company and PlatoonOfficers, perhaps as many as fifty per cent, of those who are now soldiersunder sentence would never have had to be committed to detention.38. Premises which can be used as a chapel are provided in all DBs.and D.Qs., and in most cases these are suitably and adequately furnished.The Committee wish to express appreciation of the work of the Chaplains ofall denominations, many of whom are men of great experience in dealing withthe particular problems they meet. The value of their personal contactswith detainees and of their frequent presence in the Barracks should receivefull recognition.Feeding39. The Committee inspected the midday and afternoon meals at eachplace they visited. The food appeared to be of good quality and was wellcooked. The main complaint made against the diet was that it is monotonous;(cf. paragraph 14) a few complained that it was insufficient. The Committeethink that the main consideration is that the men should be in good health,and that they are is evidenced by their appearance and the fact that themajority gain weight while in detention.40. At some of the Military establishments the diet tins presented avery unattractive appearance. Originally they had been of aluminium butthese had been withdrawn for aircraft construction. They were replaced bytinplated receptacles. In the course of hard usage the tinning wears off andthe metal below becomes stained with rust. This condition is not injuriousto health but is unappetising to sav the least of it. In spite of the exigenciesof war production and the scarcity of tinning facilities the Committee considerthat tl lese diet tins shoukf be rendered and kept bright /
13222PART IIProceedings of the Committee in London41. In tins part of the Eeport the Committee only propose to examinethe effect of statements made to them during their hearings in London andonly such of those statements as alleged violence, ill-treatment and bullyingin the past. The Committee believe that some of these and similar allegationsformed the basis of the general agitation against &quot; Glasshouses &quot; whichfollowed the Clayton case.   (cf. Appendix, 2nd Group, No. 16.)42. The steps taken by the Committee to secure the attendance ofrelevant witnesses were the following:  (a) The name and address of the Secretary were advertised in the Press.(b) The same information was broadcast by the B.B.C.(c) Editors of newspapers which had given prominence to allegations ofbrutality to and ill-treatment of soldiers serving in MilitaryDetention Barracks were requested to put the Committee in touchwith their informants. This they readily did after obtaining theircorrespondents&apos; permission.43. In so far as relates to abuse, bad language, and &quot; chasing,&quot; theCommittee are satisfied, without further particularisation, that these practicesdid exist from the earliest days and were worse at the beginning than they arenow. In this connection it must be borne in mind that the detentionmachinery of the Army at the start of the war was just as backward as therest of the country&apos;s military preparation.44. It is not necessary to trace the history of places of detention which,of course, had to be greatly expanded during the last war. It is sufficientto say that at the outbreak of this war there was only one Military DetentionBarrack and that was Aldershot. The instant and ever-accelerating expansionof the Army produced, of course, a corresponding expansion of the number ofmen under punishment. There were in the Service at the outbreak of waronly forty-five trained Staff Warders. The Committee have already pointedout (paragraphs 22-24) the necessity of training, and the general difficulties ofsecuring willing, capable and trained staff for this purpose. It stands toreason that as continually fresh places had to be opened the difficulties ofstaffing them with efficient personnel continually increased and Aldershotwas the place from which in early days the cadres had to be drawn. Aldershotitself in early days was grossly overcrowded with soldiers in detention andthe Staff was grossly over-worked. If then at Aldershot and other placesinstances of misconduct on the part of the Staffs in the early days were notuncommon it is hardly a matter for surprise. Perhaps also it should not bea matter for wonder if the most grotesque exaggerations and even inventionshave been built upon this foundation. The ill-treatment of helpless humanbeings promptly and properly excites indignation, but for that very reasonit is apt also to promote exaggeration.45. The Committee wish to emphasise once more that of the witnesseswho dealt with these topics at the hearings before the Committee not onewas a naval man and no allegation of any kind was made against the NavalDetention Quarters.46. The procedure adopted was to ask every person who desired to appearbefore the Committee to send to the Secretary a signed statement in writingsetting out the nature of the allegations he wished to make. When these hadbeen received the Committee considered them and, in the case of all deemed
relevant to the Enquiry, appointments were given to their authors to appearin King&apos;s Bench Court No. 2. Their expenses and if necessary the value oftheir lost time were defrayed out of public funds.47. The persons who so appeared before the Committee fell, in theiropinion, into two quite different groups; First, those who were apparentlytelling the truth and whose statements bore investigation; and, secondly,and much more numerous, those who were palpably not telling the truth orwho were, in the opinion of the Committee, utterly unreliable. In dealingwith the former group the Committee desire to repeat that they are notasserting the accusations are true, for the reasons given eaidier in this Report(c/. paragraph 9) but only that they may be true. The statements of thesepersons are summarised in the Appendix. The numbers which are giveninstead of the names of all the witnesses are the numbers assigned to themin the Committee&apos;s original list.48. Several of the worst of the stories in Croup II of the Appendix havebeen published in the Press and have gone before the public as examples ofabominable treatment in these institutions. During the course of their localinvestigations, the Committee again and again came across evidence of (lieeffect that allegations of this kind were having upon the lives and existenceof the Staffs employed in military detention barracks. In some places,members of the Staff, wearing as they do a prominent red flash with&quot; M.P.S.C.&quot; on their shoulders, cannot appear in public without the risk ofaversion, insult, and assault. Many of the best of them keep within their ownprecincts rather than risk the unmerited obloquy incurred by mixing withtheir fellow-citizens outside. In this way men whose work is hard and thank-less enough in the nature of things are deprived of even reasonable recreationand relaxation.49. The Committee desire to acknowledge the unfailing courtesy amiassistance they have received from the Admiralty, the War Office and theCommandants and officers of all the establishments visited. Their task wasgreatly facilitated by the transport arrangements readily made for them bythe Air Ministry and the War Office. Finally they wish to express theirappreciation of the valuable services rendered by their Secretary, MaiorJ. R. Willis.50.   Summary of Recommendations(f) Establishment of M.P.S.C. training school (paragraph 24).(2) Oeneral increase in staff at all establishments (paragraph 22).(3) Existing Regulations against use of obscene language should he morestrictly enforced (paragraphs 22 and 48).(4) Appointment of another Commissioned Officer at N.D.Q. where theCaptain is now the only one.(5) Additional Commissioned Officers at all Military establishments-(paragraph 14).(6) Appointment of whole-time M.O. for each establishment (paragraph27).   Changes of such M.O. should be infrequent (paragraph &apos;29).(7) Provision of Sick quarters in all establishments where they do notexist (paragraph 26).(8) Improvement of night sanitary arrangements in all establishments(paragraphs 30 and 31).(9) That all diet tins be rendered and kept bright -(paragraph 40).
(10) The rigours of Naval Detention in the three prisons make themunsuitable for offenders with long sentences. Such men shouldbe sent to civil prisons after serving not more than 65 months inthe N.D.Qs.(11) Facilities for general education and training should be extended (paragraphs 6(b), 32, 33 and 34).(12) The system of segregation of different types of detainees at present inforce should be strictly maintained &quot;(paragraph 16).Signed:Roland Oliver, Chairman.Members.Arthur, Reading,H. E. A. Boldero,John R. Wileis,  Major, Secretary.\lth October, 1943.APPENDIXSUMMARY OF COMPLAINTS HEARD IN LONDONGroup I(cf. paragraph 47 of Report.)No. 37 was a conscientious objector in detention from March-October 1940 forrefusing to obey orders. He described having been assaulted on his arrival by twomembers of the Staff, one of whom told him that he had been specially sent to&quot; deal with the likes of him.&quot; He was then forcibly undressed (as he refused toundress himself), during the process of which he was repeatedly struck in the stomachand when he fell was lifted up by his hair and struck again until his clothes wereoff. Later in the day his arm was twisted. He also said that he saw the injuredcondition of the witness next to be referred to (No. 36) after the latter had arrived.He further said that on another occasion two Staff Sergeants pushed a soldier intohis (witness&apos;s) cell, turned him out of it, and when soon after they came out thewitness went back to find the soldier lolling in a corner weeping.No. 36 was a conscientious objector who was sent to detention in June 1940and was for a time there with No. 37. He said that when he arrived, because herefused to pick up his rifle and equipment he was struck and his head was violentlyand repeatedly knocked against the wall and that, as he still refused to obey, hewas assaulted and punched about the face and body by a number of the Staff andactually kicked in the eye. He said that the medical officer refused to assist himagainst the N.C.Os. concerned and that he was eventually paraded before theAssistant Commandant and charged with attempted violence against a N.C.O.and, after the evidence had been heard, was punished. The Committee has byenquiry found support, other than No. 37, for the fact that he made the allegationsat once and that his head and face bore marks of violence.(Note. The demeanour of the above two witnesses very favourably impressedthe Committee.)No. 8 was a witness with twenty years Army service and four years Prisonservice. He was on the M.P.S.C. staff from December 1939 to June 1940. Hesaid that there was unnecessary shouting and bullying by the Staff, one or twoor whom were really bullies and used filthy language. He said that a man whohad fainted was slapped in the face by a Staff Sergeant who, in his opinion, wasbullying him and not assisting him, although he added &quot; He was trying to bringhim round.&quot; He mentioned another case where a man who had fainted wasdragged along the corridor to the washhouse by a member of the Staff who put hishead under the tap. He said that he had protested against this treatment to oneof the senior N.C.Os., but that next day he was transferred to another DetentionBarracks.   He made no allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners there.
No. 32 had been serving a sentence in detention during January 1940. He said&apos;ho himself was never physically assaulted, but that on many occasions he had seenmen kicked bv warders and that he had also seen men pushed about and punchedin the back for lagging on parade, and that such things were done quite openlyand anyone could see them. There was no ill-treatment when commissioned officerswere about; which, however, was not often.(Note.-All the above cases, Nos. 37, 36, 8 and 32, relate to the same placeand none of them is later than June 1940.)No. 13 was a conscientious objector who had served twenty-eight days indetention during April-May 1941 for refusing to obey orders. He said that afterbeing chased upstairs by members of the Staff, another member of the Stall&apos; openeda cefl door and the witness, not knowing what he was expected to do, stood still.Ho was then pushed violently into the cell, but did not actually tall. He said hewarned the N.C.O. that he would report him if he broke King\s Regulations,and that the N.C.O., after blustering, became reasonable and intimated that hedid not like the sort of work he had to do. The witness said that was the onlyinstance of physical violence he had seen or experienced.Group II(c/. paragraph 47 of Rej^ort.)No. 9 was a man of a very neurotic type. He had submitted a statementcovering seven very closely typed foolscap sheets. He had been in detention forfour weeks in August and September 1941. The Committee thought that hisstatements bore such obvious marks of exaggeration that, he was quite unreliable.He said that in the Army he had been originally posted to W.T. (wireless telephony)and so was exempt from guard. He had volunteered for Intelligence, but as he hadCommunistic views was not accepted, so he absented himself and procured a falseidentity card in order to indulge in political activities for a time before rejoining&apos;.After being arrested and doing a term in Cardiff Prison he was returned to theArmy. He was put again on to W.T., but was later removed from this work amiordered to go on guard. He refused and was sent to Detention. He said, amongstother things, that men were frequently tripped up by the sergeants when runningat full speed. On being asked if they did not injure themselves, he said ho did notthink he had ever seen one fall down. One of his stories was to this effect, that asquad of fifty men were made to do hard P.T. (physical training) for nearly twohours without a break culminating with marching and countermarching in the&quot;knees bend&quot;, position (the attitude sometime.&apos;: assumed by Russian dancers).Half the squad fell out. Those who did so, including men of over fifty, were thenordered to do fifty &quot; press-ups &quot; from the floor. When they reported having donethat, the instructor said &quot; Go on, do some more, 1 cannot count so well as yon,&quot;and that in the end men were lying all over the place being kicked and buffeted byN.C.Os. He ended up by saying that he had later interviewed an officer who isnow the Commandant of what the Committee thought on the whole was the bestof all the military detention barracks and who is obviously a courteous and patientgentleman. When asked if he had mentioned his matters of complaint to thisofficer, he said &quot; I unfortunately did not.&quot; It appears that the voluminous writtenstatement which he had presented to the Committee had been composed by him in1941 with a view to publication in the Press. The Press had declined to publishit.   The Committee are not surprised.No. 4 was a man who had been in detention between January and August 1941.He said that he had seen a Canadian carried face downwards by four of the Staff,one holding each limb; that a Staff Sergeant P. was kicking the Canadian in theface &quot;He was holding the Canadians left hand; I remember that vividly&quot;;that another Staff Sergeant C. was in the meantime hitting the Canadian in theface with his fist; that it was daylight and he was in a room that was less thantwo yards away when he saw the man being carried; that he saw him carried aboutfifteen yards, but he did not see any blood on the man&apos;s face or on the floor. Inhis written statement to the Committee he had clearly stated that the man whowas kicking the Canadian was not one of those who were carrying him. Further-more, the Committee did not believe that any man would be striking in the facewith his fists a man whose face must have been quite near the ground, nor, if hewas being kicked in the face on one side and hit in the face on the other, that therewould have been no blood on his face or on the ground. The Committee came tothe conclusion that this story was false and they therefore need not further examinea second story which this witness tolcl which also varied from the story he hadwritten in his statement.
No. 10 was a man who had been a professional boxer in civilian life some years. e0 He had been in detention in 1940 and again in 1941. He had eventuallyfgea discharged from the Army suffering from psychoneurosis. Having regard tou;s obviously neurotic condition and general demeanour, the Committee consideredhe was quite unreliable. In this case also his story in one particular entirelydeparted from the written statement with which he had supplied the Committee.Mo. 18 vvas a man who had at one time been in the Military Provost Staff CorpslKl had served on the staff in a military detention barracks.   He said that onone occasion a number of men acting together had escaped at 2 A.M., and severalH-ere caught by the Staff in the act of going over the wire :  &quot; These men were taken into a small tent set aside, and handcuffed to thepole and beaten up in this tent.Q.   Taken into the tent? A.   Yes, My Lord.* -x- * * *Q,   Were yon in the tent or did you look in? A.   I looked in.&quot;* -x- * * *He proceeded to say that the R.S.M. witnessed the beating up though he took nopart in it.&quot; Q.   Was he in the tent? A.   Yes, but I did not see him strike.&quot;He later said that the men made a certain amount of resistance to the beating up.On being asked how they managed that, if they were handcuffed to the tent pole,he changed his whole story and said that there was no beating up in the tentat all and that the beating up took place between the wire where they wereoriginally caught and the tent to which they were taken, and that thehandcuffing was to prevent them escaping again. The above detail has beengiven because this man&apos;s demeanour was rather impressive. The Committee,however, being aware that a man who is telling the truth speaks fromhis recollection and not from his imagination, recognise that whilst he may bemistaken in his recollection he.will always make the same mistake and not telltwo utterly contradictory stories within a minute or two. They conclude that thisstory is false. They do not therefore think it useful to discuss any of the otherstatements he made.No. 19 was a young man of twenty-one who had served a term of detention inDecember 1940. His written statement to the Committee, which was couched invery exaggerated language, did not allege any specific act of violence. He himselfhad a most unattractive demeanour. After having made to the Committeeallegations about the insults and obscene language used by the Staff, he was askedif he had any other complaint. He then complained of the food. Again askedtor further complaints, he complained that the water was cold and no proper timegiven to wash. Again asked if he had any further complaint, he said his room wasdamp and over-crowded and, on the same question being put to him again, hepaused for a considerable time. He was then asked directly: &quot;Did you see orexperience any act of physical violence?&quot; and he said &quot;Yes, I both saw it andexperienced it.&quot; He then made two allegations of very trifling violence which theCommittee did not believe. He ended up as follows: &quot;1 think Hitler would findsome enthusiastic supporters in the detention camps and I shudder at the thoughtthat I am wearing the same uniform as they wear.&quot;No. 26 this man had been in detention for twenty-four days in January 1943.He had declined to supply the Committee with a written statement, but had saidthat he wished to address them for an hour. He was indeed a very loquaciousperson. He made some exceedingly vague and general allegations of &quot; pushingaround,&apos;&apos; kicking, and abuse, all done quite openly for everybody to see. TheCommittee who had visited the detention barracks in question not very long after-wards and scon the regime there did not believe this witness.No. 17-this man had been in detention in November 1941. He said: 1 oncetried to complain of the food. I was told I was lucky to get it. I then asked tosee the Commandant, but did not see him. Two of the Staff came to my room,got mo outside and hit me.&quot; In answer to questions he said that he was hit onthe back with the flat of their hands and that it did hurt. It was pointed out tohim that he had not mentioned that or anything about it in his written statementto the Committee. He replied that he had said it in a statement he had made to&quot; newspaper and this statement was later obtained by the Committee.   The relevant
part is this. After making no reference whatever to his complaint about the food,the statement runs :  -&quot; I, standing in my barrack room, happened to speak at the wrong moment.I was taken outside and beaten (not with fists and away from any witness).&quot;The Committee did not believe him.No. 33 this man had been in detention in February 1943. After making variousuncomplimentary references to the regime of the detention barracks, which did nothowever, include allegations of violence, he said that a soldier, after reportingsick and being given no treatment by the M.O., died in his dormitory of diphtheria&quot;The most serious part of this allegation, of course, would be the leaving of a niaiiin such an infectious condition to die among his comrades. The Committee areinformed from the Records that on the day this man reported sick he was removedto the Camp Medical Reception Station and some days later to a hospital, wherehe died of diphtheria. The Committee regard this as a striking example ofmendacity.No. 39 this man had been in detention in October-December 1941. He saicthat &quot;bullying and punching&quot; of detainees was general happened every daiinnumerable times. Every soldier under sentence must have known it. Officersdid not stay long on parade the knocking about never took place in front ofthem. Before leaving the Army he was sentenced by court-martial to 146 daysfor falsification of accounts. He did not plead guilty, but gave evidence on oathand was disbelieved. The Committee thought his account obviously very greatlyexaggerated and considered him quite unreliable as a witness.No. 16 the Committee desire to call particular attention to the evidence putforward by this witness, as it seems to them to present a striking example of themanner in which the public has been misled regarding the conditions in DetentionBarracks. The witness submitted a signed statement which included the nameand the unit of a man alleged to have Been subjected to gross ill-treatment. Therelevant part of the statement omitting names is as follows:  &quot; There was one soldier in that room 1 knew in civilian life and he was ndecent fellow, clean and everything. Well they gave us three minutes in the bathevery Friday afternoon and he didn&apos;t get the proper bath he should have hadand he was found to be dirty about the knees and feet so the Staff Sergeanttook him out and scrubbed him with a hard scrubbing brush which peeled theskin from his body and he was screaming in agony when he was brought backto the room, and the next day he felt ill and told the men in the room he wasafraid to report sick; anyway he went out and did a day&apos;s work navvying witha pick and shovel and did not look too well, so 1 was pushing the barrow he wasfilling and I saw how ill he was, I reported it to the Staff Sergeant who toldme to mind my own business or 1 would be clipped over the ear, the followingday 1 went to see the sick man at the far end of the room, and he told mohe was too ill to get up, so I told the cleaner to tell the Staff Sergeant,who immediately said &quot;He will have to get up,&quot; and came in and tippedhim out of bed on to the cold concrete floor and he lay there for half-an-hourhelpless, and .1 dare not pick him up or I&apos;d know about it at last the MedicalOfficer came and said he had a cold and to leave him in bed for two days andput him on a milk diet, and I could see the man had a temperature and nothingwas done by the M.O. or Sergeants to find out what his temperature was,and he lay there from Monday to the following Sunday on a milk diet, andthafs not much to live on, on the Sunday a Vicar came visiting from--and without a Sergeant with him. I saw my chance and reported the sick manto him immediately, and he found out he had laid there for six days withpneumonia and he got out of the room and had him removed to an emergencyhospital.&quot;This statement had previously been published with other matter under flaringheadlines in a newspaper and it must have been read by thousands of people.The Committee felt that these terrible allegations&apos;must be thoroughly investi-gated. They, therefore, asked the War Office to trace the man said to have beenthe subject of this abominable ill-usage, and he was found to be in detention again.The Committee obtained from him a statement regarding the treatment he badreceived at the Detention Barracks named during his sentence there, the exacttext of which (with the omission of names is as follows :  &quot;On the 16th May, 1942,  whilst I was serving a sentence of 156 daysdetention, I was with four other S.U.S. at the baths.   When we had finished the
other men went and left me behind as it was tea time. The N.C.O. in chargecalled me back and asked me why the place was left in a dirty condition. Itold him that the other men had gone first and left me to clear up the mess.He then ordered me to clean tip the place and told me to hurry up as it wastea time so 1 did not finish but went into tea.   After tea the N.C.O. whosename I think was--sent for me and told me to finish cleaning up.While I was doing this he threw four buckets of water over me. I was sentback to my room where I changed my clothes and intended reporting the matterto the Commandant on the Monday as the incident occurred on the Saturday.&quot; During the night I was taken ill and at lunch time on the Sunday the M.O.visited me.   I  was sick in room  until the Thursday when I was taken to---- Hospital.   I went to - -  Convalescent Hospital on the 26th Juneand returned to my unit on the 10th July.&quot; Apart from the above incident I was treated qtiite fairly and I have nocomplaint to make.&quot; I hereby declare that the above statement is true in every detail and thatthe dates are correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.&quot;The Committee examined witness No. 16 in London; the following are extractsfrom the transcript of evidence : - Q. Now this incident which you describe I will just read to you what yousaid about this man who was found to be dirty about the knees and feet &quot; . . . . so the Staff Sergeant took him out and scrubbed him with a hardscrubbing brush which peeled the skin from his body and he was screamingin agony when he was brought back to the room.&quot; Is that literally true or isthat exaggerated? A. It is a little exaggerated but not much; he came backinto the room.(). Wait a minute. &quot; The description of the man who was scrubbed is alittle exaggerated.&quot; Now, before you go on. would you mind indicating inwhat way? -.4.   He was not actually screaming, Sir.Q. &quot;He did not actually scream?&quot; A. While he was in the ablutionsbeing scrubbed we heard him screaming there, but when he came back into theroom he was in tears.Q. It is not an exaggeration to say lie was screaming in agony- you meanhe was not screaming when he was brought back into the room? A.   Yes, Sir.Q.    Screaming came from the bathroom? A.   Yes, Sir.Q.   Did 3&apos;ou see that the skin had been peeled off his back? A.   Yes, Sir.Q.   You actually saw it? A.   I did not actually see it; he was in bed very illhe could not get up afterwards.*****Q.   You do not think you have exaggerated it at all? A. No, Sir.The Committee then sent for the man alleged to have been ill-treated and hewas brought to London under escort and appeared before them in private. Hewas cross-examined regarding his statement reproduced above and the followingare extracts from the verbatim report of this examination:  Q.   Do you remember being ill when you were in  --? A.   Yes, Sir.Q. Have you any complaints to make about your medical treatment duringall that time? A.   No, Sir.Q. You do understand that you are perfectly free to talk to us here, doyou not? A.   Yes, Sir.Q. You can say just what you like and you need not be afraid. No onewill ever know you have said it. I am not encouraging you to say anything thatis hot true, but you can tell us the truth without hesitation. You will do that,will you not? A.   Yes, Sir.Q.   You are not afraid? -.4.   No, Sir.Q. You say &quot; I have no complaint against my medical treatment.&quot; Doyou think, for instance, that the Medical Officer neglected you while you werelying in bed in your room or did he look after you well? .4. He visited meevery morning, Sir.Q. Did he appear to take an interest in your condition? .4. Y&quot;es, he gaveme good examinations every morning.*****Q. Just give us your own account of what happened on the Saturdayevening. Is it just as you have written it down in your statement? A. Justas I have mentioned it.
Q. Are you quite sure that the only complaint the Staff made to you inthe ablution room was that you had not finished the task ; the other men hadgone and he accused you of leaving the place dirty? A.   That is correct, Sir.Q. Did he not say anything about your being dirty yourself in your own&quot;person? A.     No, Sir.Q. And did he not make any attempt at all to wash you-himself, scrub you,or anything like that? A.   No, Sir.Q.   Nothing like that ever happened? A.   No, Sir.* * * * *Q. Would it be true to say that the very morning you were ill the Sergeantcame and tipped you out of bed on to the cold concrete floor and left you lyingthere for half-an-hour? A.     I beg your pardon, SirQ You remember that first morning you were ill, would it be true to saythat that morning the Sergeant came and tipped you out of your bed andmade you lie on the cold concrete floor for half-an-hour? A. No, Sir. He didnot let me lie on the cold floor.Q.   That is not true at all? A.   No, Sir.The Committee have thought it necessary to go into these details regarding theevidence of witness No. 16 because the incidents which he alleges have received a-wide publicitv. The Committee could not conceive cf the man denying such ill-treatment if it had happened, and came to the conclusion that No. 16 had beenutterly untruthful. . ^    .The Committee do not suggest that it was anything but highly improper for aStaff Sergeant to throw water over a soldier under his charge, if this did in fact takeplace The man, however, did not suggest that the wetting caused his illness andmedically it is unlikely that it did, though the possibility cannot be excluded. Thepoint to&apos; which the Committee wish to draw attention is the way in which thisincident, if it did occur, has formed the precarious foundation on which has beenbuilt a Sensational story of savage and calculated brutality such as must hareshocked and horrified everyone who read it.GLOSSARY OF ABBREVIATIONSM P. and D.B. ...
