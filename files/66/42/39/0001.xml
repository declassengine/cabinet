HISDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)2 0 4Sji ORE Tw.P.(43) 4893QTH OCTOBER t,  1945COPY NO.WAR CABINETBUILDING LABOUR FOR HOUSING WORKMemorandum by the Minister of HealthIt     With reference to the memorandum by the Minister of Labourand National Service (W.F.(43) 472), I think that I ought todraw the attention of my colleagues, in their consideration ofthe matter, to the increasing urgency of the need for theemployment of more men on housing work and of the necessityfor taking this factor into account in the furtherconsideration of the manpower situation.2.     In a Memorandum which I submitted to the Lord President1sCommittee on the 14th July, 1943, (L.P.(43) 175), I drewattention to the seriousness of the housing position.     Onconsideration of this Memorandum and of the report from tlieAssociation of Local Authorities which was appended to it, theCommittee agreed in principle at their meeting on 16th J-u.ly(L,P.(43) 49th Meeting^ Conclusion 2(l)) that, after thedemands for building for war purposes had been met, housingshould have first call on immobile building labour.Detailed arrangements for giving effect to this principlewere subsequently worked out by the Minister of Labour andnational Service, the Minister of Works, the Secretary of State ffca?Scotland and myself in consultation and, with the approval of theCommittee, I issued a circular to Local Authorities on11th October.3*     The extent to which the scheme can help in the presentdifficulties must depend very largely on the amount of labourwhich can be made available a     In my discussion with theAssociations of Local Authorities they expressed their readinessto accept the scheme as experimental, but they made it clearthat their further attitude must be governed by the results,and that these, in their view, would be dependent mainly onthe amount of labour which could be made available.     In thereport (appended to L.P.(43) 175) the Local Authorities urgedthat not only should existing available labour be concentratedon repair and maintenance, but also that as men were releasedfrom Government contracts they should be added to this numberand that the total should be maintained at the highest possiblelevel by any necessary reservations of the men in question.This point has been stressed in the subsequent discussions whiohI have had with the Associations oi Local Authorities who have^ade it clear that in view of the constant pressure to whichthey are subjected on account of housing difficulties in theirindustrial areas they will wish for an early review in thelight of their experience of the working of the scheme.     Itwill have most unfortunate reperaussions if it is found thatno more building labour can be made available because it has inthe meantime been absorbed on other work or called up ta the-Po^ces^

4.     Since I last drew the attention of my colleaguesto this question the urgency of the housing question has&quot;been emphasised by the continued representations which Ihave received^     Demands lor improvement as a matter ofurgendy come from all quarters - from the Press* fromParliament,, from Local Authorities and from manyindividuals.     I may mention the numerous questions onhousing posed at the Women1 s Meeting at the Albert Hall,the references to the problem at the recent meeting ofthe Transport and General Workers Union addressed bythe Minister of Labour and National Service, and thecomplaints expressed in the Ministry of InformationBulletin and in correspondence passing through thePostal and Telegraphic Censorship,,5*     I must point out also the difficulties now beingexperienced in the supply of labour on work with whiohI am concerned within the Government Building Programme.For instance despite every effort and the cordial co-operation of the Ministry of Labour and National serviceand the Ministry of Works the number of men working onthe 3,000 agricultural cottages is still only half thenumber wanted to achieve satisfactory progress.     Onsites in certain areas it is impossible to find anylocal labour and the complement can only be made up bydirecting mobile labour from other areas...    Anyreduction in the number of men susceptible to directionwould be a further thro the progress of the worl *6.      Should it be found, however, that men are, in fact,to be released from G-overninont contracts: and are notwanted for other urgent war work, I would urge moststrongly that these men should be made available foressential housing work0     In view of the costs ofbuilding I v/ould not at the moment suggest any newhouse building, but what I have in mind is that morelabour should bo made available for the Repair Schemeand in addition for site works necessary in preparationfor new housing schemes0     Work of this kind would, /ifundertaker^ help to improve morale and sustain the homefront, and wouldy moreover.* reduce the amount of housingwork required aft or the war,, and leave a nucleus of thebuilding industry sufficient to cope with the reduced^but still gigantic, tasks of the peace problem.(Intd,)       E.B,Ministry of HoaLJh. o,/-&apos;.r30TH OCTOBER,  1943-
