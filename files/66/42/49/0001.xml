&apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 8 GOVERNMENT)   ct r-t e\&apos;-------------.--------.-------------------------------.-------------------  ^7JSECRETW.P. (45) 4992ND__NOVEwLoER ^  1 COPY NO._i_--WAR cabinetWIDOWS&apos; WAR PENSIONS AND GRATUITIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1, In Part I of his Memorandum the First Lord of theAdmiralty proposes an improved scheme of pension for thewidows of retired officers who lose their lives whileundertaking further service during the present war.      TheFirst Lord;s proposal relates primarily to the widows ofretired Flag Officers who lose their lives while servingas Commodores of Convoy, but I am entirely in agreement withhim that it would not be practicable to differentiatebetween this particular class of retired officers and otherretired officers re-employed02. as stated in the Minister of Pensions&apos;  paper(W.P0 (45) 483),  rates of war pension are determined by thedegree of responsibility attaching to the post occupied atthe time of the death or injury.      This general principleoperates both ways:    an officer occupying a higher postthan he has previously held gets the &quot;benefit of the higherpaid rank if he is  disabled,  as does his widow in the eventof his death,      The First Lord&apos;s proposal, to  give thewidow of a re-employed retired officer (if it is to heradvantage) a pension based on her husband&apos;s former rankon the active list instead of on that of the appointmentheld at the time of his death, -would place the re-employedretired officer in a specially privileged position comparedwith the active list regular and the war entrant, and Ifeel much doubt whether this would be justified,      Theactive list officer for instance may at some    earlier datehave occupied a position of greater responsibility thanthat in which he was serving at the time of his death,while many war entrants to  the forces have given upsubstantial positions.      The Government have only recentlyrefused to introduce a scheme of &quot;alternative Dens ions&quot;,based on the pensioner s former position in civil lifesimilar to  that in operation in the last war.s3r The widows of retired officers who lose their -liveswhile serving as Commodores of Convoy deserve the utmostsympathy, but I cannot think that it would be wise toattempt to introduce any improvement in the pensions payablein their particular case.Part IT,,_____&quot;Killed in Action&quot; Gratuity4. The proposal in Part II of the First Lord&apos;s Memorandumrelating to the conditions of payment of the &quot;killed inaction&quot; gratuity, like that concerning widows of Commodoresof Convoy, has already been the subject of much discussionbetween Deportments.    The gratuity in question,  the ratesof which range from  100 to  2,000 according to  the rankof the officer concerned, is payable in addition to widows&apos;

pension to the widows of officers &quot;killed in action or dyingwithin 7 years of wounds received in action&quot;.      There is.noprovision for the payment of such a gratuity to the widowsof officers dying from attributable disease or to thewidows of ether- ranks dying in any circumstances.5. The &quot;Killed in Action&quot; Gratuity dates from a timewhen injuries or death sustained in the course of activeoperations  against the enemy were considered worthy ofmore generous compensation th n disabilities contracted inother circumstances,.        Such a discrimination is contraryto ijresjnt day sentiment and it has for some years pastbeen an accepted principle of the Services Pension Codesthat.the pension payable in respect of death or disablementattributable to service should be at the same rate, whateverthe circums tances in which the death or injury wassustained,,      It is therefore generally agreed that inpresent times the &quot;Killed in Action&quot; gratuity has no logicalbasis and that its retention can be justified only ongrounds of tradition^      Its abolition at the first convenientopportunity was in fact recommended in 1930 by an inter-departmental Committee on which the three ServiceDepartments were represented, and its continuance to  thepresent time is due only to the existence of a similargratuity for the widows of officers killed on flying duty.It was accepted before the outbreak of the present war bythe Departments concerned that as soon as the &quot;Plying&quot;gratuity could be dispensed with, the &quot;Killed in Action&quot;gratuity should also disappear,6. The basis of entitlement to the &quot;Killed in Action&quot;gratuity proposed by the First Lord would allow payment ofthe gratuity not only to the widows of officers killedwhile engaged in active operations against the enemy, butalso,  e.g., ,  in cases of death resulting from trainingaccidents or from marine perils, where there is only aremote connection between the duties onvhich the officerwas engaged at the time of his death and active operationsagainst the enemy,,      It is true that the basis of paymentwhich the First Lord -proposes for the present war wasadopted during the last war.      The- conditions of the presentwar, however, differ- in many respects from those of 1914-1918t.      The rates of war pensions no longer depend on whetherthe injury was sustained in battle or otherwise.      TheService officer is now recruited from the ranks, and theCaptain of a heavy bomber is frequently a Sergsant,       In suchcircumstances  it would be difficult if payment of &quot;killedin action&quot; gratuity were allowed to  the widow of an officerrun over by a tank during training,  to justify its refusalto the widow of an officer  dying from heat stroke in Libya,or to the widow of a Sergeant Pilot lost over Berlin,-    Iftherefore payment of the &quot;Killed in Action&quot; gratuity is tobe retained on its present. Las is, as a special privilegeof certain limited categories, it seems very necessary torestrict entitlement to  cases clearly satisfying thedefinition &quot;killed in action&quot;,  to  the exclusion of allcases of accidental death, whether from discharge offirearms, marine perils, or otherwise,  in which the actionof the enemy does not play a direct part,,      A formula hasbeen agreed between the Treasury and the Ministry of Pensionswhich would cover the types of case which can,  in theirview,  legitimately be admitted with due regard to theconditions of modern warfare (see Appendix),,

7. A rule on these lines would,  I realize, not beconsistent with the treatment of the Flying gratuity(referred to above) payment&apos; of which is allowed in casesof death resulting from flying accidents as well as duringoperations.      Unless both the &quot;Killed in Action&quot; and theFlying gratuities were dispensed with altogether theanomalies to which they give rise could be eliminated onlyby payment of a gratuity to all widows,  whether of officersor other ranks, where death is attributable to war service.Having regard to the substantial improvements  in warpensions generally,  introduced only a few months ago, thereis no occasion for such a further general increase in theform of a gratuity.      On the other hand,  if entitlementto the &quot;Killed in Action&quot; gratuity continues to be allowedonly on the limited basis I have suggested,  its payment(where admissible) could be justified as conforming totradition, notwithstanding the changed outlook and practiceof modern times.J. A,&apos;reasury Chambers, S.W.1. ,2nd November, 1943.APPENDIXConditions agreed between the Treasury and theMinistry of Pensions regarding the payment of the &quot;Killedin Action&quot; gratuity in the present war,The Gratuity will be payable in respect of deathcaused by:-(a) a missile of any character discharged by the enemy,or by our own forces in combating an actual orimagined attack by the enemy.(b) an actual or presumed specific act on the partof the enemy e. g.   discharge of a torpedo or thelaying of a mine.(c) any act on the port tot our own-forces whileattacking or proceeding to attack the forcesof the enemy.
