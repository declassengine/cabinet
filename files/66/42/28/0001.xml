THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ft PPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.MOST SECRET.Copy No. 1 (W.P. (43) 478.25th October, 1943.WAR CABINET.RECIPROCAL AID TO UNITED STATES.Memomorandum by the minister of state, foreign office.THE Chancellor&apos;s paper on Reciprocal Aid (W.P. (43) 477) raises an issuewhich is fundamental to Anglo-American relations. There is no doubt that tothe great bulk of Americans Lend-Lease is a service which is rendered to theAllies and for which repayment in some form or other is due after the war.And there is unfortunately little doubt that the Administration is being forced,for reasons of domestic politics, to put Lend-Lease back on to that kind of basis.In short, the War Debts issue is being revived, and unless steps are taken to killit the War Debts controversy will poison all our relations with the United Statesas it poisoned them in the period between the two wars.The best definition of Lend-Lease is that which was given by the Presidentin his Report to Congress on Lend-Lease operations in June 1942. &quot; Our Lend-Lease programme,&quot; said the President. &quot; is one means, and a simple one, by whichthe common economic effort pledged in the Declaration by United Nations may besecured. The Lend-Lease principle, as it develops, is removing the possibilitythat considerations of finance can interfere with the full use of material resources.The transfers made under the Lend-Lease Act are not commercial loans to othernations. They are contributions of material to a common pool with which acommon war is being waged. In return other United Nations are contributingtheir utmost to the common fight-in men, materials and machines -and arefurnishing us with the weapons and supplies which we, rather than they, canmost effectively use.&quot; The President^ statement expresses perfectly our ownconception of Mutual Aid. It would be foolish to suppose, however, that it is aconception which has in any way penetrated to public&apos; opinion in the UnitedStates.   It has not.Unfortunately it is a fact that the Administration is no longer attemptingto put across its own public opinion the idea of Mutual Aid as a pooling of allresources, human as well as material, for a common purpose. Two months agothe President publicly withdrew a statement which had appeared over hissignature to the effect that the only coin in which the United States could be paidwas victory and a secure peace. More than that, he went out of his way tospeak of repayment and omitted any reference to the Mutual Aid Agreement.When I was in Washington recently for the Article 7 conversations it was madeclear to me that the Administration was most unwilling to let it be known thatour talks were connected in any way with the Mutual Aid x\greement, which, Iwas told, was very bad politics.&quot; Now the Administration is firmly opposedto publication of the White Paper on Reciprocal Aid, in spite of the fact thatless than three weeks ago Mr. Stettinius urged me to do what I could when Igot back to expedite publication.It is clear from all this that the Administration is unwilling to face upto the issue of Mutual Aid before the Presidential election. They are evidentlypreparing, when the Senatorial enquiry gets going, to defend Lend-Lease as a12181   [26297]
business transaction and to damp down public interest in the question. I denot doubt that these tactics will be successful. But the more successful they arethe more firmly will the conviction take root in the American mind that Lend-Lease is a business deal for which a material return is justly due. It is certainthat if the Administration are unwilling to fight the battle now, they will notbe able to fight it at any time between now and November of next year. And whenthe election comes I have little doubt that Lend-Lease will be one of the majorissues, and that both parties will declare that they have not sold the pass, thatthe door is still open, that no material interest has been sacrificed and so forth.This is a situation which is potentially highly dangerous. It has been ourpolicy, very rightly, to do everything we can to support the Administration andto assume that they must be the best judges of any matter affecting Americanpolitics. This case, however, raises slightly different issues. We are concernednot only with the Administration. We have a case to put before American publicopinion. So far it has gone by default; and if the Administration, for very goodreasons, are unable to fight our battle for us it is for consideration whether weshould not fight it for ourselves, and whether, indeed, we can afford not to fightit. Tor we must remember that this is a battle which must be fought one day.I cannot see that it will be any easier in the future than it is now. For a numberof reasons I believe that it will become progressively more difficult.We are faced, in fact, with an extremely awkward dilemma. If we allowourselves to be persuaded by the Administration not to publish the White Paperour case will go by default and Lend-Lease will merge imperceptibly into WarDebts. If, on the other hand, we make a stand now we shall be acting againstwhat the Administration believe to be, rightly or wrongly, their immediatepolitical interest.R. K. L.Foreign Office, 25th October, 1943.
