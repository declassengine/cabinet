DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY! OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)\Z)  1+5 2. -J COPY NO.October,  19^4-3.WAR    C A3 II1B TLlectoral ReformNote by the Home Secretary.In the Report of the Committee on Electoral Machinery(W.P. (i+3)khO)  it is suggested that,  if the Cabinetapprove the recommendation that there should be a Debatein the House of Commons on the electoral system early inthe new session,  an announcement about this should bemade in the near future.      It would be as well,  I think,that any such announcement should refer to theGovernment1s proposals as regards electoral machinery andredistribution,  as well as giving a general indicationof the scope of the Debate, so that the proposal to havethe Debate may be seen in its proper perspective, andit may be of assistance to my colleagues to see theattached draft of the statement which I would suggestshould be made.      It would be most appropriate that itshould be made by the Leader of the House.K. M.Home Office,8th October,19hp.

To ask when it is proposed to give the House anopportunity of discussing quest ions of electoral reform.P r o p o s o d cm z w o r.Yes, Sir.      The Government propose to give timefor a debate on electoral reform.As the House is aware,  a Bill has been presented togive effect to the scheme recommended by the DepartmentalCommittee on Electoral Machinery.      The Government arefully conscious of the importance of giving attention toall measures designed to secure that whenever there is anappeal to the country - whether at by-elections or at aGeneral Election - the result shall be fully and trulyrepresentative of the views of the people.      It will nodoubt be the wish of the House, as it is of the Goveramenthat this measure should be passed before the end of thepresent session.My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has alsoannounced the Government&apos;s intention to submit toParliament legislation on the subject of redistribution.In addition, however, to measures of this kinddesigned to improve the machinery by which the existingParliamentary franchise is exercised, the Governmentrecognise that full consideration ought to be given tovarious proposals for changes in the existing franchiselaw,  for controlling the expenditure allowable tocandidates, and for other amendments designed to securethe maximum of fairness in the conduct of elections.In the opinion of the Government the best method ofsecuring a full examination of these problems will beby a Conference, presided over by Mr.  Speaker,  and ifthe House concurs in the proposal the Government v/ouldpropose that Mr.  Speaker should be invited to undertakethis important task in addition to his already onerousduties.In the first instance, however,  as I have alreadystated the Government desire that there should be a wideDebate on electoral reform in order to give the House afull opportunity of expressing its opinion,,      We propose,therefore, to set apart two days for this Debate earlyin the new session.
