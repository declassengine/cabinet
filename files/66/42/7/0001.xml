Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 457.IWi October, 1943.WAR CABINET.WIDOWS&apos;   WAR   PENSIONS   AND   GRATUITIES.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.Part I.Retired Flag Officers re-employed as Commodores of Convoy.AT a meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 8th July (W.M. (43)95th Conclusions, Item I (d)), the Prime Minister stated that in his opinionsome concession was called for for widows of retired Flag Officers re-employed asCommodores whose death is attributable to war service, and he directed me toraise this issue.Various suggestions, which will be familiar to the Departments concerned,have been made to overcome the existing difficulty. After considering these, Iam satisfied that there is only one satisfactory solution of this problem; that is,to grant to the widow of such an officer the attributable rate appropriate to thehighest substantive rank which the officer has attained on the active list. Sucha concession appears to me to conform to the general peace-time principle thatthe pension which the widow receives is conditioned by the rank to which herhusband has risen in the Service. The concession could not be restricted towidows of Commodores of Convoy, but would have to be of general applicationto all widows of retired officers who lost their lives on service while re-employedin a lower rank than their highest substantive rank, whether they belonged tothe Navy, Army or Air Force.The device of giving, in addition to non-attributable pension, an appropriateCivil Defence award or the attributable award appropriate to the rank in whichthe officer was serving, provided that the total pension does not exceed theattributable award appropriate to the officer&apos;s permanent rank, does not seem tome to afford a satisfactory solution. In fact I should feel the greatest difficultyin defending this in the House of Commons.Accordingly, I suggest that the War Cabinet should adopt the proposal setout in paragraph 2 above.Part II.&apos;&apos; Killed in A ction &apos;&apos; Gratuities.It seems to me desirable also to consider at the same time the question of theso-called &quot; killed in action &quot; gratuities.Gratuities are payable to widows of officers killed as a direct result of enemyaction or of operations in which enemy action plays a direct part, but theoccasions on which these gratuities are payable have been restricted since the lastwar. They are no longer payable when death is due to the loss of a ship incollision or in heavy weather, though they are if death is due to a flying accident.The Service Departments consider that the practice of the last war should befollowed, and that gratuities should be based on the formula: &quot; Violent deathdue directly or wholly to the special risks of war service.&quot;Copy No.w[26246]
2Part III.Example showing Effect of foregoing Proposals.Admiral Sir Studholme Brownrigg, who was Commander-in-Chief at theNore early in the war. was lost while serving as Commodore of Convoy,presumably through stress of weather :   (1) Widow&apos;s pension under present  rules  (as  Commodore&apos;swidow)......      ..................      290Under rules now proposed (as Admiral&apos;s widow)    ...      ...      540(2) Widow&apos;s &quot; killed in action &quot; gratuity, under present rules      NilUnder rules now proposed (as Commodore&apos;s widow) ...      800Admiralty, 13th October, 1943.A.
