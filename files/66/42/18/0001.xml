The foregoing availability will be reduced to theextent that offerings of other parties to the protocol are carried in the shipping-referred to hereinafter.The United States will supply the shipping tonnage which, with the Soviettonnage presently employed, will lift 225,000 short tons per month via the Pacificroute, on the understanding that the turn-around is to be of 90 days&apos; durationand that the United States will lend every assistance to the Union of SovietSocialist Republics in order that this may be achieved, and on the further under-standing that, should any untoward events close the Pacific route to the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics or restrict its use, United States tonnage trans-ferred to the Soviet flag for employment on this route will be used on other-available-routes to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for lifting protocolsupplies, for the shipment of which the United States is responsible.The United States will undertake to lift by either the Northern route or thePersian Gulf route, whichever in the light of changing conditions proves fromtime to time to be more efficient, a total of 200.000 short tons a month, providingsuch capacity proves to be available to the United States. Furthermore, if futureconditions permit, the United States agrees to increase this amount as the over-allcircumstances justify.The foregoing commitments as to shipping will include the movement ofsupplies selected from Canadian offerings and from United Kingdom offerings ofwool and lead originating in Australia and New Zealand, and such suppliesoriginating in North America, as, bv agreement between the Governments of theUnited States and United Kingdom, are to continue to be carried m United Statesvessels, as well as shipments from such sources as may become necessary inmeeting the commitments of the United States. All shipping commitments aresubject to the provisions of Article II of this protocol.The Government of the United States offers the following schedule ofsupplies, aggregating some 7,080.000 short tons, from which it will be necessaryfor the Soviet Government to select, as promptly as practicable, a program ofparticular supplies for dispatch which does not exceed the shipping limitationsoutlined above, i.e., 5,100.000 short tons, exclusive of fly-away airplanes, to whichmay be added 500.000 short tons for stockpile and carryover, or a total of5,600.000 short tons. This program should include all cargo to be transported inthe shipping referred to above from the United States, or from other sources,after the 1st July. 1943. including protocol and non-protocol items on hand, onorder or to be ordered. Protocol and non-protocol material delivered but notexported as of the 30th June, 1943. will be available for selection within thelimitations as to tonnage.In the execution of the program of supplies listed in the attached schedule,the Government of the United States will be guided by the selections of theGovernment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as described in thedocument dated the 1st September. 1948, annexed to this preamble.It is appreciated that reasonable stockpiles of stores must be maintained inthe United States so that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics can, from monthto month, select cargo for shipment that is most needed to meet the ever-Changingrequirements of war. However, the United States reserves the right to limit1 thesize of such individual stockpiles, either by control of production or diversionof product, or both, when in its judgment such action is in the best interest ofthe common cause. In taking such action, due consideration will be given tothe expressed needs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
When production is curtailed or material is diverted, the arrearages in thevarious items involved will be given all possible consideration in conformity withfuture realistic shipping programs, Soviet desires, other urgent war require-ments and reasonable production schedules.The offerings made in the United States schedule of supplies are subjectto specifications which shall be in accord with current United States&apos; conservation and production practices and practicable and specific material scheduling.The United States stands ready, through appropriate officials, to discusswith Soviet representatives in Washington all detailed questions pertaining tothe schedule of stores and services and any reasonable adjustments that may bedesired.Above all, the United States desires again to assure the Union of SovietSocialist Republics that it has a full understanding of the vital importance ofthe Soviet front and the urgent necessities of moving supplies to it in the highestpossible volume and in the shortest space of time.It is desired to emphasize that the Government of the United States is notonly willing but is very anxious to render the assistance outlined. The SovietGovernment may rest assured that the provisions described in Articles II and Yof this protocol will not be invoked by the Government of the United States unlessdevelopments definitely require it.Axxex to Preamble.UNITED STATES SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES AX D SHIPMENTS.Memorandum .Below is the answer of the Soviet Government to the proposals made by theGovernment of the United States regarding the Third Protocol :  &quot; In view of the fact that the United States Government does not agree tomake available shipping space trading under the United States flag in excess at2.400.000 short tons for United States shipment to the Soviet Union under theThird Protocol through the Atlantic Ocean, the Soviet Government, with thepurpose of reconciling of the amount of deliveries with available shippingfacilities, agrees to decrease the program of supplies under the Third Protocolproposed by the United States Government from 7,080,000 tons to 5,600,000 tons,including 500.000 tons of stocks and carry-overs, by decreasing the quantities ofthe following items (in short tons) :  (a) Wheat and flour, 700.000 tons (including deliveries from Canada) insteadof 1,680.000 tons.(b) Concentrated foods. 177,000 tons instead of 252,000 tons.(c) Ferrous metals, 500,000 tons instead of 710.000 tons.(d) Petroleum products, 360,000 tons instead of 565,000 tons.(e) A7arious chemicals. 9,200 tons instead of 18,800 tons.At the same time the Soviet Government agrees to the above-mentioneddecrease in the deliveries of the petroleum products on the provision that theGovernment of Great Britain will continue deliveries of aviation gasoline to theU.S.S.R. from Persia at the rate of 10,000 tons per month during the ThirdProtocol period, and the United States Government will replace these deliveriesto England out of its own supplies without decreasing the above-mentionedamount of petroleum product deliveries to the U.S.S.R. from the United Statesof America.The Government of the U.S.S.R., agreeing to decrease the program ofdeliveries under the Third Protocol, is relying upon the assurance of the UnitedStates Government that the United States agrees to increase the afore-mentionedamount of deliveries if conditions permit and circumstances justify it in future/&apos;Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,Washington, 1st September, 1943.
