-15th October-,  1943.war   cabinetagricultural prices and post-war policyO Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture  and. Fisheriesand the Secretary of State for Scotland1. Recent and forthcoming increases in agricultural wagesresulting from decisions of the Agricultural Wages Board areestimated to raise aggregate labour costs in the U.K. &quot;by  15million in a full year.      This has created a situation which v/illrequire very careful handling.2. We consider,  and the Lord President&apos;s Committee haveagreed, that no general compensatory rise in agricultural pricesshould t ake place.3. At the same time the maintenance of maximum foodproduction at home must be assured for at least some four orfive years to come.4. We can see our way to deal with the immediate situation,on lines which have been approved by the Lord President&apos;sCommittee (See Appendix),  if we can show that the industry hasgood grounds for confidence in the future.5. One of the essential requirements for this is that weshould be authorised to announce that the present system offixed prices and an assured market will be continued for atleast four- years,  i,e.  up to said including the harvest&apos; of 1947.The present guarantee, given in November,  1940,  is for theduration of hostilities and for at least one year- thereafter.The term &quot;duration of hostilities&quot; has not been defined,  andthere may obviously be a wide difference in the peri-od coveredby the guarantee according to whether the reference is tohostilities With Germany or with Japan.      In the light of thefood situation in the immediate post-war period as envisagedby the Hot Springs Conference it is quite clear, we suggest,  thatthe extension of the assurance which we now propose can be givenwith confidence.6. But we feel bound also to report that there is growinguneasiness in agricultural circles, both in Parliament and inthe country,  at the delay in opening discussions with the industryon post-war agricultural policy.      The cose for entering intoexploratory discussions is set out in our Memorandum W.P.(43) 422.We would only add that we believe that these discussions can beconducted without in any way committing ourselves or the Government(ItId.)
