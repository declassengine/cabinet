gS S C R i T* JfIl-IIIMHSZ- COPY. i^p....3.1.^.2nd November, 194-5.*&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot; * T&quot; \.M    CABI1I3T ,BUIIDIN&amp;   LABOUR   FOR.. HOUSING. WORK..Memoranchjm by the1 Secretary of State^ for Scotland1.     I agree with the view expressed &quot;by the Minister of Health in hismemorandum. V/.P. (43)4-09 that there is an urgent need for the employment ofmore men on housing work.2.     The housing shortage in Scotland is even more acute than it is in England(for example, overcrowding-is six-times as bad) and I am constantly &quot;beingpressed by Scottish local authorities - particularly those on Clydeside -to arrange for the building of more houses.     Within the past few weeks I havehad to receive a number of deputations representing Scottish local authoritieswho have impressed on me that the position in their areas is becomingIncreasingly serious.     Tuberculosis is rapidly on the increase.5.     Four schemes have been undertaken this year to ease the positionJ-(a) it was agreed that additional labour should &quot;be made available toaccelerate the completion of the houses which local authorities had underconstruction at the beginning of the year;(b) Local authorities were authorised to build 1,000 new houses, GOO of whichwere allocated to industrial areas on Clydeside;(c) Arrangements have been made for the Scottish Special Housing Associationto &quot;build GOO emergency houses on Clydeside.     These houses will consistof standard Ministry of Works huts adapted for use  is temporary houses;and(d) Arrangements have &quot;been made in Scotland similar to those made by theMinistry of Health in England under which immobile labour will so far aspossible be concentrated on essential housing work (e.g, urgent repairs,adaptation of requisitioned premises),4. As I have indicated in paragraph 2 the  local authorities are far fromregarding these measures as adequate.     But the position is very much aggravatedby the fact that serious difficulties are being experienced in obtaining thelabour&quot; necessary to enable reasonable progress to be made even with these-;&apos;approved schemes.      In particular I understand from local enquiries that-ffprsome considerable time it will not be possible to get anything like the headof labour needed for the 800 new houses and the GOO emergency houses onClydesideo     This is, I believe, largely due to the special demands which arebeing made &quot;by the service departments for work in the West of Scotland,i5. For these reasons I would strongly oppose any proposal which woulddeplete the present labour -force in Scotland and so accentuate our existingdifficulties.     Indeed I regard it as essential that everything possible shouldbe done to increase the number of men employed on housing work.6. I agree with what the Minister of Health says in paragraph G of hismemorandum about the need for qarrying out now a programme of site works for newhousing schemes.     This is a matter about which local authorities are continuallymaking representations and it would go a long way to show that the Governmentare fully alive to the urgency of the housing problem if some work of sitepreparation could be done in the areas where housing needs are greatest.
7.        In deciding v;hat labour can be made available - especially forsite v.&apos;orks - v;e should, I think, seriously consider the employment ofIrish labour and Italian prisoners of v;ar.     I understand that Irishlabour could be obtained and nov that the harvest is over Italianprisoners of var could be made available for building work in a numberof areas.*Scottish Office.2nd November, 1943.
