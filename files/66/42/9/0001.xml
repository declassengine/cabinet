THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE.STY&apos;S GOVERNMENT 2 8SECRET Copy No. 33W.P. (43) 459(Also G.O.S. (43) 280)14th October, 1943WAR CABINETWEEKLY RESUME(No. 215)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR SITUATIONfrom 0700 7th October, to0700 14th October,1943[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
AZORES.1. Portugal has granted Great Britain certain facilities in the Azores. As aresult of diplomatic negotiations, followed by a visit to Lisbon of a British Servicesand Departmental Mission to discuss details, an agreement was signed on the17th August which gave us unrestricted use of Lagens airfield on lerceira, theemergency use of Rabo de Peixe on San Miguel, and the unrestricted use of portand fuelling facilities at Horta, on Fayal.A convoy with naval escort arrived oft&apos; the Islands on the 8th. The forceconsists principally of R.A.F. ground and administrative staffs, and militaryworks companies for the development of the airfield. A temporary combinedH.Q. has been set up at Angra (Terceira).Portugal remains responsible for the defence of the Islands, with the excep-tion of Lagens airfield, which a unit of the R.A.F. Regiment will defend.NAYAL SITUATION.General Review.2.   Midget submarines have made a successful attack on the Tirpitz.Six U-boats have been sunk and one probably sunk.In the Mediterranean and Levant three Allied destroyers have been lost.Shipping losses for the week are light, and for the month of September areonly slightly above those of August.Northern Waters.3. On the 22nd September a number of midget submarines (about 50 feet inlength and with a crew of four) carried out an attack on the German warshipsin Altenfiord.As a result of photographic reconnaissance and the interrogation of the crewswho have returned, there is every reason to believe that damage was inflicted onthe Tirpitz.Photographs show Tirpitz surrounded by thick oil which covers a distanceof more than two miles from her berth, and with a number of small craft alongside.A number of very heavy detonations was heard in the immediate vicinity at thetime the attack was expected.Three midget submarines are missing from this operation but the Germansclaim to have captured some prisoners.Home Waters.4. HALS. Mallard (corvette) engaged and drove oft E-boats which wereprobably minelaying off the East Coast.On the 9th light coastal forces on patrol in the Channel were fired on byenemy shore batteries; subsequently a lively engagement was seen to take placebetween enemy craft in the vicinity.H.M. trawler Heroine shot down an enemy aircraft on the 8th off Sheerness.H.M.S. Skate (destroyer) and H.M. S/M Sealion collided in the Clyde andboth ships were damaged.N.W. Approaches.5. The Polish destroyer Orkan, covering a homeward-bound convoy, wastorpedoed and sunk on the 8th in mid-Atlantic. The captain was lost. One officerand 43 ratings were rescued.Mediterranean.6. Two U.S. destroyers have been lost. U.S.S. Buck was sunk by U-boatoff Naples on the 9th, and U.S.S. Bristol was sunk, probably by U-boat, offPhilippeville on the 13th while escorting a fast convoy.H.M.S. Hythe (minesweeper), escorting a west-bound convoy, was sunk byU-boat off Bougie on the 11th.H.M. S/M Usurper overdue from patrol, must be considered lost.Three Italian submarines have been sent to Naples from Malta to supplyelectric power. It is hoped by the 20th to have eight berths available for Libertyships at Naples.
H.M. ships at Termoli shot clown two enemy aircraft on the 6th.Allied coastal forces operated off Elba on the night of the 9th/10th.,U.S. craft torpedoed one ship and M.T.Bs. attacked a lighter and an armedtrawler which were forced to return to P. Vecchio.The Polish S/M Sokol sank two ships, of 6,000 and 4,000 tons, off Polaand damaged by gunfire a troopship on the 7th.H.M. S/jVT Unshaken machine-gunned a lighter full of troops off Elba onthe 2nd.Levant.7. On the 7th an enemy convoy with troops, amznunition and supplies, wassighted approaching the Leros area. ELM. S/M Unruly shelled the convoy andhit a 1,500-ton ship and a small ship, and sank one of four Siebel ferries. LaterH.M. cruisers Sirius and Penelope with the destroyers Faulknor and Fury sanksix landing craft, one ammunition ship and one armed trawler (reported lastweek). Some hours after the engagement, a landing craft and an escort vessel,both badly damaged, arrived at Stampalia; they were seized by the garrison and80 prisoners were taken. HALS. Penelope was later bombed in the ScarpantoStrait and damaged, ari-iving at Alexandria the following day. H.M.S. Carlisle(A.A. cruiser) and three destroyers carried out a sweep off Kos and Leros on thenight of the 7th/8th and on the 9th this force was heavily dive-bombed by Stukasin the Scarpanto Strait. HALS. Panther was sunk and Carlisle damaged and.towed to Alexandria. Panther had 1 officer and 19 ratings killed and17 wounded.Eour ships and some 17 small craft were sighted at or near Kos on the10th and some shipping at Kalymnos on the 11th.Sweeps were carried out by cruisers and destroyers on the nights of the12th and 13th without results.HAL S/M Unsparing took an abandoned schooner in tow off Beirut onthe 9th.Pacific.8. A ferry steamer, plying between Japan and Korea, probably thes.s. Congo Maru (7,000 tons) was sunk by an Allied submarine on the 5th.Seventy of the 616 passengers were saved.9. Three U.S. destroyers engaged a force of four or five Japanese destroyersnorth-west of Vella Lavella on the 6th. Three destroyers were sunk and onedamaged. Another group of four destroyers, who may have been transportingevacuees, retired. One U.S. destroyer was torpedoed and sunk. The Japaneseadmit the loss of the destroyer Yogumo. . On the 6th 130.000 tons of shippingwas reported in Rabaul harbour.Black Sea.10. During the period the 1st to 7th October, Russian aircraft sank a1.500-ton ship, four minesweepers and a large number of landing craft andbarges in the Kerch Strait.On the 30th September a 1,300-ton ship, three barges and six motor launcheswere sunk at Genichesk, Sea of Azov.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. Sixteen attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week.Fourteen of these were by aircraft and two by surface ships. On the 8th H.M.S.Mahratia (destroyer) when-450 miles N.W. of Finisterre picked up six survivorsof a Halifax, who stated their aircraft had attacked and sunk a U-boat on the27th September.   The Flalifax was shot clown during the attack.Aircraft from Iceland (C) and the U.K., escorting a homeward bound convoyin mid-Atlantic, sank three U-boats on the 8th.Two U-boats were sunk and one probably sunk in mid-Atlantic by aircraftfrom the U.S.S. Card on the 12th.Shore batteries on Spitzbergen fired at a U-boat on the 9th.[26249]
Enemy Intelligence.German.12. Photographic reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 7th showed Liitzow,Scheer, Enid en, Niirnberg. Prinz Eugen, Leipzig, Schleswig-Holstein, Schlesienand the dismantled Gneisenau. Phis was the largest concentration of Germanheavy ships that had been seen for a very long time. The Koln was seen at Kiel onthe 9th.Italian.13. The captain of the Italia (ex-Littorio) reports that the cruisers Goriziaand Bolzano, which lay under repair at Spezia at the time of the armistice wereso extensively sabotaged by the Italians before the fleet left harbour that they arenot likely to be worth repairing.Of the eight Italian submarines known to have been based at Bordeaux, twoare thought to be still there; two left in May or June, and riiay have been sunk inthe Atlantic; three have arrived in the Far Fast and the Cagni surrendered atDurban.The following Italian warships are known to have been under constructionin Italian ports now occupied by the enemy : at Trieste the battleship Impero isunlikely to be ready till March or April 1944; at Ancona one Regolo-cl&amp;ss cruisermay be nearly ready, and in addition four destroyers, twelve torpedo-boats andfive submarines, of which two are fitting out. At Genoa two liners and a Regolo-class cruiser are being converted for use as aircraft-carriers; of these the cruiseris thought to be half-finished and the liner Aquileia (ex-Roma) nearly ready.U-Boats.14. During the week about 15 U-boats were operating in the vicinity of ahomeward-bound convoy in mid-Atlantic.Since attacks on convoys were renewed in mid-September it is estimated that30 per cent, of the U-boats employed have been sunk.U-boats are known to be in the vicinity of the Azores but so far have notinterfered with our landing operations.A small force of German and a few Japanese U-boats are operating betweenAden, the Persian Gulf and India.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15. During the week U-boats are reported to have torpedoed and sunkthree ships. One ship in a homeward bound convoy was sunk in the N.W.Approaches, one ship in local convoy was sunk west of Cochin and one ship wassunk in the Gulf of Aden. Two ships were mined in the approaches to Tarantobut reached port.16: The August figure of 118,000 tons was later reduced to 102,000 tonsowing to the deletion of two ships incorrectly reported as sunk. Thus the figurefor September of 113,000 tons is slightly higher than for August. Fourteen ships(89.000 tons) were sunk by U-boats, three ships (21,000 tons) by aircraft and oneship (2,000 tons) by mine. Eight ships (49,000 tons) were sunk in the Atlantic,four ships (26,000 tons) in the Indian Ocean and six ships (37.000 tons) in theMediterranean.   Marine risks accounted for 21.000 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During the week ending the 10th. 955 ships were convoyed. Of these326 ships were in ocean convoys and 629 in British coastal convoys. One cruiser,56 destroyers (including one U.S. destroyer) and 109 sloops, cutters, frigates andcorvettes (including one French sloop and four U.S. cutters) were employed onescort duties.Three ocean convoys consisting of 97 ships arrived in Home Waterswithout loss.During September, 17 ocean convoys of 710 ships arrived in the UnitedKingdom without loss and one convoy, originally of six ships, lost one by aircraftattack. Twelve outward bound convoys of 45.6 ships reached their destinationwithout loss and one convoy, originally of 27 ships, lost one before arrival.
A further five ships were lost, during the month, by U-boat attacks on anoutward bound convoy still at sea at the end of the month.In the Western Atlantic and Caribbean 1,576 ships were safely convoyed in154 convoys.British Minelaying.18. Minelaying was carried out by surface craft in the Channel and byaircraft off the Biscay ports, the German North Sea coast and in the Baltic.Enemy Minelaying, British Mines weeping.19. On two nights of the week enemy aircraft probably laid mines off theEast Coast, and E-boats are suspected of minelaying off the East Coast and theLizard.Five mines have been destroyed off the East Coast and a fewT in the Channeland Lyme Bay.Mine totals are : 4,503 ground and 3,370 moored.Enemy minelaying has possibly taken place off St. Johns, N.F., in the Gulfof St. Lawrence and in the Caribbean Sea off the Panama Canal entrance.20. A survey of enemy minelaying in 1941-1943 shows that the scale ofmining by aircraft has considerably decreased during the latter half of the period.An increased use is being made of E-boats, which are able to lay the same typeof mine in the War Channels with greater accuracy.The magnetic-acoustic mine, first introduced about September 1941, continuesto be used, though with certain modifications. It is thought that the purelyacoustic mine is no longer used in any quantity. Two new types of mooredmagnetic mine have been found, one of which can be laid either by U-boat orsurface craft.The offensive laying of small moored contact mines from E-boats has beenintroduced, and large numbers have been destroyed on the convoy routes alongthe South Coast.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. The Norwegian service is now Germany&apos;s heaviest shipping commitment.During the past year 1,500,000 tons of shipping have been identified as tradingbetween greater Germany and Norway and along the Norwegian coast. Of these56,000 tons are permanently engaged in the carriage of military maintenancestores. Another 140,000 tons are estimated to be permanently engaged on routinemovements of personnel. German imports from and exports to Norway (exclusiveof consumer goods) are estimated at 7,400,000 tons for the current year. To liftthis amount 600,000 tons of shipping are permanently employed. The cargoespassing from Norway to Germany are of relatively greater importance toGermany than any cargoes elsewhere in northern waters; such Norwegiancontributions as copper concentrates, nickel, molybdenum, fish and fish productsall correspond to serious German deficiencies, and there is no question that, tonfor ton, these are the most vital shipments in the whole area. The recent with-drawal of Swedish transit facilities will probably result in the continuousemployment of about 60,000 additional tons of shipping. The aggregate ofGermany&apos;s exports in bulk cargoes to Norway (inclusive of military stores), andof Norway&apos;s exports to Germany during the current year is estimated at7,400,000 tons. This is approximately a quarter of Germany&apos;s total figure(29 million tons) for overseas trade in northern wraters. This trade is thoughtto be distributed as follows : Exports from Nortvay  Tons.To German North Sea Ports       .........      3.250,000*To German Baltic Ports............. 700,000To Sweden.................. 250,0004,200,000* Inclusive of 2 million tons of Swedish iron ore shipped from Narvik.[26249] B 2

The Italian tanker Olterra, which was scuttled in June 1940 atAlgeciras, has now been towed to Gibraltar.The Italian s.s. Luana (1.140 tons) was found abandoned off the east coast ofSicily and has been brought into Augusta.Spanish Intelligence.23. The Spanish authorities have interned the crew of the German U-boatwhich is aground at Melilla; similar procedure is to be followed in respect of theU-boat which is now at Vigo.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Leningrad Sector.24. There has been fighting of a local nature in this sector. The captureby the Russians on.the 7th of the railway junction of Kirishi. 65 miles south-eastof Leningrad, was the first Russian progress since the Russians launched theirsummer offensive.Velikie Luki Sector.25. A surprise offensive by the Russians broke through strong Germandefences on a 15-mile front, and led to the capture of Nevel on the 7th. l^heRussians have thus cut the important lateral railway running south from Lenin-grad and threaten the flank of the Vitebsk-Orsha position which the Germans arefortifying and probably intend to hold.Vitebsk-Gomel Sector.26. The Russians have made good progress westwards towards the railwayVitebsk-Orsha and are now within 20 miles of Vitebsk.At the southern end of this sector the Russians have cleared the western bankof the River Soj and captured a railway junction on the outskirts of Gomel.Gomel-Zaporozhe.27. The Russians have now announced that they hold three bridgeheadsacross the Dnieper. On the 8th the dimensions of these bridgeheads were asfollows :  (a) In the area of the Pripet Confluence, 50 miles north of Kiev, a bridgehead19 miles wide and 16 miles deep.(b) 55 miles southeast of Kiev a bridgehead enclosed by the northern loop ofthe river.(c) Southeast of Kremenchug, a shallow strip 12 miles long.Zaporozhe-Melitopol Sector.28. Since the 9th the Germans have reported Russian attacks on this sector.The Russians have, however, not yet referred to anything more than intensifiedreconnaissance activity.Taman Bridgehead.29. The German evacuation of the Peninsula under Russian pressure wascompleted on the 9th. This will release at least half a dozen German divisionsfor use in the Crimea and the Melitopol area, but will also release probably largerHussian forces for use elsewhere.
Summary:\ 30. Although the Russian advance this week has not been so spectacular, theadvance which resulted in the capture of Nevel may, if continued, force theGermans to withdraw in the north to the line Nava-Lake Peipus. The Russiansapear to be confident that they can hold and even extend their bridgeheads acrossthe Dnieper.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Eighth A rmy. -31. The German counter-attack on the right flank of the Eighth Armybetween Termoli and Larino, which earlier last week had caused our troops tomake a slight withdrawal, had by the 7th lost its force. The advance of theCanadians south of Larino further strengthened our positions inland and wewere able to resume the offensive. Our infantry are now approaching Petacciatoon: the East Coast and have crossed the Biferno River at several points, whilein Central Italy the Canadians have captured Gildone and occupied San Croce ontheir left flank. Progress on the Eighth Army front has become somewhat slowerin face of increasing German resistance.Fifth Army.32. In the Fifth Army sector, U.S. forces on the right flank after beingtemporarily held up by blown bridges north of Benevento have during the pastweek made appreciable progress. They captured Pontelandolfo on the 10th, whilefurther inland they pushed forward to the line of the Calore and Volturno Rivers.Further west British infantry and tanks patrolled the line of the Volturno fromCapua to the sea preparatory to launching an attack in force. Heavy rain alongthe whole front hampered operations and made any movement of vehicles off theroads almost impossible.On the night of the 12th/13th. the Fifth Army launched an attack fromGuardia to the sea. No detailed information has yet been received as to itsprogress, but the general situation, was on the 13th, described as satisfactory.Enemy opposition in the U.S. sector was not great and a considerable advancehas been made on their right flank, while in the centre and on their left they havegot the bulk of their forces across the Calore River and across the Volturno, eastof Capua. In the British sector the Germans offered much fiercer resistance andput in a strong counter-attack just before zero hour against our infantry in theCapua area with the result that our attack in that region was not initiallysuccessful. In the centre our armour was able to push a small force over theriver, while on the left the infantry successfully crossed the river and gained theirfirst objective. In this they were assisted by two squadrons of tanks which werelanded from the sea north of the Volturno.Summary.33. After the capture of Naples and our advance to the Volturno River itwas necessary to call a short halt while our forces were being reorganised andsupplies brought up. Progress has been made by our salvage units in clearing thequays and the port. The railway line to the dumps has been opened and therailway system between Salerno and Naples, to which extensive damage was done,is now being repaired. In the east good progress has been made at the &quot; HeelPorts &quot; and it will shortly be possible for the whole of the Eighth Army&apos;s mainten-ance to be carried out through these ports, although for the time being the portsand railways in Calabria are still handling a large part of their supplies. Theadministrative situation in Italy continues, on the whole, to be satisfactory,although it is bound to be difficult and complicated until the build-up of adminis-trative units has been increased in proportion to the size of the fightingformations.    &amp;Eastern Mediterranean.34. Since their occupation of Kos on the 3rd, the Germans have been pre-paring for the attack of Leros. On the 10th an invasion fleet was sighted in thewaters surrounding Kos and Kalymnos, and it is thought that only bad weatherhas prevented the assault taking place so far. The island of Kalymnos wasoccupied by the Germans on the 6th/7th and they have sited guns on thenorthern coast some three miles from Leros.
Symi was attacked by a small force of 80 Germans on the 7th. This attackwas driven off by the British and Italian troops, but the garrison has subsequentlybeen evacuated after heavy dive-bombing attacks.The Germans have also occupied the island of Paros without any oppositionfrom the Italian garrison. Our hold on Kastellorizo has been strengthened asit is being used as a base for supplies and maintenance.Burma.A rakan.35. A British patrol successfully ambushed one hundred Japanese half amile north of Maungdaw, killing 24 of them and suffering only slight casualties.The Japanese are still holding a defensive line based on the MJaungdaw-Buthidaung road and including the east bank of the Kalapanzin River. Theirintention appears to be defensive, and reports of Japanese coast-watching andthe disposition of Japanese troops along the lines of communication may indicatethat they fear a British landing from the sea.Chin Hills.36. Japanese advanced elements have moved into the hills some 20 milessouth of Fort White and have driven back our forward levy posts. On the 9th aJapanese force, estimated at two companies, supported by guns and mortars,launched two attacks against our positions at Dolluang, 10 miles north-east ofFort White. Both attacks were repulsed with casualties to the enemy, while ourforces suffered no loss. The next day our garrison at Dolluang withdrew topositions one mile to the north-west.   The situation in this area is now quiet.New Guinea.37. Remnants of the Japanese garrison of Finschhafen are being pursuednorthwards by Australian patrols. A pocket of Japanese resistance near Satel-berg, about five miles west of Finschhafen. is being vigorously attacked, and about400 Japanese have been killed.The Australians advancing along the coast from Lae have now made contactwith the force which captured Finschhafen.Mopping up continues about three miles north of Lae.In the Ramu Valley Australian forces advanced rapidly to Dumpu. 50 milessouth of Madang. meeting little opposition. On the 13th they are reported tohave inflicted appreciable losses on the enemy whilst driving them from positionsin the Uria River Valley, some 45 miles south of Madang. The advance continuestowards Bogadjim on the coast.Solomons.38. On the 9th the Japanese admitted that they had evacuatedKolombangara and Vella Lavella. On the 6th Vila airfield in the south ofKolombangara was occupied by U.S. troops. Ten wrecked aircraft and muchabandoned arms and equipment were captured.The south-eastern part of Choiseul Island (north-west of the New GeorgisGroup) is also reported clear of Japanese.China.39. Japanese troops estimated at a maximum strength of one division areoperating on the borders of Chekiang and Anhwei provinces in Central China.Their object may be to mop up Chinese guerillas and to seize or destroy the crops.AIR SITUATION.General Review.40. U.S. heavy bombers successfully attacked a number of targets inGermany and aircraft of Bomber Command operated in force against Stuttgartand Hanover.Heavy attacks were made on airfields in Greece, Crete and Rhodes; enemyaircraft made intensive attacks on Leros.A highly successful raid was made on shipping and airfields at Rabaul(New Britain).
United Kingdom.41. In daylight, no enemy aircraft were reported overland. On the nightof the 7th/8th, some 75 long-range bombers operated against this country, about60 of which made landfall at various points on the East and South-East coasts,15 penetrating the London area; three enemy bombers were destroyed and afurther three damaged. During the remainder of the week, a further eight-enemy aircraft operated overland, three of which were destroyed by Mosquitoes.Home Waters.42. Only three attacks were made on enemy shipping and these resultedin the destruction of a launch and a sailing barge, and damage to a flak shipand an escort vessel.Operations by Spitfires, south-west of the Scillies, resulted in a number ofcombats in which six Me. 110 and one Ju. 88 were destroyed for the loss of twoSpitfires. In addition, a Do. 24 and a Ju. 88 were destroyed off Holland and inthe Bay of Biscay respectively.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 96 were despatched, laid 251 sea-mines in enemy waters; four of our aircraft are missing and a fifth crashedin this country.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.43. Heavy bombers of the U.S. Vlllth Bomber Command operated on threedays of the Aveek against the following targets : Date.

The attack on the FockeWulf fighter assembly plant at Marienburg Avas probably the most successfulof its kind yet deliArered, only a small minority of the H.E. bombs failing to hitthe target; the plant, which assembled about 50 per cent, of the F.W. 190production, is virtually devastated. At Minister, which was attacked in threephases, bombs hit the target in three concentrated and well-defined areas crossingthe heart of the city from west to east. Part of the force detailed on Munsterattacked, as alternative targets, Coesfeld (West of Minister) and Enschecle; atthe former, on which 144 tons were dropped, photographs show a heavy concen-tration of bursts in the business and residential area and a number of hits on
the railway tracks and probably on the station. No photographic evidence is yetavailable of the attack on Bremen.In the above operations, in which 48 squadrons of Thunderbolts (P. 47)co-operated, heavy enemy fighter opposition was encountered; the bombersdestroyed 302 enemy aircraft&quot; probably destroyed 89 and damaged 67, and theThunderbolts (P. 47). of which four are missing, destroyed a further 33 plus threeprobables and 17 damaged.Operations over France and the Low Countries were hampered ,by fog,particularly in the latter part of the week. Escorted, medium and light bombers,without loss, made three attacks on airfields, dropping a total of 141 tons onBrest/Lanveoc, Woensdrecht and Morlaix. Four Mosquitoes, out of 24despatched, are missing from an attempt to attack a target near Metz whichwas obscured by cloud. Small-scale attacks, by fighters, on transport targetsresulted in damage to 11 locomotives.Night. j44. Aircraft of Bomber Command, whose scale of operations was alsoaffected by bad weather, made two heavy raids on Stuttgart and Hanoverrespectively. The former was attacked on the night of the 7th/8th by 308 aircraftwhich dropped 1.222 tons of bombs; the attack would appear to have developedin two areas about eight miles apart but observation was handicapped by a thinlayer of cloud over the target. An immediate interpretation from photographs,taken subsequently, is referred to in Appendix VII. On the same night, a small-scale attack was made on the light metal and casting works at Friedrichshafenfrom which no definite results were seen. The attack on Hanover, which wasmade on the night of the 8th/9th. was successful; 430 aircraft dropped 1.667 tonsin good weather conditions and photographs, taken on the 11th, show a devastatedarea of about 1.000 acres with several fires still burning (see Appendix VII).Results from a diversionary attack, by 104 aircraft, on Bremen, could not beobserved owing to cloud.From the above operations, which involved the despatch of 981 aircraft, 33bombers are missing and a further three crashed; two enemy aircraft weredestroyed.Mosquitoes, of which 48 were despatched, attacked without loss a number oftargets in Germany, including Munich, Emden, Castrop Rauxel, Berlin, Cologneand Duisburg.Italy.45.   Bad weather has severely curtailed operations during the week.Over 1.000 offensive sorties were flown by Kittyhawks (P. 40) and Warhawks(P. 40F). Road transport was successfully bombed and machine-gunned andnearly 500 vehicles were either destroyed or damaged. These attacks wereprincipally made in a wide area north-west of Termoli and extended as far northas Pescara, where the railway station and rolling-stock were also attacked.Several trains were severely damaged in the Capua/Cassino area and atCercemaggiore (43 miles W. of Foggia). During these operations six of ouraircraft were lost. Spitfires flew patrols over the battle area but very few enemyaircraft were sighted; one Do. 217 was shot down.Light and medium bombers flew over 300 sorties against road and railwaycommunications, and at night Wellingtons flew a further 113 sorties in attackson similar targets. One of the heaviest attacks was made by Marauders (B. 26)on Mignano (24 miles E.N.E. of Gaeta), where 86 tons of bombs were dropped;reconnaissance later showed that 1  miles of railway line was blocked. Anotherheavy attack was made by 52 Wellingtons, 97 tons of bombs being dropped on thecoast road at Terracina. As a result of successful attacks on Formia the mainrailway lines were blocked and much damage was done to the station buildingsand railway stock. Only one bomber is missing from these operations and threecrash-landed.Fifty-one Wellingtons made a night attack on Grosseto airfield and many hitswere made on buildings, hangars, oil dumps and dispersed aircraft. A largeexplosion was caused in a hangar and a number of aircraft were seen on fire.Fifty-four Fortresses (B. 17) dropped 126 tons of bombs on the railway centreat Mestre (eight miles N.W. of Venice); considerable damage was done to rolling-stock, goods sheds, repair shops and industrial buildings. The Fortresses (B. 17).two of which are missing, destroyed 13 enemy fighters.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week :  Germany.Frankfurt. Damage seen on photographs taken after the attack on the4th/5th October is confined to the east half of the town, on both sides of theriver, involving the Old Town; Bornheim, Rieder Wald, Sachsenhausen,Oberrad, Offenbach, Seckbach and around the east harbour. The greatestdamage is in the last-named area, where fires have left only a few buildingsstanding, and at the time of photography, the third day after the attack, wereseen to be still burning amongst the fuel, dumps and ruins. The following areamongst the industrial premises destroyed or severely damaged :  Voigt u. Haeffner A.G. (engineering).Frankfurter Muelenwerke (flour mill).Ludwig Mayor S.A.A. (engineering).Scbade u, Fuellgruhe A.G. (foodstore).Lorch-Schmidt u. Co., G.m.b.FI. (engineering).East Railway Station.Meuser u. Co. (lathes), Rieder Wald.Walther u. Co: (engineering), Oberrad.Voltohm Seil u. Kabelwerke (cables). Sachsenhausen.In addition, the market hall and the town hall have both been severely damaged.An immediate interpretation of photographs taken about 1-J hours after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 4th October is hampered by the flames and smoke offires blazing in the works of the Vereinigte Deutsche Metalwerke A.G. in thesuburb of Heddernheim. These works (Priority 1 -f- target), producing bronzeand light metal alloys, aircraft wheels, and variable pitch airscrews, have beenheavily damaged and many of the shops have suffered severely. There is somedamage to property, mainly residential, in Heddernheim and in the neighbouringsuburb of Fschersheim.Mannheim. A final interpretation of photographs taken after the attack onthe 23rd 24th September shows that in all 55 factories and industrial concernswere damaged, the greater number of these being concerned with the importationof timber and grain. Nearly 50 warehouses or store sheds in the docks have beendestroyed by fire. In the central goods depot at Mulhau Hafen a number ofrailwav goods sheds have been destroyed, and customs sheds, rolling stock andtracks have all been moi-e or less severely damaged.The Kaiser Wilhelm barracks, and another large barracks and M/T depotat Wallstadt have been hit, and about 72 huts adjoining the I.G. Farben Worksat Ludwigshafen have been destroyed by fire.It is estimated that as a result of this and previous raids, 59 per cent, ofproperty in the fully built-up areas has now been destroyed or damaged.Hamburg. By the end of September, Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard was workingagain at 50 per cent, of its pre-raid capacity. The Stulcken shipyard was stillwholly inactive. A long report concerning the methods of working atBlohm &amp; Voss states that most of the steel plates for submarines came fromKrupps at Essen but some also from Krefeld and other places in the Ruhr.From time to time there have been serious delays in the shops owing to thenon-delivery of steel plates, and in June 1943 the night shift from 2200&quot;hours to0200 hours was laid off owing to the shortage. Failure in delivery in early Julyresulted in the three shops in which the plates are riveted working only tenhours in the 24 and just before attacks began this had been reduced to eighthours. After the attacks riveting stopped completely and had not recommencedby the 18th August.Hanover. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the11th October, after the attack on 8th/9th October, shows that the central andold town, over an area of approximately 1,000 acres, has been almost completely
devastated by fire. Some buildings in this part of the city were still burningnearly three days after the attack. From the central town the destructionextends mainly to the west and south.Damage to industrial and commercial buildings is heavy and includes : Hanomag : gun carriages, tractors, lorries, &amp;c. (priority 1).Wollwascherei : wool combers (priority 1 + ).Elektrowerk Hannover : electrical engineers.Reinhold &amp; Co. : insulating material.M.ain Passenger Station.Main Town Gas Works.Many civic and public buildings as well as goods depots and railway sidingshave been damaged.Marienburg. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the10th October, after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 9th October, shows that thedamage to the Focke Wulf Aircraft Assembly Plant is so severe and concentratedthat the works are entirely devastated. Only one of the large buildings remainsintact and that has been damaged. Piles of stores have been smashed andscattered, and a number of aircraft damaged in varying degree are lying amongthe debris.Miinster. -An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the11th October shows that, as a result of the U.S.A.A.E. daylight attack on the10th October, damage, mainly business and residential, is confined almostentirely to the centre and eastern part of the town where at least eight fires werestill burning over 24 hours after the attack. The main railway station hasreceived a direct hit.A nklam. Severe damage is seen at the Arado components factory in whichseveral buildings were still burning fiercely, two workshops being among thebuildings still on fire.Further photographs show additional damage caused by the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 9th October. Two large workshops, previously reported on fire, havebeen almost completely destroyed and the office buildings have been gutted.Considerable damage has been caused to business and residential property.Gdynia.
