(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HI3 BRITANNIC MAJE3TY&apos;5 GOVT.)^SECRET1st November 1945 WAR CABINET Copy No. S3CANADIAN GIFT OF WHEAT TO INDIAMemorandum by the secretary of state lor India,The Canadian Government, in a telegram from the Canadianprime Minister to the viceroy dated 24th October, made thefollowing offer:&quot;The Government and people of Canada desire to do what theycan to help&apos;alleviate the Indian famine and to this end areprepared to give the Government of India up to 100,000 tonsof wheat, provided that it may be found practicable toarrange for the shipment of this wheat from Western Canadianports.   Under the procedure of the Canadian Mutual Aid Act,by which such a gift could be effective, an application forassistance should be received from the Government to whichthe goods are to be transferred,   a formal application forassistance in this sense will, I may assure you, receive theimmediate and most sympathetic consideration of the CanadianGovernment.&quot;May I avail myself of this communication to extend to youmy warmest good wishes on your assumption of the great officeof honour and trust to which you have been appointed.   Vitalinterests of the commonwealth and jf the United Nations areidentified with the successful discharge of your duties andyou may count on whatever co-operation and assistance Canadacan give in carrying them out.&quot;The text of this message was communicated to me by theHigh commissioner for Canada on the 25th October -and on thefollowing morning I received a telegram from the Viceroysaying that he had replied to the Canadian Government acccpt-ing the-offor with deep gratitude.   The Viceroy added thatthe Government of India would make a formal application asdesired by the Canadian Government and would endeavour tosecure the necessary shipping from His Majesty&apos;s Government.He added that India would be deeply touched by Canada&apos;ssympathy and that he w raid like, if the Canadian Governmenthad no objection, to communicato&apos; the offer to the pressin India.Knowing that there v/as likely to be difficulty aboutshipping,&quot;T at once telegraphed to the Viceroy asking him todefer publicity while the position was explored.   Afterconsultation with the Ministry of War Transport I telegraphedagain to the viceroy to say that there was no hope of shippingfor anything like the full 100,000 tons from North America,even over a long period, that loadings from the west coast  j Canada are particularly difficult and that the most thatcould be hoped for was a few shiploads from the east coastif the Canadian Government could move wheat there.Subsequently the Minister of Wear Transport informed me thathe would not favour shipping any of this wheat from Canadato India, since if shipping were to be provided there werenearer sources of&apos;supply.I feel that a most difficult situation will arise ifthe Canadian Government publish this offer and we have toinform the Government of India that the wheat cannot be
shipped ana probably have to make an announcement to thateffect.   At the same time, I appreciate the force of theMinister of War Transport&apos;s objections to arranging ship-merits from North America^  The question therefore ariseswhether we should press the Canadian Government to refrainfrom publication.I understand from the High commissioner for Canadathat the Canadian- Government have already given a statementon this subject to the Press but have not yet released itfor publication.    They would not be willing to defer public-ation for more than a few days from last Sunday.1 should myself be most reluctant to see this generousoffer brought to nothing and I feel that all possible meansof giving at any rate some effect to it should be explored.
