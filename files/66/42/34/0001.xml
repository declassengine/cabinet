THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRETW.P. (43) 484.27th October, 1943.WAR CABINET.PUBLICITY CONCERNING JAPANESE TREATMENT OF BRITISHPRISONERS OF WAR - AND CIVILIAN INTERNEES. &apos;Memorandum by the Minister of State. .I circulate herewith a Memorandum on the above subject which has beenprepared in the Foreign Office. -R. K. LForeign Office, 27th October, 1943.PUBLICITY CONCERNING  JAPANESE TREATMENT OF BRITISHPRISONERS OF WAR AND CIVILIAN INTERNEES.In a memorandum dated the 21st October (W.P. (43) 471) concerning thetreatment by the Japanese of British prisoners of war in Siam the Secretary ofState for War advocates making the facts public. In addition, the Commander1in-Chief, India, in a telegram, of which a copy is attached as Annex I, hasurged that an internal anti-Japanese campaign should be undertaken in Indiabased on information concerning Japanese treatment of prisoners. These papersraise the question whether an Empire-wide campaign of disclosures relating toprisoners of war and civilian internees in Japanese hands should not be launchedin concert with the United States.2. We must consider the effect of such a campaign not only on our ownpublic, but also on the Japanese. The British public are, of course, entitled toinformation and are already beginning to press for it. But the overridingconsideration must be that the weapon of publicity should be used in such amanner and at such a moment as to achieve an improvement in the lot of ourprisoners.Present Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. A mass of material concerning the treatment of civilians has already beencompiled by a Foreign Office Committee presided over by Lord Clauson, and muchmaterial has been collected about prisoners of war from reports by the ProtectingPower, from statements by escaped prisoners and in other ways. But hithertothe only substantial statement made by His Majesty,&apos;s Government was that madeby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons inMarch 1942 concerning the Hong Kong atrocities. This of course excitedstrong resentment in Japanese official quarters, but we have some reason to thinkthat it may have brought about a slight improvement in the treatment ofprisoners. The United States Government have also made only one officialstatement of substance, namely, that relating to the execution of United Statesairmen who fell into Japanese hands after the raid on Tokyo. Mr. Grew, formerUnited States Ambassador in. Tokyo, made in addition some statements on thetreatment of civilians. But both Governments have made a number of officialprotests to the Japanese Government through the Swiss Government as the12182   [26308]Copy No-
Protecting Power. To these protests the replies have mostly been evasiveprevaricating and cynical. But it is impossible to say with any certainty that theJapanese have taken steps to improve matters as the Japanese Government refuseto allow the representatives of the Protecting Power to visit prisoners, exceptin Japan, Korea, Shanghai and Hong Kong, where a minority of the prisonersare confined.4. It has been the view of those who have expert knowledge of Japan thatup till now the prospects of influencing favourably Japanese behaviour towardsour prisoners by means of publicity were very small. The Japanese military arenot particularly sensitive to the good opinion of the world, and those Japanesewho are sensitive on the point exercise little or no authority over them.Furthermore, so long as Japan wras winning and consolidating great victoriesthere was little apprehension on the part of the military that a day of reckoningw-ould come. Publicity was therefore likely to do no good and might well doharm (a) by stimulating the army, gendarmerie and police to still further brutalityagainst prisoners; (b) by prejudicing the exchanges of civilians (1,600 wereexchanged last year and it is hoped shortly to exchange another 1,600); and(c) (so far as the British public was concerned) by causing gratuitous distressto relatives of those still in Japanese hands.5. Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government have felt justified since the lastcivilian exchange in relaxing such restraint as they were at first able to exerciseon disclosures by private individuals concerning their own experiences, and aand a number of these have appeared in the press, in books and on the wireless.The public have in this way gained some inkling of what is happening and mayvery likely ask for more before long.Arguments for and against early publicity.6. The arguments for early publicity are strong ones. From the point ofview of political warfare and the effect on the Japanese, it can be argued withsome force that the turn of the tide against Japan and her allies is now sufficientlymarked to cause the Japanese (even the military) to consider that a policy of&apos;&apos; frightfulness ;; against prisoners in their power may recoil on them at the closeof the war. From the point of view of the effect on the British public, and apartfrom the obligation on Flis Majesty&apos;s Government to satisfy legitimate enquiry,it is very desirable to bring home to everyone in this country the terrible natureof the Japanese enemy, to stimulate greater interest in the Far Eastern war, andto rouse our people to a fuller determination to defeat Japan.7. As against these considerations there is little doubt that the fullest effectfrom both points of view would be obtained if publicity were delayed until theeve of a major offensive in the Far East. Also, the exchange of civilians due totake place in one or two months might be prejudiced if the campaign werelaunched before the exchange had been completed. These considerations are atleast of some importance in timing the campaign.An interim proposal.8. Once publicity has been used it will leave no further weapons in ourhands with which to try to force the Japanese into remedying those things ofwhich we complain. Furthermore, this weapon becomes blunt with usage. Wemust therefore consider whether before proceeding to systematic disclosures thereis any other course open to us. It is probable that the United States Governmentcould be persuaded to make with His Majesty&apos;s Governments a joint or parallelremonstrance to the Japanese Government demanding better treatment and theright of visits by the representatives of the Protecting Power to all prisoners,coupled with a veiled intimation that otherwise Japanese misdeeds will be fullypublicised. * It might be well also to associate the Netherlands and other AlliedGovernments with this action. The communication would have to be carefullyphrased to leave us the maximum freedom to use publicity at any time, even ifthe Japanese make some ostensible attempt to meet our requirements. An outlineof the proposed communication is attached as Annex II.9. This procedure has the disadvantage that it would give the JapaneseGovernment an opportunity to forestall our campaign with a campaign of theirown, in which we may be sure that full use would be made of the shooting by
3J1the New Zealand authorities of 40 Japanese prisoners of war in a riot in a.camp at Featherstone.Recommendations.10.   Talcing all the factors above mentioned into account, it is recommended (i) that a campaign of disclosures should soon be undertaken regardlessof military plans;(ii) that (to allow the civilian exchange to be completed) this should notbegin till, say, the [middle/end] of-January next;11 (iii) that prior consultations should be set on foot with the Governmentsof the Dominions, India, the United States, and other Allies(especially the Dutch) having prisoners in Japanese hands;(iv) that meanwhile, jointly with the other interested Governments, con-sideration be given to the advisability of a communication to theJapanese Government covering both prisoners of war and civilians,demanding early remedy of the present position and permission forthe representatives of the Protecting Power to visit all prisoners.A. C.22nd October, 1943     . .-&apos;ANNEX I.Commander-in-Chief, India, to the War Office, 15th October.(77969/1.)For C.I.G.S. from General Auchinleck : -1. Reuter message from London, dated 10th October, quotes Howard Vyseas stating not single case of atrocities in prisoners-of-war camps in Japan andgiving relatively satisfactory account of conditions. While realising remarks&quot;were confined to Japan itself and did not refer to camps outside Japan, Iconsider general impression conveyed is very far from truth and definitelymisleading, especially as. only very small proportion Allied prisoners held inJapan itself. In any case, it contrasts with American publicity regarding murderof American airmen in Japan.2. I do not understand this policy of whitewashing Japan and concealingtruth re barbarism of Japanese. There are good grounds for belief that exposureof Jap shortcomings is best and quickest way to effect improvement owing to Japsensitiveness to world opinion. By maintaining picture that all is well we aremerely encouraging them to continue their present policy. I would urge, in anycase, that need to develop anti-Jap feeling among civil population and our armed,forces far outweighs considerations for feelings of relatives of prisoners of war,which I understand is main argument advanced for our present policy of silence.I doubt also whether effect on relatives would be to lower morale.3. Recently, representative Indians, including princes and Indian officers,have expressed to me their bewilderment at our silence on Jap beastliness andask what is our motive withholding information from public. They press forrobust propaganda exposing Japs, and do not anticipate any adverse effects fromsuch publicity on public or military morale. Leader in Indian newspaperrecently remarked that Japs could not be so bad after all, as there was no infor-mation about ill-treatment of population in occupied countries such as waspublished about Germans.4. After discussion with Viceroy, we have therefore come to conclusion thatattitude to Japan and Japs urgently needs stimulus, which exploitation ofmaterial we have about Jap treatment of both prisoners of war and inhabitantsof occupied territories will provide. We have therefore decided on judiciousinternal anti-Jap propaganda campaign and are stopping publication in Indiaof messages such as that referred to above.
ANNEX II. -MCommunication to the Japanese Government.- His Majesty&apos;s Government have the honour to request the Swiss Governmentto transmit to the Japanese Government on their, behalf the followingcommunication : His Majesty&apos;s Government have to their regret had many occasions to drawthe attention of the Japanese Government to the numerous, and in some cases,systematic, infractions both of the letter and spirit of the Geneva Convention,on the treatment of prisoners of war, and to represent to the Japanese Govern-ment the urgent necessity for early remedy of the highly unsatisfactory positionrevealed by detailed and authentic evidence in the hands of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. The replies of the Japanese Government to these representationshave been evasive and unconvincing; and the reports reaching His Majesty&apos;sGovernment from various sources show that the treatment of prisoners of warand civilian internees, especially in certain of the territories under Japanesecontrol, so far from improving, has been gravely deteriorating. For this stateof affairs the Japanese Government bears a heavy responsibility, and the Britishpublic are becoming aware that the Japanese Governments attitude is not onlyin sharp contradiction with the terms of the Geneva Convention but in some casesis even devoid of the most elementary basis of humanity.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have refrained from publishing in detail theinformation in their hands. This is not due to any desire to withhold from thepeoples of the British Commonwealth the facts of Japanese brutality, but to thebelief and hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that, being informed of the manygrave infractions of the spirit of the Geneva Convention the Japanese Governmentwould remedy these infractions and permit the representatives of the ProtectingPower to assure themselves of the removal of the causes for complaint by regularvisit to all prisoners of war and. civilian internees and inspection of the conditionsin which they are maintained.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government now address this urgent appeal to theJtipanese Government to lose no further time in applying the necessary remediesand in granting without further delay the fullest right of inspection to therepresentatives of the Swiss Government.
