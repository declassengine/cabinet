The second attack was carriedout in good weather conditions and preliminary reports confirmed by nightphotographs indicated that the centre of the city had been heavily hit. Dayphotographs, although much obscured by cloud and smoke, show large fires stillburning and it is clear that much devastation has been caused. This is confirmedby the crews of Mosquitoes engaged on a harassing raid against Berlin on thenight of the 9th/ 10th October, who from a great distance saw fires in Hanoverstill burning fiercely.A detailed assessment of the results is being made and these will be reportedin the next Summary.[26263] b
Bochum (29th/30th September).This attack was made in conditions of good visibility. Fires were seen to bestill burning at a number of points 16 hours after the attack and photographsshow that considerable damage was done. As a result of this and previous raidsa great part of the centre of the city has been gutted and severe damage has beencaused to industrial plants of the highest priority.The most important of these are : Vereinigte Stahlwerke (Bochumer Verein) (Steel) Work Gusstahl-fabrik (see Prints Nos. 1-4). (At least 15 large shops affected.)-Werk Stahlindustrie- Werk Hontrop.Risen u. Huttenwerke A.G. (Steel).Ivrupp Treibstoffwerke G.m.b.FI. (Benzine and tar oils).Gelsenkirchener Bergwerke A.G. Carolinengliiek Colliery.Bergbau A.G. Lothringen President colliery 1/4.Maschinen u. Bahndarf A.G. (Machinery).Fahrzeugwerke Leug. (Lorries).Hagen (lst/2nd October).Hagen, until this attack the largest undamaged town in the Ruhr, has about200.000 inhabitants. It is the main centre for the production of U-boat accumu-lators and contains other important industrial plants. Photographs taken on the3rd October are obscured by the smoke of fires still burning. Damage to industrial,commercial and residential property is, however, seen to be very severe, amiindustries which have been damaged include Accumulatoren-Fabrik A.G., makersof U-boat, batteries, accumulators and fire-control apparatus, a group of factoriesproducing aircraft parts and machine tools, foundries, screw works and a textilefactory.Railway facilities and public buildings have suffered, and there is an areaof devastation in the more densely built-up part of the town.Plant Xo. 5 shows some of the damage.Munich (2nd/3rd October).Preliminary reports indicated that this attack made by a force of Lancasterswas most successful. Photographs taken on the 3rd October cover only a smallpart of the city but show severe damage and fires still burning.Kassel (3rd/4th October).Weather over the target was clear with practically no cloud but some groundhaze. Day photographic cover showed that the main concentration was slightly toofar to the north and east to have caused devastation in the town itself, but thatthere had been severe industrial damage in the outskirts. The high prioritytargets. Fieseler Flugzeugbau (aircraft), Spinnfaser A.G. (textile yarns) andSalzmann &amp; Co. (cloth) were all seriously hit and fourteen other factories werebadly damaged. In three large barracks numerous buildings were destroyed andat one of them a large ammunition dump was hit and completely destroyed. Fireswere still burning at many points on the day after the attack.Prints Nos. 6-9 show some of the damage caused.Frankfurt (4th 5th October).No previous attack on Frankfurt had met with success, but on this occasiongood visibility was experienced over the target and. crews were confident that agood attack had been made. Day cover, which is still incomplete, shows the dockarea round the E. harbour almost completely devastated and that fires werestill burning in the fuel dumps and ruined buildings on the third day after theattack. Among factories destroyed, or severely damaged are engineering works,flour mills and food stores. Housing damage in the eastern half of the mainbuilt-up area is heavy but cannot yet be properly estimated.Stuttgart (7th/8th October).Detailed assessment of the results of this raid is not yet available. Whilesome of the bombing was accurate, heavy concentration was not achieved.Results of Previous Raids.Berlin.A final interpretation of photographs taken after the last three attacks onthe 23rd/24th August, the 31st August/1st September and the 3rcl/4th September
shows that damage is heaviest in the western half of the city, particularly inthe Charlottenburg, Schoneberg, Friedenau and Mariendorf districts. It hasbeen caused mainly by fire, but several large H.E. incidents are seen to bescattered throughout the area.By far the most important damage is to the works of Siemens Halske A.G.and Siemens Schlickertwerke A.G., which together form one of the largestelectrical engineering concerns in Germany. In the latter, 75 per cent, of thebuildings in the electro-chemical department have been burnt out, while in theadjoining electric motor works and in the accessories works there is very severedamage by fire. In Siemens Halske, one-third of the rectifier works has beengutted and some sheds damaged.There has also been severe damage to Klockner Humboldt Deutz., a generalengineering works. The Osram radio valve factory has been partially destroyed,and amongst other damaged plants not previously reported are the LuftschiffbauZeppelin, M.G.H., Textilwerke A.G. (both producing balloon fabric andparachutes), two oil storage depots and a large leather warehouse at Schoneberg.Miinchen-Gladbach and Rheydt.Photographs show that, as a result of the attack on the 30/31st August,both towns have suffered extensive damage caused mainly by fire. In the centreof each, where damage is heaviest, rather more than 50 per cent, of built-upproperty has been destroyed, and in the suburbs about 33 per cent. Over 100small factories, including the Kabelwerke Rheydt, have been damaged, and inmany cases completely destroyed. Gas and electricity works have sufferedseverely.Damage to railway property includes repair shops, a goods shed and theimportant marshalling yard at Rheydt, where several tracks have been cut.Buildings at the three stations of Rheydt, Miilfort and Odenkirchen have beendestroyed and an engine roundhouse near Munchen-Gladbach station has beendamaged.o .....Many public buildings are seen to be destroyed or severely damaged,including the Town Halls of both Munchen-Gladbach and Rheydt.Nuremberg.Photographs show that as a result of the last two attacks on the 10th/11thand 27th/28th August the districts of Wohrd. Garten bei Wohrd and districts tothe N.W. have been severely damaged. Industrial damage is fairly heavy andinvolves five priority targets including the Triumphwerke A.G. (motor cycles), theNeumayerwerke (munitions) and the Press-Stanz und Ziehwerke Rud Chilling-worth A.G. (pressed steel parts for railways and aircraft).The main building and a subsidiary building of the Main Railway Stationas well as the goods depots at the North. South and East Stations and other rail-way property, have been damaged. Serious damage has been caused to the town&apos;selectricity supply offices, to the transformer for current from the power station atGebersdorf and to the Main Post Office.Several military establishments in or near the town have been damaged,including three hutted camps which are seriously affected, as wrell as the localairfield.Mannheim.A final interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the 23rd/24thSeptember shows that in all 55 factories and industrial concerns were damaged,the majority being concerned with the importation of timber and grain. Nearly50 warehouses or store sheds in the docks have been destroyed by fire. In theCentral Goods Depot at Muhlauhafen a number of railway goods sheds have beendestroyed, and customs sheds, rolling stock and tracks have all been more or lessseverely damaged.The Kaiser Wilhelm barracks, and another large barracks and M/T &quot;Depot atWallstadt have been hit, and about 72 huts adjoining the I.G. Farben Works atLudwigshafen have been destroyed by fire.It is estimated that as a result of this and previous raids 59 per cent, ofproperty in the fully built-up areas has now been destroyed or damaged. Thishas been increased by the subsequent attack on the 4th/5th October[26263] B 2
Hamburg.By the end of September Blohm and Voss shipyard was working again at50 per cent, of its pre-raid capacity. The Stiilcken shipyard was still whollyinactive.M unich.Details are now available of the attack on the 6th/7th September which fellon the south of the city.In the Isaar Valley damage was heavy. Travelling by train fromWolfrotshausen into the city it could be seen that hardly a place had escapeddamage to some degree. The stations at Pullach, Hohen Schaftlarn and Thal-kirchcn had all boon hit ; at the last of these, a heavy bomb bad fallen at a moment,when a large number of persons were awaiting a train. Damage to the mainpower station at Thalkirchen and to a sub-station at Pullach were additionalfactors that caused the line between Wolfratshausen and Munich to be closedcompletely for three days. At Grosse Hesselohe the station and the bridgecarrying the Reichsbahn over the river were damaged sufficiently to cause a.complete stoppage of traffic.In Munich itself, the south station was closed to the public for two days whilerepairs were effected. Parts of the big marked hall nearby collapsed from directhits or blast and at the cattle slaughter-house, where damage was severe, therefrigeration plant in about (50 per cent, of the storage houses was destroyed orput out of action.Failure of the population to take shelter considerably increased the casualties.After some months of Mosquito attacks and numerous false alarms, the heavyattack came as a complete surprise.Hanover.A final interpretation of photographs shows that in the attack on the22nd 23rd September 56 factories or industrial premises were damaged. Anoutstanding feature was the extensive dislocation caused to the railways. Damageto tracks was particularly severe in the southern area and the line south throughWiilfel to Hildesheim was closed, not only as a result of this, but also because adirect hit caused the partial collapse of a bridge carrying 4 tracks. The damageto the carriage sidings east of the main station was severe and the carriage shedswere gutted by fire. In addition to the carriages destroyed in the sheds, about50 of those outside were destroyed by H.E. or damaged by fire.France.Montluqon. In the successful attack on the Dunlop tyre factory on the15th/16th September certain unidentified factory premises nearby were alsodamaged. It is now known that one of these was the Cote Rouge factory, maim-facturing naval optical instruments, in which 5 out of ll workshops weredestroyed.A. II. M. S.Air Ministry. 18th October, 1943.
