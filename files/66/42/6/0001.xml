(43) 456.    ,     /V  p j t13th October, 1943.,   . IRELAND.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.WHEN the question of an American approach to the Government of SouthernIreland was last discussed by the Cabinet on the 22nd September [W.M. (43)130th Conclusions, Minute 3], I was not at the Dominions Office. It may there-fore be useful if I put down on paper the conclusions which I have framed onthis question and the reasons which have driven me to those conclusions. Whilewe must all appreciate the considerations which led the United States Ministerat Dublin to put forward his proposal, I believe that the arguments advancedagainst it by my predecessor and the Home Secretary are conclusive. Mr. Gray&apos;sobject was to expose the Irish Government to the American people. Though theostensible purpose of the Presidents approach to Mr. de Valera was to ask himto enter the war-even at this late hour on the Allied side, Mr. Gray assumedthat this purpose would not be achieved. Mr. de Valera would refuse, and, as aresult, would lose that small measure of sympathy in the United States which stillremained to him. But, in fact, he is most unlikely to take so crude a course. It isfar more probable that he would jump at the opportunity of bringing into theforum of Anglo-American relations the very controversial issue of Partition.He would send an answer which made it clear that though he could not bindhimself to abandon neutrality, the situation would be much eased if Partitionwere done away with. Such a reply would be meat and drink to anti-BritishIrish propagandists in the United States. They would make the fullest use of it,and so far from the cause of Anglo-American unity having been furthered, amost dangerous source of friction would be engendered. Not only would therebe considerable resentment among wide sections of opinion in the United Statesagainst what appeared to them to be British pigheadedness, but the British peoplewould be furious at what they would regard as uncalled-for interference by theUnited States in the internal affairs of the British Commonwealth of Nations.I cannot help feeling, therefore, that the dangers which would be likely to becreated by Mr. Gray&apos;s original proposal far outweigh the advantages whichcould possibly flow from it.Moreover, these advantages have in any case been greatly whittled down, ifnot entirely nullified, by the amendments which have since been introduced intothe proposal by the State Department. The chief merit of Mr. Gray&apos;s propositionwas that it constituted a public castigation, by the President of the United States,of Southern Irish neutrality in the war. The Presidents note to Mr. de Valerawas to be published. This essential feature of the proposal has now beeneliminated. It is to be a private communication. What possible advantage canthis achieve in educating American opinion? Moreover, in its present form ithas been so watered down that it hardly amounts to a castigation at all. It hasbecome a gentle, melancholy reproach. In addition, it contains features whichI should have thought were extremely objectionable from our point of view. Itdoes not ask for any naval or air facilities for Great Britain. It is assumed thatthese would, in fact, be granted. But this seems a very rash assumption. Itindeed makes no mention of Great Britain at all. A long account is given of theassistance which the United States has provided for Southern Ireland durino-the war, but not a word is said to draw the Southern Irish Governments attentionto the fact that it is we who have defended Ireland from the Germans, and whohave transported, to Ireland in our convoys the necessities of life without whichthe Irish people would have been reduced to destitution. I must say tfiat I findthis a very bitter pill to swallow. Finally, there is a most surprising passage[26241]
which says that &quot; it is entirely possible that the Irish bases may not be needed.&quot;In that ease, why send the note at all? Whatever merits Mr. Gray&apos;s originaldocument may have had, the present proposal seems to have none, and I greatlyhope that it will be possible to dissuade the President from going further with it.So much for the American approach. But the question still remainswhether the time is ripe for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make anapproach to Mr. de Valera, both for the purpose of bringing Southern Ireland intothe war and of attempting to find some solution of the Partition question. Sofar as our ultimate aim is concerned, I imagine that there is no difference ofview in any quarter. We should all like to see Ireland united, on a basis satis-factory to Southern Ireland, Ulster and Great Britain. The whole problem isone of approach and timing, and it is largely governed by the personality ofMr. de Valera himself. He is the only person who counts in Ireland to-day.Knowing him as I do-and I have had some personal acquaintanceship with himover a period of years both at Geneva and later at Dublin-1, am quite convincedthat for us to make an approach to him would be a cardinal error. He is notonly extremely obstinate, but a somewhat theatrical person. He loves the lime-light, and to cut a figure in the great world. The last four years have been adeep humiliation to him. He sees himself forgotten, he sees it conclusivelyproved that Ireland is entirely dependent on Britain, and that Britain is not atall dependent on Ireland. He has been reduced to a comparatively repeat com-paratively rational frame of mind. But if once we go to him, he will be upon his high horse again, will assume that Ireland is the hub of the universe,and will begin to make impossible conditions. The only hope of reaching asettlement, to my mind, is that a situation should be produced where he has tocome to us. Then we can say to him : we are in no hurry to settle this questionof Partition : it is for you to produce a scheme which safeguards the essentialliberties of Ulster and provides us with those strategic facilities which areessential to us. If we had not had the Northern ports in this war, we should havebeen strangled. It is for you to put forward proposals which will for ever avertthat danger. If we force him into that position, there is a faint chance that hemay produce something practical. Otherwise, I believe that nothing can be doneuntil he dies or retires.This, I would urge on my colleagues, is not a negative policy. It is a realisticpolicy. There is, I would suggest, a definite analogy to be drawn between ourpolicy towards Ireland and towards India. In both, we want to make an advancetowards a united country. In both, what stands in the way is a dominating,intractable, rather anti-British personality. When, last week, a proposal was putforward that we should take the initiative in reopening negotiations with Gandhi,the Cabinet took the view that it would not be wise to do so, that it would merelybring him back into the centre of the stage and increase his potentialities formischief, without increasing the chances of a reasonable settlement, It waspointed out that it was for the Indians to make the first move. If they did, weshould be in an infinitely stronger position to guide the course of events. As Ilistened to the discussion, I felt how powerful were these arguments against rashor precipitate action, and I am perfectly consistent in recommending the samepolicy to the Government in regard to Ireland, as both positive and practical. Ifit be suggested that there is one factor in the Indian situation which has beenabsent in the case of Ireland, the Cripps Mission, I would recall to my colleaguesthe Macdonald Mission in June 1940. It will be remembered that at that timeMr. Macdonald was empowered by His Majesty&apos;s Government to make thefollowing proposals to Mr. de Valera: (i) A declaration to be issued by the United Kingdom Government forth-with accepting the principle of a United Ireland.(ii) A joint body including representatives of the Government of Eire andthe Government of Northern Ireland to be set up at once to work outthe constitutional and other practical details of the Union of Ireland.The United Kingdom Government to give such assistance towards thework of this body as might be desired.(iii) A joint Defence Council representative of Eire and Northern Irelandto be set up immediately.(iv) Eire to enter the war on the side of the United Kingdom and her Alliesforthwith, and, for the purposes of the defence of Eire, the Govern-ment of Eire to invite British naval vessels to have the use of ports in. Eire, and British troops and aeroplanes to co-operate with the Eireforces and to be stationed in such positions in Eire as may be agreedbetween the two Governments.
(v) The Government of Eire to intern all German and Italian aliens in thecountry and to take any. further steps necessary to suppress FifthColumn activities.(vi) The United Kingdom Government to provide military equipment at onceto the Government of Eire.That was at least as good an offer as we should most of us be prepared to maketo Southern Ireland now. All thatlVIr. Macdonald obtained from Mr. de Valerain reply was that he could only contemplate a United Ireland on the basis ofIreland as a whole being neutral. At a later date, when the United States cameinto the war, I was myself sent to Dublin to make a further approach to Mr. deValera. He knows perfectly well that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be readyto negotiate with him on Partition on certain conditions, namely. SouthernIreland&apos;s entry into the war, future safeguards for Ulster and strategic safe-guards for us. But he will not negotiate on conditions. Partition must be broughtto an end first. Then he may not will but may talk to us on the other issueswe wish to raise. Until he moves from this position, there is no basis for anagreement, and it must be for Southern Ireland, I submit, to make the first step inresolving this deadlock, which is of her own creation.If the suggestion is put forward that an unofficial emissary, some mutualfriend, should go over and talk to Mr. de Valera. speaking as for himself, andtry to find out whether there has been any change in his attitude, I can only saythat there have been a number of such emissaries, most of them self-appointed,during the course of this war and they have all come back empty-handed. More-over, there is a real danger that, however carefully wrapped up such a missionmight 1)6, Mr. de Valera would interpret it as an official approach, in which caseit would be open to the objections which I have indicated. If the approach couldbe kept purely unofficial, it could at any rate do no harm, though I should bemisleading the Cabinet if I pretended to be sanguine as to the outcome. Anofficial approach at the present stage would, I am convinced, be likely to be uselessfor the present and harmful for the future, and I would deprecate it as stronglyas I can.C.Dominions Office, \Zth October, 1943.
