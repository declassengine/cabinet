THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1943.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (43) 458.13th October, 1943.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR AGRICULTURAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and the SecretaryDepartment of Overseas Trade.THE last paper on post-war agricultural policy gives ground for satisfaction.By omitting certain premature or controversial proposals contained inW.P. (43) 103, it points the way towards the outline of a policy on which it maybe reasonable to expect a broad measure of agreement.2. The essential basis for this agreement is contained in the sentence in2 (c) : &quot; On social grounds it would appear undesirable to reduce still furtherthis rural and agricultural element in our national life.&quot; It is widely heldthat work on the land and the peculiar kind of skill and intuitive understandingof the ways of nature associated with it engender a point of view and tempera-ment which are a valuable ingredient in our national life. We shun the ideaof total urbanisation; we feel that the nation would be poorer by a great reduc-tion in its complement of agricultural works. And to maintain that complementat a certain level the community would be prepared to make a sacrifice, thoughwhether any sacrifice will be necessary cannot yet be foreseen.3. It is for this human and social purpose that public opinion is likely toendorse a confirmation of the affirmative policy in regard to agriculture con-tained in the announcement of the 26th November, 1940, knowing full well thatin certain circumstances such a policy may impose some burden on the standardof living of the people as a whole. The concession to agriculture implied inthe policy is no less real and generous for not being as rigid as the proposalsof W.P. (43) 103.4. On the other hand, public opinion is not likely to endorse the policyof maintaining all reasonably good land in a state of fertility merely as an endin itself, if this should entail a burden on the standard of living. If the main-tenance of fertility is happily realised as a bye-product of the social policy, welland good. But this professional and technical objective must not be allowed toadd to the cost of social policy.5. In view of the stress justly laid on the human element in the presentpaper, it is to be regretted that the question of small-holdings is relegated to afootnote. If the primary purpose of plans for assisting agriculture is to keepin being a body of sturdy, self-reliant and resourceful workers, there is muchto be said for giving specific encouragement to the small-holder. There is adanger that, even if farm incomes are improved, urban life may still have astronger attraction for the best type of young man and the quality of theagricultural population may progressively deteriorate. On the other hand,agriculture is one of the remaining industries in which the very small unit canstill produce economically; this may serve as a counter-attraction to the manwho values his independence. Men returning from Service may have an appetitefor open-air life, and plans should be made for making land available for themto settle on. Questions of credit supply, marketing reform and a more flexiblesystem of railway freights are relevant to this problem. On the side of outputstress should probably be laid on horticulture and the care of livestock.[26247] b
6. It may be useful to record the more controversial proposals ofW.P. (43) 103, the absence.of which from W.P. (43) 422 gives hope of agree-in en t :(i) Nutritional requirements (paragraph 6) and the maintenance of anagricultural population supplant the maintenance of soil fertility asthe primary objectives.&apos;(ii) The idea of formulating at this stage a specific programme for thequantity of arable acreage, crops and live-stock is abandoned.Recognition is given to the need for waiting to see how internationalfinancial and economic conditions develop after the war (paragraphs 8and 17).(iii) The stated preference for devices, such as levy-subsidies, import quotasand bulk purchase, likely to conflict with the aims of Article VII ofthe Mutual Aid Agreement, disappears. This is good. These devicesare merely possible means for achieving a given end. The right pro-cedure is to await the formulation of plans under Article VII and thedevelopment of the international agricultural policy sketched out atHot Springs, Virginia, and then, if any protection still seems needed,to fulfil the main pledge to agriculture, to adopt such devices as areconsistent with the international plans.(iv) There is no reference to cost.   This omission, taken together with thewording of the second &quot; principle &quot; in paragraph 17, means that weneed not yet abandon hope of agriculture becoming &quot; healthy &quot; in thefull sense of not needing to be subsidised by the consumer or the tax-payer. If the plans for a more active world economy (Article VIIand Hot Springs, Virginia,) come to maturity, this hope, so happy forthe right relations between agriculture and urban industry, may vetbe realised.7. There are, however, certain points in W.P. (43) 422 which need further-elucidation before the policy is finally approved.8. In paragraph 12 it is stated that &quot; discussions with the industry couldbe kept confidential.&quot; This would be most undesirable. If plans are based on abroad policy acceptable to public opinion and we must entertain no other there is no need for secrecy. In confidential discussions it will be pressed upon theGovernment that they can lead nowhere without some commitment and theGovernment may be impelled to accept proposals which it would then feel obligedin honour to defend in Parliament. It is necessary to recognise the very specialresponsibilities of the present Government; grounds for confidence in it are sostrong that it is able to carry measures which an ordinary Government could not.It is therefore its duty to be especially vigilant not to become committed tounpopular measures, which have no relevance to winning the war. Now would itbe to the long-run advantage of agriculture to have Parliament confronted with afait accompli and a measure passed which public opinion subsequently felt to havebeen an unwarranted concession to a sectional interest. If the discussions areopen, public opinion will have the opportunity to declare itself and the Govern-ment will have due warning and guidance.9. At several points there is reference to &quot; the industry.&quot; What is &quot; theindustry &quot;? Is there any body which can be confidently held to represent themajority of farmers? In the haste and hurly-burly of war producers may becontent to leave matters to spokesmen, to whom they would by no means be willingto entrust their permanent destiny; moreover, during the war the whole trend hasbeen towards greater profit, while in the reconstruction settlement there canhardly fail to be thorns as well as roses. Even if there were a body which couldbe properly regarded as representative of the majority, there are many pointsliable to be raised for discussion (e.g., production quotas) on which it would bequite wrong to impose the ideas of a majority on a minority. It may be necessarythat the Government should impose a settlement agreed to by a majority upon awhole industry in cases where there is a prior national interest that some settle-merit should be enforced, e.g., minimum wages or working conditions. But themere fact that the majority wish a certain arrangement is not a sufficient reasonfor imposing this on the others. Consequently the discussions should not beregarded as a means of striking a bargain between the public and the farmers, butrather as an occasion for ventilating provisional conclusions of the Governmentand the views of some representative farmers, it being always understood that theviews of other farmers would also be taken into consideration before any commit-ment was made.   This is a further reason for having the discussions public.
10. Then there is the question of &quot; control,&quot; Control may be welcomed as acompromise between nationalisation and private enterprise; but it is also possibleto get the worst of both worlds. Some degree of State control may well prove to beessential at a great many points in our reconstruction plans; we should thereforebe on our guard against multiplying controls beyond necessity; there is no doubtthat the public is already becoming restive. In the case of agriculture, farmersshould be reassured by a strict definition of the proper limits of control. They willcertainly be glad to forgo additional subventions in exchange for greater freedomof action.11.. Control may be approved in two cases : (i) A farmer should be prevented from neglecting his land to the detrimentof his neighbours, e.g., by allowing weeds or neglecting drainage,(ii) Within the limits of validity of the argument of paragraph 42 ofW..P. (43) 103 that legislation has rendered landlords powerless toprevent deterioration of their land, State control may be called uponto secure that capital is kept intact. It must be remembered, however,that it is not necessarily economic or desirable to keep all land at agiven level of productivity, lest we may be brought back to the doctrineof the maintenance of soil fertility by a side-wind.12. W.P. (43) 422, however, hints a wider and more dubious scheme forState control. Control is to &quot; ensure efficiency &quot; (paragraph 18, 3rd&quot; principle &quot;). This opens the door to unlimited interference. And is it reallysound so to divide responsibility? If the farmer has to follow instructionsagainst his better judgment, he will have an equitable claim for unlimitedassistance if things go wrong. But, then, would it not be better to give up allpretence of a profit economy and pay farmers a salary, which would amount tonationalisation of farming? If the obedient farmer is to be carried safely throughall adversity, the public will hardly allow him to reap the profits when tradeis good.13. This argument is reinforced when wre consider the human element.Agriculture is an industry in which individuals are particularly prone to proceedabout their business in their own peculiar way; they may break all the ruleswhich would be laid down by a local committee, or even by the Ministry, and yetbe efficient. If agriculture is to retain good elements in our population, it musthave counter-attractions compared with urban pursuits. One great attraction isthat a man in a fairly small way can be independent and does not have to submithis decisions to a superior. This will be lost if the Ministry has a roving commis-sion to supervise efficiency.14. It is not established that British agriculture has been abnormallyinefficient, having regard to the difficult conditions in the last two decades. Allthe same, we must seek earnestly for improvement, and the right method isindicated in W.P. (43) 422, paragraph 17, 4th &quot; principle.&quot; The State should,direct its attention to reorganising and improving educational and advisoryservices. Farmers should not be handicapped by lack of information about thelatest technical advances. The reference to &quot;promoting efficiency&quot; by thesemeans is sound. But the reference to public control to &quot; ensure efficiency&quot; isunwise and opens dangerous possibilities.15. Is there also a hint that control may be contemplated to enforce certainsystems of husbandry (paragraphs 2 (a) and 5) ? W.P. (43) 103 containedinteresting information about the value of ley farming. But it must beemphasised that this method must be allowed to justify itself by results and shouldnot be enforced by &quot;control &quot; or subsidised at the public expense. If it is reallymore fruitful, it will win its own way, though, of course, every effort should bemade to diffuse information about it in accordance with paragraph 14 above.16. In W.P. (43) 103 the principal emphasis was laid on an increase offodder crops (paragraph 16) and it is possible paragraphs 2 (a) and 5 of thepresent paper should be read in the light of that. Questions of defence areinvolved and the national importance of this point justifies dwelling on it.17. It is commonly agreed that a large merchant fleet is one of our strategicbulwarks. By itself this propositon is a rather vague platitude which does notthrow much light. Experience of two wars enables us to specify with precisionhow a large merchant navy is of assistance.   What is essential is a reserve of[26247] b 2
shipping. Assuming that the nation cannot dispense with certain imports andno plan can save us from that-more shipping is needed in war time to importa given quantity of essential goods, owing to convoy delays, the closing of certaintrade routes, &amp;c., and the Services require a certain amount of merchant shippingfor their own purposes. To maintain a reserve in peace time it is important tohave a certain volume of bulky imports that can be dispensed with in war time.In the present war the two main items in this category, by comparison with whichthe rest were trivial, were animal feeding-stuffs and timber. From this serviceit was possible to release some 15 million tons of annual importing capacity, ofwhich animal feeding-stuffs accounted for nearly half This corresponds roughlyto the amount of carrying capacity that we were able to build, with all our efforts,in the first three years of war. Without this release of shipping from unessentialtrade it is difficult to see how we could have survived the years 1940-42. Anincrease of fodder crops would thus reduce the kind of peace-time trade that isof the greatest use in war time precisely because it can then be dispensed with. Itwould be unrealistic to claim that instead we could keep a vast mass of unusedshipping in reserve in dry dock. And even if we did, where would be the trainedcrews to man them? Foreign trade is useful because it keeps not only ships butalso men in active service in peace time. In order not to weaken our defences,our increased agricultural production should consist either of produce whichwe could not dispense with in war time or of produce which we shouldnot import in any case. The former idea cannot be carried far in thecase of wheat owing to the unsuitability of our soil, but it is favourable to anincrease of livestock; the latter chimes in with the proposal for encouraging theproduction of milk and fresh vegetables. To take a slightly different point,a country which has to be careful in her foreign purchases owing to her balanceof trade position and is yet anxious to keep a big merchant fleet afloat, shouldclearly favour imports which have large bulk in relation to their value. Animalfeeding-stuff is the pre-eminent instance of such an import.18. Finally, the reference to &quot; guaranteed markets and prices.&quot; if takenliterally, would contemplate a Utopian state of farming raised to an exalted andunmatched condition of privilege. Xo such condition has ever been enjoyed byan industry or ever could be enjoyed by more than one or two industries selectedfor exceptional favours. Some clarification is needed here. A few points areput forward for consideration : (i) Farmers have undoubtedly had a just grievance recently in the abnormallylarge oscillation of farm prices. This may be because manufacturingindustries have been better able to meet large reductions in demandby corresponding reductions in output. Ffere our hopes should bebuilt on an international solution. Great Britain is at present puttingforward a (buffer stock) scheme for reducing the oscillation of worldfarm prices to reasonable amplitude. If this scheme does not findfavour, it is almost certain that other international schemes forreducing oscillations will come into being. These, since they will&apos; probably involve more restriction and higher prices for our imports,will not be so favourable to Great Britain, but they will not be lessfavourable to her farmers. Should, however, all international plansbreak down, there would be a strong case for a purely national schemefor reducing price oscillations. e.g., by subsidies in low-price yearsbalanced by taxes in high-price years. This plan would not be a suit-able subject for discussions at present, since it presupposes a defeatisthypothesis.(ii) Apart from oscillations, the general average level of world farm pricesmay prove to be too low to prevent the British countryside frombecoming a &quot;depressed area.&quot; To honour our general undertakingto agriculture, it would then be necessary to give assistance in a wayconsonant with agreements reached under Article VII. As, however,we do not yet know if prices will in fact be so low. and we do not knowwhat the agreements under Article VII will be, it would be prematureto discuss with faianers the precise methods of assistance that would beappropriate in conditions not yet foreseeable.(iii) It is not quite clear what the words &quot; and markets &quot; contribute to themeaning of the expression &quot;guaranteed prices and markets.&quot;Guaranteed prices would seem to give all that a producer of. primaryproducts could desire. But possibly what is intended is that guaran-teed prices should only be guaranteed for a limited and specified
quantity of produce, and that existing farmers should be restricted inthe amount they may produce, and persons not already on a register berestricted from entering into competition. Any such restrictionwould be so discordant with our real and declared intention to promotean &quot; expansionist &quot; economy, that it must surely be excluded from theprojected discussions.19. It seems to follow that there is not material for immediate discussionin the second &quot;principle&quot; of paragraph 17, that the discussions should beconfined to the first, third, fourth and fifth &quot; principles&quot; and the words &quot; toensure efficiency&quot; in the third &quot;principle&quot; should be restricted to the sensedefined in paragraph 11 (i) and (ii) above and not extended to cover mattersreferred to in paragraphs 12-15.(Initialled) A.
