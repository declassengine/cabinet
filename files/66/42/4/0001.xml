It isprobable that when final figures become available the increases for Admiraltyand M.A.P. and the reduction for Ministry of Supply up to the 31st August willbe greater than those given in the Table.The special measures authorised by the War Cabinet for expanding thelabour force working for the Ministry of Aircraft Production could not be madeeffective in the early part of August, and expansion of the munitions labourforce during that month was hindered to some extent by holidays. In spite ofthis the appropriate share of the approved increase on M.A.P. work wassubstantially achieved.5. August. The intakes for August and the balances outstanding at the1st September were as follows : 
In the five months the 1st April to the 31st August taken as a whole the netdecrease on Ministry of Supply work (66,000) was equal to the net increase onAdmiralty and M.A.P. work, but in August it was less than that increase.During the whole period only a part of the net increase on Admiralty and M.A.P.work was the result of the direct transference of labour from Ministry of Supplywork. A reduction in the numbers employed on Ministry of Supply workinvolves a loss of man-power for munitions production. A proportion of thosereleased are immobile or would be leaving industry in any case, and cannot betransferred to work on the expanding programmes. Moreover, only a part ofthe Ministry of Supply reduction is the result of cuts in areas where labour isrequired for work on the other programmes. These facts have an importantbearing on the steps that must be taken to achieve the remainder of the allocationsfor the Admiralty and M.A.P. up to the end of the year.Other Essential Industries and Services.8. The net increase approved by the War Cabinet for this group for theperiod the 1st April to the 31st December, 1943, was 70,000. The Lord Presidentof the Council was authorised to distribute this total among the variousindustries and services included within the group. For most of these, statisticsof the numbers employed are not available for a date later than the 1st July. Thefollowing Table shows the net increases allocated, the net increase achieved upto the latest date for which figures are available, and the balances outstandingat that date :  Industry or Service.

On the otherhand, the industrial staff of the War Office and Ministry of Supply have declined.Civil Defence.9. The War Cabinet directed that the numbers of full-time workers inCivil Defence (including Police and National Fire Service) should be reduced bya further 15,000 before the end of 1943, in addition to the reduction of 75,000from the 30th June, 1942, previously approved. This gives a total reduction of90,000 to be effected between the 30th June, 1942, and the 31st December, 1943.Up to the 31st July, 1943, the numbers had been reduced bv 64,700, leaving abalance of 25,300.E.
