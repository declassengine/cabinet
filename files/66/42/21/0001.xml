this document is the property of his britannic majesty^ governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, October, 1943SECRET--&apos; Copy No.   3 3W.P. (43) 4712ist October, 1943.WAR CABINETCONDITIONS OF BRITISH PRISONERS OF WAR IN SIAMMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI. Accumulating information of a confidential nature as to the conditions of Britishand Allied prisoners of war in Siam reveals a situation so. serious that I think the WarCabinet should be in possession of the facts.2. We know from military sources that prisoners and natives are being used tomake a new railway between Barnpong in Southern Siam and Thambyuzayat whichis some 35 miles South of Moulmein in Burma. This railway is being driven througha jungle area whose climate would be extremely trying for Europeans in any circum-stances. The country is virtually uninhabited so that there are no local resources whichcould provide medical or other material relief.3. Monsieur Siegenthaler, the Swiss Consul at Bangkok, who is not allowed by theJapanese authorities to make any enquiries about the treatment of the prisoners of war,nas recently sent confidentially the following reports in respect of their conditions, hisinformation being derived partly from personal contacts and partly from a letter ofappeal written by prisoners at one of the camp hospitals:  &quot; 40-60,000 British and Dutch prisoners working long hours under most arduousconditions in the jungle have no housing, sanitary installations or other necessities.The majority have no shirts. Some have no shoes or hats and a small number haveno trousers.   Up to the present the Japanese have not bothered to supply these needs.The number of men unfit to work assembled in three principal camp hospitals isestimated at 10,000. Their treatment is rendered extremely difficult owing to the lackof medical supplies and medical installations.Principal illnesses; dysentery, beri-beri, malaria, black water fever, diphtheria,cholera, typhoid, skin diseases, anaemia.Three-quarters of the men are suffering from malaria. The Japanese are againsupplying quinine after a complete lack for a certain time.The number of deaths is estimated at 3,000 or 4,000 and the percentage is stillincreasing.&quot;(Note. The figure of 3,000 was contained in a document of appeal from theprisoners of war from one hospital as being accurate to their own knowledge. A sub-sequent telegram gives the figure as &quot; more than 5,000 and according to certain rumoursas high as 12,000 &quot;.   Less than 100 have been officially reported to us by the Japanese.)&quot; Rations based on Japanese requirements are totally insufficient for Europeansliving in a tropical climate.   Diet principally consists of polished rice and salted fish;meat, eggs and vegetables are lacking.Officers have been forced to work., Fresh measures have recently been taken to accelerate the construction of therailway and prisoners are constantly at work.&quot;4. The following action has been taken:  (a) A protest to the Ja panese Government made last July drew an uncompromisingand cynical reply.(b) A further protest was made in August and was communicated at Tokyo whileM. Pilet Golaz, the Swiss Foreign Minister, also took the matter up personallywith the Japanese Minister at Berne.   Copy of the telegram is annexed.** Annexure : Telegram No. 320S, dated 24th August, from the Foreign Office to Berne.
(c) An appeal has also been made to the Vatican.(d) A broadcast in Japanese repeated over a period of lour days has been madeto Japan describing the appalling conditions and the Japanese Governmentstreatment of the protests made to them. This broadcast took the form of astatement issued with the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Governments and wasdesigned to ensure that the whole position was brought to the knowledgeof the highest authorities in Japan.Every possible means of bringing material relief both by local expenditure andthe despatch of supplies by exchange ships is being used, but all this merely scratches thesurface.5. Two factors seem to require special consideration:  As the notifications of deaths increase they may rouse the public to a realizationof what is happening.The information transmitted by Monsieur Siegenthaler is obtained without Japaneseknowledge and His Majesty&apos;s Governments are pledged to the Swiss Government totreat it as confidential. In any case action which reveals to the Japanese the sourceof our information would no doubt result in their stopping further reports by MonsieurSiegenthaler.6. I think that the public must be told the facts,and I am consulting with the ForeignSecretary as to how this should be done without endangering the various interestsinvolved.The situation is one of considerable complexity involving the interests of the prisonersof war themselves; those of the United States, the Netherlands, the Dominions andIndia; the position of Monsieur Siegenthaler and of the Swiss Government.P. J. G.The War Office,21st October, 1943.COPY(CYPHER). DEPARTMENTAL No. 2.From Foreign Office Lo BerneNo. 3208.24th August, 1943. D. 11.40 pun. 24/.//. August, 1943.IMPORTANT.Your telegrams Nos. 3796 and 3888 (of August 7th and 16th respectively: conditionsin Prisoners of War Camps in Siam).This information, following upon the cynical reply in your telegram No. 3749(of August 5th) to representations asked for in my telegram No. 2400 (of June 23rd),makes it necessary for us to ask you to discuss the next step personally with M. PiletGolaz. While we have in mind the necessity of not endangering M. Siegenthalebsposition the fact that between 3,000 and 4,000 of these prisoners have already diedcannot be passed over, and you should express to the Swiss Minister our grave concernabout the situation.2. We suggest that M. Gorge should be fully informed of Siegenthaler&apos;s reports overthe last six months so that he may know how serious it is; and that he be asked toaddress a communication to the Japanese Government on the following lines:  Begins. His Majesty&apos;s Governments are unable to accept the Japanese Govern-ment&apos;s reply (see your telegram No. 3749) to the protest lodged by the Swiss Ministeron July 5th of this year. This communication is content to ignore the informationcommunicated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, which has been confirmed since itsdespatch by further circumstantial reports. It is now clear to His Majestys Govcrn-ments that the conditions under which prisoners of war are kept by the Japanese forcesin Siam are appalling in the fullest sense of the word and His Majesty&apos;s Governments areforced to the conclusion that the continued refusal of the Japanese Government to accordthe customary facilities to the Protecting Power to inspect these camps and to speakto the prisoners themselves, is due to their consciousness that such an inspection wouldinevitably show, not only that the Japanese Government are failing to honour theirown undertaking to apply the terms of the Prisoners of War Convention to prisonerswho fall into their hands, but that their authorities in Siam have shown completedisregard for the most elementary humanitarian principles accepted and applied byall other belligerent powers.
...(b43/1s1)   100   10/43   w.o.p.   15411His Majesty&apos;s Governments must in these circumstances again protest against theinhuman treatment meted out to the prisoners of war held by the Japanese authoritiesin Siam; and they request that the Swiss Consul be allowed to exercise his properfunctions as the representative of the Protecting Power, and to provide an independentreport on the conditions in all camps, and of all prisoners in Japanese hands in Siam;and that the Japanese Government take immediate steps to ensure that full nominallists of all prisoners of war sent to Siam and of those who have died in captivity thereshould be communicated forthwith through the customary channels.3. You should tell M. Pilet Golaz that I shall be very grateful if, in view of theobvious gravity of the situation of our captives in Siam, he feels able to tell the JapaneseMinister in Berne of the distress with which he has seen our reports and protests andto ask the Minister to represent to his Government the desirability of conforming tothe practice of civilized nations and, by notifying names and permitting visits, offollowing the procedures laid down by the Geneva Convention and the general customsand usages of war. M. Pilet Golaz would be able to point out that in no single caseare Japanese prisoners or internees in British hands deprived of the services of therepresentatives of their Protecting Power.4. Other possible action, including suggestion in last paragraph of your telegramNo. 3888, is being investigated and I shall be communicating further with you in thenext few days.   Meanwhile, above action should be taken as a matter of urgency.
