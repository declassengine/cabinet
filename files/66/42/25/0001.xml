(43) 475.25th October, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON TELE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SECOND SOVIETPROTOCOL, WITH COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE SECONDAND THIRD PROTOCOLS.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a report on the fulfilment ofthe Second Soviet Protocol (1st July, 1942, to 30th June, 1943), together withcomparisons between the Second and Third Protocols.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W 1 (Intld.) O. L.25th October, 1943.Report on the Implementation of the Second Soviet Protocol, withComparisons between the Second and Third Protocols.THE Second Soviet Protocol, which was signed on the 6th October, 1942,provided for the transmission of supplies over the period the 1st July, 1942, tothe 30th June, 1943.2. Under the Second Protocol the United Kingdom and United StatesGovernments undertook to make available about 4,400,000 short tons of supplies,about 3.300,000 being for despatch to North Russian ports and 1,100,000 toPersian Gulf ports. This total was chosen as the maximum which could beshipped, the limiting factors being :  )(a) Inland transportation from Persian Gulf ports.(b) The provision of escorts for the Northern Route.(c) Possible shortage of shipping.3. Schedules of stores were given to the Soviet Government, from whichto choose the 4,400.000 tons mentioned. The stores in these schedules amountedto about 8.000,000 short tons.4. No mention was made at that time of the Pacific route (by which storesare carried in Soviet ships to Siberian ports), mainly because too little was knownof its capacity.5. The whole commitment was qualified by a proviso that it was subjectto variations to meet unforeseen developments in the progress of the war, thoughit was added that every effort w?ould be made to deliver the quantities of supplieswhich the Russians chose.6. Against this programme of 4,400,000 short tons, 2,972,000 short tonswere shipped (307,100 tons from the United Kingdom and Empire and2,664,900 tons from North America).  This was carried out as follows : Note by the Chairman.Section A.- General.Short tons.Northern RoutePersian Gulf Route...Pacific RouteOverland from India344,2001,068,6001,517,00042,200[26231]
The achievement therefore fell short of the plan by 34 per cent., mainly as a resultof the closing of the Northern Route. In March 1943 the Prime Minister toldPremier Stalin that the naval forces which the Germans had concentrated inNorthern Norway prevented us from continuing convoys. This made it impossibleto deliver our supplies in full, although our commitment to make them availablewas carried out. in the sense that at no time was there any lack of cargo of thehighest priority ready for shipment.Comparison with the Third Protocol.7. The chief ways in which the Third Protocol differs from the Second areas follows :  (a) The Canadian Government becomes an independent signatory (as aresult of the passing of the Canadian Mutual Aid Act).(b) Instead of a combined target figure of 4.400.000 short tons, the ThirdProtocol provides for 5.100,000 short tons to be made available fromthe United States and Canada, and a list of sup plies, not expressedin tonnage but probably amounting to 400-500.000 short tons, fromthe United Kingdom.(c) Provision is made for over half of the supplies from North America to becarried by the Pacific Route.(d) The quantity of military stores in the United Kingdom schedule is muchreduced, but a large commitment is introduced for industrial equip-ment, which had previously been dealt with only as supplies additionalto the Protocol.Section B. Shipping and Routes.8. The United Kingdom and the United States undertook, under the SecondProtocol, to supply, within the limits imposed by the provision of escorts, inlandclearance from Persian ports and the availability of shipping, the shipping-necessary to lift that part of the 4,400,000 short tons for which Soviet shipscould not be made &quot;available. In practice, availability of shipping did not provea limiting factor, and shipping was always made available up to the capacity ofthe routes.(a) The Northern Route.9. Pive convoys, carrying 344,193 short tons, were sent, the last being inFebruary. Each had to battle its way through; British and United States losseswere :/ (a) By enemy action 2 destroyers, 2 minesweepers and an auxiliary.9 merchant ships, carrying 61,013 short tons of cargo.3 merchant ships on the homeward voyage.(b) By marine risks 2 merchant ships, carrying 11,947 short tons of cargo.(b) The Persian Route.(i) The main route from the Persian Gulf. The highest monthly total ofstores carried across Persia from the Persian Gulf during the First Protocolperiod was about 30,000 long tons (33,600 short tons). In the Second Protocolperiod this was steadily increased, until in June 1943 138.000 long tons (154,160short tons) were sent. This result was only gained by great efforts by the UnitedStates Persian Gulf Service Corps and the Persia and Iraq Command, thoughit falls far short of the 240 000 long tons a month the Prime Minister told PremierStalin in March 1943 we hoped to reach in August (when the actual figure wasunder 200,000 long tons). At all events, the route carried 92 per cent, of thetotal fixed for it at the beginning of the Second Protocol period. Losses were5 United States merchant ships carrying 37,444 short tons.(ii) The Zahidan-Meshed Route. There is also an overland route from Indiavia Zahidan and Meshed, operated by the United Kingdom Commercial Corpora-tion. During the whole Second Protocol period a total of 38,500 long tons weresent this way.
(c) The Pacific Route.This route is operated by ships flying the Soviet flag, 64 of them, totalling613,000 tons dead weight, having been transferred from the United StatesRegistry during the Second Protocol period. The route has always been looked onas uncertain, because the Japanese might interfere with it, but so far they havedone no more than occasionally intercepting vessels and later releasing them. Atleast one such ship carried obviously military cargo.By the end of the Second Protocol period, over 40 ships a month were workingon this route. The limits on it are : (a) port and clearance capacity in Siberia;(b) the unwillingness of the American authorities to tie up more shipping thanthey can help for so long a voyage (3 months turn-round).(d) Air Routes.202 American aircraft were delivered via Alaska by air during the SecondProtocol period, and 376 Hurricanes were sent to Gibraltar or the Middle Eastby sea to be flown on to U.S.S.R. Small quantities of urgent medical and othersupplies were also flown to C.S.S.R., in civil aircraft.Comparison with Third Protocol.10. The table below shows the differences in the aims expressed in the Secondand Third Protocols : .

Kingdom undertakes tomake available the shipping needed, with any Soviet ships available, to shipsupplies from the United Kingdom. The LTnited States undertakes to provideshipping for the whole of the 2.400,000 tons to be shipped eastwards fromNorth America, and to transfer to the Soviet flag enough tonnage to lift, withthe Soviet tonnage at present employed, the 2,700.000 tons to go by the Pacific.&apos;   i \&apos;   ]Section C.

As a result of production and other difficulties, it is doubtful whetherthe full commitment of tanks could have been supplied. But even so, more tankswere always available in the United Kingdom than could be shipped.13. Aircraft could have been made available up to the full amount had therebeen shipping space for them. After the closing of the Northern route, flightdelivery was organised from the United States via Alaska and Siberia, andshipments were made from the United Kingdom to Gibraltar or the Middle Eastfor flight delivery on to U.S.S.R.   (See paragraph 9 (f/).)14.   Naval supplies were made available in full, and in some cases added to.15. During the Second Protocol period there were also sent many militaryitems which were not listed in the Protocol.   They are dealt with in Section E.Comparison with the Third Protocol.16. Lmder the Third Protocol we offer the same total of aircraft as under theSecond, but we have been unable to offer the-types asked for by the Russians, andthe aircraft we are supplying are relatively less up-to-date than those sent underthe Second. The Russians requested 3,000 tanks under the Third Protocol andasked that all these should be Valentines. We are only able to supply 1,000Valentines, which we regard as an obsolescent type and the production of whichis scheduled to cease early in 1944. The Russians having refused all the otherBritish types we offered, the outstanding balance of 2,000 has been transferredto the United States Schedule at the wishes of the American authorities and willbe satisfied by a supply of Shermans.The minor military items of the Second Protocol (anti-tank guns, anti-tankrifles, &amp;c.) are not included in the Third Protocol because the Russians do notwant them.

Backlog of 26,384tons, due to Russian snip-ping difficulties as for lead,cancelled as superseded byThird Protocol offer.Backlog of 214 tons is beingsupplied in full.
18. The only Protocol commitment on which a deficit accumulated becauseof supply difficulties was silver steel, the outstanding balance of which is beingmade good.   Other deficits are due to :  (a) Insufficient shipping priority being accorded by the Russians, as in thecase of ferro-alloys. &apos; ,i(b) Lack of Soviet tonnage to lift, as for lead and wool.(c) Cessation of northern convoys in the case of tin.(rf) Transport   difficulties   on   the   overland   route   from   India   (jute),&apos;accentuated by the use of this route for supplies of tea for U.S.S.R.(see paragraph 20 below).Comparison with the Third Protocol.19. Supply of five of the items included in tire United Kingdom SecondProtocol commitment is being discontinued under the Third Protocol, namely,.Aluminium, Ferro-chrome, Ferro-silicon and Nickel (ail to be supplied in futurefrom Canada) and Silver Steel. There are four new items on the Third Protocolschedule, namely, Cresol, Cobalt, High Speed Steel and Sisal. Where materialssupplied under the Second Protocol are also supplied under the Third, thequantities are not in every case the same.(2) Food.20. The United Kingdom commitment in the Second Protocol was forsupplies which would go &apos;&apos; in broken stowage in ships carrying tanks and air-craft.&quot; The following are some of the main items supplied and shipped fromthe United Kingdom and Empire sources : Cocoa beans ...       ... 4,004 tons (from United Kingdom).Palm Oil      ...... 2,821 tons (from West Africa).Pimento Pepper      ... 500 tons (from Jamaica),Black Pepper          ... 450 tons (from India).Tea    ...      ...      ... 7,589 tons (from India and Ceylon).15.364 tons.Of these only cocoa beans were carried as &quot; broken stowage &quot; ; the others shouldtherefore strictly be regarded as non-Protocol supplies.(3) Medical Supplies.21. No commitment was entered into as part of the Second Protocol, buttwo lists of requirements were submitted during the period under review,Sir Arthur Parsons&apos;s List (in March 1942), and the Supplementary List (inDecember 1942). These Lists included drugs, instruments, hospital tents andequipment, and the cost of the items supplied against them amounted toapproximately  766,000. Apart from those items on which we could make nooffer of supply at all (i.e., where there was no manufacturing capacity in thiscountry), it is estimated that the Russian requirements were 80 per cent,fulfilled.(4) Machine Tools.22. Machine tools were regarded as a Protocol commitment but wereexcluded from the Second Protocol Schedule because they ran from January toDecember 1943 instead of from July 1942 to June 1943. &apos; Total commitments ofmachine tools scheduled for delivery between the 1st July, 1942, and the30th June, 1943, were 3,027, of which 1,551, to a total value of about  1 -1 million-were completed during the period.(5) Extra-Protocol Supplies.23. The medical supplies and machine tools referred to above are. strictlyspeaking, extra-Protocol supplies, but, having been asked for in consolidatedLists, have been dealt with on much the same footing as supplies made under theProtocol.   Civil extra-Protocol supplies generally are described in Section F.
152areComparison with the Third Protocol.24. Under the Third Protocol, medical supplies and machine toolsincluded as Protocol items, together with a list of industrial plant of similarcharacter to items previously ordered individually. Foodstuffs will be supplied,;as in the Second Protocol, as far as broken stowage is available.Section ^-Treatment of Unshipped Balances of United Kingdom Commitments.25. Unshipped balances outstanding (i.e., not shipped or booked forshipment on a named vessel before the 1st July, 1943) at the end of the Secondprotocol period, arc treated in two different ways. Balances of items whichare being repeated m the Third Protocol are cancelled, as they are supersededby the new offers; provision for this cancellation is madexin the Third ProtocolItems which are not being repeated are dealt with on their merits. Aircraft hasbeen treated as a special case and the backlog is being made &quot;ood26.Outstanding balances which are being cancelled are as follows :  Quantity Third ProtocolOutstanding.

Stqjplies additional to the Protocol Commitment.28. Besides the supplies promised under the Second Protocol, the Russiansasked us from time to time for a great variety of military and civil stores, whichwe have offered as far as our resources have allowed.29. These demands, being received continuously, are not related toparticular Protocol periods, but when an order is accepted the Russians aregiven an estimate of the day by which manufacture will be completed.(1) Military Items.30. The following table shows the principal military extra-Protocol itemsmade available and shipped from the 1st July, 1942, to the 30th June, 1943 :-Aircraft (i) Albemarles(ii) Spitfires V.B.(iii) Hurricane II.D(iv) Hampdcns...Lorries 3-ton30-cwt.......Shipped.141506025520382Remarks.Offer was for 200.
