(43) 485.29th October, 1943.WAR CABINET.DRAFT STATEMENT ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ONLAND UTILISATION IN RURAL AREAS.THE Committee on Land Utilisation in Rural Areas, of which Lord JusticeScott was Chairman, was appointed by the Minister of Works and Buildings, inconsultation with the Minister of Agriculture, in October 1941, with the followingterms of reference :  &quot;To consider the conditions which should govern building and otherconstructional development in country areas consistently with the main-tenance of agriculture, and in particular the factors affecting the location ofindustry, having regard to economic operation, part-time and seasonalemployment, the well-being of rural communities and the preservation ofrural amenities.&quot;These terms of reference were for England and Wales only and did notinclude Scotland.2. The Report was issued as Command Paper No. 6378 in August 1942.I here was also a Minority Report by one member of the Committee.3. The Report extends over a very wide range of national policy. Thecommittee themselves were only concerned with conditions in rural areas, butmany of the questions on which they submitted recommendations must beconsidered from the wider standpoint of the nation as a whole. While, therefore,it is now possible to indicate Government decisions, or the general trend ofGovernment policy, in regard to many of the recommendations, the action to betaken on others will necessarily depend on the determination of major issues ofnational importance still under examination by the Government Departmentsconcerned.[26310]
4. Many of the 108 recommendations in the Report are not such as torequire legislation. They rather constitute a welcome body of principles for theguidance of those concerned in the preparation of a planning framework and withthe provision of housing and services in rural areas.5. Broadly speaking, the report contemplates a wider interpretation and amore general application of town and country planning than hitherto. Theconstitution of a Central Planning Authority in the form of a Ministry of Townand Country Planning, while not following the precise proposals of theCommittee, has provided central machinery for planning and the recommenda-tions of the Committee as regards planning in country areas have been generallyendorsed in the declarations of policy that have been made on behalf of the newMinistry. The Town and Country Planning (Interim Development) Act of thisSession gives effect to the recommendations for greater powers of central directionand control. Under this Act local planning becomes compulsory over the wholecountry, and action is being taken to encourage co-operation between existingplanning authorities and the participation of county councils in this field. Thesesteps will, incidentally, facilitate the employment of suitably qualified personnel.Ten Regional Planning Officers have been appointed by the Minister of Townand Country Planning, and these officers are in close touch with the local PlanningAuthorities in their respective areas.6. In the field of survey and research as a preparatory step to nationalplanning, the Ministry of Town and Country Planning is engaged on the assemblyof information on all forms of land resources and the conditions affecting theiruse; and this information is being brought together in a co-ordinated series ofplanning maps. The Ministry is carrying out detailed surveys around expandingurban areas in conjunction with the other Ministries concerned. Special attentionis also being directed by the Government to the appropriate uses of land andbuildings that will no longer be needed by the Service Departments after the war.7. Arrangements have been made, and are working smoothly, for closeinter-departmental co-operation in all matters affecting land use. These arrange-ments are to ensure, among other things, as the Committee proposed (a) that full weight is given in future planning to agricultural considera-tions in which connection it may be recalled that the Governmenthave already stated that they &quot;will seek to avoid the diversion ofproductive agricultural land to other purposes if there is unproductiveor less productive land that could reasonably be used for thosepurposes&quot; (Official Report, House of Commons, the 11th February,1942, Col. 1533); and(b) that the essential interdependence of the future pattern of road and railcommunications on the one hand, and of the national and localproblems of town and country planning on the other, is kept in mind.8. The Committee recommend that Statutory Undertakers should be subjectto planning control. Development carried out by these undertakers under generalstatutory powers is already subject to planning control, but in the applicationof this control regard has to be paid to the fact that in the exercise of theirpowers Statutory Undertakers are often under obligations prescribed by Act ofParliament which may make it difficult in practice to impose on them restrictionsthat might otherwise be desirable on planning grounds. Provisions regardingdevelopment carried out by Statutory Undertakers under Special Acts &quot;will beincluded in a General Interim Development Order which will shortly be madeunder the Planning Acts. As regards future Bills, the Minister of Town andCountry Planning will make reports to the Committees of both Houses on theplanning aspects of such Private Bills.9. Within the general operation of planning machinery the Committee referto four main aspects of Government policy as affecting the countryside. Emphasisis laid first on the successful cultivation of the soil as the foundation of all ruraleconomy. The maintenance of a healthy and well-balanced agriculture and thepursuit of a vigorous forestry policy are already accepted elements in theGovernments post-war policy.10. Secondly, the Committee submit a series of recommendations regardingthe location and conduct of industry other than agriculture in rural areas.
Several of these are in accordance with current planning practice, but the Govern-ment recognise that further reinforcement is necessary. Other recommendationsrelate to the rural aspect of the larger national issues raised by the recommenda-tions of the Royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population,and the Expert Committee on Compensation and Betterment, and must beconsidered in the light of future decisions on those Reports. The widerecommendations of the Report as to extractive industries cover a variety ofminerals, distinguishing certain major groups. As these minerals form the rawmaterial for important industries, it is essential, as the Report says, that fullconsideration be given in each case to the economic issues involved. Attentionis being concentrated for the present on the relatively shallow surface workingscovering a wide extent of ground, such as open-cast coal, ironstone and gravel,which give rise to the most serious problems. Open-cast coal is being workedalmost entirely under Government control, and in most cases excavation isimmediately followed by restoration. Informed conclusions as to the best methodsof planning control for other surface minerals can only be reached as the resultof detailed investigations of a highly technical nature, such as have already beeninstituted for ironstone and gravel by the Ministry of Town and Country Planningin conjunction with the other Departments concerned.11. Thirdly, the Committee submit a series of recommendations designedto promote the general wrell-being of rural communities. The Government acceptthe broad object of these recommendations. Many of them have been, or arebeing, taken into consideration in the preparation of post-war plans for housing,education, &amp;c. Other recommendations, such as the supply of electricity through-out the country at town prices, the extension of gas supply to rural areas and thegeneral reorganisation of water supply, raise issues of great importance andcomplexity involving much wider considerations than those before the Committee.Each of these questions must be decided on a careful balance of nationaladvantage, and the Departments concerned are proceeding with their examination.12. The twin objects of the fourth group of recommendations of theCommittee, viz., those relating to the preservation of rural amenities and theprovision of improved access to the countryside, are accepted by the Govern-ment: the various detailed proposals are under close review by the severalDepartments concerned with a view to appropriate action. Surveys are beingmade of areas suitable for national parks, nature reserves and recreationalpurposes, and a detailed coastal survey is being prepared as a basis for improvedmeasures of access and control. There can be no doubt that the post-war periodwill see a greatly increased demand for holiday facilities, especially in thecountry; and the means of providing such facilities, including, in suitableplaces, the provision of holiday camps, are being worked out by the Depart-ments concerned. In general, the Government accept the view that the naturalbeauty of our countryside is a matter of national importance and, as such, mustbe of direct concern to national planning.Additional Paragraphs in regard to Scotland.13 The Committee dealt only with conditions in England and Wales, butin February 1943 the Secretary of State for Scotland appointed a committeeunder the Chairmanship of Lord Normand, Lord President of the Court olSession, to consider the English Committee&apos;s recommendations so far as they wereapplicable to Scots conditions. Lord Normand&apos;s Committee reported that theScottish problems were being dealt with by the Committees set up by the Secretaryof State in consultation with his Council of Ex-Secretaries of State and by theScottish Departments in consultation with.-the Ministries concerned and theappropriate Scottish organisations.14. The Committees set up by the Secretary of State cover many subjectsof vital importance to the Scottish countryside such as housing, education, hydro-electric development, hill sheep, land settlement, design of farm buildings and theherring industry. The Scottish Council on industry is also concerning itself withthe establishment and maintenance of rural industries, including enquiry intosuch matters as the wool industry, the white fish industry and canning. TheCommittee on Hydro- Electric Development has already reported and some of theother Committees should be in a position to report at an early date. The Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland) Act passed this year is the first fruit of thework of those Committees.
15. The Secretary of State exercises in Scotland functions parallel to thoseof the Minister of Town and Country Planning in England and Wales and themachinery of planning is similar in both countries.16. The Scottish Town and Country Planning (Interim Development) Billwhich is at present before Parliament is the counterpart of the English Act whichhas recently been passed.17. The Secretary of State, as the Minister responsible in Scotland notonly for town and country planning but also for agriculture, education, housingand public health, is in a specially favourable position to secure the effectiveco-ordination of matters of policy on the main questions affecting land utilisa-tion in rural areas in Scotland./
