(43) 477.-loth October, 1943.WAR CABINET.RECIPROCAL AID TO UNITED STATES.4 nMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. In W.P. (43) 331 my predecessor indicated the issues and proposed apolicy which was approved by the Cabinet (W.M. (43) 106th Conclusions). Thispolicy included the early publication of a White Paper putting Lend-Lease andReciprocal Aid in the wider perspective of the pooling of resources anddescribing the range and estimated value of the Reciprocal Aid we were givingnot only to the United States but to Russia, and other Allies. The White Paperwas drafted in the closest association with the representatives of the Lend-Lease Administration in London and was acceptable to their Department, whointended to use it in a propaganda effort by the Administration on the linesof paragraph 1 of W.P. (43) 331.The presentation of the Paper was to have been accompanied by a state-ment in Parliament that we were going to give raw materials from the UnitedKingdom and the Colonies and Southern Rhodesia as Reciprocal Aid. We hadkept the Dominions fully informed of our policy and had assumed that the StateDepartment would approach them.A Note explaining our policy had been presented by our iVmbassador toMr. Hull, but a few hours before the White Paper was to be in the Vote OfficeMr. Morgenthau intervened and sent a personal request to Sir Kingsley Woodthat publication of the White Paper should be postponed. His reasons havenever become fully known: apparently our figures did not add up to enough.Moreover, lie was disappointed because we were not able to announce that rawmaterials from the whole Commonwealth would be given as Reciprocal Aid;this situation was clue to the failure of the State Department to make directapproaches to the Dominions and to India, who all have separate Lend-Leasearrangements with the United States.As it was clear that the Administration would not be whole-heartedly behindthe White Paper, the Paper was postponed. This carried with it postponementof the declaration about raw materials.2. There was no disagreement between us and the Lend-Lease Adminis-tration that a white Paper should be published as soon as convenient, and duringthe last six weeks we have been discussing with them some secondary amendmentsin the Paper and also the detailed arrangements for bringing into effect our giftof raw materials. Discussions have also been proceeding, though rather slowly,about the supersession of agreement of the White Paper which at present placesrestriction on our export trade in the light of Lend-Lease.3. All the arrangements were well on for an early presentation to Parlia-ment of our story when telegram 4756 was received, followed by Rernac 378and 379 attached (see Appendix).4.   I cannot regard the proposals in these telegrams as satisfactory and donot wish to accept this indeterminate position.   We have never told Parliament[26296] - b
or the public here the full range of our Reciprocal Aid. No full statement of ourcase has been made in the United States (nor in this country), and it has hithertoto all intents and purposes gone by default. There is virtually no comprehensionamong Americans of the range of the reciprocal aid we are giving them and ourother Allies. This situation is made worse by the misinformed attacks in theAmerican press on our use of Lend-Lease materials, and by a probability that theSenatorial enquiry will throw a lot of mud at us. It may well be that statementswill be made during that enquiry on which an immediate reply or denial wouldbe necessary. We nave suffered&apos; too much on Lencl-Lease and Reciprocal Aidby having to make incomplete statements. In my opinion we should make acomplete statement.5. I think also that this statement should be made as soon as possible sothat it can, as it were, form part of the evidence in the light of which theSenatorial Committee will report before the bar of American opinion. It seemsto me that Parliament also is entitled to know our full story before the Congres-sional Committee gets busy on us.I can see no advantage in waiting. If we present the White Paper after theconclusion of the enquiry and accompany it with our statement about rawmaterials, either that will be regarded as a sequel to the pressure created bythe enquiry or as an anti-climax. Nor can we expect a more favourable momentin the future. There is evidence that the tide has turned against the five Senatorsand that the three-Power meeting in Moscow has stimulated a real desire to dojustice to America&apos;s Allies. On the other hand, we have been warned thatLend-Lease may become a running sore and the closer the American Electionsthe more use will be made of it.We had to tell the Dominions and the Government of India why we postponedthe announcement two months ago. We have recently approached them againon the subject of the raw materials and told them it was urgent. If after this wehave to say that once more we have postponed the White Paper and the announce-ment at the request of the American Administration, our policy may well seemalmost unintelligible.6. Needless to say I do not wish to provoke an issue. What I fear is thatif the whole position is not denied up now, before it becomes woise, the inevitablestrains at Washington may hinder business between us and the Administration.Paragraph 2 of Remac 378 and Remac 379 illustrate this. These are difficultieswhich ought not to exist and were indeed unexpected. Whether they are real,or are simply a tactical move to play the matter long until the CongressionalEnquiry is out of the way. is uncertain. If they are only tactical, we have noassurance that after the Enquiry they will be resolved to our satisfaction,especially if awkward statements are made about us at the Enquiry. Even if theEnquiry is nominally private there will be leakages, and from what we know ofthe personalities, it will not be impartial.We have many friends in the Administration and I am advised that if wetake up the whole matter now. there would be a good chance of clearing theatmosphere appreciably.I should add that behind this immediate question of reciprocal aid lies theissue of the size of our gold and dollar balances, an issue which is crucial for us.7. On rate materials, in the last week the Administration have approachedthe Dominions and India in the proper way. South Africa and New Zealandhave notified their acceptance and the Government of India, on whom the burdenis heaviest, have told us that they accept in principle, subject to certain conditionswhich I hope can be disposed of before they inform the State Department.Rather unexpectedly Australia has instructed the Australian Minister inWashington to notify the State Department that the Commonwealth Governmentcannot accept. (See telegram in Appendix.) I believe that the AustralianMinister has not yet acted on his instructions and, if my colleagues support thepolicy I propose below, I should hope that we might make further representationsto the Commonwealth Government.8. I understand that the President of the Board of Trade regards it asessential to make some announcement that discussions are proceeding with theUnited States Government for the withdrawal of the Export Trade WhitePaper.   I agree with this view.
9. I ask the Cabinet therefore to agree that as soon as the way can becleared the following action should be taken :- (i) That a telegram should be sent to Washington in reply to 4756 explain-ing our attitude on the lines of the arguments above and making itplain that we cannot assent to presentation of the White Paper to ourParliament being delayed until the Congressional Enquiry iscompleted.(ii) That on the presentation of the White Paper an announcement shouldbe made about raw materials as Reciprocal Aid, and that we shouldarrange that simultaneous publicity is given by all the Dominions andthe Government of India about their decisions, subject, of course, tothe Commonwealth Government accepting a change of policy and toclearing up the points with the Government of India.(iii) That at the same time an announcement should be made by the Presidentof the Board of Trade with regard to the discussions on the ExportWhite Paper.(iv) That the Ministry of Information should handle the release of the WhitePaper with the press, and possibly with the American correspondentsover here.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.25th October. 1943.APPENDIX.1. Telegram 4756 from Washington (Sir R. I. Campbell) (dated the 21st October).Mr. Acheson raised with Sir David Waley, Mr. Magowan and myselfyesterday, at Mr. Stettinius&apos;s request, question of time-table with respect topublication of reciprocal aid White Paper and of joint declaration concerninguse of mutual aid materials. He informed us that Senate had decided on aninvestigation of Lend-Lease and that Mr. Stettinius considered that there wouldbe advantage in getting this investigation behind us before publication ofdocuments now in draft and under discussion between us. Reasons for thisopinion were that, if during investigation new matter on this subject was injectedinto situation, questions might be raised in minds of Senators, confusionengendered, and it might not be possible to deal with investigation in as rapidand clear-cut a fashion as they hoped and intended to be able to do. Intentionwas that Administration would firmly grasp nettle and deal with senatorialCommittee quickly and at a high level, e.g., Stettinius, Marshall and King. Ithought that this would take about two to three weeks. Reason for his raisingmatter at this moment was that he had thought there was some possibility of HisMajesty&apos;s Government desiring to present White Paper to Parliament withinnext few clays.2. We told him that there was no such intention, but that no doubt HisMajesty&apos;s Government would wish to lay paper at first convenient moment aftermutual aid had been settled with United Kingdom, Dominions concerned andIndia.3. Mr. Acheson said that there would be no objection to continuation ofdiscussions between officials about text of documents, so that agreed texts wouldbe ready when time came. I suspect, however, that progress will be pretty slowuntil senatorial investigation is nearing its end.4. In course of discussion I suggested to Acheson that there might bedisadvantage in time-table he suggested because action then taken by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and by two Governments jointly might then appear onlyto be result of senatorial prodding and guilty consciences on our part.Mr. Acheson said that this point had been taken into full consideration, butStettinius had thought that on balance what he now proposed was best. In anycase, there was already on record in congressional record a statement to effectthat discussions were in progress with a view to cost-free delivery of certain rawmaterials as reciprocal aid (by the United Kingdom?), and that this could alwaysbe referred to if necessary.[26292]
2. Telegram 378 Remac from  Washington [dated the 22nd October).Carrier 518.Please see Embassy telegram No. 4750 of 20th October, which reports view ofUnited States Administration that there should be no publication until theCongressional enquiry has been completed. It is clear that the President and allinterested departments would object to publication in the meanwhile.2. As regards food-stuffs and raw materials, major questions are stillunsettled as regards the machinery or procurement, our right to screen, our rightto police exports unless and until the export white paper is superseded andpossibly date of operation. I am hopeful that these questions can be settled intime, but they largely concern Dominions and India, and cannot at present beeffectively discussed by Australian and Indian representatives. Acheson saidthat it would be a pity to announce an agreement in principle until these out-standing questions have been settled as it would be a painful fiasco if a hitchoccurred after agreement of principle has been announced. This seems sensibleto me.3. It is very desirable that any announcement when made shouldcover the three Dominions and India. Morgenthau&apos;s main objection in July seemsto have been that these Dominions and India had not yet agreed to afford rawmaterials, &amp;c, as reciprocal aid.4. Export white paper. We have made it clear that our offer about rawmaterials is not conditional upon the supersession of the export white paper, butit will clearly avoid great embarrassment. If such supersession could be agreedupon though not necessarily published before our offer to provide raw materialsis published. Magowan is hopeful that supersession will be agreed without unduedifficulty once Congressional enquiry is completed. Ree my immediatelysucceeding telegram.3. Telegram 379 Remac from  Washington (dated the 22nd October).For Chancellor of Exchequer from Llewlin :  Remac 378.Apart from United States Administration views set forth in Embassytelegram 4756. I believe that it would be a great mistake on our part to issuethe White Paper on reciprocal aid announcing our giving of raw materials onmutual aid until (a.) Export White Paper has been agreed.(b) Machinery of procurement of our mutual aid materials has been settled.2. Laughlin Currie, Plead of O.E.W. branch of O.F.E.A., has asked to seeme to-day no doubt upon (a)&apos; On which a temporary deadlock has been reached, and I will pursue.(b) With Stettinius or Dean Acheson at the earlist possible time.4. Telegram 277 from A ustralia to Dominions Office (dated the 2\st October).With reference to your communication dated the 18th October to theCommonwealth Government accredited representative concerning Reciprocal Aidthe Australian Minister at Washington has been instructed to convey thefollowing reply to the United States Government.1. Commonwealth Government has given careful consideration to therequest of the United States Government for the extension of Reciprocal Lend-Lease to include raw materials and food-stuffs imported from Australia as setout in aide-memoire handed over to the Australian Minister in Washington onthe 6th October, 1943.2. The Commonwealth Government notes that Reciprocal Aid renderedto the United States forces in the South-West Pacific area is deeply appreciated.Requests under the present agreement have recently assumed much largerproportions and for the present financial year expenditure is expected to reachclose on one hundred million pounds or one-sixth of our war expenditure.3. The provision of Reciprocal Aid under present arrangements and thoserequirements of our own forces and other essential commitments is imposingsuch a heavy strain on our very limited resources that we are already faced with
a serious man-power shortage which will be intensified as the Allied forcesbased on Australia grow and the demands under the present ReciprocalLend-Lease agreement increase. &quot;     *4. After a full examination of the present and prospective commitmentsthe Commonwealth Government feel that these commitments are so great andour man-power position so acute that Australia has reached the practical limitsof contribution it can make by way of. Reciprocal Aid. The CommonwealthGovernment is therefore unable to agree to an extension of Reciprocal Lend-Lease along the lines proposed by the United States Government which wouldcommit the Commonwealth in principle to the provision of Reciprocal Aid in anew field involving an unspecified number of commodities.5. It is recognised, however, that the circumstances may arise in whichthe United States Government would desire to submit a special request for aparticular commodity and in such circumstances the Commonwealth Governmentwill be prepared to consider at the time and in the light of existing conditionsof supply by way of Reciprocal Lend-Lease.
