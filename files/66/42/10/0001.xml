PART I, ALLIED NAVAL CONTINGENTS.French Navy.THE fusion of the former Free French Navy and. the ex-Vichy or NorthAfrican Force has now been accomplished and the combined Fleet, known as the&quot;Marine Nationale,&quot; is under the Command of Admiral Lemonnier, withAdmiral Auboyneau as his Chief of Staff, stationed at Algiers. The FrenchNaval Establishments situated in Great Britain and the ships operating fromUnited Kingdom Ports come under the sub-Command of Admiral d&apos;Argenlieuin London and this organisation is known as &quot;Forces Navales Francaises enGrande Bretagne &quot; short title &quot; F.N.G.B.&quot; Admiral d&apos;Argenlieu is also thehead of the French Naval Mission to the British Admiralty.2. The officers of the former Vichy ships are reported to be almostunanimously strongly pro-Petain. While they have not forgotten Oran andDakar, they appear generally to be prepared to sink any feelings they may haveagainst us in their desire to defeat Germany. The?-e undoubtedly exists, however,a great deal of ill-feeling towards the former &quot; Free French,&quot; whom they lookupon as traitors for their disobedience to Petain. Some elements amongst the FreeFrench are certainly anxious to keep their identity alive and most of them stillwear their Cross of Lorraine. Officers and ratings of the two former partieshave not, so far as it is known, yet been mixed in the same ship. It willundoubtedly be some time before these differences are really composed, particularlyamongst the officers.3. From reports so far received it appears that the personnel of the formerVichy ships are smart and well disciplined and that the majority of the ships arewell kept and should prove to be efficient units.Refitting of Ships.4. As expected, it was found that a number of these ships required refittingand modernising in the matter of A.A. guns. Radar, Asdic, &amp;c. Arrangementshave been made to effect these alterations as dockyard facilities permit in theUnited States, Bermuda and some of the French African ports. The mostimportant refits which have been completed are those of the Richelieu, the cruiserMontcalm, and the destroyers Le Fantasque, Le Terrible, L&apos;A Icy on and Tempete,The Richelieu is now doing trials and working-up in the United States.5. Refits are now in progress for the cruisers Georges Ley gives and Gloireand the destroyer Simouin, to mention only the most important units. It isexpected that others will be taken in hand as opportunity arises.Operations.6. The Montcalm, on her first patrol from Dakar, intercepted a largeSpanish merchant ship, which was sent into port for contraband examination.7. The Fantasque and Terrible took part in the bombardment of the Italiancoast in the early stages of the operations against Italy and also in the landing atAjaccio, in company with the L&apos;Alcyon, the Tempete and the submarineCasablanca. The Jeanne cVArc and the Montcalm subsequently landed reinforce-ments in Corsica.8. French ships based in the Levant have taken part in the operationsagainst the Dodecanese.Allocation of further ships.9. Four River Class Frigates completing between October and the end. ofthe year have been offered on loan to the French and will be manned by personnelnow in this country. The Naval Staff in Algiers have asked for destroyers,pointing out that their fleet is unbalanced by a shortage of these ships and thatthe necessary personnel is available. This question is understood to be underconsideration by CCS.Training.10.   A small number of French Fleet Air Arm personnel have already receivedtraining in this country.  Further officers and men in this category are availablein North Africa and the matter of their future employment is under consideration.[26236] B 2
Polish Nayy.11. The refit and rearmament of the cruiser Dragon has been completedand she is now working-up at Scapa Flow prior to proceeding&apos;on foreign service.The first reports received as to her efficiency are satisfactory. Before the shipleft Liverpool she was inspected by the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish ArmedForces and the British Ambassador to Poland took passage in the ship fromLiverpool to Scapa.Operations.12. The Submarine Dzik torpedoed a 5,000-ton tanker and a 6,000-tonpassenger ship in the Adriatic. Both are believed to have sunk. Later, operatingoff Corsica, she sank two merchant ships of 7,000-tons and 3,000-tons and threeSiebel Ferries.13. The submarine Sokol rendered particularly good service off Brindisiduring the occupation of that part of the coast. She organised the passage of anumber of Italian Merchantmen to Taranto.14. . The destroyers Krakowiak and Slazak have taken an active partthroughout the whole of the Italian operations.Royal Netherlands Navy.15. The Dutch Gunboats Flores and Soemba played an active part in thebombardment of the Sicilian Coast. The Soemba received slight damage fromgunfire and her Captain was killed off Taormina. The Flores also suffereddamage from a near miss.Successes.16. The Submarine Dolftjn scored a torpedo hit on a 7.000-ton merchantship between Corsica and Sicily and sank two A/S Schooners by gunfire.17. M.T.B&apos;s operating from Dover were in action against a convoy off theFrench coast.  One large merchantman was sunk.Ships Commissioned.18. The submarine Sturgeon, now building in this country, has been allo-cated to the Dutch in place of O. 14, which is not considered to be worth whilerefitting.   She has been renamed Zeehond.19. Four M.T.B&apos;s have been commissioned and have joined those previouslyat Dover, thus forming a Flotilla of eight boats.20.   One more Motor Minesweeper has been commissioned.21. It was found that the cruiser Sumatra could not be taken in hand forthe reconditioning which would have been necessary to enable her to operate inthe Royal Navy. She has been left at Portsmouth with a Dutch Care and Main-tenance party.Royal Norwegian Navy.22. The destroyer Glaisdale, in company with British ships, was in actionon the 10th July off Ushant, and enemy Torpedo Boats and R-Boats were engaged.Two of the enemy were damaged.23. Two of the M.T.B&apos;s of the 30th Flotilla attacked and sank a 4,000-tonmerchantman off Kristiansund on the 11th September.Ships Commissioned.24. The destroyer Success has been lent to the Norwegians to replace theEskdale, which was lost some months ago. She has been renamed Stord, and is atpresent working-up.25. Five Minesweeping Whalers, which were stationed in the Levant, havebeen paid-off and turned over to the Greek Navy. It is expected that theAdmiralty will receive a request, possibly for another Corvette to employ thepersonnel who have thus become available.
Loss.26. The Mines weeping Whaler Mandal struck part of a wreck off Falmouthand subsequently sank in that harbour.   It is thought that she can be salvaged.Royal Navy (Section Beige).27. The training has continued of the recruits who have become availableand a further two Motor Minesweepers will be manned early in October.Royal Hellenic Navy.28. Greek destroyers and submarines took part in the operations againstSicily and Italy.   The Kanaris received the surrender of Augusta.29. The destroyer Queen Olga was present with the British Fleet when themain body of the Italian Fleet surrendered. Commander-in-Chief, Mediter-ranean, made the Queen Olga a signal expressing his pleasure in having a Greekship with him on that day. Subsequently, when taking part in the Dodecaneseoperations, she was sunk at Leros.   Her captain and fifty men were killed.30. The destroyer Pindos was in company with the British destroyer Eastonwhen this ship sank a submarine in the Mediterranean by ramming. The Eastonwas damaged and Pindos towed her back to port.31. The submarine Katsonis was lost while operating in the ^Egean.German reports have referred to seventeen survivors.Ships Commissioned.32. The destroyer Themistocles (&quot; Hunt&quot; Class), having completed herworking-up, left for the Mediterranean in the middle of September.33. Five Minesweeping Whalers were taken over from the Norwegian Navyin the Levant.34.   The fourth L.S.T. has been manned in the United States.35. Six Fleet Tenders have been manned by Greek crews in theMediterranean.Ships to be Commissioned.36. The corvettes Coreopsis and Tamarisk, now refitting in this countryand due to complete in October, have been allocated and will be manned by theGreeks who are now completing their training at Chatham.37. The &quot; Hunt &quot; class destroyer Hursley and the corvette Hyacinth are tobe turned over to the Greeks in the Mediterranean and will be manned by the crewsof the old Greek destroyers Panther and Spetsai, which will be paid off.38. It is still under consideration to offer the Greeks three more destroyers,which would enable them to pay off three more old ones, the upkeep of which isperhaps hardly justified.*Royal Yugoslav Navy.39. The drafts which had been at Portsmouth and HALS. Royal Arthur forthe past four months, have now completed their training and will man thecorvette Mallow on the completion of her refit in October. After working up itis intended that she should proceed to the Mediterranean. It is too early to makeany remarks as to the efficiency of these Yugoslav ratings, but their morale is goodand they have shown much keenness to get to sea.40. The few men who were in excess of the Mallow&apos;s complement have been&apos;given training in coastal craft. A further 300 recruits for the Navy have beenreceived from the Yugoslav Army and are now in training in Egypt.41. The Admiralty have been asked to allocate ships for these men to manas soon as they are trained. Very few of them are of the seaman type, and theyare very short of engineers.  No decision has yet been reached.
42. His Majesty the King of Yugoslavia expressed himself as anxious tosecure the return of any of his former ships which might be recovered from theItalian Fleet, but none were so found.43. It is hoped that the release may be obtained in due course of a numberof Yugoslav Naval ratings who are now thought to be prisoners of war in Italy.Danish Contingent in Royal Navy.44. Progress has been made in the formation of the Danish crews to manthe two motor minesweepers. Out of over 100 volunteers, about 60 have beenaccepted by the Security Services and are now under training in FI.M.S. RoyalA rthur.45. Three more Danish officers have been granted commissions, R.N.R.,making five in all.46. It is hoped that the crews will be completed so as to man the vesselsearly in the New Year.47. When dealing with such small numbers it is difficult to find recruitssuitable for all the categories required.PART II.-ALLIED ARMY CONTINGENTS.General Remarks.48. The improvement in the general wrar situation has stimulated theactivities of the Allied Defence Ministers in their planning for the return totheir countries and the future organisation of their defence forces to meet themany problems with which they expect to be faced. The majority of the AlliedGovernments attach considerable political importance to their Contingents andrealise that they may wrell prove to be the main stable influence in disturbedsurroundings.49. The Polish, Czechoslovak. Belgian and Dutch Contingents are includedin 21 Army Group. The Norwegian Contingent remains under the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief. Scottish Command. The French Forces are underthe War Office. During; the last few months all the Contingents have carried outcollective training with British formations. The standard of training, theindividual efficiency and the morale and confidence of the &quot;officers and men hasmuch improved as a result of these exercises. The Commander-in-Chief&apos;s inten-tion is to maintain close contact between British and Allied troops in theirtraining and associations.50. The Commander-in-Chief is arranging for the artillery of the AlliedContingents to take part in exercises and practices with British divisionalartilleries to ensure that the training and procedure is identical, and that Britishand Allied artillery can operate together.51. Recent exercises have provided valuable experience of the requirementsof the British Liaison Headquarters attached to the Allied Contingents foroperational purposes. Many of the Allied Commanders and Staffs have acquireda useful knowledge of English and British methods and it is important thatBritish Liaison Officers should only be provided for duties which the Allies cannotwith certainty undertake themselves. New establishments for the British LiaisonHeadquarters are being prepared. All the Allies are training Liaison Officers tobe available for employment with British or United States formations.52. The morale of all the Contingents remains high and there have beenno political difficulties of any account. The general behaviour of the troops andtheir relations with the civil population are excellent. The continued goodbehaviour of the Allied troops after several years of inaction and anxiety andaway from their homes is in no small measure clue to the genuine friendship andgreat kindness shown to the officers and men of the Allies by all classes of the civilpopulation in England and Scotland.France.53. One parachute battalion has been formed at Camberley and trains with6 Airborne Division.   On the whole the battalion is doing very well and contains
many officers and men who have distinguished themselves in North Africa. Afew of all ranks are indolent and slovenly, and these are being replaced by bettermaterial. Many of the old French characteristics are still apparent, such as disin-clination to undergo rigorous training to fit them for the future. But wheninspired and on their mettle, they do well.54.   The personnel to form a second battalion in this country have beenselected in North Africa and are awaiting transport to England.Poland.55. The policy of the Polish General Staff is to organise their availableresources in this country with a view to their expansion, at the same timeconcentrating on their Armoured Division as being their immediate contributionto the Allied effort.56. The Polish Armoured Division (organised as an old-model division) hasbeen training for the last three months in the Newmarket area. A series ofexercises of a progressive nature were arranged by the General Officer Com-manding-in-Chief, Eastern Command. As a result of these the standard ofefficiency of the division has greatly improved and in the opinion of the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief is of a high order. The division had no previousopportunity of doing more than unit training.57. The armoured division has now returned to Scotland. The PolishGovernment have decided to reorganise the division to conform to the establish-ments of a British Armoured Division. This reorganisation is expected to becompleted by the 15th November, by which date it will be equipped with Shermantanks. The armoured units rendered surplus will be organised in a cadrearmoured brigade which with the existing cadre infantry brigade will form asecond armoured division in cadre form. The main difficulty facing the Poles isthe provision of sufficient infantry, but they are confident that the division willbe up to strength with first reinforcements by the 1st January, if not earlier.Some 800 Poles who have been serving in the German army and become prisonersin North Africa have volunteered to join the Polish Forces. These have beendistributed amongst units. They are well-trained and first-class material, andare reported to be very pleased with their new surroundings. More reinforce-ments from this source are expected.58. The Polish Parachute Brigade, organised in four battalions withsupporting arms, has been reinforced and is now composed of the best materialand is about 2,500 strong. It is reserved in the hands of the Polish Commander-in-Chief for operations in Poland.59. General Sosnkowski&apos;s appointment as Commander-in-Chief has beenwell received by the Polish army and all ranks appear to have confidence in him.He has made some changes amongst the Commanders and senior Staff Officers,&amp;nd has restored to office some senior officers who had been placed on the reserveby General Sikorski.60. The Allied successes in Italy are followed with enthusiasm by thePoles, but Russian progress is viewed with mixed feelings.Holland.61. The Princess Irene Brigade has been attached for three months to61st Division for training and has made good progress. The main weakness inthis Contingent continues to be in the senior officers, some of whom are old andlack drive and initiative. The young officers and the men are keen and enthu-siastic in their training. The relations between all ranks of the Brigade andBritish troops with whom they come in contact are invariably excellent.62. The Brigade has recently relieved the Czechoslovaks at Harwich, whereit has an operational role in the defence of the port.Norway.63. The Norwegian Contingent continues to train with 52nd Division inScotland.64. The Parachute Company has been attached to 6th Airborne Divisionand is reported to have reached a higher standard of all-round efficiency than theaverage in British units.
Belgium. u65. The Contingent has received useful reinforcements from the FrenchForeign Legion and elsewhere, and is well up to strength with a reserve. It isprobable that one or more additional units will be formed.66. The Contingent is at Lowestoft and responsible for the defence of theNaval Base, but although not in close contact with British troops, good traininghas been carried out in the Eastern Command. The Commander-in-Chief&apos;sintention is to move the Contingent to train in close contact with British troops.67. The Parachute Company has been attached to 6th Airborne Divisionfor two months and has done well.68.   The morale of the Contingent is high and it is free from politics.69. The Depot at Leamington contains a number of useless officers who areidle and more interested in politics than in their military duties.70. A small unit composed of Luxemburgers is being included in theBelgian Contingent by arrangement with the Luxembourg Government. Beyondwearing &quot; Luxembourg &quot; on their battle dress, this unit forms part of the BelgianContingent.Czechoslovakia.71. Progress continues in the conversion of the Contingent to an armouredbrigade with supporting arms. The armoured regiments have been equippedwith Crusader tanks. The Contingent has been moved from Llarwich to theKettering area, where facilities for armoured training are available. A consider-able number of officers and N.C.Os. have been trained in British armoured schoolsand have received very satisfactory reports. It is expected that rapid progresstowards regimental and brigade training will be made and great enthusiasm forarmoured training has been displayed by all ranks.72. Some 1,300 reinforcements arrived in August from the Middle East andhave been absorbed into units and are settling down well.French Forces.Location.73.

One battalion is formed at present and the second will be formed fromselected volunteers in North Africa and drafted to this country.76. In addition, the French have an O.C.T.U. establishment at Eibbesford,in Western Command, and a troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.

There being no area available which is suitable for armoured training inScotland, it is probable that the cadre armoured division will be located elsewhere,possibly at Catterick alongside the Polish A.F.V.

The reorganisation of units is now completed and preliminaryarmoured training is now proceeding satisfactorily.PART III.-ALLIED AIR CONTINGENTS.General Notes.Morale.124.   Generally speaking, morale in all Allied Air Forces is high.Tactical A ir Force.125. A considerable part of the Allied Air Forces in the United Kingdomhas recently been incorporated in this Force. In No. 84 Composite Group thePolish Air Force has 5 Day Fighter Squadrons, with 2 Airfield Headquartersand ancillary units controlled by a Polish Wing, and the Czechoslovak and RoyalNorwegian Air Forces each have 2 Day Fighter Squadrons and an AirfieldHeadquarters.126.   No. 2 Group has a Polish, a French and a Dutch Light Bomber- Squadron.127. Allied Day Fighter. Fighter Reconnaissance and Light BomberSquadrons outside the Tactical Air Force have been organised on a mobile basisto facilitate, if need be. their incorporation in the T.A.F.Training.128. Training of Allies is still being carried out on the lines set out inparagraphs 97 to 103 of the 25th Report, and is progressing satisfactorily.129. In volume it is growing, mainly because of the increase in the numberof French Squadrons which have been or are to be formed and maintained in theR.A.F. Target Force.130. Over 2,700 French Air personnel are to be brought to the UnitedKingdom by the end of 1943. and approximately 240 a month thereafter.   Nearly750 have already arrived.)&apos; .131. Arrangements have been made to give refresher and operationaltraining to the trained aircrews with which two Heavy Bomber Squadrons willbe formed and maintained; to convert to British methods trained maintenancepersonnel for these two squadrons and a Bomber Station and the other FrenchSquadrons in the United Kingdom; and to train pupils ab initio for aircrewin numbers sufficient to provide replacements for all French Squadrons in thetarget force. &apos;132. Technical Training Command have been made responsible for theFrench ground crews. For the aircrew personnel, a R.A.F. Station has beenestablished in Filey Town (Yorkshire) in Flying Training Command, withcapacity for 1,400. It will include an Aircrew Reception Centre and an InitialTraining Wing, and as a lodger unit, a Depot.  The last will be under the control
of French Air Headquarters in London.   The Station should be ready in earlyNovember.133. In the meantime, the nving personnel are being received, kitted, &amp;c.,at West Kirby in Technical Training Command, where the pupils for aircrewreceive preliminary training and the technicians are trade tested. The R.C.A.F.have assisted by accepting at Bournemouth the trained aircrew, when kitted,for refresher courses, for which there are no facilities at West Kirby.134. The Armee de l&apos;Air Authorities in North &quot;Africa have agreed to theselection of candidates for aircrew and the medical examination of all personnelcoming to this country being carried out in North Africa in accordance withRAT. requirements. They have been most co-operative, and the Air Ministryon their side are sending to North Africa a team of instructors to advise in theFrench Refresher Training Schools in Morocco, and a number of EducationOfficers to teach English.135. An interesting suggestion from the Dutch Authorities is also underconsideration. They enquire whether the R.A.F. will continue to grant trainingfacilities after the cessation of hostilities in Euz-ope, to enable them to rebuildtheir Air Forces for the prosecution of the war against Japan. It is probablethat most of the Allies will, in due course, ask for similar facilities for some yearsto come.Post-War Planning.136. Very naturally Allied Air Forces are striving to develop during thewar as many types of units as possible, and to have most of their personnel trainedfor the more highly skilled trades or for aircrew, so as to take back to their owncountries after the war at least the cadre of self-sufficient Air Forces. This hasbeen particularly noticeable with the Poles.137. Such proposals have to be considered, not only in the light of Alliedman-power resources, but also of the Prime necessity for first winning the warand of not lessening the all-important flexibility of the R.A.F.138. Two requests from the Polish Air Force, to have a large element in theTactical Air Force and a 3 years&apos; aircraft apprentices course for about 300 Polishboys, are instances of such that it has been possible to grant.French Air Forces.A rmee de I&apos;A if.General.139. The fusion of the De Gaulle and Giraud Air Forces is complete, andGeneral Bouscat has been appointed Chief of Air Staff. General Valin is DeputyChief of Air Staff and also Commander-in-Chief of the French Air Forces in theUnited Kingdom and U.S.S.R.R.A .F. Liaison Section in North A frica.140. A Section under Group Captain Rock de Besombes has been establishedon Headquarters, Mediterranean Air Command, for liaison with French AirHeadquarters in Algiers. It is to be the normal channel of communication betweenthe Air Ministry and the French Air Authorities.141. Following on the agreement to man two of the heavy squadrons ofBomber Command&apos;s expansion programme with French personnel, requests forfurther French Squadrons in the R.A.F. target force have been received fromvarious French Authorities. These requests are being examined at Headquarters,Mediterranean Air Command, in the light of R.A.F. requirements and commit-ments and those of the United States, and definite proposals will be submitted tothe Air Ministry.Operations (Home).142. Nos. 340 and 341 Day-Fighter Squadrons operated for 77 and 13,012hours respectively, destroying 11, probably destroying 3 and damaging 9 enemyaircraft.143. Since joining No. 11 Group about 6 months ago, No. 341 Squadron hasdestroyed 24 enemy aircraft for the loss of 5 pilots.
Com m itii/cation A ircraft.150. Five Wellington 1a Transport and 5 Oxford ambulance aircraft arebeing released for service in French Equatorial Africa.A eronautiqtie Navale.151. The Flying Boat (Sundei land) Squadron and the Coastal (Wellington)Squadron referred to in paragraph 112 of the 25th Report are now operatingfrom Dakar under Air Headquarters, West Africa. All the aircraft were ferriedto West Africa by the French crews operationally trained in the United Kingdom.152. Two other French Naval Squadrons (not part of the R.A.F. TargetForce) are operating from Arzew under the North-West African Coastal AirForce. All the aircraft are of French manufacture, except for four Walrus air-craft allotted by the Admiralty.153. Arrangements have been made to give operational training in theUnited Kingdom to French replacement crews for the two Squadrons based atDakar.154. Pupils for training as aircrew, other than Navigators and FlightEngineers, will also come to the United Kingdom for training ab initio. and it ishoped, but by no means certain, that French resources of trained naval aircrewpersonnel will be adequate to maintain these two Target Force Squadrons untilthere is a sufficient supply from R.A.F. Schools.155. Although the Aeronautique Navale is independent of the Armee del&apos;Air, naval personnel will be accommodated in R.A.F. Station, Filey Town (seeGeneral Note on Training above), and pass through R.A.F. Schools withtheir Armee de 1&apos;Air comrades.Polish Air Force.Operations.156. In Bomber Command No. 300 Squadron made 315 sorties in the quarter-year, and No. 305 Squadron 91 by early August, when it was withdrawn forre-equipment. In July the latter earned special credit by despatching 49 success-ful sorties and delivering for its size a one-flight Squadron the highest averageweight of bombs.157. In August No. 300 flew more sorties than any other Squadron in No. 1Group, but during the period has been mainly employed on laying mines in enemywaters (16 operations 305 mines laid).158. Polish crews have bombed Krefeld, Wuppertal, Cologne (twice),Aachen, Hamburg (4 times), Essen, Miinchen Gladbach, Foret de Mormal, andspecial target of S. of le Porte1!.144. No. 342 Light Bomber Squadron has flown 388 hours on operations.French crews in R.A.F. Squadrons have also given excellent service.Operations (Overseas).145. French units outside the R.A.F. target force have been operatingoverseas : in Syria, the Picardie Flight on desert patrol; In French EquatorialAfrica, the Groupe d&apos;Artois on convoying duty; in Russia, the NormandieSquadron on the Orel front.140. In addition, there are 8 Armee de 1&apos;Air Squadrons operating with thuNorth-West African Coastal Air Force. Two of these, equipped with Britishaircraft, have been engaged recently in Corsica.Morale.147. Morale in No. 341 Squadron is excellent, and good in No. 340. thoughthe Latter&apos;s sojourn in a quiet area appears to have caused some depression.148.   No. 342 Squadron has maintained improvement in morale.149. The spirits of the personnel recently arrived from North Africa arehigh, and an R.A.F. officer who has just returned from a thorough examinationof the Depot at Casablanca reports that the 700 pupils for aircrew training whoare to be drafted to the United Kingdom possess a high standard of physicalfitness, general education and morale.
159. In Fighter Command, the 7 day-fighter Squadrons, the one night-lighter and the Fighter Reconnaissance Squadron operated for 7,047 hours by dayand 127 hours by night, destroying 50  enemy aircraft, probably destroying 11and damaging 23. The role of the Night-Fighter Squadron has been changedifrom night interception to &quot; Instep &quot; and &quot; Ranger &quot; operations.160. In Coastal Command, No. 304 Squadron carried out 110 sorties onanti-submarine patrol in the Bay of Biscay during which individual aircraft ofthe squadron had a number of sharp engagements with Ju. 8ft, one of which isclaimed as probably destroyed and another probably damaged, and delivered a,heavy attack on a U-boat that had just submerged. What appeared to bewreckage came to the surface and the enemy vessel was not seen again. Althoughequipped in August with 600-lb. A/S bombs and M. XIV bombsights, theSquadron had no opportunity of using them. Later in August the Squadroncarried out operational flights by night, carrying flares and depth-charges, andearly in September was withdrawn for re-equipment on Wellington XIV aircraftcarrying Leigh Light, on which they will shortly re-enter the line.161. In Balloon Command, the Polish flight in Xo. 929 Squadron has satis-factorily carried out its duties on ten sites in the Xorth Queensferry, Inver-keithing and Donibristle areas.162. In Middle Last Command, the only Polish front line Unit is nowNo. 318 Fighter Reconnaissance Squadron, the Fighter flight referred to inparagraphs 121 and 122 of the 25th Report having returned to the UnitedKingdom. Xo. 318 Squadron, which only left England in August, is alreadyreported to have been employed operationally on convoy escort in the EasternMediterranean.Re-equipment.163. No. 305 Squadron was withdrawn from Bomber Command in Augustand transferred to the Tactical Air Force, where it is being reformed on 16 + 2Mitchell B. 25 aircraft. No. 1 Group have expressed their regret at losing thisfine Squadron, which has served with them for nearly three years.164. The replacement of Wellington XIII by Wellington XIV aircraft inNo. 304 Squadron has already been noted.M or ale.165.   Polish morale in Squadrons of Bomber Command remains high and ison average very good indeed in Fighter Command.   In No. 304 Squadron in&apos; Coastal Command morale appears to have suffered a little through lack ofopportunity to sight and attack U-boats, but still remains good and may wellbecome higher when the Squadron is once again operational with Leigh Light.166. Generally throughout the Polish Air Force the recent Allied successesappeared to have dispelled a tendency to be a little depressed.Development and Man-Power.167. The redistribution of the Polish Operational Units has crystallisedduring the period and for some time is likely to remain as follows: a PolishWing of five Day Fighter Squadrons and a Light Bomber Squadron in theTactical Air Force, and two Day Fighter, one Night Fighter and a FighterReconnaissance Squadron in Home-based Fighter Command; a medium (possiblylater heavy) Squadron and a special-duty heavy flight in Bomber Command; aWellington Squadron in Coastal Command; and in the Middle East a FighterReconnaissance Squadron.168. The inclusion of so many Polish Operational Units in the Tactical AirForce has led, or will shortly lead, to the disbandmeht of certain Polish ancillaryUnits and the formation of others. After certain conversion of tradesmen surplusin some trades to fill vacancies in others, the P.A.F. will have about 200 moreskilled technicians than their Establishments require (these will be profitablyi employed in Royal Air Force Units), but a deficiency of about 500 non-technicaltradesmen.169. As far as aircrew are concerned, there are in training a numbersufficient to maintain the present flow of replacement crews into Squadrons forat least a year, but there are only enough Poles in reserve to maintain the presentflow into Initial Schools for about two months.   The situation has been brought
strongly to the notice of the Inspector-General of the P.A.F., and there is reasonto expect that the Polish Government will order the release of 2,000 to 3,()()()Polish Army personnel in the Middle East for service in their Air Force.170. It is very doubtful whether the first batch can reach this country intime to avoid a break in How, but, should anything like the number suggestedarrive, the first batch in three or four months&apos; time, formed units can bemaintained for at least two years.171. Reference was made in paragraph 135 of the 25th Report to theproposal to bring 2,000 Polish women to this country for incorporation in theW.A.A.F. About 150 have already arrived, of whom about 40 have been trainedfor commissioned or non-commissioned rank.General.172. Air Vice-Marshal S. Ujejski, K.C.B., has relinquished his appointmentas Inspector-General of the Polish Air force and has been succeeded by Air Vice-Marshal M. Izycki, who until recently was the Inspector-GeneraFs delegate inthe Middle East.173. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to Poland has visited Polish OperationalUnits in Bomber and Fighter Commands.Royal Dutch Naval Air Service.Operations.174. Xo. 320 Squadron (Mitchell B. 25 aircraft), in the Tactical Air Forceof Fighter Command, has operated for 400 hours and sorties were on averagesuccessful.175. No. 321 (Catalina) Squadron, in No. 222 Group (Indian Ocean), is stillbased in Ceylon. The flight of six aircraft which had been operating in the SouthAfrican coastal area has now been transferred to Socotra and the Island ofMasirah (Persian Gulf) for anti-submarine patrol. It has been reinforced byan additional aircraft. The Squadron has suffered no casualties, and althoughstill below strength in maintenance personnel is reported to be keeping 90 per cent,of its aircraft serviceable.Morale.176. Operational morale in No. 320 Squadron has been high. The generalatmosphere in the Squadron has. however, not been entirely satisfactory and ayounger and more active officer has been appointed to command, and a Royal AirForce Wing Commander posted temporarily as joint Squadron Commander.Royal Dutch Army Aviation (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations and Morale.177. No. 322 Squadron (Spitfire) has been mainly engaged in training buthas operated for nineteen hours.   Morale has been high.Recruiting.178. Recruiting is still spasmodic and has recently fallen. The Dutch havenot been able to enter for aircrew during the period more than eighteen pupilsagainst a quota of thirty.Royal Norwegian Air Force.Operations.179. In Fighter Command No. 331 and No. 332 Squadrons have operatedfor 2,343 hours, destroying 24 enemy aircraft, probably destroying 8 anddamaging 14.180. In Coastal Command. No. 330 Squadron (Sunderland) despatched34 sorties on anti-submarine patrol which were 81 per cent, effective, No. 333Squadron&apos;s Catalina flight 30 sorties (mainly on anti-submarine patrol), itsMosquito flight 22 sorties on shipping reconnaissance off the Norwegian Coast,
during which two enemy aircraft were destroyed, one probably destroyed and onedamaged. One pilot brought his Mosquito safely home after its port enginehad exploded off the Norwegian Coast.181. The incorporation of the two Fighter Squadrons and the formation ofan Airfield Fleadquarters in the Tactical Air Force has been noted in GeneralNotes above.Morale.182. Morale remains high, especially in the Fighter Squadrons. It isperhaps not surprising that it should be a little lower in No. 330 Squadron. Twoyears&apos; service mainly in Iceland, then in the quiet area of Oban, and now in theShetland?, seems somewhat to have depressed particularly the Maintenancepersonnel, who have also been handicapped by the difficulty of maintaining theserviceability of by no means new Flying Boats and engines, under conditionsless favourable than those normally existing on Royal Air Force Stations. Anumber of sorties have had to be abandoned through engine failure.Recruiting:183. Recruits have not been numerous lately, a few only coming f rom Swedenand a few from Canada and the United States of America.The Belgian Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations and Morale.184. In Fighter Command No. 349 Squadron which became operational forthe first time late in August, has made sixteen operational sorties, No. 350Squadron in the whole period 66 sorties.   Morale is reported to be good.Recruiting,185. Ten officers have been commissioned and forty-nine airmen enlistedin the R.A.F.V.R. Ten trained, airmen have been attested in South Africa foraircrew duty and are on their way to the United Kingdom. It is probable thata considerable number of Belgian Officers and airmen of the Congo &quot; ForcePublique &quot; will volunteer for service in the R.A.F.V.R, in which case they willbe transferred to this country after training in South Africa.186. In recent months an increasing: number of Belgians succeeded inreaching this country from Spain and a further party is expected shortly.Reorg anisation.187. The Headquarters and Depot of the Belgian Military Aviation havenever been incorporated in the R.A.F.V.R. like the Belgian personnel in Belgianoi&apos; R.A.F. Squadrons, but this is now to be done. The reconstituted BelgianSection of the R.A.F.V.R. will be represented and controlled by a BelgianInspectorate General. A necessary amendment to the Anglo-Belgian Agreementwill shortly be submitted for Foreign Office approval.Czechoslovak Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations.188. In Fighter Command the three Day Fighter Squadrons flew 1,716 dayhours and 94 night hours on operations, and one Squadron 559 day hours onspecial operational exercises. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed and twodamaged, in addition, Czechoslovak pilots serving in Royal Air Force Squadronsclaim 5^ enemy aircraft destroyed and one damaged.189. In Coastal Command. No. 311 Squadron became fully operational onLiberator aircraft late in August and has since made 57 operational sortiestotalling nearly six hundred hours. The Squadron has had few opportunities ofdamaging the enemy but one aircraft, after a sharp engagement with a Ju. 88,which attacked with cannon-fire and killed, the Czechoslovak beam gunner, foughtback successfully and the mid-upper and rear gunners saw the enemy aircraftwith its starboard engine on fire and its port engine smoking, plunge into the sea.Morale.190.   Morale in No. 310 and 312 Squadrons is reported to be very good, thatin No. 313 excellent.   In No. 311 Squadron it has been well maintained .ih spite[26236] , , j
of the loss of three crews, including the Squadron Commander, within ten days.All round discipline generally has been good in this Squadron, both in the air andon the ground, aircraft have left for operations punctually, and the Squadronis reported to have settled down as a happy Unit.Unit Disbanded.   .191. The Czechoslovak Operational Training flight in Coastal Commandhas been disbanded, as all Czechoslovak Coastal Crews are now being operationallytrained in the Bahamas.Anglo-Czechoslovak A greement.192. The Foreign Office has replied to the Czechoslovak Government\srequest referred to in paragraph 103 of the 25th Report that the Anglo-Czecho-slovak Agreement should be reviewed and redrafted. It has been pointed outto them that the suggested withdrawal of the C.A.F. from the R.A.F.V.R. wouldentail the loss of many advantages they now enjoy. It is likely that this requestwill not be pressed, but that some modification in the uniform worn may besuggested, namely distinctive cap badges and buttons.Recruiting.193. Less than 50 recruits have been obtained during the period, andthere seems little chance of improvement.The Royal Hellenic Air Force.Operations and Morale.194. Both Xos. 335 and 336 Fighter Squadrons have been carrying outcoastal defence and convoy patrol duties in the Middle East, the latter takingpart in the raid on Crete on the 23rd July, 1943.195. No. 13 G.R. Squadron has also been operational in the Middle Eastand is. about to be rearmed with Baltimore aircraft. In general, morale liasbeen satisfactory, but the Fighter pilots are complaining that their Hurricaneaircraft are too slow for the tasks set.Genercd.196. Headquarters, R.A.F., Middle East, have told Headquarters, R.H.A.F.,that the formation of a second Greek Light Bomber Squadron must wait untiltheir aircrew situation has improved. The R.H.A.F. is particularly short oftrained Navigators and Wireless Operator/Air Gunners. The Greeks havesince asked to be allowed another fighter squadron instead, but it is not yetcertain that their resources of trained personnel could justify even this forsome months.Royal Yugoslav Air Force.Operations and Morale.197. A Yugoslav Fighter flight is now operating as part of No. 123(R.A.F.) Squadron. Trained Yugoslav ground personnel are available for tinsflight, but have not yet joined it as there is some doubt as to whether the flightwill remain with No. 123 Squadron.198. Until there are sufficient Yugoslav crews for a Light Bomber flightto be formed, individual Yugoslav Light Bomber crews are being posted for dutyto Nos. 55 and 203 (R.A.F.) Squadrons as they complete operational training.199. No report on morale has been received from the Middle East, but it isthought to be good.General.200. - The proposal to form a Yugoslav General Reconnaissance flightwithin a British Squadron has been found impracticable largely on technicalgrounds connected with naval co-operation; as indicated above, the aim will nowbe to form a Light Bomber flight. The Yugoslavs hope to obtain furtherpersonnel for ground duties from Slovene Prisoners of War in North Africa.
