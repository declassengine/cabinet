[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Weir Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. Copy Nq,W.P. (43) 496,9th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE PUNISHMENT OF WAR CRIMINALS.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.1. I am very glad that the United States and Soviet Governments haveaccepted with only minor amendments the draft I prepared about the local punish-ment of war criminals as a result of the Cabinet decision of the 8th October, 1943.By this means an enormous amount of responsibility for administering retributionwill pass from our hands to the many sovereign States who have been outraged andsubjugated and who have every right to be the judges of the treatmentadministered to those who have so horribly maltreated them. I consider thisdividing up of the responsibility and retribution work to be one of the most wiseand just steps which we in this country or in the United States could possibly take,for 1 am certain that the British nation at any rate would be incapable of carrying-out mass executions for any length of time, especially as we have not suffered likethe subjugated countries. The principle of judgment at the scene or in thecountry of the crime must therefore be considered most valuable.2. The second part of my policy and conception in regard to war criminalsis concerned with the major criminals whose notorious offences have no specialgeographical location. I submit to my colleagues the following proposal which,if approved, I would bring up at the forthcoming meeting of the three GreatPowers : A list shall be compiled by the United Nations of all major criminals otherthan those provided for by local jurisdiction. This list, which may be added to asthe war continues, should include the Hitler and Mussolini gangs and the JapaneseWar Lords.   I had not thought that this list of major criminals would exceed 50[26339]
or at the outside 100. Each United Nation will be invited to send in itscandidates. Many names will appear on all lists, and at a conference of juriststhe lists will be pruned and approved, additions being made from time to time.Thereafter the persons named on the approved list will, by solemn decree ofthe 32 United Nations, be declared world outlaws. No penalty will be inflictedon anyone who puts them to death in any circumstances. No country will beallowed to harbour them without incurring alienation in effective forms from thelife of the United Nations. As and when any of these persons fall into the handsof any of the troops or armed forces of the United Nations, the nearest officer ofthe rank or equivalent rank of Major-General will forthwith convene a Court ofInquiry, not for the purpose of determining the guilt or innocence of the accusedbut merely to establish the fact of identification. Once identified, the said officerwill have the outlaw or outlaws shot to death within six hours and withoutreference to higher authority.3. By this means we should avoid all the tangles of legal procedure, and theresponsibility for the execution of the outlaws would rest upon the decree of the32 United Nations, which constitutes a solid and unchallengeable foundation foran Act of State.w. s. c.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1.9th November, 1943.
