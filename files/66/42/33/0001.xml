1(83S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.6th Octoper,  19U3.Copy No.jyjjt CABINET ,WIDOWS&apos;  WAR PENSIONS AND GRATUITIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions.This memorandum refers to the proposals put forwardby the First Lord of the Admiralty in his paperW.P.  (1+3) K51, dated 13th October, 191+3.PART I.Retired Flag Officers re-employed asCommodores of Convoy.1.    Rank for the purpose of war pensions?  as set out inArticle 3 of the Order in Council, is.determined broadly by thesubstantive rank held by an officer when he was last on full payprior to the end of the war.    If, however, he then held a higherwar substantive,  or paid temporary or paid acting rank whichwould have been taken into account in calculating service retiredpay, this higher rank determines the rate of war pension.    Inaddition, if an officer was disabled whilst holding a particularrank, but returned to duty and at the time of the terminationof bis service was employed in a lower rank, pension is. assessed,by reference to the rank held when the disablement was suffered.On the other hand a temporary or acting rank, from which anofficer reverted before suffering disablement,  is not taken intoaccount for pension purposes.2.    Consistently with the above principles the Article furtherprovides that in the case of a retired officer re-employed pensionto a widow is assessed by reference to the rank in which he wasactually employed or to the rank appropriate to the appointmentwhich he held,3.    This is the provision which applies to the widows ofCommodores of Convoy, subject to the special alternativearrangement referred to in the third paragraph of the First Lordrsmemorandum.U.    These officers comprise a relatively small group and ithas alv/ays seemed to me difficult to discover any grounds onwhich their widows could be singled out for specially favourabletreatment.    Indeed the First Lord now agrees that any concessioncould not be limited to this particular class of officers, butwould have to be extended to all cases in which retired officersare re-employed in a lower rank.    The grading of widows1  pensionsaccording to rank is justified on the ground that it marks thevarying degrees of responsibility discharged by officers in theposts they occupied at the time of death.    In the cases now in   -question the officers were discharging responsibilities which theAdmiralty consider appropriate to the rank of Commodore.5.    IofficersFirstwouldam notservingaware of the total number of re-employed regularin a lower rank but acceptance of theLord&apos;s proposal, whilst it might remove one difficultycreate others.
6.    Many retired officers are serving in all ranks of theHome Guard from private upwards.    If they lose their lives theirwidows receive the flat rate pension of a member of the&quot;Home Guard(plus any non-attributable service pension to which they may beentitled calculated by reference to their husband&apos;s&quot; substantiverank: on retirement from the Forces).    This arrangement is thebasis of the &quot;device&quot; referred to by the First Lord,  adoptedas an alternative arrangement to ensure that the widow of are-employed retired officer was not in a worse position if hewas killed whilst re-employed than if he had been killed as amember of the Home Guard or *of the Civil Defence Services.7.    In addition there are many persons serving temporarilyin the Forces during the present war who served in a highercapacity in the war of 191L-18 and they might well fail tounderstand why credit for a higher rank held in the pastshould be given to the widow of the regular officer, butrefused to their widows.8.    Again when the time comes to &quot;organise&quot; countriesat present under enemy control no doubt many more officers(particularly in the Army) will be re-employed in a lower rankthan that which they previously held.9c    Whilst I fully appreciate the valuable services givenby Commodores of Convoy, this strengthens my feeling that therewould be great difficulty in justifying differential treatmentof their widows on the basis of former ranks which have nobearing on the responsibilities of their war-time posts.    Moreoverin many cases they did not give service as flag officers but werepromoted to that rank under an old naval arrangement.    I understandthat the present proposals would reflect the flag rank in thesecases.    I can see no justification for this.10.    Finally, the proposed concession would be likely to invite anagitation in regard to all hostilities personnel, whether officersor other ranks, for pension in the event either of death ordisablement to be assessed by reference to the highest rank heldat any period of service.    No such claim has yet been made andI doubt if it would on merits be seriously argued as reasonable.There are, however, certain elements who seek any excuse on whichto base a claim for increases in war pensions and it would be toomuch to hope that at some stage they v/ould not seek to use to theiradvantage what they v/ould describe as preferential treatment forretired regular officers.PART II.&quot;Killed in Action&quot; Gratuities.11.    &quot;Killed in Action&quot; gratuities are an anachronism justifiedonly on the grounds of tradition.    In the case of the Army theydate back at least to the middle of the eighteenth century andwere paid in respect of commissioned officers killed in battle.&quot;Persons dying of their wounds within six months after the battleshall be deemed to be slain in action&quot;.12.    The provision for the Navy in operation in 191U covered&quot;officers slain in the King&apos;s Service in fight with an enemy,v/ith pirates or&apos; smugglers or in encounters with the ships offriends by mistake, or in quelling disturbances on shore or afloat&quot;.13.    In 1915 the following Naval formula was adopted:&quot;Killed in action or died from wounds received in action,whether afloat or ashore,  or by destruction of ship, drowningor other violent death due directly and wholly to war service&quot;.
ll-l-. ,   In 1916 it was agreed that all cases of drowning on .sea service during the war came within the above.formula.15*    It was also provided that -&quot;killed in action&quot; covereddeath on flying duty, or while being carried on duty in: aircraft.This special provision&apos; was no doubt related to the&apos;abnormal risksof flying in its early days. &apos; N16.    When the Ministry of Pensions was set up. it: took over theexisting regulations.17.    The 1920 Post-War Disability Pensions Committee thenexpressed their views as follows:-&quot;If they had a free hand in the matter.,  the Committee&apos;would not recommend the continuance of granting gratuities inaddition to pension to widows in the srjecial case of officerskilled in action.     In the actual circumstances they are,however, unable to recommend that these gratuities should beabolished.    Apart from the opposition which-would be raised ongrounds of tradition and sentiment,  the Committee have to facethe position that, if the gratuities were abolished, it wouldalmost certainly be necessary to increase the attributable scaleof pensions as compensation, probably to a degree which wouldraise them too much above the intermediate rates for the GreatWar.    But while they consider that the gratuities should remain,the Committee would limit them&apos;in future,  if possible,  to casesof death In action and from wounds received in action&quot;.18.    In the peace-time code laid down after the last war itwas provided that the gratuity should be paid where the officerwas killed in action or died of wounds.    No extendedinterpretation-was given to the phrase until the outbreak ofthe present war.19.    Broadly speaking,  therefore,  the position in 1939 wasthat it was agreed on all hands that the &quot;killed in action&apos;&apos;1gratuity was an illogical anachronism,  that its existence was,however,  so hallowed by tradition that its abolition would bedifficult, but that if it had to be continued its applicationshould be strictly limited.-   In this connection it should beemphasized that over a period of some 200 years the only breakfrom a strict interpretation was in respect of the war ofI9U4.-I8 and that the extended interpretation was not continuedduring the period between that war and this.20.    The question has received frequent consideration duringthe last four years and in 1942 after discussion between theService Departments and my Department the Treasury decided thatthe phrase &quot;killed in action&quot; in the present War Pensions Ordershould be regarded as covering &quot;any officer killed whilst onduty or whilst proceeding to report for duty as the result ofan emergency summons, by:-(l)    A missile of any character discharged by theenemy or by our own Forces in combating an actual orimagined attack by, the enemy.(2)    An actual or presumed specific act on-the part ofthe enemy e.g.  the discharge of a torpedo or the layingof a mine.(3) An act on the part of our ov/n Forces whilst attackingor proceeding to attack the Forces of the enemy&quot;.Phis is the present position.
21.    The Service Departments propose that for the existingprovision there should be substituted. &quot;Violent death duedirectly or wholly to the special risks of war service&quot;.It is understood that this v/ould cover all cases in whichviolent death was attributable to service except that &quot;specialrisks of war service&quot; would be taken as excluding risks commonto civil life, such as traffic accidents.    Leaving asidefor the moment the question of the merits of the proposal, itwould in my view be difficult to apply the limitationsuggested.    Presumably if tv/o tanks on manoeuvres in the countrycollided with fatal results the gratuity would be payable,but if an officer on a motor-bicycle ran into a lorry on amain road his widow v/ould not receive the gratuity.    In my viewsuch a line of demarcation would create as many anomalies asexist under the present arrangements, if not more,  and itsdefence v/ould be no easier.22,    Basically there is no justification for any differencebetween payments to the widows of officers who are killed inaction or by accident or who die of disease due to service.23.    Special treatment in regard to cases where the officeris killed in action, as at present interpreted,  can be justifiednot on merits but on the grounds of tradition.    If, however,the interpretation is widened it then becomes necessary onmerits to justify preferential treatment e.g,   to the widow ofthe naval officer who is washed overboard in a heavy sea overthe widow whose husband dies of pneumonia brought on byexposure under similar conditions.2i-L.    Moreover,  any extension would invite a host ofconsequential claims.    The Merchant Navy,  to whom killed inaction gratuities are not payable, has acquiesced in thepresent position on the grounds of tradition.    If there is tobe a break with tradition they would be bound to raise thematter afresh.25.    Again,  if a special gratuity is to be given to thev/idows of all officers who meet with a violent death,  this mustrevive the claim for similar treatment in regard to other ranks.Whatever may have been the position in the past the presentHouse of Commons has been critical of what can be describedas preferential treatment for officers.26.    Finally any widening of the existing &quot;killed in action&quot;arrangements would invite a claim for a revival of the illogicalwound gratuity.27.    To sum up, my view is that the present position isadmittedly illogical,  that the &quot;killed in action&quot; gratuity isunjustified on merits,  that on grounds of tradition it cannotimmediately be terminated,  that its application should not bewidened, that any widening would create at least as manyanomalies as it would remove,  and that a number of consequentialclaims, not now being made on merits, would be advanced on thebasis of analogy.W.
