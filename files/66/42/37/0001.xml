DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 487.4th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.    ^ETHIOPIA.Memorandum by the Deputy Minister of State Resident in the Middle East..1. At their Meeting on the 19th July, 1943 (W.M. (43) 101st Conclusions,.Minute 3), the War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 317), to which were attached inter aliacopies of two telegrams from me dated the 4th and the 14th July, 1943, in whichI drew attention to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Ethiopia which \was:developing under the existing Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement, and recommendedthe negotiation of a fresh Agreement which would serve the double purposeof improving the administration and of providing for our long-term objectives,in Ethiopia and on its frontiers. As a result of the War Cabinet&apos;s discussions,I received a telegram in which I was invited to rough out the headings forarticles of an alternative Agreement, counting the cost in money and man-power.I was also invited to indicate where in my view, the present Agreement had failedto serve our major interests and in what matters materially affecting us theEmperor had failed to keep his engagements.2. Circumstances have greatly changed since the present Agreement withthe Emperor was made. At that time the security of the Middle East was farfrom assured and we were faced with great dangers in many parts of the world.It was, therefore, necessary to divest ourselves of responsibility for the internaladministration of Ethiopia and be free from commitments in that country. . Thepolicy adopted summed up in the phrase that His Majesty&apos;s Government didnot conceive themselves as having any civilising mission to exercise in Ethiopia has, indeed, been successful in freeing us for two years from major anxieties inEthiopia and enabling us to prosecute the war without backward glances towardsAddis Ababa.3. We may now consider the Agreement in the light of experience. In thefirst place the Emperor has already indicated that he wishes to discuss futurearrangements; in this connection it may be mentioned that he is entitled to endthe Agreement by giving three months&apos; notice on or after the 31st January, 1944vand substitute for it. a long-term arrangement. In the second place, a phaseof the war has now been reached in which it is possible to plan more securely forthe future. Finally, even though we have been able so far to avoid any majordistractions in Ethiopia, experience of the working of the Agreement has revealedgrounds for serious apprehension about the administration of the country andour relations with the Emperor.4. The degree of mal-administration under the Emperor&apos;s rule and theextent to which intervention to secure improvement is necessary or possible: arematters of opinion and controversy.   But I believe it will be agreed that: -(a) Internal disorder has increased.   The unsatisfactory position on theEthiopian-Kenya frontiers was recently brought to the notice of theWar Cabinet (W.M. (43) 127th Conclusions, Minute 8) and it wasdecided to make strong representation to the Emperor.   Still more,recently  disturbances in  the  Tigrai have  assumed such  serious,proportions as to necessitate the intervention of the R.A.F.(b) The method of independent advisers has been disappointing in itsresults.[26324]
(c) The administration of justice is tarnished, by grave abuses and theconditions in some of the prisons are reported to be appalling.(d) Road communications important to the economy and security of thecountry are being completely neglected.These things alone justify, I suggest, investigation and a reconsideration ofour attitude towards the Emperor and his Government.5. The long-term interests of His Majestv&apos;s Government in Ethiopia weredefined in Foreign Office Paper J. 365/66/1 of the 20th January, 1942, asfollows : (1) An independent Ethiopia on Imperial Defence grounds.(2) Control of the water issuing from Lake Tsana by a barrage under thedirection of the Sudan Government.(3) Treaty arrangements safeguarding the tributaries of Blue and WhiteNiles.(4) The British protected tribes in Somaliland to enjoy unimpeded use oftheir habitual grazing grounds across the frontier into Ethiopianterritory.(5) Minor frontier adjustments on the border of British Somaliland, Kenyaand the Sudan for better administration.(6) Open door for trading.In addition to the aims set out above I believe it would be desirable to secure theunion of the whole Somali population under one administration by means of someform of United Nations control over British and Italian Somalilands and part ofthe Ogaden Province of Ethiopia.6. To obtain satisfaction from the Emperor on our long-term aims will notbe easy. An inducement which might be expected to make a considerable appealto him would be the cession of the Danakii Coast including the port of Assab andof the Northern Tigrai including, perhaps, the town of Asmara. I feel stronglythat it would be impossible to cede these territories to Ethiopia unless we weresatisfied that there was a prospect of orderly government in that country, and Ibelieve that, on this ground apart from other considerations the internaladministration of Ethiopia is a matter of interest to His Majesty&apos;s Government.7. It is not possible, without further investigation on the spot, to suggestwith any confidence ways in which we might seek to improve Ethiopianadministration. I certainly do not advocate, and have never advocated, settingup a Protectorate. But we cannot, in my view, remain content with a method ofadvisers under which the failure of the Emperor to take advice has been sogeneral that the advisers were recently with difficulty prevented from resigningin a body.   Measures of improvement which might be considered are : (a) An agreement with the Emperor on a ten-year plan for the developmentof the country and laying the foundations of a sound administration;(b) Payment during the period of the plan of an annual subvention to theEmperor of from  750,000 to  1,000,000 for current expenditure and- the development of economic resources.(c) The institution of an Adviser System by giving the Emperor theguidance of a Chief Adviser, assisted by three Prinicpal Advisers forthe Departments of the Interior, Finance and Justice.(d) The Emperor to have, in addition, the assistance of subordinate Advisersand departmental executives.(e) All payments out of the subvention to require the approval of the ChiefAdviser, who would be empowered to withhold payment if the Emperor   Ineglected advice on important matters.(/) A military convention defining the military support we are able to promisethe Emperor and providing for either a British Military Mission orthe employment of British Military Advisers.8. Until the peace settlement with Italy it may be necessary to postponeterritorial adjustments, but it should be possible to provide that any financialinducements such as suggested in paragraph 7 above be liable to be terminatedbefore the full period of a new arrangement in case agreement on any mattersthus postponed cannot be reached at the time of the peace settlement. In thiscase, so as not to lose the inducement of the first stage of the plan, the Lake Tsanaconcession might form part of the initial agreement.
9. I hope that if sound proposals could be worked out on these or similarlines we should be prepared to find the money, but I recognise that there wouldbe great difficulty in finding the men. America might, however, be ready to helpin both respects.10. I have set down these suggestions as an indication of what I believeto be the possibilities, but I think it would be premature to take decisions uponthem with our present insufficient information. I therefore recommend thecourse proposed by Mr. Casey during his last visit to England -namely, thatappropriate officials should be sent as soon as possible to Addis Ababa to discussthe whole position with His Majesty&apos;s Minister, the Advisers and the Emperorhimself. The discussions would pave the way for a Treaty to replace the presentAgreement, and would cover both our long-term aims and the best means ofensuring co-operation with the Emperor in the improvement of internaladministration.11. It is obviously most desirable that proposals for a new agreement shouldcome, so far as possible, as suggestions from the Emperor instead of being pressedupon him by us. That is why I believe the next step should be to send officialsto Addis Ababa to have frank discussions with the Emperor and then give HisMajesty&apos;s Government an accurate report on the present state of affairs. Sucha mission would, however,, be pointless if it had been decided in advance thatwe must, in any case, adhere to the policy of disinteresting ourselves altogetherfrom the internal affairs of Ethiopia.12. Accordingly I submit for the consideration of the War Cabinet thefollowing suggestions :  (a) That our policy towards Ethiopia should now be reviewed.(b) That it should be accepted for the purpose of the review that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have an interest in the orderly government ofEthiopia and would be ready, if reasonable proposals are made, toassist the Emperor in developing his country and laying, the founda-tions of a sound administration.(c) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Casey shouldbe invited to send appropriate officials to Addis Ababa as soon aspossible with instructions (i) To discuss the present position in Ethiopia with His Majesty&apos;sMinister, the Advisers and the Emperor,(ii) To report to His Majesty&apos;s Government on the existing state ofaffairs and on the best means of attaining our long-term aimsand assisting the Emperor to develop his country and improveits administration.(Initialled) M.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,ith November, 1943.
