DEMOBILISATION COMMITTEE.Report.AT their meeting on the 4th August, 1943 (W.M. (43). 111th Conclusions),the War Cabinet appointed this Committee &quot; to carry out a general survey of ourdemobilisation plans on the basis of a two-stage ending of the war.&quot; The Inter-Departmental Committee on the Machinery of Demobilisation presented tworeports dated respectively the 22nd May, 1941, and the 9th October, 1942. TheOfficial Committee on Post-War Internal Economic Problems produced a report,dated the 16th October, 1942, on the Demobilisation and Resettlement of Labour.These three documents were submitted by the Minister without Portfolio (thenPaymaster-General) to the War Cabinet on the 16th November, 1942,* andreceived general approval.t2. As regards the demobilisation of the Armed Forces, our task has been toreview7 the scheme submitted in the reports of the Inter-Departmental Committeein the light of later developments and of the further work of the Service Depart-ments on the subject and with special reference to the possibility of a continuanceof the war against Japan for some time after hostilities have ceased in Europe.We should, however, explain that the scheme of demobilisation we recommend isof general application and is not dependent on the war so continuing nor on therate of demobilisation being as slow as that assumed in para. 9. It is notintended to apply to Colonial troops : their demobilisation must be governed bylocal circumstances. So far as concerns the release and resettlement of men andwomen held under compulsory powers on civilian work or in the civil defenceservices, we find that plans are still in course of preparation and that furtherprogress is largely dependent on a number of major decisions yet to be taken onmatters mostly outside our terms of reference. One dominating issue, however,which has an intimate bearing on all demobilisation is the continuance of compul-sory service either in the military or the civil sphere, and we deal very brieflywith this in the later sections of our report.3. Generally speaking, we have conceived it to be our duty to concernourselves only with the broad principles of the demobilisation plans, not withtheir detailed application. Many difficult points will arise in working, out thedetails of military demobilisation, requiring the continuance of the present closeco-ordination between the Services and with the Ministry of Labour and NationalService. The need for continued study and adaptation of plans to the course ofevents is, however, even greater in the civil sphere, for in the absence of thecohesive force of milita^ discipline any plans that may be made now for therelease of war workers and the Civil Defence Services must be much influenced bythe trend of public opinion. They must also be interlocked with the plans forplacing in employment as soon as possible it may be after special training ofthe men and women who are released from war service, whether in the ArmedForces or otherwise. Once the broad lines of Government policy in these mattershave been laid down, its consistent application would appear to require the super-vision of a strong co-ordinating committee which might have a ParliamentarySecretary of the Ministry of Labour and National Service as Chairman.4. We wish to acknowledge the generous assistance which we have receivedthroughout our enquiry from the various departments concerned but especiallyfrom the heads of the three Services (including the Women&apos;s Services) dealingwith personnel, from their staffs and from representatives of the Ministry ofLabour and National Service.I. Military Demobilisation.5. In our discussions we have found complete acceptance of two essentialconditions of any scheme of military demobilisation : &apos;(a) That it must be subject to overriding military and international needs,the rate of demobilisation inter alia being governed by operationalrequirements and not by the availability of civil employment.* W.P. (42) 498. f W.M. (42) 155th Conclusions, para. 5.[26440] B 2
(b) That the scheme should not only be fair and reasonable, but should onthe whole be accepted as such both by the men and women concernedand by the general public.Military Needs.6. Whilst the release of a man from the Forces must always be subject tomilitary needs, we agree with the Service representatives that the invocationof this principle must be kept to a minimum if widespread discontent on thisscore is to be avoided. The three Services will, however, be very differently placedin this respect during any interval between the end of hostilities in Europe andin the Far East. This country is pledged at the end of hostilities in Europe togive all possible assistance in the prosecution of any continuing war againstJapan. Detailed examination is being given by all three Services to what thisentails, but it will be some time before a full appreciation is available.7. In the meantime the Admiralty do not know what reductions, if any, itwill be possible to make in the Navy during this period, nor, if reductions arepossible, whether any part of the whole scheme now recommended can be appliedwithout excessive use of the military needs clause in order to ensure the retentionof trained and experienced officers and men. They feel that it may, in fact, benecessary to select almost entirely on purely service grounds the individuals tobe released during this period. Even when the time comes for a more generalreduction of our naval forces it is not anticipated that it will be possible to applythe general demobilisation scheme with anything like the same uniformity as inthe Army.8. The position in regard to any demobilisation of the Royal Air Force, bothafter a European armistice and subsequently, would seem to present some analogieswith the Navy. There is similar uncertainty at present as to the size of the forceswhich it will be possible to bring to bear on operations in the Far East and therewill be the same need to think of demobilisation in terms of service unitsor &apos;&apos; trades !&quot; rather than of individuals.9. With the Army the prospects of this period are somewhat clearer, thoughstill very uncertain. It seems highly improbable that the part to be assigned tothis country in active operations in the Far East can involve more than a smallpart of our total Army. For the rest, the main tasks falling to. the Army will bethe occupation of enemy territories and the maintenance of considerable securityforces in other countries, including India. How large this task will be and howlong it will last will, of course, depend very much on the part to be played byRussia and the United States and on the general character of the post-warsettlement.. As a provisional working hypothesis the Chiefs of Staff havesuo-o-ested that the Army might be reduced by 500,000 during the first six monthsDO v o -1-1-1after demobilisation starts and by a further 500,000 during the next six months.These are net figures and the number of men who might be released would beincreased by new trained recruits becoming available in replacement.10. The question of applying any scheme of demobilisation to all sectionsof the Army wherever situated is likely to present very considerable difficultiesduring the period between a European armistice and the end of hostilities againstJapan. While no great difficult)&apos; is anticipated as regards the units then inEurope, it would obviously be unsound to demobilise any considerable proportionof those engaged in active operations against Japan and, indeed, any such actionmay give rise to keen criticism both in America and in the Dominions. Further-more, shortage of transport will impose strict limits on the numbers that can bereleased in distant theatres generally. The Army authorities hope to reduce thesize of this problem very considerably by suitable selection, where possible, of thepersonnel of the units to fight against Japan and by the progressive return to thiscountry during the war of men of long service overseas. And such return will, ofcourse, be facilitated if there is an interval of three months or so, as mentionedin para. 13, after a European armistice before demobilisation begins.11. Nevertheless, we think it would be unduly optimistic to assume thatthe difficulty can be entirely eliminated, and rather than keep the bulk of theArmy waiting for demobilisation until the Forces in distant theatres can comeinto line, we think it would be better to make it clear from the outset that, whileevery effort will be made to secure uniformity of demobilisation, military needsand limitations of transport are bound to make it necessary to proceed somewhatmore slowly in.some theatres.
12.   In so far as it is necessary to retain on grounds of military need, eitherfor active service in the Far East or for duty elsewhere, men who would otherwise ,be entitled to demobilisation, we trust that consideration will be given to the /possibility of providing compensation in some form, e.g., by improving pay during/service or by gratuities on its termination.   It is anticipated that this will apply/with particular force to the Navy, in which the proportion retained owing to:military needs is likely to be considerable.  This question is, of course, linked withthe terms on which other personnel (preferably volunteers) are to be employed inthe Army of Occupation and our post-war forces generally; a matter which islikely to come up for consideration in the near future.13. In order that the demobilisation scheme may be applied equitably theWar Office attach great importance to there being an interval of three months possibly less after the end of hostilities in Europe before starting generaldemobilisation. This interim period would be a time of intense movement, bothof units and individuals; movement of units to occupy parts of Europe or theMiddle East, movement of units or drafts to strengthen our forces in the Far Eastor to facilitate the return home of high priority men; a time also of retraining fornew duties of men in low demobilisation categories serving in units no longerneeded, and so on.14. We feel bound, however, to record the view that so long a delay as threemonths in starting demobilisation, and so slow a rate of release as only 500,000 inthe next six months, and a possible 500,000 in the succeeding six months will comeas a great disappointment both to the Forces and to the public. We appreciate,of course, the difficulties, both transport and administrative, of any extensive andrapid release of men from the Forces, and we recognise that Government policymust in this matter be governed very largely by the course of events, and thateven after the end of hostilities in Europe this country must be prepared tomaintain large forces if it is to play an important part in European resettlement.But we trust that in giving due weight to such considerations full regard will alsobe paid to the importance of a speedy demobilisation to the country, economically,socially and politically.15. Assuming, however, as we must, that for the reasons given above,demobilisation will, in all probability, on this occasion be neither very rapidnor very extensive, we trust that opportunities will be taken to educate opinionaccordingly, both in the Forces and among the general public; otherwise therewill be serious danger of a repetition of the unfortunate occurrences after thelast War.16. Special difficulty may arise in all three Services over the retention ofmen in those branches of the Forces which are clearly no longer needed, particu-larly men who are not going to be transferred to other duties. It is not anticipatedthat these men will be numerous, and provided they are given necessary work, eventhough it be temporary, such as clearing up, sorting out surplus, restoration ofsites, &amp;c, we do not anticipate serious complaint. Economic conditions in thecivil&apos;sphere will be difficult for a time owing to the changing over of part of ourproduction machinery to peace-time needs, and some of the men may even be gladto have their discharge delayed a few weeks.17. It has been frequently suggested, notably in the recent report of theConservative Sub-Committee on Demobilisation and Resettlement, that thedischarge of men and women from the Forces should in fact be regulated by thestate of the labour market, irrespective of whether there is any continuingmilitary need for their services, and there is obvious force in the objection toallowing large numbers of demobilised men and women to go at once on tounemployment benefit or assistance. iNevertheiess, after consultation with theService Departments, the Inter-Departmental Committee came to the conclusionthat any delay in demobilisation on this account would be resented by the men andwomen concerned, and would be highly detrimental to Service morale anddiscipline.   Our own enquiries entirely confirm their rejection of the proposal.18. Careful consideration should, however, be given to an alternativemethod of dealing with this problem, recently proposed by the Minister of Labourand National Service. This provides for the grant of three months&apos; furlough, onfull pay and allowances, to all Service personnel on discharge as a sort of freeholiday Avith pay on completion of their military service. No dcubt many of themwould take advantage of openings for employment that came their way during
this period, but this should not entail the cessation of pay during the furlough, orthe arrangement would become barely distinguishable from an out of workdonation. We understand that the proposal of the Minister of Labour andNational Service is being examined by the Treasury and the other Departmentsconcerned in its relationship to the whole range of problems connected withresettlement on demobilisation.The Framing of an Acceptable Scheme.19. If the demobilisation scheme is to be acceptable to those principallyconcerned it must: aim at simplicity, and it must present as little opportunity aspossible for abuse by the exercise of personal influence. Thirdly, while it may bewise to retain until a later date a certain element of flexibility in some of its detailsso that it may be adjusted to unexpected changes of conditions, it must, when itcomes to be applied, be applied consistently.&quot;20. The House of Commons was given to understand in December last thatit would be given an opportunity to discuss the scheme before it was finally settled.We would suggest that it be promulgated to the Forces also, the reasons whichhave led to the several decisions being set out clearly. For this purpose use mightconveniently be made of the Army Bureau of Current Affairs (A.B.C.A.) and thesimilar organisations in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. This will assurethe Forces that all points have been considered, and they will be able to under-stand why certain things which they might wish to be done cannot be done. Anyrevision of the scheme which may result from the debate in Parliament wouldprovide an opportunity for taking account of any immediate manifestation ofopinion in the Forces.The Scheme of the Inter-departmental Committee and the &quot; Points &quot; Scheme.21. The scheme put forward unanimously by the Inter-departmentalCommittee on the Machinery of Demobilisation (which included representativesof all the Services) was based in the main on a system of priorities according toage and length of service, but certain limited categories were to be. releasedimmediately, and certain others were to be given priority of release within theirage and service group where this was of material value. Details are given inAppendix I.22. Since this scheme came before the War Cabinet in November 1942, anumber of special claims in relation to demobilisation have been urged in Parlia-ment and outside, and recently a wholly alternative scheme based on an elaboratesystem of &quot; points &quot; has been put forward in a report of the Conservative Sub-Committee mentioned above. This scheme is discussed in Appendix II. Aftergiving it careful examination in consultation with the AVar Office, we find it isquite impracticable in anything like its present complication and, in some of itsaspects, open to definite objection in principle. We have, in fact, no hesitation inendorsing the provisional decision already announced that demobilisation should,be based in the main on age and length of service. We are, however, disposed tothink that the detailed scheme submitted by the Inter-departmental Committee isneedlessly complicated, and that, in spite of its safeguards, it would in somerespects be unacceptable to the Forces.The Special Priorities of the Inter-departmental Committee.23. It will be seen from Appendix I that two types of priority wereenvisaged by the Committee, viz,, priority within an age and service group,and priority overriding all such groups. Priority of the first kind was to begiven for (among others) men having a guarantee of employment and married men.Probably no single factor contributed more to the demobilisation troubles of1919 than the grant of priority to those who claimed to Ijave an offer of employ-ment. While it might be possible on this occasion to guard against thewholesale abuses of that provision, we believe that any such priority would stillprovoke grave suspicion. As regards the married men, we have much sympathywith the desire of the Inter-departmental Committee to give them some prefer-ence and we believe that that desire will be shared by Parliament and the publicgenerally, but we do not think that priority within an age and service group isthe right way to give it. If, as we understand, these groups are to be muchsmaller than those envisaged by that Committee, priority of release within agroup will be of no material advantage and we recommend therefore that thisclass of priority be completely eliminated. We propose to revert to the case ofthe married men, and married women, too, later in this report.
24. This leaves only priority irrespective of group (Class A in Appendix I).Of the categories to be entitled to such priority, there can be no objection tothe inclusion of prisoners of war released at the end of hostilities in Europe(provided that military needs permit and that undue emphasis is not laid onthis privilege), or of men and women qualifying on grounds of extreme hard-ship, the system under which Commanding Officers deal with such cases beingnow well understood and generally approved.A special case arising out of a long-standing right of the R.N.V.R. toimmediate demobilisation as soon as hostilities terminate, will have to be con-sidered before the termination of the war with Japan. It had been originallyintended to give these men (900 officers and 11,000 ratings) priority of demobilisa-tion within the groups, but with, the disappearance of such priority theproblem remains and has particular importance in relation to the TerritorialArmy and the Auxiliary Air Force. It is not, however, one requiring immediatedecision, and we recommend that it should be further considered by the ServiceDepartments.The chief classes remaining comprise the pivotal men and special industrialgroups or occupations needed for reconstruction.Pivotal Men and Special Occupational Groups.25. Of the many problems that have to be solved in drawing up asatisfactory scheme of demobilisation none presents greater difficulty than thatof reconciling the national needs in reconstruction with the overriding conditionthat the scheme must be accepted as fair by those principally concerned. Muchof the difficulty arising after the last war will have been avoided this time bythe system of reservations, which has tended to retain in civil life many of thereally pivotal individuals and a high proportion of those in the skilled occupa-tions essential to the war effort. It is true that such reservations did not applyto Territorials and Reservists, but as these were mobilised on the outbreak ofWar they will probably, in any event, rank fairly high in demobilisationpriority.26. But apart from these classes the general effect of the scheme ofreservation as regards those called to the Forces, whether individuals oroccupational groups, has been to delay the enlistment of those most needed incivil life. Consequently, in so far as length of service governs release, a largeproportion of those now in the forces who will be urgently needed for reconstruc-tion will fall into the later demobilisation groups. The assignment ofconsiderable weight to age alongside service will correct this position to someextent in the case of pivotal individuals, as these tend to be older men, but itdoes little to secure the early release of men in occupational classes, such asbuilding operatives, who have been called up late in the War.27. We have received strong representations from Departments for therelease as soon as possible after the end of hostilities in Europe of both pivotalindividuals and occupational groups who will then be urgently needed in civillife. The Board of Trade attach the highest importance to the release of the menwho can most speedily carry through the large amount of preparatory workrequired before many branches of civil production can be restarted or expanded,whether such men are now serving in the Forces or working on munitions.28. When the factories are ready, the employment of the rank and fileof labour, both skilled and unskilled, will depend on the availability of suchkey individuals as managers, foremen, various technicians and specialists.29. Further, the Board of Trade point out that it will be hardly lessimportant to recover many of the commercial travellers and agents who keepthe factories supplied with orders. Under the conditions of keen demand ofthe transitional period this may not be an urgent matter as regards the homemarket, but it will be of great importance to our export trade. At the end ofthe War, opportunities will arise for getting into foreign markets which maynot recur for a long time.   We cannot afford to miss them.30. With the same objective of reviving our export trade the restorationof coal production will be a vital matter. Figures have been submitted to us bythe Ministry of Fuel and Power suggesting that the prospective post-wardemand for coal may require an increase of up to 150,000 in the labour forceof the industry.
31. A similar rapid and large expansion will be needed in the buildingindustry. The Reconstruction Priorities Committee have hitherto proceededon the assumption that 70,000 craftsmen and somewhat more labourers will beavailable for the building industry from the Forces in the first twelve months aftera European Armistice. On the basis of the demobilisation scheme recommendedin this Report we estimate that there would be released from the Armv, among thefirst 500,000, only about 18,000 out of the 153,000 craftsmen in the whole Army whowere drawn from the building industry, and only about 15,000 out of the 70,000labourers in the Avhole Army who were drawn from the building industry. Evenafter the release of 1.000,000 men from the Army, which it has been suggestedto us might take 15 months to achieve, these figures would only be raised- to42,000 and 34,000 respectively. To these figures there should be added a furthernumber, estimated at a few thousand from the R.A.F., and none from the Navy.The reductions must primarily fall on new housing.32. Again, the - programme of educational reform recently put beforeParliament will require a large expansion of the teaching profession. There aresome 26,000 teachers, nearly all men, at present in the Forces or in some otherform of national service, and it will be important not only to get these back as soonas possible but to train large numbers of young people of both sexes against theincreased future requirements of the programme. By 1945 it is estimated that theshortage in normal intake will have amounted to 11,550 men; an additional 7,500will be needed to raise the school-leaving age to 15, and some 10,000 men to staffthe young people&apos;s colleges. Large numbers of women will, of course, be requiredin addition. Other parts of the Governments post-war plans give rise to similarclaims to preferential releases on demobilisation.33. Special mention should be made of the Police service. Some 15,000regular policemen are now on military service, and &quot;although&apos;27,000 temporarywar reserve constables have been recruited to. make up for the 22,000 vacanciesarising in this and other ways, the effective strength of the Police forces isconsiderably below pre-war standards. In view of the uncertainties of the post-war period, the return of policemen from the Fighting Services as soon as possibleis strongly pressed by the Home Office and the Police authorities. This claim isnot challenged by the Service Departments, who regard the transfer of menfrom one disciplined service to their old posts in another as resting on quite adifferent footing from other cases referred to above. We think it right to brino-this matter to the attention of the War Cabinet.34. We have already given estimates of the number of building operativeslikely to become available in the ordinary course of demobilisation without anyspecial priority and we have had similar estimates prepared in other cases.The estimates involve many assumptions and the results may be greatly modifiedby the course of events, but for what they are worth the figures go to show thatthe numbers so becoming available will make only a small contribution to theurgent needs of reconstruction at home and to the restoration of our export trade.35. It will be seen, therefore, that a strong case can be made out for thepreferential release on occupational grounds of large numbers of men. Yet allthe evidence and advice we have received goes to show that the cumulative effectof such preferences may, as in 1919, be so serious as to wreck the whole scheme.Probably the only way to reconcile the needs of industry with a demobilisationscheme cased in the main on age and length of service is to speed up the processof release. With the emergence of the prospect of a two-stage ending of thewar it now seems likely that demobilisation must be spread over a long time.Indeed, as already indicated, we have been advised to proceed on the assumptionthat only 500,000 will be released from the Army in the first nine months andprobably much smaller numbers from the other two Services.36. The War Office have given us their considered opinion that, while thereaction of the troops to preferential releases cannot be predicted with anycertainty, it would be wise at the outset to proceed on the basis that such releasesshould not exceed 2 per cent, of the whole, i.e., 10,000 out of the first 500,000.Thev recognise that as demobilisation proceeds it may be found possible to increasethis&apos;number, but equally they recognise that it may, on the other hand, provenecessary to suspend such releases. They would be prepared to consider therelease of the Police not required on operational grounds as entirely outside thislimit.   We trust that it may prove possible substantially to improve upon this
figure of 2 per cent., although we realise that the release of named individualscannot do much to meet the case for occupational releases.37. The whole question of preferential block releases on occupational groundsis clearly one of great difficulty and of great importance. We all agree that,however urgent may be the demands at home for the return of men in these variouscategories, the maintenance of the discipline and morale of the Forces must bethe paramount consideration. In such a question some of us feel bound, to acceptthe unanimous advice of the Service Departments and are in consequence opposedto any block releases of men belonging to any particular trade or industry :whilst others believe that by a process of education through A.B.C.A. andthe similar organisations in the Navy and the Royal Air Force the men in theForces might be brought to accept the powerful case, in the national interest,for the early release, at any rate, of building operatives. They feel that itwould, in any event be better to test opinion in the Forces before deciding notto give the preference to building operatives. The Prime Minister himself in arecent speech has classed the provision of homes amongst the three essentials ofreconstruction policy.(Note: A reservation on this subject by the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Economic Warfare is appended to this Report.)38. In the case of the coalminers a considerable number of men have beenbrought back to the industry during the War both from the Forces and fromother employment and further steps are now being taken to withdraw, nominallyon a temporary footing, further coalminers from certain units of the Army stillin this country. If the course of military operations should make possible aconsiderable extension of this process of release of occupational categories it maylessen the difficulty. Experience in the last War showed how great was thedifference in the reaction of the troops to the withdrawal of such men accordingas there was still a powerful enemy to be defeated or not and we have no reason tothink that the position has changed in this respect.39. In any event, we would urge that men needed for the restarting ofindustry should be made available when required, even before the end ofhostilities if possible and certainly during any interval between an armisticeand the beginning of demobilisation. Individual releases, generally, when madebefore demobilisation begins should not rank against the provisional limit of10,000 proposed above.40. All such individual releases, wdiether made before or after an armis-tice, should be dealt with on the general lines that have been followedhitherto for returning men to civil life. These are set out in Appendix III, andit will be seen that each case is vouched for by a Government Department. Thisprocedure has worked smoothly and is understood and accepted by the Forces.If, however, the machinery is to deal adequately and expeditiously with theincreased number now in question, it will need to be expanded considerably both&quot;at headquarters and in the Regions. We have not gone into the question oforganisation in any detail, but provision must obviously be made for deciding thequestions of policy which will arise, and we suggest that this machinery shouldcome under the general direction of the co-ordinating Committtee indicated inpara. 3, major issues of policy being submitted by it to the appropriate MinisterialCommittee.Marriage. .41. The Inter-Departmental Committee recommended that marriage shouldbe a ground for complete priority of release for women who so desired, and this hasbeen endorsed by the Reconstruction Problems Committee,* the limitation, whichthe majority of the Official Committee desired to make, to women setting up a home,being eliminated. We admit that no sufficient case can be made out for completepriority in the case of married men, but, as already stated, we believe that somedegree of preference for these will be generally demanded, and we questionwhether it would meet with any serious objection from the single men in theForces. One complication should be mentioned. Many of the men now servingabroad were sent overseas without embarkation leave for reasons of secrecy, andthis undoubtedly prevented some of them marrying before they sailed.It is argued that to give a preference in demobilisation to married men wouldconstitute an additional grievance.[26440]* E.P. (42) 10th Conclusions, Minute 1 (2).c
42. We do not consider, however, that the admitted grievance of thissmall class would be accepted by the public as an adequate reason for refusing amoderate degree of preference to the whole of the married men in the Services, Inthe last war married men were preferentially treated in regard to enlistment; thishas not been conceded on the present occasion, but the general social, economicand political grounds for preferential treatment on demobilisation cannot, we think,be questioned. We recommend, therefore, that men married before the announce-ment of the Government demobilisation proposals should be graded fordemobilisation priority as if they were five years older, but not so as to bringthem within the category of men over 50 which the Inter-Departmental Committeetentatively recommended should constitute the first demobilisation group. Itwould obviously be undesirable to enable this preference to be obtained by amarriage after the Government announcement. We recommend also that the samepreference be given to widowers writh one or more dependent children, if this isfound practicable.43. One incidental but important administrative advantage resulting fromthe preference to married men would be to reduce very greatly the widedisparity in the size of the several demobilisation groups, as they work out underan age and service formula such as that recommended in para. 52.A ge and Service.44. We come then to the simple proposition that, apart from the case ofmarriage, the scheme of demobilisation should proceed in the main accordingto groups based on age and length of service. The question then arises : whatrelative weight is to be attached to the two factors, either uniformly or withdiscrimination as to the character of the service?Service overseas.45. The question of a special weighting for service overseas only arises asregards the Army : conditions of service in the Navy and in the Royal Air Forcerender any &quot;such distinctions in their case hardly practicable. There is undoubtedlya widespread feeling, voiced from time to time in Parliament, that Army serviceabroad, especially in theatres of active operations or under trying climatic condi-tions. should rank for demobilisation purposes on a higher level than service athome, and we have much sympathy with this view. We recognise that the casefor preferential treatment is far stronger for some overseas countries than others,but to our mind these difficulties of precise discrimination hardly provide asufficient case against some general weighting of all service overseas as comparedwith service at home. After all, any service abroad, whatever the conditions,involves absence from home, and this is. to our minds, one of the dominantconsiderations in the matter.46. This suggestion of a special weighting of service overseas has been verycarefully considered by the Army authorities, but they are firmly of the opinionthat as far as demobilisation is concerned such a course is not practicable. In thefirst place, it wrould of course increase the proportion of men now serving overseaswho would fall into the early demobilisation groups, and as regards sometheatres, notably the Far East, the numbers becoming due for release would in allprobability be greater than could on military grounds be spared, and quite likelymore than could be transported. The result in such cases would be that theconcession would have to be overruled on grounds of military or other necessity,and serious discontent would result.Secondly, it would be almost impossible to give weight to service overseaswithout counting all such service whenever it occurred. It will fall on theCommanding Officers of units to arrange their men into the proper demobilisa-tion groups, but it would be impossible to keep them supplied with accurateinformation as to the amount of service overseas of individual men in view of thefrequent changes of personnel in units. It is further argued that the case forany such special treatment of service overseas largely arises from the peculiardistribution of military operations at the present time, and that with the develop-ment of further operations on the continent of Europe, which may be expectedbefore long, much of the large force now held in this country will be sent abroad.Other units, or parts of them, may be brought home, and in these and other wayspresent inequalities of service will tend gradually to be smoothed out. For thesereasons the War Office have expressed their emphatic dissent from any policy ofdifferentiating between service overseas and service at home in deciding priority
for demobilisation. Furthermore, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry have both-stated that any such differentiation in the Army would have embarrassing reper-.&apos;cussions on their services.47. We realise the force of these objections; nevertheless, we do not thinkthey would be regarded by Parliament and the public as entirely disposing ofthis claim. There will be a strong demand that, if the claim cannot be fully met,-it should be met as far as practicable, and among the cases pressed for specialpriority in release will be that of men who, when demobilisation starts, will havebeen- for a long time continuously abroad. As suggested in para. 11, it maynot be possible in distant theatres, owing to military needs or lack of transportfacilities, to carry out demobilisation as rapidly as in Europe, but, in decidingwho should, be allowed to go first, special consideration might reasonably be givento the length of time that the man has been out there. We accordingly recommendthat, as regards the Army, but not the other two Services, a tour of service overseaslonger than twelve months, if still current at the end of hostilities in Europe,,should be counted in the age and service formula at the higher rate indicated inpara. 52.Other Service.48. In their final report* the Inter-Departmental Committee discussed themeaning to be attached to &quot; Service &quot; and came to the conclusion that &quot; there is areal difference between service in peace-time and service during the War,&quot; andthat military service prior to the 3rd September, 1939, whether on -permanentengagement or under the Military Training Act, should not count, and byinference that no special position should be accorded to Territorials or Reservists!They did not refer to the question which has been raised in the course of ourenquiry of counting certain forms of civilian war service for the purposes ofpriority in demobilisation.49. This question is one of some difficulty by reason of the great range in thenature both of such service and also of service in the Armed Forces themselves.Those in the Civil Defence Services who underwent the severe trial of thepersistent heavy air raids on this country during the autumn, winter and early&apos;spring of 1940-41 and subsequently joined the Armed Forces, could claim withsome justice that such service should rank at least as high as Army service inthis country in the conditions which have been met so far. The two difficultiesare (i) where exactly to draw the line, and (ii) how to co-ordinate the civilianrecords of such service with the Service records for the purposes of the demobilisa-tion machine.50. The proposals that have been put before us would allow a whole-timemember of the Police, the National Fire Service, the Civil Defence GeneralServices, the Civil Defence Reserve or the Royal Observer Corps who has joinedthe Armed Forces to count as war service for purposes of priority any period ofwhole-time service in such forces served since the outbreak of war. We could notjustify a concession on this comprehensive basis. We are advised by the WarOffice also that there would be very great difficulty in many cases in obtainingaccurate details now of the service in question. On the whole, we think that thefairest course is to disregard all non-military service, with the exception referredto immediately belqw.51. Perhaps the strongest claim is that of the 3,900 members of the FireService who after Dunkirk were released from the Army to take part in the civildefence of this country and were recalled to the Army when the emergency waspast. No difficulty arises as to the ascertainment of the precise period in thiscase; if it is allowed to rank as Army Service no break is involved. We thinkthat it would be reasonable to make the concession in this particular case alone.   tThe formula to be adopted.52. The illustrative table included in the first report of the Inter-departmental Committee was drawn up on the principle that six months of servicegave the same priority on demobilisation as five years of age, no discriminationbeing made as to the nature of the service. This table was, however, drawn upearly in 1941 and allowed for little more than three years of War. With thegrowing length of service a weighting on this scale would seem to attach too littleimportance to age and all that it tends to imply.   For example, it would put the* W.P. (42) 498, pages 23-4.[26440] c 2
youngest recruit., after &apos;2\ years&apos; service, much of which will probably have beenspent in this country, on a level with men in the oldest class that is now beingcalled up, i.e., those born in the second half of 1900. The age distribution ofthe three Services is by no means the same, but it is agreed that it would beundesirable to vary the weighting on this account. We recommend that each2 months of service should normally count as equivalent to one year of age, butthat in the case of service overseas in the Army, ranking for special priorityunder para. 47, each 2 months should count as equivalent to one and a halfyears of age.53. The first 21 demobilisation groups drawn up on this basis, but excludingthe special weighting for overseas service, the effect of which cannot be forecast,are shown in the table in Appendix TV.General.54. The above recommendations are also intended to apply to women andofficers in so far as appropriate. On other matters we are in general agreementwith the Committee&apos;s reports.The W.R.N.S.55. One further point we may mention which is hardly within our provincebut may nevertheless have some bearing &quot;on the success of demobilisation plans.The representatives of the Ministry of Labour and National Service called ourattention to the fact that the W.R.N.S., alone of the Women&apos;s Services, are stillon a voluntary basis, and they have suggested that this might lead to uncontrolledresignations on an embarrassing scale on the termination of hostilities in Europe.Any such exodus might also have serious repercussions on the other Women&apos;sServices. The Admiralty do not think, however, that there will, in fact, be anydifficulty in retaining a sufficient proportion of the W.R.N.S. or that theapplication of the Naval Discipline Act to the W.R.N.S. would in practice makeany appreciable difference in this respect. We are not convinced of the accuracyof this forecast. The traditions of the Navy are sufficient, without disciplinarypowers to secure loyal service in time of war. It by no means follows thatdisciplinary powers would not be required after hostilities have come to an endin Europe.II. The Continuance of Military Conscription.56. The extent to which it is possible to demobilise men and women nowserving will, of course, depend initially on the decline of military needs : later onit will also depend on the possibilities of replacement of men now serving byothers, whether recruited on a voluntary basis or called up under the NationalService Acts, either as members of new age groups or on being dereserved. Wefind that the Service authorities are counting on all three methods of recruitment,and we believe that this course is fully justified on grounds of military need, ofimmediate fairness and of long-term policy. While no decision has yet been cometo as regards the continuance of conscription after peace is ultimately restored,there is much support for such a policy and the possibility of its adoption shouldnot be prejudiced by any break in the continuity of calling up of new age groups.57. The calling up of men whom it is no longer necessary to reserve for warwork is more debatable. There can be no doubt that the calling up of the youngermen, many of whom have enjoyed a highly preferential position during the War,would be warmly welcomed in the Forces, and it would, we believe, meet withmuch approval outside, but we would emphasise that the case for it must rest,not on any idea of evening things out by giving such men a period in the Forcesirrespective of whether they are needed there or not, but on the continuingmilitary needs and the fact that it is only by calling up these men that others whohave served for a large part of the War can be released. It must, moreover, berecognised that a large part of the older men who have been reserved hitherto asbeing essential for war work will be equally necessary for restarting or expandingcivil production, and this should not be hindered. We recommend in favourof the principle that the calling up of younger men who can be spared or replacedin industry should continue after the European armistice, but we recognise thatit will be necessary at a later date to settle, in the light of the circumstances thenobtaining, the age groups to which it should apply.   The existing procedure for
granting deferment from service on an individual basis could be adapted to thenew situation, and would ensure that young men who.are still needed in industryand cannot be replaced would not be called up. It would probably be necessaryin any event to exempt all men employed in the mines.\HI.-The Continuance of Compulsory Civilian Service.58. Closely interlocked with the continuance of conscription for militaryservice is the question of continuing compulsory civilian service. In their reporton Demobilisation and Resettlement of Labour, the Official Committee on Post-War Internal Economic Problems came to the conclusion that the change-over ofthe economic life of the country from war to peace would best be facilitated,notwithstanding the possibility of considerable, even heavy, unemployment for ashort time, by not attempting to hold war workers in their employment after theend of hostilities. The possibility of hostilities continuing for some time againstJapan after they had come to an end in Europe was not, however, envisagedby the Committee, and the growing probability of such a development undoubtedlycalls for a reconsideration of this matter.59. The preliminary investigation that has already been made under thedirection of the Chiefs of Staff indicated that while war production needs maybe heavily reduced in some directions, other branches will have to be maintainedat full stretch. This will give rise to difficult questions of allocation both as toorders and man-power. It would clearly be highly detrimental to the war, effortto release all workers at once from control, and if conscription for military service-;is to continue for men who have not previously served in the War, this strengthens /the case for retaining control of those who are still needed for vital war work.We do not, however, think that it will be necessary to enforce such controls for Ilong if sufficient voluntary labour becomes available. If it were made clear toall concerned that every effort would be made to recruit voluntary workers asquickly as possible to replace such men and women desiring to be released, webelieve that it would be possible to secure general acceptance of the continuanceof war controls for a time on a gradually diminishing scale. The matter willadmittedly need careful handling and well directed propaganda, for amid thegeneral rejoicing over the defeat of Germany, the end of air raids, the lifting ofthe blackout and the removal of many other restrictions there will be great dangerof a complete breakdown of such controls. The Minister of Labour and NationalService has already opened discussions on the question with both sides of industry.60. The Civil Defence Services present a rather special problem in the fieldof civilian employment. It will be unnecessary to maintain the National FireService at anything approaching its present strength : the numbers to be retainedwill depend to some extent on the post-war organisation of the Service, but they willprobably be above the pre-war level. We have referred in para. 33 to the questionof restoring the pre-war strength of the police service. In regard to both servicesit will be necessary to retain some of the additional members recruited, during thewar, until the post-war permanent establishments can be built up. So long asemergency legislation remains unrepeaied adequate powers are available in bothServices.61. With few exceptions the need for the remainder of the Civil DefenceServices will cease at the end of hostilities in Europe, and, indeed, the characterof the war in Europe in its later phases may be such that some of these servicesmay be progressively reduced even before a formal armistice. The average age ofthe personnel is high, and few, if any, will be in the age-groups which may beneeded for the Forces. Nor will all of them, especially the married women, beseeking new employment; many will have work waiting for them. Of thosecoming on the labour market a number may be induced to volunteer for war pro-duction, thereby enabling other workers, held compulsorily, to be released. - Inthese circumstances we do not believe that it will be practicable, even if it weredesirable, to hold the members of these services after they are no longer needed.Those seeking new employment will, it is true, obtain thereby some advantage overpersonnel retained in the Forces, but the number will be small and this disparityof treatment will be a minor matter compared with that unavoidably arising inregard to the men and women who are released from munition production.
Summary of Report.I. Military Demobilisation.62.-(i) The scheme of demobilisation presented in this report, thoughdrawn up with a two-stage ending of the War specially in mind, is of generalapplication to United Kingdom Forces. It is not intended to apply to Colonialtroops (para. 2).(ii) Any scheme of demobilisation must (a) be subject to overriding military and international needs;(b) on the whole be accepted as fair and reasonable by the Forces and thepublic (para. 5).(iii) Pending further appreciation of the requirements of a separate Waragainst Japan, ho considerable demobilisation of the Navy or Royal Air Force isanticipated. As regards the Army, the Committee have been advised to proceedon the working hypothesis that demobilisation would not begin for about threemonths after a European armistice and that 500,000 men would-be released in theensuing six months and a like number in the next six months (paras. 6-9 and 13).(iv) Every effort will be made to apply the scheme of demobilisation uniformlyin all theatres, but military needs and limitations of transport to and from moredistant theatres will probably prevent complete uniformity. Consideration shouldbe given to the provision of compensation in some suitable form for those thathave to be retained beyond their appropriate demobilisation date (paras. 10-12).(v) So slow a rate of demobilisation is not generally expected and carefuleducation of opinion will be necessary as to the considerations involved : theimportance of speed in demobilisation is stressed (paras. 14, 15 and 35).(vi) The retention of men in the Forces, after all military need for them hasceased, merely because employment is not immediately available, would bedetrimental to discipline and is not recommended, but consideration should begiven to a suggestion for three months&apos; furlough on full pay on conclusion ofservice in the Forces (paras. 17-18).(vii) The scheme, as provisionally approved by the War Cabinet, should indue course be discussed in the House of Commons and promulgated to the Servicesbefore being finalfv settled. Once settled it should be applied consistently(paras. 19-20 and 37).(viii) The principle of release by priorities based in the main on age andlength of service is endorsed, the alternative &quot; Points Scheme &quot; recently put for-ward by the Conservative Sub-Committee on Demobilisation and Resettlementbeing rejected (paras. 21-22 and Appendix II).(ix) The special priorities recommended by the Interdepartmental Committeeare, however, regarded as too elaborate. Priority within an age and service groupis rejected as of no material value with the small groups contemplated (para. 23and Appendix I).(x) The special priority recommended by the Interdepartmental Committeefor Prisoners of War should be subject to military needs (para. 24).(xi) Three types of case for priority of release on occupational grounds areconsidered : &apos;(a) Individuals essential to preparatory work involved in restarting orexpanding civil production (para. 27).(b) Pivotal men needed for actual production (paras. 28-29).(c) Occupational groups of exceptional importance to reconstruction : coal-miners, builders, teachers, police, &amp;c. (paras. 30-33).(xii) Every effort should be made to release individuals in (xi) (a) and (b)when required, the former even before an Armistice if possible. Pending-experience of reactions in the Forces, a limit of 2 per cent, of the first 500,000demobilised is suggested by the Army authorities for such releases made afterthe commencement of demobilisation, though the Committee hope that asubstantially higher limit may be practicable (paras. 36 and 39).(xiii) If military conditions permit, the practice of returning men in specialoccupational groups to civilian life during the war might be extended, but theCommittee are divided as regards such block releases after demobilisation hasbegun, some members feeling bound to accept the unanimous opinion of theService authorities against all such block releases, others considering that men
in the Forces might be brought to accept the release of building operatives, at anyrate, as in the national interest. The attention, of the War Cabinet is drawn tothe special case of the Police (paras. 33, 37-38).(xiv) Such individual releases should be made on the lines of existingpractice for returning men to civil life, the machinery being suitably expandedunder an Interdepartmental Committee which might be presided over by aParliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and National Service,(paras. 3 and 40).(xv) Married men and widowers with one or more dependent children shouldbe treated for demobilisation as if they were live years older (paras. 41-43).(xvi) After examination of the arguments for and against special weightingfor service overseas as compared with service at home, the Committee recom-mend that a tour of service in the Army overseas longer than twelve monthsif still current at the end of hostilities in Europe, should be counted in the ageand service formula at the higher rate indicated in (xviii) below (paras. 45-47).(xvii) But they do not support proposals for reckoning civilian service (e.g.,in the National Fire Service or the Royal Observer Corps) before enlistment aswar service for purposes of demobilisation except in the case of certain firementemporarily released from the Army after Dunkirk (paras. 50-51).(xviii) The age and service formula proposed counts two months of serviceas normally equivalent to one year of age, but a current tour of service overseasin the Army qualifying under (xvi) above should be reckoned on the basis thateach two months is equivalent to \\ years of age (para. 52 and Appendix IV).(xix) In other respects the Committee endorse the conclusions of the Inter-departmental Committee on the Machinery of Demobilisation (para..54).(xx) The peculiar position of the W.R.N.S. as a voluntary force may lead todifficulties when demobilisation begins (para. 55).II. The Continuance of Military Conscription.63. The continued calling up of new age groups and of younger mendereserved in industry is recommended so that men with long war service can bereleased (paras. 56-57).III. The Continuance of Compulsory Civilian Service.64. (i) Under a two-stage ending of the war, disorganisation of war produc-tion would result from an immediate removal of all labour controls, but theirretention for any length of time after sufficient voluntary labour is available wouldbe impracticable.   The transition must be regulated and gradual (paras. 58-59).(ii) It will be necessary to retain for a time some of the additional membersof the Fire and Police Services pending the return of men now in the Forces andnew recruitment (para. 60).(iii) The remainder of the Civil Defence Services should be released as theneed for them disappears (para. 61).On behalf of the Committee,(Signed) W. A. JOWITT,Chairman.4 Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,16th November, 1943.Reservation by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of EconomicWarfare.I regret that I am unable to agree with the Committee&apos;s main conclusion,namely, that the principle of age and length of service should override, except ina comparatively few individual cases and possibly in the case of buildingoperatives, the immediate requirements of industry. Admittedly, it is mostdifficult to ignore the considered view of the War Office that any other method&apos; of demobilisation will cause grave discontent in the Army.    I understand,^^^^^ &quot; O d
however, that their view is largely based on their experience of 1918-19. It seemsto me that the soldier of to-day is likely to be far more apprehensive of post-warunemployment than his predecessor of a quarter of a century ago, and that hewould therefore be more disposed to accept the argument that certain classes mustbe released out of turn in order to provide jobs for those who come after, liven,however, if this surmise is ill-founded, the needs of industry are so urgent thatwe ought, in my opinion, to take the risk which the War Office foresees.2. It is unnecessary to emphasise the supreme importance of export tradeafter the war. The Report on the Recovery of Export Markets and the Promotionof Export Trade, submitted by the Secretary to the Department of Overseas Tradein April 1943 (R.P. (43) 25). makes it clear that much of the demand overseasfor consumer goods in the immediate post-war period will be transient and. ifthere be delay in taking advantage of it, the opportunity may be permanentlytost. To that extent the chance of extending employment in this country and ofearning overseas currency to pay for our necessary imports will disappear. Evenin relation to capital goods the Report stresses that early entry into the overseasmarkets is of the utmost importance: I would also call attention to the Reporton the Demobilisation and Resettlement of Labour (R.P. (42) 35, attached toW.P. (42) 498), which finds that the immediate post-war period &quot;will presentopportunities for winning a footing in new markets such as may not recur fora very long time, and we should be prepared to make the fullest use of them.&quot;Both reports, therefore, recommend that among the grounds justifying earlierrelease from the armed forces than would be permissible on the basis of age andlength of service should be production for export.3. It seems to me improbable that the programme of individual releasesenvisaged by this Committee will meet these requirements. The Board of Tradeis now engaged in a series of meetings with the representatives of the variousindustries. Until they have completed these meetings, which are likely to takeuntil February or March 1944, they can give no estimate of the number ofkey-men whose early release employers will be anxious to obtain. It may be,however, that the number of such men will greatly exceed 10,000. Moreover, theBoard of Trade state that they are unable in practice to draw a distinctionbetween production for export and production for the home market. If, therefore,export trade is to be restarted with the minimum of delay, steps will need to betaken to turn over a considerable part of British industry to peace-time productionas a matter of the greatest urgency.4. I would also draw attention to the evidence submitted by the Ministryof Fuel and Power. They emphasise the fact that a large number of men willprobably leave the mining industry as soon as they possibly can, and that theremav well be a heavy fall in the output per man. On the other hand, the demandsfor coal may substantially increase, especially if there is widespread destructionof coal-mines in Europe. But, apart altogether from the needs of liberatedterritories on a relief basis, it is clearly essential that we should recapture as soonas we possibly can our export markets for coal. The Germans have greatlydeveloped the Polish coal-mines, and it is estimated by the Ministry of EconomicWarfare that Polish production has increased from 36 million tons in 1937 toabout 50 million tons in 1942. It seems certain that any Polish Government willwish to make the most of this enlarged asset. If we are not in a position to meetthe needs of Northern Europe and Italy (not to mention other markets furtherafield) in the immediate post-armistice period, we may find that these marketsare lost to us, if not for ever, at any rate for a long period of years. This, indeed,is what happened from 1926 onwards, owing to the coal stoppage of that year,and our consequent temporary inability to meet our customers&apos; requirements.5. The Ministry of Fuel and Power estimate that there is a prospectivegap of up to 150.000&apos; miners, and the prospects of filling this gap are not at all .good. By far the biggest block of potential coal-mining labour after the war will jbe ex-miners now in the armed forces. These are estimated at a total of about50,000, of whom 40,500 are in the Army. Even if all these men are promptlyrecalled, it will still be necessary to find up to 100,000 men, with the addition of20,000 wastage for every year that the war lasts after 1943. If, however, the50^000 men in the forces are not promptly released, the problem becomes insoluble.It is quite clear that it cannot be met by the proposal for individual releasesapproved by this Committee.
6. The case made by the Board of Education is also a very strong one,though I do not suggest that it has quite the same urgency. Until&apos;a substantialnumber of male teachers are returned from the forces even previous educationalstandards cannot be restored, while any programme of educational advancementinvolving the increase of the school-leaving age is quite out of the question.I understand that during the forthcoming session it is proposed to introduce amajor. Education Bill. If the Board&apos;s case is turned down it will, I suggest,need to be made clear to Parliament that under the scheme of demobilisationnow contemplated there must be a considerable delay before the intended reformscan begin to operate.7. The facts regarding the Building Industry are fully set out inparagraph 31 of the Report. I would, however, like to emphasise that thereplacement Of houses destroyed in air raids is only a part of the programme.The stoppage of ordinary building throughout the war years has inevitablyresulted in a considerable deterioration of housing conditions even in thoseindustrial areas which have been free from enemy attack.8. I, therefore, feel that the principle of demobilisation based on age andlength of service should not be applied without very considerable modification.During the second stage of the war, it cannot, in any event, apply to thegreat majority of those now in the services. At best, the Service Departmentsdo not envisage more than a million releases during the first fifteen months, andthey have warned us that the number may be much smaller. On the other hand,the pressure to release builders, miners, and possibly other occupations will bevery considerable. In these circumstances I submit that, for some time afterthe end of the war, we should continue to apply the war-time principle that man-and woman-power must go where it can best serve.9. In order to emphasise that their special treatment is based solely on theimportance to the community of their individual services, the miners, buildersand other essential workers now in the forces should not, I suggest, be formallydemobilised. They should be seconded to industry from the forces, it being madeclear that they are still serving soldiers, sailors or airmen, and are liable at anymoment to recall. This form of temporary release would of course be conditionalon each man serving in industry where he is wanted. (I assume that the EssentialWorks Order will remain in force during the second stage of the war.) Therecan be no doubt that such a system would need a great deal of explaining, andwould not be easy to justify. But unless some system of occupational releases isadopted I cannot see how the pledge of food, homes and work is to be carried out.10. There is a general aspect of the question to which I attach no lessimportance. In my opinion, if we are to seize the opportunities both domesticand external which the end of the war will present to us indeed, if we are toavoid a cataclysmic decline both in our political influence and in our standardof living we shall have to make a collective effort comparable to that which we.have made in war. Such an effort will be possible only if the citizen becomesconscious of his direct personal interest in our collective prosperity; just as inwar he has become conscious of his direct personal interest in our common victory.But this idea is hardly likely to gain widespread acceptance if we begin with ademobilisation scheme of the kind now proposed, which proceeds on theassumption that measures which are highly desirable in the national interestcannot be adopted because the Forces would not understand or approve.DINGLE FOOT.18th November, 1943.[26440]d
APPENDIX I.Special Priorities Recommended by the Inter-Departmental Committeeon the Machinery of Demobilisation.(Appendix B to Final Report, p. 32-3 of W.P. (42) 498.)Class A.For early demobilisation, irrespective of age and length of service.(Not in order of preference.)(a) Individuals&apos; vitally required for reconstruction.(b) Members of Special Industry Groups and Occupational Classificationswhose immediate demobilisation is vital for national reconstruction.(c) Returned prisoners of war. including internees from neutral countries(unless Regulars or accepted volunteers for Interim Forces).(d) Extreme compassionate cases arising out of domestic or business hard-ship. *(e) Individuals whose immediate release is ordered by the Admiralty, WarOffice or Air Ministry.(/) Members of the Women&apos;s Forces who qualify on grounds of marriage.Class B.For demobilisation with appropriate age and service group, but to have prioritywithin the group.(In normal order of importance but order may be varied at discretionof CO.)(a) Pensioners mobilised under proclamation (R.N. and R.M. only).(b) Personnel serving on engagements entered into before the outbreak ofwar in any of the Regular, Reserve or Auxiliary Forces, except theMilitia, the Royal Naval Special Reserve and the Royal NavalVolunteer Special Reserve, who are not included in certain non-demobilisable classes.(c) Members of Industry Groups and Occupational Classifications whoseearly demobilisation within their groups is in the national interest.(d) Individuals who have a guarantee of employment.(e) Married men.APPENDIX IINote on the &quot;Points Scheme.&quot;(Proposed in the First Interim Report of the Conservative Sub-Committee onDemobilisation and Resettlement.)Under this Scheme demobilisation would proceed according to prioritiesdetermined by the score of points which each man received on some such basis asthe following : So many points for Service on or before certain dates.Service overseas.Steps of promotion.Age group.Marriage.Number of children.Employment immediately available.One-man business.Demand for personnel in trade or profession.Interruption of education.With a stibtraction of points for Desirability of the rnan&apos;s retention in the Services.
Several of the above factors, viz., service, age, marital state, employmentimmediately available, one-man business, demand for personnel in trade orprofession, enter in some form or other into the scheme proposed by the Inter-departmental Committee, but there is a world of difference between the way inwhich the Committee proposed to take account of such considerations in selectedcases and this proposal to assess the points value of each factor in the varyingcircumstances of every individual. Moreover, it will be seen from the foregoing-report that we regard the Interdepartmental Committee&apos;s scheme itself as opento objection in some of these respects and, in any event, as too complicated. Yetthe Points Scheme goes on to add the complication of five further factors. Thecase for and against the special recognition of &quot; service overseas &quot; is discussedin the report: &quot; steps of promotion &quot; we regard as a questionable ground forearly demobilisation; the &quot; number of children &quot; would be very difficult to keepup to date owing to births, deaths and children passing out of the qualifying agerange; &quot; interruption of education &quot; must obviously be worked in with theGovernment scheme for further education and the availability of accommodationin the universities, &amp;c.; while the vital element of military requirements, clearlycannot be entrusted to the uncertain play of a complicated formula, but must beparamount.The task of keeping records accurate and up to date, not only those at home,but still more those with the. units in the field, on this elaborate scheme would becolossal, but, even if it were achieved, the Army Authorities would have but thevaguest idea at any time as to the size of their demobilisation groups. If, inorder to overcome this difficulty, demobilisation were to proceed, as the reportunder examination seems to contemplate, by fixing from time to time a percentageto be discharged from each unit, there would be serious inequalities between units,a score of points that would qualify for discharge from one unit being quiteinsufficient in another. Such inequalities would add gravely to the discontentand suspicion inevitably arising from the complication of the whole scheme.-Finally, it would appear that all these nice adjustments are not to be appliedto the Women&apos;s Services, though some at least would seem to be as appropriateto women as to men. Instead, four groups are proposed, viz., married women withchildren, married women, women about to be married and others. It is notexplained how a woman&apos;s intention to marry is to be verified.APPENDIX III.Note on War-Time Procedure for Individual Releases from the Forces.Under the war-time procedure for individual releases the prospectiveemployer applies for the release of the person concerned to the Headquarters ofthe Government Department mainly interested in the employers work (e.g., theMinistry of Supply for a munition firm or the Ministry of Food for a grocer&apos;sshop). The employer states the nature of the work on which the firm is engaged,the capacity in which the individual whose release is sought would be employed,and the grounds on which it is considered essential to the firm&apos;s work that beshould be available.The interested Department may then decide on its own initiative that itcannot support the application and in that case it goes no further. But if theDepartment does desire to support it, the case is passed to a special Branch ofNational Service Department at the headquarters of the Ministry of Labour.This branch may, after consultation with the appropriate Labour Supply Branchand local enquiry, if necessary, recommend the appropriate Service Departmenteither to release the individual or to reject the application.The bulk of the applications are for release from the Army and there is,a standing arrangement for clearing cases by joint consultation with the WarOffice. In Air Force cases the application goes to the Air Ministry before theMinistry of Labour and National Service, and the operational aspect is clearedbefore the industrial aspect is considered. The final decision as to whether,having regard to Service needs, the individual can be spared, rests with theService Department.
