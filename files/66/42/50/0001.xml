He has also asked me to set out my viewsas to the reply which should be made to the State Department.2.   I suggest that this reply should be on the following lines(1) The United Kingdom Government greatly regret the delay in replyingto the communication of the United States Government with regard to theErojected approach by the President of the United States to Mr. de Valera. Onis return to England the Prime Minister at once discussed with his colleagues,the draft which had been given to him at Hyde Park. Before any conclusioncould be reached the second draft was received from the United StatesAmbassador and the matter has since been under careful consideration.(2) It was noted that the second draft differed materially from the earlierversion. The earlier draft constituted a public indictment of the Eire Govern-ment&apos;s policy and a demand that they should sever their relations with the Axisand provide naval and air facilities for the United Nations. The second draftwas limited to a confidential suggestion that the Eire Government should assistthe United States by the offer oi base facilities, which, however, might not berequired.(3) While the United Kingdom Government are most sensible of the friendlymotives which have inspired the United States Government in proposing thisapproach, they feel bound to put before them certain serious difficulties whichhave emerged as the result of their further examination of the proposal.(4) They feel that the United States Government should know the historyof past efforts which have been made by the United Kingdom Government sincethe outbreak of the present war to induce Eire to abandon her neutrality. Thefirst occasion was in June 1940, when British fortunes in the war were at theirlowest ebb. At that time the British Cabinet sent Mr. Malcolm MacDonald toDublin to discuss the question of Eire&apos;s entry into the war. His instructionsincluded the possibility of exploring, as a quid fro quo, some form of unionbetween Eire and Northern Ireland. All that Mr. Malcolm MacDonald obtainedfrom Mr. de Valera in reply was that he could only contemplate a united Irelandon the basis of Ireland as a whole being neutral in the war.(5) It might well have been expected that Mr. de Valera&apos;s views would havechanged with the progress of the war and as the fortunes of the United Nationsimproved. But when in December 1941, at the time of the entry of the UnitedStates into the war, Lord Cranborne, the Secretary of State for the Dominions,was sent to Dublin to make a. further attempt to bring Eire into the war, hereceived a similar reply. Mr. de Valera made it clear that he could not contem-plate abandoning neutrality until his claim to Northern Ireland had been satisfied.And even then he would give no undertaking.(6) All the information in the possession of the United Kingdom Govern-ment goes to show that Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude remains unaltered at the presenttime. He has within recent weeks made it clear in private statements that hestrongly disapproves of the action of neutrals, such as Portugal, in givingfacilities to the United Nations now that the tide of war is flowing in their favour..[26361-1]
(7) In these circumstances it appears almost certain that Mr. de Valera&apos;sreaction to the proposed United States approach, whichever form it takes, wouldbe unsatisfactory, but that, as before, he would avoid a direct negative and wouldseek to cloud the issue by reiterating his grievances in regard to partition.(8) Any reopening of the issue of partition in this form at the present timewould, however, be extremely embarrassing to the United Kingdom Government,in view of the very strong views which are widely held on th-is question both inGreat Britain and Northern Ireland. It seems possible, moreover, that it would,become equally embarrassing to the United States Government, since it would, ifit became known, be used by anti-British Irish elements in the United States tocreate prejudice against Great Britain and cause friction between the twocountries.&apos; (9) For these reasons the United Kingdom Government feel that any formalapproach to Mr. de Valera by the United States Government on the lines proposed,so far from clearing the air, might well give rise to acute difficulties for bothcountries. If there were an immediate need for naval and air facilities inSouthern Ireland, these difficulties might have to be faced, but the UnitedKingdom Government gather from the second draft of the proposed communica-tion that the United States Government do not at present take this view. Theywould suggest, therefore, that it&apos;would be wiser for the United States Governmentto postpone for the present the approach to Mr. de Valera which they have had inmind.., - (Signed) CEANBORNE.Dominions Office, 3rd November, 1943..
