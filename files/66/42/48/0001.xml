(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETW.P.   (A3) A962nd NOVEMBER,  1 9A3JAR CABINETLONDON AIREIELB POA TRAuTSPORT SERVICESNote by the Minister of Health1. In viev/ of the references in the memo ran dura &quot;by theSecretary of State for Air (A.P.(A3) AS2) to certain aspectsof this scheme which affect the Ministry of Health, mycolleagues may like to have some notes from me on the mattere2. The suggested scheme is to he carried out in threestages.      The first stage involves the demolition of ahout130 houses.      In viev: of the conditions in this locality,where housing accommodation is already overtaxed, it wouldhe essential that alternative accommodation should he &quot;builtfor the dispossessed persons.      The hullding of new housesdoes not present an insuperable problem, but there areobvious difficulties in provision of this kind at a timewhen Local Authorities, on account of the shortage of labourand materials, have been required to stop house building inspite of the pressing demands for houses from all sectionsof the population, and when they have great difficulty insecuring an adequate amount of labour for carrying outessential repair work on houses.      As it would be necessarythat the alternative accommodation should be availablebefore the existing houses are demolished, the provision ofthe new houses would have to. be put. in hand jjnmediately0 :3* Although the land on which the sludge disposal worksare situated does not fall within the area required forstage 1, for the reasons given in the Secretary of State5smemorandum, the finding of an alternative site andconstruction of new works v/ould need to be put in handimmediately.      It is possible that the Middlesex CountyCouncil will need to look outside the County for land whichfulfils the necessary technical requirements0      It isimportant that the County Council should be put in aposition at the earliest possible date to search for a newsite.      When such site has been found, the next step wouldbe to consider the most expeditious way of acquiring it0It may be that requisition by the Government would befound appropriate,.      It has to be borne in mind also thatsome houses on the new site for the sludge disposal worksmay need to be demolished and alternative accommodationprovidedoI do not desire to add to what is said in theSecretary of State&apos;s Memorandum about the replacement of

the sludge disposal works except that, in existingcircumstances, the work, which is rather specialised 5 isalmost certain to take longer to complete than the existingdisposal works (2 years) and will;, of course^ he much moreexpensiveoh. Should the scheme be approved in principle it will henecessary for me to be in a position without delay toapproach the Middlesex County Council about the SludgeDisposal Y/orks, and the other local Authorities concerned,about rehousingo5o The second stage involves the demolition of a further58 houses0      Similar considerations arise as in the caseof the first stage*6* The third stage, which is presumably a post-waroperation, would involve the demolition of a further 1 ,373houseso      I do not desire to offer any observations on thisexcept to point out that there will be an intense demand forhousing accommodation in the years immediately following thewar, and any scheme which involves the destruction of anysubstantial amount of existing housing accommodation is sureto be the subject of serious public criticism0E, BoMinistry of Health,    S,W.1,2ND NOVEMBER,  19h3o
