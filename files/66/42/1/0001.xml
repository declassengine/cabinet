Treasury,Whitehall, S oW. 1,I corne now to&apos; the point which I understand is uppermostin&apos; many hon. Gentlemen&apos;s minds.      It is whether the presentsystem of control exercised by my Ministry is adequate forthe purpose for which it was intended - &quot;the full operationalcontrol of the mines&quot; in wartime.     There has always beensome criticism of what is called &quot;dual control&quot;, by whichis meant, in short, the responsibility of managements onthe one hand to their Boards of Directors and on the otherto the Regional Controller.Hon. Gentlemen will agree that control has secured verysubstantial advantages,  advantages which could not have beenwon. without it.     In every district there has been created anorganisation to maintain constant and close contact with theleaders of both sides of the industry; a machine for carryingout the policies of mechanisation and concentration;    andlast, but by no means least important, an essential linkwith the Pit Production Committees.Let me remind the House what the position, was when thisorganisation was set up.    At that time there was a seriousa decline in production and a considerable increase in consura-ption, indeed it was oatinatod that.consumption would exceedproduction by 14,,000,,000 tons.     So far, howovor, were vcfrom ending the coal year last April with a deficit of thatorder that production actually exceeded consumption.Up to that point at least there was no possible groundfor suggesting that the re-organisation had failed.     Sincethen, however, production has fallen off.      Up to the 30thJune the decline, though apparent, could not reasonably beattributed to deficiencies in the ,/hito Paper Scheme and,as  the House is aware, steps were taken in co-operation withmy Rt. Hon. Friend the Minister of Labour,  to meet theTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT        -The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.

situation as it developed.      In the months which havefollowed the decline has continued and has boon of a moreserious nature.     What arc the causes?     Many hon, Momberswill bo able to form an estimate of the multiplicity ofreasons which are every day suggested to mo*     The question atissue, now,  however,  is how far the decline is attributableto-&quot;dual control&quot;.-I am well aware of the difficulties which are inherentin the syst^in of dual control and I should inform the Housethat I havo approached my colleagues on this question and, asa resn.lt, am now c ons idoping with theitr^gho question ofimprovements that may be necessary in the wartime machineryfor the operational control of the industry, in the light ofexperience, if the original intention of Parliament is tobe achieved-It is of the utmost importance, however, that hon.Members should realise that now proposals affecting thepresent structure of the industry will have to be consideredin relation to any long-term implications.      Discussions onthe subject of the future of the coalmining industry since Ibecame a Member of this House have proved that it is notentirely a non-controversial issue.      Our present job is to&apos;achieve better production and we cannot allow that purposeto obscured by controversy whose effect might be to divertattention in the coal fields from th,.- getting of coal to thepolitical problem.     In the^ consultntions which I am havingwith my colleagues on the best&quot; way of achieving the fullcontrol contemplated in the    hite Paper,  it is clear that wecannot lose sight of this aspect.Hon. Members will be well aware of the pledge containedin the White Paper on Goal that there can bo no question ofthe removal of control until Parliament has determined thefuture structure of the industry.      There is, therefore, noground to fear a repetition of the conditions which arosewhen control was removed after the last war.
