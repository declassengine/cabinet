THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET. / Copy No.W.P. (44) 370. /3rd July, 1944. ^WAR CABINET.FUTURE WORLD ORGANISATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Cabinet have already had copies of the various Memoranda on FutureWorld Organisation destined for communication to the United States and soviet governments together with a covering Memorandum giving the necessarybackground (P.M.M. (44) 4).*2. These drafts were considered at the recent meeting with the DominionsPrime Ministers, and as a result of the discussions which then took place Icirculate herewith revised versions of Memoranda A and B in which the alterations and amendments are shown in heavy type (Memoranda C, D and Eremain unaltered). These amendments and alterations were subsequentlydiscussed with the representatives of the Dominions at the official level, and thereis every reason to suppose that they would be acceptable to the dominions governments.3. The two suggestions in regard to which the latter, in varying degrees,expressed strong opposition were : (a) The idea of any unitary representation of the British Commonwealth; and(b) The constitution of regional political bodies.4. At the same time the Dominion Prime Ministers recognised that europe was to some extent a special case and they would probably not dissent from thecreation of some machinery for dealing with the affairs of Europe, provided thatthe overriding authority of a World Organisation in regard to the settlement ofpolitical disputes was explicitly recognised.5. The new paragraph 18 of Memorandum A accordingly brings to the forefront the scheme which I originally put forward to the Russian and theAmerican Ambassadors in July 1943 for a &quot; United Nations Commission for europe&quot; (see W.P. (43) 217). This scheme was generally approved by theDominions. I feel strongly that we ought not in present circumstances to go anyfurther in the direction of encouraging specifically European organisations, sinceto do so might, apart from other dangers (a) Give the Russians the impression that we were trying to organise Europeagainst them.(b) Tend to encourage isolationism in the United States.6. The present position is that we are under an obligation at some stage tocommunicate Memoranda A-E (or something like them) to the United States and soviet Governments. Mr. Hull now seems to think that we might exchange paperswith the Americans some three weeks before the opening of the proposed discussions. It is still not certain when these discussions will be held, since theRussians have not as yet replied to Mr. Hull&apos;s invitation to fix a date; but thereis reason to suppose that they will soon accept and that the conference may be summoned towards the end of July.1 Mr. Hull, at any rate, is pressing for ameeting as soon as possible.* N.B. We have since agreed, at Mr. HaH&apos;s urgent request, that the Chinese Governmentshould also take part in the discussions.[27761] b
7. I therefore ask my colleagues to approve Memoranda A-E in theirpresent form for communication to the Governments concerned at the appropriate moment, after they have been finally cleared with the Dominions. It is desirablethat the Cabinet should approve the attached Memoranda at an early date, for we may be called upon to circulate them in the near future.8. It will be seen that in regard to a number of points the memoranda setout alternative solutions. In order that the Delegation to Washington may be properly instructed, it would be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government todecide where their preference lies in each case. I suggest that the Cabinet shouldcall upon the A.P.W. Committee to consider all these points and make recom-mendations to it. I would then circulate to that Committee a paper formulatingthe questions to which answers are required.9. Finally. I should emphasise that the forthcoming discussions atWashington are purely exploratory.   They cannot commit Governments.A. E.Foreign Office, 3rd July, 1944.
secret memorandum A.SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE PERMANENT ORGANISATION.I. The Principles and Objects of the Organisation.I. The World Organisation will consist of independent States freelyassociated and working together for the better realisation of the common goodof mankind.2. The principles and objects of the Organisation should be stated in the preamble of the document which brings it into existence. The organisation should be as simple and flexible as possible. Thus the statement of its principles and objects becomes specially important, since they lay down the conditions inwhich action is taken by the members of the Organisation.3. Article 4 of the Moscow Declaration lays down that the organisation shall be based on the &quot;sovereign equality&quot; of States. Two principles follow from these words. In the first place members must agree to respect each other&apos;political independence, and secondly all members enjoy equality of status, though not necessarily equality of function.4. Members should not be entitled to receive the benefits of the Organisationunless they are prepared to accept the obligations that go with them. Moreover,it is the assumption of such obligations by all members that ensures to all thebenefits of the Organisation. This should be recognised, therefore, as one of theprinciples of the Organisation.5. The object of the Organisation is stated in Article 4 to be the &quot; main-tenance of international peace and security,&quot; and this must be regarded as itsprimary purpose.6. But if recourse to violence is ruled out, means must be provided by which members of the Organisation can settle their disputes by other than violentmethods; and the establishment of machinery for achieving this must be one ofthe objects of the Organisation.7. Moreover, in order that international peace and security shall bemaintained there must be in the world - some means by which States meet together to review and harmonise their political action. One of the objects of theOrganisation, therefore, must be to create a meeting place where statesmen can come together for that purpose.8. But international peace and security must be made positively, and notonly kept by the negative means of suppressing violence. They will be confirmedand strengthened by guarding the right of man to seek his freedom, and byincrease in the well-being of human society. Statesmen of the United nations have declared this to be both the purpose and the condition of development in international order.9. It will be necessary, therefore, for the Organisation to create institutionsto promote the betterment of world-wide economic conditions and the removalof social wrongs, and to. support and extend institutions which now exist for these purposes.10. Thus the principles and objects of the Organisation, and consequently the conditions in which its members receive its benefits and accept its obligations and on which actions taken under its authority are based, may be described asfollows:  II. Principles.ii) That all members of the Organisation undertake to respect each other&apos;political independence.(ii) That all members are equal in status though not necessarily in function.(iii) That all members undertake to fulfil towards each other the obligations which are the conditions of receiving the benefits of the Organisation.[27761] b 2
12.   Objects.(i) To ensure that peace and security shall be maintained so that men shallnot live in fear of war.(ii) To provide means by which all disputes arising between States may beso dealt with that peace and security are not endangered,(lii) To provide a centre in which the political action of States can be reviewed and harmonised, and directed towards a common end.(iv) To promote the betterment of world-wide economic conditions and thewell-being of all men by international agreement so that the fear ofwant may be removed from the world.(v) To guard and enlarge the freedom of man by institutions for theremoval of social wrongs.II. The Nature of the Organisation.13. In Article 4 of the Moscow Declaration it is laid down that theorganisation is to be founded on the sovereign equality of its members. its members will, therefore, retain control of their own actions except so far as theyare limited by the obligations into which they freely enter and by internationallaw.14. Nothing has been more clearly proved during the present war thanthe interconnexion of peace and security in all parts of the world. The future organisation must recognise this fact and be a world organisation in which allpeaceful -States in every part of the world can co-operate together for their mutual benefit.15. Though the status of all members is equal and all will enjoy the same rights and undertake the corresponding obligations, their differences in powermake necessary some recognition of differences in function. The initiatiYefor the formation of the organisation has come from the Four Powers, the UnitedStates, the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom and China, and it is generally recognised that its success will depend more upon their continued co-operationthan on any other single factor. The machinery of the organisation should makeit possible for them to carry out tke responsibilities which they will have agreedto undertake. They must be given, therefore, a special position in the organisation in order effectively to maintain peace and security. In general, as regards all states, the more power and responsibility can be made to correspond, the more likely is it that the machinery will be able to fulfil its functions,16. We look forward to the liberation of France and her restoration tothe ranks of the Great Powers.17. It is presumed that there will come into existence a number of specialised technical organisations through which States will combine together for various purposes. There are already such organisations in existence as partof the system of the League of Nations. The relations of these bodies to one another and to the main organisation ai&apos;e considered in Memorandum D. Here it need only be said that such bodies are unlikely to survive as effective instruments ina world from which reasonable security is absent.18. Just as there are special functional organisations, so there may beregional associations for various purposes when there is obvious advantage to beobtained by limitation of the sphere of action. In particular there should be some regional organisation for the Continent of Europe if only to prevent a repetition of the circumstances which have caused two World Wars to originatein that area. The condition of Europe at the close of this war will demand thespecial care and assistance of the three Great Powers and means must be foundto prevent its becoming the centre of a third world tragedy. It is possible thatout of some &quot;United Nations Commission for Europe,&quot; as proposed in para-graphs 9 and 10 of Mr. Eden&apos;s memorandum of the 1st July, 1943 (annexed),there might grow a European organisation which, under the guidance of the three major allies, might foster peaceful tendencies, heal the wounds of Europe, and atthe same time prevent Germany from again dominating the Continent. Suchregional associations might also come into existence for economic co-operation,for the promotion of welfare in colonial territories, &amp;c. It is, however, essentialthat they should not conflict with the world-wide organisation but rather assistit to carry out its purposes.
III. Constitution of the Organisation.19. It is generally recognised that it will be necessary to set up two mainbodies, one as a centre of discussion on which all States are represented and theother, a smaller body, as a centre of action. It is suggested that these bodies be termed the World Assembly and the World Council respectively.20. Membership. It is assumed that at the outset all the United nations will be invited to be members of the Organisation. What States now neutral shallbe admitted and at what period is a matter for consideration. The enemy Statescannot be admitted until they have shown by their conduct that they accept the objects of the organisation and intend to pursue them.21. All the members of the organisation should share in some manner in the admission of new members. It will have to be considered how far it is necessaryto lay down conditions under which a State shall cease to be a member of theOrganisation.22. World Assembly.  The sovereign equality of all members should berecognised by their representatives meeting together on a footing of equality in a world x-Vssembly at least once a year. The right of information and criticismshould belong to all members of the organisation.23. It is not suggested that this body should have all the powers that werepossessed by the Assembly of the League. The specialised and technical bodiesshould undertake some of the duties which that body performed and the initiative in preventing breaches of the peace should lie with the World Council.24. It is a matter for consideration whether the World Assembly shouldhave the control over finance and the admission of new members which theAssembly of the League possessed; but it is suggested that the States cannot beexpected to contribute to the finances of an organisation without some share intheir determination, nor to belong to a society to which other States may beadmitted without consultation with them.25. World Council. This body should be sufficiently small and compact toensure action and of such a character as to possess the confidence of all membersof the organisation.26. The constitution of this body raises many difficult problems. the relation between the Great Powers and other States has been a matter of disputefor over a century. It is clearly necessary that the Four Powers, which betweenthem are directly responsible for the peace and security of nearly two-thirds ofthe worfcTs inhabitants, should always be represented on it. The principle hasbeen generally accepted that where the interests of any State are specially affectedit should have the right to lay its case before the Council.27. It is desirable that the World Council should be strictly limited in size,and it has been suggested in some quarters that its membership should be restricted to the three or four Powers upon whom the responsibility for maintaining peaceprincipally depends. It is, however, open to question whether the other states would agree to the establishment of a Council so limited in number. In any casethe number and method of their representation is a matter for grave consideration and the manner in which the decisions of the Council shall be made may dependon the method adopted. The object would be to ensure that the other States onthe World Council command general confidence. Some form of election isprobably essential and the World Assembly might be used for this purpose.28. In such a Council some means must be found to ensure that the variousregions of the World are adequately represented. The size and area of Statesvary so greatly and are so unevenly distributed over the Continents that some agreement on this subject is essential. Thus, the Caribbean area has moreindependent States than all the rest of Latin America, which includes Brazil,Argentina and Chile. Both Europe and South America have many more Statesthan North America or Asia. Hitherto States as different in power and status as Canada and Panama have had equal rights of representation. The principlesof rotation has deprived the Council of experienced statesmen, while the creationof &quot;semi-permanent&quot; seats was much resented by some of the States that didnot enjoy the privilege.
29.   If the principle which governs the election of the Governing Body ofthe I.L.O. could be accepted, a more satisfactory result might be obtained, but&apos; it is difficult to find the principle to apply to a political body.30. Should Regional Associations of sufficient importance be formed (e.gM a regional organisation for Europe) they might furnish a basis for representation on the Council. But for the most part States do not recognise other States as&apos;&apos; representing &apos;&apos; them on institutions in which they have a major interest.31. It is clear that this subject will need careful examination not onlyamongst the Four Powers themselves but with the other States whose wishes mustbe taken into account.32. The main function of the World Council will be to ensure such inter-course between the statesmen of the countries represented on it as to enable themto secure solutions of international problems by discussion and co-operativeaction. For this purpose regular meetings with an appropriate procedure andsecretariat are indispensable. No other single factor is likely to be so influentialin producing harmony between the policies of States. The experience of the lastthirty years shows that there is no adequate substitute for it.33. The functions suggested for the World Council as the body responsiblefor the peace of the world are described in Memorandum B.34. It will also be necessary for the World Council to give some commondirection to the functional bodies.  This question is considered in Memorandum D.35. In general it is hoped that the Council may become a centre whereGovernments reconcile their attitudes towards major international problems so asto be able to act decisively towards a common end.36. Permanent Court of International Justice. It is assumed that therewill be general agreement that a Permanent Court of International Justice willbe set up.. The proposals of the Informal Inter-Allied Committee which recently reported&quot; on this question seem to indicate the general lines that should befollowed.37. Secretariat. A permanent secretariat will be indispensable. Theexperience of the League of Nations and the I.L.O. should be utilised. It is assumed, however, that a number of new specialised technical bodies will comeinto existence. Further consideration of this question might, therefore, awaitmore definite information concerning them.38. The suggestion that the head of the Secretariat should be given theright of bringing before the World Council any matter which in his opinionthreatens the peace of the world might well be incorporated in the rules of theOrganisation.39. Specialised and Technical Organisations. This question is considered in Memorandum D. The position of the International Labour Organisation will need special consideration.40. Seat of the Organisation. This problem should be left open until further information is available on the number and character of the functionalorganisations.41. Name of the Organisation. The term &quot;United Nations&quot; is now ingeneral use and there does not seem to be any strong reason to substitute any other for it.
SECRET.Memorandum B.THE PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES, THE QUESTION of guarantees AND THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH action should BE TAKEN FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF peace and SECURITY.I. Introduction.IF war is to be prevented there must be in existence a means to make those decisions which in the past have been made by violence. If an organisation isset up to achieve this end there must be some guarantee that its members will be protected should States, inside or outside it, threaten to subject them to violence.For the purpose of providing protection, action may have to be taken against anoffending State, and this necessitates some statement of how and when suchaction shall be taken.2. The maintenance of peace and security is not merely an end in itself buta means by which an ordered and progressive community of States may come into existence. The principles and objects of such a society have been indicated inPart I of Memorandum A, and it is on them that all action by the organisation should be based. A state of peace should be regarded as not simply the accept-ance of the status quo but active co-operation between States for the objects and principles of the Organisation.3. Such ends cannot be obtained by any system of procedure however skil-fully designed. Everything depends on the unity of purpose of those states which possess the greatest means of carrying out their purposes. It is impossibleto ensure that these States will always be in agreement, and no set of rules will do so. But an agreement to act under certain specific principles in a world organisation will make their co-operation easier and will enable other States tobe associated with them for their common purpose.4. If all the Great Powers are members of the Organisation and show their intention of acting in accordance with it, all States will be more ready to acceptthe responsibilities commensurate with their power. The absence of the UnitedStates and, for a long period, of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics fromthe League of Nations caused the United Kingdom to review its responsibilities.For the same reason smaller States were often reluctant to accept full responsi-bility.5. For the same reason also there was great anxiety on the part of manyStates to.define very closely the occasion for action by the organs and membersof the League of Nations. As is explained below, this attempt failed in its pur-pose. Moreover, public opinion did not understand the elaborate safeguards against arbitrary action that existed. It is suggested that the methods embodied in the constitution of the Organisation should be simple and flexible. They shouldbe extended and elaborated only as the result of experience.6. It is believed also that, whatever procedure be adopted, it is only by setting up some definite security system such as is suggested in Memorandum Cthat reality will be given to the promises made and that the States of the worldwill come to believe that by accepting the rights and responsibilities given tothem by the Organisation they will be spared such sufferings as they are nowenduring.II. The Pacific Settlement of Disputes.7. Disputes between States are divided into two main categories, those,often termed &quot; justiciable,&quot; that can be settled by a legal tribunal, and those inwhich other considerations are predominant.
8. It is the second class which produces the most intractable and dangerousdisputes, including those in which the legal position is entirely clear. In thepast, States have promised not to attempt settlement of their disputes by violentmeans, but they have not promised to settle their disputes. It is suggested thatit might be well if they now promised to &quot; settle&quot; their disputes in the sense that they will not allow them to endanger peace and security.9. Justiciable Disptites. It would seem that there is likely to be generalagreement that justiciable disputes should be generally settled by a PermanentCourt of International Justice. The Informal Inter-Allied Committee suggestedin its recent report that the Court be open to all States, whether they acceptcompulsory jurisdiction or not. It would be possible for the international organisation to make the acceptance of such an obligation a condition of member-ship, but in such a case it would be necessary to allow States to make certainreservations.10. The difference between accepting compulsory jurisdiction with reserva-tions and retaining full freedom of action is likely to have more psychologicalthan practical effect, especially if the World Council can obtain AdvisoryOpinions from the Court on some point in a dispute, which has been submittedto it.11. Other Disputes-Heievence to the World Council is the obvious methodof dealing with other disputes. Though other elaborate methods of conciliationhave been set up they have hardly ever been used and they have the disadvantage of placing the case in the hands of persons who are not responsible for the conse-quences of failure to preserve peace. It is only in the World Council itself thata body of rules and a technique of procedure can be gradually established as theresult of accumulated experience.12. It should be for the World Council to decide what method should beused for dealing with the dispute. Any decision of this nature should be regardedas a decision of procedure and consequently be adopted by a majority vote.13. Even on questions of principle (as opposed to questions of procedure)decisions might be taken by (say) a two-thirds majority of the Council rather thanby unanimity. In all such cases all the Four Powers should of course be includedin the majority. In any event, the*votes of the parties to the dispute should notbe taken into account.14. States are not likely to bind themselves to accept the decision of theCouncil in all cases. Nor would it be likely that they would undertake theobligation to enforce it on other States in all cases. But it would still be the function of the World Council, and particularly of the Great Powers on it, tosee that disputes did not threaten peace and security and for the other states to co-operate with it to the utmost of their power for that purpose, so that therewould still be large opportunities for action to deal with even the most difficultdisputes.15. For, as has been indicated, if peace and security are to be maintained,some method must be devised for the settlement of all disputes between States.&quot; Settlement &quot; in this sense may, as is often the case in domestic disputes, showthat no remedy exists for a legitimate grievance. But if States promise to- &quot; settle &quot; their disputes in the sense defined in paragraph 8 above, the balance is thrown more in the direction of change. The staUis quo is sufficiently safe-guarded by the mere existence of a universal system for the maintenance of peace and security. Should the dispute be such as to threaten peace and security, itwill be for the World Council (and in such cases action will depend largely&apos;onthe Great Powers) to decide what action should be taken to deal with it.16. If the dispute involves the Great Powers themselves&apos;the machinery for decision may prove inadequate; but there is hope that the habit of co-operativeleadership in the settlement of other disputes and the restraints imposed by theirown promises to one another and to other States may suffice to achieve a settle-ment, even where the machinery seems to be inadequate to do so. Much will depend on whether a sufficient number of States, great and small, come to attachso much importance to the preservation of the system that they are prepared to run risks and make sacrifices to support and preserve it.17. There was considerable agreement in the period between the two warsthat the vague words of Article XIX of the Covenant of the League of Nationswere hardly a sufficient recognition of the fact that there must be a change in
the world. When, in the thirties, it was perceived that there was no greatdesire in some countries to go to war to defend some of the frontiers erected bythe Peace Treaties, there was much discussion of a process which became knownas &quot;Peaceful Change.&quot; Examination of this concept shows that it cannot beobtained by a clause in a Covenant, but can only be a continual process achieved through discussion and compromise between the Great Powers and. in their dueplace, the smaller States concerned. But it is essential that such a process be guided by principle and subject to an ordered procedure, and it is necessary,therefore, that it should take place within an international organisation.18. It may be hoped that the international functional organisations whichare being brought into existence will contribute to furthering the process of peaceful change in an orderly manner.III. The Question of Guarantees.19. In considering this question the history of the guarantees given in theCovenant of the League of Nations must be taken into account, since it throwsgreat light on the nature of the problem. For by Article X the Members of theLeague &quot;undertook to respect and preserve as against external aggression theterritorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members.&quot; Theformula had first been devised by President Wilson for the Western Hemisphereand it was at his instance that it was applied universally. No method was laiddown as to how the obligation should be carried out except that the council should &quot; advise &quot; upon that question.20. Territorial Integrity. There was much opposition to the proposedArticle, attention being concentrated on the question of &quot; territorial integrity.&quot;Lord Cecil suggested that the guarantee should be withdrawn if the state concerned refused to accept a modification of frontier desired by a large majority of the members of the League of Nations. The vague phraseology ofArticle XIX of the Covenant was all that resulted from this proposal.Mr. Lansing and Dr. Miller were also opposed to inserting Article X, though thelatter came to believe that it made little difference. Sir Robert Borden tried to abolish it before the Covenant was signed, and the Canadian Delegation renewedthe attempt at the First Assembly. In 1923 an interpretative resolution wasadopted by the Assembly (though as Persia dissented it had no legal force) whichlaid down that it was for each State to decide how it should carry out its obliga-tions under this head, while the Council was to take into account, in any advice that it might give, the geographical situation and special conditions of each State.21. In fact, Article X was hardly ever used in the disputes which came before the League of Nations. But it was constantly referred to when some Statewished to remind others that its existing frontiers were guaranteed by them. Itwas also constantly used by critics of the League of Nations to show that its members had guaranteed for all time frontiers which they possessed no legalmeans of changing without the consent of the State concerned.22. Much smaller attention has been paid to this subject in recent discussions, though there may, of course, be a shift of interest when the treatiesthat register any changes of frontier which may be made come into existence.There is, however, reason to think that many States will be more interested in theestablishment of some concrete security system ready for immediate action thanin guarantees of frontiers which in themselves do little to prevent the invasionand occupation of territory by the armed forces of another State.23. Many other States would be likely to refuse to accept an organisation which committed them to a guarantee of the territorial integrity of all States.24. It is suggested, therefore, that no such guarantee be included in theobligations undertaken by members of the Organisation.25. Political Independence. The question of &quot;political independence&quot;raises issues of a rather different character. The Moscow Declaration hasalready based the Organisation on the &quot; sovereign equality &quot; of all States, whichimplies that the Members of the Organisation will retain legal control over theirown actions except in so far as they agree by treaty to limit it. All Statesnaturally attach the highest value to their political independence, and theprincipal statesmen have made repeated declarations that they intend to respect the independence of other States.[27761] .   c
26. But an undertaking to respect the political independence of other Statesdoes not necessarily involve a commitment to guarantee it. It is, moreover, not easy to define exactlv what political independence is. One State may control the actions of another State by indirect means. It is impossible to distinguish theline which divides such actions from what is generally regarded as the legitimateinfluence which one State may exercise on the actions of another. The objectionto any guarantee of &quot;political independence,&quot; therefore, is that it could onlyextend to external and legal forms. It could not take into account more indirectmethods.27. For this reason the inclusion of a guarantee of political independence in the obligations of the Organisation seems undesirable. But it should berecognised that mutual respect for the political independence of its members is oneof the essential principles of the Organisation as already pointed out in Part I of memorandum A.28. The Maintenance of International Peace and Security.: By theCovenant of the League, States undertook to inflict sanctions on another state which broke its promises to submit a dispute to pacific settlement and resorted towar. It was for each State to determine its own actions after the Council (orAssembly) had declared that the occasion for action had arisen. Doubt wasconstantly expressed as to the sufficiency of this promise, though, so far as wordscan guarantee action, a definite promise was made. But the duty of enforcingaction to be taken was laid on the members.29. Also by Article XI of the Covenant the duty of safeguarding the &quot; peace of nations &quot; was laid on the League, but no specific obligations as regards theaction to. be taken were laid on the Members.30. The Four Powers have already, by Article 4 of the Moscow Declaration,laid down that the main purpose of the international organisation is the &apos;&apos; main-tenance of international peace and security,&quot; and have asserted by Article 5 that&apos;&apos; they will consult with one another and, as occasion requires, with other membersof the United Nations, with a view to joint action on behalf of the community ofnations &quot; for this purpose until a system of general security is inaugurated. Itwould seem that it is along these lines that any guarantee should be given.31. The duty of co-operating to the utmost of their power in the maintenanceof international peace and security should be undertaken by all members of theOrganisation. The degree of such co-operation must obviously depend on the geographical situation of States, the amount of their resources, their own internal situation and possibly other factors which cannot be accurately weighed inadvance. But the duty of co-operating to the utmost of their power in an organisation which is essential to the peace and security of all should be laid upon all members.32. The duty of maintaining international peace and security should be laid in the first instance on the World Council acting on behalf of the other membersof the Organisation. It will be for the World Council to take the initiative togive effect to the undertaking to maintain international peace and security. Thehead of the Secretariat should, however, as suggested in paragraph 38 of memorandum A, be given the right to bring before the Council any matter which in his opinion threatened international peace and security.33. It is for consideration whether any special obligations for the main-tenance of international peace and security should be.explicitly assumed withinthe permanent Organisation by the Four Powers who have undertaken such a responsibility pending the establishment of a general system.34. If regional organisations are set up for security purposes, part of theresponsibility in the first instance might fall on them, but,&apos; as is suggested in memorandum A, paragraph 18, not in such a manner as to conflict with the finalresponsibility of the World Council for the maintenance of peace and security.IV. The Conditions in which Action should be taken for the Maintenanceof Peace and Security.35. It is generally recognised that there must be some statement in theconstitution of the Organisation as to the conditions in which action is taken tomaintain international peace and security. In the Covenant of the League ofNations and in the attempts to elaborate the Covenant great attention was givento this question.
36. In the Covenant the sanctions of Article XVI came into force only ifthere was resort to war after a Member had broken the promises made in articles XII-XIV. Even then each State necessarily determined for itselfwhether the casus fcederis had arisen.37. In Article X the guarantees were against &quot; external aggression &quot; only.It was by this article that the unfortunate word &quot; aggression &quot; was introduced into the Covenant and became the subject of so many debates at Geneva. But themore the word was discussed the more difficult it became to define exactly what it meant. The definition of aggression was considered important because it was thought that it might affect the right of the Council to advise that sanctions beemployed. The most notable contribution to the debate was the suggestion thataggression should be determined by the acceptance or refusal of arbitration or some other peaceful method of settling disputes. But this did not cover the preparations for aggression., nor did it take the time element sufficiently intoaccount. Moreover, the discussion and analysis of aggression enabled States touse a procedure calculated to defeat the objects of the Covenant. Illustration ofthis fact was given by the Japanese attack on China in Manchuria.38. In Article XI sanctions were not mentioned, and the obligations of theCouncil were stated in the most general terms. These obligations could be interpreted as giving the right to take drastic action, but in the light of other articles it was difficult to find in them any right to use force against a State. in actual practice a number of dangerous situations that arose between small states were dealt with successfully under Article XI, and a technique which involvedsuch matters as the setting up of commissions of enquiry and the establishmentof neutral zones was gradually developed.39. In the Protocol of 1924 an attempt was made to make the sanctions&quot; automatic &quot; by setting up an elaborate set of rules. But the discussions showed that such a course was impossible. Sanctions depend upon the will of Govern-ments and peoples and cannot be automatically brought into existence.40. As has been noted above, one test of aggression is the acceptance orrefusal of some method of settling the dispute. But the acceptance may be merelya method of delay while preparations for aggression are being made (as in thecase of Italy&apos;s attack on Abyssinia) or actual force is used (as in Japan&apos;s attackon China). It can be argued that in both these cases the lack of effective action was due not to any defect in the Articles of the Covenant but to the lack of will on thepart of the other States, and notably of the Great Powers involved, to go to warwith the recalcitrant State. But it was also true that Japan was able to use herright of veto under Article XI to place obstacles in the way of the necessaryenquiry, and that preventive action against Italy, before she attacked, was difficult to take legally under the Covenant. Under the Locarno Treaties the signatory States could act without League authority in the case of &quot;flagrantaggression,&quot; but not preventively. If the question of Germany&apos;s rearmament hadbeen brought before the Council it is not easy to see what sanctions could have,been taken against her under the Covenant.41. In actual fact there was never any doubt, in the cases in which theLeague ,of Nations was concerned, as to the identity of the aggressor, thoughsometimes as to the character of the provocation to aggression. States, it is true,adapted their actions and procedure to the language and resolutions adopted atGeneva and later to the Pact of Paris. But in no case were the real intentions and motives of the aggressive States concealed from the Governments of the othermembers of the League or from public opinion. The discussions at the Counciland the Assembly made them sufficiently clear. -42. This experience suggests that too. rigid a definition of the occasion for action is as likely to hinder as to facilitate the maintenance of peace and security.If the World Council is given power to act for this purpose it will be able towork out for itself the necessary procedure in the light of experience. It willbe easier also in such circumstances to refer matters to regional associations ifany such come into existence which can be used for that purpose.43. At the same time the principles and objects governing the actions ofMembers will have been laid down in the Preamble to the document bringing theOrganisation into existence. These, as suggested in Part I of Memorandum A,should include not only the maintenance of peace and security but also respect forthe &quot;sovereign equality&quot; and &quot;political independence&quot; of its Members. If,[27701] d
therefore, it is laid down that the World Council shall only take action inaccordance with these principles and objects, action for other purposes will be excluded. It is suggested that States will be protected from arbitrary action bythe World Council as much by this safeguard as by elaborate definition, while theWorld Council will be more free to act to protect States from violence.V. C on chisions.44.   As to the Pacific Settlement of Disputes (i) That all States should promise to settle their disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security are notendangered.(ii) That justiciable disputes should generally be decided by a PermanentCourt of International Justice,(iii) That other disputes should be subjected to a process of discussion and conciliation in the World Council, which should have power todetermine the procedure to be followed without the consent of theparties to the dispute.45.   As to Guarantees (i) That all Members should undertake to co-operate to the utmost of their power in the maintenance of international peace and security, andthat the World Council should be required to take the initi ative forthis purpose.(ii) That no guarantee should be given of the territorial integrity ofMembers.(iii) That no guarantee should be given of the political independence ofMembers, but that respect for it should be recognised as one of theprinciples of the organisation.46. As to the conditions in which action should be taken for the maintenanceof peace and security That there should be no attempt to lay down in advance any rigiddefinition of the occasions on *which such action should be taken, but that theMembers of the Organisation and the World Council should only beempowered to take action in accordance with the principles and objects ofthe Organisation.
ANNEX.Suggested Principles which would govern the Conclusion of hostilities with the European Members of the Axis.(1) The terms to be imposed on any European member of the Axis should be presented as one comprehensive document covering all the United Nations at warwith that member, and embodying the principle of unconditional surrender.(2) If there exists a central enemy Government with which we are preparedto treat, a fully accredited representative of that Government should be associatedwith its Commander-in-Chief for purposes of signature; or, alternatively, theArmistice should not come into force until confirmed by that Government.(3) If there is no such Government, the Armistice should be signed by theenemy Commander-in-Chief only. In that case, provisions which the enemyCommander-in-Chief lacks authority to execute would have to be omitted fromthe Armistice, which would thus be primarily a military document. Non-militaryprovisions should so far as necessary be embodied in a Declaration or Proclama-tion issued by the United Nations.(4) If there is neither an enemy Government nor Commander-in-Chief with whom we can or are prepared to treat, military resistance would presumably bebrought to an end by a series of local capitulations. It would, however, probablybe desirable that the United Nations should issue a Declaration stating their intentions in respect of the defeated Power. This would be followed by a seriesof Proclamations issued by the Allied Commander-in-Chief containing instruc-tions to the local authorities and population.(5) The administration of any Armistice should be placed in the hands ofan Inter-Allied Armistice Commission, the President to be alternately a repre-sentative of the United States, U.S.S.R. and the United Kingdom. TheCommission would establish its headquarters in the Axis country concerned, andwould be responsible for controlling the execution of the Armistice terms; in thefirst place, the disarmament and demobilisation of enemy armed forces, thecollection and disposal.of surrendered war material and other mobile property and the handing over of fortifications and other fixed property. Representativesof the Armistice Commission would be despatched to liberated Allied territory to perform a similar task in respect of the enemy troops there located and toregulate their evacuation or internment.(6) In the absence of an Armistice (see paragraph (4)), a Control commission should administer the appropriate portions of the Declaration.(7) Any Armistice or Declaration would presumably provide for occupation,whether total or partial, of the countries concerned. In the case of Germany the exact method of organising such an occupation should be the subject of technical discussions between the Military advisers of the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates and the U.S.S.R. in the first instance.(8) The United Nations Commander-in-Chief in any occupied country shouldhave complete responsibility for the maintenance of law and order.(9) There should be established a supervisory body entitled &apos;&apos; United nations commission for Europe,&quot; composed of high-ranking -political representatives ofthe United Kingdom, the United States and the U.S.S.R., of France and the minorEuropean Allies, and, if so desired, of any Dominion prepared to contribute tothe policing of Europe. The Commission should be situated at some convenientpoint on the Continent.The Commission would act as the supreme United Nations authority inEurope to direct and co-ordinate the activities of the several ArmisticeCommissions, the Allied Commanders-in-Chief and any United Nations civilianauthorities that may be established; and to deal with current problems, military,political and economic, connected with the maintenance of order.A &quot;Steering Committee,&quot; consisting of the representatives of the UnitedKingdom, the United States and the U.S.S.R. and of France, if she recovers hergreatness, should be established as the directing body of the Commission. Inthe &quot; Steering Committee &quot; the unanimity rule should apply.(10) It is likely that a number of civilian authorities will be set up by agree-ment between the United Nations, some on a world and others on a European basis.Apart from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration andthe Inter-Governmental  Committee which may emerge from the Bermuda
Conference, the establishment of a United Nations Shipping Authority and a united Nations Inland Transport Authority for Europe have been suggested.Analogous bodies may well be required to control telecommunications and propaganda, and to handle reparation and restitution and other economic problems. These authorities might, in respect of their European activities,establish.their headquarters in the same city as the. United Nations commission for Europe, to whom they would be responsible and provide the necessary technicaladvice.Foreign Office. 1st July, 1944.
