naval SITUATION.General Review.Adverse weather conditions have prevailed in the Channel and, with enemyminelaying in the assault area, have delayed the sailing and unloading of convoys.Enemy coastal forces have been active.Further attacks have been made on islands in the Volcano and Bonin groupsby U.S. carrier-borne aircraft.One U-boat has been sunk and two probably sunk.Home Waters. . *2. Unfavourable weather in the Channel, particularly on the 9th and 10th,caused damage to craft and tows. Northbound sailings of the shuttle service were cancelled on the 10th. but were resumed on the 11th. In the eastern area,after heavy minelaying by enemy aircraft on the 9th. traffic was suspended till the swell, which rendered the mines extremely sensitive, had decreased. Irregularshelling of the eastern beach has continued. The totals unloaded in the Britishand LT.S. sectors up to and including the 12th were : 1.178.227 men, 240,957vehicles and 929.694 tons.of stores.   The weather improved on the 12th.3. On the night of the 5th/6th H.M. ships Stevenstone (destroyer) andTrollope (frigate) engaged six E-boats off Havre. Trollope was torpedoed and badly damaged and was taken in tow. On the 7th four M.T.Bs. attacked a corvette and seven or eight E-boats : the corvette and one E-boat were sunk and another set on fire. H.M.S, Cattistock (destroyer) and the French destroyerLa Combattante and M.T.Bs. also engaged E-boats. One of the enemy was seton fire and the others were last seen attacking one of their own minesweepers.On the 8th M.T.Bs. sank one of four trawlers off the Dutch coast and damaged a second. M.T.B. 245 returned to harbour damaged and in tow. Early on the9th two M.T.Bs. engaged ten R-boats N.W of Havre : M.T.B. 434 was sunk,all the crew except one being rescued. On the 12th five E/R.boats attempting to pass westward through the Dover Strait were attacked by Coastal command aircraft, but no results were observed.4. Early on the 6th, H.M. M/S. Magic and Cato were sunk off Ouistrehamby human torpedoes, nine of which were sighted : two of them were sunk andtwo more possibly sunk, two prisoners being taken. Another attack was madeearly on the 8th, when 31 were sighted : seven of these craft were destroyed and seven more possibly destroyed, by ships and Spitfires; four prisoners including an officer were taken. The Polish cruiser Dragon, was torpedoed during this attack and was beached, but is considered a total loss. H.M. M/S. Pyladesand M.T.B. 463 were sunk.&quot;H.M.S. Rodney on the 7th shelled the area from which the human torpedoattacks were believed to have been launched. H.M.S. Roberts (monitor) and h.M.S. Belfast (cruiser) also bombarded enemy positions in support of the army&apos;attack on Caen.5. H.M. Canadian destroyers Qu&apos;Appelle, Restigouche, Saskatchewan andSkeena, on the 6th attacked four enemy trawlers escorting outward-bound U-boats off Brest, and sank three of them.During the night of the 7th/8th, H.M.S. Thomborough (frigate)&apos;and M.T.Bs.damaged two E-boats west of Cap d&apos;&quot;Antifer. On the following night H.M.S.Tartar and H.M.C.S. Huron (destroyers) engaged and damaged five trawlers offSt. Malo.  Accurate fire from shore batteries enabled the enemy to escape inshore.6. On the night of the 6th/7th F.D.T. 216 (fighter direction tender) was torpedoed off Cape Barfleur, probably by aircraft.During the week the following ships were damaged by mines in the assaultarea : M/S Pelorus, M/S Gorgon, Empire Halberd (L.S.I.), Empire Brutus (M.T.ship) and L.S.T. 359.7.   A 400-ton floating dock is in operation at Arromanches.Mediterranean,8. On the 8th, 5,639 tons were discharged at the port of Piombino, comparedwith the previous daily average of 4,000 tons.9. H.M. S/M Ultimatum on the 3rd probably sank an escort vessel offCannes, and H.M. S/M Unruly sank a ship in the /aegean on the 3rd andtorpedoed a northbound transport south of Kos on the 11th.
East Indies.10. ELM. submarines have reported as follows: Truculent, off Medan(Sumatra), on the 26th torpedoed and probably sank a strongly-escorted passengership of 4,000 tons, in addition to sinking a number of junks. Stratagem torpedoedan escorted cargo ship of 1,100 tons approaching Port Blair (Andamans) on the1st, and probably torpedoed a 2,000-ton escorted cargo ship off the Nicobars onthe 4th.Pacific.11. On the 3rd/4th carrier-borne aircraft made successful attacks on Chichiand Iwo, islands of the Bonin and Volcano groups respectively C500 miles S. ofYokohama). Three destroyers, two escort vessels, two tankers, two cargo ships and an ammunition ship were sunk, and one destroyer and several other ships sunk or damaged. In addition, 84 enemy aircraft were shot down, eight probably shot down, and 27 destroyed or damaged on the ground. There was also extensive damage to ground installations. The U.S. force lost 23 aircraft, but sustained no damage to ships.Allied destroyers on the 4th and 5th bombarded enemy concentrations onNoemfoor Island, west of Biak (Schouten Islands). Other Allied w-airships on the5th bombarded Manim Island (off Noemfoor) and cleared it of the enemy.On the 8th and 9th Guam Island (marinas) was attacked by light surface craft and carrier-borne aircraft. On the 9th Roea Island was attacked by aircraft with rockets and bombs.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Thirty-four attacks were made between the 1st and 12th, of wdiich 17were by shore-based aircraft, four by carrier-borne aircraft and 13 by worships.In addition to the three U-boats reported as sunk in last week&apos;s Resume a U-boat was sunk on the 8th by aircraft in the Bay of Biscay and 40 survivors rescued.On the 5th, H.M.C.S/ Ottawa (destroyer)&quot;with H.M.C.S. Kootenay (destroyer)and H.M.S. Statice (corvette) probably sank one south of Beachy Head. AnotherU-boat was probably sunk east of Durban by Catalinas from South Africa.Enemy Intelligence.13. Photographic reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 6th showed the prince Eugen, nurnberg, and one Schlesien. class battleship. The Hipper w*as.seen off the port.14. The one man or human torpedo which has recently been used by theGermans in the assault area is similar to that used previously in theMediterranean. Two 21&quot; electric torpedoes are joined one above the other, theupper torpedo, on which the operator sits, being without a war head. The lowertorpedo is fired and has a range of 2,000 yards at 20 knots. The speed on the surface of the complete outfit is 2-1-3 knots and has an endurance of about10 hours; it can be easily assembled and launched from a beach. The training ofoperators appears to have been hasty and simple, and to have been carried out atKiel or its vicinity.U-boats.15. One U-boat is believed to have been operating in the Channel against shipping in the assault area, with one or two on passage up Channel.The U-boat sunk off South Africa was probably one of two very large boatswhich recently entered the Indian Ocean.It is estimated that there are three U-boats in the Caribbean Sea-Enemy Attack on Shipping.16.   During the week a U.S. tanker was sunk by U-boat in the Caribbean.On the night of the 11th/12th a convoy from the United States was unsuecess-fully attacked by some 30 enemy aircraft off Oran.17.   Shipping losses by enemy action during June amounted to 16 ships of50,260 tons.   Marine casualties for the month raised the total of losses from allcauses to 72,084 tons.   U-boats sank seven ships of 27,118 tons, four of them in[27823] b
the Atlantic and three in the Indian Ocean. Three ships of 10,310 tons were sunk by mine in the Channel and one (2,037 tons) in the Mediterranean. surface craft&quot; sank three ships (1,812 tons) in the Channel and one (1,764 tons) was sunk by aircraft. Losses off the Normandy coast from the 6th to the 30th June were8 ships of 21,105 tons. In addition 21 ships (99,823 tons) were damaged, themajority of which can be repaired.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 9th, 588 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 164 were in ocean convoys and424 in British coastal convoys.Two escort carriers, 31 destroyers (including 11 U.S. destroyers) and 69 sloops,cutters, frigates and corvettes, were employed on escort duties. One homeboundconvoy consisting of 31 ships, and three outward-bound convoys consisting of133 ships, reached their destinations without loss.19. During June a total of 5.733 ships in 348 convoys reached their destina-tions without loss. This includes 1,383 ships in 132 Western Atlantic and caribbean convoys, 399 ships in 50 Indian Ocean convoys, and 3,316 ships in122 convoys bound to or from the United Kingdom and United Kingdom coastal convoys.Allied Minelaying.20.   No minelaying by surface craft was reported during the week.Aircraft laid mines in the Kattegat, off the Frisian Islands, and off the biscay ports.Mines were laid in the Malacca Straits, off Hong Kong and in the CantonRiver.. -Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.21. Minelaying by enemy aircraft continued off the assault beaches and sometimes well out in the approaches. About 50 aircraft laid mines on the night of the 7th/8th, and 100 and 75 on the twro following nights, with a further increase on the 10th/11th. Fifty-five ground mines were destroyed during theweek by sweepers and 28 were self-detonated. Since the 6th June 255 moored mines and 304 ground mines have been destroyed.During the night of the 4th/5th a strong force of E- and R-boats fromLe Havre attempted to operate in the assault area, some probably carrying mines :they were, however, driven off by our coastal forces.At Cherbourg most of the Grande Rade and approaches have now been cleared : port parties are clearing the docks and inner harbour. During the week75 moored mines have been swept in this area.There have been no reports of minelaying by aircraft in Home Waters.22. In the anchorage and approadhes to Anzio 16 ground mines and moored mines were destroyed.The mine totals are 5,054 ground and 5,269 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. Three of the larger ore-carrying ships have been reported during theweek entering and leaving -Bilbao.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.24. The Russians are now well beyond Salmi and hold almost all theterritory between Lakes Onega and Ladoga.Northern Sector.25. The Russians have opened a fresh offensive N.W. and W. ofNovo-Sokolniki, where they have advanced up to 22 miles on a 90-mile front.
Central- Sector.26. The Russians are driving on towards Dvinsk along the southern bankof the river Dvina, leaving the Germans in the Polotsk area at the head of aconstantly lengthening salient. S.W. of Dvinsk the Russians have already cut the road to Kovno, and at Vilna their troops have penetrated into the town and aremopping up the remnants of the German garrison. Lid a has been captured and russian troops are nearly 50 miles beyond Baranowicze The Russians are,therefore, advancing at an even speed along a front of 200 miles. Meanwhile theyhave now begun to move forward across the Pripet Marshes, where they havealready captured the railway junction of Luniniec.Southern Sector.27. The Russians have occupied Kowel, which the Germans claimed to haveevacuated with the object of shortening their front. The Germans now reportheavy Russian attacks in this area and maintain that these have been repulsed.They may be exaggerating the weight of the Russian attacks in order to be ableto announce a defensive success on a front where at present they have few enoughsuccesses to report.General.28. The Russians have not yet issued any comprehensive statement on the casulties suffered by the Germans in the last three weeks, but it is clear that thesemust have been very heavy. The Russians are still mopping up a German force which was left far behind the front line, in the Minsk area, and the fact that theyhave captured 19 generals suggests that many other groups of Germans must havebeen overrun.North-West France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.29. During the past week the First U.S. Army, in their offensive at the base of the Cherbourg Peninsula, advanced south from La Ffaye du Puits and astride the Carentan-Periers road, while further to the east it also made limited advancesN.W. and N.E. of St. Lo. On the Second British Army front, British and canadian troops captured the whole of that part of Caen which lies north and west of the River Orne, and in very heavy fighting to the S.W. of the town also made considerable progress towards the River Orne.U.S. Sector.30. The offensive by the First U.S. Army in the neck of the CherbourgPeninsula made slow but steady progress throughout the week in the face of stiffenemy resistance which only now shows signs of slackening. Very severe fightingtook place in the town of La Haye du Puits, which was finally captured on the 9th,and in the Foret de Mont Castre, a naturally strong defensive position ondominating high ground, which was cleared of the enemy on the 11th. A south-westerly thrust on the axis of the Carentan-Periers road made good progress andforward troops are reported to be within four miles of Periers.To the north of St. Lo a passage was forced across the River Vire and at . Jean de Daye was captured on the 7th. This bridgehead has been steadilyextended by some four miles to the west and to the south, where Pont Hebert was captured on the 10th. To the N.E. of St. Lo an attack which began on the 11thhas made some progress against strong opposition.British Sector.31. At the beginning of the week, while Canadian forces which had captured Carpiquet were engaged in a bitter struggle for possession of the stronglydefended airfields south of the town, a considerable number of reliefs andre-grouping of formations were effected within the 1st Corps prior to the attackon Caen. This took place on the 8th after a tremendous preliminary poundingby Bomber Command and the Allied Expeditionary Air Forces, by FI.M.ships and by massed artillery supporting the attack. Progress was rapid on theN.W. and N.E. flanks and, although the attack hung fire in the centre for sometime, the pincers from both flanks converged on the city, which was in our handsby 17.00 hours on the 9th.[27823] * 2
British and Canadian forces rapidly mopped up the remaining enemy resistance north and west of the River Orne, and the Canadians completed theircapture of Carpiquet airfield. On the 10th, a new attack was launched S.W. ofCaen towards the River Orne. The German reaction to this thrust was very strong but by the evening of the 11th British troops were firmly established onthe high ground north of Esquay. Their position included the important feature&quot; Hill 112&quot; which changed hands several times, but excluded the village ofMaltot which lies in a hollow and from which they withdrew in the face ofpersistent artillery and mortar fire. Meanwhile the Canadians had edged intoLouvigny but were compelled to withdraw again on the 11th. Heavy fighting-is still in progress in this area.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)32. Some of the most bitter fighting since the fall of Rome has been witnessedin Italy during the period, under review. The enemy has defended the approaches to Ancona, Arezzo and Leghorn with grim determination. His defence at timeshas shown signs of real aggressiveness, and numerous thrusts and counter-attacks have been repelled by our forces. In only one place have these enemy counter-attacks met with any success from his point of view; north of Umbertide our forces were compelled to withdraw some two miles.In the Adriatic sector Polish forces have been unable to make any ground inthe direction of Ancona but, together with Italian troops, they have managed to push north-westwards and westwards. Fillotrana was occupied on the 10th,and on the following day the River Musone was crossed and numerous villagercaptured farther to the west.In the area which lies N.E of Lake Trasimeno, Indian troops have madesatisfactory advances. Umbertide fell on the 6th, and our troops are now somenine miles north of this town. On the 9th Pietralunga was reached by recon-naissance-&quot;units, who were reinforced the next day. On the 12th, the enemyheavily counter-attacked the area and forced our troops to withdraw some twomiles.Fighting S.W. of Arezzo has been grim and determined; our positions havebeen maintained, but not improved. The enemy has counter-attacked repeatedly,but each attack has been driven off.French troops fighting south and S.W. of Poggibonsi improved their positionsslightly on the 7th when they captured Colle; since then no advances have beenreported. An indication of the fierceness of the fighting in this area is given bythe fact that one hill feature alone changed hands four times in one day.U.S. forces fighting between the French on their right and the Ligurian sea on their left were involved in hard fighting south of Volterra. On the 7th a freshdivision came into the line and rapidly pushed spearheads north to the east and west of the town. The enemy, realising that they were outflanked, withdrew,and U.S. troops entered Volterra on the 9th. Farther to the west, slight gainshave been made along the coastal area since Rosignano was finally cleared onthe 7th.Yugoslavia.33. The Partisans&apos; activity in Serbia has now spread to the area N.E. ofNis, where in a clash with Bulgarian forces on the 30th June, they killed 160and captured 174 Bulgarians.In the Sandjak the Partisans have successfully resisted German thrustsnear Bijelopolje (90 miles S.E. of Sarajevo).In Bosnia, two towns some 40 miles east of Banjaluka have been occupiedby the Partisans, who have also inflicted heavy losses on a German force attackingtowards Sanski Most (25 miles west of Banjaluka).Greece.34. Zervas has continued his offensive in the Epirus. On the 2nd, his troopsoccupied Arta barracks. On the 6th, a column of his troops advanced towardsPreveza, and after repelling strong German attacks withdrew *on thefollowing day.Intermittent fighting continues. In the course of recent fighting Zervashas killed 250 Germans, wounded 200 and captured 63.
Burma.&apos; (An outline map is included as an inset.)Chin Hills and Ghindwin.35. Fierce fighting has continued in the vicinity of Ukhrul, where a smallJapanese1&apos; force has been resisting in the northern outskirts of the village.Mopping-up continues.The enemy overlooking the Bishenpur-Silchar track have withdrawn fromthe area west of Bishenpur.Pacific Theatre.M arianas.36. Japanese resistance on Saipan ceased on the 8th. The remnants of theJapanese forces are rapidly being liquidated.Noemfoor Island.37. U.S. troops, who are in possession of the three airfields, are engagedin clearing the remainder of the island. They have occupied Manim Island,off Namber, without opposition.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. Though hampered by bad weather. Allied aircraft gave considerable support to our troops in Normandy. Strong formations of bombers attackedstrategic targets at Munich and Leipzig and oil installations in Germany, Austria,Italy and the Balkans.There was a considerable reduction in the number of flying-bonibs launched.United Kingdom.39. Flying-bomb attacks are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and home security &quot; ; no other important enemy air activity has been reported.Home Waters.40. During the week, aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,193 sortiesinvolving 10,149 flying hours.  Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 200 sea-mines.A convoy, consisting of ten ships each of about 2.500 tons, with nine escort vessels, was attacked, off the Frisian Islands, by Beaufighters; cannon-hits were obtained on most of the ships and one of them blew up after being hit by a torpedo, three others and a minesweeper were set on fire and five trawler-typeauxiliaries were left smoking; Flak was intense and two Beaufighters were shot down. The next day, Beaufighters attacked shipping in the same area; a largeexplosion on a 2,500-ton ship was observed, another heeled over, an escort vessel was destroyed and three others were last seen in flames. As a result of attacks by Mosquitoes off Brest, two minesweepers were set on fire and an explosion was seen on a Sperrbrecher.Typhoons made hits with R.P. on an 800-ton coaster off Lannion. Avengersset fire to an E-boat off Walcheren and hit a 1,000-ton patrol-type vessel off TheHook.Western Front.41. Poor weather continued to restrict operations. A total of 29,240 sortieswas flown and 27,355 tons of bombs were dropped. These totals show an increase over the previous week of 6,055 and 6,036 respectively. Allied losses were235 aircraft, of which 150 were heavy bombers, 17 medium and light bombers and 68. fighters and fighter-bombers. Enemy casualties in combat were212 destroyed, 14 probably destroyed and 90 damaged.By day, German fighter aircraft operated warily in back areas of theNormandy Front and offered no substantial opposition to the activities of our air forces no enemy aircraft opposed an attack by over 1,000 escorted heavy bombers, on the 8th, on targets in France. The G.A.F., however, reacted fiercelyto Allied operations over the Reich on the 7th, when some 350 fighters persistentlyattacked Allied formations that had bombed oil refineries and aircraft plants;these fighters accounted for 23 heavy bombers, although, in so doing, 77 of then.
were destroyed. On the other hand, heavy attacks on Munich on the 11th and12th met with no opposition except from Flak. At night, enemy offensive activityconsisted almost entirely of minelaying in the Beachhead area.France.42. Oh the evening of the 7th, heavy bombers dropped 2,275 tons of bombs on troops, armour and strong points around Caen. Similar targets in this area and around Carentan were attacked throughout the week and close support was provided over the battle-lines in other sectors, while extensive armedreconnaissances south of the Front resulted in the destruction of 168 M.T. vehicles,40 locomotives and 230 railway wagons and cars, many others being damaged; afurther 3,000 tons of bombs were dropped and about 3,260 E.P. were dischargedduring these missions. Other tactical objectives having a direct bearing on theland fighting included bridges (1,910 tons), railway junctions, tracks, embank-ments and tunnels (1,750 tons) and fuel dumps (760 tons). Thirteen airfields were bombed (650 tons). The results at Vaires marshalling yard are reported inAppendix VII, paragraph 7.A total of 9,935 tons of bombs was released during attacks on flying-bomblaunching sites and supply dumps. A target at St. Leu d&apos;Esserent (15 miles north of Paris), at which equipment arrived by rail and was sent on by road, is believed to have been the most active of the known main supply depots. It is known that,after an attack by Lancasters on the night 4th/5th (Resume 253), all approaches to the depot were blocked and a large section of earth over the limestone storage-caves had collapsed into them. Two companies of infantry and 500 workmen hadbeen directed to effect repairs. Photographs, taken after a second attack onthe night 7th/8th also by Lancasters, show that, again, all methods of approachwere blocked and considerable further subsidence had been caused. It is probablethat the reduction in the number of flying-bombs launched since the 6th is due tothese two operations.Germany.43. Two heavy attacks were made on Munich. In the first, 1,285 tons of bombs were dropped on the railway centre and 350 tons on aero-engine works andan airfield; 2,815 tons were dropped on the city in the second attack. seven aircraft factories and a ball-bearing plant at Leipzig were bombed (1,175 tons) vide Appendix VII, paragraph 19 and in an attack on the town centre at Kiel590 tons were released. Synthetic oil refineries at Lutzkendorf, Bohlen andMerseburg (total 465 tons) and airfields at Kolleda and Nordhausen (total 210 tons)were among other targets attacked Appendix VII, paragraphs 13, 18, 20, 21.All the foregoing operations were carried out in daylight. At night.Mosquitoes dropped 90 tons on Berlin and 85 tons at synthetic oil plants at Buerand Homberg (Appendix VII, paragraph 17).Mediterranean Front.44. During the week ended dawn on the 11th, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 10,882 sorties, of which 2,916 were heavy bombers, and dropped 8,384 tons of bombs; 96 Allied aircraft, including 57 heavy bombers,are missing and 159 enemy aircraft were destroyed.In Italy, close support was provided for Allied land forces, and enemy communications were heavily attacked. Oil installations in Italy, Yugoslavia,Germany, Austria and Rumania were attacked by heavy bombers.Italy.45. In the course of operations over Italy, heavy bombers flew 621 sorties jand other bombers, including fighter bombers, flew 2,700 sorties.North of the battle area, attacks were maintained on enemy communications and transport. Several hits were obtained on the railway bridge at Casarsa(35 miles N.E. of Treviso), and a 75-foot span was seen to have collapsed. As aresult of an attack by heavy bombers, a gap of 100 feet was made in the viaductat Avisio. Several railway bridges were destroyed and a number of others damaged. Railway centres were attacked at Verona (over 300 tons), Milan/Linate (146 tons) and in the areas of Milan and Genoa; considerable damage was done and many wagons de-railed. Over a wide area, numerous rail tracks were cut and hits obtained on roads.  During one operation fighter-bombers destroyed
7 locomotives, 42 units of rolling stock and. 28 M.T.; many other successfuloperations were made against similar targets. A total of 116 M.T. was destroyed and a further 38 damaged.Effective attacks were made on enemy headquarters, bivouac areas, fuel and ammunition dumps and gun positions. Several attacks were made on the harbour at Spezia; the quays at Marina di Pisa and barges and buildings atPorto Corsini (6 miles N.N.E. of Ravenna) were hit. In the Pola Channel a1,500-ton vessel was sunk. Beaufighters destroyed one schooner and probably sank a 13,000-ton vessel. Light bombers attacked three airfields. The steel works at Bergamo was attacked by 54 Fortresses; all major buildings were severely damaged and the works put out of production. In the area of Ancona, sixJu. 87s were shot down. About 10&apos;Ju. 88s bombed Perugia and targets in theeastern battle area.The oil storage depots at Trieste were bombed by 116 Fortresses and fivesmall cisterns were destroyed and others damaged; the liner Stockholm(28,000 tons) was seen to be on fire. The oil stores at Porto Marghera were attacked by 126 Fortresses and many hits observed.Soioth of France.46. Escorted Liberators bombed the harbour at Toulon (179 tons), - therailway centres at Nimes (433 tons) and Miramas (243 tons), a railway bridge overthe Var River (117 tons) and a bridge at Theoule-sur-Mer (36 tons). From these operations 13 bombers and one fighter are missing and 14 enemy aircraft were destroyed.   Beaufighters attacked railway targets at Valence and Narbonne.Germany and Austria.47. U.S. heavy bombers, based on Italy, attacked the Blechhammer synthetic oil plants (near Oppeln, 55 miles S.E. of Breslau); 811 tons of bombs were dropped. It is believed that the south plant was well covered, but an effectivesmoke-screen obscured the north plant. The synthetic oil and coking plants atOderthal (75 miles S.E. of Breslau) were also attacked, 197 tons being dropped.These operations took place simultaneously with a heavy attack on Leipzig fromBritish bases. Over these targets about 300 enemy aircraft were encountered,of which 51 were destroyed; 18 heavy bombers and three fighters are missing.In the Vienna area, a night attack, in which 73 tons were dropped, was madeon Feursbrunn airfield; ten Wellingtons and three heavy bombers were lost onthis operation. Four other airfields and three oil refineries in this area were attacked by 528 escorted heavy bombers and some good results were achieved;54 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of 17 bombers and three supportingfighters.The Balkans.48. A mixed force of bombers dropped 174 tons on Brod Bosanski oil refinery and 222 heavy bombers attacked the Xenia and Concordia oil refineriesat Ploesti. From this latter operation eight heavies are missing and 14 enemy fighters were destroyed. The railway centre at Zagreb was bombed by106 Liberators and 46 similar aircraft attacked an industrial plant at Dubnica.Beaufighters damaged 22 river craft in the Danube. Mostly in Yugoslavia,12 locomotives were destroyed and 17 damaged, 29 M.T. were destroyed and231 railway wagons damaged. A 5,000-ton vessel was severely damaged, and offthe coasts seven small craft were destroyed and eight others damaged. A numberof successful attacks was made on enemy troops and fuel dumps.Three attacks were made on Rhodes harbour by Venturas. In Crete a radarstation and Maleme airfield were bombed by Baltimores.Russia.49. During the present offensive,&apos; it is believed that powerful Russian airformations have operated ahead of their armour, to clear the way for the deeppenetrations of the armoured columns. Russian bombers have made a number.of night attacks on enemy raihvay centres; Brest-Litovsk was attacked on threeconsecutive nights.German long-range bombers have operated regularly during the week;numerous night attacks against rail targets having been carried out.
Burma.50.

Attacks on this country with flying-bombs have continued during theweek. On Saturday there was a lull of about fifteen hours, the longest period since these attacks commenced. London has remained the principal target, exceptfor two nights, when the Southampton/Portsmouth area was attacked; on thesenights only a few flying-bombs fell in London. A flying-bomb fell near Wattonin Norfolk and another at Combe near Newbury, probably the furthest pointsyet reached. The total number of flying-bombs launched during the week was699, of which 373 were destroyed, 82 of these being shot down over the sea.
Damage.57. Damage continues mostly to affect residential and business property,hospitals, and other buildings. Although a total of 55 key-points have been involved during the period, in four cases only have the effects been serious, andthe damage of national importance.The question of the loss of man-hours is now under survey. Damage todock property has again been fairly extensive, but no serious effects on shipping facilities have been reported. Railways have been involved in 15 incidents; ofthese, 6 resulted in interruption of services one was a railway key-point, acarriage and wagon works.Casualties.. 58.
