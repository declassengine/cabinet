The French services responsible for publicity will facilitate in every possible manner the task of the Allied Commander-in-Chief. They will be instructed to collaborate with him in regard to the issue of notices to thepopulation necessitated by the conduct of operations or by the security requirements of the Allied forces or of the population itself.AGREED MINUTE REGARDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF relief supplies FOR THE CIVIL POPULATION IN LIBERATEDMETROPOLITAN FRANCE.The French Delegation have requested that Memorandum No. I should. &apos;provide that: (a) The places where the French Administration take over supplies importedfor the civil population, and the arrangements for this purpose, shallbe determined by agreement between the Allied Commander-in-chief and the Delegate.(b) From the moment of taking over these supplies, the French Administra-tion shall be responsible for their distribution to the civil population.The British Delegation are able to state that they agree in principle that the detailed distribution of relief supplies in liberated Metropolitan France shouldbe handled by the French Administration. Detailed arrangements for thispurpose would, of course, be made after consultation between the allied commander-in-Chief and the Delegate. It is recognised, however, that military necessity may in certain circumstances require that relief supplies are distributeddirect to the civil population by the Allied military authorities.In view, however, of the fact that a large proportion of the civil relief supplies imported into France by the Allied Commander-in-Chief will come from sources other than British, the competent British authorities do not feel that itwould be appropriate to include the provisions by the French Delegation in memorandum No. I.
