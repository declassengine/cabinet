Social Insurance. It contains proposals approved by the Reconstruc-tion Committee wi,th regard to the provision to be made for industrial casualties.It is proposed to supersede the existing system of workmen&apos;s compensation,under which the employer is made liable for the payment of compensation for industrial injuries, and to substitute a system based generally on the acceptedprinciples of social insurance.

II.-THE PRESENT system. The present system of Workmen&apos;s Compensation was first established in1897; and was thus the pioneer system of social security in this country. Basedon the liability of the individual employer under legislation which, where neces-sary, is interpreted and enforced by the Courts, it stands in almost every respect in sharp contrast to the later schemes of social insurance. It was revolutionaryin the sense that it broke away from the principle that an employer could onlybe made liable to a workman for injury)&apos; due to his default or the default ofpersons in responsible positions under him, but it was nevertheless largelyFor nearly half a century the compensation of workmen for industrial injuryhas been a liability, imposed by law, upon their employer. Under the existing system, it has been open to the employer and, in some cases, obligatory for him to insure himself against this liability; while it has been for the workmanto make his claim and to take steps to enforce it, if challenged, in the Courts.Inevitably compensation has thus become a disputable issue between the two parties or their representatives. The result has naturally been a growth inlegal complexity and the emergence of certain unsatisfactory features; forexample, the extensive practice of paying, in. full discharge of liability for what may prove to be a continuing loss of earnings, a lump sum which the employer may offer for the sake of simplicity and finality, and the workmanmay accept for the same reason.Henceforward, the Government, as part of their extension and recasting ofthe social insurance system, propose that provision for injury or loss of life in industry shall become a social service administered as a separate scheme, but under the Minister of Social Insurance. Benefits at special rates will be paid from a separate insurance fund, to which the employer, workman and theExchequer will be contributors. This means a fundamental change in themethod of providing against what may be one of the most grievous forms of personal misfortune: it involves also a great simplification of what has become a very complicated and elaborate system.Under the present system, benefits are related to the estimated loss of earning capacity. Under the Governmenfs plan benefits will be paid at flat rates,with supplements for family responsibilities. In the earlier weeks of disability,there will be injury allowances at uniform rates. Afterwards, if disablementis prolonged, there will be industrial pensions based upon the extent to whichthe workman has suffered from the injury, by comparison with a normalhealthy person, regardless of whether and to what extent he has lost his earning capacity. The pension will not be affected whatever the workman may earnlater and (except in some cases of minor disability) will not be replaced by a lump sum payment. There will be pensions for widows, parents and certain other dependants of those who have died from industrial causes.This system is in many respects like that which is the basis of war pensions schemes. It thus recognises a certain similarity between the position of the soldier wounded in battle and that of the man injured in the course of hisproductive work for the community. Neither is liable to have his pensionreduced on account of what he may earn after the injury; each is compensatednot for loss of earning capacity but for whatever he has lost in health, strengthand the power to enjoy life.The new plan will avoid the main weaknesses and difficulties of the existing system. The Government believe that it will remove workmen&apos;s compensation from the atmosphere of controversy and conflict with which it has beensurrounded and will establish it for the future on a happier and sounder founda-tion. It is their intention, if the scheme commends itself to Parliament, tointroduce and pass the necessary legislation as soon as practicable with a viewto bringing it into operation at the same time as the general scheme of social insurance.

influenced by the Common Law idea of personal responsibility, as well as bythe prevailing views as to the limits of State interference.2. Before the Act of 1897 there was no legal right to compensation for an industrial injury except in the limited number of cases where, at common law or under enactments modifying.the Common Law, the employer could beheld liable on proof of negligence on his part to pay damages to the workman or his dependants. This liability was extended by the Employers&apos; Liability act of 1S80, which excluded the defence of common employment in cases of personal injury due to defective work, plant or machinery or to negligence on thepart of persons to whom the employer had delegated his responsibility. ThisAct proved ineffective, and between 1880 and 1897 various unsuccessful attempts,of which the most notable was Mr. Asquith&apos;s Employers&apos; Liability Bill of 1893,were made to enlarge still further the circumstances in which the employercould be held responsible on the basis of negligence. It was, however, impos-sible in this way to cover the great number of accidents for which no blamecould reasonably be attached to the employer or persons in responsible posi-tions under him, and it was eventually recognised that the proper line of pro-gress would be by way of an industrial compensation scheme under which compensation would be provided at the employees expense for all ordinaryinjuries sustained by workmen in the course of their employment. The Act of1897 proceeded- on these lines. It imposed a liability on the employer to pay compensation to a workman injured by accident arising out of and in thecourse of his employment, or to his dependants if the accident resulted indeath, whether or not there had been negligence on the part of the employeror anyone employed by him. Nor was negligence on the part of the injuredworkman himself a bar to the recovery of compensation.3. The Act placed no obligation on the employer to insure against thisliability it was left to his good sense to do so should the burden be likely toimpose too severe a strain on his financial resources. In the debates which preceded the passing of the Act it was suggested that the liability should beplaced on a trade insurance fund or funds instead of on the individual employer;but this suggestion was opposed on various grounds, the main criticism being that it would involve more State interference than this country would tolerate.4. The Act did not deprive the workman of his rights at Common Law orunder the Employers&apos; Liability Act for injuries caused through negligence, butit included provisions against the recovery of damages in addition to workmen&apos;compensation. It required the workman to choose between accepting thecompensation provided by the Act and the remedy at common law or underthe Employers&apos; Liability Act, but it provided that if a workman failed in an action against his employer for damages he could obtain from the Court an award of compensation.5. The Act v/as limited originally to certain dangerous employments, but in1906 it was extended to cover all persons working under a contract of service or apprenticeship, with a few exceptions, of which the most important was thenon-manual worker earning more than  250 (since raised to  420) a year.The Act of 1906 also provided for death or disablement caused by scheduledindustrial diseases.6. The amount of compensation was fixed, not on the Common Law principleof indemnity for injury due to the fault of another, but on the principle of a division of loss between the employer and the workman; it was related, subjectto maxima, to the average earnings of the workman and it took no account of his family responsibilities. The Act did not give compensation for an injury assuch or for the disability resulting therefrom but only for loss of earning capa-city; it did not make good the whole loss, but was intended to provide a sub-stantial measure of relief to the injured workman or his dependants.7. The Acts have been amended and enlarged from time to time and one ortwo-important modifications have been made in their basic principles, notablyby the introduction of compulsory insurance in the coal mining industry underthe Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Coalmines) Act, 1934,* and by the recent war-* 24 and 25 Geo. 5, C23.

time Acts,f which, by increasing the weekfy compensation by means of fiat ratet The Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Supplementary Allowances) Act 1940 (3 and 4 Geo. 6,C47) and the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Temporary Increases) Act, 1943 (6 and 7 Geo. 6,C49).allowances related to family responsibilities, have made a substantial breachin the principle of compensation based on loss of wage-earning capacity. Other-wise the main features of the system introduced in 1897 have remained un-altered.8. (i) The benefit under the Acts in cases of total incapacity was originally a weekly payment not exceeding 50 per cent, of the average weekly earnings ofthe workman in the employment in which he was engaged before the accident,subject to a maximum of  1 per week. The War Addition Acts of 1917 and1919* gave a temporary increase of 75 per cent, in the weekly benefit for total* 7 &amp; 8 Geo. 5, C42 and 9 &amp; 10 Geo 5, C83.incapacity, but these Acts were repealed by the Act of 1923.1 That Act raisedf The Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act 1923 (13 &amp; 14 Geo. 5, C42).the maximum from  1 to 30s. but the proportion of earnings was left at 50 percent., save that for workmen earning less than 50s. a week the proportion was fixed on a scale varying from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent.(ii) During the present war the weekly compensation has been increased bythe addition of flat rate allowances under the Acts mentioned in paragraph above. The effect of these allowances is to bring the maximum for total in-capacity in the case of the single man up to 35s. a week during the first thirteenweeks, and 40s. thereafter, and in the case of the married man up to 40s. duringthe first thirteen weeks, and 50s. thereafter. A man with children also gets an allowance of 5s. a week in respect of each child under 15 years of age, or up tothe 31st July next following the 16th birthday if still at school. The weeklypayment, including supplementary allowances other than children &apos;s allowances,may not, except for some workers earning less than 50s. weekly, exceed two-thirds of the pre-accident earnings, and, if children&apos;s allowances are payable,may not exceed seven-eights.(iii) In cases of partial incapacity the compensation is a proportion of thedifference between the pre-accident average weekly earnings and what the workman is earning or is able to earn in some suitable employment or businessafter the accident; and the supplementary allowances are payable in the pro-portion which the weekly payment for partial incapacity bears to the weeklypayment to which the workman would be entitled if totally disabled.9. Where the weekly payments have been continued for not less than sixmonths, the employer has the right, on application to the County Court (inScotland, the Sheriff Court), to have his liability redeemed by payment of a lump sum; and he may at any time agree with the workman to redeem it by a lump sum payment, subject to certain safeguards afforded by registration ofthe agreement in the Court.10. (i) In fatal cases, compensation takes the form of a lump sum the amountof which depends on (a) the workman&apos;s earnings, and (b) the members of his family who were dependent on him at the time of his death and the extent oftheir dependency. The maximum where only adult dependants are left is  400.Where the workman leaves children under the age of 15 in addition to an adultdependant, an additional sum is payable and the aggregate maximum is  700.(ii) The compensation in fatal cases is not paid direct to the dependants but must be paid into the Comvty Court (or in Scotland, the Sheriff Court) to bedealt with in such manner as the Court thinks best for their benefit.(iii) Where no dependants are left reasonable expenses of medical attendanceand burial are payable up to a maximum of  1$,11. It was originally contemplated that disputes would generally be settled by informal arbitration by a Committee representative of the employer andhis workmen, or by an arbitrator agreed on by the parties, or by the county court Judge (in Scotland, the Sheriff) a form of procedure which was described by the Attorney-General at the time as &quot; something in the nature of a domestic

III.-PROPOSALS IN THE REPORT ON SOCIAL insurance and ALLIED SERVICES14. Sir William Beveridge&apos;s Report * recognises that the existing system* Cmd. 6404. The main passages inthe Report dealing with workmen&apos;s compensationare paragraphs&apos;Nos. 77-105, 258-264, 289-291, 323, 331-336, 353, 360, 366, 393-395 and401 &quot;and Appendix A (Memorandum by the Government Actuary) paras. 30 and 36-46and Appendix E (Administrative Costs of Various Forms of Insurance).of workmen&apos;s compensation has conferred great benefits in the past. It has enabled the workman in the great majority of cases to get his compensationwithout any serious difficulty and without unreasonable delay; and, as theReport points out. there are other substantial advantages which may be claimed for it. On the other hand, the Report draws attention to a numberof serious disadvantages in the present system. It refers to the formal, con-tentious and costly method for settlement of disputes; the difficulties of the workman who is not assisted by a.trade union or approved society in prosecutinga claim; the possibility of improper pressure on him to reduce his claim orto take up work for which he is not fit; the want of complete security for pay-ment of compensation; the difficulties of demarcation between industrial and non-industrial cases; the unsatisfactory provision made by lump sum settle-ments; the high costs of administration over parts of the field; the inappropriate-priateness of the system in cases of industrial diseases which develop over along period or are of a recurrent nature; and the absence of any provision for medical and post-medical rehabilitation of the injured workman.15. The&apos; Report recommends that the existing system, which it considers&quot; was based on a wrong principle and has been dominated by a wrong outlook,&quot;should be superseded, and that provision for industrial disability should beforum which should settle matters in a cheap and expeditious manner.&quot;Except in the Cumberland and Durham coalfields, where representativecommittees have been set up, this intention has not been realised. Disputesare generally settled, subject to appeal on questions of law to the Court, ofAppeal (in Scotland, the Court of Session) and the House of Lords, by arbitration in the County Court; and this arbitration has developed into a regular legal proceeding.12. The employer has a right, when a workman first claims compensation and subsequently within prescribed limits, to have him examined by a doctorappointed and paid by the employer. Disputes on the question whether a workman is fit for employment and, if so, to what extent his incapacity is dueto the injury are settled either by a reference through the County Court to a medical Referee appointed by the Home Office, whose certificate is conclusive,or by arbitration.13. Throughout the period since the last war, the present system has been severely criticised on various grounds and the Government have set up, fromtime to time, departmental committees to report on the working of the Acts.The most important of these was the Holman Gregory Committee which reported in 1920, and recommended a number of far-reaching alterations, manyof which have not, however, been adopted. In December, 1938, a RoyalCommission was appointed to examine the law of workmen&apos;s compensation and the relation of the system to other statutory schemes for giving benefitsor assistance to incapacitated or unemployed workmen. It was also directed to advise, in relation to workmen&apos;s compensation, whether any alteration isdesirable in the present position in regard to the civil liability of the employer to pay compensation or damages in respect of injuries due to employment,independently of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts. The proceedings of theRoyal Commission were suspended in 1940 owing to the war. The commission had by then taken a large amount of evidence, but had made no Report. when sir William Beveridge was invited in 1941 to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into Social Insurance and Allied Services, workmen&apos;s compensation was expresslyincluded within the scope of that enquiry.

made as part of a unified scheme of social insurance of a contributory character the benefits being paid out of a central fund which would be maintained by contributions payable by the employers and workmen and the State, andwould be administered by a Ministry of Social Security.16. Dealing with the possibility of complete unification with the social insurance scheme the Report says that, &quot; if the matter&apos; were being con-sidered in a clear field, it might well be argued that the general principle ofa flat rate of compensation for interruption of earnings adopted for all other forms of interruption, should be applied also without reserve or qualificationto the results of industrial accident and disease, leaving those who felt the needfor greater security to provide by voluntary insurance an addition to the flat rate subsistence guaranteed by the State.&quot; As the Report observes, &quot; if a workman loses a leg in an accident, his needs are the same whether the accidentoccurred in a factory-or in the street; if he is killed, the needs of his widowand other dependants are the same, however the death occurred.&quot;17. Nevertheless, the Report recognises that, apart from historical reasons,there are strong grounds for making a&quot; distinction in the matter of benefitsbetween industrial and other forms of disability. These grounds are first, that&quot; many industries vital to the community are also specially dangerous and itis essential that men should enter them and desirable therefore that they shouldbe able to do so with the assurance of special provision against their risks . . .for themselves and their families &quot;; secondly, that &quot; a man disabled during thecourse of his employment has been disabled while working under orders &quot;;thirdly, that &quot; only if special provision is made for the results of industrialaccident and disease irrespective of negligence, would it appear possible ason grounds of equity and for the avoidance of controversy it is desirable to limit the employees liability at Common Law to the results of actions for whichhe is responsible morally and in fact, not simply by virtue of some principleof legal liability.&quot;18. The Report concludes that &quot; on balance the reasons for distinguishing between industrial accident &quot;and disease and other causes of injury, at leastwhere death occurs or disability is prolonged, outweigh the reasons on the other side in favour of complete uniformity.&quot; It accordingly proposes certain important departures in respect of benefits (see paragraph 21 below) from theprinciples of the general social insurance scheme.19. (i) On the question how the necessary funds should be obtained theReport accepts the principle of the pooling of risks, which it recognises is in accord with the general trend of public opinion. It refers to the evidence given by the Mineworkers&apos; Federation before the Royal Commission on Work-men^ Compensation in favour of the contributions being paid only by employers,but at a fixed flat rate applicable equally to all industries, but points out&quot; that the pooling, of a risk between industries makes it difficult or im-possible to maintain that the cost should be borne by employers only. Inso far as industries depend upon one another, both employers and employees in each industry depend upon all other industries. There is no reason why the employer of a bank clerk or of a domestic servant, rather than the clerk orthe domestic servant himself, should contribute to the cost of accidents inmines and in ships. In so far as there is community of interest between dif-ferent industries making it fair that all industries should share equally in providing for a risk which affects them unequally, this community of interestapplies to the employees as well as to the employers.&quot;(ii) Other arguments advanced in the Report against confining the cost tothe employer are: (a) &quot; If employers are to bear the whole cost it is hard to justify taking theadministration out of their hands; it is hard, therefore, to give to the responsible organisations of workman the chance of taking a part, notin litigation, but in co-operative treatment of industrial disability &quot;;(b) &quot;it is undesirable that while most forms of interruption of earnings are met by benefit to which the insured persons, with others, have contributedand out of a- fund in whose stability and economical administration theyare directly interested there should be one form of interruption for which

the funds are provided wholly by someone else. Such an arrangement will lead to constant pressure to push up the compensation for that particular misfortune, though it needs in reality no more than other formsof misfortune.&quot;20. (i) While accepting broadly the principle of pooling industrial disabilityrisks in the same way as health and unemployment risks, the Report claims that &quot; there is a good social reason for taking a different line, in part at least,about the dangers of industrial accident and disease. Though a high risk of accidents is inevitable in mining, shipping and some other industries, it doesnot follow that all accidents are inevitable; the number and severity of accidentscan be diminished or increased by greater or less care on the part of thosewho manage industry.&quot; The Report therefore proposes another importantdeparture from the principles of the security scheme; namely, that the fundsrequired for benefits in industrial cases should be derived (a) in part only as to about two-thirds from contributions by employers, workers and theState, in the same proportions as for health insurance (five-twelfths each from employers and workmen and one-sixth from the State), and (b) in part as toabout one-third from a special levy on employers engaged in industriesscheduled as hazardous, that is, as having.materially more than the normal riskof accident or disease in industry as a whole. The effect would be that thewhole liability in the non-hazardous industries and part of the liability in thehazardous industries would be pooled and the balance, amounting to two-thirds of the excess cost in the hazardous industries, would be met by the special levy on those industries.(ii) The Report proposes that there should be set up, at least in everyindustry scheduled as hazardous, a statutory association of employers and employees which, besides concerning itself with matters such as safety and measures fox re-habilitation and re-employment within the industry, wouldbe responsible for collecting from individual employers their quotas of thespecial levy required in the industry in accordance with a scheme to be pre-pared by the association and approved by the Minister. Although the asso-ciations would consist of representatives of both sides in the industry, it couldbe provided in matters that might be regarded as solely the concern of the employer &quot; that the decision should rest with the employer&apos;s side alone; this power would make it possible for the employers in each scheduled industry as a body, subject to approval by the Ministry of Social Security, to adoptwhatever system of levy, by individual merit rating or otherwise, they thoughtmost conducive to the prevention of accidents or disease and the consequent reduction of the levy.&quot;21. The scheme of benefits and the rates provisionally proposed in the report are set out below. The Report assumes that there will be a State scheme of family allowances applicable to all children in a famity except the first.(a) During the first thirteen weeks of incapacity for work the ordinarysecurity benefit would be payable, i.e. 24s. for a single adult man orwoman without dependants or a married man with gainfully occupiedwife, and 40s. for a married man whose wife is not gainfully occupied;there would be reduced rates for single persons under 21 years (20s. ifaged 18-20 and 15s. if aged 16-17 years). A child&apos;s allowance would be payable for the first child and, in the case of the single workman, a-dependant allowance of 16s. for one adult dependant living with him and not gainfully occupied.Following existing law, benefit would not be payable for the first three days of disablement unless the incapacity lasts for four weeks or more.(0) After the first thirteen weeks of incapacity for work, an industrial pension would be paid equivalent to two-thirds of full-time earnings, but not lessthan the security benefit as under (a), nor more than  3 weekly.(c) For persons partially disabled the pension would be proportionate to theloss of earning power.(d) Lump-sum payments for industrial disability would be restricted to cases in which the Security Office is satisfied on special grounds that suchpayment is in the workman&apos;s interest,

IV.-THE GOVERNMENTS VIEWS23. (i) The Government endorse generally the criticisms of the existing system made in the Report. In particular, they consider it to be too com-plicated and to allow too much scope for contention between the workman(or his trade union) and the employer (or the insurance company or mutualassociation which, in the great majority of cases, handles the claim on behalfof the employer) and it thus tends to prejudice good relations between the employer and his workmen. The cases in which actual legal proceedings are taken form only a small fraction of the total number, but even so they numbersome thousands annually, and in addition there are numerous cases in whichthe claim is settled only after considerable negotiation. Moreover, in the eventof a dispute the workman is apt to feel that he is placed on an unequal footing with the employer or his insurers, and to suspect that the opposition to his claim is not based on merits but is actuated by motives of financial interest.(ii) The Government consider it essential to provide that in future claimsshould be made on an independent authority and settled by a procedure lessliable to give rise to friction. This, however, involves a complete change of system. So long as the liability to pay compensation is the liability of the employer, it is difficult to justify taking the administration out of his hands, orto substitute for litigation less formal, contentious and costly methods for thesettlement of doubtful cases.(iii) The principle of placing the liability on the individual employer has hadother unfortunate consequences. For example, the employer generally pro-tects himself by insurance, and the premiums or levies are fixed according to the risks of the particular industry or class of employment, so that broadly speakingeach industry carries its own risks. The result is that the heaviest liabilityfalls on the hazardous employments, which include certain important industries such&apos; as mining and shipping, which have to face foreign competition. It is sometimes claimed that the imposition of the liability on the individual em-ployer conduces to safety by giving a direct financial incentive to employers toadopt greater precautions; but as pointed out later (paragraph 31 (ii)) it wouldnot appear that it has, in fact, made any material contribution in this direction.On the other hand, the principle of pooling risks recognises a community ofinterest between different industries. It is a principle which has found accep-tance in other fields, e.g. unemployment insurance, and will be widely extendedunder the new scheme of social insurance. The Government consider that itshould also be adopted for insurance against industrial accident and disease.(iv) The general conclusion reached by the Government is that the, time has come.when the present system should be replaced by a new scheme, thegeneral structure of which should be based on the accepted principles of social insurance.(v) The Government have considered the possibility of including cases of. (e) In fatal cases a single payment described as an industrial grant, theamount of which would be prescribed by Regulations, would be paidin respect of the widow and of other dependent persons. This grant would be in addition to funeral grant, widow&apos;s and guardian benefits, but these benefits would be taken into account in fixing the amount.(/) Entitlement to benefit would not be conditional upon contribution record,as under the general scheme of social insurance.22. The Report further proposes (a) that claims should be dealt with by administrative rather than legalprocedure, with a right of appeal to special local tribunals;(6) that medical treatment should be provided as part of the NationalMedical Service; and(c) that post-hospital rehabilitation should be provided as part of the general service to be organised for this purpose by the Ministry of Labour and national Service.

industrial accident or disease in the general scheme of social insurance on thesame terms as disability arising from other causes and superimposing on that scheme a liability on the individual employer to provide additional benefits inaccordance generally with the provisions of the existing system. Such anarrangement, however, by perpetuating the principle of the liability of theindividual employer for the purpose of the supplementary benefits, would retain the defects of the existing system. Moreover, the workman would haveto make his case concurrently to two separate authorities under widely differingprocedures. In the view of the Government it would be difficult, if not impossi-ble, to co-ordinate satisfactorily the two systems.24. (i) Proceeding on the basis that the new scheme should be founded on social insurance principles, the Government agree with the proposals in theReport that the new scheme should be comprehensive in scope^-that is, thatbroadly speaking it should apply to all persons working under a contract ofservice including non-manual workers without any income limit; that the cost should be borne by a central fund maintained by contributions from employersand workmen, with a contribution from the Exchequer; that claims should bedealt with by administrative rather than legal procedure; and that the responsi-bility for the general administration and supervision of the working of thescheme should rest on the authority responsible for the general scheme of social insurance.(ii) The Government recognise that there is a strong case for providing specialbenefits for industrial casualties, both on historical and on other grounds. Inthe industries where most of the industrial accidents occur workmen are exposed to far greater risks than citizens in the ordinary walks of life. In coal mining,for example, in every year one workman out of every six engaged in the industrymeets with an accident. The Government think it reasonable therefore tomake special provision for industrial casualties, both in disablement and in fatalcases. Further, they agree that benefits should not be conditional on paymentof a minimum number of contributions.(iii) The Government also concur in the recommendations that the practiceof commuting weekly payments for lump sums should cease, and that provisionfor medical treatment and post-hospital rehabilitation of industrial disabilitycases should be dealt with as part of the national schemes for these purposes.25. The Government, however, for the reasons given in the following&apos;para-graphs, are unable to accept certain of the main proposals of the Report. Someof these involve what appear to the Government to be unwarranted departures from the generally accepted principles of social insurance. Others would retainfeatures of the existing system which have proved unsatisfactory in practice and have given rise to much complaint, or would introduce fresh difficultieswhich it should be an aim of the new scheme to avoid. The proposals whichthe Government do not accept are (a) the limitation of special rates of benefit for industrial disability to casesof more than thirteen weeks duration;(b) the proposal to relate industrial pensions for long term disability to the earnings of the workman before the accident in cases of total incapacity,and to his earnings both before and after the accident in cases of partialincapacity;(c) the provision proposed for dependants in fatal cases, not by way ofpension, but by a single payment termed &quot; industrial grant &quot;; and(d) the imposition of a special levy upon employers in certain industries to bescheduled as hazardous.26. Limitation of special rates of benefit to long term cases.(i) The Government do not think it right to limit special provision for casesof industrial disability to cases where-disability continues beyond a specified period. As the Report points out, cases which last longer than thirteen weeksconstitute not more than 10 per cent, of the total. Moreover, the single work-man without dependants has, in fact, normally been receiving under existing legislation 35s. weekly during the first 13 weeks, and the Government think itwould be unreasonable, particularly under a contributory scheme, to requirehim to accept a lower rate such as that of 24s. mentioned in the Report.

(ii) One of the special advantages claimed in. the Report in support of partialunification with the social insurance scheme is that, under the arrangement for giving ordinary disability benefit for the first 13 weeks, there would as a rule be no need to decide whether the accident or disease arose out of and in thecourse of employment. There would, however, be a number of cases where, inview of the possibility that the workman would be disabled for more than13 weeks, it would be necessary to ascertain the cause at an early stage, and inany event, as the Report admits, it would be essential that the Social InsuranceAuthority should record and analyse all its experience. In the great majorityof cases, no dispute arises as to the origin of the injury, and the government think that the advantage claimed in the Report on this ground for unification of rates during an initial period can be exaggerated.27. The Government agree with the proposal that there should be an initial period during which a temporary allowance would be payable, but in their view this allowance ought to be at a higher rate than that proposed for non-industrialdisability. This allowance should be- replaced, if the disablement is likely tobe permanent or prolonged, by an industrial pension, but the Government donot favour an arrangement by which the date of transfer from temporary allowance to pension would be determined entirely without reference to thecondition of the workman or his prospects of recovery. Moreover, if a hard and fast line were drawn at the end of the thirteenth week for transferring casesfrom allowance to pension, it would be difficult to provide for the case mentionedbut not dealt with in the Report, of a workman who has partially recoveredbefore the end of that period and is fit for some employment. A more flexiblesystem is required under which a pension can be awarded at a date appropriate to the circumstances of the individual case.28. Relation of industrial pensions to earnings.(i) The proposal to relate pensions to earnings contravenes two principles towhich the Government attach importance, and which are otherwise adoptedgenerally in the Report: first, that there should be differentiation in benefitsaccording to family responsibilities; and secondly, that subject to provision forsuch responsibilities, there should be uniform flat rates of benefit in return for&apos;uniform flat rates of contribution. Further, the assessment of workmen&apos;compensation by reference to earnings has givn rise, as indicated below, to serious difficulties and objections.,(ii) The calculation of the average weekly earnings over a period beforethe accident has been repeatedly criticised on the ground that the earningsso determined do not necessarily represent the normal earning capacity of the workman; in times of full employment and overtime, as at present, they go beyond, and in times of trade depression they fall below, his normal earning capacity. It is urged that it is hard on a workman who meets with an accidentwhen his earnings are relatively low that he should be penalised by receivingcorrespondingly low compensation, and that the sense of hardship is accentuatedif he sees that another workman in the same employment, who has sufferedan injury similar to his own, but at a time of good trade, is receiving com-pensation at a higher rate.(iii) Alternative methods for calculating earnings have been put forward,the underlying idea being to base the compensation on a hypothetical figurerepresenting what the workman might be expected to earn under normal con-ditions. Such a procedure would, however, introduce a great element of guess-work, and would be likely to result in more frequent disputes. discussions with representatives of the employers and, workmen have not disclosed any satisfactory solution of this problem.(iv) Another possibility which has been examined is that of fixing compen-sation by reference not to actual earnings but to the standard rate of remunera-tion applicable to the employment. There are, however, many industries andemployments in which there is no standard rate; and in others the standard&quot;rate is not applicable to all classes of workmen employed in the industry, orvaries in different districts, and the Government are advised that such a method would give rise to even greater difficulties than the present system.(v) Further, the assessment of the weekly payment in cases of partial

incapacity on the basis of a proportion of the difference between the pre-accident earnings of the workman and what he is earning or is able to earnin some suitable employment or business after the.accident has given rise to much dispute and has often had most unfortunate results. In many casesthe workman has felt that the work offered to him was not suitable for his capacity or would otherwise be prejudicial to his complete recovery, or he hasfelt aggrieved because, though his compensation has been reduced, no work ofthe kind for which he is fitted has, in fact, been available. Or again, he hasbeen reluctant to resume his old employment or undertake new employmentfrom fear that his compensation would be reduced and that, if he failed tomake good owing to his disability, he would find it difficult, if not impossible,to get his compensation restored to its previous level. In such cases the psycho-logical effect is to delay the recovery of the workman.(vi) Similar considerations have sometimes operated to make the workmanreluctant to submit to any rehabilitation treatment, and the Delevingne * and* Inter-Departmental Committee on the Rehabilitation of Persons Injured by Accidents,1939-Tomlinson Committees f on Rehabilitation have both commented on thet Inter-Departmental Committee on the Rehabilitation and Resettlement of disabled persons, 1943 (Cmd. 6415).possible adverse effects on workmen who have only partially recovered, ofa system under which the provision of light work may be regarded chieflyas a means of reducing the compensation. The former Committee recom-mended (p ge 57 of their Report) &quot; that an injured workman&apos;s capacity for light work which can be reached at a certain stage of his treatment should beregarded not from the point of view of compensation and as a reason for reduction of the compensation, but solely as a means by which the completerestoration of his working capacity can be furthered.&quot; The Tomlinson Com-mittee (paragraph 44 of their Report) while accepting the view that light work as an aid to restoration may, in some cases and subject to certain conditions,more suitably be given in industry than in a special centre, strongly deprecated&quot; a system under which the provision of light employment is treated not aspart of the rehabilitation process but merely as a factor in determining thequantum of compensation.&quot;(vii) Another grievance has been that, whenever there is an increase in wage rates resulting in increased earnings, the weekly payments of compen-sation to partially disabled workmen are reduced under the method prescribed in the Acts by half the amount of the increase, so that the workman does not get the full benefit of the addition. An attempt was made in the Workmen&apos;compensation Act, 1943, to mitigate this complaint by providing that, whenevera change takes place in the rates of remuneration in the class of employmentin which an injured workman was previously employed, his average weekly earnings can be recalculated, at the instance of either the employer or the workman, on the basis of what his earnings would have been had the changedrates been in operation over the relevant period before the injury. As a resultof this provision, which applies to total as well as to partial disablement cases,many disabled workmen have been able to get their weekly payments increased;and, so long as wages tend to increase, this provision benefits the workman.But in the event of a fall in wage levels, the compensation rates over a wide field would be subject to reduction, and the Government doubt whether any scheme which provides for fluctuations of benefit according to whether wagesrise or fall would in the long run be found to be satisfactory.29. (i) The principle of providing compensation based on loss of earning capacity, which the Report proposed to retain in all cases Of. more than thirteenweeks&apos; duration, is the cause of all the difficulties referred to in paragraph 28above and in the Governments view these difficulties are insuperable so longas this principle is retained. It necessitates in all such cases, whether of totalor of partial incapacity, the calculation of pre-accident earnings, and in casesof partial incapacity it necessitates also the calculation of post-accident earning capacity. This method of assessing compensation moreover must necessarily be accompanied by a system of review at any time of the weekly payment inorder to ascertain whether (a) incapacity still exists, and if so, to what extent,

and (b) whether the loss of earning capacity is properly ascribable to the injury or to other causes.(ii) The Government have come to the conclusion that the only satisfactory solution is to abandon the principle of awarding compensation in respect of loss of earning capacity, and to adopt two completely new features for the assessment of industrial pensions.   These features are: (a) to provide, in accordance with the generally accepted principle of social insurance, uniform fiat rates of pension without regard to pre-accidentearnings, but taking account of family responsibilities; and(b) to give benefit according to the degree of disablement due to the injuryin the same way as is done under war pensions schemes, namely through an assessment by a Medical Board of the condition of the workmanresulting from the injury compared with, the condition of a normalhealthy person of the same age and sex.(iii) The new principle of giving compensation for the injury itself and not for loss of earning capacity is a cardinal feature of the Government proposals.It has the following advantages: (a) By getting rid of the distinction hitherto drawn between total andpartial incapacity for work, and giving the workman who has sufferedan injury causing permanent or prolonged disablement a pension cora-mensurate with the assessed degree of disablement, irrespective of hisearning capacity, it eliminates as a cause of dispute the questions whetheror to what extent the workman has recovered his earning capacity.(b) It removes the grievance that an improvement in the workman&apos;s earning capacity results in an automatic reduction of his compensation.(c) It avoids any ground for suspicion on the part of the workman that heis being pressed to return to unsuitable work with a view to reductionof his compensation, and the fear that if he returns to work he willjeopardise his right to further compensation; and it should remove anyhesitation he may feel in submitting to a course of rehabilitation treat-ment.   It should thus promote a more speedy recovery.(d) It helps to meet the complaint often made that no compensation isprovided for mutilation or disfigurement except in so far as it causesloss of earning capacity.(iv) The Government have considered whether in conjunction with the newprinciple of assessment there might be rates of benefit varying according tocompartments of earnings, so that the higher paid workman would receivebenefit at a higher rate than the lower paid workman. It is, however, impos-sible to reconcile this differentiation of benefit with uniform contributions, andit would involve the calculation of earnings, the objections to which have been set out above. Further, if there were only a few compartments there wouldbe complaints of hardship in cases where the workman&apos;s earnings just failedto qualify him for a higher rate of pension which others, perhaps in the sameemployment, might attain. On the ether hand, a large number of compart-ments would involve a precise calculation of earnings in a large number ofcases. The possibility has also been considered of differentiation betweengrades (e.g. manager, foreman, skilled or other &quot;workman), but as there are no definite and uniform grades recognised throughout industry, any such demar-cation would be entirely arbitrary.(v) The Government appreciate that in some cases of higher paid workmen,benefits at the uniform flat rates proposed in the Government scheme (para-graphs 38-46) would not work out so favourably as payments under the scheme proposed in the Report based on loss of earning capacity, but they are satisfiedthat, taking into account the new principle of assessment, the benefits underthe Government scheme will in the great majority of disability cases be morefavourable. It should be borne in mind that experience of the war pensions schemes shows that a large proportion of pensioners whose disablement is assessed at 100 per cent are capable of substantial earnings.(vi) The Government believe that arrangements on the lines proposed, whichhave worked satisfactorily in the case of civilian war injuries, can be appliedwithout difficulty to industrial injury though in some classes of industrial disease their application will call for special provisions.

and (b) whether the loss of earning capacity is properly ascribable to the injury or to other causes.(ii) The Government have come to the conclusion that the only satisfactory solution is to abandon the principle of awarding compensation in respect of loss of earning capacity, and to adopt two completely new features for the assessment of industrial pensions.

30. Fatal Cases.The Government agree that special provision should be made in fatal casesresulting from industrial accident or disease, but they do not agree with theproposal in the Report that this provision should be by way of the grant of a lump sum, in addition to social insurance benefits but taking account of them.They do not regard lump sum payments, even if administered under strict control, as a satisfactory method of assuring an income. Further, if the lump sum were to be of the order contemplated in the Government Actuary&apos;s Memo-randum on the finance of the proposals (an average of  300 where a totaldependant is left see Appendix A to the Report), they think that the pro-vision might often fall short of what is necessary and appropriate. The Govern-ment consider that provision for dependants in fatal cases should be by way ofpension or weekly allowance.31. Special Levy on Employers in the Hazardous Industries.(i) The fourth proposal in the Report which the Government cannot acceptis the proposal that a substantial part of the fund for payment of benefits shouldbe found by means of a special levy on employers in the hazardous industries.This proposal involves a departure from the principle of all &quot; standing-in &quot;with complete pooling of risks a principle which, as the Report points out, hasfound widespread acceptance and is adopted generally in other branchesof social insurance. Hazardous industries are not hazardous because theemployers in them are less active in the prevention of accidents than other employers, or because the workmen in those industries are less careful than otherworkmen. They are hazardous because of the nature of the employment andthe inherent risks. The proposal needs, therefore, strong grounds to justify it,particularly as the special levy would fall most heavily on certain important industries which have to meet foreign competition.(ii) The main ground advanced in the Report for this departure is that by introducing &quot; merit rating,&quot; i.e. fixing the employees contribution accordingto the risks either in particular industries or in individual undertakings, a realfinancial incentive would be given to employers to take measures for theprevention of accidents. The Government are not satisfied that merit ratingbased on the risks in particular industries would have this effect. Merit ratingon this basis is, in fact, the general practice on which insurance against work-men^ compensation risks is conducted under the present system in the hazardousindustries, and it is applied not merely to a part but to the whole of the chargeinvolved by the Acts; but it would not appear from the Reports of the Depart-mental Committees of 1904* and ig2of which enquired into the operation* Cmd. 2208.t Cmd. 816.of the Acts, or from any other information in the possession of the Government,that this practice has made any significant contribution to safety. It must beborne in mind that a substantial number of accidents are due to causes outsidethe employees control many, for example, are attributable to risks inherent in the conditions of the employment, as in the mining industry where manyaccidents occur through the operation of released natural forces. Moreover,the whole charge in respect of industrial compensation is, and under any new scheme will continue to be, a comparatively small item in relation to wages andother costs of production. As regards merit rating according to risks in individual undertakings, this system might, if it were possible to introduce it onan extensive scale, prove more effective, though even so, the variation of premiums or levies would be of small amount. Having regard, however, to the wide differences in conditions between different works, due largely to causesoutside the employer&apos;s control, the Government do not think that any systemof this kind could be operated on an equitable basis, and they feel sure that thecomplication and expense involved-in any such system would be out of all proportion to the results likely to be achieved.(iii) The proposal in the Report is to define hazardous industries as &quot; thosehaving materially more than the normal risk of accident and disease in industry as a whole.&quot; There are wide variations in the hazards of different branches ofthe same industry, some processes being hazardous and others not: and, more-

over, industrial hazards are not constant but are subject to frequent change.It follows that there would be great difficulties of definition, and there would consequently be much scope for contention as to whether particular industries or branches of industries were rightly included in, or excluded from, the hazard-ous list at any given time. Complications would also arise from the existenceof large undertakings engaged in a wide variety of production, including pro-cesses belonging to different industries, some hazardous and some comparativelysafe.(iv) If a special levy on employers in hazardous industries were adopted, it isdifficult to see why it ought not to be extended to the workers engaged in those industries. The prevention of accidents in these as in other industries dependsin large part on the care exercised by the workmen, and it may be argued thatin their case, as in the case of the employers, it is desirable to emphasise theneed for constant vigilance.(v) For these reasons the Government do not consider that the proposal fora special levy is justified. Their view is that for further progress in preventionof accidents reliance must be placed on other means, such as the developmentof the standards set up under the Factories, Mines and other safety enact-ments, and increasing co-operation between employers and workmen. In anumber of hazardous industries joint machinery for dealing with safety ques-tions already exists sometimes under statutory powers and sometimes throughvoluntary action and the Government would welcome the establishment ofsuch joint bodies in all industries in which there are substantial risks of indus-trial accident and disease.(vi) They accordingly propose that, following the principle in Health and unemployment Insurance, the whole cost of the benefits under the scheme should be borne by weekly contributions from employers and workmen,with a contribution from the Exchequer, without discrimination betweenindustries.V.-GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS FOR INDUSTRIAL INJURYINSURANCE SCHEME32. (i) The following is an outline of the new scheme proposed by the Govern-ment. Several important questions remain to be settled as for example, thespecial provisions which will be required to adjust the Scheme in its applicationto seamen and to cases of industrial disease; there are also many details whichwill require- further consideration in the working out of the full scheme, and discussion with representatives of employers and workmen will be necessary.(ii) In view of the special benefits which it is proposed to provide, the Schemecannot be unified with the general scheme of social insurance, but must betreated as a separate branch of social insurance.(iii) The benefits provided under the Scheme will take the place of the cash benefits payable under the general scheme in cases of disability and of the widow&apos;s, orphan s and guardian benefits in cases of death. No funeral benefit will be payable under this Scheme: this will be provided by the death grantproposed under the general scheme of social insurance.33. Scope of Scheme.(i) The Scheme will cover broadly all persons working under a contract of service or apprenticeship, so that it will correspond closely with Class I ofthe classification under the general social insurance scheme. It will not applyto those under school-leaving age, but otherwise it is intended to cover all classesof persons covered by the existing Acts and it will apply to non-manual workerswithout any income limit. No provision is contemplated for &quot; contracting out &quot; schemes such as are permitted under the existing Acts.(ii) The Scheme will apply to personal injury by accident arising out of andin the course of employment, and to specified industrial diseases. It is pro-posed to adhere generally to the principles at present recognised in extending

the Acts to diseases due to industrial employment. The Government are aware of the criticisms which have been made of the phrase &quot; arising out of andin the course of employment,&quot; but they do not think any other form of wordswould be found in practice to be more satisfactory. They consider it essentialto provide that there should be a causal connection between the injury and theemployment.(iii) It is also proposed that the provision in the existing Act for personsbeing trained for, or engaged in, rescue work in mines should be extended tocover rescue work and other specified classes of emergency work in connectionwith industrial undertakings generally.(iv) The present Act provides that if it is proved that the injury is attribu-table to the serious and wilful misconduct of the workman any compensationclaimed in respect of that injury shall, unless the injury results in death orserious and permanent disablement, be disallowed. It is proposed to include asimilar provision in the new Scheme.34. Finance.(i) An Industrial Injury Insurance Fund will be set up out of whichall benefits and administrative charges will be paid. The Fund will be main-tained by weekly contributions from employers and workmen, with a contri-bution from the Exchequer.(ii) Employers and workmen will pay the same weekly contributions. Equalcontributions will be required for the main benefits under the general schemeof social insurance, and from the workman&apos;s point of view it would seem desirable that he should be on an equality in this respect with the employer.Moreover, it is proposed (paragraphs 35 and 36) that workers and employers should share equally in the development and administration of the Scheme,being equally represented on the Advisory Committee or Council and on thelocal appeal tribunals, and equal contributions are a natural, if not necessary,corollary of such arrangements. Under this arrangement, employers and workmen will each contribute five-twelfths of the cost and the Exchequer will contribute one-sixth.(iii) Women will receive the same basic rates of benefit as men, but sincethe allowances proposed for dependants see paragraphs 40 and 46 will be payable mainly to or in respect of dependants of male workmen, the rates of contribution for women will (as under the general scheme) be lower than those for men. There will also be lower rates of contributions with lower rates of benefits for juveniles under 18.(iv) The contributions will be collected by stamp, together with the contri-butions under the general scheme of social insurance. The employer will paythe joint contribution and will have the right to deduct the workman&apos;s sharefrom his wages.(v) Benefit will not depend on a contribution qualification.(vi) The contributions will not be payable when the workman is incapacitatedfor work or unemployed.35. General Administration.(i) Although the Scheme will be separate from the general scheme of social insurance, the administration of the two schemes should be integratedto the fullest possible extent; and, for this reason and on grounds of economy,the Government propose that the general administration and supervision ofthe working of. the Industrial Injury Insurance Scheme should be entrusted tothe authority responsible for the general scheme and that the offices and staffset up under that scheme should be used wherever possible.(ii) The Government also consider it important to provide for the collabora-tion of industry in the development and administration of the Scheme, andthey propose that an Advisory Committee or Council should be set up on which employers and workmen would be equally represented, for the purpose of advising the Authority on important questions of policy and administrationreferred to them.

(iii) Questions as to insurability and liability to contribute will be settled,as under the general scheme of social insurance, by the central authority sub-ject to the right of that authority in special circumstances to submit thequestion for decision to the High Court (in Scotland, the Court of Session). a party aggrieved by a decision of the central authority will have a right ofappeal to the High Court (in Scotland, the Court of Session) on questions of law.36. Procedure for Settlement of Claims(i) All claims will, in the first instance, be dealt with by an IndustrialPensions Officer located in the local Social Insurance office, one of whose dutieswill be to advise and assist applicants for benefits under the Scheme in the submission of their claims. Claims in respect of disablement will normally be met on an application by or on behalf of the workman (giving such particulars of the injury and family responsibilities as may be prescribed, and accom-panied by a certificate from his medical adviser or hospital authority) and onconfirmation of the injury by the employer. The workman will continue asat present to be under an obligation to give notice of his injury to the employer and the employer will be required to report the injury to the Pensions Officer.In cases of doubt the Pensions Officer will make such further enquiry as may seem desirable, and will have the right to require the applicant to submit toan examination by an appointed Medical Officer. In cases of industrial disease,it may be necessary to require, in lieu of a certificate from the workman&apos;s owndoctor, a certificate from the Examining Surgeon appointed under the FactoriesAct or some other specially appointed medical officer or authority. It is contemplated that the certification of silicosis, asbestosis, and other forms ofpneumoconiosis will be carried out as at present by a special medical board,and similar machinery may be necessary for other industrial diseases.(ii) The decision of the Industrial Pensions Officer on questions of entitle-ment (e.g. whether the injury arose out of and in the course of employment;whether the disablement or death was due to the injury or whether it was due to serious and wilful misconduct; and, except so far as may be otherwise pro-vided, on other questions arising in connection with the determination of claims) will be subject to appeal to a local appeal tribunal, on which employersand workmen will be equally represented, presided over by an independent chairman with legal qualifications. It will also be open to the PensionsOfficer to refer any such question to the local appeal tribunal without himselfgiving a decision. Where in a particular case medical issues are involved or are likely to arise, provision will be made for one or more medical practitionersto join the tribunal either as members or in an advisory capacity.(iii) There will be further rights of appeal to an Industrial Injury InsuranceCommissioner on leave being given either by the Chairman of the local appeal tribunal or by the Commissioner on questions of law or on such other questions as may be prescribed. The Commissioner will be appointed by the Crown,and his decision will be final. Provision will also be made for the appointmentof one or more deputy Commissioners with power to act in place of theCommissioner.(iv) The medical assessment for pension, when the workman&apos;s condition isconsidered to warrant it, will be made by a medical board, and it is contem-piated that the Medical Boards of the Ministry of Pensions might be utilised for this purpose. There will be rights of appeal against a final assessment,or in certain cases against an interim assessment, to a tribunal consisting of a chairman of a local appeal tribunal and two medical practitioners.(v) Any arrangements necessary for medical supervision will be made by theauthority responsible for the Scheme, who will have power to require theinjured workman to furnish medical certificates from time to time and to undergoany medical treatment or rehabilitation certified by the appropriate authorityto be desirable in the workman&apos;s own interests.37. Benefits.(i) In framing the benefits o below, the Government have had regard to the provision made in *ting Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts,the war pensions schemes, and the proposals for the general social insurance

scheme. The main benefits in industrial disablement cases will consist of an industrial injury allowance followed, in cases of permanent or prolongeddisablement, by an industrial pension. In both cases allowances will bepaid in respect of family responsibilities.(ii) In view of the Government scheme of family allowances special provision will be made in the Industrial Injury Insurance Scheme only for the first child.(hi) The Appendix to this Paper contains (a) a comparison between therates of injury allowance and pension for 100 per cent, disablement for adultsproposed under this Scheme and the rates for total incapacity under the beveridge plan and under the existing Acts, and (b) a comparison between thebenefits in fatal cases under this Scheme, the Beveridge plan and the existing acts.38. Industrial Injury Allowance.An injury allowance will be payable so long as the workman remains inca-pacitated for work as the result of an industrial injury, unless it is replaced byan industrial pension. The rate of the allowance will be initially 35s. weekly,but if the workman has not previously been assessed for pension it will beraised at the end of the thirteenth week to the industrial pension rate for100 per cent, disablement. As under the existing practice of workmen&apos;compensation, the injury allowance will not be payable in respect of the first three days if incapacity lasts less than four weeks.39. Industrial Pension.(i) Where the disablement is likely to be permanent or prolonged, the injuryallowance will be replaced by an industrial pension based on the degree of disablement caused by the injury as assessed by the medical board. an industrial pension will, unless the workman&apos;s condition&apos; permits of a finalassessment of the extent of the disablement, be awarded on a temporary basis until a final assessment can be made. If at any time a workman ceases to be incapacitated for work but still suffers some disablement on account ofthe injury, he will be entitled to apply for a pension to be assessed forthwith.(ii) The rate of pension proposed where the degree of disablement due to the injury is assessed at 100 per cent, will be 40s. weekly. Where the degree of disablement is assessed at less than 100 per cent the pension will be propor-tionate to the degree of disablement.(iii) Following the practice in war pensions, special provision will be madefor the pensioner who notwithstanding remedial measures remains, by reasonof his industrial injury, virtually unemployable. In such cases a personalsupplement of 10s. weekly will be provided.40. Family Allowances.The following allowances will be payable, in addition to the injury allowanceor pension.(i) An allowance will be payable in respect of a wife to whom the workmanwas married at the date of the injury.and who was either residing with orwholly or mainly dependent on him. Where the injury allowance is 35s. the allowance for a wife will be 8s. gd. weekly, and where it is 40s., or where a100 per cent, disablement pension is awarded, it will be 10s. weekly.(ii) An allowance will be payable in respect of a first child of the workmanwho is wholly or mainly dependent on him. Where the injury allowance is35s., the allowance for the child will be 5s.; and where it is 40s., or where a 100 percent, disablement pension is awarded, it will be 7s. 6d. weekly. The allowance will be payable up to the age of 15 and thereafter so long as the child remainsunder full time instruction in a school (or is an apprentice) up to the 31st Julyfollowing the 16th birthday. &quot; Child &quot; will include a child of the workmanwho was born not later than 9 months after the date of the injury, or a stepchildwhose mother or father was married to the workman before the injury, or a child legally adopted by the workman before the injury.(iii) Where a pension at less than the 100 per cent, rate is awarded, allow-

ances proportionate to the pension will be payable in respect of the wife and first child.(iv) Where no wife&apos;s allowance is payable the workman will be entitled, solong as he remains incapable of work as a result of the injury, to claim an allowance, at the rate for a wife, in respect of one adult person in respect ofwhom a dependant allowance would be payable under the general scheme of social insurance in cases of ordinary disability. Thus a workman will be ableto claim an allowance (subject to the same conditions as will apply under thegeneral social insurance scheme) in respect of an invalid father or widowedmother, or adult sister or daughter, or a housekeeper, whether resident ornon-resident, who looks after his dependent children.(v) Where a personal allowance is awarded in respect of virtual unemploy-ability, allowances at the 100 per cent rate in respect of a wife and first childwill be payable irrespective of the date of marriage or the date of birth of the child.41. Maintenance in Hospital and Treatment Allowance.(i) A workman admitted to hospital for treatment will be entitled under thenew National Health Service to be maintained in hospital without charge.It is proposed under the general social insurance scheme that the benefits under that scheme shall be reduced during maintenance in hospital in respect ofhome savings after twenty-eight days. Under the existing Workmen&apos;s Com-pensation Acts the weekly payment to the disabled workman has not been subject to reduction during his maintenance in hospital and in view of this itis proposed that the workman disabled by industrial injury and removed to hospital shall receive his cash benefits in full without deduction, as part of thespecial benefits provided under this Scheme.(ii) Where an industrial pensioner has to re-enter a hospital or institutionfor further approved treatment for disability due to his injury, his pension willwhilst undergoing such treatment be at the 100 per cent, rate with full family allowances related to his responsibilities at the time, but the pension will besubject to a deduction of ios. a week in respect of home savings.42. Allowance for constant attendance.Where a workman has been awarded an industrial pension for disablementassessed at 100 per cent., and needs constant attendance on account of the dis-ablement, he may be awarded a special allowance at a weekly rate notexceeding 20s.43. Women.Women will be entitled to injury allowance and pension at the same basic rates as men. A married woman whose husband is wholly or mainly dependenton her earnings and incapable^ of self-support will be entitled to.an allowance for her dependent husband (at the rate for a wife) together with an allowance in respect of a first child, subject to the conditions applicable to the first child of a male workman. Where no husband&apos;s allowance is payable, a woman maybe awarded an allowance for a dependant on the conditions applicable to amale workman.44. Juveniles.The rates of benefit for unmarried workmen under 18 years of age will behalf the rates for an adult, to be raised to the adult rate on attaining 18 yearsof age.   Any dependant&apos;s allowances payable will be at the full rates.45. Minor Injuries.Where an injury results in only a minor degree of disability, provision willbe made for a final settlement by an award of a gratuity, or of a temporary allowance at a special rate with or without a final gratuity. If successiveinjuries occur resulting eventually in substantial disablement, the case will be reviewed on the basis of the disablement resulting from the combinedinjuries.

46. Pensions and Allowances in Fatal Cases.The following provision will be made for the payment of pensions and allowances to widows and children and to other dependants of the workmansubject to the conditions set out in each case and to the general conditions asto dependency mentioned in sub-paragraph (ix) below.(i) The. widow of a deceased workman, who was married to him previous tQthe injury and was resident with him at the time of death, will receive (a) if sheis 50 years of age or over, or being under that age has the care of a child of the workman or is incapable of self-support, a pension of 30s. weekly and, (b) inother cases, a pension of 20s. weekly. - If she would have qualified under thegeneral scheme of social insurance for a widow&apos;s benefit at a higher rate for an initial period following the death, an allowance at that rate will be payable for a similar period and pension will begin when the allowance ends. Wherea widow under 50 years of age is awarded a pension at the 30s. rate becauseshe has the care of a child of the workman, the pension will continue at this rate when the child ceases to be qualified for allowance if she has then attained the age of 50 years. In the case of a widow who was separated from the workman, provision will be made for the award of a pension in accordance withany payment she has been receiving or entitled to receive from him, subjectto a maximum of the appropriate rate above. On re-marriage, the pension will cease but there will be a marriage gratuity equal to one year&apos;s pension.(ii) An allowance of 7s. 6d. weekly will be payable in respect of a first child of the workman (child being defined as in paragraph 4o(ii)). As under thegeneral scheme of social insurance, there will be a weekly allowance of 12s. (ofwhich 5s. will be provided by the Exchequer) for each child who becomes anorphan (i.e. a child both of whose parents are dead) by the death of the workman.(iii) Where the workman was in receipt at the time of death of an allowance in respect of virtual unemployability, the widow&apos;s pension and the allowance inrespect of a first child will be payable irrespective of the date of marriage or thedate of the birth of the child.(iv) A man will be eligible for a pension of 20s. weekly, on the death of his wife, if he is incapable of self-support.(v) A pension will be payable, whether or not a widow&apos;s pension is payable,to a parent who is incapable of self-support. The maximum rate of pension forone parent will be 20s. weekly or, if both parents qualify, 30s. weekly.(vi) Where no pension is payable to a widow or a parent, one other adultmember of the deceased workman&apos;s family who was residing with him at thetime of the injury, will be eligible for a pension if incapable of self-support.The maximum rate of pension will be 20s. weekly.(vii) Where no pension is payable under the foregoing provisions, a woman,whether or not a member of the deceased workman&apos;s family, who was residingwith the workman at the time of the injury, will be eligible for temporary pen-sion if she has the care of his child or children. The maximum rate will be20s. weekly and the pension will be payable so long as at least one child is withinthe qualifying age for allowance under the Scheme.(viii) Any adult member of the deceased workman&apos;s family who is noteligible for any pension under this Scheme will be eligible for a temporary allowance of 36s. weekly for 13 weeks.(ix) The foregoing pensions and allowances will be subject to the condition that the claimant was wholly or mainly dependent on the workman at the timeof the injury and either continued to be so dependent up to the date of deathor would but for the injury have been so dependent. The widow and the firstchild, will be deemed to have complied with this condition and will be treatedas wholly dependent on the deceased if they were resident with him at the timeof death; and some further modification as to the requirement of dependency atthe time of the injury will be necessary in the cases referred to in sub-paragraph(iii) above. The maximum rate in sub-paragraphs (v), (vi) and (vii) will begiven where the dependant had been wholly maintained by the workman; inother cases the amount will be proportionate to the degree of maintenancewhich had been given.   In the case of a female dependant,&apos; the pension will

cease on subsequent marriage. A person incapable of self-support means aperson prevented by reason of physical or mental infirmity of a permanentor prolonged nature from supporting himself.47. Cost(i) It is estimated that before the war the cost of workmen&apos;.s compensationpaid by employers, excluding administrative cost was about  10 millions per annum, and that the total cost including administrative cost was about 13 millions. Wartime legislation is estimated to have increased the cost ofcompensation to about  17 millions, and it will also have increased the adminis-trative cost to a substantial, though not to a proportionate, extent.(ii) Assuming rates of wages at about 25 per cent in excess of their levelin 1938, and the restoration of peacetime conditions be&apos;fore the introductionof the social securitj&apos; scheme, the Government Actuary estimated that thecost of benefits for industrial cases under the proposals in the Report (exclud-ing administrative cost) would be about  15 millions per annum, of which 10 millions was to be found by tripartite contribution and  5 millions by aspecial levy on employers in the hazardous industries (see Appendix A to theReport).(iii) It is difficult to make a comparison between the cost of the government proposals and the cost under the existing Acts or under the proposals in theReport, since the Government Scheme is based on flat rates of benefit whichare not related to earnings. The benefits under the Government scheme would, however, in some important respects be substantially more generous tothe workman that those recommended in the Report.   For example, during the&apos; first 13 weeks of incapacity the single man would get 35s. per week insteadof 24s. The cost of industrial pensions also will in most cases be substantially greater owing to the new method of assessment proposed. The Report did not fully specify the provision contemplated for &apos;fatal cases, but it seems clearthat the cost of the pensions proposed under the new scheme will be substan-tialiy higher. Whilst, therefore, it is impossible to make an accurate forecast of the total cost of benefits under the new scheme, the Government are advised that it will materiaUy exceed the cost of the proposals in the Report and islikely to be of the order of  20 millions a year.(iv) The cost of administration under the Scheme expressed as a percentageof the cost of benefits should, over the whole field, be lower than under theexisting system. The Government are advised that pending experience of theworking of the Scheme it would be wise to allow 15 per cent of the cost of benefits for administrative charges.(v) Assuming the cost of benefits under the Government proposals to be ofthe order of  20 millions, and taking a further  3 millions as the cost of ad-ministration, the Government are advised that allowing for excusals in respectof disability and unemployment, the weekly contribution required for men will be 6d. and that for women 4d. If the contribution is divided equally between employers and workers as proposed in paragraph 34, the weekly ratefor each will be 3d. for men and 2d. for women. The rates for boys and girlsunder 18 years will be half the rates for men and women. These contributions would provide five-sixths of the income of the Fund, the remaining one-sixthbeing contributed by the Exchequer.48. Overlapping of Benefits with other Schemes.The question of overlapping benefits is dealt with in the White paper on the Social Insurance Scheme. One such case where adjustment will berequired is that of the industrial pensioner who qualifies for sickness or unem-ployment benefit; another is the industrial pensioner, who becomes qualified for a retirement pension. Similarly in fatal cases, overlapping will occur if the dependants qualify for sickness or unemployment benefit or retirement pension.These, however, are only examples of the many types of case where benefitsmay overlap, and the Government have reserved the treatment of all suchcases for further consideration.

49. Medical Treatment and Rehabilitation.The medical treatment and rehabilitation of injured workmen and post-hospital rehabilitation and training will be provided as part of the general medical and post-hospital rehabilitation services organised by the health departments and by the Ministry of Labour and National Service respec-tively, though it may be reasonable that a contribution from the industrial injury Insurance Fund should be made towards the cost of the latterservice. Close contact will clearly have to be maintained between theAuthority administering the Industrial Injury Insurance Scheme and theDepartments responsible for these services, and the Authority should be ableto furnish the appropriate Departments with much useful information and advice as the result of experience of the Scheme, and of the comprehensivestatistics which it will have collected as to the incidence and effects of industrialaccident and disease. It is important that there should be consultation betweenthe Authority and these Departments on all major questions affecting the treat-ment of industrial pensioners.50. Prevention of Accidents.It is not contemplated that the Authority responsible for the administrationof the Scheme will have any responsibility for the prevention of industrialaccidents and diseases, but its position will give it a unique opportunity tocontribute valuable information in this sphere. It will be one of its functions to survey and analyse the incidence and effects of industrial accidents anddiseases over the whole of the industrial field.51. Application of the new Scheme to past cases.(i) The Report raises the question of the application of the new Schemeto cases occurring before the commencement of the Scheme. It is clear thatin any event, as recognised in the Report, there can be no re-opening of caseswhere the liability for weekly payments has been redeemed by payment of a lump sum. Nor would it seem practicable to adjust the provisions of the new scheme to fatal cases where a lump sum has been paid into Court and whollyor partially disbursed for the benefit of the widow and other dependants,and where the widow will, subject to re-marriage, be continuing to draw apension under the Widows, Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act.(ii) As regards cases of prolonged disability where the workman is stillreceiving weekly payments, the Report, whilst admitting the practical diffi-culties, suggested two alternatives for consideration:(a) that the existing payment should continue to be provided as at present,the Social Insurance Fund paying separately the additions involved inthe new scales; or(b) that the Social Insurance Fund should take over the whole responsibility and make weekly payments to the workman at the new rates.(iii) Both these alternatives would involve serious practical difficulties.There is a fundamental difference between the methods of fixing the weeklypayments under the existing Acts and under the new Scheme. It would benecessary to make a medical assessment in each case in accordance with thenew principle, but the Government are advised that it would be a matter of extreme difficulty after a lapse, in a large number of cases, of many years fora Medical Board to determine the degree of disablement due to the injuryeither at the time of the injury or at the date of their examination. Further,as regards (b) it would be necessary, as the Report points out, for the CentralFund to take over in respect of each case such reserves of insurance companies,mutual indemnity associations and individual employers as have been ear-marked for the purpose of the liability. While in the case of Insurance companies and some Mutual Indemnity Associations adequate reserves are no doubt set aside to cover the liability under the existing Acts, there will be cases wherethe provision made will be inadequate, and the Authority responsible for thenew Scheme would have to ascertain the capitalised liability of the employer and be given power to recover any deficiency from the employer or his insurers.(iv) Since the Report was published the compensation payments under theActs have been substantially increased by recent legislation and the new rates

provided by the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Temporary Increases) Act, 1943,have diminished the importance of the transfer of past cases to the Fund.The Government have come to the conclusion that the right course is to leavethe liability in past cases on the employer, in accordance with the existing acts. These Acts, including the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (TemporaryIncreases) Act, 1943, would be continued in force for the purpose, subject toany appropriate adjustment in respect of children&apos;s allowances provided under the national scheme.(v) The Government propose, however, to provide that a workman whoif he came under the new Scheme, would be deemed to be virtually unem-ployable as a result of the injury, may apply to the Industrial Injury InsuranceAuthority for a personal allowance of 10s. weekly which will be payable irre-spective of the date of the injury. The cost of such allowances would be borne,not by the employer, but b3&apos; the Central Fund.52. Alternative Remedies(i) The Report recommends (a) in the Chapter headed &quot; The Problem of alternative Remedies &quot; (paras. 258-264) the setting up of a Committee toconsider the relation, both in industrial and non-industrial cases, betweenclaims to security benefit and claims for damages in respect of personal injurycaused by negligence, and (b) in paragraph 98 (see also paragraph 81) a reviewof the law governing the liability of employers and third parties to pay damagesor compensation to workmen, or their legal representatives and dependants,independently of the provision for them proposed to be made in the new Scheme(ii) The Government agree that an inquiry under both heads [a) and (b)is desirable and have set up for this purpose a Committee with compre-hensive terms of reference under the Chairmanship of Sir Walter Monckton,K.C.V.O., K.C.&apos;Vl SUMMARY OF MAIN FEATURES  OF THE government scheme(i) Workmen&apos;s compensation will be treated in future not as part of the law of employees liability but as a social service. As, however, the new Schemedeparts from the general scheme of social insurance as regards rates of benefit and is, in many respects, assimilated to the war pensions schemes, it will notbe unified with the general scheme but will be a separate scheme. (Paragraphs24-32.)(ii) The Scheme will be comprehensive in scope, i.e. it will cover, broadly speaking, all persons working under a contract of service or apprenticeship,except those under school leaving age. It will not provide for &quot; contracting out &quot; schemes. It will apply to accidents arising out of and in the course ofemployment, and to specified industrial diseases.   (Paragraph 33.)(iii) The liability, instead of being on the individual employer, will be placed upon a Central Fund out of which all benefits, both in disablement and fatal-ases, and administrative charges, will be paid.   (Paragraph 34.)(iv) The Fund will be maintained by weekly contributions from employersand workmen collected by stamp, with a contribution from the Exchequer. The. weekly rates of contribution will be 6d. for adult men and 4d. for women, tobe shared equally between the employer and workman. The rates for juvenileswill be half these rates. Benefits will not depend on a contribution qualifica-tion.   (Paragraph 34.)(v) The Scheme will be under the general charge of the Authority responsiblefor the general social insurance scheme but provision will be made for the collaboration of industry in the development and administration of the scheme in two ways. First, an Advisory Committee or Council will be set up on which employers and workmen will be equally represented, to advise the Authority on important matters of policy and administration referred to them.- Secondly,employers and workmen will be equally represented on the local appeal tribunals.   (Paragraphs 35 and 36.)

(vi) The present procedure by which the workman claims against his em-ployer, subject to appeals to Courts of Law, will be superseded by a system under which claims will be dealt with by a Pensions Officer subject to rightsof appeal to local tribunals, and further rights of appeal to an Industrial InjuryInsurance Commissioner whose decision will be final.   (Paragraph 36.)(vii) In disablement cases, benefits will be at uniform flat rates. They will consist of an industrial injury allowance payable for an initial period while the workman is incapacitated for work, to be replaced, in cases where the disable-ment is likely to be permanent or prolonged, by an industral pension, which willbe supplemented by a special allowance if the pensioner is unemployable.Allowances will be given for family responsibilities. Treatment allowances and allowances for constant attendance will be provided in certain circumstances.(Paragraphs 37 to 45.)(viii) The industrial pension will not be based on loss of earnings, but on the degree of disablement due to the injury. The degree of disablement will be assessed by a medical board, subject to certain rights of appeal to a specialtribunal, on a comparison of the condition of the workman resulting from the injury with the condition of a normal healthy person of the same age and sex.The pension will be unaffected by subsequent earnings. No provision will bemade for commutation of the pension by a lump sum payment. (Paragraphs29 and 39.)(ix) Where the injury results in only a minor degree of disability, provision will be made for a final settlement by an award of a gratuity, or of a temporary allowance at a special rate with or without a final gratuity.   (Paragraph 45.)(x) In fatal cases, provision will be made for payment of a pension to the widow with an allowance for the first child. Where the first child is an orphan,a higher rate of allowance will be payable. In addition, provision will be madein certain circumstances for payment of a pension to one or both parents, or where no widow or parent&apos;s pension is payable, the payment of a pension toone adult dependent member of the deceased workman&apos;s family. provision will be made for payment of temporary benefits in certain other cases.(Paragraph 46.)
