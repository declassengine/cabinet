THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1/Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1944.SECEET.Copy No.W,p. (44) 363.1st July, 1944.WAR CABINET.CLOSER UNION BETWEEN SOUTHERN RHODESIA, northern rhodesia AND NYASALAND.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andthe Secretary of State for the Colonies.DURING the visit of the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia to thiscountry, we had discussions with him on the question of closer union betweenSouthern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which formed the subjectof our memorandum W.P. (44) 191 of the 6th April. In accordance with theconclusion of the War Cabinet on the 27th April W.M. (44) 58th, Conclusion 5 we informed him that the United Kingdom Government considered amalgamation of the three territories under existing circumstances to be impracticable. At thesame time we informed him of the importance which we attached to the closest possible co-ordination of policy between the three Governments, and we put tohim proposals for a permanent Inter-Territorial Council in the form which theWar Cabinet had approved. We told him that, in our view, any statemen tregarding closer co-operation between the territories would have to make it clearthat amalgamation is not practicable in existing circumstances.2. Sir Godfrey Huggins, while disappointed at the decision, did not seemto be surprised or unduly upset by it. He said that he would have to consult hiscolleagues about a public announcement, but gave the impression that he thoughtit likely that they would wish the announcement to be made at an early date.We were very careful to avoid appearing to press the Southern Rhodesia Govern-ment on this point. One must, of course, bear in mind the possibility that anannouncement at this stage might arouse public controversy here and in the territories concerned. Moreover, there is the further, though more remote, chance that it might stir up opinion in the Union with regard to the future of the high commission Territories. But the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland have pressed for an early statement to clarify the position. Moreover,it would clearly be practically advantageous to set up the Inter-TerritorialCouncil as soon as possible. On balance, therefore, if the Southern rhodesia government should favour an early announcement, we recommend that we should proceed accordingly. We should like to have the authority of our colleagues forthis course.C.O. S.1st July, 1944.[27749]
