It is issued for the personal use of............/Ot^r^!^TOP SECRET. Copy No.  36W.P. (44) 381.14*A July, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER THE GERMANARMISTICE.Memoeandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. This paper focuses the main issues arising from W.P. (44) 380 (Memo-randum by the Chiefs of Staff), W.P. (44) 373 (Memorandum by the Minister ofProduction), W.P. (44) 362 (Memorandum by the Ministers of Labour and national Service and of Reconstruction), and W.P. (44) 379 (Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour and National Service).2.   In Stage II there will be four main objectives before us : (a) To make our contribution to the Japanese war and the Forces ofoccupation in Europe.(b) To re-expand our contracted export trades so that we can begin to move towards the position where we can pay with exports for our necessaryimports.(c) To rebuild our cities and begin to overtake the arrears of housing, andmaintenance.(d) To raise somewhat the greatly reduced standards of civil consumption.The allocations of man-power must give appropriate weight to each of these fourrival claims.3. The Military Needs of Stage II: (i) Forces.The estimated requirements of the three Armed Forces are put at 3,400,000in W.P. (44) 380. The Chiefs of Staff give in their Report (paragraph 4) a broadanalysis of this figure, which shows the distribution of man-power between thethree Services (Navy 820,000, Army 1,768,500 and R.A.F. 816,000), and indicatesthe proportion of effort to be applied to the various military commitments. they state that any substantial reduction of this man-power must inevitably be accompanied by a scaling down of the tasks which they are asked to undertake.4. The Military Needs of Stage II: (ii) Munitions.In considering our man-power requirements for munitions in Stage II, wemust make certain assumptions regarding assistance from North America. Forthe purpose of this Paper I will assume that we receive in the first year of Stage IIthe assistance from North America for which we propose to ask, and thereforeI take the lower figure in the Minister of Production^ Paper for the employment on munitions 2,650,000.I regard that measure of assistance equivalent in the case of the UnitedStates to about 1,250,000 British workers, and in that of Canada to about 500,000British workers as a favourable assumption. But it is so clearly necessary thatwe receive such assistance and receive it on Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid terms,that I am unwilling to base these calculations on a worse hypothesis.[27794]
5. Ex-ports.The possibility of maintaining an adequate standard of living and providingfull employment after the war will depend on our success in achieving a great increase in our exports as compared with the pre-war volume. This cannot, ofcourse, be achieved in Stage II, but it is of urgent importance to enable our exportsto get as good an initial start as possible in Stage II; otherwise our competitorswill get ahead of us and our export prospects will be permanently injured.The Board of Trade and Ministry of Supply, in agreement with the Treasury,have framed their estimates on the basis of achieving at the end of the first year after the German war a labour force directly employed on exports about equal(taking the group of industries concerned as a whole) to that employed beforethe war. The group of industries for which the Board of Trade and Ministryof Supply are responsible account for the bulk of the export trade. The man-power requirement put forward for this group is just over 1,110,000 workers.Certain other industries (notably coal, and food and drink) which made animportant contribution to exports before the war, will not be able to re-enter their export markets on the pre-war scale during the first year of Stage II; in the viewof the responsible Departments, supply difficulties will probably prevent these industries from raising their exports much above present levels. The man-powerrequirement for export in these industries in the first year is, therefore, put at only 40,000, as against a pre-war figure of some 200,000.The total requirement now put forward for all exports is thus 1,150,000workers, which is about 150,000 less than employment in a good pre-war year.Even if this man-power target were reached by the end of the first year, thetime-lag involved in production would mean that the receipts from exports wouldnot reach the level predicted which is below pre-war until some time later.6. The Building Industry.I have taken the requirement for building and civil engineering at the figureof 927,000 submitted to the Reconstruction Committee (R. (44) 49). This figure(as is made clear in W.P. (44) 362), though sufficient to cover the first year of thepost-war building programme, on certain assumptions as to efficiency andabsenteeism, would not cover in full the requirements of the second-year programme. No allowance is made in the figure of 927.000 or elsewhere forpre-fabricated housing, as no official estimate is yet available. I have thereforeadded a token figure of 100,000 to cover the production of pre-fabricated houses.7. The Improvement of Civil Standards.I turn now to the estimated requirements of those industries and serviceswdiich provide for the Home Market, The total estimated demand for man-power at the end of the first year of Stage II in this very broad category, after excludingbuilding and National and Local Government Service, amounts to about11-5 million as against a total of about 12-75 million in&apos;1939. Both thesetotals include workers employed indirectly on exports. Both also include workersin civil industries and services employed on account of the Armed Forces (e.g., inmaking clothing, or in transporting supplies). The numbers so engaged in thefirst year of Stage II will, of course, be appreciably greater than those so engagedin 1939. Thus the difference of 1-j million between the requirements for the endof the first year of Stage II and the number employed in 1939 does not show thefull extent of the decline from pre-war civilian standards which these requirements involve.The estimated requirements in the manufacturing industries in Group IIIwould raise the labour employed for the home market from the level of a little over half of pre-war, at which they now stand, to about four-fifths of pre-war ineffect bridging about one-half of the gap between present and pre-war levels ofproduction in these industries. The estimated requirements for the home market in Group I,(engineering) industries would raise them to almost the pre-war level.Such allocations would not, of course, quickly restore actual consumption to these levels, not only because of the time required to re-conversion and manufacture, butalso because of the need to rebuild stocks at every stage of manufacture anddistribution. In Group I industries, moreover, much of the activity will go intothe repair, maintenance and replacement of capital equipment and not immediately into an improvement of civil standards. The requirements putforward for the various services for the civil population (the chief of which arethe distributive trades) involve only a slight improvement in the present positionand therefore standards well below those which existed before the war.   They are,
however, subject to certain qualifications (given in paragraph 3 (e) of W.P. (44)362) about the extent to which labour controls will be able effectively to hold these services down to the levels assumed.8.   Thus, as a result of inter-departmental discussions by (a) the Chiefs of Staff for Service needs;(b) the J.W.P.S. for munitions needs;(c) the Ministry of Labour and National Service and the Office of theMinister of Reconstruction and the Departments concerned for civilneeds;the requirements can beIServices ...Civil Defence^ ...Other Government Service(National and Local,including industrialstaffs) ...Munitions (Group I)   ...Direct ExportsBuilding     and     civil engineering  ...All  Others  (principallyHome Market)Total* Police and National Fire Service.t 2,650,000 employees in respect of shipbuilding, engineering and allied industries, and chemicals and explosives, and an adjustment of 73,000 in respect of elements in Group Iindustries.i Including 100,000 for pre-fabricated housing, a large proportion of which will not bebuilding and civil engineering labour.9. It has not been assumed in these estimates that in the second year of stage II we shall be able to make any reduction in the man-power required forthe Services and munitions industries below, whatever figure is adopted by theWar Cabinet for the end of the first year. This means that no restoration of civilian standards, beyond that which results from whatever increase in the labour force working on civil account is made during the first year, will be possible for at least a further twelve months. In particular, the requirements now putforward for building are inadequate to achieve in full the second year of thehouse-building programme.I suggest that this factor should not at present be taken into account in determining the distribution of man-power for the first year of Stage II. Itshould be enough to keep the position under continuous review, so that if towardsthe end of the first year it appeared reasonable to assume that the Japanese war would not last the full two years at present assumed it would be possible to makerapid adjustments, particularly in the production of munitions, which would give further alleviation to the civilian population.as follows : -(Thousands)Estimated Require-1939 End-1944 ments at end of first(estimated)        (estimated)     year of Stage II.477 4,825 3,40080 246 1461,385 1,804 1.9101,150 4,117 2,6501.73 JT1,300 300 1,1501,310 638 1,027112,753 9,775 11,49018,455 21,705 21,84610. Man-power  Supplies.On the assumption that the war with Germany ends in 1944, the Ministerof Labour and National Service estimates that the total available supply ofman-power at the end of the first year of Stage II (for this purpose 1945) will be alittle over 20 millions (see paragraph 3 of W.P. (44) 379). This assumes no increase in unemployment.11. Deficiency.There is thus a gap of over If million between the estimated man-powersupplies and the requirements which would have to be met if all of the fourobjectives set out in paragraph 2 above were to be achieved simultaneously.
12. Conclusions.It is evident that we cannot hope to find the man-power to fulfil all thepresent programmes for Stage II. The problem with which we are faced is soto distribute the deficiency that the best possible balance among the differentobjectives is achieved. It seems clear that both Service and civilian demandsmust suffer some reduction. A cut of If millions in the Service and munitionsdemands would involve reducing our military commitments to an extent whichis not practicable. On the other hand, if exports are to be revived and thebuilding programme to be set going, to allow the full deficiency to fall upon theother civilian demands would mean that there would be nothing to spare for there-equipment of industry or for improving our present low standards of lifefor at least a further twelve months after the German Armistice.13. I suggest that the War Cabinet might approach this problem along thefollowing lines. An allocation of man-power to the Services and their supply departments should first be fixed. To do this the War Cabinet will have toindicate what, if any, of the military commitments are to be curtailed, and. broadlyhow any cuts are to be borne between the three Services, bearing in mind thatthe effect on the requirements for munitions labour of a cut in Forces of occupationwill be far less than the effect of a cut in Forces taking part in the war against japan. When rulings on these points have been given, it should be possible togive an overall figure for the Services and Supply Departments within which some adjustments could be made when the effect of the Cabinet decision is beingworked out.When the War Cabinet have fixed the level at which the Services and munitions industries are to be maintained, further detailed study must be madeof the best means of distributing the balance of the available man-power amongthe other claimants. The War Cabinet should, however, give general rulings onthe weight to be given to the other three objectives, namely : (a) the restoration of our export trade (which is fundamental for therestoration of our long-term economy);(b) the achievement of the rate of expansion now proposed for post-warbuilding;(c) the general restoration of other civilian standards.In the light of the guidance so given it would be possible to elaborate detailed proposals in respect of each of these three objectives. The third, namely, therestoration of civilian standards generally, involves consideration of manyalternative distributions of the available man-power among a large number ofdifferent industries, and. these would have to be worked out in detail.The guidance given by the War Cabinet on these points will also determine the broad pattern of the presentation of our case to the Americans when we askfor the continuance of lend-lease to cover our needs in Stage II. For this reasonamong others an early decision is important.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S,.W. 1,14th July, 1944.
