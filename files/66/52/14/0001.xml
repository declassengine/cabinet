THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT \--.------ .-.---Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET. Copy No. &amp; 0W.P. (44) 364.3rd July. 1944.WAR CABINET.FRENCH FORCES OF THE INTERIOR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a note indicating the steps which ithas been possible to take to ensure as far as-possible that members of the french forces of the Interior captured by the enemy are treated as prisoners of war.Ai E.Foreign Office, 3rd July, 1944.ANNEX.On the 9th June the French Committee of National Liberation issued adecree whereby the French &quot;Maquis&apos;&apos; fighters were constituted the &quot;french forces of the Interior,&quot; with the full status of regular members of the Frencharmed forces. Their new status was implicitly endorsed by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government in consequence of the subsequentagreement whereby the French Forces of the Interior became an integral part ofGeneral Eisenhower&apos;s command under the orders of General Koenig.2. On the 11th June the German Commander-in-Chief in France broadcasta statement to the effect that the German Government regarded the French Forcesof the Interior as -&quot; francs-francs-tireurs&apos;&apos; and would treat them as such if captured(this means that they would be liable to be shot). The French Committee repliedwith a statement claiming prisoner-of-war status for captured members of theForces of the Interior on the basis of its decree of the 9th June, and threatening&quot; the necessary counter measures &quot; if the Germans treated them as &quot; francs-francs-tireurs.&quot; The Committee has further sent a protest to the German government through the International Red Cross and has asked His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the United States Government to back it up.3. It is clearly desirable that our two Governments should do what they canto protect the Forces of the Interior. There are, however, two difficulties : (i) Wecannot take reprisals, and must discourage the French from doing so, for fearof counter-reprisals against our own prisoners (one unit in the &quot; Maquis &quot; hasalready announced the shooting of German prisoners as a reprisal for the shootingof its own wounded. We cannot stop this sort of thing. The real danger lies inretaliation against regular prisoners held by the French in North Africa),(ii) Nor can we make out a strong legal case to show that the Germans are breakingtheir obligations under International Law if they treat the Forces of the Interioras &quot; francs-francs-tireurs.&quot;4. In the circumstances the following is considered the most promisingcourse of action : (a) The French Committee should announce that after the warsteps will be taken to punish Germans known to have treated members of theForces of the Interior in a way inconsistent with the rules of war. (b) this statement should be. followed by an Anglo-American statement to the effect that12413   [27754]
the two Governements consider that the Forces of the Interior, being combattantunits operating under the orders of S.C.A.E.F., are entitled to be treated inaccordance with the rules of war and that their commanders in the field will help the French to bring offenders to justice and will hand over to them anyoffenders falling into British or American hands.5. A telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Charge -d&apos;Affaires at Washingtoninstructing him to seek the urgent concurrence of the United States Governmentin the above procedure is being concerted with the War Office. Meanwhile, theFrench are being urged to hold their hand.6. General Eisenhower, at the request of General Koenig, has directed thata statement should be put out by S.H.A.E.F. emphasising the regular militaryrole of the Forces of the Interior, condemning the German threat to treat them as&quot; francs-francs-tireurs &quot; and announcing that offenders will be punished. This actiondoes not conflict with the procedure suggested above.
