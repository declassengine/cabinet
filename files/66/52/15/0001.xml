THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfs GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.FEEE SIAMESE.-Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN a memorandum of the 17th April (W.P. .(44) 208) I submitted to mycolleagues a revised draft of the declaration concerning Siam which I recom-mended should be made. Consideration of this memorandum was held up pending-consultation with the Commonwealth Government (whose views were,, set out in w.P. (44) 233) and the other Dominions Governments..2. The general concurrence of the Dominions in our draft declaration hasnow been secured. The Commonwealth Government have, however,. proposed an addition to the first sentence which would indicate a desire- on our part to see thesecurity of Siam guaranteed within a general system. This amendment seems tome unexceptionable, and I submit that the declaration should be made shortly ina written reply to a Parliamentary Question.   It now reads as follows : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom favour therestoration of Siam after the war as a free, sovereign and independent Stateand wish to see its security guaranteed within a general S3rstem. Theycannot, however, forget that the Government of Luang Pibul took theinitiative in declaring war on Great Britain in spite of Siam&apos;s treaty of non-aggression with this country; and they would remind the Siamese people that they must themselves contribute to their liberation. In the final settle-ment account will inevitably be taken of that contribution.&quot;83. The Commonwealth Government state that they would wish to issue aparallel declaration of their own.4. I would add that the Political Adviser to Admiral Mountbatten hasrecently telegraphed that capital continues to be made in South-East Asia byill-disposed persons out of our apparent reluctance to disclose our policy. Theabsence of any declaration is also adversely affecting S.O.E.&apos;s relations with thoseSiamese whose co-operation is required for S.O.E.&apos;s operational projects.A. E.SECRET.
