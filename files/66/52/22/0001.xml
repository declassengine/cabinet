THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 372.4th July, 1944. /WAR CABINET. ^INDIA.MINISTERIAL GOVERNMENT IN BENGAL AND ORISSA.* Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the following note on thevicissitudes of Provincial Autonomy in two of the Indian Provinces that differgreatly in size and importance.Bengal. Bengal, under coalition Ministries, has managed to retainministerial government. continuously since 1937 except for an interval of a fewweeks in the spring of 1943 during which Section 93 came into force. The machinehas, however, run anything but smoothly; and narrowly escaped breaking clownor being scrapped for inefficiency under the stress of last winter&apos;s famine. Thepresent coalition Ministry, which has held office since April of last year, includescaste Hindus and members of the Scheduled Castes, but the majority of themembers, including the Chief Minister Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin, are Moslemsand adherents of the Moslem League. Mr. Casey believes that if the presentMinistry should collapse no alternative Ministry would in present circumstances be possible, there being no other leader commanding sufficient stable support inthe Legislature on whom he could rely for genuine co-operation in furtheringthe war effort. He is reluctant to have to take over the Administration without giving the present Ministry a fair trial; but its position in the Legislature is becoming increasingly shaky. Opposition reached its highest pitch recentlyover the Ministry&apos;s Secondary Education Bill, which was attacked as a measureinspired by communal motives by the caste Hindus who have hitherto enjoyed muchof a monopoly in the field of education. Disorderly scenes took place which the speaker (a Moslem owing his appointment to a former Ministry now largely in opposition) was unable or unwilling to control. In the absence of other Govern-ment business of consequence the Governor prorogued the Assembly on the23rd June. It is not felt possible to face the upheaval of a general election,particularly in a Province so near the scene of hostilities as Bengal.The situation has been discussed between the Governor and the viceroy and is fully reviewed in the two telegrams which I append. The upshot of these is that, while the period of prorogation gives the Ministry a breathing space, itcannot be unduly prolonged. If the Ministry appears to continue to lose groundor to let the Administration run down, Mr. Casey will feel obliged to force theissue as explained in some detail in the latter part of paragraph 3 of theViceroy&apos;s telegram No. 1320 S. by summoning the Assembly for a date early inAugust. He considers, and the Viceroy agrees, that if the&apos; Ministry then fallshe would be fully justified in taking over the Administration under&apos;Section 93.The Governor and the Viceroy have handled the situation with greattolerance and patience and have conscientiously observed the constitutionalproprieties in spite of their acute sense of the gravely inadequate standards of efficiency in the Administration. I propose to inform &quot;the Viceroy of my o-eneralapproval of the policy recommended by him and the Governor.OriSsa. This minor and recently created Province was under a CongressMinistry from 1937 until the general resignation of the Congress Ministries inthe autumn of 1939, when the Governor, in the absence of an alternative Ministry[27758]
was obliged to take over. Two years later it was found possible to form an&apos;alternative Ministry under the Maharaja of Pariakimedi, a prominent land-holder in the Province, who headed a group of 22 members corresponding to theformer opposition and formed a coalition with Godavaris Misra, a Congresssupporter, the latter heading a small group of 10 members consisting mainly of individuals in the Assembly who shortly before had broken away from theirallegiance to Congress. The remaining 28 members of a house of 60 formed the Congress following, some of them being interned. The coalition had anuneasy history and a definite split between the leaders has now broken it up. the causes of the split are personal and local and do not reflect all-India politics.Neither leader can carry on or form a new Ministry by himself, the congress party still refuse co-operation, and in the absence of a leader able to form analternative Ministry the Governor has been obliged to issue a Proclamation underSection 93 and once again take over the Administration. The Province being-small, and the causes of the breakdown being local, no important reactions onthe Indian political scene are expected.L. S. A.India Office, Uh July, 1944.APPENDICES.Cypher telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India,dated New Delhi, 29th June, 1944.(No. 1320S.)MY telegram 1286S of the 24th June. Bengal situation. I am repeatingseparately Governor&apos;s telegram 143S of the 26th June.2. 1 discussed situation with Governor on the 28th and 29th June. Weare agreed that we must do all we can to maintain parliamentary Governmentin Bengal, but that in view of food situation, weakness lof Administrationmachine and importance of Bengal as a military base we must not hesitate tomove into Section 93 as soon as we are satisfied that parliamentary Governmenthas broken down.3. Governors views appear from telegrams repeated to you. Duringdiscussion he summarised position as follows: Secondary Education Billaroused violent communal feeling and, largely owing to weakness of Nazimuddin,Opposition were able, during last session of Assembly, to develop in collusionwith Speaker obstructive technique which made all serious business impossible.Nazimuddin began session with substantial majority but many of his supporterswere won or bought over and at the end he could not afford to lose more than another six or seven of them. Prorogation of Assembly on the 23rd June gaveNazimuddin breathing space but exposed Governor to criticism for bolstering,up tottering Ministry. Immediate question was how long breathing space shouldbe. Governor&apos;s first intention was to summon Assembly for the 7th August andto announce this at once. Nazimuddin urged that in ordinary circumstances he would go to country, but that as general election was impossible he shouldbe protected by amendment of Constitution Act empowering Governor to appointand dismiss Speaker. , In any case, adjournment only to the 7th August wouldnot give him time to attempt compromise with Opposition on secondary education Bill and to rally his Moslem supporters by campaign in constituencies.He pressed for summoning of Assembly not earlier than October or November.Governor recognised impracticability of amending Constitution Act to enable himto get rid of Speaker and told me that he was most doubtful about longadjournment demanded by Nazimuddin. During session, Ministers had donepractically no departmental business, and up to next session, Ministers&apos; time would inevitably be taken up with intrigues, negotiations and meetings inconstituencies, purpose of which would be to intimidate deserters fromNazimuddin&apos;s party, Although food situation seemed reasonably secure for1944 it was still causing anxiety and might be most difficult in 1945. He couldnot contemplate letting Administration run down for several months only tobe faced in October with position similar to that in last session. In addition,he doubted if time was on Nazimuddius side. His opponents were busy making-shadow Cabinets and buying his supporters and they had a long purse. Onthese grounds it might be best to make Nazimuddin meet Opposition in august and either prove stability of his Government or resign. The longer the intervalthe greater would be the odium placed on Governor personally.   On the other
hand, he realised that having prorogued the Assembly he could not hustleNazimuddin unduly and he was prepared not to announce a date for next sessionat present and to tell Nazimuddin that he would watch the position, especiallycourse of Administration, and decide later what to do. If he found thatNazimuddin was losing ground, e.g., if a considerable number of his supportersannounced their defection, or if Administration deteriorated badly he wouldnot hesitate subject to my concurrence to summon Assembly for August andforce issue. If Nazimuddin were defeated or proved incapable of transactingbusiness he was satisfied that no one else could form a stable Government. TheEuropean group would refuse to support any other Government, and none of theOpposition leaders had a permanent following of sufficient size. Section 93would be fully justified and once applied should remain in force for a consider-able time. The Governor would favour four official advisers (Gurner, Williams,Stevens and Walker) and would go all out for an efficient Administration with-out attempting to conciliate Indian opinion by including non-officials. he thinks that though public opinion would be outwardly hostile many people wouldreally welcome Section 93 and that this is what Opposition expect. Nazimuddinhas told him that Jinnah has not yet interested himself at all.4. I agree generally with Governor, and ask covering approval now to policy he recommends, since you will presumably wish to refer to Cabinet andthere may be very little time for further discussion if and when Governor decidesto act.   I will keep you fully informed.From Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated New Delhi, 29th June, 1944.1322-S.My telegram 1320-S of the 29th June. Following is repetition of governor of Bengaks telegram 143 of the 26th June. Begins: Nazimuddin has made a very strong plea that I should not convene the Assembly in early August in view of extreme difficulties in which such action would place his Ministry.2. He says that he is going to begin discussions with Secondary education bill, but that such discussions will inevitably be prolonged and could not getanywhere before early August. He holds that if I were to announce shortly thatAssembly would meet again in early August it would mean that Opposition wouldnot make any attempt to come to terms with him over the Secondary education bill, but would use the intervening period in sharpening their teeth to attackhim again when Assembly met. He maintains that his prestige demands thatSecondary Education Bill should be first item of business when iissembly meetsagain. In order to secure his position he wants to have a clear two months&apos; periodof negotiation with Opposition on Secondary Education Bill, and he wants also tohave conducted a series of meetings in electorates of all Moslems in Assembly inorder to rally electoral opinion in Moslem electorates for Secondary Education Billso that pressure may be brought to bear on all Moslem members. He maintainsthat it is quite impossible to carry out above, and to attend to Departmental work,between now and early August.3. He says he is certain that if Assembly were to meet again in early Augusthe would be faced with another long series of want-of-confidence motions in individual Ministries, and that, in fact, no Government business would be donein a fortnight&apos;s sitting and that I would have all the trouble again of proroguingthe Assembly without any business having been done.4. He tells me there are still at least four or five of his supporters who, he believes, can be bought by the Opposition and whom the Opposition are strenuouslyout to buy. He maintains, by the way, that eleven supporters who defected latelywere bought and he claims to know what they were paid. He repeats that only means of holding these men and possibly of regaining some of his Moslemex-supporters who have recently gone over to the Opposition will be to holdrousing meetings in their electorates to mobilise public opinion against them.He would not hold such meetings in Hindu constituencies in order to avoidpossibility of communal trouble.5. He is agreeable to meeting of Assembly in first week in October. ThePuja celebrations are in last half of September.6. He argues that continuance of rational Parliamentary Government isbased, on supreme sanction that if a Chief Minister gets into position that hehas got into he can ask for the endorsement or purging that only a general electioncan bring about.   He says that every game must be played according to certain
rules and that if one of the most important rules is abolished [Le., dissolution beingimpossible) then some of the other rules have to be amended to enable the game tobe played with reasonable fairness. By this he means that in absence of possibilityof general election he should be allowed to have prorogation for sufficient time toenable him to pull his side together.7. He goes on to say that if his Ministry were to be defeated he could onlycount on 50 or 60 members of Moslem League going&apos;.into opposition with himplus some unknown but probably only small proportion of the 31 scheduled castemembers. He does not know about the European group. However, he believedthat opposition could muster a very considerable majority over what his numberswould be in opposition and that when I was faced with this I would find it verydifficult to contest the argument that present Opposition could form a stableMinistry and that I would find it even more difficult to find excuse for introducing a section 93 Government.8. In short he asks in his own words, for a fair and sporting chance to pullhis supporters together and he has mobilised considerable arguments in supportof his plea.9. I have informed Nazimuddin that he is endeavouring to put whole burden on to me. I gave him prorogation when he asked for it knowing quite well (asI told him in advance) that I would be charged with having done so in orderto protect a moribund ministry. I am, in fact, so giving him protection againsta dishonest Speaker and an opposition that is out to buy his supporters with a longpurse. But my point is that I cannot do this indefinitely. The incidence ofRamazan on 21st August and Puja holidays in latter part of September means that Assembly could meet for a fortnight only as from 7th August and next date on which they could meet would be early October. Even after hearing allNazimuddin&apos;s arguments I still believe on net balance that I should call Assemblytogether on 7th August although I recognise that there is something in hisarguments which I think he is putting forward with sincerity.10. , As for his argument that opposition could muster numbers enough tomake it difficult to refuse them opportunity to form a Government if Nazimuddinwas beaten, I think &quot; easy come easy go &quot; is answer, and I would not be impressed by stability that such a Government could offer.11. Although I fully realise that this is a matter on which I have to make up my own mind, I would be grateful for any observations on situation that youmight wish to make.12. I gather from correspondence that has passed between us recently thatif bad communal trouble were to break out or that if Nazimuddin were to bebeaten in Assembly (or even if he were publicly to lose such support to oppositionwhile Assembly is prorogued as to lose him his majority) you and Secretary ofState will agree to a Section 93 Government. However, it would be of guidance to me if I were to know whether you are keen on continuance of parliamentary government here under to-day&apos;s conditions or if alternatively you would welcome 93. My personal attitude up to present has been that if we are to haveSection 93 Goveiuiment we should only come to it through a breakdown ofParliamentary Government or through bad communal troubles and that I should avoid an &quot; imposed &quot; 93. Reasons being that one wants to avoid such antagonismof one of major communities as would make Section 93 regime difficult and also by reason of presumably bad reaction of the rest of India (and of American publicopinion) to a Section 93 that could have come about reasonablv naturally.
