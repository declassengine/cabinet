E.   .Foreign Office, 5th July, 1944.ANNEX I.Discussion with M. Topalovic.Serbia within Yugoslavia and the Serbian Nation as Political Factor in yugoslavia from the beginning of the War wp till now.1. From April 1941 to the end of 1942.At the beginning, the people were divided into political parties. Theatrocities carried out by the Germans and the terrorist regime of the conquerorsmade any political work impossible. The massacres of the Serbs in Bosniacreated, among the Serbian people, the belief that the Croat nation was responsiblefor these misdeeds. More than half a million of Serbian refugees from Bosniaand Crotia, who fled to Serbia, aggravated the hostile attitude of the Serbianagainst the Croatians by their reports. At that time, nobody in Serbia believedin the possibility of a re-establishment of Yugoslavia. -When, in 1942, the Serbians observed that the Croatian people were under-going the same sufferings at the hands of the invaders and that they had taken up resistance and active fight against the enemy, the attitude of the Serbianpeople began to change. All the Serbian political leaders began to see the neces-sity of creating a new* moderate movement which would canalise the feelings of the Serbian people and direct it in the right manner.This work was done in 1943.2. In 1943. -    -All the Serbian political groups met. First, the leaders of each politicalgroup met among themselves, and&apos;chose the representatives who would representthem at the general meeting of all groups. The groups represented at the generalmeeting were : the Radical Party, the Democratic Party, the Agrarian Party,the Socialist Party, and the Republican Party. At the same time, all the non-political organisations of Serbia also met under the leadership of Dr. Belajcic, a judge of the Court of Appeal in Belgrade.12421   [27784] . .
At the general meetings of all these parties and organisations, the followingstatements were made : (a) The Croatian people cannot be made responsible for the massacres of theSerbs in Bosnia and Croatia.(b) Only the Germans and the Ustase -who are but a handful of people inCroatia are responsible for these misdeeds, and they are not and havenever been representatives of the Croat people.(c) The Croat people, and particularly the Croatian peasants and workers,with Dr. Macek as leader, took up resistance and active fight againstthe enemy from the very beginning, exactly like the Serbian people.(d) Therefore, Yugoslavia is not only possible, but it is a necessity for allSerbs, Croats and Slovenes.(e) In future, Yugoslavia can exist as a Union of three States : the Serbian,the Croatian and the Slovene State.(/) The borders and the inner organisation of each of these States will bedecided in a constitutional way after the war.In order to advocate these opinions among the Serbian people, and in orderto create.the possibility of political work, the meeting decided to put aside all political differences among the different parties and to organise all Serbians on the single basis of service for the Serbian nation.In the course of 1943, the new movement succeeded in achieving this organisation on the following basis :In every village, the peasants chose their representatives. These representa-tives then met in a district meeting and chose the representatives for the countymeeting. At the county meeting, which comprises about 40 people, an executive of about 10 people, was elected. This Executive administers the county and functions as its political leadership. Topalovic asserts that this organisation has been established in all Serbian districts.On this basis, a general meeting was called, in which a National Council forSerbia was elected, on the 26th-28th January, 1944.   This Council now replacedthe former so-called Council of Ravnagora, which was rather of a military character.   Topalovic is the President of this, new Council, which is called the.Council of Saint Sava.The Military Organisation in Serbia.1. For all people in Serbia, military and civilians, the King is the supreme authority, in political as well as in military matters.2. According to our Constitution, the King is Commander-in-Chief of allYugoslav Forces.3. Dra2a Mihailovic is, in fact, the representative of the King within thecountry. He need not be Minister of War, but he actually is considered by thepeople as the King&apos;s deputy as Commander-in-Chief.4. The King&apos;s authority and the people&apos;s affection for him are greater than ever before. Therefore, all Serbs desire to have the King brought back into thecountry and to see him re-established in Yugoslavia, especially in Serbia.5. The active military forces operating in Serbia are small, owing to the lack of armaments and munition. But the military organisation is established ona large basis. This military organisation, as well as the above-mentioned political organisation, spreads as far as the East banks of the rivers Neretva and Bosna,but, in the area of Bosnia, between the Neretva and Bosna on the West and theDrina on the East, the superiority of the narrjsans is vptv crrftat. The nartisans&apos;movement exists also in Serbia, and especially in the area of Montenegro and the mountains of Durmitor, Kopaonik and Majica, but there Mihailovic&apos;s forces aresuperior in strength, while, in all other Serbian areas, they exist alone.6. Macedonia is a problem in itself. (Topalovic did not wish to speakabout it.)The foregoing is a survey given by Topalovic on the situation in SerbiaQuestions put to Topalovic by Me, and His Answers.1. How do the political and military factors in Serbia consider Tito&apos;sMovement?Answer. Tito&apos;s Movement fights in truth for the liberation of the people,but, at the same time, it fights for the establishment of a Communist dictatorship.
We cannot allow this to happen in Serbia and therefore we openly fight againstthe partisans. The present situation in Serbia is consolidated and we considerthat it would be a great mistake to destroy this unity of the people in Serbia.This unity would be destroyed if Tito would be imposed on Serbia as commander-in-Chief.2. Do you mean that unity would be destroyed from political reasons,because you consider Tito&apos;s Movement as a Communist Movement?Answer. This is indeed one of the reasons. But the main reason lies in thefact that Tito&apos;s Movement wish to destroy the authority of the King; and weshall never allow this authority which is the symbol of the unity of the Serbianpeople to be destroyed.3.   Do you think that we must avoid civil war at any price?Anstver. Yes, and I agree with you that we must do everything in our power towards this end.4. How do you estimate the strength of Tito&apos;s forces? And how do you suggest we should overcome these forces without terrible losses of human lives ?Answer. Yes, we estimate the strength of Tito&apos;s Movement, both in themilitary and the ideological respect, as very high, owing to the present situationand the miserable conditions of the people. We have thought this problem overand discussed it. We have come to the conclusion that, in this respect, theDomobran Army in Croatia should play a very important role. The Domobranciare not the same as the Ustase. We are convinced that the Domobran Army isa Croatian People&apos;s Army, sharing the feelings of the Croat people.In Croatia, the greatest authority is the Croat Peasant Party and, to-day,all Croatian peasants are behind Macek.5. Then, according to your opinions, you believe that the Croat people should use the Domobran Army and the peasants&apos; political organisations to fight againstthe partisans, while you will merely look on and conserve your people?Answer. We are daily coming nearer to the people of Croatia in ourfeelings, because we see that the situation in Croatia is the worst throughoutYugoslavia and we wish to help the Croat people in their fight in the spirit ofbrotherhood.6. But, in this way, we have not solved the problem of the partisans. Whatis your opinion concerning the solution of this problem in this moment ?Answer. We are prepared to enter into collaboration with the partisansand Tito, provided that the King should be made Commander-in-Chief.7. Are you prepared to sacrifice Draia Mihailovic as Deputy commander of the King ?Answer. I think we are, but the King must be Commander-in-Chief.8.   Who will be the Deputy as Commander ?Answer. -It might be a regular General of the Yugoslav Army.9. Would you agree to a Deputy Command composed of one representativeof the Tito Movement and one representative of the Yugoslav Army ?Answer. Yes, we would. We have discussed this problem and we thinkthat, during the war, there should be two operational Armies, fully co-ordinated,under the Command of the King^ one in Serbia and one in Croatia. We alsothink that, after the war, no Serbian soldier should enter Croatia, because, in thisvvav,  vvc DjmjUiU ctvtjiu. an loaao ui lcvcugc.10.   What is your attitude towards my Government ?Answer. We consider the King as the supreme constitutional factor andwe respect every legitimate Royal Government. We do not only respect thepresent Government, but are ready to support it. I can safely say that this isthe attitude of the whole Serbian people.11. What would be your attitude in case Tito should recognise the King-as legitimate authority and Supreme Commander for the duration of the warand up to the time when the people shall be able to decide on the NewConstitution ?Answer. I do not believe this to be possible, but if this should happen,I think all other problems could be solved easily.
12.   Are you prepared to enter the new Government ?Answer. &quot;We are prepared to support the legitimate Royal Government.But, as to entering it, that depends on the solution of the questions we have been discussing.ANNEX 2.Discussion with Dr. Jancikovic.Dr. Jancikovic was a Deputy of the Croat Peasant Party in the CentralParliament of Yugoslavia.We talked very much about the Croatian Peasant Party and its present organisation.1. The Croat Peasant Party has no agreement whatever with the Partisans,but there is no conflict between them. When the people meet, they naturallycollaborate.  Similar relations exist between the Domobranci and the Partisans.2. As intimate friends, we spoke openly about the present situation inCroatia concerning the Partisans&apos; Movement, the Croat Peasant Party, the resistance of the people, the attitude of the Croat people towards the Serbs, thefuture Yugoslavia; and we came to the following conclusions : (a) The present situation in Croatia can only be described as a hell.    Thepeople think of nothing but of liberation from it.(b) In Croatia there are, in reality, no differences between the. people, or between the leaderships of the people, that is to say, of the CroatPeasant Party and the Partisan Movement.(c) The leadership of the Croat Peasant Party could not enter into any formal agreement with the Partisans, because they were convincedthat such an agreement would have led to more unnecessary acts of retaliation by the Germans on the civilian population. First of all,they believe, Dr. Macek and all Deputies of the Croat Peasant party would have been killed by the Germans in this case.(d) The leadership of the Croat, Peasant Party is in close touch with the- secret committee of the Domobranci General Staff.(e) Both these military and political factors are fully prepared to start withaction provided the Allies will be also ready to help them.(/) Everything&apos; is prepared, but they must be assured that, once the people have risen, they will not be left at the mercy of the Germans&apos;barbarism.(g) Colonel Babic has been appointed by these factors as liaison officer &apos;tothe Allies and, through the Croat members of the Cabinet, to the yugoslav Government. He is prepared to give me as Ban of Croatiaand as a member of the leadership of the Croat Peasant Party -all thedetails with which he has been entrusted.(h) Colonel Babic is the most important person with regard to the problemof solving not only the Croat question, but the question of Yugo-slavia as a whole. The British authorities know that he has broughta code with him, but the key of this code is known only to him.However, I am sure, he will discover it to me.(i) Through this code, the British authorities and I myself would be ableto speak directly with the people in Zagreb.       *From the whole long discussions with Dr. Jancikovic, I can draw only oneconclusion: bring Colonel Babic to me at once.
