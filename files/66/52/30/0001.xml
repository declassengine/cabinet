We have taken no account of those short-term commitments which are likely to be completed during the year immediately following Germany&apos;sdefeat.Strategic Requirements.2. Our military commitments are governed, in the first instance, by our strategic requirements. One year after the end of the European war and untilthe defeat of Japan, these may be broadly stated as : (a) The security of the United Kingdom.(b) The continued effective control of Germany.(c) Security of Imperial L. of C, including the Middle East area.(d) The early defeat of Japan.ie) Security and political commitments in S.E. Europe.Man-power Assessments (Annexes I, II and III).3. A complete reassessment has been made by the three services of theminimum forces required to meet in full the strategical and political commitmentsoutlined above. In terms of man-power, and compared with the previousestimate,! these are : Previous NewEstimate.

The estimated strength of the services at the end of 1944 is 4,768,000;thus our latest estimate represents a reduction in man-power for the second phase of the war of 1,363,500 or 28 per cent, of the armed forces.6. In these estimates allowance has been made for savings which might beeffected by increased assistance from Dominion and Allied forces and the use ofGerman labour in base establishments. Reductions have also been made in inactivetheatres wherever possible.7. All figures must be regarded as tentative. This is particularly so in thecase of the R.A.F., as it has not yet been possible to work out in detail the basicorganisation and training which will be required, in view of the revolutionarychanges which have taken place in air warfare.Possibility of Further Reductions.8. In the following paragraphs we discuss our strategical and politicalrequirements, outlined in paragraph 2, and whether we could meet them withreduced forces.
The United Kingdom and North-Western Europe.9. It is reasonable to suppose that, by one year after her defeat, germany will have been so dealt with that her power will have been laid low for some time.Nevertheless, it will be essential from the military viewpoint to maintainsufficient forces in Germany to keep order and to ensure that the armistice termsare enforced. We consider&apos;the forces we have allowed for these purposes to be theminimum necessary to control our part of Germany, and that they depend on theprovision of adequate and readily available air forces to back them.10. Equally, the security of the British Isles is unlikely to be menaced in theyears immediately following the collapse of Germany, and purely defensive land and air forces should be reduced to a level which will permit an&quot; efficient nucleusto be maintained.   Our requirements have been, assessed on this basis.11. Forces will be required in the European theatre to uphold the final peace settlement, to maintain British influence and to protect our interests. We haveassessed the naval and military forces, but the exact size of the Air Forces isdifficult to gauge. We cannot allow ourselves to be markedly inferior in the air to any other Eurojuean Power, and our joint forces must be strong enough to dealpromptly and adequately with any outbreak which might occur in our area ofresponsibility.Security of Imperial Lines of Communication.12. Our ability adequately to prosecute the war against Japan, and our other vital interests such as oil, render the security of our Imperial L. of 0. ingeneral, and our position in the Middle East in particular, of paramount importance.13. In view of the unsettled state of affairs likely to obtain in the middle east, notably in Palestine, we consider that we have allowed a minimum of forces to ensure as far as possible the security of these areas.The War against Japan.14. We are pledged to participate in the war against Japan to the limit ofour power and, in any case, for reasons of our prestige in the Far East and inAmerica, it would be inexpedient for us not to do so to a substantial extent.15. The Naval Forces allowed for the Far East are sufficient only to providefor one strong cover or striking force in addition to those required to support a major amphibious operation. The only way in which further large savings couldbe effected would be to abandon all idea of British amphibious operations againstthe Japanese, outside the range of shore-based air support. Under these circum-stances the Fleet, and particularly the Fleet Air Arm, could be appreciablyreduced. We consider that this proposal is unacceptable since it would have amost serious effect on Allied operations against the Japanese. It is in theprovision of carrier forces and amphibious forces that the British can most effectively and directly contribute towards Japan&apos;s early defeat.16. If a Pacific strategy is adopted, the proposed British land contributionamounts to an expeditionary force of some five divisions to operate with theAustralian and New Zealand troops. The air contribution will be a small tacticalforce with the army and a strategic bomber force to take part in the direct long-range attack on Japan.In S.E.A.C. British forces from all three Services are necessary for theprotection of India and the eventual reoccupation of Burma and British posses-sions in the East Indies We have kept their strengths to a minimum for thesetasks.17. In the event of a decision being taken to confine our land and air forcesentirely to South-East Asia, the British forces that would otherwise operate in the pacific would be required in addition to those at present in S.E.A.C. for therecapture of Burma, Sumatra and Malaya, if these operations were not to be delayed until the Americans had virtually beaten the Japanese by themselves.Southern and South-Eastern Europe.18. We suggest that we should avoid as far as possible any commitments for the employment of military forces in Southern and South-Eastern Europe.,
&apos; except in the case of Austria.   An outline of these commitments has been setout by the Minister of State.*19. If, however, it is impossible to avoid accepting these commitments,we consider that owing to the isolated position and unsettled state of this partof Europe, the existence of large Allied forces, both land and air, in other partsof the Continent or in the Middle East would alone be insufficient to exercise control until stable Governments are in power. For this purpose direct contactof land forces would also be necessary. Details of the forces that might berequired are included in Appendix I to Annex II. These are substantially thesame as those which the Post Hostilities Planning Staff had estimated as theminimum requirements,! but it is difficult at this stage to make firm assessment of the size of forces required or of the duration of temporary commitments which mav need to be undertaken on the cessation of hostilities.Use of Prisoner of War Labour.20. Allowance has been made in estimating the requirements of man-power for the British Army for the employment of enemy labour to releaseBritish service personnel. The best estimate that can be made at the presenttime of the extent to which enemy personnel could be used, in addition to those already employed, would effect a saving of 55,000 in British Army man-power.Estimate of Man-power Saving effected by Abandoning certain of our strategic requirements.21. Some of our commitments, essentially military, are inescapable. These,for which forces must be allowed, are (i) The war against Japan,(ii) The security of the United Kingdom.(iii) The effective control of Germany.(iv) The security of our Imperial lines of communication and our position inthe Middle East.(v) The security of India and the eventual recovery of British possessions inthe East.22. Our remaining commitments are related more to political and economic factors. As forces are reduced, so our power and prestige will diminish and our ability to take an active share in the war against Japan, and thus hasten herdefeat, will decrease.23. If a reduction in man-power of the order contemplated is imposed on theservices, we shall be unable adequately to fulfil all our commitments.24.   There appear to be two broad alternative courses (a) To forgo the return to civil employment of some 414,000 men and women,so that we may make a full contribution to the defeat of Japan and carry out all occupational tasks in Southern and South-eastern europe.(b) To scale down our commitments until a compromise can be reached with civil requirements.Conclusion.25. We conclude that, if we are adequately to undertake all necessarystrategical and political commitments a year after the defeat of Germany, so faras they can at present be foreseen, the minimum Service man- and woman-power required will be of the order of 3,404,500.(Signed) A.

ANNEX I.NAVAL MAN-POWER.1. A statement of the forces, other than Dominion ships, required for theJapanese war plus naval commitments in other theatres, is given in Appendix I..These figures make no allowance for casualties in ships except in the caseof submarines. A reduction of 20,000 officers and men has, however, been made mman-power requirements in anticipation that casualties in ships will be suffered.Dominion ships and ships on loan and manned by Dominions are given inAppendix II.2. The ships fully manned are sufficient only to provide for one strong coveror striking force in addition to those required to support one major amphibiousoperation, and for the security of sea communications.A possible distribution of forces is given in Appendix III. Those tentativelyallocated to the support of amphibious operations would be required in whateverarea we were developing operations. It will be seen that even allowing for thefull use of Dominion forces we have no surplus.*   3.   For European waters, naval forces are assessed on a minimum basis and in the event of an emergency reliance is placed on the timely diversion ofships working up, on passage, or from the Indian Ocean.The forces for Europe amount to no more than Home, North Sea and Baltic. Mediterranean.1 Battleship 4 Cruisers5 Cruisers 8 Destroyers16 Destroyers4. It has been assumed that it will be practicable to close all temporarybases at Home, in the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic. Only permanent naval bases, those required for training and development, and bases for mine clearancewill be maintained, and these will be on a reduced scale of complement.5. The savings which have thus been effected by reductions in bases, in anti-submarine escorts and defensive measures in the West, have, however, been largely absorbed in the expansion in the F.A.A., in aircraft carriers for their role in the Far Eastern war, in the provision of the Fleet Train and the develop-ment of new bases in the Eastern theatre.6. The maintenance personnel for the fleet in the Far East has been assessed at its lowest figure and cannot be reduced. As an example, the SpecialRepair Ratings (Dockyard) allowed only amount to the equivalent of one-thirdof the requirement of Chatham Dockyard. Whereas in the European Theatrethe full and well-established naval and civil maintenance resources were avail-able, in the Eastern Theatre maintenance facilities are largely non-existent andmust be improvised and maintained by the Navy alone both for the Fleeet andAmphibious Forces.7.   The amphibious forces have been calculated for a three divisional lift.8. On the above basis, naval man-power requirements for the year 1945 are estimated to be 760,000 men and 60,000 women.Of the 820,000 personnel mentioned approximately: 35-5% are required for the Fleet set out in Appendix I, landing ships and supporting Fleet Train, other than aircraft carriers and aircraft maintenance and repair ships.29-6% are required for F.A.A. aircraft carriers, aircraft maintenanceships and air stations.7   % for Combined Operational personnel, landing craft crews, &amp;c.7-3% for Royal Marines, including Special Service forces.2-9% D.E.M.S., including men at present provided by the army.16-5% for naval bases and base defences, Boom Defence and SpecialHeavy Repair Parties.   Operational bases and.port parties.Admiralty, &amp;c.1-2% for Coastal Forces.

To maintain one submarine in theEastern theatre, one additional submarine is needed to cover refit, working up, time on passage.Forty submarines are necessary for A/S and S/M training.

The possibility of reducing the number of minesweepers has been carefully considered.The saving in man-power would be small (6,000 for 150 vessels), and it would result in a delay of six to twelve months in clearing mines. This would gravely affect the resumption of fishingan:l trade.Appendix II to Annex I.Dominion-owned and Dominion-manned Ships.	B.A.N.	E.N.Z.N.	K.C.N.	B.I.N.	Total.

This includes relief carriers for assaults, A/S escort carriers and theatre ferrying.ANNEX II.BRITISH ARMY MAN-POWER.At Appendix I is a table giving a revised estimate of the deployment ofImperial forces twelve months after the defeat of Germany, and an estimate ofthe British man and woman-power required to implement it. The figure is1,768,500. Activity rates are at Appendix II. An analysis of the totals inparagraph 4 of the covering note is given at Appendix III.2.   This estimate takes account of the following : (a) Provision of forces to meet the additional requirements in Southern andSouth-Eastern Europe set out* by the P.H.P. Staff.(b) The maximum use of the armoured formations likely to be surplus toother requirements in substitution for infantry on occupational duties in Germany.(c) The employment of one Canadian formation on occupational duties inEurope. The agreement of the Canadian Government will benecessary.id) The employment of onet Allied formation (not American or Russian)on occupational duties in the British Zone in Germany. It is possiblethat this figure could in time be increased.(e) The employment of additional, enemy labour to release British service personnel. A provisional saving of 55,000 has been allowed for. to achieve this figure, a rather larger number of enemy personnel would* P.1I.P. (44) 47.f 0.0.S.

be required. Moreover, it may not be possible to retain all the Italianlabour at present used by the Army if the Italian Governmentis successful in the request it may be expected to make for the return of at least some of the Italian prisoners of war after the defeat ofGermany.(/) The reduction of A.A. Command to 30,000, which is one-sixth of its 1943strength. The Chiefs of Staff have given* general approval to thereduction of A.D.G.B. after the defeat of Germany, and theC.O.S.(A.A). Committee has been instructed to prepare a plan to implement this policy and to assess the man-power involved. Pendingthe result of this examination, 30,000 is the best estimate of thestrength to which A.A. Command could be reduced by the date underconsideration, but some further saving may prove practicable.(g) Allowance for non-effectives in the various theatres. These includeconvalescents, sick, wounded, men on leave, long service personnelbeing repatriated and troops in transit.Possibility of Further Reductions.3.   We examine below the possibility of effecting any further reductions.Germany (Item 2).4. Our main object in Europe, on the termination of the war there, will be toexercise effective control of Germany. The prospect of riot and disorder inGermany will be greater than in 1918, and it is reasonable to suppose that similar problems will arise, but in a more acute form. If we fail to exercise effective control the inevitable demand will be made to raise German forces for thispurpose. This would be difficult to refuse in the circumstances and we shouldhave the same chain of events as started in 1918/19. Germany has to be disarmedcompletely. We must, therefore, provide sufficient forces to maintain law andorder ourselves. We consider the forces proposed are barely sufficient for the task.They cannot with safety be reduced.Southern and South-Eastern Europe (Item 3.)5. If the occupation of certain areas of Southern and South-Eastern Europehas to be undertaken, we consider that the forces allowed for will still be requiredone year after the defeat of Germany and are the minimum necessary.! There is a risk that the forces required in North-East Italy might have to be increased; onthe other hand, it might be possible by this date to maintain the forces in Austriathrough Germany instead of through Italy. There is also a danger that the commitments we are likely to undertake in Greece immediately on the cessation of hostilities may not have been liquidated. On the other hand, if Bulgariacomes to terms with the Allies before the end of the war, military occupationmay not be required. It is difficult, therefore, to present firm assessments ofwhat our commitments may be. However, what we do or.fail to do in southern and South-Eastern Europe is of less consequence than control in Germany. Fromthe military point of view, therefore, if any cuts have to be made in occupationalforces w7e consider that those in South-East Europe should be cut before thosein Germany.India Command, S.E.A.C., and Pacific (Items 4, 5 and 6).6. Any reduction of these forces would be at the expense of the security ofIndia and of our effort against the Japanese and therefore is unacceptable, InC.O.S. (44) 408 (O) (Final) the Chiefs of Staff recommend that two of the five divisions required for the Pacific should be made available from India/S.E.A.C,provided the operational situation in *S.E.A.C. allows. We think that, even ifthese two divisions can be spared, they would probably have to be replaced from europe and that, therefore, for planning purposes, no saving in man-power can beanticipated.7. The figure of 100,000 for the Australian Base takes into accountAustralia^ critical man-power situation. Pending discussion of the problem itis necessary to assume that she will be unable to provide any personnel for operating British army base installations.* C.O.S. (44) 172nd Meeting (O), Item 2.f P.H.P. (44) 47.
Other Overseas Garrisons (Item 7).8. There is every possibility of disturbances in the Middle East, notably inPalestine, and it is essential that we should be fully prepared to meet this contingency. - Most of the purely British forces will be located in Arab countries and are none too strong for their potential commitments. Any cuts in localnative African forces would not result in worthwhile savings of British personnel.Imperial Reserve in the Middle East and M.E. Base (Items 8 and 9).9. The reserve in the Middle East is an important part of the british contribution to the Japanese war. It is also the only Imperial strategic reserve,apart from the small reserve which has a special task in Germany. It might,therefore, have to be drawn on to meet any major emergency such as might possiblyarise in Palestine or even S.E. Europe. From a military point of view, therefore,any cut might result in failure to play our full part in the defeat of Japan or todeal with an emergency in the Middle East, India or S. E. Europe.10. The Middle East base will be essential for the maintenance not only ofthe Imperial reserve, but also of forces in the Far East, garrisons in the middle east and any forces in S.E. Europe.General.11. Any appreciable cuts in the number of formations overseas would produce consequential savings in the figures for non-effectives.

ANNEX III.ROYAL AIR FORCE-MAN-POWER.In C.O.S. (44) 149 (O) the previous figure of 860,000 was calculated for anR.A.F. target force of 395 squadrons. It was estimated that this force would include 61 Canadian, South African and Allied Squadrons.2. In estimating the requirement for an R.A.F. target force of395 squadrons, it was assumed that a further 64 R.A.A.F. and R.N.Z.A.F.squadrons would be deployed in the Pacific. Thus the total British and Allieddeployment during&quot; this phase of the war was assessed at 459 squadrons. this figure is exclusive of certain small metropolitan garrison forces to be maintained by the Dominions and Allies. The deployment by theatres of this force is shownat Appendix.3. Since C.O.S. (44) 149 (0) was written, unofficial and exploratory conversations have been taking place with Canada, Australia and New Zealandconcerning their participation. From present indications these Dominionsanticipate providing a bigger contribution than was previously estimated. these increases amount to some 42 extra squadrons in all theatres, and. would afford areduction of a similar number of R.A.F.-manned squadrons. In view of the unofficial nature of the conversations with the Dominions, these figures cannotbe considered final, but they are the best estimate that can be made at the presenttime. We do not know what the state of equipment of these Dominion squadronswill be and, failing American allocations, it may be necessary to re-equip some ofthem with British types.4. The substitution in this way of 42 Dominion squadrons for R.A.F.-manned.squadrons will only effect the comparatively small saving of 16,000 menas the Dominions will provide personnel only&apos; for the actual squadrons. All thesecond and third line backing will continue to be provided by the R.A.F.5. It has been found impossible, at this stage, to work out in detail theorganisation and training which will be necessary in inactive theatres. In thismatter it is not practicable to turn to the past, as the pattern of the post-warair force will change vastly from pre-war days in the light of lessons learnedduring the war. Similarly in the Far East, until our strategy is finally settled,it will not be possible to work out exactly the required organisation for the airforces involved.6. Nevertheless, in an attempt to estimate R.A.F. man-power requirements as accurately as possible, some sweeping assumptions have been made and it hasbeen considered possible to make reductions in certain directions, e.g., the R.A.F.Regiment has been deleted entirely in the United Kingdom, and certain ancillary services such as balloons, radar, works services and signals have been reduced toa minimum.7. In reconsidering the figure of 860,000 in the light of present develop-ments it is thought possible to save some 28,000 personnel in addition to the saving of 16,000 referred to in paragraph 4. These cuts will reduce the R.A.F.man-power estimate to a total of 816,000, of which it is provisionally estimatedthat 100,000 would be women.Possibility of Further Reductions.8. The 459 squadrons estimated as required for this phase of the war aredistributed between theatres as folloy*s :  Squadrons.A ir Forces in Europe (Support of Occupational Forces)       26Air Forces in the United Kingdom (Defence, air striking Forces)      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        68Imperial Lines of Communication      ...      ...      ...        45War against Japan......      ,.....      ...      230World-wide Transport requirements   ...       ...       ...        90Total...............      459
Support of Army of Occupation.9. Air forces in Europe have been kept to a minimum for the support ofthe Army of occupation, and it is not considered possible to reduce below thefigure of 26 squadrons allotted for this task.Defence of United Kingdom and Air Striking Force.10. Our requirements have been based on retaining an efficient nucleus ofa defensive force in the United Kingdom. It is not considered acceptable toreduce further without seriously prejudicing our defensive organisation and ability to expand within a reasonable period, should the necessity arise.11. An adequate air striking force, composed mainly of heavy bombers, isrequired to maintain British influence in Europe and constitute the power behind the enforcement of surrender terms. A force of 20 heavy bomber squadronsbased in the United Kingdom and 10 squadrons in the Middle East has been allotted for this purpose.12. The comparatively low estimate of air forces necessary for the occupa-tion of Europe was made on the assumption that strong air forces would continueto be based in the United Kingdom and the Middle East to act as a permanentthreat. Furthermore, the military forces of occupation have also been calculated on the assumption that a considerable air threat would exist. It is consideredthat the minimum air forces have been allotted for these tasks.Imperial Lines of Communication.13. Air forces are necessary to assist in securing our Imperial L. of C.in general and our position in the Middle East in particular sothat we may prosecute the war against Japan without hindrance and protect our other vital interests, such as oil. It is not considered that forces allotted forthese tasks can be reduced without prejudicing our ability to protect this network of communications.The War against Japan.14. The strategy for the Japanese war is still undecided; we have therefore been unable to prepare detailed operational plans from which firm requirements for forces can be made. Nevertheless, it has been possible to estimate the airforces required for defensive purposes and to support the various alternativeoperations which may be undertaken in the Far East.15. It has been estimated that the British air contribution (including thatof the Dominions) for the war against Japan will be confined to the following : (i) Defensive air forces for the protection of bases in S.E A.C. and in India,and of shipping in the Bay of Bengal.(ii) Air forces for the support of operations in S.E.A.C.(iii) A small tactical air force to operate with the British and Dominionforces in the Pacific.(iv) Air forces for the protection of bases and shipping in British areas inthe Pacific.(v) A strategic bomber force to take part in the direct long-range attack on japan.16. Air forces allotted are sufficient only for the tasks outlined above and any appreciable reduction would result in forces inadequate for the purposes forwhich they are intended.World-Wide Transport Requirements.17. The total number of British and Allied Squadrons planned for thisstage of the war is 90, or 1,800 aircraft.18. These squadrons, which will be deployed in the light of the strategicsituation, are required for the following tasks : (i) For transporting airborne forces in Europe, the Middle East and inthe war against Japan.(ii) For supply and maintenance of land and air forces by air.(iii) To meet requirements on the Transatlantic route.(iv) To cover long-distance air transport throughout the world, includingour main trunk routes to the operational theatres in the Far East.

The sum total of 1,800 aircraft allowed for falls short of the GeneralStaff estimate for army requirements alone.Conclusions.20. In order to meet all British commitments during the Japanese &quot;Warphase, Air Forces of the order of 459 squadrons will be required. It is at present estimated that, of this total force, 282 squadrons will be R..A.F. proper,10 squadrons Indian Air Force, and the balance of 167 squadrons will beDominion and Allied.21. After making allowance for reductions in inactive theatres wherever possible, it is estimated that man-power requirements for the R.A.F. force of282 squadrons will be 716,000 men and 100,000 women.22. Any further substantial reduction in man-power will impose a cut in first-line strength, and we shall be unable adequately to fulfil our commitments
