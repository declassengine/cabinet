COPY NO.j^L10th July, 19jj bW.P. qiii.&apos;) 385C A B IFLYING B0E3S  - EVACUATION INTO PROTECTED AREAS.24Q r n.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the liinist er_____        of Home Security.____The Cabinet at its meeting on the 7th instant invited me,  in consultation with the Secretary of State for War,  theSecretary of   State for Scotland and the Llinister of Health, to .consider whether administrative arrangements could be made toallow persons not falling within the permitted classes to enterand remain in protected areas if they came from areas liable toattack from flying bombs, on the understanding that no public announcement would be made of these relaxations.2. Even before this decision;  steps had been taken toprevent the police in England and Wales from expelling orprosecuting women,  children, homeless persons and aged personswho illegally entered protected areas from London, since it was felt that the expulsion or prosecution of such persons in presentcircumstances would be resented by public opinion and would giverise to adverse comment by the courts.      Similar steps woretaken in Scotland.      The police were told on the ij.th July thathe publicity should be given to this provisional relaxation butthat persons of the classes referred to who enquired about entryshould be given a reply which would not discourage theirjourney.      On the 6th July, the police in the protected areaswest of Southampton were further instructed not to raise any objection to the entry into those areas of organised parties, of school children brought under the auspices of the Ministry ofHealth as part  of the evacuation plan.3. It was explained to the police that theseadministrative arrangements were provisional only and that itwas hoped that the position would be clarified at an early date.h. The extension of these administrative arrangements soas to cover other classes of persons or the prolongation of theexisting arrangements is bound to give rise to very great difficulties;(l)    Only law breakers are benefiting from theadministrative concessions.      It was always recognised thatthere was net sufficient man power to enforce the ban on access to protected areas and that reliance would have to be placed onthe law-abiding habits- of the population.      What is happening isthat the public are being encouraged to break the  law,  raid ifever it became necessary to create further protected areas thepublic would not treat the orders seriously and they would notaccordingly be enforced.A feeling of resentment will be created when, as is inevitable, persons who themselves obey the law observe thatoth^r persons are allowed te break the law with impunity.      The

public tolerate restrictions cheerfully only if they believe that the lav/ is the same for ell and is impartiallyadii n i s t e r e &amp;.(3)    There is a risk that to encourage the police towink at breaches of the lew may give scope for corruption.(If.)    The concessions cannot long be concealed.      Thepress will soon learn that unauthorised persons are entering the protected areas and will nc doubt publish.that information.Questions are already on the Order Paper for answer by theSecretary of State for War on Tuesday,  asking that additionalclasses of persons should be allowed to enter the protectedareas,  and,  unless some new policy is adopted,  it will have tobe stated in Parliament in reply that the police are dealingsympathetically with the cases of persons who enter protectedareas illegally.      If so, there will probably be great pressure on the Government tc state what  classes of personsthe police have been instructed to treat leniently, and it will no doubt be urged that it would bo much better to formulateadditional categories of persons permitted to enter protectedareas.5- Per these reasons it seems to bo inevitable thatsome public announcement should bo made in reply to theQuestions in Parliament  on Tuesday next making it clear that,whilo the ban on the protected areas must be ,retained for operational reasons,  the use of the flying bomb has created a new situation and the Government have accordingly decidedto allow persons in the &quot;priority classes&quot; from London andcertain other cvacuablc areas of Southern England to enterprotected areas for the purpose of taking up residence-,  ifthey are evacuated under the Government Evacuation Scheme orhold an evacuation certificate from a local authority under that Scheme.6. The priority classes arc:-1)    Children2.)    mothers with childrenj?)    Expectant mothersk)    Aged,  infirm,  invalid and blind persons of both soxes.The Government Evacuation Scheme provides for theevacuation in organised parties of persons in the first three classes;    also for the issue by local authorities of free travel vouchers and billeting certificates to persons in anyor the four classes who have relatives or friends in the saferareas with whom they can reside.7. I have- ascertained through Sir Findlater Stewartthat S.H.A.E.P.fs views are  that the Cover Plan is of vitalimportance to current operations.      They are of the opinion;that a public announcement in the terms suggested above nighthave far-reaching effects on the success of the Cover Plan,it^is appreciated that the difficulties of administrativelyeffecting further relaxations to the visitors&apos; ban arc verygreat,  and that the method of administrative relaxation may be unfair on certain individuals, but it is suggested that anyuniairnoss is outweighed by the consideration that theimpairment  of the Cover Plan might have serious consequences.

S.H.A.E.F. would prefer that no public announcement shouldbo niadCj  and would make the concession only on the strongesthumanitarian grounds and ii relief for the priority classescannot be obtained in any other way.S. The Secretary of State for War;.  the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the hinistor of Health are inagreement with the proposals made by me in paragraphs 5and 6.H.H.HOiut] OFFICE.: &apos;10th July,   19kh.
