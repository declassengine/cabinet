TOP SECRET.OIL STATEMENT.WE do not ask for any trading advantages for Britain.2. What we seek, on behalf of a nation ravaged by war, is military andeconomic security. :  -&quot;3. We have a complete desire to promote orderly development of the oil industry. We are confident that this object will be realised in a manner satis-factory to all.4. But the issue of security in our existence as a nation cannot be a secondary consideration.   It must come first.5. The war has taught our people that oil is essential for the operation or armies, navies, air forces and robot warfare. Oil is more important in wagingwar than steel.6. The power to defend ourselves is altogether destroyed if our people donot possess resources in oil available at all times.7. Unless Britain is assured of oil, she is not assured of life. Unless britain is assured of oil, she is unable to take part in safeguarding the future peace ofthe world.8. The supplies of oil under our control must conform to the scale of our security requirements on land, sea and in the air.9. These requirements are not confined to the defence of the British Islesand the sea communications leading to them. We are bound equally to defend the Dominions and the Crown Colonies.10. In the course of this war we have faced total destruction. We havebeen saved by a narrow margin. The experience of 1940 is one which we will never forget. And on that account, the issue of military security has become a passion of the people, altogether over-ruling any considerations of a commercialcharacter.11. When we mention another factor, economic security, we are concerned only with our ability to live.12. Our economic structure, as it existed before the war, has been destroyed. We have suffered an economic revolution as complete and as swiftas any in history.13. Before the war we were able to pay for  200 million of imported rawmaterials and foodstuffs from the proceeds of our investments abroad. our industries depended on the first.  Our cupboard on the second.14. We have sold more than  1,000 million of overseas assets. We have incurred overseas liabilities which may amount to  3,000 million before thewar is finished.15. We must, by one method or another, supply our homes with food andour factories with raw materials.16. And, whatever else the future may bring, we will not any longer have 200 million of foreign exchange put into our hands, in the form of dividends,to be used for the purchase of the necessities of life.17. Our foreign exchange position may be very difficult, especially in theyears of adjustment. The consequences may be very serious for many countrieswhich have found in us a good market.18. And it may well be a matter of the highest importance to us to supplya greater proportion of our oil requirements in sterling oil. At present, only halfof United Kingdom and &quot; Empire &quot; requirements are supplied in sterling oil.19.   This is the sense in which we use the term, economic security.[27829] &apos;
20. With these conditions of military and economic security in mind, we propose to include in the document words establishing that its provisions mustnecessarily be subject to considerations of military security, and providing us with the liberty to seek an enlargement of the production of sterling oil, should this become necessary for reasons of our national security, either military or economic.21. It is our intention for the purpose of sustaining our economic security to retain the right to supply British and Colonial consumption from sterling oil resources.22. It is our understanding that the Memorandum in no manner impairs-our right to apply protection by tariff or quota to British and Colonial oil,provided that the fiscal methods shall be in conformity with any international arrangements that may be in force.23. Finally, we ask the United States to put on record that theMemorandum covers our full pre-emptive rights under the Kuwait and similaragreements and protects our existing rights as to development of resources,location of reserves, &amp;c.(Signed) BEAVERBROOK.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1, iVlth July, 1944.
