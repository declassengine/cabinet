(44) 351.27th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.SHIPMENT OF FOODGEAINS TO INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.1. My colleagues may like to know the developments which have taken place since the War Cabinet last considered this matter on the 28th April, 1944(W.M. (44) 59th Conclusions).2. A negative reply having been received from President Roosevelt, thePrime Minister directed that the matter should again be considered in the IndianPoodgrains Committee. The Committee agreed that there was no possibility of finding further shipping for imports of food grains to India unless this could befound out of shipping already allocated, for military purposes. The matter wasthen referred to the Chiefs of Staff, who reported to the Prime Minister on the22nd June that they considered that the provision of wheat for India is a militaryrequirement of great strategical importance. Apart from political considera-tions, the military consequences of a second disastrous famine in India would be most serious in its effect on the morale of the Indian Army and on the securityof India as a base for operations in Burma and China. As no other source oftonnage was available, the Chiefs of Staff recommended, that. 25 sailings from military maintenance programmes over the next three months should be cancelledand that the Minister of War Transport should be asked to arrange for the shipment of an additional 200,000 tons of wheat from Australia to India duringthe third quarter of 1944. They also recommended that the War Office, inconsultation with the other Service Departments, should review the positionduring the first fortnight in August and again during the first fortnight inNovember.3. The Prime Minister approved action being taken in accordance with theChiefs of Staffs recommendations,, and with the concurrence of the Minister ofWar Transport and the War Office, I have communicated the decision to theViceroy. The Viceroy has replied that although the decision is not entirely satisfactory from his point of view he will do his best. I hope, therefore, that,for the time being at any rate, this critical situation has been eased.L. S. A.India Office, 27th June, 1944.[27719]
