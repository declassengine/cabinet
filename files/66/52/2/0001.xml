The meeting, which they had come to attend, took place duringthe first fortnight of May.2. The formal opening meeting was held on the 1st May; the speechesdelivered at it by the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions,the Indian representatives and the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia wereafterwards published in the press. The closing meeting was held on the16th May; the speeches delivered at it and the Declaration which the five PrimeMinisters signed were also published.3. At the fourteen business meetings which were held between the 2ndand the 15th May, the following subjects were discussed : the immediate militarysituation, the conduct of the war against Japan, foreign affairs, monetary and commercial policy, colonial policy, post-war shipping policy, civil aviation,post-war employment plans, migration, the post-war world settlement, andco-operation within the British Commonwealth, in that order.4. Members of the United Kingdom War Cabinet and a number of other united Kingdom Ministers attended the formal opening and closing meetings,at which the Dominion Prime Ministers were accompanied by the DominionHigh Commissioners and their senior service and civil advisers. Attendancesat the other meetings were limited as far as possible. The Indian representatives and the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia were invited to attend when matters specially affecting them were discussed.5. During their stay, the Dominion Prime Ministers, the Indian Represen-tatives and the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia attended a number of meetings of the United Kingdom War Cabinet. In company with the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom they visited forces in the South of England,besides making individual visits to stations occupied by the forces of the variousDominions.6. The Prime Minister of Canada addressed members of both Houses ofParliament on the 11th May.

8. Mr. Mackenzie King returned to Canada by air on the 20th May, andMr. Curtin set off on his return journey via Canada on the 29th May, also by air.Mr. Fraser and Field-Marshal Smuts were still in the United Kingdom at theend of the month.9. It was universally agreed, as the Dominion Prime Ministers made clear in their speeches at the formal closing meeting on the 16th May, that the meeting was extremely successful. The atmosphere in which the discussions were heldwas strikingly friendly and there was a full and frank exchange of views on allthe subjects discussed.CANADA.10. All sections of the press have shown remarkable unity and cordiality inwelcoming Mr. Mackenzie King on his return from London, and it is agreed thatthe Prime Minister has &quot; discharged his duties with distinction and with an authority that has commanded world-wide respect.&quot;11. Comment in Conservative papers on the Declaration issued on the con-clusion of the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference has tended to the expression ofdisappointment that no definite plans for Empire consolidation were made known.Of the papers which have applauded the declaration, the Winnipeg Free Pressacclaims it as a complete answer to those who feared the Halifax &quot; Titantheory.&apos;&apos;12. Parliament has been relatively quiet except for the controversy whichhas flared up again over conscription. The English press has expressed disgustat the resolution passed by the Quebec Assembly opposing oversea conscriptionand at the&apos; accusation that the Minister of Defence, Colonel Ralston, was attempt-ing to coerce Home Defence units into service overseas. The Minister vigorouslydefended his recruiting methods and said that the use of the word &quot;coerce &quot; wasnot only unauthorised but totally unjustified.13. -Mr. Bracken, the leader of the Progressive Conservative party, hasmade a speech against State socialism, which appeared to him &apos;&apos; as the last resortof a bewildered and impoverished people who are prepared to sacrifice their political liberty and their freedom of opportunity to buy security on a lower levelof subsistence.&quot;14. There is reason to think that the Liberal party leaders of Quebec mayhave gone back on their decision not to have an election before September and arenow considering a provincial general election immediately after the end of thepresent session. The Quebec Legislature voted overwhelmingly in favour of a motion &quot; reaffirming unyielding disapproval of overseas conscription.&quot;15. The Saskatchewan Legislature was dissolved and a provincial generalelection fixed for the 15th June. (The election has resulted in an overwhelmingvictory for the C.C.F. party.)16. After some stir had been raised by the first fresh reports that theUnited Kingdom had &quot; abandoned &quot; the Canadian draft Convention on Post-War Civil Aviation, the Minister of Munitions and Supply, Mr. Hull,to the House that the Canadian Convention was the first attempt by any nation to submit a detailed plan for the regulation of post-war aviation, but was merelyintended as a draft for discussion. He expressed gratification that the Canadianproposals had received such widespread study.17. A warm welcome was extended to Mr. Curtin when he arrived on his visit to Canada when on return from London.18.   The Archbishop of York has also paid a visit to Canada.19. Mr. J. Scott MacDonald, Counsellor of the Department of external affairs, has been appointed High Commissioner for Canada in Newfoundland.20. The first Mexican Ambassador, Dr. Francisco del Rio Y Canedo, andthe Peruvian Minister, Senor Emilio Orlez De Zavallos, have arrived in Canada.The new Soviet Ambassador, M. Zarubian, is expected shortly.Service A activities.21. H.M.C. Frigate Valley field was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat early on the 7th 40 miles S.E. of Cape Race; H.M.C.S. Giffard picked up 38 survivors.
22. The 31st Minesweeping Flotilla completed clearance of a dangerousarea off Devonshire on the 24th; this was the first area in Home Waters to be cleared by a minesweeping flotilla of the Koyal Canadian Navy.23. A Canadian Joint Staff Mission is now established in London to actas a link with the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff and with the Supreme AlliedCommanders. The members of this Mission will have access to United KingdomChiefs of Staff and will have contact on day-to-day liaison matters with theSupreme Commanders. Military matters of high policy will continue to be dealtwith through the Combined Chiefs of Staff. The members of the Canadian joint staff Mission are : &apos;Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles, Head of the Canadian Naval Mission and.Senior Canadian Flag Officer Overseas;Lt.-General  Kenneth  Stuart,   Chief of   Staff,   Canadian  MilitaryHeadquarters, London; andAir Marshal L. S. Breadner, Air Officer Commander-in-Chief, royal canadian Air Force Overseas.24. The regrouping of Allied Armies in Italy prior to the launching ofGeneral Alexander&apos;s offensive on the night of the 11th May, involved transferring the Canadian Corps from the Adriatic sector to the left of the Eighth Army.The Germans were evidently unaware of this move for some days and. in the early part of the month leaflets addressed to Canadians were still being distributedover a sector then held by Indian troops.25. On the 18th May after many attempts and much bitter fighting Cassinoand Monastery Hill were captured by United Kingdom and Polish troopsrespectively and south of them Canadian troops were advancing towards theHitler Line; the next day they were reported in contact with the line east and north-east of Pontecorvo, where they met stiff resistance. It was now evidentthat this stretch between Aquino and Pontecorvo was the strongest part of theHitler Line and for the next few days no substantial progress in this sector wasmade although the Canadians maintained close contact with the Germans intheir prepared defences while awaiting orders for General Alexander&apos;s concertedattack both on the Main Front and from the Anzio Bridgehead. This attackstarted on the morning of the 23rd and in little more than 24 hours the CanadianCorps had broken the Hitler Line between Aquino and Pontecorvo. By the afternoon of the 24th their leading armoured elements were on the eastern banks of the Melfa, a stream about half-way between Pontecorvo and Ceprano. On the25th United States patrols from the main front joined up near Littoria withpatrols from the bridgehead, and a continuous front was established. canadian troops captured Ceprano on the 27th and by the 31st, in company with UnitedKingdom troops, they were entering Frosinone.26. Activities of R.C.A.F. Heavy Bomber Squadrons again reached a newrecord in May with the largest number of sorties flown and the greatest weight of bombs dropped. Objectives were mainly goods yards and military targets such asrailway centres, airfields and coastal defences around the area in Normandyselected for our landings and in other parts of the occupied countries. three german cities, Dortmund, Aachen and Duisburg, were attacked. Operationalsorties totalled 1,869 and hours flown on operations reached nearly 8,000. Thirty-six aircraft failed to return from these operations.27. There was also a very marked increase in the activities of R.C.A.F.squadrons of the 2nd Tactical Air Force. 4,054 operational sorties were flowntotalling nearly 6,500 hours; 22 aircraft are missing from these operations.28. Canadian squadrons in the Air Defence of Great Britain flew 899operational sorties totalling 1,936 hours. No. 418 Mosquito Night IntruderSquadron again registered the largest number of successes with 35^ german aircraft destroyed, one probably destroyed and 14 damaged for the loss of threeMosquitoes.29. Coastal Command R.C.A.F. aircraft flew 286 operational sortiestotalling 2,100 hours; two aircraft were missing. Among the successes reported by these squadrons were one German destroyer and four escorting minesweepersset on fire, a merchant vessel set on fire and one U-boat and. four small coastal vesselsclaimed sunk; several other small craft were claimed as damaged.[27722] b 2
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.30. Mr. Curtin arrived in Ottawa on the evening of the 30th May. Heattended various social functions, including a dinner given by the canadian government, and he was present at a meeting of the War Committee of theCabinet. When Mr. Curtin addressed a joint session of the Senate and Houseof Commons, he gave a review of the part Australia was playing in the war.31. In announcing the Declaration made at the end of the Prime Ministers&apos;Conference, the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Forde, said &apos;&apos; this history-making and inspiring document will be hailed by people throughout the Empire as a token of the victory which is foreseen by the Prime Ministers. The people ofAustralia will welcome the Declaration as an incentive to carry on the war effort with every ounce of their energy.&quot;32. The Official Labour Party led by the Premier, Mr. McKell, has been returned to power at the New- South Wales Election, where the state of the partiesis now: Official Labour 51, Democrats 11, Country Party 10, Independents 4,Lang Labour 2.33. Mr. Forde, the Acting Prime Minister, has announced that Australiaintends to embark on a positive immigration policy immediately after the war,and will particularly seek British Ex-Servicemen and selected children from theUnited Kingdom and Europe. The volume will be largely controlled by australia^ employment capacity, housing facilities, and the rehabilitation of her own people now in the services and in war industry. &apos;&apos; The Government believethat if it wins the referendum for greater Commonwealth powers, work will beavailable for thousands besides Australians.&quot;34. The New South Wales full Court has declared void the regulation underwhich the Manpower Directorate have been directing persons to employment with private employers. The Court unanimously held that the regulation meantindustrial conscription beyond legal powers. Special leave to appeal against thedecision has been granted by the full High Court. The Minister for Labour and national Service said that pending the appeal to the High Court, the ManpowerDirectorate would continue to issue direction notices where necessary.35. Considerable dissatisfaction with the food position continues to beevident, and very great prominence was given to a dispute between the leader of the New South Wales Country Party and the Minister for Agriculture in whichthe former alleged that, owing to the Federal Government&apos;s inefficiency andindustrial anarchy, rationing in his State had not produced one extra ounce of meat for Britain, while the latter denied there was any decline in production.The Premier of Victoria has asked the Agent-General for a full report on theUnited Kingdom&apos;s method of increasing food production. Reaction to the news of the decreased butter ration is that, while no one objects to sacrifices for Britain,need for further reduction is due to the Governments muddling.36. Sir Frederick Eggleston, the Commonwealth Minister to China, has arrived on leave after 2^ years&apos; service in Chungking. In a speech on arrival, he emphasised the necessity for Australia to become more &apos;&apos; China-minded &apos;&apos; andthe opportunities that await Australian enterprise in the development andindustrialisation of China.Service A activities.37.   H.M. Australian Minesweeper Parkes was commissioned on the 25th.38. Australian Escort Vessels bombarded Karker Islands off the new guinea coast north-east of Alexishaf en on the 12th and 13th, destroying buildings,gun positions and munition dumps.39. The Australian-manned H.M. Destroyers Nepal, Napier and Quiberontook part in operations of Eastern Fleet against Sourabaya.40. By the 20th May 17,404 Army personnel had been discharged sincethe 1st November in accordance with the&quot;Governments policy to release men forrural industry; progress in this scheme is therefore ahead of schedule.
NEW ZEALAND.41. Comment on the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference has generally beenapproving, but there is some regret that the Declaration was not more specificwith regard to the principles of foreign policy or on information on the world organisation to maintain peace.42. Mr. Fraser&apos;s speech on immigration was fully reported. The pressemphasised the fact that Great Britain cannot be the source of many immigrants,and several papers support the attitude of Australia in being prepared to acceptsuitable types other than British.43. The Municipal Elections were held on the 27th May when the OfficialLabour party made an attempt to secure control of local bodies, but they weredecisively defeated by Opposition candidates. This defeat may be due partly to growing distrust shown by the Labour rank and file for those who control the party machine and partly to the fact that electors were prepared to put theirtrust in existing experienced civic administrators.44. The announcement of the appointment of a post-war planning organisa-tion has met with some criticism as it is feared that any one organisation may become over-powerful and bureaucratic. This was answered by the Acting PrimeMinisters statement that a committee on various reconstruction activities wouldbe formed, consisting of ^Government Officers and representatives outside theorganisation. When making his statement the Acting Prime Minister also saidthat it was the Government^ policy to lift controls as soon as the opportunityarose.45. The rationing of meat has become more strict and now includes mincedand other small meats. There has been wide criticism on the failure of thescheme to effect any great saving of meat, owing to plentiful offals and otherunrationed meat, and to the action of farmers and country people who, having no use for their coupons, give them to others.Service Activities.46. H.M.N.Z.S. Gfirribia is operating under the Admiralty with the EasternEleet. H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles has completed to full complement and will shortlyleave Dockyard in. United Kingdom for working-up. H.M.N.Z.S. Leander isstill refitting and rearming in the United States.47. H.M.N.Z.S. arab is, a new Corvette, has left Great Britain for NewZealand.48. The 80th and 81st Motor Launch Flotillas, comprising 12 fair miles, arenow based at Russell Islands, in the Solomon Islands, under the operational control of the Commander, South Pacific. 15 Minesweeping Trawlers, mostlyfitted for anti-submarine duties, and 16 harbour defence motor launches are operating at Auckland and Wellington. Two anti-submarine minesweepingtrawlers are stationed at Lyttleton.49.   Seven of the &quot; Castle &quot; type anti-submarine minesweeping vessels built in New Zealand are now in service.50. The general advance on the Western sector of the main front in Italy,as a result of General Alexander^1 co-ordinated offensive on the 23rd May,involved the New Zealand Division north of Monte Cairo. On the 28th theycaptured Atina and continued their advance north-westwards up the road towardsSora, which they were approaching on the last day of the month.51.   A Fiji Docks Company consisting of 400 all ranks which was formedon the 7th March has now embarked for service overseas.52. Air Commodore A. de T. Nevill, C.B.E., has been appointed Vice-Chiefof the Air Staff and becomes a member of the Air Board in place of AirCommodore G. T. Jarman, D.S.O., D.F.C., who retains the post of Deputy-Chiefof the Air Staff.53. The movement of R.N.Z.A.F. Fighter and Torpedo-bomber fighter squadrons to the forward area in the Pacific has been cancelled. The futureemployment of R.N.Z.A.F. Squadrons is under discussion with the United states authorities.
UNION OF SOUTH AFEICA.54. The South African press has summarised fully Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;saddress to members of both Houses of Parliament and acclaimed Mr. mackenzie king for dispelling the belief that the Conference would reveal deep-seatedconstitutional differences within the Commonwealth. Opposition papers arebitter in their attack on the system of Empire conferences, declaring that decisions taken in secret at these conferences are regarded as binding. Friend says that&quot; although these decisions for a post-war world may bind Smuts and his party,when South Africa, after the war, gets rid of them, it will not consider these decisions binding on herself.&quot;55. Much interest has centred around the Wakkerstroom by-election heldon the 10th May. In the general election of July last, the late Minister of Agri-culture, Col. Collins, held the seat for the Government by a majority of 551 votes,and although it was realised for some time that the result would be a close one, itwas thought that the Government candidate would manage to retain the seatThe Nationalist Party, however, defeated the Government by 221 votes. Theywere helped by the difficulties which confront a Government Party with a large majority in a by-election campaign, i.e., many electors feel they can safely vote against the Government candidate on local issues without fear of dismissing theadministration from office. Factors also in their favour were the absence fromthe country of about 300 soldiers who voted in the last general election and theexistence in the constituency of a large block of persons of German descent whocast their votes for the Nationalist Party on this occasion as they felt a grievanceby the recent ban imposed by the Minister of Justice on their attendance at public meetings. - The result has been greeted by the Nationalists with the utmostjubilation. The Party is now preparing to fight the October municipal elections,especially on the Rand and in Pretoria, on political lines, and the Labour Party inthe larger towns is entering into a united front with Communist Party to formworkers&apos; civic leagues with the same object.56. There has been renewed interest by the Nationalist Party in the TradeUnion Movement. The Labour Party&apos;s official bulletin has declared that a carefully planned campaign is being conducted among workers of the Rand, withthe aim of gaining control of the South African Trade Union Movement. Behindthis campaign are selected members of the Nationalist Party, the Broederbond,the Ossewa Brandwag, and other Afrikaans organisations.57. Having helped the Nationalist candidate at Wakkerstroom there are indications that Mr. Pirow&apos;s &quot;New Order&quot; is making serious efforts towardsreconciliation, and it is maintaining its relations with the Ossewa Brandwag.58. After three years of investigation of the existing system of provincialfinance, the Provincial Finance Resources Committee has published its report.The main points are that there have been conspicuous shortcomings in theProvinces&apos; handling of functions assigned to them by Acts of the Union, and thatcertain responsibilities, such as non-European education, have been neglected.59. To the Soldiers Charter announced recently has been added two morereports. One is the modified Social Security drafted by a Parliamentary SelectCommittee, and the other ic the Report for the period June 1940 to December 1943of the Nutrition Council on measures to combat malnutrition. The next step towards creating machinery to carry out the Government&apos;s Demobilisation plan will be taken shortly when regional conferences will be held at Johannesburg,Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban and Cape Town, to form the demobilisation and Discharged Soldiers&apos; Committees, which will become the returned soldiers&apos;own organisations to deal on the spot with his difficulties.60. There is increasing agitation among Indians in Durban against the compromise agreement involving the withdrawal of the Pegging Act and substitu-tion of the Licensing Board to control occupation of property. The CommunistParty is taking a prominent part in organisation of meetings of protest and a prominent member of the Natal Indian Congress has provoked prosecution underthe Pegging Act as a protest against delay in implementing the provisions of theagreement.Service A activities.61.   The 6th South African Armoured Division entered the Italian theatrein the central part of the front during the early part of the month.
EIRE.62. The news from Eire during May was largely devoted to the--GeneralElection, which arose from the defeat of Mr. de Valera&apos;s Government in the Dailon the 9th May by one vote on the second reading of the Transport Bill. this bill proposed the establishment of a  20 million combine to absorb the GreatSouthern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company. There had been considerable uneasiness for some time, expressed both publicly and privately,arising from a suggestion that there had been a leakage of information which had enabled speculators to make large sums by investing in railway shares. An officialenquiry was being held into these allegations, and the vote defeating the Govern-ment was the outcome of a motion tabled by the Opposition asking the Governmentto postpone the Bill pending the outcome of this enquiry.63. The Opposition parties were all agreed in deploring the Government&apos;decision to hold a General Election. Mr. de Valera was unmoved by theseprotests, saying that the Government had made it clear that if they were defeatedon the second reading of the Bill they could not carry on. It is clear that whereasFianna Fail, the Government party, were ready in organisation and finance forthe snap election, none of the Opposition parties was.64. The election campaign was conducted amidst considerable public apathy,since the only issues raised were domestic. Neutrality was not an issue, and inthe course of an election speech Mr. de Valera said on this question that theGovernment had decided on the policy of neutrality, and had obtained the supportof all other parties with a few individual exceptions. There had been no suggestion made to him by other parties that they would adopt a different policyif there were a Coalition Government. Nevertheless Mr. de Valera was helpedin his campaign by the belief that his support of neutrality was more whole-hearted than that of his opponents, and also by his recent rejection of the UnitedStates Note on the subject of German and Japanese representatives in Dublin.65. In a letter sent to each Party Chairman of Fianna Fail, Mr. de Valerasaid that the Election was due to the fact that the Government had not rested onany secure majority in the Dail. The issue was as in 1933 and 1938, the provisionof a strong, stable National Government. Only a Government reasonably assured of a majority could meet crises as they occurred, or plan effectively in theknowledge that their plans could be carried through. Only such a Governmentcould command respect, either at home or abroad. To secure such a Governmentwould require the most earnest efforts of the supporters of Fianna Fail, so thatthe electorate might be fully informed of what was at stake. In factMr. de Valera succeeded in making the question of one party or coalition govern-ment the main issue in the election.66. The list of nominations showed that Mr. de Valera&apos;s Party alone had placed enough candidates in the field to give them a chance of obtaining an overallmajority in the Dail. The final result was as follows : Fianna Fail 76, FineGael 30, Farmers 11, Independents 9, Labour 8, National Labour 4; Fianna Failmajority over all other parties 14. The principal features of the results were thegains of Fianna Fail and the heavy losses of the now divided Labour Party. Itis, however, interesting to note that, although Fianna Fail secured 55 per cent,of the seats in the new Dail, they only obtained 49 per cent, of the votes recorded.Polling was relatively light, owing to the absence overseas of men serving in military or civilian jobs in Great Britain, to the fact that the election was foughton an old register and to the shortage of transport. These factors, on the whole,favoured Fianna Fail.67. Before the dissolution of the Dail, the Minister of Finance. Mr. 0&apos;Kelly,had presented the Budget. He announced that this year there would be no freshtaxation. The Budget was for  49,967,000, against which was estimated arevenue of  45,635,000, leaving a gap of  4,354,000 to be found by borrowing orotherwise. Income Tax revenue was expected to reach a new record and produce 11,510,000 and Super Tax  570,000. Expenditure on Supply Services was increased by  4,500,000.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.68. In the general internal situation, and, in the attitude of public opiniontowards the war, there is no significant change to report.69. Mr. Gandhi was set at liberty unconditionally on the 6th May. his release was ordered for no political motive, but solely on account of the state ofhis health, about which the Government of India had for some days been receivingalarming medical reports by both official and private specialists. The decisionto set him at liberty was universally acclaimed, but the Government of India&apos;transaction was inevitably misinterpreted in certain quarters as the first step in anattempt to end the political deadlock and a flood of speculation was let loose,coupled with renewed demands for the release of the Congress leaders. what mr. Gandhi will say or do is still uncertain; in the meanwhile he has been takingstock of the general situation and recuperating from his illness.70. One other development, of less but sufficiently noteworthy importance,was the decision of the Moslem League Committee of Action at the end of themonth to expel the Punjab Premier from the Moslem League. This was the consequence of Mr. Jinnah&apos;s failure, reported last month, to induce the Premierto drop the &quot; Unionist &quot; label and bring his Ministry into subjection to the will of the Moslem League. The expulsion of the Premier from the League will undoubtedly have an unsettling effect on Provincial politics in the Punjab, butit is too early to say whether Mr. Jinnah&apos;s influence will gain at the expense ofthe Premier&apos;s authority.External and Frontier Relations.71. &apos; Afghanistan. At the end of the month the Afghan government appeared to have the situation in the Southern Province well in hand: Mazrak,the tribal leader who was mainly responsible for the trouble, was reported tohave been deserted by the main body of his followers and to have fled across the border into British tribal territory. The Afghan Government have expressedthe hope that the Government of India may be able to secure his arrest. It isbelieved, in some circles in Kabul that the dissident elements in the southern province have been encouraged in their opposition to the Central government by the Japanese Legation.A test of a Tiger Moth aircraft was arranged in Kabul at the end of themonth at the request of the Afghan Government. If the test is satisfactory, theAfghan Government may wish to purchase about six Tiger Moths for training purposes.72. North-West Frontier. The number of tribesmen who sought to take part in the disturbances on the Afghan side of the frontier was very small.The following of the Faqir of Ipi in Central Waziristan dispersed aboutthe middle of the month and the Faqir&apos;s own whereabouts have since beenunknown. It is possible that the Faqir was embarrassed by the rising of the tribesmen in the Southern Province against the Afghan Government with whom it appears that he does not wish to be on bad terms.Troops engaged on the protection of the road running north from Razmakwere attacked by tribesmen on the 16th May and suffered some casualties.Generally the situation on the Frontier remained quiet.73. Tibet. His Majesty&apos;s Government have approved the Government ofIndia&apos;s proposal to send Sir Basil Gould on a visit to Lhasa this summer, inthe course of which he will discuss with the Tibetan Government the questionsof their attitude towards Chinese Propaganda and of the steps now being takenby the Government of India to establish their position along the McMahon Line.The new Chinese Representative with the Tibetan Government, who arrived in India en route to Lhasa recently, brought with him a staff of seven personsinstead of the four for whom the Government of India had agreed to the issueof transit visas. The Government of India proposed to urge the TibetanGovernment to admit the additional members of the party but to advise themto oppose any proposal, such as is understood to be contemplated, to increasethe strength of the Chinese Mission in Tibet still further.
74. Sinkiang. No further trouble on the Outer Mongolia Border was reported. In Kashgar increased interest in air raid precautions on the partof the local authorities under instructions from the Central Government wasattributed to apprehension of aggression by the Soviet Government and not tothe possibility of air raids by the Japanese.75. Persian Gulf. The air offensive against German-occupied europe and the operations in Italy have been the subject of much public interest.At the end of April the Sheikh of Koweit granted the unconditional releaseof all political prisoners in his State. Most of these had been arrested in con-nection with certain agitations against the Sheikh&apos;s rule in 1938 and 1939, andtheir release was evidence of the Sheikh&apos;s increased confidence in his own position.Messrs. Petroleum Concessions, Limited (a British company and a subsidiaryof the Iraq Petroleum Company) notified the Sultan of Muscat of their intentionto take up oil concessions covering the whole of the Sultan&apos;s territory (exceptGwadur on the Baluchistan Coast) under the option clause of their present agreement.Economic.76. Transportation. In the last report it was recorded that the Govern-ment of India had tabled the following demands for broad gauge locomotives and wagons : -(i) 5,000 wagons for delivery at the earliest possible date to balance ashort-fall in India&apos;s broad-gauge wagon production this year;(ii) up to 361 locomotives and 24,700 wagons required to be delivered in1945 in order to enable additional military load expected in 1945 tobe carried and civil traffic to be restored to a level essential to the economy of the country.General Wheeler has been reluctant to accord (United States) military support to these demands. Recently, however, he set up an ad hoc committee, with theAmerican Director of Transport, S.E.A.C. Headquarters, as Chairman, which reported that, broadly speaking, the above-mentioned demands, and also a furtherrequirement of 250 locomotives and 15,000 wagons if a specified increase in indian coal production is to be handled, are the minimum requirements necessaryto achieve the required targets. As a result of the committee&apos;s report GeneralWheeler has now supported the demand for 5,000 wagons, and arrangements havealready been made them in the Army Supply Programme in the UnitedStates for the earliest possible delivery. He has, however, so far withheld support for the additional demand for wagons and locomotives; but it is thought that this may arise from a misunderstanding, and the position is being further exploredwith him.77. Bombay Explosion. A scheme for compensation for injury and damage caused by the explosion and fire in the docks on the 14th April has been agreedupon with the insurance interests concerned and published by the Government ofIndia.   Its main features are as follows : &apos;(i) The Government of India will pay compensation in respect of propertycovered by fire policies at the rate of 100 per cent (or 87-J per cent, insome special cases). The insurance interests will make to the Govern-ment of India a voluntary bulk contribution of 12^ per cent, towardsthese payments.(ii) In the case of interests covered by marine insurance policies the insurerswill meet the ascertained claims in full and will be reimbursed by theGovernment of India to the extent of 40 per cent, of the amount paid.(iii) Claims under miscellaneous insurance policies will be met in full bythe insurers, who will be reimbursed 50 per cent, by the Governmentof India.(iv) In the case of uninsured property the Government of India will pay compensation at the rate of 75 per cent, of losses, small claimants being-paid in full.(v) In the case of uninsured personal injuries a scale of compensation hasbeen fixed on the^ general basis of that under the Indian Workmen&apos;compensation Act.[27722] c
The effect of this is that the Government of India will probably have to pay outabout  18 million, while the insurance interests will find about  4-1 million. Theobject of the scheme is to avoid long-drawn-out and contentious litigation bothbetween insured and insurers and between either and the Bombay Port Trust orthe Bibby Line as operators of the S.S. Fort Stikine. To ensure this the Govern-ment of India will shortly issue an Ordinance providing that all persons entitledto compensation under their scheme must surrender all rights arising out of the occurrence.78. Tripartite Committee in Washington. It has been decided to set upa small informal Committee in Washington consisting of the United States and united Kingdom representatives on the Combined Production and resources board and the Combined Raw Materials Board and the Indian Agent-General in washington. The proposal originated from Mr. Batt, the American representa-tive on the Combined Raw Materials Board. The function of the Committee willbe to discuss important Indian supply questions affecting the two Boards. It willin no way interfere with or duplicate existing channels of procurement, but will act as a forum for discussion of problems on which misunderstandings concerningthe Indian position have in the past arisen, through lack of information orconflicting information from various sources.79. Calcutta Port Director. Mr.&apos; Fr A. Pope, Chief Commercial Managerof the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, has been appointed Director ofCalcutta Port and has arrived in India to take up his appointment. He will haveunder him two Deputy Directors, one American and one British.

It will be the task of thenew member to co-ordinate and invigorate the activities of the Departments ofthe Government of India concerned. He will be Deputy Chairman of theReconstruction Committee.81. Coal. The Indian coal situation is again deteriorating. Raisingsduring recent months have been below expectations and pithead stocks are low.We are entering the season when the pitmen normally spend much timecultivating their fields, and this year they are leaving the mines earlier than usual. Railway coal stocks at the end of April were 12 days&apos; consumption. TheGovernment of India hope to improve the situation by extensive development of open-cast mining, for which Indian coal deposits are exceptionally favourable,and efforts are being made to obtain equipment from North America.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.Royal Indian Navy.82.   Nothing to report.Military.83. Italy. Indian troops forming part of the 8th Army have been continuously engaged in the present operations and have occupied a numberof villages to the North of Highway 6..84. North-West Frontier. The hostile tribesmen appear to have beendiscouraged by air and artillery action. The lashkar was reported to bedispersing in the middle of the month, and no incidents have occurred since.85 Burma. In general operation are being hampered by rains. Fightinghas been very savage and severe in the Kohima-Myitkyina areas. The situationcontinues to develop favourably, but progress is slow.
5*1- 86. Arakan and Kaladan. The planned withdrawal to monsoon positionshas been successfully carried out without enemy interference. There has been some slight enemy activity, but on the whole the situation is quiet.87. Imphal area. Early in the month enemy activity east and south ofPalel increased. A number of enemy attacks have been repulsed and the situationremains stable.88. In the vicinity of Bishenpur severe fighting has taken place, and has gone in our favour. Enemy attempt to cut the track Bishenpur-Silchar have failed. The road to Tiddim South of Bishenpur has been blocked by landslidescaused by our bombing and the block held by our troops who are now advancingagainst enemy troops around Bishenpur from the south. Enemy casualties were very heavy.89. North of Imphal the enemy established two fresh road blocks on theroad Imphal-Kohima in addition to one already existing. Two of these havebeen cleared. Our troops continue to make progress to the north and north-eastagainst stiff opposition. Up to the 2nd June 8,500 enemy dead have beenaccounted for.90. Kohima-Dimapur. Fighting around Kohima has continued. Theenemy to the north of Kohima have for the most part withdrawn south-eastwardsand the main enemy concentrations now appear to be some five miles to thesouth-east and south of the town. He still retains a road block on the Kohima-Imphal road.91. Hukawng Valley-North Burma. One force of General StilwelFsChinese Army in India has continued its advance on Kamaing and is now closingon the town from several directions. Another force including American Rangers,reported last month as being 50 miles north-west of Myitkyina, occupied the airfield there in the middle of the month. Fighting in the town itself is developing in our favour.92. Our Long-Range Penetration Groups have moved north-east from thearea Indaw-Katha, where they had been successfully operating since mid-March,to co-operate with General S til well&apos;s forces. Opposition to these Long-RangeGroups has increased. An airstrip established 30 miles South of Kamaing was captured by the enemy in spite of heavy casualties and our troops were forcedto withdraw westwards. Other columns are, however, advancing on Mogaungfrom the south-east and Myitkyina from the south-east.93. Salween. Chinese troops of the Yunnan Army crossed the river northand south of the Burma road in the middle of May, meeting initial oppositionwest of the river. This advance is now being somewhat impeded by the risingof the river.A ir.94. Air activity throughout the month has been on a considerable scaledespite increasingly adverse weather conditions. Over 13,000 offensive sorties were flown for the loss of 16 aircraft. Transport aircraft gave continuedsupport to the ground troops. Over 11,000 tons of supplies and more than 29,000men were, carried, while some 4,200 casualties and prisoners of war wereevacuated from the battle areas.Enemy activity was on a somewhat increased scale. Fifty enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat.General.95. Morale. There is no change in morale, which remains high. Britishtroops eagerly await the opening of the &quot; Second Front &quot; in Europe^ Relationsbetween British and Indian troops have much improved among those who haverecently fought together.96. In forward areas Indian troops make no distinction between japanese and Jifs, and regard the latter as enemies.97. Labour. A strike of stevedores at Karachi necessitated military labourbeing used in the docks. The local Government took appropriate action and thestevedores returned to work. The situation is now normal but military labour isbeing retained as a precautionary measure.[27722] c 2
98. Bombay Port reconstruction. Satisfactory progress is being made.Princes Dock is in full working order except for sheds. Four damaged ships have been removed from Victoria Dock and the work of emptying it has begun.99. Oil Pipe Lines. The Chittagong Pipe Line is being redesigned to carry6,000,000 gallons per mensem instead of 4,500,000. Work on the American pipeline from Calcutta to Dibrugarh is proceeding well and. it is estimated it will becompleted in August 1944.100. Power Stations. The power station producing three-quarters of thepower for Mysore State was put completely out of action by lightning on the19th May. A considerable loss of textiles, which are already in short supply formilitary purposes, including blankets^ heavy flannel lining, shirting, and olivegreen cellular material, will result.  Parachute production should not be affected.101. Prisoners of war. Up to the end of May 453 of the Indian prisonersof war who escaped from Epinal when it was hit by bombs from Allied planesin the second week of May have reached Switzerland safely. They report thatthey were everywhere helped by the French, including police and militia.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occupied Burma.102. A Burma Research Commission, formed by Ba Maw to study the civilian war effort and reconstruction plans in other co-prosperity countries, witha view to the establishment of a national Planning Board, has begun its tour of research in Tokyo.103. It is reported that the Burma National Army (Quisling) is 7,500strong,-and that all Government servants are required to serve in the reserve.104. The economic situation continues to deteriorate and is now very bad.Ba Maw&apos;s second attempt at price control has proved ineffective. Shortage office is so acute in Upper Burma, owing to the Japanese monopoly of transport facilities, that it is thought probable food riots may occur.Frontier A dministration.105. The Myosa of Kokang, who, as was reported in April, was forciblydetained by Chinese authorities, has been released and has now arrived in India.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. -In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Supplies for Malta.106. During the period of siege all shipments to Malta were completelyunder military control and all supplies for civilian use were procured throughGovernment channels, civil supplies from the United Kingdom being shipped bythe Crown Agents for the Colonies.The opening of the Mediterranean has rendered possible a return to more normal conditions of trade and arrangements are now being made to permit ofsupplies from the United Kingdom to Malta flowing through commercialchannels.Jamaica Dock Strike.107. Strikes and go slow methods among dock workers at Kingston,Jamaica, during the recent months had been causing such delay to the loading
and unloading of ships there that, in view of the great importance of a speedyturn round of shipping, the Ministry of War Transport felt obliged to cancelall sailings from the United Kingdom to Jamaica and to divert some ships at sea to load sugar elsewhere. The Governor pointed out the serious effects whichthis would cause in Jamaica, including congestion of export produce at the docks, and I am glad to say that as a result of improved reports upon the rateof handling cargo at Kingston, the Ministry of War Transport have now beenable to withdraw the ban on sailings to Jamaica, subject to the rate of loadingbeing kept under review.Rubber.108. As announced on the 1st May the International Rubber RegulationAgreement came to an end on the 30th April, and the Committee was dissolvedon that date.109. Arrangements have been made to maintain the Secretariat and the statistical service previously provided by the Committee. Pending the forma-tion of a new International Committee (without any restrictive powers) theSecretary and Staff are being carried on the Colonial Office vote.. 110. Discussions are proceeding with the Americans as to their member-ship of a new Committee, and it is probable that an invitation will be receivedshortly for British and Dutch Missions to visit Washington to discuss thismatter.Civil Aviation.Supply of aircraft to British West Indian Airways.111. I have been endeavouring for some months to secure three additional aircraft to assist the Company to maintain essential air services in the west indies, but difficulties have been raised first in regard to the release of engines for Ansons to be supplied from Canada and, secondly, in regard to the supply ofHudsons reported to be surplus to requirements in Canada. It has now beenagreed that three Hudsons should be released by the Royal Air Force for supply to British West Indian Airways, subject to the assent of the Combined MunitionsAssignment Board at Washington, which is being sought.Visit of Air Transport Adviser to the West Indies.112. Mr. B. C. H. Cross, my Air Transport Adviser, has left for a tour ofthe West Indies, to report generally on airfield and other civil aviation require-ments in the Colonies concerned. He will be away for some 4^ months and willvisit all the West Indian Colonies as well as British Guiana, British Hondurasand Bermuda.Labour.113. The International Labour Conference at Philadelphia adopted, withoutany dissenting vote, a Recommendation on the subject of Minimum Standards of social Policy in Dependent Territories. That Recommendation included most ofthe text which the International Labour Office had prepared for consideration bythe Conference; with one exception the remaining articles, which were omittedsolely through the impossibility of discussing them in the time available, will beplaced on the agenda for the next session of the Conference. The Recommenda-tion, aa passed by the Conference, marks a definite advance in certain matters, suchas the minimum age of employment in industry and commercial undertakings andthe provision of maternity benefits for women employed in industry. otherwise the Recommendation is generally in keeping with present British Colonial policy.114. In addition, the International Labour Conference passed a resolution calling for the reappointment of a Committee of Experts to advise on Coloniallabour problems.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.115. Political feeling among both communities increased during the past month. There was corresponding decrease of interest in the war. A Germandefeat is taken for granted, and Palestinians prefer to concentrate on their ownpost-war interests.
116. Feeling among the Arabs has been sharply stimulated during thepast month by various manifestations of Jewish political activities, and, inparticular, by the reported resolution of the British Labour Party that Arabsshould be induced to move out of Palestine to make room for Jews. There was an outburst of indignant Press comments and numerous protests from differentquarters, followed by noticeable increase in party activity.117. The Arab population, who had been inclined to regard Zionist propa-ganda abroad with little more than irritation, are now thoroughly alarmed at what they regard as this new manifestation of its effectiveness. They aregenuinely shocked and dismayed that the chosen representatives of a large sectionof the British public could contemplate the removal of Arabs from their homes inPalestine in favour of the Jews. Jewish circles also seem startled by this opendeclaration in favour of the removal of the Arab population from Palestine.They realise the potential danger to the Zionist cause of such pronouncements atthe present time, and maintain that Zionist aims can be achieved withoutdisplacing or harming the Arab population.118. There has been a relative lull in the overt activity of Jewish terrorists,who are lying low as a result of police activity. Apart from the murder of a jewish constable at Tel-Aviv on the 10th May, &quot;and an abortive attempt to broad-cast from Ramallah Broadcasting Station on the 17th, terrorists have devotedmuch time and energy to propaganda arguments with official Jewry by means ofpamphlets, and to threats against the police and anyone who helps the authorities.Public and press still maintain an anti-terrorist front. The Hebrew press, to itscredit, has published spirited rejoinders to pamphlet threats of terrorists whocastigated certain journals for publishing police notices and photographs ofwanted gangsters.Aden Protectorate.119. The latest development in the frontier dispute with the Yemen is thatthe Governor of Aden has received a letter from the Imam (the King of the Yemen)stating that he was ordering the withdrawal of his garrison from Haud al Ma, butreiterating his claim that the place is within Yemeni territory. Air action againstthe garrison has consequently not been taken, although the ultimatum hasexpired.   Confirmation of the Yemeni withdrawal is awaited.120. No change in the famine situation in the Eastern Aden Protectoratehas been reported.Gold Coast.121. In accordance with the policy of maintaining close personal contact with Governors, Sir Alan Burns, Governor of the Gold Coast, has been home for discussions this month. He arrived in England on the 8th May and left on the27th May.Malta.122. There has been evidence of increased political activity in Malta. the unofficial Members of the Legislature, particularly the members of the Consti-tutional party, have started a campaign for speeding up the consideration of anew Constitution with a view to the introduction of responsible governmentimmediately after the war in Europe comes to an end. The campaign wasinaugurated during a debate on a motion for the preparation of a new ElectoralBegister under the present Constitution and there is to be a further debate on thesame subject in June. Simultaneously there has been severe criticism of thegeneral policy and administration of the Government by the Elected Members inthe Legislature and in the Constitutional party press.Bermuda.123. A Bill for the extension of the Franchise to women on the same terms as men has now passed both Houses of the Legislature. This represents the firstmajor change in the franchise of the Colony for a considerable period.Fiji.Elections and Servicemen&apos;s votes.124. The present Legislative Council, which has now been in existence for four years, was dissolved on the 1st June, and the Governor desired to make
arrangements similar to those made in connection with recent parliamentary elections in New Zealand to enable men in the Armed Forces serving outside Fijito vote at the forthcoming general election.125. The necessary amendment to the Letters Patent, which enablesprovision to be made by local law in respect of matters relating to local elections,was approved by His Majesty in Council on the 19th May.Dispute in the Sugar Industry.126. Professor Shephard, Principal of the Imperial College of TropicalAgriculture, Trinidad, arrived in Fiji on the 14th May to begin his enquiry intothe Colony&apos;s sugar industry.Seychelles.127. Enlargement of Legislative Council. Additional Royal instructions were published in the Seychelles on the 6th May to provide for an increase in thenumber of nominated Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council from 3 to 6with a corresponding increase in the official membership.128. His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed to the introduction of electionsas soon as possible after the war in respect of up to 3 of the Unofficial Membersof the Legislative Council if in the meantime they are satisfied that elections aredesired by a substantial and representative body of public opinion amongst that part of the community which will be affected.
