Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 398.19*A July, 1944.WAR CABINET. VREPORT OF COMMITTEE ON INDIAN FINANCIAL QUESTIONS.1. Preliminary.AT their meeting on the 4th August, 1943 (W.M. (43) 111th Conclusions,Minute 1), the War Cabinet appointed a Standing Committee on Indian financial questions, comprising The Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair).The Minister of Production.The Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for War.The President of the Board of Trade.The Paymaster-General.The purposes of the Committee were defined as follows : &quot; The Committee&apos;s first task is&apos; to consider steps to combat inflationin India. This enquiry should cover such questions as whether some partof India&apos;s capacity, now devoted to war production, should not be switchedback to the manufacture of consumer goods.&quot; The Committee&apos;s second task is to examine the growing indebtednessof the United Kingdom to India.&quot;The Committee has had the problems remitted to it under continuous review and has now reached a stage at which progress can usefully be reported. Inthis Report it will be convenient, after dealing with the question of inflation, togive separate consideration, under the second head of the Committee&apos;s tasks, tothe disbursements on United Kingdom account in India and the problems raisedby the resulting sterling credits.IT r. f inna-lllliailUIli2. Development.The causes of the inflationary situation which has arisen in India are easilyseen. It is estimated that the calls upon India&apos;s resources in man-power andmaterial for direct military purposes will, in the four years ending in March, 1944,have involved the expenditure in India of approximately  1,300 million, asagainst a normal peace-time expenditure of about  34 million a year. Of this about one-half represents the production of military equipment of all kinds for despatch overseas and use in India which, together with a considerable militaryworks programme (airfields alone have cost over  50 million) has involved a greatdiversion of productive capacity and materials away from civil purposes. Duringthe same period it may be estimated that India will have exported goodsadditional to those covered by the above figure mostly tea, oilseeds and rawmaterials valued at some  500 million. Payment for all these services and supplies has involved a great outpouring of currency. The note issue, which,before the war was only  127 million, had increased by  534 million at31st March, 1944; and the coinage in circulation, increased meanwhile by 97 million. At the; same time, not only has India produced less for civil purposes, but imports have also been drastically reduced, in particular those ofgoods for civilian consumption, which fell in 1942-43 (largely as a result of the closing of Eastern sources of supply and of shipping difficulties consequent uponthe spread of the war to the Far East) to less than one-third of the pre-warstandard. As a result of the interplay of these forces, prices rose graduallyduring the first three years of the war; but although a considerable inflationary[27769]
potential was evidently being- built up, it was not until late in 1942 that analarming upsurge commenced which, by the summer of 1943, had driven theprice level up bv about 100 points to &quot;some two-and-a-half times the pre-warfigure. By this &quot;time, indeed, the full force of the effort undertaken by Indiabecame apparent in all directions. Acute shortages of food, clothing and otherbasic requirements, loss of confidence in the currency and the usual phenomenaof queues, strikes, speculation and hoarding became apparent. The situation was rendered more difficult by the inability of the over-strained transportationsystem to cope with all the demands put upon it.3. Measures taken up to August 1943.Until these violent symptoms appeared, the Government of India had not felt the need of any really drastic measures. They had concentrated upon achievingan expansion &quot;of war production and of the armed forces which was trulyremarkable but, in the absence of compelling necessity and of the backing ofpublic opinion for their war effort, they had not made corresponding progressin the difficult and unpopular field of countervailing economic adjustments. Forexample, they had proceeded but slowly to raise the pitch of their taxation andthe pressure behind their borrowing operations. Price control remainedrudimentary and control of distribution hardly existed. In judging the Govern-ment of India&apos;s record, allowance must, of course, be made for the slenderadministrative resources at their disposal in relation to the vast size and primitiveeconomic organisation of the country and also for the fact that well organisedpolitical elements were actively opposed even to such measures as were beingtaken. Notwithstanding these difficulties, they had somehow to adjust theirpolicy to the crisis which had come upon them, and to develop almost from thebeginning the machinery required to give effect to it. This necessarily took time,and it was not until the summer of 1943 that a series of measures, including freshtaxation, control of speculation, production of standard&apos; cloth, stricter controlof Government expenditure and so on, assisted by the psychological effects of thegood turn&apos; in the events of the war, began to take effect. The results were justbecoming apparent at about the time when the Committee was appointed.4. Measures taken subsequently.The measures referred to in the previous paragraph were clearly only a first instalment of what the situation required. They have since been supplementedin many important respects, as indicated in the following brief summary : A. Measures within the competence of the Government of India.(a) Taxation. After full discussion in the Committee, the Secretary of Statefor India addressed to the Government of India a telegram pressing them for amuch more vigorous effort to absorb currency through taxation, and the budget proposals, introduced in the Legislative Assembly by the Finance Member at theend of February and passed into law with the help of the certification procedure,go far to give effect to this. Without going into details, their severity may be judged from the fact that they are designed to raise an additional sum of about 60 million (including  37-4 million non-recurrent) in the current year, ascompared with total revenue receipts of  196 million in the previous year.(b) Borroiving. Since the summer of 1943 the Government of India havebeen making determined efforts to strengthen their borrowing campaign. Theyhave been reorganising their small savings machinery,* they are trying the deviceof Prize Bonds, and it appears that their policy generally is now animated by a proper sense of urgency. Already in 1943-44 they expect to have raised 84 million more than the Budget estimate for the year, and in the current year a further improvement to the extent of  24 million is expected in theestimates as laid before the Legislature. Meanwhile, a measure of co-operationhas been forthcoming from the Provincial Governments, who have both increased the pitch of their taxation and provided the necessary machinery for carrying the borrowing campaign into the countryside.(c) Controls. In the field of basic requirements, control of prices anddistribution is being developed, and where, as in the case of cloth and oil, suppliescan without undue difficulty be regulated, good results have been achieved.General legislation against hoarding and profiteering has been passed, and central machinery has been set up which the Government of India hope may secureuniform enforcement by the Provinces.   The difficulties in a large and primitive* This is particularly important. In the three years 1940-41 to 1942-43 there was actuallya net outflow of small savings amounting to  32 million.
economy like that of India are great, and much remains to be done, but progress is undoubtedly being made in the right direction.B. Measures involving external assistance.(a) Gold imports. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment are at present supplying gold for sale in India in amounts which, ifa satisfactory price is maintained and supplies continue to be available, may wellabsorb  140 million of purchasing power in a year. (The relative proportions ofthe gold supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Government and by the United StatesGovernment are at present 2\ : L) From the point of view of the inflationarysituation in India, this is a most valuable supplement to the other means of keeping the currency down, and it has the additional advantage of providing an alternativeholding for those who might otherwise hoard commodities. From His Majesty&apos;governments point of view, it has the advantage that the substantial premiumin the Indian price over the London price increases the amount available for their military expenditure in India. But the ability of His Majesty&apos;s Government tomake gold available for this purpose depends on the factors governing their gold and United States dollar position as a whole, and the time must come, possiblysoon, when supplies of gold will not continue to be available at any rate on thepresent scale. In view of the importance of gold sales for the policy of economicstabilisation in India, it would then be necessary to give earnest considerationto the possibility of persuading the United States Government to make availablefor sale in India supplies of gold in excess of the amounts required to cover their military expenditure in that country.*(b) Silver imports. After much pressure and long negotiation, the americans have at last agreed to supply 100 million ounces of silver to india which the Government of India may sell for anti-inflationary purposes, or, ifnecessary, use for coinage. In order to secure their agreement it proved necessaryfor the United Kingdom Government to undertake responsibility for replacing thesilver after the war if the Government of India should for any reason fail to fulfill their own obligation in this respect. Meanwhile the Americans have declined forthe time being to consider India&apos;s separate request for 65 million ounces forcoinage, for which purpose silver is at present being absorbed at the rate of85 million ounces a year.(c) Diversion of production demands. The Government of India are endeavouring to establish programmes involving the stabilisation of demands forwar purposes upon Indian productive capacity and the diversion of orderselsewhere, in order that more consumer goods may be provided for the Indianpopulation. Negotiations have been proceeding between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Government of India on the detailed implementation of the latter&apos;sproposals. They have reached a stage at which, while certain reliefs upon india have been accepted, the Government of India have been strongly urged to reconsider certain of their proposals which it would be impossible to acceptwithout serious detriment to the military effort of the British Empire. Thereliefs have to some extent been afforded by drawing upon stocks or by other methods which do not involve substantial additional loads upon United Kingdomcapacity, since the latter is already strained to the utmost. In certain caseshelp is being sought from United States Administration. Some of the loadwhich the United States are being asked to take over is in types of requirementwhich may impinge upon the standards of domestic consumption in the UnitedStates itself; and it may be difficult to get the help required, especially in an election year. But of course the necessity for assistance to India is not restricted to the current year.(d) Imports of consumer goods. The question of food supplies is of funda-mental importance for the whole policy of economic stabilisation. It has, however,been separately under consideration by the Cabinet and is not, therefore, dealtwith in this Report. The question of materially increasing supplies of othergoods to India raises similar issues to those mentioned under (c) above. Steps arebeing taken to obtain such consumer goods as may be readily available in theUnited States, to the value of some $10 million, as soon as possible, and efforts arebeing made to increase shipments to India out of the very limited supplies avail-able in the United Kingdom.* The decision has now been taken that supplies for sale on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must be limited to 1  million ounces (instead of 2^ million) in the quarter ending on 30th September next and must be discontinued thereafter. The question of an approach tothe United States Government for the provision of more gold in India is now being considered as part of the more general issues raised in W.P. (44) 360.[27769] b 2
(e) Transportation. It is generally agreed that India&apos;s requirements of transportation equipment including locomotives and wagons rank withfoodstuffs in the highest category of need. Movements of defence supplies and personnel, the production of war industries, the movement of foodstuffs themselves and of coal and raw materials and the maintenance of essential civil traffic, arealike imperilled by the grave inadequacy of the existing equipment relative toactual and prospective demands. Material assistance has already been arranged,but the task of meeting 1945 demands, the nature and extent of which are still under consideration, threatens to raise very serious problems.5. Present Position.As a result of all the measures described above, there can be no doubt that thecontrol of the position as a whole is much more effective now than it was ten months ago, and it is significant that the general price index has been held almoststeady, within a few points of the highest level reached last summer, for abouta year, despite considerable further additions to the currency outstanding.There was a fair prospect, before the continuance of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;sgold sales became uncertain, that, in the current year, the gap between freshoutpourings of currency and their absorption through the channels of taxation,borrowing, bullion sales, &amp;c, would, for the first time, be reduced to a compara-tively reasonable size.* But, given the utmost perseverance, which is clearlyindispensable, in strengthening and enforcing what has already been done,financial measures are not alone sufficient to restore economic equilibrium, sincesome increased availability of goods and improvement of the transport system may also be essential if the maintenance of civil life at even a minimum level is to be assured. Moreover, there still remains the inflationary potential piled up in previous years which may in certain circumstances make itself felt. Any satis-faction with the progress so far made must, therefore, in any case be tempered withcaution. But this is not all. The greatest strain upon India may yet have tocome in connection with its use as an operational base for the South-East Asiacampaign. This provides the criterion by which India&apos;s needs must now be judged. It is clear that before any particular plans are finally accepted it will benecessary to obtain some assurance either that they will be within India&apos;s capacity to fulfil, or that any assistance required from outside will be forthcoming. Mean-while the Committee are engaged in the task of establishing the minimum ofassistance which must be given from outside, whatever form the precise plan thatis ultimately adopted may take.II. United Kingdom Expenditure in India.6. Balance of Payments.As a preliminary to this and the next succeeding section of this Report, someanalysis is necessary of the heads under which payments have been made to India,from which the sterling accretions have resulted.   The following rough analysis* The progress made may be illustrated by the following figures of the gap between out-goings and withdrawals of rupees.

is confined to four completed financial years, from 1940-41 to 1943-44. It is presented in this form in order that the nature and relative importance of the factors contributing to the growth of the sterling balances may be appreciated.Particulars of the total accretions during the war are given in paragraph 31below.On the. 5th April, 1940, the Reserve Bank of India held sterling assetsamounting to  106 million. On the 31st March, 1944, the assets amounted to 710 million an increase of  604 million. Meanwhile  298 million had beenabsorbed in debt repatriation operations and  98 million had been used to finance the Government of India&apos;s current expenditure in London. Adding together thelast three figures ( 604 plus  298 plus  98 million) we may say roughly that thetotal sterling accruals to be accounted for during the four-year period amountedto  1,000 million.   The main contributory items may be set out as follows :   million.1. Excess of India&apos;s exports to, over imports from, theUnited Kingdom   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      1042.

Of these 1, which covers the supply of food-stuffs and raw materials to the United Kingdom, is not relevant to the existinginter-Governmental financial arrangements, since these imports are not arranged,or financed through or by the Government of India, as would be done if, but only if, there were in existence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and India a fullmutual aid arrangement. It will be seen that far the largest amounts under theremaining heads are for the acquisition and transportation of stores for forces[27769] b 3
I overseas and the Dominions (6 (a) and (6)); and we wish to point out particularly; that the munitions and equipment which are sent from the United Kingdom toIndia are, on the other hand, not charged for, nor indeed recorded. This arrange-ment was made under an agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theI Government of India, whereby the former undertook to provide without charge the equipment and supplies from overseas required for the expansion of the Forces inIndia, on condition that the Government of India provided such equipment and supplies as could be found in India and met the maintenance charges of theForces while they remained in India. It was, in fact, designed roughly to allocate the cost of expansion on a fifty-fifty basis, thus treating it in the same way as other &quot; joint measures.&quot; The amounts involved are not known, but theyare considerable . They have obviously increased in importance since the arrange-ment was made and become a major item in the current transactions between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and India.8. The Defence Expenditure Plan.The Plan which governs the incidence of military expenditure as between india and the United Kingdom, as settled in February, 1940, has broadly the effectof leaving India to bear local defence costs arising in India, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to bear the full costs of Indian Forces employed outside India,subject to a contribution by India representing the normal cost of any such forces as were in India before the war. More specifically it has led, as the war has developed, to the following results. The figures quoted give the cumulative sums involved in the four years 1940-41 to 1943-44.The Government of India have met    million.(i) the cost of all the forces required for the local defence of India(i.e., in practice, up to the present, all military and airforces, European and Indian, in India and the Royal Indian-&apos; Navy, including the capital costs in connection with them,e.g., of the airfields needed against Japanese invasion, andthe costs of all special local defence measures) other than the&quot; modernisation &quot; costs referred to in (v) below, and the costof  equipment for  such  forces  furnished  from  overseasreferred to in (ix) below ...       ...      ...       ...       ...       ...       565-J;-(ii) the &apos;: normal &quot; cost of certain troops earmarked before the war for external defence, approximating to about a division,again subject to the free provision of equipment furnishedfrom overseas      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        10(iii) one crore of rupees as a non-recurring contribution towards the&apos;&apos; extra &apos;&apos; cost of such external defence troops under active service conditions outside India        ...       ...       ...       ... I(iv) one-quarter of the &quot; modernisation &quot; costs referred to in (v)below       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 8-gHis Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government have borne (v) under the agreed Chatfield arrangements, three-quarters of thecapital cost of various &quot; modernisation &quot; measures in india which have been treated as substantially equivalent to the chatfield recommendations      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        251(vi) the^ cost of all munitions and stores produced in India (inclu-ding the capital cost of extending facilities) which are treatedas a debit against His Majesty&apos;s Government in the firstinstance subject to an adjustment by Indian acceptance of a charge in respect of all stores produced in India which arerequired by the troops referred to under (i) above   ...      ...      462^(vii) the pay and allowances of India&apos;s troops serving overseas, lessdeductions in respect of item (ii) above      ...      ...      ...        42(viii) the cost of other services rendered by India mainly in con-nection with overseas operations, namely, custody and main-tenance of prisoners of war, transportation of personnel, pro-vision of store and supply depots, war hospitals, cash, roads and buildings, and various measures of a joint character   ...      163(ix) the cost of the equipment (aircraft, weapons, &amp;c.) supplied from overseas for the Indian forces, both inside and outsideIndia, apart from motor transport and lend-lease or mutual aid items.....................        Unknown
It will be seen from the above that there is an important element of non-reciprocity in our financial arrangements with India. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment supplies India without charge with all the imports from whatever source(with the exception of Lend-Lease supplies and motor transport) which sherequires for the expansion forces as explained in paragraph 7. On theother hand, defence stores (item (vi) above) sent from India have all beencharged to the United Kingdom since the Plan is merely concerned with theallocation of expenditure required for the defence of India in a sense which mayhave been appropriate in 1939, but is now affected by factors, referred to in thenext paragraph, that have developed subsequently. Anything contributed by india to the common war effort outside India has to be paid for in the same way as ordinary exports. The cost of the goods supplied by India under item (vi)above has risen enormously, partly because their volume has exceeded expecta-tions, and partly because the inflation in India has raised prices so much that overa wide range of goods and services the purchasing power of the rupee has fallenmuch below that of the sterling equivalent, Is. %d., at which the rupees areacquired for sterling.9. Possibility of modifying the Plan.When the Plan was drawn up, the war was remote from India&apos;s frontiers,but subsequently India herself has been directly threatened by both Germany and japan. The exports of defence stores for which the United Kingdom pays india have, therefore, contributed directly to the defence of India herself, and, since hersecurity is now. more immediately bound up with the success of the war effort ofthe United Nations, there is a prima facie case for contending that the change in circumstances justifies a broader interpretation of India&apos;s obligations and a revision of the financial arrangements. In any case, the Chancellor of theExchequer always reserved the right to raise the question of a further contribution-tion from India. From India&apos;s side, on the other hand, it would be contended that the Plan has already operated more unfavourably than was expected, owingto the prolonged retention in India of very large forces, both British and Indian.On broader grounds, too, India would probably contend that she has paid a very heavy price for so poor a country in the shape of deprivation and starvation.The figures above show that the only adjustment of the Plan which would havean appreciable effect on the magnitude of the problem to be faced eventually wouldbe a completely new arrangement on mutual aid lines. It does not seem to us thatthere is any hope of getting this accepted by India. More modest proposals ofmodification, directed to getting India to bear a greater contribution of the external costs of her Forces, which would, in the opinion of the Committee, be in themselves entirely justifiable, would nevertheless encounter grave political difficulty in India, and, since it would almost inevitably be regarded as a final settlement of the whole problem, might well spoil the prospect of some adjustmenton broader lines later. The Committee therefore recommend that it is not wiseor practicable to try to modify the Plan at precisely this moment.10. Value received for expenditure in India.A question to which the Committee have given some attention, and whichmay possibly be relevant to any final settlement with India, is that of the pricespaid by the Government of India for supplies procured on behalf of the UnitedKingdom. This concerns particularly the large item of munitions and suppliescovered by 6 in paragraph 6 above. The arrangements, deliberately made to minimise accounting work, utilised the Government of India&apos;s own machinery offinancial control, and did not require separate accounts to be kept for that partof each item of supply destined for use by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It has there fore proved somewhat difficult for the Government of India to collect all theinformation that the Committee require for reaching any conclusions on thisquestion, but fuller details have just been received. The two points which theCommittee have particularly in mind as requiring further attention are the extentto which inflationary factors have swollen the expenditure incurred (a point which, of course, arises also when considering the expenditure incurred in anumber of other countries), and the question whether the Government of India&apos;control of costs has been adequate.   These matters will be pursued.
III. Sterling Balances.11. Dimensions of the problem.The factors which have led to the growth of India&apos;s sterling balances are clearly illustrated by the figures in paragraph 6 above. The latest date for whichcomplete figures of India&apos;s aggregate sterling assets are available is the31st March, 1944, when they totalled  770 million. (A comparable figure forthe beginning of the war is not available, but, of the  770 million,  710 million was held by the Reserve Bank as against  33 million held by that institution onthe 25th August, 1939.) But for repatriation operations, &amp;c; during the war,which have absorbed about  320 million, the balances on the 31st March, 1944,would have totalled about  1,090 million. It is impossible Lo say at what rate the balances will continue to grow, owing to uncertainty as to the future course ofpayments by His Majesty&apos;s Government and of receipts from gold sales, but 400 million a year, less the amount which it may be found possible to meet fromthe proceeds of the sale of gold, may be taken as an approximate figure. How longthis will continue depends, of course, on the still more uncertain factor of thefuture course of the war.12. Other countries.India is the largest single holder of sterling, but very large sterling holdings stand to the credit of other countries. With those of India referredto in the preceding paragraph, they amounted in all at the 31st March,1944, to  2,644 million. The proportions of these holdings which have in thepast been, and will necessarily continue to be, held in sterling, e.g., as working-balances or currency reserves, differ widely from country to country, and thedifficulties which will have to be met cannot be measured by the absolutemagnitude of the individual holdings. But it is clear that a common problemexists and that the Indian question cannot well be settled in isolation. It isquite certain that special arrangements will have to be made eventually to dealwith a problem of such magnitude, and that its solution affects all countrieswhich have an interest in the future stability of sterling. What those arrange-ments can be, over what period they will have to be spread and the appropriateinterest terms must depend, in the Committee&apos;s view (i) on the ultimate magnitude of the total problem, which cannot now before seen;(ii) on other factors entering into the post-war balance of payments;(iii) on the principles agreed by the United Nations for the post-warsettlement.13. Immediate questions.The Committee accordingly do not feel that the ultimate settlement of theproblem of India&apos;s sterling balances can usefully be considered at this juncture.It is, however, essential that the terms of such a settlement should not be prejudiced by anything- done in the meantime. The Government of India,having exhausted the possibility of repatriating Government sterling loans, have proposed that further sums.of considerable magnitude should be taken out ofthe Reserve Bank&apos;s holdings (where they earn approximately 1 per cent.) andinvested either under specific arrangements with His Majesty&apos;s Government, orin marketable securities, at 2\ or 3 per cent. Whatever the merits of thearguments adduced by the Government of India in support of this proposal, theCommittee feel that the time has come when the principle must be plainlyestablished that the repatriation operations already facilitated go as far as can be permitted in the direction of capitalising on a commercial basis assetsaccruing during the war and that the remaining balances must be regarded asabnormal and dealt with under arrangements to be made eventually in which that fact is fully recognised. To treat the sterling balances on normal commerciallines in the meantime will, in the Committee&apos;s view, lessen the prospect of an ultimate solution which will preserve from serious injury the whole complex of world-wide interests, including those of India itself, depending on the stability of sterling.14. Ultimate solution.We are not concerned, as a Committee, with the ultimate settlement of thegeneral problem of the sterling balances, except in so far as it is the framework
into which the post-war financial settlement with India must be fitted. Wethink&quot; it certain that no Government of India will be &quot;willing or able to accept theprinciple, enunciated by President Roosevelt, that none of the United nations should end up the war with a monetary war debt to any of its partners. On thecontrary, we expect that the claims which will be initially put forward on behalfof India will give rise to difficult negotiations if a settlement is to be reachedwhich will be within our post-war capacity and fair in relation to the claims of our other creditors. For such a settlement, even if (a) the Far Eastern waris over within (say) two years, and (b) everything possible is done henceforwardin restraint of the additional growth of the balances caused by inflation, italready seems clear that (i) the interest element will have to be minimised, and(ii) some reduction of the capital will be necessary, preferably in the form of a contribution by India rather than by the acceptance of counter-claims against their.That India will agree to abatements of her claims such as to bring theIndian sterling balances within our capacity to liquidate them, together withthose of other countries, over an acceptable period of years, seems to us doubtful,but not impossible. India, and also our other creditors, will have a real interestin preserving the value of their assets and our power to continue to buy their current production, and they may, therefore, be persuaded that it is not in theirown interests to seek to put too great a strain on us. They will not, if they havegrowing industries, be over-anxious to stimulate imports other than of capital goods, and for these we should be well placed to undertake supplies. They willall be aware that the resources in gold and dollars out of which we could makeany capital payment will be very limited. It is assumed that political circum-stances will be such that Indian opinion will be ready to accept a settlement which is in fact reasonable; and that our prestige will have been restored by a victorious outcome to the Eastern war.15. Summary.(a) Inflation.Considerable progress has been made by the Government of India towardssecuring command of the situation, but the question how much further assistance is required from outside, if India is to stand the strain involved in the South-East Asia campaign, cannot yet be answered.(b) United Kingdom Expenditure.It is inopportune to propose any amendment of the Defence ExpenditurePlan. Nor can the supplies which His Majesty&apos;s Government are drawing from india be forgone. It is possible, for the present, only to ensure that the terms of contracts under which supplies are obtained are as favourable as circumstancesallow, and to aim at keeping down inflation, with its inevitable repercussionupon costs.(c) Sterling Balances.The future growth of the balances cannot be either estimated or prevented,and we must rely upon effecting a settlement in respect of India&apos;s abnormalbalances at a more propitious time. Meanwhile nothing should be done to prejudice this ultimate settlement.(Intd.) J. A.,on behalf of the Committee.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.19*7* July, 1944.
