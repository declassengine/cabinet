(44) 84th Conclusions, Minute 1).0. L.Great George Street, S. W. 1,5th July, 1944.&quot;OVERLORD&quot; SECURITY.Duration of Special Restrictions.Report by Sir Findlater Stewart.At their meeting on the 29th June (W.M. (44) 84th Conclusions, Item 1),the War Cabinet discussed the withdrawal of the special &quot;Overlord&quot; securityrestrictions at the end of June, and some objection was seen to those of the suggested relaxations which involved public announcements.  The War Cabinet &quot; (1) Agreed that Sir Findlater Stewart, after consultation with theDepartments concerned, should report further on the proposals for thewithdrawal of &apos; Overlord &apos; security measures in the reports annexed to W.P. (44) 349 and W.P. (44) 350, in the light of the discussion.In particular, attention should be directed to the possibility of devisingadministrative relaxations which would remove the need for any public announcement with regard to the visitors&apos; ban or the Irish travel ban.(2) Approved the withdrawal from the 1st July of any measures which couldbe withdrawn without public announcement or other overt action likelyto prejudice the Supreme Commanders plans.&quot;I have discussed these conclusions with the Departments principally concerned, and this report is accepted by all of them, including S.H.A.E.F. Thefirst point to be made is that all the relaxations, whether or not they involve overtaction or a public announcement, will sooner or later come to the notice of theenemy. Taken by themselves many of theln are of little importance from thepoint of view of cover, but the only certain way of preventing any damage whichthey might cause collectively to the cover plan would be to keep all the restrictions in force for a further period.   This is more than S.H.A.E.F. asked for; when[27768] b
my last report was written they kept their requirements to a minimum, so as toreduce so far as possible the difficulties and inconveniences involved. Moreover, theadvice of the Security Service is that the enemy will attach far more importanceto relaxations which are publicly announced, or which involve the overt restorationof temporarily suspended services, than to measures which they will only learn ofgradually as their effects become apparent. We have therefore assumed that theWar Cabinet will not wish to&apos;suspend action on any relaxations which, since theydo not involve either announcement or overt action, in accordance with the second of the conclusions quoted above, were due to be withdrawn from the 1st July.S.H.A.E.F. accept this, and the Departments concerned are taking thenecessary steps.It remains to consider those relaxations which do involve a public announce-ment, or at least action which will be immediately apparent to the enemy. Theseare : (a) The reduction of the area to which the visitors&apos; ban applies.(b) The removal of the restrictions on overseas travel.(c) The withdrawal of the restrictions on travel between Great Britain andIreland.(d) The restoration of the air services run by Aer Lingus Teoranta and swedish A.B. Aero Transport,(e) The removal of the restrictions on telephone calls to Ireland.if) The restoration of the E.F.M. telegram service.\g) The restoration of the air mail services to foreign countries and- Gibraltar, and to prisoners of war in Germany,(/i) The amendment of the Control of Communications Order to permit theexport of second-class mails (parcels, printed matter and newspapers)to Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.We set out below the considerations which apply in each case.(a) The Visitors&apos; Ban.The public would not benefit from any reduction in the area to which thevisitors&apos; ban applies unless the relaxation were publicly announced. There isno system of permits for entry into the banned areas : every person who entersthe areas is at peril of prosecution and expulsion, unless he can establish thathe is a member of one of the permitted classes which have been fully publicisedin the Press. It would be quite wrong to allow those who wish to defy the banto do so with impunity, while leaving the great mass of law-abiding citizens inignorance of the fact that there is no longer any prohibition on their entry. Thepublic must in fairness be informed, in the only way possible ii.e., by public announcement), that the area closed to them has been reduced.It is not practicable therefoi^ to change the areas to which the visitors&apos; banapplies without making some announcement. An alternative that has beensuggested is to leave the banned area as it is at present, but to relax the stringentrestriction on the classes of people at present allowed to enter it. In thisconnection, the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Office have suggested thatany woman or child who is situated in an area exposed to attack by flying bombsmight be allowed to enter the visitors&apos; ban area in future to stay with relativesand friends; at present this concession is limited to persons who have been rendered homeless by enemy action. LTnless such a concession were announcedpublicly few people would benefit until the facts began to become known; itwould be possible to circularise Local Authorities and Chief Constablesconfidentially on the subject of the new concession, but this would mean that onlypeople who applied to one or other of these quarters for permission would learnof the change in the arrangements. The question would &quot;at once arise howapplications addressed to other quarters ie.g., Members of Parliament) should be answered. If they were refused, the concession would operate most unfairly, andif they were granted it would be difficult to explain why the concession had never been publicly announced. In either event there would undoubtedly be questions in the House, with the inevitable publicity, and probably a political storm sooner or later. A possible alternative would be to authorise the posting of notices bylocal authorities and Chief Constables, with prohibition of Press comment; evenif such prohibition could be made effective, which the Ministry of Informationdoubt, this would not of course prevent the concession f rom becoming known tothe enemy at some stage, with its implication that the flying bomb attacks were having a serious effect.
There are thus four possible courses : &apos;(i) To continue for a further period the visitors&apos; ban on all areas as atpresent.(ii) To revoke it in the area to the west of Southampton on the linespreviously suggested (see W.P. (44) 350), making a public announce-ment about the change.(iii) To continue as in (i), but to add a new class to the categories of personspermitted to enter the areas namely, women and children resident in areas liable to attack by flying bombs and to announce this concession, with or without control of Press comment.(iv) To proceed on the lines of (ii), adding a new permitted class on thelines of (iii) for the remaining areas.Of the possible courses, S.H.A.E.F. are strongly in favour of (ii). From thepoint of view of the cover plan, they feel that the release of the area west ofSouthampton would be an advantage, and any publicity given to it would con-tribute to the success of the plan. But in their view it would be preferable, if thearea west of Southampton is released, not to make an addition to the permittedclasses allowing women and children to enter the area still subject to the ban.They feel that, whether or not there is any public announcement about the concession, the facts wili soon become known to the enemy. On the other hand, theMinistry of Health and the Scottish Office would welcome a concession for theremaining area in respect of Women and children from areas liable to attack by flying bombs, the main difficulty being the question of public announcementdiscussed above. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that considerable numbersof women and children have already taken refuge in these areas and have had tobe accommodated in rest centres or billeted by the local authorities, and there canbe no question for the present of turning these people or further refugees frombombing out of the areas.(b) Overseas Travel.No new legislation was required when the special restrictions on travel toand from Great Britain were imposed; but the restrictions were announcedpublicly, and it was made clear that in future no one could travel except on business of national&quot; importance which could not reasonably be postponed.Reversion to the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; position means the removal of the secondcondition mamely, that the business in question could not reasonably be post-poned and the resumption of travel on compassionate grounds or for personalreasons (e.g., Dominion nationals returning home, and wives and families joininghusbands permanently stationed abroad). It would be possible, by administrative action, to apply the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; criterion to all future applications for permission to travel; the difficulty is that many persons, knowing the terms ofthe latest announcement on this subject, would not apply for such permission, and,when later they discovered that other persons with no greater claims than theirsto travel had been allowed to leave, there might be a good deal of complaint.Moreover, these relaxations could not be concealed from Dominion and AlliedGovernments and would soon become known and attract publicity in othercountries.The alternatives therefore are :  (i) To relax the restrictions on the lines suggested in W.P. (44) 349, making apublic announcement about the relaxation.(ii) To retain the restrictions in their present form for a further period, theHome Office having discretion to relax administratively the presentstringency.S.H.A.E.F. are strongly opposed to the first alternative. As regards thesecond, they agree that the Home Office might reinstate compassionate reasons inthe list of criteria justifying the grant of an exit permit, and they do not oppose the announcement of a concession in these limited terms to the public.(c) Irish travel.Travel between Great Britain and Ireland is at present only permissible on business of national importance which cannot be postponed, or on the strongestcompassionate grounds. It would be possible to make administrative relaxationsby granting compassionate exemption more easily than under the existing arrange-ments; but if travel on ordinary business is to be facilitated, and if Irish labour is[27768] &apos;   n 2
to be encouraged to come to this country in time for the harvest, a public announce-ment will be necessary. It has been suggested that in the case of Eire workers at present in this country, who are not at present allowed to go home on leave, theycould in future be allowed their twice-yearly holidays if the Ministry of Labourwere to inform employers confidentially that the leave certificate arrangements were being reintroduced. This would not, however, benefit the majority of theNorthern Irish workers in this country. Moreover, if this were done the factswould soon become known to the press, who have been showing an interest in thesubject for some time, and publication could probably not be avoided here, and could certainly not be prevented in Eire. Northern Ireland workers and residentsin this country, and pro-British Eire nationals here, would, when they learnt ofthis concession,-have justifiable grounds for complaint, and would at once pleadequal rights; the political reactions would therefore quickly produce the publicitythe arrangements were designed to avoid.The alternatives again are :  (i) To announce the relaxation of the restrictions on travel between GreatBritain and Ireland,(ii) To retain the restrictions in their present form, giving the Home Officediscretion to relax the present stringent control of travel for compas-sionate reasons.S.H.A.E.F. are strongly in favour of the latter alternative. On the other hand,the arguments for the removal of the restrictions are substantial:  (i) they have seriously interfered with the flow of Irish labour to thiscountry it is understood, however, that the Eire Government have withdrawn, with certain minor qualifications, their restrictions onEire workers who wish to come to Great Britain, and that the flow ofsuch workers is likely to increase very shortly; and(ii) they affect most seriously the Northern Irish and the pro-British elements in Eire who have good reasons for wishing to travel between GreatBritain and Ireland.(d) A ir Lines.- If either the Aer Lingus Teoranta or the Swedish A.B. Aero transport services are re-started, the facts4 will be public knowledge almost at once. Itwould be inconsistent to reopen the Irish line, and indeed unnecessary, if the banon travel between Great Britain and Ireland is retained. If the Swedish linewere opened it would be necessary to open the Irish one at the same time, in viewof Eire&apos;s anxiety to be treated as a neutral.It is suggested that these two air services should remain suspended for afurther period; S.H.A.E.F. favour this proposal, and the Departments concerned are prepared to accept it.(e) Telephone Calls to Ireland.It would be a relatively easy matter to relax the restrictions on telephonecalls between Great Britain and Ireland administratively; the General PostOffice would simply issue confidential instructions about the relaxation to their local officials, and it would at once be put into effect. It would, however, quicklybecome known that calls between Great Britain and Ireland were no longerrestricted, the fact would be reported in both the British and the Eire Press,and therefore a public announcement would only be avoided at the expense ofuncontrolled publicity a few days later. .  &apos;It would, moreover, be inconsistent to reopen telephone communication between Great Britain and Ireland while retaining the restrictions on Irishtravel; admittedly, there would still be 100 per cent, censorship of telephone callsto and from Ireland, but the public would not appreciate this, and wouldprobably regard relaxation in one respect, while the restrictions continued in another, as indicative of administrative muddle.In this case, therefore, it is suggested that, whatever action is taken inrespect of the Irish travel ban, corresponding action should be taken as regardstelephonic communication with Ireland.(f) Expeditionary Force Messages.Since the bulk of E.F.M. telegrams go by wireless, the enemy would soonknow that the service had been restored, even if there were no public announce-ment on the subject. It will not, therefore, be possible to keep the restorationof the service secret for any length of time.
On the other hand, it will be inconsistent to keep the service suspendedonce the delays on overseas telegrams have been removed, and steps are already being taken to cut clown these delays to the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; figure.S.PLA.E.F. see no objection to an announcement that the E.F.M. telegramservice is being restored; the step is one of small significance, and it is unlikelythat the enemy would attach much importance to it. It is therefore suggestedthat in this case an announcement is permissible.(g) Air Mail.Though the suspension of the air mail service to foreign countries and gibraltar, and to prisoners of war in Germany, was announced, the air services which formerly carried this mail are still in operation, and are, in fact, in somecases, being used for the carriage of ordinary mail after the agreed delay hasbeen imposed in this country. The General Post Office would be prepared tosend letters to prisoners of war by this service without delay, which would mean that letters would reach prisoners in the near future at the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; rateeven though the air mail service was not officially restored; they could not, how-ever, do the same for other air mail without announcing the fact. If it were agreed that the Post Office should proceed on these lines, the enemy would soonlearn that the delays on mail to prisoners of war had ceased, though probably not so quickly as he would discover that the E.F.M. service had been restored.S.H.A.E.F. would not object to an announcement that all the cancelled airmail services were being restored: it is therefore suggested that this should bedone, since not only prisoners of war but members of the Forces in Gibraltarwould then benefit.(h) Second-Class Mails to Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.An amendment to the Control of Communications Order will be necessaryin order to remove the restrictions on the export of parcels and newspapers tothe troops in Northern Ireland and Gibraltar and, whether or not any announcc-ment is made, the facts about this amendment will soon become known. S.H.A.E.F.feel that the enemy would attach little, if any, significance to the step, and it istherefore suggested that in this case there is no need to suspend, action.It remains to consider the length of time for which those of the aboverestrictions which it is decided should remain in force in whole or in part shouldcontinue. The Departments concerned would be content -if the position werereviewed in a month&apos;s time (on, say, the 1st August), in the light of the currentappreciation of the value of the cover plan. If, in the meantime, it becomesapparent that the cover plan is no longer succeeding, S.H.A.E.E. will at oncereport the fact and the relaxation of those restrictions which are still in force willbe considered forthwith.There is one further point. The problem of &quot; big ben &quot; security is at present being discussed interdepartmentally, and the Air Staff attach the greatest importance to the denial to the enemy of any information as to the fall of hisshot if long-range rockets are launched against this country. Drastic steps arcbeing contemplated in this direction, including the imposition of a ban ondiplomatic communications for at least 48 hours. Clearly, this plan could not be complete if travel to and from this country either to Ireland or to overseas destina-tions such as Lisbon were unrestricted; for a traveller with first-hand information about the &quot; Bigden &quot; attack who told his experiences would, either wittingly orinnocently, be carrying vital information at least part of the way to the enemy.There is here, therefore, a second argument for retaining these restrictions fora further period. Similar considerations apply in respect of telephone calls toIreland, and it might well be necessary to step up to 100 per cent, once more the censorship of mail to Ireland.(Signed) S. F.
