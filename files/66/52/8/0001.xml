The publication of these figures will give the enemy an exact statementof the effect of his attack so far as loss of life and injury to civilians is concerned.At the least this will be valuable to him by enabling him to take stock of theprogress of his attack and to consider the scale and tempo upon which it shouldbe continued.2. It is difficult to say whether the publication of casualties will yield theenemy any useful information as to the number of flying bombs that have dropped in built-up areas. Our own knowledge of the average effect of a given weight of bombs in causing casualties in built-up areas is derived from an elaboratecasualty survey extending over a long time. It seems unlikely that the enemycould draw any useful conclusions about the number of his missiles which had dropped in built-up areas from these figures, but the possibility that the figuresmay be some guide cannot be entirely ruled out.3. The proportion of seriously and slightly injured to killed is very high much higher than in the case of the February raids or the raiding in 1940-41.This may conceivably be related to the fact that the bomb explodes on impact witha high blast effect. If so, the figures may help to confirm the enemy&apos;s assumptions about the performance of these bombs, and may provide him with some roughestimate of the damage to buildings.4. The figures are high : the total of killed and seriously injured up to the evening of the 29th June, a period of 14 days and 14 nights is 7,403 as comparedwith 16,456 for the whole month of September 1940, the worst month of the blitzperiod. This may give encouragement to the enemy and will certainly be exploited by his propaganda.For.1. If we now for the first time withhold casualty figures from publication,the public, will conclude that this is because we have something to conceal; infact that the Government is afraid to let the people know the extent of the lossby death and injury which the enemy has succeeded in inflicting upon ourpopulation. No amount of explanation that this course is necessary for securityreasons would be likely to remove this impression, and the worst possible effecton morale would result.2. The enemy would be able to point to the withholding of the figures asproof of the extravagant claims of his propaganda, and the effect of hispropaganda would be enhanced enormously, not only upon his own people, butupon neutrals, and upon our own population.
On balance it seems to me that the arguments for publication outweigh those for withholding publication. The figures may be of some use to the enemy, butthe extent to which they would assist him is a matter of conjecture. On theother hand, the results of withholding publication would, in my view, be veryserious from the point of view of morale, and this consideration would be ofspecial importance if the threat of a new form of attack should ever materialise.The Air Ministry have been consulted and share my view, and if mycolleagues agree I would propose to publish the figures in the usual way.H. M.Home Office and Ministry ofHome Security, Whitehall, S.W. 1,30th June, 1944.
