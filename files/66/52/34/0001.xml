THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET:----..........iW.P. (44) 384.7 th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.DISPOSAL OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED FACTORIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.1. As the scale of our war production- is reduced a number of factoriesowned by the Government will become available for civilian work. It is timelythat we should consider, as a part of our plans for the switch-over of industry from war to peace, the principles to be followed in disposing of these factories.I have discussed this question with the Ministers primarily concerned, andwe are agreed in submitting the following recommendations to the War Cabinet.2. At this stage, it will be sufficient if a policy is approved for the disposalof those factories which are likely to become available between the end ofhostilities in Europe and the end of the war with Japan. The conditions governing supply and demand for factories will in this period differ considerably from those which are likely to prevail at a later stage. We therefore suggestthat for the present we should confine our attention to the nearer problem,without prejudging the policy which it may ultimately be thought- desirableto adopt.3.   Two major points of principle call for settlement:-,(a) Should the factories be -disposed of to the highest bidder, or should they be allocated by the Government according to broader social andeconomic criteria?(b) Should the factories normally be sold outright or merely rented to the approved applicant ?4. Competitive Bidding or Allocation. The case for allocation rather thancompetitive bidding is strong. During this early period there.will undoubtedly be a shortage of suitable factory premises. Unless suitable control is exercised,therefore, competition might force prices to artificially high levels and result inour limited factory space being devoted to less essential purposes. During thisperiod of scarcity we should regard the controlled allocation of government factories as merely one aspect of the general policy laid down in the white paper on Employment Policy of meeting our more urgent civilian and exportdemands first. To that end we recommend that the responsible department should dispose of available factories according to certain criteria of which themost important would be (a) The establishment of a balanced distribution of industry;(b) The re-establishment and expansion of the export trade;(c) The maintenance of a war potential;(d\ The requirements of town and country planning;(e) The ability of individual applicants for factories to make efficient use ofthe factory premises with the minimum of reconstruction; and(/) The claims, on grounds of equity, of firms whose factories have been damaged or destroyed by enemy action or have been requisitioned bythe State under concentration schemes or otherwise.5.   Outright Sale or Lease Although we do not think it necessary to lay down any hard and fast rule, we consider that during this period there should bea bias towards the leasing of Government factories&quot; rather than their outright[27789]/ Copy No,
sale. This policy.would make it possible for smaller firms, of proved capacity, toobtain premises &quot;without an outlay which might strain their resources or whittledown their working capital. And it would leave for future consideration thedecision as to the best manner of disposing finally of these factories. We thinkit desirable, however, that, where a lease is granted, the tenant should, if he sowishes, be given an option to purchase at the end of the lease at a value to beagreed, or settled by arbitration, in the light of the conditions then ruling.Otherwise the tenant might well find himself hampered in preparing long-termplans for development.6. Administration. The disposal of Government factories is one importantinstrument for carrying into effect the intentions of the Government to secure amore balanced distribution of industry throughout the country. We therefore recommend that the administrative machinery, both at the Ministerial and at theofficial level, outlined in paragraph 30 of the White Paper on Employment policy for formulating, supervising and executing the general policy for the distributionof industry should also be used for determining questions of principle which arise in connection with the &quot;disposal of Government factories.7. I therefore submit, for the approval of the War Cabinet, the following recommendations on points of principle in regard to the disposal of Government-owned factories which are likely to become available between the end of hostilities in Europe and the end of the war with Japan (a) That the Government should dispose of factories by a system of selectionon criteria such as those outlined in paragraph 4 above.(b) That a policy of leasing should be the normal procedure for the disposalof factories, but that this procedure need not be strictly adhered to where a chosen applicant expressed a preference for outright purchaseor where there appeared to be other satisfactory grounds for directsale. Further, where a lease is granted, the tenant should normally be given the right to acquire an option to purchase at the end of the lease at a value to be agreed or settled by arbitration at that time.(c) That the Ministerial Committee to be set up to control the developmentof the policy for a balanced distribution of industry should also beresponsible for determining general questions of policy relating tothe disposal of Government factories.(d) That the responsibility for selecting the occupier of a given factory,when finally released, for civilian use, and of defending that selectionshould rest with the Board of Trade, who would bring into consulta-tion, before making any final decision, all other interested departments.(e) That, at an appropriate time, when through the administrative machinerysuggested under (c) and id) the proposed system of Operation has been worked out in greater detail, a statement should be made in Parliamentexplaining the basis on which the disposal of Government-ownedfactories will proceed.W.4 Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,7th July, 1944.
