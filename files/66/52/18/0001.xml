THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET. GopvW.P. (44) 363.3rd July, 1944.    -WAR CABINET.THE STERLING PROBLEM.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.UP to the year 1931 we lived under the so-called automatic monetary systembased on gold, a commodity over whose total production and value we exercisedno control and which we could only acquire or retain&apos; out Of the surplus of our trade or by methods restrictive of our economic expansion. It was in terms ofthat commodity that in the last war we incurred our debt to the United States.Its repayment would have been a heavy burden in any case. We made itpractically impossible, both by overvaluing our currency when we linked up again to the gold standard in 1925, and by our adherence-to a system of unselectivefree imports under which we bought from the United States  100 million a yearmore than they bought from us. So we defaulted, ignominiously. More than that;we in fact made it impossible to pay our way-at all, and in 1931 we were drivenoff the gold standard let us hope for good and all.Meanwhile, on the assumption that British sterling was always in the last resort convertible into gold, we had built up an exchange system which coverednot only our own Empire, but not a small part of the world outside. When wewent off gold in 1931 we suddenly discovered, to our surprise, that the assumption of gold convertibilitjr on which the Sterling Area had originally been built upwas quite superfluous. Sterling, based essentially on our reputation forhonesty and sound finance, revealed itself as a self-contained measure of value,practically as good as gold in the range of products which it could secure and far better than gold in the fact that its volume and consequently its value could be adjusted to meet the needs of production and trade. Released from gold and from our free import inhibitions, and helped by practical mutual trade agree-ments within and without the Empire, we made a rapid recovery. To quote thatremarkable survey of the inter-war years, &quot; The United States in the world economy &quot; (p. 194) : &apos;&apos; In general, the most successful adaptation was achieved by countries that depreciated their currencies and thereafter were able to pursue policies of monetary ease or to adopt more positive measures of economic expansionwithout the necessity of defending rigid gold parities. The members of the sterling bloc were, on the whole, outstanding. They not only attained, forthe most part, their pre-depression levels of production and income by 1935,but also maintained virtually complete exchange stability among themselves,once the realinement of their currency ratios had been made during thedepression, without depending on exchange controls or other intricatemeasures of direct intervention in the trading mechanism.&quot;What does not seem to have been generally realised is the extent to whichthe existence of the sterling system has enabled us to pay our way in the present war. Thanks to American Lease-Lend, Canadian Mutual Aid and the sale of 1,000 million or so of foreign assets, we look like emerging from this war withcomparatively little external debt of the kind incurred in the last war, Le., theobligation to find very large amounts of gold or other foreign currency. For therest we have paid for our needs, apart from our domestic expenditure, by theissue of sterling to the tune of nearly  3,000 million up to date, likely to be well[27727]
over  4,000 million by the time the war is over. This is not an obligation to finddefinite amounts of gold or foreign currencies which we have not got and mustsomehow earn. It is, in the last resort, like our domestic debt, only an obligationto print or find Treasury notes. The chief difference between the two is that inthe case of our domestic debt we have first drawn the money from the public inorder to pay it out for war purposes, meanwhile paying interest for its use;in the other case, we have had the goods and services first and are now payinginterest, mostly at 1 per cent., on the accumulating money which, for various reasons, the countries concerned have not been in a position to realise and turninto other goods and services. In either case the holders have a claim at largeupon the goods and services of the whole community, or, indeed, of the sterling area as a whole, which gives to their claim the character of a tangible asset.In the case of India, for instance, we have drawn upon her for vast amounts of tea. jute, hides, manganese, &amp;c, as well as for military equipment of every kind. Payment has only accumulated here, and is temporarily held in sterling-credits, because the shortage of shipping, as well as the pre-occupation of our industries with war production, has prevented India from using it to satisfy the needs of her consumers. Where there were assets here,available for purchase and not requiring shipping, in the shape of some  310 million of Indian Govern-ment or Indian railway securities, she took payment in cash, and used it in whatseemed to her the most profitable manner under the circumstances. The rest she has held in reserve against her currency issue.In this connection it is necessary to keep clearly in mind the actual methodby which and to whom payment is made under the sterling system. The sterlingwe pay out at this end is not paid to Governments but to the Reserve Banks orother currency authorities, who hold it in reserve against their own currencies,which they then issue locally to a corresponding amount in payment for the goods and services rendered. The amount thus held varies from 40 per cent, of theissue in the case of India* to 100 per cent, in the case of the Colonial CurrencyBoards. The point is one which should not be left out of sight when it is argued that the local currency inflation, in India and elsewhere, has unduly enhanced theprice of the goods and services we have obtained. For it means that an appreciablepart of the sterling payments we make will remain locked up in reserve unlessthose currencies are drastically deflated, or the sterling system itself breaks up.As for the remainder, the real problem, as the above analysis has shown, willnot be how to find the money with which to discharge a debt, but how to make sure that the spending of that money by its recipients after the war shall notdamage our financial structure or frustrate our efforts to balance our trade byexcessive immediate calls upon us for goods and services without an equivalentreturn in essential imports. The problem is undoubtedly serious, but I do notbelieve it need be insuperable.The first essential condition to the satisfactory solution of the problem isto maintain that confidence in the sterling system upon which the whole of our financial future depends. Anything that savours of repudiation or, indeed, ofsuggesting that we owre a debt which we cannot or do not intend to discharge infull could only have disastrous effects on a financial system whose wholefoundation is psychological. On the contrary, our attitude throughout should bethat there is no question as to payment, but only how to see to it, in the interestof all concerned, that the value of the payment which we make should not be impaired or destroyed by the unwise action of any of us.The chief danger with which we shall be confronted in that regard will bethe eagerness of sterling-holding countries to meet their immediate requirementsboth in capital and in consumer goods outside the Sterling Area if we are not ina position to meet all their urgent demands. As a long-term policy the freenegotiability of sterling is, indeed, one of its most valuable features. But in theimmediate post-wrar position anything like a wholesale unloading of sterling onto the outside market would seriously depreciate its value. This would obviously be against the interests of all concerned, here and throughout the Sterling Area.Holders of sterling would do themselves an ill deal if, for the sake of satisfying,out of part of their assets, some immediately convenient demand, they therebyseriously reduced the value of the rest of their holding. But this is&apos;precisely what will happen, unless definite measures to prevent it are agreed upon and* This is the obligatory minimum. In fact India has been holding more than twice that amount and could convert the excess into long term securities bearing higher interest if HisMajesty&apos;s Government allowed. The orderly disposal of this excess may prove one of themost difficult points to settle.
loogenerally enforced. It is most important that there should be agreement not onlyin order to facilitate enforcement, but also because a unilateral blocking of sterling by ourselves, to such extent as we can carry it out, would tend to shakeconfidence in sterling itself.Lord Keynes has suggested, as a solution of this difficulty, limiting purchases(and presumably investment) outside the Sterling Area, for the first few years,to the current earnings of each Sterling Area country outside the area, plus asmall additional ration at our discretion, to be followed by a relaxation whichwould cover all current earnings, and eventually by a removal of all restrictions.This is no doubt asking a great deal from those holders of Sterling, like India, whohave during the war earned large amounts in dollars which have been turnedover to us on our undertaking to supply them with the foreign currency they maywant for imports. But it is clearly in their own long-term interest. WhatLord Keynes&apos; memorandum has not made clear is that, if the agreement is to be fair and acceptable, that limitation must apply to the United Kingdom as well.The right solution of the problem of agreed control may, indeed, lie in setting up some Committee or Council, to supervise the use of sterling during the transitionyears, on which the principal sterling currency authorities should be representedtogether with the Bank of England.The advantage of such a scheme as proposed by Lord Keynes, if carried into effect, would be very great to all concerned. While the sterling-holdingcountries are naturally anxious to meet their urgent reconstruction needs as fully as possible, they have no interest, apart from that, in depleting theirholding. They have also, most of them, export industries which will be anxiousto maintain or enlarge their activities after the war and which, so far as theyare concerned, will be just as glad to sell in the Sterling Area as outside. Inother words, Lord Keynes&apos; policy, providing always that the United Kingdomalso plays its part, will put sterling-holding countries in the favourable positionof only having those holdings reduced by the excess of their imports over their exports as within the Sterling Area.From our own point of view we shall, after the war, be in a position of theutmost difficulty in covering our essential import requirements by our exports.But the difficulty is really only one in relation to our imports from outside the sterling Area. Imports from within the Sterling Area need not create an exchange problem so long as the other sterling countries retain their confidence in sterling; as an asset of permanent value. So lon^ as that confidence holds such imports need involve nothing more than an addition to existing sterling balances in partial set off against the reduction of those balances by United kingdom exports to the Sterling Area. The limitation which Lord Keynes has suggestedis one which in our own narrower interest we shall have to impose on ourselves,quite apart from its forming a necessary part of any general Sterling Areaagreement.It must always be kept in mind that the Sterling Area is not made up merely of a series of bilateral monetary agreements between this country and the various members of the area. Sterling is a universal medium of exchange for the whole area. India&apos;s sterling balances are just as available for purchases from australia or Africa as from the United Kingdom. So long as confidence in sterling ismaintained a considerable part of the sterling we have issued in return for goods and services will not only remain locked up in currency reserves, but will remainin circulation to cover the mutual trade of the whole area.So far as currency reserves are concerned it will be necessary, in view of thelarge amounts involved and the fact that they have arisen out of abnormal war expenditure, to come to some equitable arrangement, both as regards&quot; theirtoo rapid reduction and as regards the maximum rate of interest to be paid.On the other hand there is no sufficient reason for restricting private investment by sterling holders outside this country in either British gilt-edged securitiesor British equities. The effect in the former case would presumably be to sendup the price of these securities, help to keep down the rate of interest and liberatecapital at home for industrial purposes. But -the temptation to the purchaserswould be effectively limited by our high income tax rates. The same limiting-factor would apply to outside sterling investment in United Kingdom equitiesand prevent it going beyond the point where it could dangerously affect thecontrol of British industry.There is a tendency to contrast what the United States and Canada havedone by way of Lease-Lend and Mutual Aid, with the attitude of the otherDominions and India which have been paid in sterling for the goods and services
they have supplied to the common cause over and above their own individual war effort. But it will be evident from the above analysis of the situation that, infact, they will have also given a substantial contribution by accepting as paymentvast quantities of our paper (or obligation to pay our paper) under conditionswhich imply that a considerable part of that paper is never likely to be redeemedand that most of the rest will be devoted to stimulating the trade of this countryand of the rest of the Empire. So far, indeed, from reckoning our outstandingsterling as an intolerable debt to be resented we should make up our minds to convert it into an opportunity which we can exploit a guarantee of assuredtrade to help our post-war reconstruction and employment, the value of which wecan prolong to the extent to which we postpone its liquidation by continuing to buy within the Sterling Area ourselves. It all depends on our ability to persuade the holders of sterling to extend into the transition period the confidence in sterling which they have shown during the war.There is, however, one consequence of this situation which we must face,unless we wish, not only to throw away the opportunity thus presented to us, butalso to incur the gravest financial embarrassment and loss of prestige. We cannot afford, at any rate during a considerable transition period, to enter upon anycommercial or monetary agreements with the outside world which could limit inany way our freedom to restrict purchases from outside the Sterling Area or could hamper the functioning of the Sterling System by tying it up prematurely,as regards either exchange or capital investment^ with any international monetaryarrangement.L.
