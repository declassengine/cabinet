NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Unfavourable weather and enemy minelaying have hindered unloadingin the assault area in Normandy.Coastal forces have fought a number of successful engagements in theChannel.U.S. carrier-borne aircraft and warships have attacked Japanese bases inthe Bonin Islands.U-boat activity in the Indian Ocean has somewhat increased.Four U-boats have been sunk and one probably sunk.Home Waters.2. Minelaying by enemy aircraft and unfavourable weather have continuedto impede unloading in the assault area. Strong south-westerly winds havedelayed landing ^craft convoys and hindered minesweeping. The Ouistrehambeach sector has been largely abandoned for unloading- purposes owing topersistent enemy shellfire. Discharge at Arromanches has steadily increased during the week as progress was made with the facilities there. The following-are the cumulative totals unloaded in both British and U.S. sectors up to p.m.on the 4th : 958,536 men, 183,540 vehicles and 649,568 tons of stores.3. On the 30th H.M.S. Rodney bombarded two important enemy concentra-tions at St. Andre-sur-Orne and Fouguerolles, and other enemy targets w^ereengaged by H.M. cruisers A rgonaut and Belfast.4. On the night of the lst/2nd M.T.Bs. torpedoed an enemy landing craftin an eastbound convoy off Havre and later had an inconclusive engagement withE-boats in the same area. Early on the 4th H.M. frigates Stayner andThornborough probably damaged two E-boats, and on the following night M.T.Bs.damaged a minesweeper off Cap cl&apos;Antifer. M.T.Bs. engaged nine E/R-boats off Havre; of these two were torpedoed and sunk and a third damaged by gunfire.5. Early on the 4th four M.T.Bs. engaged an enemy convoy approachingSt. Malo. Two ships were torpedoed and sunk and others were damaged by gunfire. Two M.T.Bs. sustained minor damage and five casualties. Anotherforce of M.T.Bs. fought an inconclusive action with five enemy ships off Jersey.On the following- night H.M. destroyers Tartar and Ashanti damaged four guncoasters, which made their escape into Lannion, on the coast of Brittany.6. On the night of the 3rd/4th M.T.Bs. sank a minesweeper off Vlieland. and on the following night M.T.Bs. attacked a convoy off Ijmuiden; a trawlerwas sunk, a landing craft probably sunk and another trawler and a landing craft were damaged by gunfire. One M.T.B. was lost and three others damaged. later the convoy^was attacked by Beaufighters of Coastal Command, which probablytorpedoed an escort vessel and damaged seven others.7. H.M.C.S. Port Colborne (frigate) was damaged during anti-submarineoperations south-east of Portland on the 29th, and H.M. destroyers Eskimo andJavelin were damaged in collision off Ushant on the 2nd. H.M.S. EmpireBroadsivord (L.S.I.) was mined and sunk in the western assault area on the 2nd.Other casualties are given in Appendix V.Mediterranean.8. On the 30th the port of Piombino camp, into use as an advanced Alliedbase on the coast of Tuscany, and berths for landing ships and craft are now available. On that day 1,000 tons of ammunition and stores were landed tosupport the front line troops, and after three more days of salvage work theamount discharged had increased to more than 4,000 tons daily.On the night of the 29th/30th U.S. coastal forces damaged two E-boats north of Elba and took 14 prisoners. One of these boats, identified as the ItalianM.A.S. 562, was later towed into Bastia.9. On the night of the 23rd/24th a small U.S. force was landed on thesouth side of the Peljesac peninsula on the Dalmatian coast. An enemy convoy was engaged; one schooner was sunk, an E-boat was damaged and two prisoners were taken. During the night the 29th/30th H.M. destroyers Terpsichore,Tumult and Tenacious bombarded the look-out station south of Valona (Albania),
and troops, who were landed later, demolished the station and captured someprisoners. Coastal forces off the Dalmatian coast sank a lighter, possibly sankanother and damaged a Siebel Ferry.10. On the 23rd H.M. S/M Unswerving sank two patrol vessels in the^aegean and H.M. S/M Vampire sank three caiques and damaged three others.East Indies.11. On the 27th H.M. S/M Clyde shelled the barracks on Ross Island,Port Blair, in the Andamans, and H.M. S/M Tradewind shelled oil cisterns atSibolga on the north-west coast of Sumatra; 16 Javanese and Sumatran prisoners were captured for interrogation.Pacific.12. On the night of the 25th/26th and on the following night Japanesetorpedo and light bombers unsuccessfully attacked U.S. carriers which were operating off the marinas.On the 2nd U.S. carrier-borne aircraft and warships attacked Japanese bases at Ffaha and Iwo in the Bonins. Three enemy destroyers were sunk or beachedand another was seriously damaged; a large cargo ship and a tanker were sunk and several small ships were damaged.During the week upwards of 31 barges have been destroyed off theNew Guinea coast by light coastal forces and aircraft.On the 1st U.S. light forces shelled enemy positions hear Kavieng and onthe south-west coast of New Ireland.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. On the 30th a U-boat was sunk by aircraft north of the Shetlands. Onthe 3rd U.S.S. Croaten (escort carrier) sank one off Madeira. On the 5thH.M. ships Wanderer (destroyer) and Tavy (frigate) sank one off Barfleur,and U.S.S. Card (escort carrier) sank another south of Newfoundland.H.M.S. Essington (frigate) in conjunction with aircraft probably sank one south-east of Plymouth on the 30th.14. During June 132 attacks were made, of which 90 were by shore-based aircraft, 37 by warships and five by carrier-borne aircraft. Thirteen U-boatshave been sunk, 11 probably sunk and three possibly sunk.Enemy Intelligence.15. The Scheer, lutzow and Prince Eugen, with the 6-inch cruisersNitrnberg, Leipzig and Emden, have recently carried out intensive exercises inthe Baltic.  Hipper was seen in the floating dock at Gydnia on the 4th.Heavily protected shelters for 76 E- and R-boats are at present availablein Channel ports from Ijmuiden to Havre.U-boats.16.   There has been slightly less U-boat activity in the English Channel.One Japanese and three German U-boats are operating in the Indian Oceansouth-west of Ceylon and two German U-boats are patrolling between Capetownand Madagascar.A considerable force of 50 or more U-boats is probably still based in Norway.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked three ships, ofwhich two are known to have sunk. A U.S. ship was sunk south-east of AdduAtoll and a Dutch ship south-east of Freetown. A U.S. tanker was torpedoedoff Panama. Belated reports indicate that two other ships have recently been sunk in the Indian Ocean, probably by U-boat.In the Channel operations six ships in convoys to and from the assault area were either mined or torpedoed; one of these sank and one ship was mined inthe U.S. assault area.A homeward-bound convoy was unsuccessfully attacked by six F.W. 200 offthe west coast of Portugal.[27763] b
18. Provisional shipping losses by enemy action during June were36,000 tons. Eight ships totalling 21,105 tons were sunk in the Channeloperations.Protection of Seaborne Trade.19. During the week ending the 2nd, 877 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 441 were in ocean convoys and436 in British coastal convoys.Two escort carriers, 36 destroyers (including 17 U.S. destroyers) and75 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties. Fivehome-bound convoys consisting of 174 ships and five outward-bound convoysconsisting of 267 ships reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.20.   No minelaying by surface craft was reported during the week.Aircraft have laid mines off the west coast of Denmark, the Dutch coast andBiscay ports.Mines have been laid in the Danube, in the iEgean and off Formosa.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.- 21. Minelaying by enemy aircraft at night persists in the assault area.On the night of the&apos; 28th/29th five enemy aircraft engaged in minelaying were shot down by gunfire from H.M. ships. In the eastern sector 55 ground mines have been destroyed during the week. Up to the 27th a total of 237 ground mines were destroyed in the eastern and western sectors, while 102 were self-detonated.During the same period 95 moored mines were destroyed in the eastern sector and 78 in the western sector.A channel has been established from the Needles to Cherbourg, and Alliedminesweepers are clearing Cherbourg harbour where a large number of different types of mines have been encountered. Six moored mines have been destroyedoff the Eddystone.No minelaying is suspected by enemy aircraft in Home Waters.22. Minesweeping operations to clear the west coast of Italy channelscontinue, and 13 moored mines have been destroyed near Civitavecchia. A channelhas been established from this port to Piombino.The mine totals are 4,972 ground and 5,184 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. During the period the 1st to 15th June ten enemy, ships (29,509 tons)were sunk, captured or became constructive losses; of these, four, totalling10,945 tons, were lost in the Mediterranean. Four ships (12,017) were seriously damaged.24. It is reported that, shipments of Swedish ore to enemy Europe haveshown a considerable decrease in 1944 in comparison with the correspondingperiod in 1943. The largest decrease was during May, when imports from Swedenamounted to 420,000 tons compared with 1,312,000 tons in May 1943. Reductionin this traffic may be partially attributed to the Allied mining of the Baltic andof the Kiel canal.25. About nine schooners are employed by the enemy for traffic betweenTrieste and the Dalmatian coast. There are 13 wooden motor vessels of about300 tons in various stages of completion in the yards at Trieste, Pirano, Rovignoand Lussin Piccolo. The shipyard at Monfalcone has been considerably damaged by bombing.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Gampaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.26. There has been little change in the Viipuri area, but between the LakesOnega and Lagoda the Russians have advanced steadily westwards and north-wards.   They have clearecj all the western shore of Lake Onega, with the result
5224that the whole of the railway Leningrad-Murmansk is now in their hands, andthey have advanced more than half way along the north-eastern shore of lake ladoga.Central Sector.27. The Russian advance in the Central Sector continues with undiminishedspeed on a front of some 250 miles. The most significant event of the week wasthe occupation of Minsk, which the Germans apparently made no special effort to hold. A stronghold which the Germans defended more stubbornly was Polotsk,which fell on the 5th, some days after the Russians had by-passed it from thesouth. Russian troops are now within 50 miles of Lithuania and some 150 miles of East Prussia.Kotvel Sector.28. The Germans announced on the 5th that they had evacuated Kowelso as to carry out a local shortening of the front.General.29. Along the whole of the Central sector the Russians have advanced atan average speed of about 15 miles a day. This compares with the followingspeeds achieved by the Germans on various sectors in July 1941, before theRussians had had time to organise their resistance : Northern Sector  ...      ...      ...      ...      15 miles per day.Central Sector    ...      ...      ...       ...      13 miles per day.Southern Sector  ...      ...      ...      ...      11 miles per day.These rates fell to 3, 4 and 10 miles a day during August.The corresponding figures for the three German armies engaged in the offensive launched at the end of June 1942 were :  July 1942     .........      13, 12^ and 9 miles per day.August 1942 .........      10, 3 and 1\ miles per day.It should be noted that during July the Russians were carrying out a strategicwithdrawal.The speed of the Russian advance has apparently prevented the germans from carrying out any extensive demolitions. This is indicated, for instance, bythe fact that the Russians were using the railway station at Borisov within two days of capturing the town.North-West France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.30. During the past week the main developments in the fighting inNormandy have been concentrated in two sectors. In the Cherbourg Peninsula,U.S. forces, which had earlier completed the mopping up of enemy resistance inthe area of Cap de la Hague, started an offensive on the 3rd southwards from the base of the Peninsula in the direction of La Haye du Puits, where street fightingis now in progress. At the other end of the front, British forces over the week-endrepulsed a series of sharp counter-attacks against their bridgehead across theRiver Odon and on the 4th launched a new attack west of Caen where theysecured some new gains on the approaches to the town.U.S. Sector.31. At the beginning of the week elements of the enemy&apos;s forces were.still holding out in isolated forts and in the arsenal in Cherbourg, on an airfield some-7 miles east of the town and in scattered pockets in the north-west tip of the peninsula. These remnants were steadily mopped up and all resistance was finally overcome on the morning of the 1st July.Clearance parties and minesweepers started work in the port of Cherbourgas soon as fire from the enemy batteries to the north-west had ceased. Reportsstate that the harbour has been heavily mined and the demolitions to the port facilities have been as extensive and thorough as was expected. It is, however,anticipated that it will be possible at an early date to make considerable use of thesheltered waters by unloading over the beaches, pending the restoration of the harbour facilities. Certain quays and docks are also expected to be available inthe near future. The small port of St. Vaast on the east coast of the Peninsulais being rapidly cleared and will be of considerable value.[27763] b 2
Meanwhile U.S. forces had been re-grouping in preparation for future opera-tions in the south of the Peninsula and on the morning of the 3rd they starteda three-pronged offensive southwards from the base of the Peninsula in the direc-tion of La Haye du Puits. The attack, which was on about a 15-mile front betweenPortbail and Carentan, made steady progress, and, by the 5th, U.S. forces were fighting in the streets of La Haye du Puits, where they had captured the railway station, and had also made limited advances astride the Carentan-Periers road.Opposition, which consists of the remnants of the enemy divisions cut in two bythe original drive across the Peninsula, strengthened by the bulk of a freshinfantry division sent up from Brittany, has gradually stiffened since the attackopened/ In addition, the enclosed nature of the country and the bad weather in which the offensive was begun have contributed to make the going difficult.Nevertheless, steady progress continues.British Sector.32. By the 28th June British forces pressing forward their strong offensivethrust S.E. of Tilly sur Seulles had succeeded in establishing a bridgehead some4,000 yards wide and 2.000 yards deep across the River Odon. Armoured forcesthen further enlarged this bridgehead by pushing on against stiff enemy resistance towards the high ground south of the river, while at the same timenorth of the river our infantry were engaged in steadily eliminating enemy strong-points which had been by-passed in the original drive&apos; to the River Odon.The enemy was compelled to throw in strong armoured reserves in an attemptto stem this advance and over the week-end launched a series of sharp counter-attacks, which were specially severe against the western flank of our salient.These attacks were in general completely repulsed and many of them were broken up by artillery fire before they could reach our forward positions. In result,while our positions remain firmly intact, the enemy has incurred serious losses in infantry and armour and. in his efforts to plug the gaps in his defences, hasbeen forced to use piecemeal the armoured reserves, which he hoped to retainfor a concerted counter-attack at a time and place of his own choosing.On the morning of the 4th July British and Canadian forces launched a newattack west of Caen. Canadian forces quickly succeeded in capturing Carpiquet(4 miles W.N.W. of Caen) while due south British forces moving from the easternflank of the Odon bridgehead advanced several miles to enter the village ofVerson (4 miles W.S.W. of Caen) and join up with the Canadian forces on theirleft, Very severe close-quarter fighting, however, developed for the possession ofan airfield just south of Carpiquet, where the enemy are at present still holding out. Further south the British forces which had occupied Verson withdrew onthe 5th to their original positions. The area vacated, however, is still coveredby our patrols.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)33. The enemy&apos;s delaying stand in the Trasimeno area has been brokenthrough, after some 14 days&apos; fighting. The enemy is now withdrawing slowlynorth of the lake, maintaining a coherent line and on the whole disengagingsuccessfully.   The whole movement here is deliberate and orderly.In the Adriatic sector, Polish forces pushed forward from the Chienti River,where they had been held up, at the beginning of the week and advanced over thePotenza to take Recanati and, by the 5th, Osimo. As a result of this progress,we are now less than 10 miles from Ancona. Inland, another Polish division and the Italian Corps of Liberation have been advancing in conformity.Further to the west, the armoured car regiment on the right flank of thecentral Corps of Eighth Army, has thrust forward into the mountainous areaNorth of Camerino, which was found clear of the enemy on the 1st, and by thelatest reports, are now some miles beyond Matelica. They are in touch with thePolish Corps to their right so that the whole of this flank is now covered.The central Corps of Eighth Army has been advancing slowly northwardsfrom Perugia. On the 30th June, the town of Magione, halfway up the easternshore of Lake Trasimeno, was found to be clear of the enemy, and on the2nd July, M. Fezio, a dominant feature 6 miles south of Umbertide, fell to us.The following day, armoured cars moving round the north shore of the lake,made contact with the left-hand Corps of Eighth Army on the road to Arezzo,and thus the lake was completely covered by our forces. By the morning of the6th, forward troops had regained contact with the enemy 3 miles north ofUmbertide. &apos;
n n i&apos;C*   -JThe left hand Corps of Eighth Army, fighting forward against very stiffresistance, advanced slowly north-westwards from Lake Trasimeno, capturingFojano on the 2nd, and Cortona the next day. By the 5th, forward troops, in contact with the enemy along their whole front, were less than 4 miles S.W, ofArezzo, while the left flank of the Corps was about 5 miles N.E. of Siena.Fifth Army has had a slightly easier task, in that resistance has on thewhole not been so stiff. The French Corps entered Siena without i-esistance onthe 3rd, and advanced, north-west of the city in the subsequent days, in close contact with the enemy. Further west the U.S. Corps, after some stiff armoured fighting south of Saline, thrust forward until by the end of the period they werejust south of Volterra. Meanwhile the infantry division on the left foughtfiercely for the town of Cecina which it had cleared by the morning of the 2nd,crossing the River Cecina at the same time. From then on, they have met withextremely stiff resistance, and latest reports speak of fierce fighting in progress inRosignano, a village about 5 miles north of Cecina.Yugoslavia.34. The Partisans have continued their activities in Serbia. They have captured the town of Brus (40 miles west of Nis) from Serb Quisling troops andare fighting Bulgarian columns in the area some 25 miles south of Nis.The Germans are still attempting to liquidate groups of Partisans in WesternBosnia. They attacked Grahovo (40 miles north of Sibenik) on the 25th of Junewith a force of 1,600 supported by tanks. They entered, the town but were laterdriven out.On the 21st of June a Partisan force landed on the island of Korcula andambushed an enemy column; they claim to have killed 200 Germans. AnotherPartisan force which landed the same day on Brae claims to have killed20 Germans and wounded 17.Greece.Operations against the enemy.35. The guerrillas have taken the initiative against the enemy in North-West Greece. On the 27th June E.L.A.S. attacked 500 German troops moving-south towards Kastoria. On the same day Zervas supported by U.S. troopsovercame the garrison of Paramythia (20 miles S.W. of Yannina) and on the30th occupied the port of Parga. Zervas forces successfully repulsed counter-attacks against Paramythia, killing 70 Germans.Political.36. Skirmishes took place on the 19th June between E.L.A.S. and Zervasforces in the Epirus. Zervas counter-attacked and the fighting died down bythe 28th. It now appears that E.A.M. provoked the incident in order to throwthe blame on Zervas for political reasons. .Burma.37. During the past week our troops have been advancing on the village of Ukhrul, 35 miles N.E. of Imphal, an important track junction through whichpassed the Japanese Lines of Communication for their troops astride theImphal-Kohima road.   Ukhrul was captured by our troops on the 3rd.Native troops under our command have occupied Fort Harrison (Sadon)30 miles east of Myitkyina.Pacific Theatre.New Guinea.38. Australian troops advancing along the north-east coast of New. Guineahave reached the mouth of the Sepik River (half-way between Madang andAitape) without encountering any considerable opposition.marinas.39. On Saipan Island, U.S. troops have made further advances and havecleared the Japanese who were holding out in the area of Nafutan Point.Schouten Islands.40.   Organised enemy resistance on Biak Island has ceased.
Noemfoor Island.41. On the 2nd July, U.S. troops landed on Noemfoor Island, 100 miles west of Biak Island. The movement was an amphibious one and troops wentashore through surf under cover of naval guns and air bombardment. Theoriginal landing force has since been reinforced by paratroops, and U.S. troops have established a strong perimeter around Kamiri airfield, which they had occupied by the 4th July. They are also reducing Japanese defended positionseastwards along the coast.AIR SITUATION.General Review.42.   Bad weather severely hampered air operations over the Western front.Enemy attacks on the United Kingdom with flying-bombs were maintained on an increasing scale. A heavy scale of effort was directed against the sites and supply dumps in Northern France.In Italy, enemy communications were successfully attacked. Heavy bombers of the M.A.A.F. carried out attacks on oil refineries and installations, and railway centres in the Balkans and South France.United Kingdom.43. No enemy aircraft were reported over this country. Flying bomb attacks are reported in paragraphs 63-66.Home Waters.44. During the week aircraft of Coastal Command flew 744 sorties involving6,361 flying hours.Mosquitoes and Beaufighters made a number of successful day attacks on enemy shipping. On the 29th&quot;, a 1,500-ton tanker and five of its six escort vessels were damaged off Lorient; on the 30th, a stationary convoy consisting of a2,500-ton ship, a small tanker and two minesweepers were attacked off the BrestPeninsula, and the ship, the tanker and one of the minesweepers were last seen on fire; on the 3rd, a 900-ton ship and an armed trawler, also off the Brestpeninsula, were damaged and. on the 4th, two trawlers were set on fire offLa Pallice.By night, about 100 aircraft, mostly operating individually, attacked small ships off the north-west coast of France; although results were largely unobserved,one E-boat and a possible M-class minesweeper were sunk, three minsweepers, twotrawlers and three E-boats were set on fire, and at least four other E-boats were damaged. One E-boat was destroyed, by day, by Typhoons operating off Le Treport.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 35 were despatched, laid 136 sea-mines.Western Front.45. The weather, which was consistently bad throughout the week, caused a further severe reduction in the number of sorties despatched from Commandsin this country. The total, some 7,000 less than for the previous week, is 23,185sorties, of which 13,065 were flown by the A.E.A.F., 5,981 by the Eighth U.S.Air Force and 4,139 by Bomber Command. The tonnage of bombs released was21,319, of which 15,368 were dropped by Bomber Command. In the week, theAllied losses were 158 aircraft, of which 72 were heavy bombers, 15 medium and light bombers, and 71 fighters and fighter-bombers. The enemy casualties, in combat and on the ground, were 223 destroyed, 18 probably destroyed, and 120damaged.&apos;*France and the Low Countries.46. The main weight of effort was directed against flying-bomb supply andlaunching sites which were attacked on nine occasions with a, total of9,989 tons of bombs from 2,324 aircraft, these aircraft being almost entirely heavy,bombers of the Eighth U.S. Air Force and Bomber Command. Several well-concentrated attacks were delivered, particularly on supply sites at Domleger andBeauvoir (Pas de Calais), St. Martin L&apos;Hortier and Biennais (Dieppe/Rouen* The results of som* of the attacks referred to above are given in Appendix VII.
area), and on two large sites at Watten and Wizernes (Pas de Calais); in additiona supply dump 15 miles north of Paris is believed to have been well hit. Foursmall-scale raids were made on launching site headquarters.About; 3,300 tons of bombs were dropped on road and rail targets, the fourheaviest attacks, each of about 600 tons, being made at night by Lancasters andHalifaxes, the objectives being the railway centres at Vierzon (near Bourges),Orleans/Les&quot;Aubrais, Villeneuve St. Georges (Paris) and Dijon; it is probablethat all four attacks were effective. A successful night operation by light bombers of the A.E.A.F. resulted in damaging attacks on 23 trains.Fighters and fighter-bombers on armed reconnaissances, despite the handicapof bad weather, inflicted considerable damage on road and rail transport, mostlybehind the battle area; 170 M.T., 108 railway wagons and 66 locomotives were destroyed and over 500 similar units were damaged. A number of bridges were either destroyed or damaged.The only large-scale operations against airfields were made, through cloud, byFortresses and Liberators, which dropped 996 tons on 16 targets in Holland,Belgium and France.On the 30th, about 1,100 tons of bombs were dropped by Halifaxes andLancasters in an attack, considered to have been successful, on a concentration oftroops and armour near Villers Bocage. Other effective operations, mainly by medium and fighter-bombers, included raids on fuel dumps at Conde sur Vire, aradio station at Chartres, flak positions at Les Ancleiys and, by 19 Fortresses, on azinc factory near Eindhoven (Holland).The G.A.F. effort over the battle area averaged about 350 fighter sorties byclay and 50 minelaying sorties by night, the latter operating off the Normandybeachhead. In addition, on the night of the 4th/5th about 45 aircraft operated with torpedoes and radio-controlled bombs against Allied shipping in the same area.Germany..*47. The only large-scale operation was carried out on the 29th by Fortressesand Liberators against targets in the Brunswick/Magdeburg/Leipzig area, wherea total of 1,233 tons of bombs was dropped on seven aircraft and aero-engineworks, a synthetic oil plant, an M.T. works and a ball-bearing factory; resultsvaried, but were very good at the aircraft assembly works at Oschersleben andBernberg. In addition, 269 tons were dropped on five airfields and three railway centres. Enemy casualties by the bombers and by the 685 fighters whichco-operated were 53 destroyed and 17 damaged; 15 heavy bombers and threefighters are missing.A total of 114 Mosquitoes made four attacks on a synthetic oil plant at Buerand three on a similar target at Homberg.Mediterranean Front.48. During the week ending dawn on the 4th, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 12,573 sorties and dropped 7,136 tons of bombs; 90 allied aircraft, including 45 heavy bombers, are missing and 170 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Heavy bombers flew a total of 2,776 sorties and operated exclusively outsideItaly; they bombed targets in the Balkans and South France.Italy.49. Medium bombers and fighter-bombers concentrated their efforts on theenemy&apos;s lines of communication. Numerous attacks were made on roads, railway bridges and viaducts in the area north of the battle line; very satisfactory results were reported and many hits were observed, but precise results of the effect of thisbombing cannot yet be assessed. &quot;Railway lines were cut frequently-on one dayalone the Rimini /Piacenza line was cut in 24 places and enemy transportvehicles were bombed and machine-gunned; 289 M/T vehicles were destroyed or damaged, also 20 locomotives and over 200 units of rolling-stock. Other targetsattacked included dumps near Pisa and Leghorn, railway centres at Faenza,Lugo, Ravenna and Cesana and the quays at Rimini. Enemy air opposition wason a small scale; 12 enemy aircraft were shot down and 16 Allied aircraft aremissino-.* The results of some of the attacks referred to above are given in Appendix VII.
South France.50. Seventy Fortresses, accompanied by 43 Mustangs, of the 8th U.S. AirForce, returning from Russia via Italy, dropped 154 tons on Beziers railway centre with very good results; all the bombers landed safely in this country. the target was also attacked by 93 Liberators.Montpellier railway centre and Toulon U/boat dock and harbour installa-tions were bombed by 154 and 233 heavy bombers respectively.Rumania.51.
