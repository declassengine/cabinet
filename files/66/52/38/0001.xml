It is issued for &apos;&apos;&quot;the&apos; personal use of.............-/S/tf^f^fTOP SECRET. v/   Copy No.W.P. (44) 388.12th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.KILLING OF SURVIVORS OF s.s. PELEUS BY U 852.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE Greek s.s. Peleus was torpedoed and sunk at approximately 2118 hourson the 13th March in the Atlantic south of Freetown. There were only threesurvivors, who stated that after the ship was torpedoed a U-boat* surfaced andattempted to kill all survivors. The rafts and wreckage were rammed, men inthe water were machine-gunned and bombs were thrown among the rafts. Thethree survivors escaped by shamming dead and allege that they actually heardGermans on board say &quot; All dead.&quot;2. On the 5th May, U 852 was sunk in the Indian Ocean and nearly fiftysurvivors captured. Their interrogation has produced evidence sufficient to convince any reasonable court that this U-boat was responsible for the murder ofthe crew of s.s. Peleus.3. The Senior Engineer Officer and other members of the crew have described the incident in detail. Apart from the Commanding Officer, Eck, the shootingis said to have been carried out by the Second Lieutenant, the Medical Officer andthe Engineer Officer, and the majority of the crew appear to have been genuinelyhorrified.4. The U-boat&apos;s chart has been recovered and still shows her track, whichplaces her.in the approximate position where s.s. Peleus was sunk at the correcttime. The log, which we have also recovered, states that she sank a ship at 2118on the 13th March in approximately that position. No other ship was sunk in that area at that time, and we, therefore, have direct documentary evidence connectingU 852 with the incident.5. This cold-blooded murder was without the slightest provocation. TheAdmiralty have been in consultation with the Foreign Office and treasury solicitor about the preparation of evidence, and affidavits have been taken fromthe three&quot; survivors and from some of the prisoners who have freely given damningtestimony on oath against the Commanding Officer, Second Lieutenant and medical Officer. - Further statements will be taken and affidavits obtained fromthe three survivors.6. The War Office have agreed that the whole crew shall be retained in theUnited Kingdom., instead of being sent to Canada, to await their trial. TheMedical Officer will meanwhile, be treated as an ordinary prisoner, since by his conduct he has forfeited his special protected status. Care is also being takento keep separate the guilty ones from those who have given testimony.7, A question that will require consideration at a later stage will be thetribunal before which the men are to be tried. The Greeks may put in a claim for jurisdiction as the victims were their nationals, but it seems desirable, owingto the particular nature of the case, that. we.should- largely control its handling.8.   We have considered whether Kapitanleutnant Eck was  acting  inaccordance with orders from the German High Command.   No other incident ofa similar kind involving a German U-boat has come to our notice, but the Captain[27824]
of U 1059, who is a prisoner in the United States, is reported to have said that before the 4th February of this year the Senior Officer of the 5th U-Boat Flotillain Kiel transmitted to him verbally a specific order from Admiral Doenitz thatif any ships were sunk all survivors were to be exterminated. Every effort hasbeen made in interrogating the crew of U 852 to discover the truth on this point.Those who have given evidence concerning the atrocity are believed to have been quite unaware of any such order having been issued. Eck himself has put hissignature to an affidavit stating that he was not under orders to exterminatesurvivors. In making this statement he must have realised that he was signinghis death warrant. On the other hand, he may.be deliberately shielding the high command.9.   Accordingly, the question of superior orders must be regarded as an open one.   If we should obtain further evidence supporting the view that the.German High Command have issued these orders, the case will assume evenmore serious proportions, and Admiral Doenitz himself and any others responsiblewill be liable to indictment as war criminals.10. Every possible step must be taken to protect our merchant seamenagainst a repetition of this incident. It is, therefore, necessary that a strong-warning should be conveyed to the German Government, but we must avoidsuggesting to the Germans that we are immediately staging a war criminals trial.The Germans would almost certainly react to any such suggestion by taking-reprisals on our own men in their hands. It is also undesirable to publish thatwe hold in our hands the men responsible for the murder of the survivors ofs.s. Peleus. Pressure would be likely in this country for an immediate trial, andour Allies would be encouraged to increase their pressure for the early trial ofwar criminals and quislings. I therefore propose that the trial of the guiltymembers of the crew of U 852 should not take place until the end of hostilities,and that for the present we should not inform the public that the trial is pending.11. I propose that the warning to the German Government should be conveyed in the- following manner. The Greek Government should be invited to protest strongly to the German Government concerning the atrocity reported bythe three survivors of s.s. Peleus. The Greeks would not be told that we haveapprehended those responsible for the atrocity, but we should ourselves address a note to the German Government saying that we hold in our hands the survivorsof a U-boat commanded by Kapitanleutnant Eck, and think it right to inform them that this U-boat appears to have been responsible for the incident whichhas been made the subject of a protest by the Greek Government; we are making further investigations, but must insist that meanwhile the German authoritiesissue the most categoric instructions to U-boat commanders to prevent any&apos;repetition of the incident. A strong warning would by this means be given tothe German Navy, and if no further step is taken, I do not think that theGermans would be stimulated to take any form of reprisals against allied prisoners in their hands.12. I may add that Japanese U-boats have already committed numerousatrocities of a similar kind which have been made the subject of a strong protest.A close watch is being kept in order to fix guilt on any of those responsible who may fall alive into our hands. The U.S.N. have captured a copy of the operational orders issued to a Submarine Force operating in the Fiji areacontaining express orders for the elimination of survivors. The name of the commanding Officer signing the orders will, in due course, be included in the list of Japanese war criminals.13.   I ask the War Cabinet to approve (a) the measures taken for the preparation of evidence and detention of the crew,described in paragraphs 5 and 6;(b) that no publicity should be given to the capture of those responsiblefor the atrocity;(c) that a warning should be conveyed to the German Government in themanner proposed in paragraph 11.Admiralty, S.W. 1, 12th July, 1944.
