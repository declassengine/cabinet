(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT)S E CR E TW.P.(hh) 363COPY NO.7TH JULY 19khWAR CABINETLABOUR PARTY DELEGATION TO THE U.S.S.R.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i hope a good deal of reflection will be given to the issues involved before the request for the necessary travel facilities to a delegation from the National Executive Committee of - theLabour Party is granted, at this juncture.I feel strongly that the original suggestion was right,viz. that the first political body to go from this country tothe U.S.S.R. should be an all party Parliamentary delegation.It is surely most important for the future of Europe and ofthe world that there should not appear to be a party cleavage inGreat Britain as to the vital necessity of the most cordial relations,  in peace as in war, with our Soviet allies and friendsIt seems to me that If it is made to appear both to&quot; theSoviet people and to the world, that any one party in our national Government is keener to cement the friendly relations  -now being gradually built between the two countries than are the others it would be a disaster.Parties in this country will continue to differ as to theplace and method of State organisation in national and inter-national life and economy, but these differences ought not to appear to affect, and do not affect the desire felt throughoutour land that, while our differing countries will be governedalong differing lines,  there oiight to be no party distinction&apos;as to the aim of an ever deepening friendship.      I hope,  there-fore,  that an all -party Parliamentary Delegation will be selectedto pay a visit,  if agreeable to the Soviet authorities;, before any one party is granted facilities which might seem to cast a.reflection on the general goodwill felt in all parties to thecause of Anglo-Soviet understanding.E,B.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall, S.VA1.7TH JULY 19M+.
