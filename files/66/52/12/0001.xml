(44) 48th Meeting,Conclusion 4 (2)).The following estimate of these requirements is based on returns obtainedfrom the Departments concerned. It has not, however, been discussed with theMinisters responsible for those Departments. We thought it premature todiscuss the various demands in detail before the general picture had been con-sidered by the War Cabinet. These detailed consultations can, we suggest, bemore profitably undertaken when the War Cabinet have laid down the. broadlines of man-power policy for the period under review.2. The Departments were asked to frame their estimates on the basis ofsuch restoration of civilian standards towards the pre-war level as they consideredreasonable, taking into account any specific commitments. They were alsoadvised to assume for this purpose that, while labour would be released from thewar sector for purposes of civilian resonstruction during the first year afterthe defeat of Germany, there would be no further releases until after the endof the Japanese war. Thus they could expect that their labour force would increase during the first year, and that the level reached at the end of that year would be maintained for another twelve months. The improvement in civilianstandards would, therefore, be gradual, and the full effect of the increased labour force would not be felt until the early part of the second year or even later.In the requirements which have been put forward, no allowance has beenmade for any unemployment, while pre-war working hours have been assumed.3.   The following special points arise : (a) The requirement for building is the estimate submitted to the Reconstruc-tion Committee (R. (44) 49). It does not represent the labour needed to do all the work which will be necessary, but is based upon an[27751] b
estimate of the amount of building labour which might be madeavailable on certain assumptions about demobilisation. While itwould be adequate (on certain favourable assumptions about, efficiency and absenteeism) to carry through the first year of the post-warbuilding programme, it would not meet the needs of the second year of the programme. When this estimate was framed it was assumed that there would be further substantial demobilisation during thesecond year of the Japanese war. If the estimate had been made onthe basis that there would be no further releases from the Forces tothe building industry during the second year of the Japanese war, alarger requirement would have been entered for the first year in orderto carry through the building programme for the second year.(b) No estimate has yet been made of the man-power needed for the construc-tion of pre-fabricated houses.(c) Certain of the civilian industries (e.g., textiles and clothing) are engagedto an appreciable extent on work for the Services, and allowance mustbe made for this in estimating the labour force required in theindustries concerned. The man-power required to meet Service needshas, in general, been estimated at about two-thirds of that employed at mid-1943, save in some special cases where there was reason to adopta different basis.(d) The post-war level of exports ought ultimately to be very substantially above the level of a good pre-war year, and to achieve such an increaseit is essential to get going early in our overseas markets. TheDepartments chiefly concerned (Board of Trade and Ministry ofSupply) have framed their estimates on the basis of achieving, at theend of the first year after the German war, a labour force directlyemployed on exports about equal to that employed before the war.Certain other exports, however (notably coal and food and drink) willnot by then be able to return to the pre-war level. Thus, the totalemployment on exports given in the estimate of requirements is belowthe pre-war level.(e) For certain non-manufacturing industries (particularly the distributive trades) there is no firm basis on which to estimate requirements. Thefigures for these industries which are included in the estimates involvestandards well below those which existed before the war, but thereare three considerations to be borne in mind. First, very large numbersof men and substantial numbers of women have been withdrawn fromthese industries for service in the Forces and the Women&apos;s auxiliary services. These men and women will have the right of reinstatementin the employments from which they were withdrawn. Secondly, largenumbers of women were transferred from these industries to morevital war work. When employment on munitions is reduced manyof these women will be discharged and will tend to return to their former employments, particularly where they have been transferredaway from their home areas. Thirdly, these losses have been partly offset by the increased employment of juveniles and married women,many of the latter being on a part-time basis. Some of these maywant to stay in their war-time employments and. employers may be willing to retain them.For these reasons and because it will not be possible to exercise thefull war-time powers of direction it may be difficult to restrictemployment in these industries to the moderate levels implied by the tentative estimates suggested.4. The following Table summarises the estimated requirements which havebeen put forward by the Departments. The detailed estimates are given in theAppendix. For comparison, figures are also given of estimated, employment inthe various industrial groups at the middle of 1939 : 1

Comparison with employment at mid-1939 shows that the estimated requirements do not aim at a return to pre-war standards. The total require-ment of man-power for all industries and services other than the munitions industries working for the Supply Departments is equal to about 92 per cent,of employment in 1939.  Two points must, however, be borne in mind.First, the industries and services in Group II will continue to havesubstantially larger numbers working on account of the Forces than they had in1939. Indeed, almost the whole of the increase in the estimated requirements overemployment in 1939 for this group arises on account of increased demands for national Government Service. In Group III manufacturing industries, theestimated requirement to meet the needs of the Services (489,000) is well in excessof the 1939 level.; . Secondly, a bare comparison of total requirements against pre-war employ-meht does not suffice for a comparison of civilian standards. Account must alsobe taken of the depletion of stocks of all kinds and the failure to carry outadequate maintenance of equipment during the war. The full restoration of pre-war standards would involve, for a time at least, a large?&apos; labour force than was employed in 1939.6. The basis of the building and civil engineering estimate has already been explained (paragraph 3 (la)), while reference has also been made to the fact thatthe non-manufacturing industries will be very far from returning to their pre-war level (paragraph 3 (e)). The following details relate to certain of the manu-facturing industries for which the Board of Trade are responsible. They aregiven solely as illustrations, and are subject to the possibility of switching, as occasion demands, the distribution of the labour in any industry between the homeand export markets : (a) For the engineering and other metal-using industries (included inGroup I) the requirement for civilian production for the home marketis 5 per cent, less than employment in 1935, which was not a good year.This is in spite of the fact that there will be a heavy demand for[27751] . b 2
repairs and replacements to machinery which is rapidly wearing out,as well as for the re-equipment of British industry, which willbe essential for effective and successful reconstruction generally.(b) For clothing and textiles the target is an annual clothing ration of84 coupons, against the present basic rate of 48 (or about 55 ifsupplementary rations are included), and about 75 per cent, of pre-war for household textiles. Supplies at this rate, however, would not reach the consumer until some 18 months after the German armistice,although it would probably be possible to give some smaller increasein the ration before that time. Supplies equivalent to over 100 couponswould be needed before rationing could be abandoned. In this fieldgenerally the labour force proposed for home civilian trade is one-thirdbelow the pre-war figure, and would mean returning to Avork for thehome civilian market less than one-half of the labour it has lost duringthe war.(c) For furniture the requirements would allow 60 units for about half amillion households a year, and some supplies for the general public.The ration is small; it is estimated that about 80 units are needed for two persons setting up house for the first time. The target wouldnot be achieved until about two years after the German armistice.4th July, 1944.E. B.W.
