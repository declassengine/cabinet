THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1944.CIVIL AFFAIRS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FRENCH.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a note on the progress of the civil affairs negotiations on the official level with the representatives of the french committee of National Liberation. The reference to the financial discussionshas been prepared in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.A. E.Foreign Office, 28th June, 1944.20SECRET Copy No.  3 SW.P. (44) 354.28th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.ANNEX.The talks have gone well and in a very friendly atmosphere. As was to beexpected, the French are very suspicious of A.M.G.O.T. and constantly refer totheir &apos;&apos; unfortunate experiences &apos;&apos; in administration in North Africa.To meet this state of mind, we have made some departures from the modelagreement with the Belgian, &amp;c, Governments. In order to get agreement wehave also had to include in our negotiations questions (publicity, censorship,property and relief supplies) which were not dealt with in the Agreements withthe Belgian, &amp;c, Governments.The present position is as follows : (i) We have reached agreement in the Main Committee upon the key articlesdefining the respective powers of the Commander-in-Chief and the french authorities as regards civil administration proper. The basis of these arrange-ments is the division of France into &quot;forward&quot; and &quot; interior &quot; zones. Thecivil administration is to be by the French throughout (except in extreme case ofmilitary necessity), but it is provided that the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s wishes mustbe met in the &apos;&apos; forward &apos;&apos; zone and that his forces shall have all the facilities which they require in the &quot; interior &quot; zone.(ii) The provisions on the complicated question of jurisdiction have beenagreed.(iii) In the matter of finance, British and French officials are discussing onthe basis of a &quot; Mutual Aid Agreement&quot; the provision to the French forces(including the forces in the interior) of. war supplies and equipment free oxcharge. The French on their part would give us supplies, facilities, &amp;c, withinFrance, free of charge as &quot; Mutual Aid.&apos; This arrangement, which would be similar to that existing in French North Africa, would be retroactive to &quot; D-day.&quot;The currency problem would be settled within this framework by a provision whereby the French are in effect recognised as the issuing authority of the&quot; supplementary francs,&quot; and would then proceed to put at our disposal all the currency required by the Allied forces.Agreement has been reached on the general principle, but the French are stilldemanding special safeguards that their mutual aid provisions shall not impose on France an undue financial burden.It is considered essential that at least a definite promise of mutual aid,shallfigure in the draft settlement. This is because &quot; Mutual Aid&quot; is the main12411   [27729]
contribution which the French can make to the liberation of France.  The treasury and Foreign  Office representatives  in  the -Financial  Sub-Committee have,emphasised this very strongly and hope to get agreement on a formula.Lockhart has reached agreement with the French upon a text covering publicity and censorship.  The comments of the War Office on this text are awaited.(v) Draft provisions regarding the restitution of French property in liberated France and the custodianship of enemy property (matters to which theFrench delegation attach the highest importance) are being urgently prepared with the other British Departments and we hope to produce a formula whichshould meet the legitimate French anxieties.(vi) Certain other miscellaneous provisions (fiscal immunities of the allied forces, civil claims, &amp;c.) are at an advanced stage of negotiation. We have not felt able to put a provision in the agreement about relief supplies, as the greatmajority of. these will come from America, but the French are prepared to accept an agreed minute recording identity of views on principles.Our idea, which M. Vienot has provisionally accepted, is that there shouldbe four separate documents (on civil affairs and jurisdiction; finance; publicity;and property), all of which could be turned into an agreement later by an exchange of notes between the Secretary of State and M. Vienot. An exchangeof notes (which was also the form adopted for the agreement with jthe AlliedGovernments) is much the most suitable as it enables us to side-step the term&quot; Provisional Government of the French Republic.&quot; We have so far succeeded in keeping this term out of all the documents which have been drafted.Chairmanship of Sir R. Bruce
