It has been assumed throughoutthat the European war will end in 1944.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service,7th July, 1944.SUPPLY OF MAN-POWER.1. It is estimated that at the end of 1944 the working population (men14-64, women 14-59) will number approximately 21.705,000.*This total will be distributed approximately as follows :  Services       ............      -......      4,825.000Civil Defence ............... 246.000Industry Group I    (Munitions)       .........      4.834.000Group II   (Basic)     ............      5,668.000Group III (Less essential).........      6,132,000Total        ...............     21,705.0002. If the European war ends in 1944, it is estimated that in 1945 theworking population will drop by about 1,630,000. The factors in this declineare as follows : (i) Casualties and wastage from Forces throughdeath, disability and retirements ...       ...       235,000Less prisoners returned to industry       ... 85.000---     150,000Industry (ii) Excess of normal wastage over normal intakeamong insured and uninsured- includingpart-time women   ...      ...      ...      ... 480,000(iii) Additional retirements among women Full-time     ............... 500.000Part-time    ............... .      175.000(iv) Raising school-leaving age from 1st April,1945*&quot;.................. 325,000Total ............ : 1,630,000* Excluding private domestic service.[27782]
3. There is naturally some uncertainty about item (i), but on the basis of past experience the estimate does not appear unreasonable, on the assumptionthat the Japanese war will continue throughout the year.4. Item (ii) represents a continuation of the trend now being experienced.It is the result of our having reached complete mobilisation by the end of 1943.From that&apos; point there have been no significant reserves upon which to draw,the only important source of new labour being juveniles leaving school. against this declining intake there has to be set the wastage from an abnormally swollenlabour force which includes a much higher proportion of married women andwomen with household responsibilities than heretofore.5. Item (iii) has been based on the assumption that, when both the Germanand Japanese wars come to an end, something like 1-g million women will retire from industry. This figure has been arrived at by a comparison of the propor-tions of women of various ages in industry before the war and at the present time,and by experimental calculations based on different assumptions as to the effectof war experience on the desire of married women to continue to undertake paidemployment. The retirement of 1-g million would still leave considerably morewomen in employment than before the war. It has been further assumed that not more than one-third of these retirements will occur during the first year afterthe German armistice.6. It is quite certain that large numbers of women will want to leaveemployment at the end of the German war. Whatever controls over labour maybe retained it will not be practicable to hold in employment those women whohave household responsibilities, or who are over 50 years old, who wish to with-draw.   It is possible that the figure of half a million retirements may be too low.7. Item (iv) assumes that the present intention to raise the school leaving age from the 1st April. 1945, is carried into effect.Estimated Requirements.8. A decline of 1,630,000 wdrdd reduce the working population by the endof 1945 to 20,075,000. The estimated requirements at the end of the &quot;first year of Stage II amount to a total of 21,846,000, and accordingly the deficiencj^ is aboutIf million. The comparison between the estimated requirements at the end of1945 and the estimated numbers available would be as follows&quot;: ServicesCivil DefenceIndustry Group    IGroup  group IIITotal ...estimated requirements.3,400,000   ]146,000* !4,886,000 16,007,000 \ 18,300,0007,407,000 J21,846,000EstimatedNumbersAvailable.20,075,00020,075,000Deficiency.1,771,000--   1,771,0009. The estimated requirement of 18,300,000 for industry can be furtheranalysed so as to distinguish separately the requirements for munitions, directexports of manufactures, National and Local Government, building and civil engineering and all others (principally home market).   This analysis is shown inthe following table :&apos; * Police and National Fire Service,pre-war numbers.The figure assumes a substantial increase over the
