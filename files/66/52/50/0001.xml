I. Draft Letter from the Prime Minister to Sir John Wardlaw-Milne,K.B.E., M.P.(Secret.)I wrote to you on the 25th May concerning the Memorandum of your committee about tank production. Since then the Cabinet have been able toconsider the Memorandum, and the conclusion we came to was that although agood deal of the ground which it covered had been traversed during the SecretDebate in the House of Commons on the 24th March, the interest which your committee has taken in this very important subject merited a reply moreEarticularly directed to their findings and recommendations. I have accordinglyad the enclosed document prepared for the information of your. Committee. .There are one or two general observations which I wish to make.Satisfactory American tanks were available in adequate numbers during 1943,and British troops were not engaged in large-scale tank operations after theTunisian campaign. These two factors removed, for the first time since Dunkirk,the fear of a quantitative deficiency which had previously prevented develop-ment of tank design and production on the lines we should have followed had webeen free to do so. The situation in 1943 enabled a drastic reshaping of ourtank production policy, and this accounts in large measure for the fact that 1943output fell substantially short of the estimate made at the end of 1942.The Minister of Production, the Secretary of State for War and theMinister of Supply have, during 1943, kept jointly under review the working ofthe new organisations which were set up at the end of 1942, and are satisfied thatthey are functioning efficiently and smoothly. The Ministers have advised methat in their opinion it would be unwise at this stage of the war to hand back tothe War Office the responsibility for obtaining the production of all technicalstores including tanks. I agree with them that such a major reversal of policy at this date would not be practicable or justified by anything that has happened in the last eighteen months. This is a matter of long-term policy to which full consideration will be given.So much for the review of past policy and our organisation. The resultsof the recent battle experience in Normandy have been included in the attached report. There are, however, certain aspects of future development, such as thenew special 6-pdr. shot, which rnuaLbe treated with the greatest secrecy, and i feel sure your Committee will appreciate that fact.I note that your Committee had it in mind to present a further report tothe House of Commons. Whether they will think it necessary to do so now in thelight of what was said during the Secret Debate and of What is said in the enclosed memorandum is, of course, a matter for them to determine, but  if theydo decide to publish a ReporVin whichjovjuit I am sure they would weigh theirwords with a full sense of responsibilit^fwould ask that any reference that ismade to current experience and future developments shall be general in character and in such terms as to avoid giving information which could conceivably be ofany value to the enemy.II. Draft Reply to the Memorandum on Tank Production by the SelectCommittee on National Expenditure.1. Introductory.The Committee, in paragraph 4 of their report, draw attention to the specialdiiiiculties with which they have been faced in giving a fair appreciation of theCromwell tank before it has undergone what the Committee rightly regard as theonly real test the test&apos; of battle. In subsequent paragraphs (paragraphs 8 (6)and 10 (iii)) the Committee express certain doubts as to the operational effective-ness of the Churchill. They further, in paragraph 10 (i), draw attention to the armament of the German Panther and Tiger tanks and infer that the armamentof British tanks will not prove a match for that of their opponents.2. Now that British tanks, including both Cromwell and Churchill, togetherwith a British adaptation of the Sherman mounting 17-pdr., have been inaction in Normandy and that Churchills have been in action in Italy, there is,for the first time, a firmer foundation of fact upon which to base an appraisementof British tank performance, and it will, no doubt, be reassuring to the Committee
to read the following extracts from reports from General Montgomery andGeneral Leese.3. About the fighting in Normandy, General Montgomery reports asfollows : &quot; In the fighting to date we have defeated the Germans in battle; andwe have had no difficulty in dealing with German armour, once we hadgrasped, the problem. In this connection British armour has played a notablepart.We have nothing to fear from the Panther and Tiger tanks; they areunreliable mechanically, and the Panther is very vulnerable from the flanks.Our 17-pdr. gun will go right through them. Provided our tactics are good we can defeat them without difficulty.&quot;Other reports from Normandy indicate that the Cromwell possesses speed,handiness and cross-country ability, which make it superior in these respects toother tanks. The Cromwell is, as the Committee will appreciate, primarily a weapon of offence. The Tiger and Panther are primarily weapons of defence andare being definitely used as such in the present fighting in Normandy.4. Of the part played by Churchills in the fighting in Italy, General Leesereports a s follows : &quot; It may interest you to know of the fine performance of the Churchilltanks which supported the Canadian Corps when they attacked and brokethrough the Adolf Hitler Line last month.The Churchills stood up to a lot of punishment from heavy anti-tank guns. Several tanks were hard hit without the crews being injured. Theygot across some amazingly rough ground. Their 6-pdr. guns made goodpenetration and were quick to load and aim.So good was the work of this Brigade with their Churchills that the canadians have as a privilege asked them to bear the Maple Leaf on theirtanks.The tank crews have come through their successful attack on the AdolfHitler Line with tremendous confidence in the Churchill tank. We shall make good use of every Churchill you send us.&quot;5. It is perhaps too early to come to a final judgment on matters of relativeefficiency of different types in the light of the conditions which are being, andare likely to be, met with in North-West Europe. But, whereas in previousoperations it cannot be denied that, with the exception only of the Churchill tank,the most effective tanks and tank weapons available to the Allies have been of american origin, the lead both in armament, ammunition and armour protectionhas passed to tanks and weapons of British manufacture and design and toconversions designed and carried out in this country, such as the mounting of17-pdr. in the Sherman tank.6. The reliability of the Cromwell has been proved and there is no doubt as to its efficiency as a fighting weapon. The Churchill, and to a lesser degreethe Cromwell, still require more maintenance than the Sherman. This, however,is to be expected in view of the heavy weight of Churchill and the high per-formance of Cromwell.7. No single new or unexpected fact has emerged from the experience of armoured operations in Normandy. In every case tank armaments and armourhave acted and reacted exactly as was foreseen, and have accomplished whatwas known and expected of them. One possible exception to this statement isthe new secret 6-pdr. special shot, which, though it has given the penetrationexpected of it, appears to have had an even greater lethal effect after penetrationthan was foreseen.8. No new tank weapon or type of ammunition has been employed by theenemy on this front, whereas we have put into action for the first time in these operations : Sherman tanks mounting the 17-pdr. gun.Churchill tanks carrying 6 in. of frontal armour.The Cromwell tank.The Crocodile Tank Flame Thrower. 1The CD. Amphibious Sherman tank, and    f All strictly secret.6-pdr. special shot; and other special adaptations and devices of lesser importance.[27858] b 2
9. Lastly, the lines of future development which General Montgomeryadvocates substantially coincide with and reinforce the policy we are at this moment pursuing; they also coincide with the views we have received from Italy.10. The following paragraphs contain a detailed commentary on theCornmittee&apos;s Report.II. The Results achieved in 1943.(A) General Comment.11. The Committee record their general impression that 1943 results,measured in terms of tanks fit for current battle requirements, have fallen far short of expectations, and been wasteful of expenditure.^^12. It is true that some of the expectations that existed at the end of 1942uffflTnot feeeft- realised in 1943, but the availability of American Sherman tanks inconsiderable numbers, and the pause in tank warfare since the end of the TunisianCampaign ^ave given- an opportunity of overhauling our tank production policyand placing it on a sounder footing. These two factors removed, for the first time since Dunkirk, the fear of a quantitative deficiency which had previouslyprevented development of tank design and production on the lines which, but forthat fear, would have been followed. The situation in 1943 enabled a drasticreshaping of our tank production policy, and this accounts in large measure forthe fact that 1943 output fell substantially short of the estimate made at the endof 1942.13. As regards expenditure, the Committee claim that tanks cost theMinistry of Supply 18-79 per cent, of their total expenditure on war-stores during1942-43. The figure actually supplied by the Ministry of Supply and correctlyquoted by the Committee in Appendix I to their -14th Report was 17-69 per cent.But this related not to expenditure on tanks, but to orders placed for tanks and alltracked vehicles in the year 1942-43. Expenditure on tanks as such represented9 per cent, and not 18-79 per cent, of the Ministry&apos;s total expenditure in thatperiod.(B) Prospect v. Performance.14.   The main points to be noted are :  (a) That the Crusader chassis proved suitable for special operational roles,for which no other existing chassis was available.(b) The General Staff do indeed require Churchills as Infantry tanks and they are now in use in France and Italy. These tanks played a decisive part in the breaking of the Adolf Hitler Line and, asindicated above, we have received favourable reports on them, and also on the Heavy Churchills, from Normandy.(c) That the Cromwell would have been used, if it had been required in 1943;but since there was little tank fighting and Shermans were available,opportunity was taken to submit it to prolonged tests and modification in order to bring it up to the present high standard. Units equipped with these tanks are now in action in Normandy, and GeneralMontgomery reports that they are proving reliable and with other british armour are playing a notable part in the battle.(C) The Operational Dividend.15. On page 5 of the Report the Committee gave a table in four columnspurporting to show that the operational dividend in gun-tanks was nil in the caseof all tanks except Valentines and Churchills and a few Matildas. This by itself is somewhat misleading. If there had been major tank battles since Tunisia, the picture would have been quite different.16. Moreover, the Committee&apos;s conception of &quot;Operational Dividend&quot; takesno account of the need for large numbers of tanks for training, which is itself animportant operational requirement. The 1943 Cromwells have been largely usedfor this purpose and the Centaurs, which, except for their engines, are identical with Cromwells, have been most valuable for training, and have enabled theMeteor-engined Cromwells to be reserved for battle-tanks or more advancedtraining. It is relevant to note that many hundreds of Shermans have likewisehad to be used for training.
17. The Committee also do less than justice to the importance and urgency of the special operational roles for which Crusaders in particular have beenadapted. Vehicles for these purposes could not have been obtained nearly soquickly or economically had they had to be specially designed as the Committeeappear to recommend (Report, paragraph 19). Special designing and switchingover of production to a new type might, indeed, have taken 2 years or more.i The Major-General, Royal Artillery, 21st Army Group, has reported verballythat the Crusader as a tower for the 17-pdr. has proved a success. Other reports from Normandy indicate that all users speak well of this equipment and that ithas been mechanically reliable. With tlfGLL uunuidGratiouf. in mind, tin, correct heading for,J1&quot;j fcfegdcolumn of the table should have been &quot; Q^exaJdaas^y^^eSt     gun tnrH &quot;   the table vvpjihj thrn -hr- 1 iilrl ;i nl i;i IIV&quot; correct   though it would not prove themittnnV contention ,III. The Future Programme.19.   Under this heading the Committee make several comments on armamentdevelopment which can be more appropriately dealt with below in section ^ff (of ^this Reply devoted to armament questions.20. On the Cruiser tank programme the Committee comment on the tailingoff of the Cromwell production after mid-1944. Some tailing off will occur, butthere will still be substantial production of Cromwells throughout 1944, andmaybe into 1945. The A. 34, which will eventually supersede the Cromwell,should not have the serious teething troubles which the Committee expect, as itis based upon and follows closely the now reliable Cromwell design.21. The Committee&apos;s remarks on the Churchill developments are substan-tially correct. But their assumption thai no Churchills are required with6-pdr. guns is incorrect. In fact, Churchills with 6-pdrs. have been effective in Italy and in Normandy, and General Montgomery has asked that one-quarterof his Churchill tanks should be equipped with 6-pdr. guns, this being in line with existing General Staff policy. He reports in particular that the 6-pdr.,with special H.V. armour-piercing ammunition, is a very good weapon and willpenetrate the Panther tank- anywhere, except frontally on the sloping plate.IV. Development of Armament.22. Under this heading the Committee comment on the impressions of delay and failure which-they sense in the development of a satisfactory tank-gun.(a) The 6-pdr. gun.23. The Committee claim that, owing to its ineffective H.E. shell, thisgun has been considered inadequate as a general tank gun since December 1942,and they ask why there has been so long a delay in replacing it by the 75-mm. gun(Report, paragraph 19). The fact is, however, that the 6-pdr. gun, with itssuperior A.P. performance as compared with the 75-mm., remains a standardGeneral Staff requirement for an appreciable proportion of tanks (videparagraph 21 above).(b) The 77-ram.24. The Committee recognise that this gun will give a better A.P.performance than the 75-mm., but state that the gun has not yet been producedand fired and its H.E. ammunition design is still under discussion. This mayhave been true at the time the Report was written, but both gun and gun mountinghad been produced and passed its C.I.A. test some considerable time before theReport was issued; the design of the H.E. projectile, also, is completed and the ammunition will be available when required.(c) The 75-mm.25. The Committee devote a considerable portion of their Report to the story of this gun and its teething troubles, and they claim (Report, para-graph 13) (i) That there was delay in getting this gun with a serviceable mountingfitted to Cromwells and Churchills.
(ii) That a design for mounting, which later proved dangerously inadequate,was approved for production.(iii) That tanks were issued to field formations with the defective gun mountings and that this had a bad effect on morale, as warnings hadto be given.(iv) That officers going through the A.F.V. school have had to be instructedon gearing known to be defective.26. The official General Staff policy on tank armament during 1942 required the tank gun to be a first-class anti-tank weapon and, secondarily, as effective as possible against personnel and lorries. Battle experience at the end of 1942and evolution of tank tactics caused a change and on the 3rd January, 1943, theGeneral Staff laid down that the main armament of the greater proportion of medium tanks should be an effective H.E. weapon, and, secondarily, as effective as possible against enemy armour. The rest were to have an armour-piercingweapon of high performance.27. The Ministry of Supply proceeded without delay to develop the 75-mm.gun. It is the case that there were difficulties and disappointments. The newgun began to be issued to troops within 9 months of the decision to adopt it(i.e., in October 1943). However, after its introduction into the Service, weak-nesses in the semi-automatic gear became apparent and to overcome these important modifications had to be introduced. To say that the consequent delaycould have been avoided by more extensive trials is to argue backwards. Trialswere carried out on the normal scale which has proved adequate for other gunsand this is one of the cases where weaknesses were revealed in service use whichwere not shown up in acceptance trials. The necessary modifications were rapidlyintroduced and all tanks mounting the 75-mm. guns are now completely modified to the approved standard.28. In paragraphs 30-33 of their Report the Committee endeavour to assess the factors which have contributed to the disappointments that occurred in thecase of this gun. The Committee themselves clearly recognise that the matter is one involving complicated technical issues. While not agreeing with all theinferences drawn by the Committee, it is true that mistakes were made andwrong materials used and steps have been taken to ensure that the lesson willbe applied in the conduct of future trials, and in production.29. As regards the Committee&apos;s &quot; practical conclusions from the failure &quot;(Report paragraph 34), the following points may be made. The normal tests were carried out. The design was carried out by the Technical Department of D.T.D.with full knowledge of the problems concerned. The trials were carried out underthe supervision of CIA. and gave results which were considered satisfactory, andthese results were confirmed at the trial carried out at Lulworth in the summer.These trials were conducted by a combination of D.T.D. and the ExperimentalWing of the War Office Tank Gunnery School. Officers with recent battleexperience were present at the Lulworth trials.30. The Committee also comment on the danger of split responsibility(Report paragraph 35), the D.G. of A.&apos;s responsibility being limited to develop-ment and inspection of the gun itself and its ammunition. The line, however, mustbe drawn somewhere, and it should be noted that the relation of the gun-mountingto the turret and fighting compartment is even closer and more complex thanthe relation of the gun to the mounting. The addition of the D.G. of A. tothe Tank Board will assist the smooth working of the machinery for co-operation.V. The Significant Points in the Results of 1943.31. The Committee pick out as outstanding &quot; faulty appreciations &quot; at theend of 1942 :-(a) The decision &apos;&apos; to put all eggs into one basket&apos;&apos; and concentrate on astill unproved type of cruiser tank (the Cromwell).(b) The decision to continue to rely for the major part of the programme on an engine (the Liberty) which on past performance was provedinadequate.(c) The decision regarding the parent firm for the Cromwell.
32.   On these the following comments are made : (a) The decision to press forward with the Cromwell against a background of available Shermans has been fully justified by recent experience inNormandy.(b) The Liberty engine had to be used at the outset of 1943 because no otherengine of sufficient power was developed and capable of being produced in adequate numbers for the tank programme thencontemplated. On the basis of a decision taken in September 1942 theMeteor capacity was expanded with the greatest speed that circum-stances allowed, but this expansion could give no yield of completeengines in 1943.(c) The Committee have apparently misunderstood  the history of theCromwell parentage. It was the declared intention of the Ministryfrom an early stage to entrust the parentage of this machine to theVauxhall firm as soon as their commitments in respect of the Churchillpermitted. In pursuance of this policy the Vauxhall firm wereassociated with development work on the Cromwell from - an earlydate and actually built several prototypes. When, however, it became necessary to continue the production of Churchills and to embark on further development of this type of Infantry tank, it was clear thatthe Vauxhall firm could no ionger undertake the parentage of thetotally different Cromwell. Steps were therefore taken as early aspossible to bring to an end the arrangements which had always been regarded as provisional under which the Birmingham RailwayCarriage firm had acted as temporary parents, and to transfer theparentage formally and finally to Leylands.33. The following are the specific answers to the questions posed by theCommittee in paragraph 19 : (a) Could not the decisions reversingearlier policy (e.g., as regards theMeteor engine programme) have beentaken earlier %(b) Has it really been necessary, forthe sake of avoiding dislocation inemployment, to continue the productionof obsolete or condemned types ofvehicle and engine so long as has beendone \(c) When it was decided that certaintanks (Crusader, Cavalier, Centaur)must continue in production eventhough they would not be accepted asgun-tanks, was the task of preparingall the modifications and applianceswhich would be necessary for theiralternative uses undertaken with suffi-cient vigour and foresight ? We under -stand, for example, that the productionof Centaurs as gun-tanks has been con-tinued much longer than was intendedbecause the fittings and modificationsrequired for using them as A.A. tanks were not ready. Our evidence alsosuggests some confusion as regards the equipment and uses of O.P. tanks.(d) Lastly, and most important, thequestion already referred to : why hasthere been so long a delay in replacing the 6-pdr. with the 75-mm. gun ?(a) No. The decision to developMeteor capacity independent of aero-engine capacity was taken at the earliest moment at which it could be imple-mented, i.e., September 1942.(&amp;) Even assuming that the vehiclesreferred to were fully obsolete or con-demned (which is not true), abrupttermination of programme would havedisrupted the production organisationof manufacturers to an extent whichwould have crippled the further pro-duction of tanks in this manufacturing capacity.(c) Yes. When a decision was takento discontinue the use of a model asa gun-tank, no avoidable delay instopping production of such gun-tanksoccurred. Production of chassis neces-sarily continued in advance of thesupply of fitments required for specialroles, which fitments frequently involvednovel and complex design and produc-tion problems.(d) This question has been dealt withabove (paragraph^ et seq).
34. The Committee&apos;s comments on the future programme for Cromwellsand A. 34&apos;s in paragraph 20 of the Eeport are answered in paragraph^ above.35. Under the heading of &quot; the inescapable facts &quot; the Committee record the following impressions of the general results of the production story in 1943 : (i) That, apart from the Valentine used in Russia and the Churchill in tunisia, no British tanks during 1943 have been considered worthy of a place in the main battles.This is answered in paragraphs 14 (&amp;) and/5 et seq above,(ii) That British tanks issued to British troops have gained a badreputation both for mechanical reliability and fighting arrangements.This is a sweeping statement which fails to take into account thesituation which this country found itself in after Dunkirk and of the many difficulties that have had to be overcome since then. Recentreports from operational theatres show that the Churchill andCromwell have proved l^eliable.(iii) That British factory workers have seen very large quantities ofcompleted tanks broken up or parts (finished and half finished) pilingup to be taken away as scrap.This ignores the fact that after Dunkirk tanks had to be produced in numbers suitable at any rate for home defence in a time of desperateemergency. Such tanks fulfilled this purpose and also a useful trainingrole, but it is not surprising, and should not be a reflection on theorganisation in 1943 that Covenanters and Matildas of 1940-41 now have to be scrapped. The inference from the Committee&apos;s statement that it is quite common for British workers to complete tanks andthen see them broken up before being used is wrong. No finished tankshave been broken up before they have completed a considerable mileagein training and other uses.(iv) That  these  things  have  combined  to create  a  most  unfortunatepsychological atmosphere amongst workers and troops, which deservesthe urgent attention of the War Cabinet.Although such an atmosphere may unquestionably be encouraged by irresponsible public criticism, those who are directly andcontinuously in touch with the workers on the one hand and the troops on the other are not prepared to subscribe to the views expressed bythe Committee. As indicated above, the recent performance ofBritish tanks in battle has provided the best possible reassurance.VI. Lessons from Special Cases.36. The Committee comment in some detail on the lessons to be learnt froma short preliminary report they have seen about the 3,000-mile reliability trial.37. A. The trials are said to have brought to light a few serious designdefects, but &quot;a lot of very serious manufacturing faults.&quot;It is admitted that in some cases faulty materials and workmanship have found their way into completed tanks. Every effort has been, and will continueto be, made to eliminate them, and complaints of this sort have been greatly reduced. It is believed that the inspection system which has been built up andreorganised over the past year or more (see paragraph 51) will result in a continued improvement. Isolated cases of faulty workmanship and materials are liable to be exaggerated, and to draw the conclusion that the tank programme as a whole is suffering seriously from such defects would be a gross injustice tothe large majority of manufacturers and workpeople employed.38. B. Parent firms, although held responsible by the Ministry of supply for the products of the whole group, have no established authority to controlworking methods of members of a group.The principle underlying this comment may be sound, but its practical application is a matter of great difficulty. The principle of supporting theauthority of the parent company is a matter to which the Ministry of Supply isdevoting constant attention.39.-C.   It is important to use the greatest care in selecting sub-contractors.This is agreed, but it should be remembered that the rapid expansion of the tank industry took place after the expansion of both naval and aircraft produc-tion and at a later stage of the general expansion of munitions production, so
that a number of firms who might have been the most suitable for many importanttank components were not available.40. D. There is a shortage of qualified staff both for inspection by theI.F.V. and inspection by manufacturers themselves, and this can only be countered by (a) transferring selected R.E.M.E. personnel to the I.F.V. and(b) taking a certain number of trained personnel in the factories off production,if necessary facing a loss in quantity to secure a better guarantee of quality.The shortage of trained personnel is admitted but it is an overall shortage(see paragraph 51).VII. Conclusions and Recommendations.41. Comments on the &quot;Main Conclusions,&quot; and the &quot;Recommendations,&quot;of the Report (paragraph 37 to the end) may conveniently be taken together.A. The Immediate Emergency.42. The Committee comment that it is of supreme importance that whenCromwell tanks are first tested in battle they should not fail in reliability andthat requirements in respect of these first issues of Cromwells must havesuperiority. Any failure of these tanks would, in the Committee&apos;s view, finallyshake the confidence of British troops in the British cruiser tank.This is accepted in full and every effort has been made to ensure that thesetanks, when issued to operational troops, are in as perfect a condition as canbe achieved, and it is evident from recent reports that a high degree of success hasbeen obtained.B. Organisation and Responsibility.43. The Committee set as their ideal objective the reunion under the WarOffice of all responsibility for obtaining production of technical instruments of war, such as tanks.The.Committee do not suggest in what way this transfer back to War office would in fact meet the ills they describe. At this stage of the war retransferof research design and production functions to the War Office would be littlemore than a nominal change since the same staff would need to be employed inmore or less the same places. Most of the problems of responsibility and liaisonto which the Committee draw attention would remain- in what would inevitably be a vast production organisation under the War Office. In any case, now is notthe time to undertake such a complete reversal of the policy followed since 1939.44. Pending the full implementation of the change suggested in thepreceding paragraph the Committee recommend that everything possible shouldbe done to create a close partnership between War Office, Ministry of Supplyand manufacturers, the dominating lead being taken by the War Office.Such a partnership already exists and the War Office does in a real sensealready occupy the dominant position since it is the customer and initiates therequirements.   Full contacts are provided, by the Tank Board, and at this level,as well as at all lower levels, a real integration of effort between the two Departments concerned has been and is increasingly being achieved.45. The Committee claim that the Tank Board is becoming a less effectiveexecutive instrument than in the past. That is not so. The Board&apos;s executive authority is subject only to the agreement of the two Ministers concerned and ofthe War Cabinet where necessary. The Board&apos;s day-to-day decisions operatewithout let or hindrance. The executive functions of the Board are exercisedprimarily in the Ministry of Supply&apos;s province, and therefore the Committee&apos;view that the Chairman of the Board should be a War Office representative maybe questioned, It is the considered view of Departments that the realisticapproach is to appoint the best Chairman available irrespective of the Departmentto which he belongs. It may be added that the War Office themselves do not desire a change in the present constitution of the Tank Board.46. The Committee&apos;s view that the Tank Board should be as small in numberas possible is accepted, as is their recommendation that the D.G-. of A. should bea member of the Tank Board. Their recommendation that C.A.F.V. orD.G.A.F.V. should be given full responsibility in carrying out in terms ofproduction the Tank Board&apos;s decisions is a reflection of present practice-.[27858] &apos;       c
47. The Committee recommend that representatives of select parent firms should, normally attend all meetings of the&quot; Board but need not be members.Such representatives have several times been invited, to Board meetings to dealwith particular problems, but it is not thought desirable or necessary that theyshould attend all meetings.48. With regard to the recommendation that there should always be adequate representation of recent tank-fighting experience, it should be notedthat the War Office representation on the Tank Board does at present include an officer with outstanding experience of such a kind.49. Within the War Office the Committee recommend that there shouldbe a closer unity of responsibilities and that officers with recent operationalexperience should be kept in constant contact with all stages. The unity ofresponsibility to which the Committee refer is in fact attained under D.C.I.G.S.for all things which are the province of the War Office.With regard to the comprehensive Tank Centre which the committee recommend, the arrangements between War Office and Ministry of Supply forcarrying out tests and trials are working smoothly, and, with the exception of facilities for gunnery trials, the establishment at Chobham fulfils the require-ment. An entirely new Centre, with facilities for all types of trials, embracingthose undertaken at Chobham, Shoeburyness and Lulworth, would not bejustified at this stage of the war.50. The Committee consider (Report paragraph 47) that the present divisionof responsibility involves the danger that the manufacturers may not feelresponsible for results, and they contrast this position with that in the aircraft industry where the reputation of the producer is closely knit with the perform-ance of the plane. It is to counteract this tendency that the recommendation that members of three firms Vauxhall, Leyland and Vickers should normally attend meetings of the Tank Board is made (see paragraph 37 above).The Committee also recommend that immediately a new type of tank is decided upon, responsibility for parentage should be allocated to an organisation ofproved efficiency with an adequate team of engineers and that thereafter no workon the designs and development should be done by Departments unless inco-operation with the parent firm.It is accepted Departmental policy to entrust a new type of tank to a singlemanufacturing organisation of proved efficiency and thereafter to place thefullest possible responsibility for design on the selected parent firm. Only onefirm, however, has the necessary specialist resources to handle many of thetechnical design problems relating to the fighting qualities of tanks and firmsmust therefore continue to rely on the War Office and Ministry of Supply fora great deal of help. It is in general not the practice of D.T.D. to workindependently, but rather to assist the design staff of the parent firm and towork in close consultation with them. The Committee&apos;s observations in factdo less than justice to the help given by D.T.D. to parent design firms on thefighting side of tanks.C. Workmanship, materials and inspection.51. The Committee recommend that every possible step towards improve-ment, where necessary, should be taken; that the inspecting staff of I.F.V. shouldbe overhauled drastically; and that it would be justifiable to face some sacrificein quantity of tanks produced in order to attain a higher quality and thereforeif necessary recruitment for manufacturers&apos; inspection staffs should be from theproduction lines (this applies also to sub-contractors.)The need for strengthening inspection staffs has been fully recognised.Industry and the Armed Forces have been drawn on for recruitment of inspection personnel to the fullest extent possible and the numbers of technical staff employed on tank inspection work were doubled between November 1942and March 1944. Man-power limitations are however very severe and the with-drawal of any substantial number of men from production lines or R.E.M.E.is by no means so simple as the Committee would suggest. Departmental policy,as developed in 1943, has been to emphasise quality rather than quantity intank production, a change in emphasis then for the first time made fully possibleowing to the circumstances outlined in paragraph 2 above.
D. Lack of urgency: priority for the tank programme.&apos; 52. The Committee record (Report, paragraph 50) their general impression that owing to the availability of Shermans there has been a lack of a sense of urgency and drive behind the whole British tank programme. That there hasbeen any such lack is denied. The Committee proceed to recommend that &quot;thereshould be no doubt about adequate priority for everything that is involved in the agreed tank programme.&quot; Up to the autumn of 1943 the tank programmeundoubtedly had a lower priority than aircraft, but since that date arrangements have been made in collaboration with the Ministry of Production for all essentialparts of the tank programme to be given equal first priority.E. Links with fighting experience.54. The Committee consider that the procedure for introducing minor modifications proved necessary by fighting experience should be improved. TheMinistry of Supply, with War Office assistance, maintain in all theatres of warextensive military technical services which act as a direct and efficient link betweenthe troops in the battle lines and the design and production organisations.Further methods of strengthening such links are continually being studied.Officers with recent operational experience are kept in close touch with all stages of development.F. Result of failure to implement recommendations.&apos;55. The Committee finally conclude that unless determined steps are now taken to improve the organisation for Tank development and production, money and war resources will continue to be wasted, and, what is worse, there is a serious danger that the country will at the end of the war have no properly functioningorganisation for handling this extremely important branch of mechanical warfare.It is agreed that it would be a national disaster if the country were to failduring the war to build up a first-class organisation for producing British tanks.With the growth of experience in industry and in Government establishments this objective is being progressively achieved and the Committee need have no fear that every effort is not being exerted towards that end.III.-A Summary of Reports received on the Performance of British Tanks.The principal points brought out by General Montgomery&apos;s Memorandum,the War Office comments thereon, and the latest operational reports are asfollows : Guns.The 17-pdr. and the 6-pdr. with Sabot ammunition are extremely effective.It is quite clear that the fitting of the 17-pdr. to the Sherman tank was ofthe highest operational value and we are pressing on with further conversions.Although General Montgomery draws attention to the weakness of the 75-mm.as an armour-piercing weapon, its H.E. shell is good and as an all-purposeweapon the gun is still popular; further, it proved of great value in the assaultphase, both in normal tanks and in D.D. Sherman and Flail tanks.It must, however, owing to its poor penetrative power, be considered as out-moded, and its place must be taken as and when possible by the 77-mm. and17-pdr.The 6-pdr. Sabot has been a great success, and Churchill tanks with this gunand ammunition are being provided in the ratio which General Montgomery nowasks for, namely, one per group of three tanks. Sabot ammunition is now coming-out of production for the 17-pdr., and it will also be available for the 77-mm.(which takes the same shell and which is the gun of the improved version of theCromwell (Comet)) when tanks with this gun come into use.A rmour.General Montgomery would like to see our armour increased and more usemade of sloping plates. The War Office, however, point out that the heavyChurchill has very considerably better armour than Tiger, Comet has frontalarmour of approximately the same thickness as Tiger, and in the newly-designedCruiser tank, A.41, a sloping frontal plate superior to that of Panther is used.
Reliability.The Sherman is still the most reliable tank if low maintenance is taken as one of the criteria of reliability. In actual operations the reliability of theCromwell has been proved, but it is nevertheless true to say that the Churchill,and to a lesser degree the Cromwell, still require more maintenance than theSherman. This is to be expected in view of the heavy weight of the churchill and the high performance of the Cromwell. Tiger and Panther are relativelyunreliable.General Montgomery has a certain amount to say about optical instruments.His points of criticism have, however, already been largely met, and binoculars(e.g. the No. 5 already issued) and telescopes (e.g. the new 3-power telescope) nowin production should improve matters very much.As is stated in the note to the Select Committee, it is clear from GeneralMontgomery&apos;s report that the lead both in armament, ammunition and armourprotection has passed to tanks and weapons of British manufacture and design,and that the development policy which we are now pursuing is in accord with the lessons to be learnt from the most recent battle experience.
