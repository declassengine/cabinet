(44) 373.6th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER ONE YEAR AFTER THE DEFEAT OF GERMANY.Labour Required for Munitions.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.1. At the request of the War Cabinet (W.M. (44) 48th Conclusions,Minute 4) the Chiefs of Staff have been considering what would be the effect ifService man-power one year after the defeat of Germany were limited to 3 million.At the same time the Joint War Production Staff have considered what further economies could be made to reduce the labour allocated to the Munitions industries in Stage II.2. Taking operational needs, as defined in Annex A to W.P. (44) 173 andafter examining further the resources likely to be available at the end of theGerman war, I think it would be possible for the Supply Departments to produce the munitions required with a labour force (one year after the German defeat)of not more than 2,900,000. This is 220,000 less&quot; than the 3,120,000* stated inparagraph 3 of the Appendix to W.P. (44) 173. The comparative figures are asfollows : Men and Women in Thousands.Estimate given    revised in W.P. (44) 173. Estimate.    Reduction.Admiralty       ...... 950 850 100Ministry of Supply    ... 770 740 30M.A.P.....:.      ... 1,400 1.310 90Totals.......3,120 2,900 2203. . These reductions arise from a variety of causes.  For example :  The A dmiralty. It w7as assumed in the previous estimate that labour in the shipyards would increase by 50,000. It is now clear that this &quot;is not likely totake place. The Admiralty also feel able to reduce by 50,000 the labour forceemployed on consumable stores for the Navy..Their figures include labour engaged on merchant ship construction.The Ministry of Supply, who have already estimated for a very substantial reduction one year after the German defeat; might possibly squeeze out another30,000 without serious prejudice to the fulfilment of War Office requirements as at present estimated.The Ministry of Aircraft Production. Two factors should be taken intoaccount. In the first place the stocks of aircraft and associated stores likely tobe surplus at the end of the German war will be considerable (probably over 5,000).Secondly, during the first year of the Japanese war production in the UnitedKingdom is bound to continue at a higher rate than that needed for maintenance.I feel, therefore, that during that year production in this country could be prunedmore drastically than had previously been estimated. The Air Ministry wouldbe ready to use the surplus referred to above to the extent of 100 aircraft per* Note. This includes 150,000 for the production by Ministry of Supply and Ministry of aircraft Production of civil transport, &amp;c.f27766]
month, which should free 90,000 workers from the aircraft industry. My own view is that we should use more of the surplus, and I think it would be reasonable to estimate the reduction in the aircraft industry at a larger figure.4. A very important factor in all these calculations is the degree ofassistance from North America on which we can count in Stage II. There arevery strong arguments for endeavouring to secure both from the United states on Lend/Lease and from Canada under Mutual Aid, &quot; proportionate assistance &quot;during this period. By this I mean that if the Service and munitions labour force during Stage II were 75 per cent, of the end 1944 level, Lend/Leaseassistance for munitions in the aggregate should be not less than 75 per cent, ofits present level. It is of the utmost importance that some way be found of making such aid a firm commitment. Unless that is secured there is inevitably somedouble insurance and therefore waste of resources. It is equally necessary to clearthis point soon because on it hangs the extent to which capacity is released here and in the United States.5. In making the estimates given in paragraph 3, the Ministry of Supplyhave assumed that such assistance will be forthcoming to the extent that they could use it. The Air Ministry and the Admiralty have taken, for the Royal Air Forceand Fleet Air Arm aircraft, a basis of aid from the United States which is less than the current rate of assignment but which was as much as they feltthey could reasonably expect as an assured supply, without some generalundertaking of this kind. In framing their estimates of labour requirements,the Ministry of Aircraft Production had made in certain cases rather more generous assumptions of United States aid, but these assumptions were still very substantially less than proportionate aid.6. It seems clear that we must try to secure a larger measure of aid in aircraft from the United States than is at present assumed. I would estimate that if we- obtained from the United States aircraft and associated stores inamounts nearly equal to the present rate of deliveries from that source, we shouldbe able to save in this country another 250,000 workers. The Service Depart-ments point out that if this happened we should be dependent on United Statessupplies of aircraft to the extent of roughly one-third in the Royal Air Force andtwo-fifths in the Fleet Air Arm.     *7. We should not be able to justify proportionate aid for Army stores,because a large part of our present supplies from the United States is in theform of stores such as tanks, which we shall not require in large numbers in stage II, and because there are very few stores which we do not already obtain from the United States which we could reasonably ask them to make speciallyfor us in the concluding stages of the war.8. I think it should be recognised that if the Cabinet; after consideringthe Chiefs of Staff paper, decide that not more than 3 million can be allocated to the Services in Stage II, this reduction of 500,000 from the previous estimateswould not necessarily mean that there would be a corresponding reduction inthe labour ^force required for munitions. A reduction, for example, in the forcesengaged on occupation and garrison duties would obviously have little effect upon munitions requirements. On the other hand, munitions requirements forthe Japanese war m proportion to the man-power engaged, would be broadlyon the same scale as those for the war in Europe.9.   I may summarise the conclusions of this paper as follows : (a) On present assumptions regarding Service commitments in Stage II,the lowest figure that we can take for munitions labour one year afterthe defeat of Germany is 2,650,000. This will only be possible ifwe can get proportionate assistance under Lend/Lease from theUnited States and Mutual Aid from Canada.(b) If the War Cabinet decide that our military liabilities for the war against Japan as at present estimated must be reduced, then a further reduction in munitions labour will, of course, be possible.(c) If, however, the War Cabinet decide that the only reduction which canbe made in Service man-power requirements for Stage II is in ourliability for occupation and garrison duties, this reduction will have very little effect on munitions labour requirements.O.
