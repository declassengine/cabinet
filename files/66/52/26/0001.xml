THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECEET.W.P. (44) 376.4th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.LABOUR PARTY DELEGATION TO THE U.S.S.R.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I have been informed by the Secretary of the Labour Party that, as the resultof discussions with him, the Soviet Ambassador has intimated that the soviet authorities would welcome a delegation from the National Executive Committeeof the Labour Party. Five members of the Executive, none of whom are members of Parliament, have been selected to form the delegation. I have beenasked whether it is possible for the delegation to be afforded the necessary facilities to travel to Russia. I understand that the delegation.will probablyconsist of Professor Harold J. Laski, Mr. Alfred J. Dobbs, Mr. Percy Collick,Miss Alice Bacon and Mr. William Gillies.2. I annex (Annex A) a message from the Central Committee of theCommunist Party of the U.S.S.R., which shows that the purpose of the delegationis to establish contact and enter into negotiations with the representatives of theCommunist Party of the U.S.S.R., and that the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R.welcomes this proposal. Annex B contains the text of a memorandum whichhas been handed to the Soviet Ambassador and which gives details of the matters which the delegation proposes to discuss.3. The political and military situations are now favourable for the visit ofsuch a delegation, and I think that a useful purpose may be served by thediscussion of the matters suggested with the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R.,which means, of course, with those who control the Soviet Government. We mayby this means get a new view of the present temper and intentions of the SovietGovernment. I propose, therefore, that the delegation should be provided withall the necessary travel facilities.4. My colleagues will remember (W.M. (42) 174th Conclusions, Minute 2,and W.M. (43) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 1) that when a similar proposal wasmade at the end of 1942, it was felt that, if any delegation were then to go, itwould be better that it should be a strong Parliamentary delegation representingeach of the main political parties and both Houses of Parliament. Thissuggestion, which has since been raised with me a number of times, has not beenpursued as the circumstances never seemed propitious. If the Labour Party nowsend a delegation to visit the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, that neednot stand in the way of a subsequent visit by a Parliamentary delegation to theappropriate body in the U.S.S.R., which would presumably be the Supreme Soviet.It would hardly, however, be suitable for the one delegation to follow too closeon the heels of the other.A. E.Foreign Office, 4th July, 1944.ANNEX A.Message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, of the U.S.S.R.[Communicated to Mr. Percy Collick, Miss Alice Bacon, Professor Harold J.
