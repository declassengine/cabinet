THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET-:       . - Copy No. 3 6W.P. (44) 387.10th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE STRIKES IN COPENHAGEN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I THINK my colleagues will be interested to see the annexed note on therecent strikes in Copenhagen.2. Although these occurrences have no direct bearing on the immediate war-effort, this victory of the Copenhagen strikers is a most satisfactory sign ofGerman weakness. This is certainly the first time in any enemy-occupiedcountry that the civilian population have been able to enforce their demands on the German military authorities.A. E.Foreign Office, 10th July, 1944.ANNEX.On the 26th June the Germans imposed a curfew in the Copenhagen area,together with a ban on all gatherings of more than five persons. This actionfollowed a particularly successful act of sabotage carried out on the 22nd Juneagainst the armament plant Rekylriffel Syndikat.2. The curfew was ignored by the Danes, and in the following days therewere a number of incidents in the streets. On the 29th June strikes began inBurmeister and Wain&apos;s works and spread elsewhere. The Germans relaxed thecurfew on the 29th June, but this had little effect, and the next day strikes spreadand became general. There were serious disturbances and clashes with theGermans.3. On the evening of the 30th June the Germans took over all public buildings and stopped water, gas and electricity supplies. A state of siege wasproclaimed on the 1st July and supplies of food to Copenhagen were cut off.Hitherto the strikes seem to have been spontaneous movements on the part &quot;of theworkers, the result of general irritation against the Germans and against theSchalburg Corps, a body of Danish Nazis employed by the Germans to assist themagainst Danish patriots. At this stage the Council of Freedom, the body whichhas been formed inside Denmark to act as a focus of resistance, stepped in and issued a proclamation to the effect that the strike would continue unless&apos; theGermans undertook that the Schalburg Corps should be removed from the country,the state of siege raised, the roads leading to Copenhagen opened and the supplyof water, gas and electricity resumed, and that no reprisals should be taken onaccount of the strike. At the same time they stated that the time for activeresistance had not yet come.4. On the 2nd July the Germans gave in to the extent of permitting the resumption of electricity, gas and water supplies and of public transport, butannounced that the curfew and the ban on meetings would continue. A numberof representatives of Copenhagen municipalities and Danish labour andindustrial organisations, in agreement with the heads of the Danish Adminis-tration, issued an appeal*to the population to return to work immediately.12430   [27797]
5. In spite of this, the Council of Freedom issued a new appeal duringthe night of the 2nd July to continue the strike, and repeated their demand thatthe Schalburg Corps should be abolished and no reprisals taken on the leadersof the strike.6. On the 3rd July appeals from Mr. Buhl, the Social-Democrat leader andformer Premier, and other leading Danes, were broadcast urging the strikers toreturn to work. Meanwhile the Germans had apparently agreed to accede tothe demands voiced by the Council of Freedom, for, on the same day, the Councilissued a proclamation recommending that work should be resumed, as theSchalburg Corps had already been removed from the streets of Copenhagen and negotiations about its future disposal were proceeding, while the Germans had agreed to the other Danish demands.7. Until further reports are received it is impossible to say what part wasplayed by the various Danish authorities in achieving this result, or how farthere was co-operation between the politicians, trade union leaders, &amp;c, on theone hand, and the Council of Freedom on the other; but there are indications that Mr. Buhl and the Council maintained close contact throughout the crisis,and that the Council of Freedom do not seek to create a rift in Denmark fortheir own ends, but, on the contrary, aim at preserving unity within the country.The strike did not take place on orders from this country, nor was there anyincitement by the B.B.C.
