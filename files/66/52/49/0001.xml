naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Unloading in the assault area has improved with more favourable weather.  Minelaying by enemy aircraft has continued.Coastal forces have fought a number of engagements in the Channel and north Sea.Carrier-borne aircraft of the Home Fleet have attacked the Tirpitz inKaafiord.A successful raid has been carried out on the island of Symi in the dodecanese.Norwegian Waters.2. Reconnaissance of Kaafiord on the 12th showed the Tirpitz at hermoorings with seven small ships alongside; there was no evidence that she wasabout to move.   Two destroyers were also sighted.On the 17th. carrier-borne aircraft made an attack on Kaafiord. Theoperation was covered and supported by H.M.S. Duke of York and ships of theHome Fleet. Owing to a smoke screen 800 feet high, the bombing was blind andthe results could not be seen. Fog caused a second attack to be abandoned. OneCorsair was lost.Home Waters.3. The weather during the week has been in general more favourable tounloading in the assault area, apart from delay caused on one day by fog. the totals unloaded in both the British and the U.S. sectors up to p.m. on the 18thwere : 1,312,352 men, 279,017 vehicles and 1,164,099 tons of stores.4. At Cherbourg the Bassin a Flot and the Avant Port du Commerce were reported clear of mines on the 14th. Eight ships have arrived and are unloadinggear for the clearance of the port.5. H.M. ships Mauritius, Enterprise (cruisers) and Roberts (monitor)bombarded enemy positions in support of the Army on the 18th. Mauritius and enterprise also successfully bombarded mortar positions on the following day.6. On the night of the 14th/ 15th, three M.T.Bs intercepted a force ofE-boats off Havre, set one on fire and chased the remainder back to port. Laterthree other M.T.Bs engaged and damaged a trawler and two patrol craft at closerange. In a subsequent action with three enemy craft the M.T.Bs were heavilyengaged both by ships and shore batteries : one M.T.B. sustained damage. Onthe following night three M.T.Bs engaged three R-boats off Havre and inflictedcasualties on the enemy : some damage was caused to the M.T.Bs. On the night of the 17th/18th, minelaying craft attacked three enemy trawlers off Dunkirkand inflicted damage. On the same night M.T.Bs attacked three E/R-boats offBoulogne, and subsequently two groups of trawlers, causing damage in bothengagements. Also on the same night M.T.Bs set two R-boats on fire off Berckand caused damage to seven others. Early on the 19th, two M.T.Bs damagedR-boats north-east of Cap d&apos;Antifer and French M.T.Bs engaged five R-boatsto the westward.7. On the night of the 14th/15th H.M.S. Tartar and H.M.C.S. Haida(destroyers) with the Polish destroyer Blyskaivica, while reconnoitring the french coast, intercepted a trawler towing a battle practice target and two small cargo ships 50 miles south of Brest. One cargo ship and the trawler were sunk and theother ship was left on fire.8. On the night of the 13th/14th M.T.Bs attacked a convoy of three trawlersoff Ijmuiden and sank one of them, under heavy fire : three M.T.Bs were damaged.9. On the 12th, H.M.S. Gozo (minesweeper) was damaged by ,a mine.H.M.S. Frobisher (cruiser) was bombed and damaged in the assault area on the18th : there were 18 casualties including 8 killed. H.M.S. Jason (minesweeper)was damaged, probably by mine, on the same day.Mediterranean.10. U.S. M.T.Bs. operating off the Riviera, with H.M. ships Terpsichoreand Kimberley (destroyers), sank a small craft on the night of the 15th/16th.11. Coastal forces on the night of the 12th/13th attacked two A/S boats off Vado (25 miles S.W. of Genoa) and forced one of them ashore.   Other coastal
2QGforces, on the same night, attacked three F-lighters escorted by R-boats south-east of Spezia; one U.S. M.T.B. was damaged by a mine. Two nights later coastalforces off Spezia torpedoed one lighter and possibly a second. In the Gulf ofGenoa other lighters were attacked and two were forced ashore.The TJ.S.S. Swerve (minesweeper) was mined and sunk on the 9th off Anzio.12. In the Adriatic, a commando force was landed on Hvar Island on the night of the 11th/12th. A German patrol was ambushed and the force withdrewwith 15 prisoners. -13. In the iEgean a raiding force was landed on Symi Island (N.W. ofRhodes) on the night of the 12th/13th and the succeeding night. Enemy strong-points were destroyed and 165 German and Italian prisoners were taken. Twominesweeping craft and two large caiques were captured. In addition, 600 tonsof shipping was destroyed on the building slips, which were demolished, and covering coastal forces attacked and drove ashore two large lighters. All our troops were safely withdrawn on the night of the 15th/16th.H.M. S/M. Vow, while on patrol in the iEgean, torpedoed a 1,200-ton shipon the 10th. &apos;East Indies.14. H.M. submarines have reported the following : Sturdy, on patrol inthe Malacca Strait, sank by gunfire on the 4th a 300-ton tug with two lightersin tow and a smaller tug towing a lighter. On the 6th she sank the Puket-Kantang ferry, of 200 tons, which was carrying about 200 passengers. Sturdyalso sank four junks in the course of the patrol. Porpoise in the Malacca Straiton the 6th sank a tug and took prisoners. Sea Rover sank three junks during a recent patrol in the Strait and took prisoners. Spirit shelled and damaged a400-ton tanker south-east of Sabang.Pacific.M arianas.15. In addition to attacks by carrier-borne aircraft on enemy positions inthe Islands (referred to in the Air Situation) a bombardment of palestinian wascarried out on the 13th by U.S. cruisers and destroyers. On the same dayManiagassa Island, off Saipan; was captured by U.S. Marines.New Guinea.16. On the 14th, Australian cruisers with Australian and U.S. destroyers bombarded gun positions, supply dumps and troop concentrations east of Aitape.On the 15th, an Australian destroyer shelled and destroyed the radio station atAta Abu (west of Wewak). Two days later, Allied cruisers and destroyerscarried out a bombardment in the Boroam-Cape Mo.em area (west of Hansa Bay).Anti-Submarine Operations.17. Twenty-three attacks have been made during the week. Of these, tenwere by shore-based aircraft, two by carrier-borne aircraft and eleven by warships.On the 11th, one U-boat was probably sunk by a Sunderland in the Bay of Biscayand another on the 17th by a Liberator west of Narvik. On the 15th a U-boat was possibly sunk by H.M.S. Affleck (frigate) in the western Channel.Enemy Intelligence.18. Photographic reconnaissance on the 19th showed the nurnberg and thetwo Schlesien class battleships at Gdynia; the Leipzig at Swinemunde and theGraf Zeppelin at Stettin.19. It is reported that the pilots of the human torpedoes engaged in the two operations off Houlgate comprised all the trained men of the First One-manTorpedo Flotilla. A second flotilla of about 30 men is now training in NorthGermany and may be ready to operate at the beginning of August.[27857] B
U-boats.20. In the English Channel there are estimated to be three or four U-boats,all of which may be in the western sector, not in the actual shipping channels.21. The special U-boats built for the transport of torpedoes have a maximumcapacity of 44 torpedoes and an endurance of 20,000 miles at ten knots. Theywere intended to supply operational groups of U-boats but are now being usedfor transport purposes to the Far East and also to U-boats in Norwegian waters.Of the four known to have been built one has been sunk on passage to Penang.Enemy Attack on Shipping.22. Two ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during thewreek. One ship was sunk while on passage from Durban to Beira, and the other,on passage from Bombay to Colombo, was sunk off Goa.Protection of Seaborne Trade.23. During the week ending the 16th, 855 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 361 were in ocean convoys and494 in British coastal convoys. Four escort carriers (including one U.S. carrier),29 destroyers (including 13 U.S. destroyers) and 86 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties. Four homebound convoys, consistingof 193 ships, and four outward-bound convoys, consisting of 168 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.24. Mines have been laid by ships off the northern coast of France and alsoin the Strait of Malacca. Aircraft have laid mines in the Baltic and the heligoland Bight and off the Frisian Islands and the Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.25. The number of enemy aircraft engaged in minelaying in the assaultarea appears to have increased during the past ten days. A number of the mines have exploded on being dropped. Ninety-six ground mines have been destroyed during the week and 35 were self-destroyed, nearly all in the eastern sector. AtCherbourg four ground and nine moored mines were destroyed. Since the invasion 404 ground and 264 moored have been destroyed in addition to. 169ground mines self-destroyed.There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft in. Home Waters.26.   During recent operations one minesweeping flotilla destroyed 120moored mines in clearing a channel from Civita Vecchia to San Stefano.The mine totals are 5,155 ground and 5,416 moored.27. In the Nore Command during the period the 1st January to 30th June,there was a great reduction in minelaying by enemy aircraft but an increase inminelaying by E-boats. The totals destroyed during the period were 143 ground and 90 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.28. During the period the 16th to 30th June, ten enemy ships (50,882 tons)were sunk, captured or became constructive total losses : of these, five (34,000 tons)were lost in the Mediterranean and two ships were seriously damaged. Thisbrings enemy casualties for June up to 20 ships (80,391 tons) of which elevenships (44,945 tons) were lost in the Mediterranean. Six ships (14,517 tons) were seriously damaged.29. It is reported that 1,100,000 tons of shipping are at present operating in the Baltic on enemy account. Of these, 326,000 tons are German, 131,000 tonsDanish, 265,000 tons Finnish and 360,000 tons Swedish.30. The marked drop in Swedish exports of iron ore to Germany in Maywas maintained in June: the figures were approximately half those of June 1943.31. The amount of ore imported by Germany from Spain through biscay ports during the first five months of 1944 is estimated to have been about
230,000 tons : of this, 106,000 tons were carried by the larger ships to Bordeauxand 124,000 tons by the smaller ships to Bayonne. There have been two sailingsfrom Bilbao and one arrival of the larger ships engaged in the trade duringthe week.Russian Intelligence.32. On the 16th July, six of H.M. destroyers were transferred to theRussian Navy. These were H.M. ships Brighton, Chelsea, Churchill,Leamington, Richmond and St. Albans, which have been renamed Fiery, Saucy,Active, Scorcher, Lively and Worthy.33. In the Black Sea the Russian heavy ships remain, as far as is known,at Poti and Batum. The main activity of the Black Sea Fleet is to sweep mineslaid by German aircraft near the northern Black Sea ports, between Odessa andSevastopol.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.34. Save for the capture by the Russians of Suojarvi, between Lakes Onegaand Ladoga, there has been little activity on the Finnish front.Northern Sector.35. The Russian offensive has now spread to the northern sector, wherethe Russians are advancing astride the railway Veiikie Luki-Riga and have crossed the Latvian frontier. They have also made progress on a wide frontsouth of Ostrov.Central Sector.36. The Russians have continued to make steady progress along the whole front of some 250 miles. They are now within 25 miles of Kovno, and south ofthe town they have reached the Niemen on a 75-mile front and established anumber of bridgeheads, which the Germans are endeavouring to eliminate.Grodno has fallen and the Russians are about 20 miles east of Bialystok and17 miles N.E. of Brest Litovsk. The railway, from this point eastwards throughthe Pripet Marshes, is now entirely in Russian hands.In the Pripet Marshes area the Dnieper River Flotilla of gunboats andlaunches gave close support to the Army.Southern Sector.37. South of the Marshes the Russians launched a new offensive on the 15th,and have advanced up to 30 miles on a front of 125 miles, capturing Krasneand a railway junction 25 miles N.E. of Lwow.General.38. The offensive in the Central Sector having brought the Russian linelevel with, or slightly ahead of, their line from Kowel southwards, the russians have now struck in this latter area towards Lublin and Lwow. This has notmeant a halt in the centre, where progress is still being made. Consequently theGermans, already stretched and unable to hold the Russian advance in the centre,have now to face an offensive along the whole front from Ostrov to Tarnopol .some 530 miles as the crow flies. At some points the Russians have alreadycrossed the Niemen and the upper reaches of the Bug, thus breaching one of thereputed German defence lines.Reports from the front emphasize the excellence of Russian morale and statethat the Germans now recognise the overwhelming Russian superiority in menand material.North-West France.   (An outline niap is included as an inset).General.39. During the past week, the First U.S. Army, in their offensive at the base of the Cherbourg Peninsula, have steadily advanced south and have practi-cally reached the Lessay-St. Lo highway.  St. Lo itself is in our hands.[27857] b 2
In the British Sector an armoured attack which was launched to the east ofCaen has penetrated five miles south into enemy country, reaching Bourgebusand Cagny.US. Sector.40. Considerably hampered by the close and marshy nature of the country which has confined attacks to limited routes of approach, the offensive of theFirst U.S. Army has made limited gains from day to day against stiff oppositionthroughout the week towards the important lateral highway Lessay-Periers-St. Lo. Fairly rapid progress near the coast brought U.S. troops to the northbank of the River Ay (exclusive of Lessay) by mid-day on the 15th. Towardsthe centre of the peninsula the advance down the Carentan-Periers road, and the widening of the bridgehead across the River Vire, had the effect of straighteningout the general line and eliminating resistance in the flooded areas south ofCarentan; the axis of advance then swung south and forward troops on an eight-mile front have reached the Lessay-St. Lo highway west of St. Lo and furthereast are within three miles of this objective. The important communications centre of St. Lo was stubbornly defended by the enemy, and. although outflanked tothe east on the 13th, it was only after fierce street fighting that the town was finally captured on the 18th.British Sector.41. After the capture of Caen and the expansion of the Odon bridgeheadeastwards towards the River Orne, considerable re-organisation took place withinthe Second British Army, and operations were limited to the holding of theground which had been won, in the face of continuous enemy counter-attacks and heavy shell-fire.In the early hours of the 16th, this lull was broken, when attacks were launched to the west and south of the Odon bridgehead against Noyers, Bougyand EsqUay. Good progress was made against strong opposition. Esquay was captured; advances towards the other two villages were made and a large partof the available enemy armour was attracted to the area where it became heavilyinvolved. Reports from the Hottot area, where a subsequent advance of abouta mile was made, suggest that the enemy are thinning out their forces in this sector and have withdrawn south of the Caumont-Tilly road.At dawn on the 18th. preceded by very heavy concentrated bombing attacksto the east of Caen (see para 52 of Air Situation), an armoured attack was launched from the north between Caen and Touffreville. This attack passed through the &quot; corridor &quot; left by the bombers and drove south, fanning out S.W.and S.E. to Bourgebus and Cagny which were reached by the afternoon of the 18th.With the armoured thrust well under way, Canadian troops attacking acrossthe River Orne captured Faubourg cle Vaucelles the south-eastern suburb ofCaen, and, on the following day, Fleury two miles to the south was taken, whileBritish infantry attacking villages to the south and south-east of Touffrevillereached the outskirts of Troan. A substantial salient has thus been consolidatedwhich extends south from Caen to Bourgebus and east from the River Orne toCagny.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)42. Last week, the enemy were reported to be defending the approaches to Ancona, Arezzo and Leghorn with grim determination. The period underreview has seen a considerable change, culminating in the capture of these threeplaces. It appears unlikely that the enemy will be able to stage a major delayingaction on the line of the River Arno.In the Adriatic sector, held by the Poles, a fully co-ordinated attack wasnecessary to break through the enemy&apos;s resistance south of Ancona. This attackcame on the morning of the 17th and had a quick success. By the 18th, patrolshad reached the middle of Ancona, and the following day, advancing N.W. ofthe town, they cut the Ancona-Rimini road and established two bridgeheads overthe River Esino, east of the village of Chiaravalle. Here they are again meeting with stiff German resistance.The central Corps of the Eighth Army has continued to push northwardsfrom Umbertide, and latest reports speak of our troops being just south of CitaDi Castello, which is on the same latitude as Arezzo.The left-hand Corps of the Eighth Army launched an attack on the night of the 14th/15th with the object of breaking through the enemy&apos;s defences covering
Arezzo and the road to Florence. The thrust towards Arezzo itself was carriedout by a British armoured division, and after some hard fighting for the heightsto the S.W., the city fell on the 16th. At the same time as this advance was beingmade, a Dominions armoured formation was pressing forward to the left of theArmy flank in the direction of Radda, which lies on the lateral road betweenArezzo and Poggibonsi. By the 19th, advances all along this Corps front had brought Montevarchi and Radda into our possession, and the British line is hereabout 18 miles south of Florence.French forces operating on the right flank of the Fifth Army have been, steadily pushing back the enemy, who seems to have been withdrawing rather morev readily in this sector. Poggibonsi was reached on the 14th; and after beatingoff two sharp counter-attacks north of the town, French forces continued the follow-up of the enemy withdrawal until, on the 19th, they were also roughly18 miles from Florence.On the left of the French, troops of a U.S. Corps have made good progress.Maintaining steady pressure north of Volterra, they advanced astride the road to Pontedera, which is an important rail and road junction east of Pisa. our patrols are now up to the River Arno from Pontedera to Castelfranco.Meanwhile the left-handed thrust secured us Leghorn on the 18th, after several days.&apos; severe fighting on the approaches.Yugoslavia.43. Confused fighting has been going on 30 miles north of Zara in the areaof Gospic.There has been a remarkable increase in railway sabotage by the Partisansin recent weeks. Only eight trains ran on the Zagreb-Belgrade line in the firstten days of June. Other important routes which have been interrupted includethe line Celje-Maribor, which leads into Austria, and that from Virovitica intoHungary. On the line north of Nis there has been no night traffic since the6th June.Greece.44.   Zervas has continued his offensive in the Epirus.On the night of the 7th/8th, E.L.A.S. attacked German forces in theMount Olympus area.Albania.45. An Albanian Partisan brigade fighting in co-operation with Tito&apos;forces occupied temporarily Debar (Dibra) (40 miles east of Tirana).Burma.46. Operations to clear the remaining Japanese from the areas south andS.E. of Ukhrul have continued. *The village of Sakok, 18 miles south of Ukhrul, was taken on the 17th bytroops moving eastwards from the Kohima-Imphal road.On the 16th, a village five miles south of Bishenpur was captured by our troops; the enemy had departed in haste and had left behind 14 tanks and afew guns.New Guinea.47.   The Japanese troops trapped in the Wewak area made a determinedattack against the U.S. perimeter at Aitape on the 10th.   They achieved some,    penetration, but by the 12th the situation was restored; further Japanese attacks1    on the 14th and 16th were repulsed.U.S. forces operating in the Maffin Bay area have captured Sawar airfield,three miles west of Maffin.AIR SITUATION.General Review.48. Home-based aircraft gave full support to Allied troops in Normandy,and heavily attacked industrial targets in Germany and communications and flying-bomb sites in France.
s111 Italy, successful attacks were made on enemy communications. oil installations were attacked by heavy bombers.There was a further reduction in the number of flying-bombs launched.United Kingdom.49. One enemy aircraft flew over the London area at night. Flying-bomb attacks are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and Home Security.&quot;Home Waters.50. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,227 sorties during theweek; ten aircraft are missing.On the 15th, 45 Beaufighters attacked a large convoy off the south coast of norway; a 3,000-ton merchant ship blew up, another 3,000-ton ship, a 3,000-tontanker and three trawler-type auxiliaries were set on fire, a 5,000-ton ship was torpedoed and an armed coaster was sunk. All our aircraft returned safely. Inthe Bay of Biscay, Mosquitoes attacked two 800-ton coasters, both of which were left burning.On the night of the 18th/19th, 45 torpedo and R.P. Beaufighters attacked acmvoy off nor deney; one ship was torpedoed, another was damaged by R.P., oneescort vessel blew up, two more were set on fire and a further two were damaged.Two Beaufighters are missing.Bomber Command aircraft laid 170 sea-mines.Western Front.51. Although bad weather conditions curtailed offensive operations on thefirst three days of the week, aircraft of the A.E.A.F., the Eighth U.S. Air Forceand Bomber Command flew 11,565, 9,783 and 4,284 sorties and dropped 3,487,11,528 and 12,706 tons of bombs respectively. Enemy losses in combat wrere. 192aircraft destroyed, 26 probably destroyed and 92 damaged; 113 Allied bombers and 91 fighters and fighter-bombers are missing.^France.52. The main feature of the week was a heavy attack made by allied aircraft, on the morning of the 18th, on enemy targets in the Caen area, insupport of our troops. Bomber Command aircraft dropped over 5,000 tons of bombs, aircraft of the Eighth U.S. Air Force nearly 1,400 tons and aircraft ofthe A.E.A.F. 650 tons. Visibility was excellent at the start, but as the attackprogressed the targets were covered with smoke; the bombing was concentratedand intense. Flak was heavy at the outset, but it gradually died away. Not asingle enemy fighter attempted to intervene in the early stages of the attack and only eight Allied bombers were lost. Many hundreds of Allied fighters and fighter-bombers, based in Normandy and Southern England, co-operated withour troops throughout the day, bombing and machine-gunning any target theyobserved. Enemy fighters were about to make a belated intervention in the battle when Allied fighters intercepted them as they were taking off from twoairfields to the south of the Battle Area and a number was shot down.Throughout the week, heavy attacks were made on enemy communications,5,400 tons being dropped and 2,500 rocket projectiles fired. The principal targets were the railway centres at Revigny-sur-Marne (564 tons), Nevers (553 tons),Aulnoye (525 tons), Villeneuve-Saint-Georges (432 tons), Chalons-sur-Marne(404 tons) and Vaires (364 tons), and 12 railway bridges east and south of Paris,on which 911 tons were dropped. A large number of locomotives, a considerable quantity of rolling stock, many tanks and A.F.Vs. and several bridges were destroyed or damaged.Successful attacks were made on fuel dumps in northern France, on which688 tons of bombs were dropped and at which 586 rocket projectiles were fired,and on about six airfields, on which 232 tons were dropped. Three hundred andtwenty Fortresses dropped supplies to patriots in France.Day and night attacks were made on flying-bomb launching sites in the pas-de-Calais and in the Dieppe/Rouen and Abbeville/Amiens areas and onflying-bomb supply dumps at Thiverny (25 miles N. of Paris), Nucourt (25 miles .W. of Paris) and near Rheims, nearly 3,700 tons of bombs being dropped.* The results of some of the attacks referred to above are given in Appendix VII.
Germany.53. Home-based Fortresses and Liberators made three heavy daylight attacks on targets in southern and south-western Germany. Nearly 1,900 tons were dropped on targets in and near Munich, including an aero-engine works and anoxygen works, about 2,000 tons on the railway centre and other objectives atSaarbriicken, 550 tons on Stuttgart, 510 tons on aircraft factories and other targets at Augsburg and Kempten (40 miles N.E. of Friedrichshafen), 490 tonson two ball-bearing works at Schweinfurt and Bamberg, 520 tons on four airfields in the Ulm and Stuttgart areas, 440 tons on railway centres at Strasbourg, Ulm,Coblenz and Karthaus and 140 tons on other targets.Targets in northern Germany were attacked by Fortresses 960 tons being dropped on the experimental stations at Peenemunde and Zinnowitz, on the Balticcoast. 220 tons on the port area at Kiel, 119 tons on Hemmingstedt oil refineryand 110 tons on Cuxhaven.Bomber Command aircraft, in a night attack, dropped nearly 1,500 tons of bombs on synthetic oil plants at Buer and Wesseling (near Cologne), goodconcentrations of bombing being achieved. A total of 209 Mosquitoes dropped121 tons on Berlin. 63 tons on Hanover, 61 tons on Homberg and 64 tons on other targets.Mediterranean Front.54. During the week ended dawn on the ISth, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 13,923 sorties, of which 2,747 were heavy bombers, and dropped 10,089 tons of bombs; 102 Allied aircraft are missing and 87 enemy aircraft were destroyed..Attacks were made by heavy bombers on oil installations and other targets in the Balkans, north Italy and south of France. Some enemy opposition was encountered and 58 heavy bombers are missing.Italy.55. The Tactical Air Force concentrated on road and railway communica-tions in north Italy, and also provided close support for the Army in the battle area.Numerous attacks, in most instances carried out by medium bombers, weremade on bridges, with most satisfactory results. On the 13th, six railway bridgesacross the River Po were bombed by 135 Mitchells with excellent results, and onthe same day a somewhat larger force of Mitchells obtained direct hits on sixbridges in the Ferrara/Mantua areas. On the 15th and 16th, Po Valley bridgeswere again attacked and in at least ten instances serious damage was caused.Other strikes were made against five bridges in the Turin/Milan area, all ofwhich were hit, in the Florence/Bologna areas, where nine bridges were destroyed or damaged, and north of the River Po, where three bridges were rendered unservicable.Fighter-bombers swept a large area from the battle front to the north; enemyM.T., dumps, gun positions, roads and railways were freely attacked; on one dayalone, roads were reported cut in 29 places and railway lines in 41 places.At night, light bombers attacked enemy M/T and communications in the battle area and Wellingtons made a heavy raid on the Milan railway centre and a smaller one at Brescia.U.S. heavy bombers attacked railway centres at Verona, Mantua, Brescia andMestre, oil installations at Porto Marghera and Trieste, and a railway bridge atPenzana. A total of 1,044 tons was released and in each instance the targets were hit and serious damage was caused.Hungary, Rumania, Austria and Yugoslavia.56. A heavy scale of effort was maintained against oil installations andrefineries. In Hungary, attacks were made on the Fan to, Shell and PetfurdoOil Refineries and on the Hungarian Petroleum works; a total of 607 tons was dropped with good results. In Rumania a total of 1,349 tons was dropped onsix oil properties in the Ploesti area. Near Vienna, the Winterhafen oil installa-tion was bombed. In Yugoslavia, Wellingtons attacked the Brod and SmiderevoOil Refineries.Good results were reported from a raid on the Budapest/Ferencvaros railway centre, by 105 Liberators. In the Vienna area, the Vienna railway centre was attacked, also the Wien/Munchendorf airfield and an aero engine factory atWiener Neudorf (338 tons).

Attacks on this country with flying-bombs in the early part of the weekcontinued on a further reduced scale, but on the last two days and nights they were increased to average intensity and a number appear to have been launched fromsites in Belgium. There was a lull on Saturday morning and another of some15 hours&apos; duration from 1100 on Monday. Activity in London was slight on thenights of Thursday/Friday and Friday/Saturday, but&apos;on the latter night anattack was made on the Southampton/Portsmouth area. Six fell in Hampshireon other nights, six in East Suffolk, six in Essex (mostly in the South), two inHertfordshire and two in Buckinghamshire; otherwise those outside Londonfell or were shot down in the South-Eastern Counties.In London there was a slight preponderance south of the Thames, but therewas a tendency for the fall of bombs to shift further to the north-east, includingthe central districts.The total number of flying-bombs launched during the week was 513 of which224 were destroyed, compared with 699 launched and 373 destroyed in the weekbefore.Damage.68. Damage to factories of national importance wras again of little account;in two cases production was stopped. In the majority of 12 incidents involvingrailways, services were resumed in 24 hours; at St. Marylebone Station, hit onthe 17th, three out of four platforms were in use next day. Damage to docks hasbeen fairly extensive but no serious effect on shipping facilities has been reported.In incidents affecting utility undertakings, service to priority consumers has notbeen seriously interrupted. Damage has been mainly to house property and once again, notably, to hospitals. Battersea General Hospital (damaged on the 19th)is at present unable to accept further casualties.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.France.Caen Area. Photographs, taken after the attack on the 18th July, show-that the Caen/Mondeville steelworks have now been virtually destroyed. this area was almost completely covered with craters in a uniform density with aspread of an additional 700 yards or so to the north.The target area at Sanneryille and Manneville measured approximately4,000 yards by 800 yards and this was also largely covered with craters exceptfor an area on the west side. There is also a wider spread to the east for about700 yards through its entire length.The target area at Cagny was a circle with a radius of 600 yards and waswell hit, and many large flat blast marks are well spread all over the area. Thereis a slight spread to the west and south.CMdons-sur-MaTne Railway Centre. A preliminary interpretation of photographs, taken after the attack on the 15th/16th July, shows a heavy concen-tration of craters just outside and to the north of the yard. Some sheds in the storage sidings have been destroyed and a moderate quantity of rolling stockhas been destroyed or damaged.Cidmont-Chalindrey Railway Centre. Photographs, taken after the bomber command attack on the 12th/13th July, show a scene of devastation in the target area. The locomotive sheds and repair shops have all been destroyed or guttedand 20 locomotives are seen to be damaged in the former site of the locomotiveshed,. About 25 wagons have also been damaged. In the station sidings all line shave been blocked by craters and the tracks leading to the engine shed have all beentorn up. The through running lines to Dijon, Chaumont and Belfort, the con-striction of lines at the south end of the target, and the single track loop-line from the Chaumont line, have all been cut in many places. A flyover has been damaged by a direct hit.Messel I St. Gervais. Photographs, taken after the A.E.A.F. attack on the11th July, show that five buildings of the ammunition factory have been almost completely destroyed, while others have received severe roof damage. In addition,all the railway lines from Flers to Briouze have been cut and considerable damage has been caused in the sidings at the factory.Nevers Railway Junction. Photographs show that the junction of the paris-Le Creusot lines is completely cut by at least eight direct hits. All tracksin both railway sidings have been cut and a large number of wagons destroyed or damaged. Damage has also been caused to both locomotive roundhouses and toat least ten locomotives. Two transhipment sheds have been destroyed and oneseverely damaged, and there is a concentration of craters across the end of thenorth sidings.Revigny-sur-Ornain Railway Junction. A preliminary interpretation of photographs shows the results of the attacks of the 12/13th, 14th/15th,18th/ 19th July. A stick of bombs lies along the tracks adjacent to the aiming point and another stick lies across the middle of the nearby marshalling yard in theN.S. direction. ^The bulk of the attack has fallen south of the marshalling yard with the approximate centre at 800 yards 0950 from the aiming point.Tours Railway Junction. Photographs, taken after the Bomber command attack on 12th/13th July, show a very large concentration of craters in the target area which lies south-east of Tours passenger station. All tracks have been cut at the gathering point, the road over rail bridge has collapsed, and the approaches to the bridge have been obliterated. In the storage sidings thereis another very closely packed concentration of craters destroying a large amountof rolling-stock and damaging the engine roundhouse and several heaps of openstores.   Many overhead cable standards have been destroyed.
Vaires Railway Centre. A preliminary interpretation of photographs, taken on the 18th July, shows that the weight of the attack fell, as in the attack of the7tih/8th July, on the central and eastern sections of the marshalling yards. Agreat concentration of bombs produced very heavy damage to rolling-stock andtracks, and the main lines again deceived many hits. The three most easterlybays of the transhipment shed, are now virtually destroyed.Wizernes Flying-bomb Site. This large site was attacked on the 17th Julyin practically clear weather. 12,000-lb. bombs were dropped and craters fromseven of these can be seen. The large bucket-hoist on the west of the dome andthe ramp leading from the dome centre to the S.E. have both disappeared.Germany.Berlin. -Further photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the21st June, cover most of the south and south-western parts of the city and someof the central area.A number of fresh items of damage can be seen in the central area and buildings affected include the Anhalter station, the market hall in Encko Strasse,and some large office blocks, several of them premises of printing and bookbindingfirms.There is further industrial damage in Tempelhof, and some of the airfieldsheds have also been involved.In Mitte, the former palace of the ex-Crown Prince in Oberwall St. is oneof the buildings damaged.Buer Synthetic Oil Plant. Preliminary interpretation of poor-qualityphotographs, taken on the 19th July, shows several points of substantial newdamage to the north hydrogenation stalls and to buildings adjoining the gaspurification plant, and to a number of buildings in the southern half of the target. There are no definite signs of activity in the plant and no industrialsmoke.
