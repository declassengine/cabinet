THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet. June 1944.SECRET. Copy fio.^W.P. (44) 353.- 28th June, 1944.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. The Governments proposals on social insurance involve a heavy increasein the expenditure to be borne by the community, partly as taxpayers,, partly ascontributing employers, partly as contributing workers. In total the increase isappreciably bigger than that involved in any other of the post-war commitmentswe are considering. I must, therefore, bring their financial implications speciallyto the notice of my colleagues. in their relation to post-war prospects on revenue and expenditure.   It is true that part of this increase, which in 1945 will total1 some  224 million and. will grow to much larger sums later on,, will be offset bya reduction-in the private expenditure of individuals, e.g., on medical attention:,and private insurances. It is true, also, that virtually the whole of the vast sum to be collected each year will be divided out to members of the community, and&apos; -the problem is therefore one of transference of income within the community.Nevertheless, a problem of transference is still a problem when the sumsinvolvedare as high as they are here, and when there is a big difference between.the sums- paid and received by particular individuals. It is the case that the portion tobe borne by, the taxpayer will present itself to him as one important element ina tax burden which he may yet come to regard as almost intolerable, the part to&apos; be contributed by employers will present itself to the employers as an increasedburden upon industry,, and the part to be furnished as contribution by. thebeneficiaries will, in the case of people with small incomes, present itself as avery heavy dip into their valuable weekly funds and will constitute a burden which, though they may willingly bear it because of the benefits with whichitheywill associate it, may yet render them much less willing than otherwise tojbeartheir proper share of the general taxation which, must be collected to meet&apos; allthe obligations and undertakings of the State in the&quot; post-war world.; . Accordingly,I must look at the scheme as a whole and consider not only the direct budgetaryexpenditure but also the,contributions which,are semi-budgetary, and it is inthat light that I examine it in the following note : L-^-The Social and Industrial Iytjury Insurance Plans (including family allowances and the National Health Service).2. The Government [scheme involves total expenditure as follows(retaining 1945 as its first full year post-war for continuity of presentationalthough the assumption that it will be in operation in that year cannot now berealised) : .  million.1945    ...............      ... 6731955    ...      ...      ...      ,.......     ,..     ,   754.   1965    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 8191975    ...      ...      ...........   .....      854&apos; &quot; On the basis of the Services as they exist to-day, the income (*.(?., the aggregate of tax charges, rate charges,- contributions of workers and employers and interest- ,! on investments) from which the Social Insurance Services as, a whole\would bemet iml945iwould be  449 million.. In 1938-39 it was  342 million.   (^ihce(l938[27723]    -;; b
there have been various changes in the law. If, for the purpose of illustration,one assumed that none of these changes had taken place, and nothing had beendone between 1938 and 1945 except to increase the 1938 rates of benefit by 30 percent, to compensate for a rise in the cost of living, the 1945 figure, allowing forthe increase in the numbers of pensioners, would have been in the region of 450 million.)3. The contributions of employers under the proposed scheme, amount to 124 million a year as against  87 million under the existing schemes in 1945and  66 million in 1938-39. Those of workers amount to  178 million a year asagainst  69 million under the existing schemes in 1945 and  55 million in1938-39.4. Assuming that, by and large, local rates continue to bear  75 million ayear throughout, the charge on the taxpayer is  281 million in 1945 ( 365 million in 1955,  435 million&apos; in 1965 and  486 million in 1975) as against  203 million in 1945 on the existing basis and  137 million in 1938.5. In the first year of the Scheme employers would have to face an increaseof  37 million over what they would have provided in that year without theScheme; workers would have to face an increase of  109 million on the same basis. These figures would remain fairly constant over the years. Taxpayers onthe same basis will face an increase of  78 million in 19455  162 million in 1955, 232 million in 1965 and  283 million in 1975. It may be well to bear in mind that taxpayers, workers and employers are not always distinct persons.II. Financial Commitments generally.6. My predecessor submitted to the Reconstruction Problems Committee andthe Reconstruction Priorities Committee a number of papers on the financial aspects of the Social. Security Plan (as it was then called) (R.P. (43) 5 and pr.R. (43) 8), on the National Income (P.R. (43) 35) and on Post-War national income and Taxation (P.R. (43) 36). I supplemented these papers with later information on certain new services and commitments after the war inP.R. (43) 97.7.   The position disclosed by these papers may be summarised as follows : The late Chancellor indicated that, in order to make progress, he was prepared to take  7,000 million as a working basis for the net post-war national income. This means a taxable national income of  7,825 million. On this basis,and assuming that all current taxation was kept in full force, except E.P.T. andthe post-war credit portion of income tax, he estimated a yield of taxation of 2,300 million. These figures related to the year 1948 and assumed a level ofprices 35 per cent, above pre-war.Allowing  1,175 million as the estimate of budgetary costs which werecommitments under existing policy, the above figure for revenue disclosed a margin of  1,125 million to meet (a) Any corrections required by a failure of the taxable national incomje toreach  7,825 million;(6) The post-war cost of the armed forces;(c) Sinking Fund, which, subject possibly to some postponement whiledefence costs were very high, could not reasonablv be put at less than 100 million;(d) New services and new commitments of all kinds, for which (as an under-estimate rather than an over-estimate) not less than  100 million,rising as the years progressed, was assigned, exclusive of the extra costof the Social Security plan;and last but not least (e) Remission of severe war-time rates of taxation.8. These estimates were, however, made a year ago, and developments in theyear have substantially altered the general picture : (a) The estimate for the National Debt Interest assumed that the war would end on the 31st March, 1944. If we now assume that it will end in Europe onthe 31st December, 1944, and in the Far East on the 31st December, 1945, andif we allow  500 million for expenditure on demobilisation grants, the item for interest on the debt must be increased by  50 million a year.
(b) New commitments (apart from the Social Insurance Schemes andassociated services, i.e., Family Allowances and the National Health Service)which have taken shape or are under consideration are now likely to involve agreat increase in the allowance of  100 million. I have not thought it necessary at this stage.to undertake a re-calculation of the cost of the items which made up the budgetary figures of expenditure for commitments under existing policyand new commitments prepared a year ago. The general tendency on these itemshas been upwards. I have restricted the following list to items which are new,either in the sense that they were not included at all a year ago or in the sense that there has been, or is in prospect, some specific change of substance:  m.Per annum.(a) Reconstruction of war-damaged areas (grants for loan charges for two years on acquisition and clearance costs of 575 million diminishing thereafter as reconstructionproceeds) ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      25(b) Increases in supplementary pension rates and unemployment assistance (on the same assumptions as to numbers unemployed and on pension as are made in the social insurance White Paper)      ...      ...      ...      ....      ...      13(Note. This item represents the increases made lastyear, and enters into the cost on existing basis in 1945 by reference to which the extra cost of the Social InsuranceScheme has been calculated. It is therefore an itemadditional to that extra cost, and not a part of it.)(c) Free school meals and milk.    (This figure will rise to 25 million when the scheme is fully developed)......      10(d) Temporary houses (on the assumption that there are 200,000,with an effective life of 10 years)   ...      ...      ...      ...        9(e) Training and rehabilitation(/) War Pensions      ...      ......(g) Pensions (Increase) Act ...      ......(Note. &apos;The total cost involved in the was included in the estimates mentioned in paragraph 7partly among the commitments under existing policy andpartly in the allowance for new commitments. This costincluded the cost of school meals and milk on the present basis under which a charge is made for the service.)Besides these specific items, there are other schemes in prospect for which figures cannot as yet be given, such as re-equipment grants to industry andinducements on location. Then there are a number of miscellaneous items which amount to a substantial sum in total. There are also more remote possibilities,such as that of a rise in teachers&apos; salaries generally following the McNair Report.Further, the recent trend of prices suggests that the original assumption thatthe cost of living can be stabilised at about 35 per cent, above pre-war withoutappreciable subsidy (apart from assistance to home agriculture) will not berealised and for this item, including assistance to agriculture, perhaps 30 million a year will be required over and above the figure originally taken.. On balance, I doubt whether the total allowance for new commitments can safely be put at less than  200 million in place of the  100 million alreadyallowed,9. Allowing for the revised estimate of the National Debt interest and forhew commitments of  200 million, we have a margin of  875 million, availablefor (a) Any correction required by a failure of the national income to reach 7,825 million.(b) The post-war cost of the armed forces.(c) Sinking Fund.(d) The Social Security Plan.(e) Remissions of taxation. . - \If we ignore (a), allow nothing for (c), so long as the cost of the armed forces remains high, take (d) at  78 million, we are left with  800 million ayear in round figures for the cost of national security and for remissions ofwar-time rates of taxation.[27723] b 2........ 12......... 8&apos;..      ...      ... education Bill
III.&apos; General Considerations.10. I need not at this stage recapitulate all the considerations in my predecessor^ memoranda. It is quite clear from them that any such marginwould be wholly inadequate to meet the cost of the armed forces and theremissions of taxation which will be necessary to encourage the revival * ofindustrial enterprise and also as a measure of prudence having regard to the growing difficulties of raising large sums in taxation, as income becomes more widely distributed. In this connexion, the big increase of workers&apos; contribu-tions in the Social Insurance Scheme is important. As illustrating the sums involved in tax remissions, Income Tax produces roughly  100 million for eachshilling. To reduce the beer and tobacco duties to their pre-war rates would cost about  400 million. To remit the increases of those duties imposed in the1943 Budget the last increases would cost about  100 million. Purchase Taxis included in the estimate of post-war revenue at  150 million.11. The main unknown element in the expenditure figures, is the cost ofthe armed forces. In my predecessor&apos;s figures that cost was provisionally put,at any rate in the early period, at  500 million per annum.  500 million ayear looks very large compared with pre-war figures, but it is not an excessivefigure on the assumptions in PR. (43) 8 and those assumptions look reasonableas a working basis on an item which is necessarily conjectural at this stage.I am sure, however, that the country will not tolerate the taking of risks on international security. I am equally sure that we cannot wait for a reasonablereduction of taxation until it becomes possible to reduce the cost of the armed forces.. IV. Future Considerations.12. The difficulties of the budgetary problem during the early post-war years are thus likely to be great; and they are rendered more formidable by thefact that we cannot expect them to be lightened by the mere passage of years,as has happened after previous wars. On the one hand, the total cost of theSocial Insurance Plan will increase from  673 million in 1945 to  854 million in 1975, and the additional charge on the taxpayers will rise from  78 million in 1945 to  283 million in 1975. On the other hand, we must expect that thebuoyancy of the revenue resulting from the increase in the aggregate national income will be less in future that it has been in the past.13. During the past two and a half centuries Great Britain has emerged from each of her major wars with an annual debt charge which was extremelyhigh in relation to the financial resources of the time. This usually gave riseto a budget problem of considerable difficulty, the debt service accounting forthe greater part of the national expenditure as late as a hundred years ago.But in the course of time the debt burden was made less onerous partly by debtrepayment and conversion, and partly by virtue of the fact that year by yeartaxes at a given rate yielded an increasing sum of money. It was mainly owingto the last fact that the huge burden of debt left behind by the Napoleonic Warshad become quite easy to carry by the end of the nineteenth century, and thatthere was no serious financial difficulty in the present century in opening thechapter of large-scale social expenditure.14. This buoyancy of the revenue was attributable to a combination of two factors : viz. (1) the increase in the average income level of the population, resultingfrom technical and economic progress, and (2) the rapid increase in the number ofthe working population. We may fairly hope that the first of these influences willcontinue to operate, perhaps with an increased momentum. But we cannot look for any further assistance from the second. The trend of our vital statisticssuggests that the population of working age will soon cease to grow and maysubsequently decline.15. This is likely to diminish materially the future buoyancy of the revenue.With a stationary or declining population, it is not reasonable to expect that thetotal national income can continue to expand at a rate at all comparable with that,for example, between 1800 and 1940, when the population of Great Britain rose from about 10 million to 46 million, i.e., by more than four and a half times.16.   The burden of the debt resulting from the war of 1914-18 was materiallyTightened by conversion operations, which-were the main influence in reducing theannual interest charge from  332 million in 1921-22 to  217 million in 1938-39.We have no reasonable expectation of obtaining any similar relief after the present war, having succeeded during its course in borrowing at low interest rates.
i 017. In these circumstances the automatic increases of expenditure under theSocial Insurance Plan, mainly for retirement pensions, represent a very seriouscommitment. This, it should be observed, is by no means the only heading underwhich expenditure is likely to grow more or less automatically. Housing subsidies,for example, must be expected to grow steadily, as additional houses are built, withthe aid of an Exchequer contribution spread over forty years. We may yet cometo find that the remaining buoyancy of the revenue has been fully mortgaged inadvance for various long-term commitments. Meanwhile any serious reductionin the cost of the Armed Forces is a matter for hope rather than for confidence.18. It is important to appreciate the long-term financial problem in its trueC perspective, since otherwise sub-conscious beliefs, based on a past experience thatis no longer relevant, may create a misleading impression that time is bound to relieve our financial difficulties. It is especially important to scrutinise very carefully all proposed commitments that are likely to entail automatic increases ofexpenditure.V. Conclusion.19. We are, I think, compelled to look at our existing and prospectivecommitments from the point of view of priorities. Among them there are a numberwhose date of starting and rate of growth may not be as early and as fast as I have assumed. There are others which are of relatively short duration, though for thereally transitory items at the end of the war I have assumed that we shall borrow.With a wider spread, the total may be somewhat reduced.20. Some mitigation of our difficulties could be secured by a slowing down of the tempo on post-war services, but I doubt whether it will be of significantamount unless we can turn some of the larger items into definite programmes withstages each to be undertaken only as resources are available. In this connection,my colleagues will realise that Parliamentary pressure in recent months hasinvariably been for more and not less speed.21. The figures in this paper are necessarily conjectural. The national income, the yield of taxation from it and the prospective expenditure all havemany uncertainties. By and large, however, the picture is, I believe, a fairone. It is the best I can draw. It is for my colleagues as a whole to decide what course we are to adopt. As it presents itself to me, the issue is whether we take risks on the possibility of reducing^taxation or whether we seek postpone-ment of some parts of our schemes.J.
