(44) 359.3(M June, 1944.WAR CABINET,FLYING BOMBS : REFERENCES TO THE LONDON AREA.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.THE War .Cabinet at its meeting on the 13th June (W.M. (44) 77thConclusions) approved the proposal that information published about enemy air raids, whether by flying bombs or otherwise, south of a line from the Wash to the bristol Channel, should give no indication where the air raid had taken placebeyond saying that it occurred in Southern England. The purpose of this restriction was to prevent the enemy knowing whether his missiles had fallen inLondon or the proportion of them which had fallen in London.Since this decision the ban on the sending of diplomatic communications bycipher and on the movement of foreign diplomats out of the country has been removed and it seems a safe assumption that information has by now reached theenemy at least that a material proportion of his missiles have hit London.Whether any accurate information about the extent of damage in London, or theproportion of missiles which have reached London as compared with those fallingin the country, has reached the enemy through neutral diplomatic sources may bemore doubtful, since it wTould be difficult for a neutral diplomat to get a reallyaccurate picture without a good deal of enquiry and research.There are other sources than diplomatic sources through which the enemymay receive information about the progress of his attack. If and when travel to Ireland and ordinary telephone communication with Ireland are restored, thefact that casualties and damage have been caused in London is bound to become a matter of common knowledge in Ireland fairly soon, though it may take sometim,&apos;e for information through this channel to reach the enemy. Moreover, underthe arrangements recently negotiated with the German Government, a party ofsome 500 German civilian prisoners of war in this country is due to be sent toGermany in exchange for the same number of British prisoners of w^ar, towardsthe end of next month; these German prisoners of war are receiving visits fromtheir friends in this country and are no doubt fairly well informed of the nature and effects of the enemy&apos;s attack by flying bombs on London. The Ministry ofHealth are anxious to arrange, now that overseas travel is reopened, for the return of a substantial number of the Gibraltarian refugees how in London who help to fill up the tube shelters and constitute a rather unsatisfactory element of theLondon population in present conditions, and if they go these people also will carry news to Gibraltar of the attack on London.Moreover and this is a point which was stressed at a recent conference whichthe Minister of Information and I had with Editors publicity given to the factthat Lpndon is the target of the enemy.&apos;s attacks has in the past proved of con-siderable value towards the maintenance of the morale of Londoners and thelimitation of references to location to. &quot; Southern England &quot; means that so far aspublicity is concerned London is not in the centre of the picture. The toll of death,injury and damage to property from these attacks on London is far heavier than isgenerally appreciated. Though the proportion of persons killed to other casualties[27745-2]
is less than in the raids of 1940-41, the total casualties in London for a month of lying bomb attack would, if the present rate of casualties continues, be equalto those of September 1940, the worst month of the blitz period. InSeptember 1940, 5,546 persons were killed and 7,167 seriously injured in theLondon Region. In 14 days and nights of attack by flying bombs up to the morning of the 29th June, 1,679 persons have been killed and about 5,000seriously injured in the London Region. In this period a total of nearly 270,000houses in London have been damaged, of which over 7,000 have been destroyed.The figures for the various categories of damage are not yet available, and nodoubt some of the damage has been superficial, but the total figure is 23 percent, of the number of houses damaged in London (including those lightlydamaged) during the whole period from September 1940 to May 1941. If damagecontinues at the present rate for two months, as many London houses will have suffered damage in that period as the accumulated total for the nine months ofthe Blitz. The attacks, though intermittent, go on day and night, and the strainupon the people of London is severe. They have borne and are bearing itadmirably, but it would be of the greatest help to the maintenance of their moralein what may be a prolonged ordeal if Ministers, persons in authority, and thePress were able to address their words of encouragement and admiration to thepeople of London instead of to the population of Southern England. We mustnot forget, however, to pay tribute to the people of the towns and villages ofSouthern England who have had their share of trials and troubles, but we shouldbe able to give to Londoners what is their due and let them and the country know that we are proud of them, whilst paying tribute to the other areas : a sense of balance is necessary.All &quot;these considerations point to a modification of the existing ban on reference to London, but there are other considerations which suggest that it isnecessary to go cautiously. It is clear that it is impossible now to conceal fromthe enemy the fact that some of his missiles have reached London, but it is stillimportant to deny as far as possible knowledge of the proportion which havefallen in London, information as to the extent of damage and any information which would be of assistance to him in directing his attack. His methods andtactics may still be fluid and we must take care not to provide him with any information which would help bim to secure better results. If the Press were allowed to report flying-bomb attacks on London it is certain that even withinthe existing rules, which require submission to censorship of reports of damage, &amp;c, information would be given to the enemy which would be useful tohim merely as a result of the way in which the news was presented. After a specially heavy raid more prominence would be given in the Press to accounts ofthe raid than after a light attack. Even if a system of rationing of the spacewhich newspapers could devote to., reports of these attacks were adopted,differences of treatment on different occasions would still result, and from these differences the enemy might well be able to make useful deductions. If, forinstance, a light attack resulted from deflection of his missiles owing to a gale,or if by reason of an experimental change in the weight of explosive or some othertechnical feature of his attack only a few of a large number of missiles despatchedon a particular night found their target in London, the next morning&apos;s paperswould tell the enemy what he wanted to know simply by their presentation of the news about the raid. We must also keep in mind that there is a possibility of attack by another weapon, and that, though steps have been taken so far aspossible to prevent publication of information in the Press should such an attackbe launched, information may be published before there is time to stop it. Thiswould not matter much if the location of an incident were given as &quot; southern england,&quot; but reference to an incident in London would convey to the enemy atonce that his missile had found its target.I have considered whether it would be possible to devise some means ofdisclosing the fact that London has been the target of the enemy attacks and thatLondoners have borne their share of the resulting casualties and. damage without,at the same time conveying useful information to the enemy. I suggest that this could be done by continuing for the future so far as concerns day-to-day reportsof the present form of enemy attack, the restriction limiting reference to locationto &quot; Southern England,&quot; while allowing some reference to the attacks on Londonwhich have taken place up to the present date. The limits within which Pressreferences to these attacks and to the part which London has played could beallowed would have to be carefully considered, and I would suggest that instruc-tions to the Press should, be worked out in consultation between the Ministry
of Home Security, the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Information. the broad lines of these instructions might be as follows : (1) No references must be made which would give any indication of theproportion of missiles or incidents as between London and the rest ofSouthern England.(2) No references must be made which would give any indication of the extentof damage in the London area.(3) Where incidents, hitherto described as in Southern England, are nowreferred to as having occurred in London, the date of the incidentmust not be given either overtly or by implication.(4) The existing censorship rules requiring submission to censorship of allstories of damage will still apply.(5) The permission of reference i to London will only extend up to a specifiedelate (which may be extended from time to time), and the &quot; southern england &apos;&apos; rule will apply in respect of all reports after that date and until a further date is authorised.H.
