/THIS DOCUMENT IS TUB PROPERTY OF HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY 3 GOVERNMENTSECRET Cony No.  S h-y.P. (44)  578 2055th July.  1944WAR    CABINETPLYING    BOMBS - PUBLIC WARNING -Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour and NationalService1. Following the earlier discussion on this subject, I have been taking soundings as to the necessity of warnings to members of thegeneral public and representatives of industry.2.      I agree with the Home Secretary that a general warning by thesiren is necessary, but I feel very strongly that, in addition,some warning of imminent danger should be given generally in theLondon Region.      fchst I would propose is that the guns should befired, blank rounds should suffice,  in the areas on the linealong which the bomb will pass.      If this could be done people would be enabled to take cover and would have greater confidence in going about their business.3.      I understand that in those works and offices where there arearrangements for giving notice of imminent danger either from a central alarm system or by means of spotters, people take coverwhen necessary and with the minimum of disturbance to their work.The essential thing is that they should have confidence and Ibelieve that this would be given generally to the people in the streets as well as those at work by the arrangements I have suggested.4.     At the same time I should like to suggest a wide extension ofthe present bell system into offices and business premises generally.I do not see that there need be any great difficulty about this and I am sure that the results would be well worth while.5.     In my view, anything we can do to give the greatest possible number of people the feeling that they can carry on with theknowledge that they will get a reasonable warning.of imminent danger will do much to ensure that the flying bombs create theminimum of disturbance and that casualties are kept low.SthJuly, 1944.
