&apos; 0jT-  201(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(Ui4-)  377 .       COPY NO.___-5TH JULY. 19U-U--WAR CABINETPLYING BOMBSPUBLIC    WARNING    &quot;Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security1* The War Cabinet at their meeting on the 3rd July(W.M,(144-) 85th Conclusions) invited me to consider what modifications could be made in the warning system, bothin London and in the areas outside London affected by flying bomb attacks, with a view to reducing to a minimum the interference with work while at the same timepreventing avoidable casualties*2* After very careful consideration and in the lightof much accumulated knowledge of the changing reactions ofthe public to the warning system during the earlier phasesof enemy air raiding the Civil Defence Committee decidedthat public warnings for. the flying bomb, when it material-ised, should be given by means of the siren in the same wcy as for ordinary aircraft, unless and until experience of the newweapon showed this decision to be wrong.     During the part fortnight attacks by flying &quot;bombs have been fairly continuousand in consequence, the siren has frequently sounded the&quot;Alert&quot; and the &quot;Raiders Passed&quot;,  especially in the greater london area.      Such criticism, of the arrangements as therehas been appears to be due not to their efficiency but onaccount of the number and length of the warnings and, to a .lesser extent, to a belief that the public at large disregard the warnings or do not know what to do when they hear them.3.     &apos;        The existing arrangements are as follows:-(l) Greater London area.(a) By day.     A warning is given, except that normally anisolated flying bomb is ignored.      An attempt ismade to give a Raiders Passed (All Clear) signalas soon as it can reasonably be done, e.g, when nofurther flying bombs are on the way.(b) By night.    - When a warning is given at or near duskthe &quot;Raiders Passed&quot; is not normally given until an opportunity occurs after about 6 a.m. next day,,in order to avoid disturbing people who have gone to sleep,(2) The rest of South East England outside the greater london area.Warnings are not normally given for flying bombspassing over as it is well understood that london is the target.

tk. Some of the criticism directed against the present arrangements is due to a misunderstanding of their purpose,The. public warning by siren is an &quot;alert&quot; and not an &quot;alarm&quot;as the Prime Minister made clear to the public and to theworkers in the summer of 1940.      It is intended to tell thepublic and the civil defence services to be on the look out for attack and to be ready to take action.      It is not,however, intended to be a signal to stop essential work andin fact the public h ive for the most part now taken theadvice given them in I9I4.O to continue with their jobs.,Shops and offices do not shut, and workers in factories^usually work until they receive a special local imminent danger warning on Royal Observer Corps information or from raidspotters.      This &quot;imminent danger&quot;    industrial warning has long commanded the confidence    of the workers 5    it has savedmany millions of man-hours;    and the officers of mydepartment concerned, as well as those of the royal observer Corps and the General Post Office deserve highcredit for its efficiency.       The interference with production is not therefore great where these local warnings are obeyedbut for the public at large the intimation that danger isapproaching puts them on guard,  so that they may take immediate cover for a short time if they hear a flying bomboverhead.      In addition, there are some people, e,gochildren in schools, for whom the siren warning is the onlyavailable signal to take cover,,      It is also the signalto call out the Civil Defence Services and to closewatertight gates of the LnP,T.B,  tunnels under the river,,5* It has been suggested that the use of the sirenfor flying bomb raid should be discontinued and no warningat all be given for the general public.      In favour of thiscourse it is said the sirens make tho popfilace wnervy&quot; and thatthey sound so frequently that no one knows what is the stateof the warningo     This last contention is true and especiallywas this noticeable during the cloudy and rainy period from30th June to 3rd July when interception was difficult and ag greater proportion of flying bombs was able to reach the target area in London,      But the weather conditions werealtogether abnormal.6. Another argument for abolishing the siren is  (it is &apos;said) that when it is sounded people take no notice of ito.To some extent this is true, but those of a more nervous ,disposition undoubtedly do take heed of the warning,particularly if they have no essential work on hand, andreassure themselves by staying indoors instead of infectingtheir fellow citizens with their own nervousness0      This is all to the good.      It is increasingly unlikely that those with specific tasks of importance to perform will be deterredmerely by reason of the sounding of the siren,7* On the other hand, my firm belief is that the public in general, not to mention old people and those in charge ofchildren do wish to know which are the danger periods so thatat their own discretion they can adjust their actionsaccordingly and take no unnecessary risks0      It must have been some comfort for the public at large to know (which theywould not have done if the existing arrangements had beensorapped) that on Sunday 2nd July there were periods amountingto Ik hours in daylight during which they were under no risk of attack and could relax with a good conscience,8c A further argument (which has been impressed upon mo very recently by representatives of both sides of industry and theSupply Departments) is that the Workpeople in workshops and

*? n Qfactories are very- concerned that their v/ives and.families should receive warning of attack.      They them-selves often work on until the factory warning ofimminent danger is received hut in some cases in thepast :..where the alert has not been given to the publicthere has &quot;been great dissatisfaction at this preferential treatment of particular establishments or sections ofthe community, and even threats of strikese9o I feel that the great advantage of the presentsystem of public warning is the generally reliableknowledge that when the &quot;Raiders Passed&quot; has sounded thereis no longer danger.,      If sirens were not sounded at allspeople would be   m the qui vive for 2h hours with thepresent type of raiding and would never know when theycould relax.      This would lead to increased tension whichwould affect morale and also add to the strain on theCivil Defence workers, who would have to stand bycontinuously,,10. I therefore consider that a public warning isstill necessary for flying bombs and piloted aircraftalike and that the siren is the most satisfactory way to provide itc11 * I attach as an appendix cop:.3s of four letterswhich appeared in the press this morning0Ha MoHome Office and Ministry of Home Security,Whitehall, SoWdo,5th July, 19hA-appendix the question Mr.. A, Denville. the Tory M,PUfor Newcastle C.s  is to ask Mr, Morrison contains asuggestion of superlative stupidity - to discontinue theuse of air-raid sirenssHas he given a minute of thought to the implicationsespecially where children must be safeguarded?Alternatively, to shorte??. tc one;-third would mean that a large number of people would not hear them,  in. busy or noisy places.Leave them alone;      they are well arranged and well operated.    W0 G-uthrie Wilder,,Mr. Denville speaks for himself.We at least get the first warning of danger, which enables mothers with young children and babies to take them to safetyj, before the bomb approaches,  -- XcYoZ0I am a&apos;very busy housekeepers with duties whichmust be. performed, and without the alert signal shouldhave no knowledge that danger might be near,- A,EaMarkwald.Please spare us our &quot;Alerts&quot; and &quot;All Clears&quot; as atpresent. . .   .To the &quot;tough&quot; folk they may seem a nuisance, butperhaps these strong ones will bear with;them for the sake of their weaker brethernuTo us nervous ones, even a short &quot;All Clear&quot; comesas a blessed relief from the tension of listening   whilecooking, to know when to turn the gas.off, etc, -Mrs. B,Mo Hudspeth.
