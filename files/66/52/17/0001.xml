THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET. Copy..No. &amp;W.P. (44) 367.3rd July, 1944.WAR CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND for four WEEKS ENDING 18th JUNE, 1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.x.A. A detailed summary of operations is at Appendix A.B. Results of Operations.The great bulk of the operations carried out during this period were designedto assist either directly or indirectly the establishment and maintenance of our forces ashore in Normandy and the reduction and hampering of the enemy forcesopposed to them.1. Gun Positions and Coastal Batteries in France.Bomber Command took a highly successful part in the attack of gun positions and coastal batteries in France during the period. Very good results were obtained on Beaumont, Trouville, Eu, Le Clipon, Neufchatel and St. Valery-en Cans (see Print No. 1). On the eve of D-day attacks were carried out by1,136 aircraft on 10 coastal batteries to such good effect that, with the soleexception of the battery at Maisy, not a single battery was able to offer any seriousresistance to our invading forces. The battery at St. Martin ,de Varreville,which had already been heavily damaged on the 28th/29th May (see Print No. 2),was devastated in this attack. A document captured from the enemy states &apos;&apos; theposition has been hit with uncanny accuracy.&quot; Troops of the 6th AirborneDivision reported that they found the battery at Merville totally destroyed andthe garrison too dazed to resist.2. Wireless Stations in France.The Mont Couple radar jamming station and the Au Fevre W/T station were successfully attacked on the 31st May/1st June and were both rendered unservicable. Prints Nos. 3 and 4 show the virtual destruction of the wireless stations at Berneval le Grand and Ferme d&apos;Urvilie, which were attacked on thefollowing nights.3. Railway Centres.Among the many railway centres damaged before and after D-day wereTours, Angers, Nantes and Aachen (see Prints Nos. 7 to 10). The marshalling yards and the railway junction at Orleans suffered particularly badly (see PrintsNos. 11 and 12). The railway junction at Saumur was devastated (see Printa No. 13) and the railway tunnel in the same town, through which the main line from the west coast of France to Paris passed, was severely damaged (see print. 14). Print No. 15 shows the heavy damage at Poitiers, where 180 wagonswere destroyed or derailed and all the lines in the station and loop-sidings cut.At Versailles Matelot severe -damage was caused (see Print No. 16), and the marshalling yards at Alencon, Evretix, Valenciennes and Lens were successfully attacked.4, Communication and other Military Targets in France.Several attacks were made on road and rail junctions to interfere with theenemy&apos;s communication lines both before and after D-day.   An outstandingsuccess was achieved at the St. Lo main road junction, where&apos;the whole area[27760] *
was completely pulverised. Both bridges at Caen were very severely damaged1 and all the approaches to the bridge crossing the railway at Massy Palaiseau were hit (see Print No. 5). The railway bridge crossing the river Soulle at Coutanceswas hit (see Print No. 6). and among other similar targets damaged wereobjectives at Argentan, Vire and Lisieux. The military camp at Bourg Leopoldwas very accurately hit on the night of the 27th/28th May and 150 personnel hutswere destroyed or severely damaged. M/T and troop concentrations at Evrecyand Aunay-sur-Odon were heavily bombed; airfields at Le Mans, Rennes andFlers were successfully attacked.5. French Ports.After the landing attacks were made in daylight and at dusk on the ports of Le Havre and Boulogne and photographs show these to have been&apos; highly successful. In addition to heavy destruction to port facilities and (at Le Havre)the penetration of the E-boat shelters, a large number of vessels in both ports were sunk or damaged.6. Targets in Germany.Attacks were made on Duisburg. Dortmund and Brunswick, and Mosquitoattacks were carried out on Berlin, Cologne. Ludwigshaven, Hanover and Lever-kusen.  Print No. 17 shows further extensive damage in Dortmund.By far the most important and successful attacks upon targets in germany during the period were the precision attacks made on the synthetic oil plants atSterkrade (Hotten) and Gelsenkirchen (Nordstern) in the Ruhr. Print No. 18shows that appreciable damage was clone to the Sterkrade plant in spite of thefact that this was a blind bombing attack made in conditions of 10/10 ths cloud.Print No. 19 shows that very severe damage, which will immobilise the plant forsome time, was done at the Nordstern, which is the largest plant in the Ruhr.C. Sea Mining&apos;.Tactical minelaying was carried out before D-day in the English channel and off the Dutch and Belgian coasts.. Since then minelaying has been plannedwith the intention of obstructing the activities of U-boats and enemy lightsttrface-craft against the eastern and western flanks of our Channel communica-tions to the Armies in Normandy. We appear to have been particularly successful in the Brest area, and a report states that skilled artisans are being &quot;transferredto this base to cope with repairs to shipping damaged recently by our mines. Theminelaying in the Kiel Canal during the night of the 12th/13th May appears tohave had a very considerable effect upon traffic using this waterway. photographic reconnaissance showed that as late as the 24th May over 63 ships&apos;were held up offHoltenau and a further 16 off Brunsbuttel; other merchant ships were observedat anchor in Kiel Fjord.Details of mine-laying successes are set out in Appendix B.A. H.
