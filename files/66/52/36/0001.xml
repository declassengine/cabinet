Re-Allocation of Man Power during&apos; -------Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service at the meeting of the Cabinet on 21st March, 1944, (W.M-. (44)37th Conclusions) reference was made to the draft White Paper onthe Scheme for Re-allocation of Man Power after the. End ofHostilities in Europe and note was taken that it was undesirable to lay the White Paper at that time.I think the time has come- when the scheme should be announced.If I am to be ready at an early date with schemes for there-allocation &quot;of civilian labour following the German armistice andfor the controls and machinery that will be necessary to carry outboth the military and the civilian re-allocation, I must get thesesohemes worked out with both sides of industry as soon as possible.At the moment, I am held up and am unable to have any consultations with the organisations concerned on these matters.   I am very anxious to start these consultations not later than the beginningof August and I would press, therefore, for the publication ofthe Re-allocation Scheme before the Recess.It will of course be necessary to decide on the method of publication. * i10th July, 1944 B.B.
