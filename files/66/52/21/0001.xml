THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1944.SECRET. Copy No. o bW.P. (44) 371.3rd Julv. 1944.t/ *WAR CABINET.INDIA.GANDHI:   PLACE OE DETENTION IF RE-ARRESTED.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.IN my memorandum of the 5th May (W.P. (44) 241) I said that in view of gandhi&apos;s release there was no need for further consideration of rny proposal ofthe 2nd May (W.P. (44) 236) that he should be transferred from the Aga Khan&apos;sPalace at Poona to Ahmednagar Fort, where the members of the CongressWorking Committee are detained. The Government of India, however, in atelegram of the 29th June which I circulate herewith, have expressed their wishto have plans ready in the event of it becoming necessary to arrest Gandhi again though they do not regard this as an imminent possibility and propose thatif need were to arise he should be interned in company with members of theCongress Working Committee in Ahmednagar. They refer to the climaticsuitability of Ahmednagar and mention the superior facilities it affords as a placeof internment for ensuring complete segregation from the public.In commending the proposal to the favourable consideration of the WarCabinet I need only add to what I said in my memorandum of the 2nd May that ghandi&apos;s detention in Ahmednagar along with the Congress leaders would beless likely to attract embarrassing speculations if effected after his rearrest thanit might have clone had he been transferred thither from Poona before his release.L. S. A.India Office, 3rd July, 1944.Cypher Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary ofState for India, dated&apos;New Delhi, 29th June, 1944.(8589.   Important.)Though, there is no indication at present that it will be necessary to re-arrestGandhi we must settle where to send him if necessity arises. Aga Khan&apos;s palaceno longer available. Ahmednagar Fort is healthy and most suitable place for him as for Members of Working Committee, since segregation from other prisoners and outside world can there be ensured. At Ahmednagar he would have thecompany of members of Working Committee, but we see no disadvantage in thatin the circumstances likely to be present if his arrest becomes necessary.[27757]
