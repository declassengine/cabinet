(144)389) of the 12th July I circulated a note on the above subject prepared by the Research andExperiments Department of the Ministry of Home Security.      Ithas now been necessary to revise the figures relating to the flying bomb attacks in view of a revised estimate by the AirStaff of the amount of explosive in the flying bomb.       Thefigure now given is 850 kilos, as compared with the originalfigure of 1060 kilos. The original note was based on a provisional estimate arrived at in the light of the informationthen available.I am accordingly circulating the attached Research a,ndExperiments Department memorandum giving the revised figures.I should, perhaps, point out that the blast effect in the caseof flying bombs is greater on the average, ton for ton, thanthat of the mixed load carried by aircraft.Copy No.1 O 0H.M.Home Office and Ministry of Home Security,Whitehall, S.W.1.19th July, I9A44.
