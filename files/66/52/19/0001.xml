S.101&quot;MINISTRY OF HOME SECURITY-RESEARCH AND  EXPERIMENTS  DEPARTMENT171Copy No*tt * * *SUMMARY OF INFORMATION ON THE &apos;FLYING BOMB&apos;The following additional information has been received since the circulation of the first Summary up to 24/6/44 .DAMAGgJIFFECTjSFinal reports on the house- damage incidents resulting from groundlevel bursts indicate that the radii of damage should be as follows.Average circ A	le radii of house c B	lamage (fto) C61	104	169The variation recorded between different bombs is about i 15%;    this is &quot;thenormal figure which holds good for all weapons, and there is-no suggestionthat more than one bomb size or more than one type of filling is being used.FIRE FOLLOWING- EXPLOSION OF FLYA study of the proportion of FLY incidents in which fires have occurred has indicated that FLY is about as effective as an ordinary H.E. bombof similar size in causing fires.     The suggestion made early, that more fires were being caused per bomb in the later attacks than in the earlier ones, has proved to be without foundation0DISTRIBUTION AND DENSITY OF FLYCroydon still leads the boroughs in the number of missilesreceived. 3 7 being reported during the period 23.00 June 15th to 23.00June 27th.     Lewisham received 33 during this period and Wandsworth 28.The highest concentration in terms of number of missiles perkilometre square received during the period stated was achieved in the borough of Southwark where 4 bombs are reported pgr one kilometre square and 3 ineach of 2 other kilometre squares.     Figures for day and night concentrationsseparately are not available 0&apos;A table bringing the distribution of FLY in different regions up todate is given overleafo      Figures previously issued have now been correctedsand the table may be considered as accurate up to June 24th.
