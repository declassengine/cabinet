NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Continuous minelaying by enemy aircraft at night has restrictedshipping movements and has inflicted casualties on Allied ships and landing craftin the assault area in Normandy.Cherbourg has been heavily bombarded by Allied warships, and coastal forces have attacked enemy shipping which was attempting to escape from the port.Allied submarines have successfully attacked enemy shipping in theMediterranean.A large force of U.S. carrier-borne aircraft has inflicted heavy casualties on japanese warships and aircraft in the Pacific. H.M. carrier-borne aircraft haveattacked Port Blair in the Andaman Islands.Four U-boats have been sunk, three probably sunk and six possibly sunk.Home Waters.2. The north-easterly gale which persisted till the 21st did very considerable damage, not only to ships in the assault areas but also to the artificial breakwaters,quays and piers which were in process of completion at the time. In many casesthese were rendered wholly or partially unusable. In the western sector coasterswere beached for unloading in order to meet urgent requirements for ammunition.By the 24th, the general situation had much improved and during the 24 hours to p.m. on that day discharges in the British sector alone totalled 25,000 men,3,365 vehicles and 19,250 tons of stores. Discharge of bulk petrol has begun at port-en-Bessin, where on the 25th, 6,000 tons were discharged. On the 28th, astrong south-westerly wind prevented the sailing of landing craft convoys andhindered unloading on the beaches. The following are the cumulative totalsunloaded in both the British and U.S. sectors up to p.m. on the 26th : 769,700 men,126,427 vehicles; 358,177 tons of stores.3. On the 25th, Cherbourg was bombarded by a force of H.M. and U.S.heavy warships. Minesweepers cleared a channel for the bombarding forces andcover was provided by H.M and U.S. destroyers. The German batteries repliedat first with heavy and accurate fire in the course of which the U.S. battleshipTexas, H.M. cruiser Glasgow and three U.S. destroyers were hit and damaged.All the German batteries except one were finally put out of action and silenced.On the 24th, two U.S. destroyers engaged enemy batteries to the east of Cherbourgwhich were firing at Allied minesweepers, and on the following day cruisers and destroyers shelled enemy guns which were bombarding the eastern flank near Caen.4. Enemy ships attempting to escape from Cherbourg have been attacked by our light forces. Early on the 23rd, an escorted convoy was intercepted southof Jersey by four M.T.Bs. One armed trawler was sunk, one ship of the convoy was left on fire and damage was inflicted on the remainder by gunfire. On thefollowing morning a convoy of seven ships and some small craft, which had leftCherbourg westbound, was attacked by M.T.Bs.; one ship was seen to sink andthree others are believed to have sunk. An enemy coaster was also sunk by anotherforce of M.T.Bs. On the night of the 25th/26th, three E-boats escaped fromCherbourg under cover of smoke and although engaged by H.M. ships are believed to have entered Havre. Early on the 27th, M.T.Bs., operating south-west ofJersey, attacked and damaged a force of trawlers and minesweepers and latertorpedoed and probably sank a minesweeper. An enemy landing craft was alsodamaged off Cap d&apos;Antifer. On the following morning H.M.C.S. Huron and h.M.S. Eskimo (destroyers) sank two enemy trawlers and damaged a third north-west of St. Malo. Eskimo sustained slight damage and a few casualties. E-boats,attempting to raid the eastern assault area on the night of the 25th/26th, were driven off by H.M. destroyer Stevenstone, who claims to fiave damaged one of them.5. Casualties to ships, apart from those reported in Appendix V, are asfollows : H.M. cruiser Scylla and the Norwegian destroyer Glaisdale were minedon the 23rd, but reached a U.K. port. H.M. destroyer Swift was mined and sunk on the 24th and H.M.S. Bachaquero (L.S.T.) was mined on the same daybut reached port. H.M. cruiser Arethusa was slightly damaged by a mine onthe 25th. H.M.S. Largs (H.Q. ship) was mined and slightly damaged on the night of the 24th/25th; on the 28th, she was hit by gunfire without causingserious damage or casualties. On the night of the 24th/25th H.M.S. Nith (HQ.ship) was hit by a bomb.  On the 25th, H.M.S. Goodson (frigate) was torpedoed
96dby a U-boat off Start Point and was taken in tow. Two M.T. ships have been mined and sunk in the assault area. H.M.S. Pink (corvette) was damaged byan underwater explosion on the 27th, north-east of Barfleur, but reached port.The Maid of Orleans (L.S.I.) was sunk in the same area on the 28th.6. No full report on the present condition of Cherbourg harbour has beenreceived. A clearance party began work on the 27th. In addition to the damagereported last week, the entrance channel to the outer harbour has been blockedby small sunken vessels and a ship has been sunk to block the entrance to theBassin Napoleon III. The east quay of the outer harbour has been demolishedas have all the quays of the Darse Transatlantique. Mines have been detonatedat nine points on the Digue Hornet and the seaplane hangars have been demolished.7. On the 25th, three M.T.Bs. attacked four armed trawlers off the mouth of the Scheldt and damaged two of them. On the night of the 26th/27th,M.T.Bs. sank two trawlers in the same area.Mediterranean.8. On the night of the 20th/21st, U.S. coastal forces torpedoed a corvetteand a small transport in the Gulf of Spezia. On the following night theyattacked a coaster and two F-lighters in the Gulf of Genoa and torpedoed oneof them. On the 20th, 6,065 tons of cargo were landed at Civita Vecchia. Onthe 21st. H.M. S/M Universal sank an A/S vessel off the south coast of Franceand on the following day sank a 12,000-ton and a 6,000-ton liner in the harbour at Cassis. On the 27th, H.M. S/M Ultor sank a 7,000-ton tanker and a 3,000-ton ship off Nice. On the 21st, the French S/M Curie bombarded shore batteries that were under construction near Port Vendres. Fourteen hits were obtained andthree large explosions were seen.9. In the Adriatic, on the night of the 24th/25th, coastal forces drove a torpedo-boat ashore on Murter Island (Albanian coast). Five prisoners were taken.10. On the 21st, H.M. S/M Unsparing sank a convoy consisting of anA/S ship, a motor lighter and a Siebel ferry off the south coast of Greece.H.M. S/M Sickle is overdue from patrol in the iEgean and must be consideredlost.East Indies.11. On the 18th, H.M. S/M Storm sank a 1,500-ton ship in convoy north ofPenang.12. On the 21st, 15 Barracudas, escorted by 16 Corsairs, from H.M.S.Illustrious attacked Port Blair (Andaman Islands). The Augusta radar station was destroyed and the Harriet radar atation and tower were damaged. Hits,were obtained on barracks, powerhouse, sawmills and workshops. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.   One Barracuda is missing.Pacific.13. For the first time since the autumn of 1942, the Japanese Fleet hasventured within flying range of the U.S. Fleet, to the east of the Philippines.On the 16th, the U.S. Fleet appears to have divided into two groups, oneof which was covering the landing operations at Saipan, and the otherimmobilising the airfields in the Bonin Islands. By the 18th it was reported that nearly 300 Japanese shore-based aircraft had been destroyed, and that only super-ficial damage from bombs and shell-fire had been suffered by U.S. warships. Onthe 19th, the Japanese launched a large-scale carrier-borne aircraft attack on theU.S. Fleet. Most of these aircraft attempted to land and re-fuel on air strips atGuam and Rota. In the ensuing action, one U.S. battleship and two U.S. aircraft carriers were slightly damaged and 21 U.S. aircraft were lost. It is claimed that18 Japanese aircraft were destroyed by A/A fire and a further 335 by fighters.On the 20th, fleet carriers of theU-.S. Fleet closed the enemy, which wasthen between Luzon and the marinas, but owing to approaching nightfallonly one attack by aircraft could be made. In this action one enemy carrier, threetankers and a destroyer were sunk.  Two other carriers, a kong-c\a,ss battleship,
a cruiser and three destroyers were damaged. Between 15 and 20 Japanese aircraft were shot down. A further aircraft carrier may have been sunk by aU.S. submarine on the 18th. In all these operations 98 U.S. aircraft were lost.It was announced on the 24th that the Japanese losses in the Mariana campaignwere 44 ships sunk, two probably sunk and 47 ships damaged. U.S. casualties were five ships damaged.Anti-Submarine Operations.14. Forty-two attacks have been made during the week, of which 25 wereby shore-based aircraft, two by carrier-borne aircraft and 15 by warships. Alarge number of these attacks were carried out in the western entrance to theChannel.On the 24th, H.M.C.S. Haida and H.M.S. Eskimo (destroyers) sank a U-boat off Ushant, from which survivors were picked up. On the same day a CanadianCatalina sank one north-east of the Shetlands. The aircraft was shot downbut the crew were rescued. On the 25th, H.M.S. Bickerton (frigate) sank oneoff Start Point and picked up survivors., On the following day a Liberator sank one N. W. of Bergen. H.M.*S/M. Satyr probably sank a U-boat off Lofoten Islandson the 15th, Aircraft from U.S.S. Bogue (escort carrier) probably sank one west of the Cape Verde Islands on the 24th; this, to judge from some of the debrisrecovered, was probably a Japanese U-boat, bound for Europe with raw materials.On the 26th, one was probably sunk by H.M.S. Bulldog (destroyer) off the westcoast of Ireland (R). Six other U-boats were possibly sunk; four by aircraft andtwo by escort groups in the western approaches to the Channel.Enemy Intelligence.15. One Hipper class cruiser and possibly one of the pocket battleshipsmay have moved to a south Finnish port.It is - reported that the Tirpitz&apos; is preparing to move southwards fromAltenfjord in the near future.A number of transports have recently proceeded southwards from Norway;it is reported that four divisions have been evacuated and only nine divisions are left.U-boats.16. It is estimated that three or four U-boats are operating in the english channel.   Two or three others are between Ushant and the Lizard.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17.   No ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during the week.In the Channel operations, two ships were damaged by gunfire from coastalbatteries in the Strait of Dover. Two ships were sunk and one damaged bymines, and one ship was sunk and one damaged by gunfire in the assault area.U-boat operations in the Channel have so far met with no success and have provedcostly to the enemy. Three ships have been damaged by F/B. in the london docks.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 25th, 773 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 294 were in ocean convoys and479 in British coastal convoys.Three escort carriers, 36 destroyers (including 18 U.S. destroyers) and 84sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Five homebound convoys consisting of 153 ships and three outward-bound convoys of 141 ships reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying..19... No minelaying by surface craft was reported during the week.Aircraft have laid mines in the Kattegat, oft&apos; the north coast of France andthe Biscay ports.Mines have been laid in the Malacca Strait.
Enemy Mmelaymg, Allied Minesweeping.20. Minelaying by enemy aircraft at night persists in the assault area.The mining menace is reported to be serious and it has necessitated considerablerestrictions on shipping movements. In the eastern sector during the week34 ground mines have been destroyed and 20 others were self-detonated.Thirteen mines have been destroyed off the Eddystone.Enemy aircraft were suspected of minelaying off the East Coast on one night.The mine totals are 4,917 ground and 5,115 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping,21. Three of the larger ore-carrying ships which had been withdrawn havenow returned to this trade.  A number of the smaller ships Continue to operate.22. In the ^gean it was estimated that at the end of April there were about 400 caiques totalling 28,000 tons operating in this area. These have nowbeen augmented by about 21 small ships totalling 5,300 tons which have arrived from the Black Sea.MILITARY SITUATION.North-West France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.23. During this week operations have been mainly directed at clearing theCherbourg Peninsula and capturing the town. An offensive was also mountedand launched in the Tilly-sur-Seulles sector.Both operations have gone very well; Cherbourg was captured on the 27th,and the offensive in the Tilly-sur-Seulles area has started successfully.U.S. Sector.24. On the 22nd, the U.S. forces advanced rapidly towards Cherbourg,encountering strong resistance from various strong points on the way.The first substantial check was at Flottemanville Hague and Les Bertrands,close to the perimeter of the town of Cherbourg. At 1400 hours on the 22nd, U.S.troops launched an attack against the defences of the town after it had been bombed for 80 minutes and, as a result, slight advances were made. The attackscontinued supported by both air and naval bombardment until, on the 26th, allorganised resistance ceased in the town. The enemy continued to hold out on an airfield 7 miles east of Cherbourg and in the N.W. corner of the peninsula. Thestrongpoints in Cherbourg were finally liquidated on the 27th. The remainingareas held by the enemy are being gradually reduced.In the south of the peninsula there has been vigorous patrolling but nopositional changes.British Sector. ,25. There has been bitter and continuous fighting in the Tilly-sur-Seullesarea resulting in considerable losses to the enemy.As a result of armoured engagements which took place south of Tilly-sur-Seulles, the enemy was driven two miles south of the road running east and west through Tilly-sur-Seulles.On the 25th, a further attack was launched and the high ground S.E. of Tilly-sur-Seulles secured. Through this forward position a further attack was launched on the 26th, from the area of Norrey-en-Bessin south towards Grainville-sur-Odon. This advance is progressing favourably and our troops have nowcrossed the River Odon against strong tank and infantry resistance.East of the River Orne the enemy has continued to exert pressure and hasreacted strongly to any attempt to extend our bridgehead. After several days of hard fighting Chardonnerette was captured on the 23rd.Enemy artillery and mortar fire has prevented the full use of theOuistreham port facilities.French Resistance.26. The French Forces in the Interior have continued their widespreadsabotage of the enemy&apos;s road, rail and telephone communications, effectivelyhindering German military movements.
Guerilla fighting has occurred in several districts in Central and EasternFrance with casualties on both sides. The Germans are using considerable forces,and in Brittany the resistors have had to disperse but are now regrouping.Reports of severe reprisals and atrocities committed by the enemy against thecivil population are becoming more numerous.Substantial supplies of arms ha,ve been successfully delivered to the mamresistance areas, and reports show that the morale of the resistors has been considerably stimulated by this.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)27. During the past week, progress by* our forces in Italy has been steadyrather than spectacular, except on the Ligurian coast where the Allied line isnow only 25 miles south of Leghorn.On the Adriatic coast, bad weather has enabled the enemy to establisn some-thing of a defensive line along the River Chienti. All the bridges over this riverhave been demolished and though extensive patrolling has been carried out, no material advances bevond the river have been made.On the right of &quot;the Eighth Army sector, deep patrols have been made intothe mountains eastwards and contact made with the enemy at a number of points.In the flatter country, east and west of Lake Tarsimeno, the enemy had beenoffering stubborn resistance to our thrusts up the roads leading to Arezzo andFlorence. To the east of the Lake, little progress has been made but our forces are now approaching Magione.To the west of the Lake, Chiusi was finally cleared on the 26th, andadvances in this sector during the past week now amount to approximatelyfive miles.-In the mountains to the west of Chiusi advances have been made.Castiglione D&apos;Orcia was captured on the 22nd and our troops pushed on north-wards to S. Querico, which they captured on the 27th.Along the Ligurian seaboard U.S. troops have made considerable progressagainst resistance which appears to be less organised than in the centre of thecountry. Castiglione and Follonica were captured on the 24th. On the same day, patrols penetrated into Piombino to report the town cleared of the enemy.Suvereto and San Vincenzo were captured on the 26th, and our forward troops are now some eight miles south of Cecina.The Russian Campaign.  (Outline maps of Finland and West Russia are included as insets.)Finland.28. Since the capture of Viipuri on the 20th, the Russians have made some progress north of the town and have launched fresh attacks north of Lake Onegaand between Lakes Onega and Ladoga. In the latter sector they have cleared the whole line of the River Svir.The Russians report an advance of 22 miles on the 28th between LakesOnega and Ladoga and further progress S.W. of Viipuri along the Gulf off inland.Northern Sector.29. The Germans claim to have repulsed Russian attacks N.W. of Narva,near Pskov and S.E. of Ostrov. These attacks have not been mentioned by theRussians and may be no more than holding attacks.Central Sector.30. On the 22nd, the Russians launched attacks at a number of points ona wide front from north of Vitebsk to Mogilev. The offensive later spread tothe Zhlobm area, and heavy fighting is now in progress on the whole of theCentral Sector from the Pripet Marshes northwards.By the 26th, the Russians had captured Vitebsk, a stronghold which haddefied two strong earlier attempts. They claim also to have encircled and destroyed five German divisions in the Vitebsk area. In the last day or two the momentum of the Russian advance appears to have increased, and Russian forces have now occupied Orsha and, 50 miles to the west, have cut the railway Orsha-B^1l0I&quot; further south, fighting is now in progress in the outskirts of Bobruiskwhich has been isolated by the cutting of the main road and railway from Minsk&apos;
Advancing S.W. of Vitebsk on the 28th, the Russians occupied Lepel and towns 24 miles N.N.E. and eight miles N.E. of Borisov.Crossing the Dnieper on a 75 miles front on the 28th, the Russians capturedMogileV.  They have also made a further advance west of Bobruisk.General.It is clear that the new Russian offensive is on a large scale, and it has already achieved a considerable success. The fact that the Russians were able to announcean appreciable advance on the day after the offensive opened suggests that theGerman positions were penetrated more quickly than usual. It is not thoughtthat the Germans have any great weight of armour available for a counter-attack in the Central Sector.Yugoslavia.31. The Partisans have become increasingly active in Serbia; they haveattacked the town of Leskovac on the main line Belgrade-Salonika and have fought two Bulgarian columns S.W. of Nis.The Germans are exerting strong pressure on the Partisans in the Sandjak.Pierce fighting has been reported in the area of Prozor (30 miles S.E. ofJajce) in western Bosnia, as a result of German attacks. Further west nearDrvar the Partisans have taken the initiative and have attacked enemy columns.German attempts to clear the lines of communication east of Fiume have sofar been unsuccessful and they have lost the recently captured town of Delnice(15 miles N.E. of Fiume).Burma.Chin Hills and Chindwin.32. During the past week British troops have been advancing down theroad Kohima-Imphal. On the 22nd, they made contact with Indian troops21 miles north of Imphal. The rapidity of this move came as a complete surpriseto the Japanese who put up only slight resistance before withdrawing eastwardsfrom the road.  The road Dimapur-Imphal is now open to through traffic.Our forces from Imphal have advanced in a north-easterly direction andare now clearing the area four miles S.E. of Karong. Advancing eastwards, our troops have reached a point eight miles west of Ukhrul.Chinese j U,S. Forces.33. After a co-ordinated attack by Long Range Penetration Group columnsand Chinese troops, Mogaung was occupied on the 26th. Much booty, includingarms, ammunition and supplies, was taken.In Myitkyina&apos;, further slight advances have been made in the face ofstubborn resistance.Chinese Ewpeditimayry Force.34. Chinese troops in the vicinity of Kaitou have made some slightwestward advances.Pacific Theatre.   (An outline map of Saipan is included as an inset.)35. In New Guinea, Australian troops advancing along the N.E. coast ofNew Guinea, have reached a point 16 miles N.W. of Bogia, without meetingthe enemy.On Saipan Island, in the marinas, U.S. troops continue to make progressagainst stiff enemy resistance. They have occupied the southern half of Garapan,scaled Mount Tapotchu, and occupied Laulau, on the east coast of the island.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Heavy bombing attacks were made on enemy targets in France,including the flying-bomb bases, and full support was given to Allied troops inthe Battle Area.In Italy, heavy-attacks were continued on enemy communications. oil refineries were bombed in the Balkans.
In the Pacific, enemy airfields in New Guinea and in the Carolines were heavily bombed.Enemy attacks with flying-bombs on the United Kingdom were continued onapproximately the same scale as during the previous week.United Kingdom.37. Flying-bomb attacks are reported in paragraphs 55, 56, 57 and 58.Other enemy activity over this country was negligible.Home Waters.38. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,679 sorties during theweek; nine aircraft are missing.A number of air attacks was made on enemy shipping in the Straits and offthe Dutch and Brittany coasts. On six nights, Swordfish, Wellingtons, Albacoresand Beaufighters attacked E/R boats, minesweepers, trawlers and various small craft and inflicted considerable damage. Five E/R boats were sunk, three were probably sunk, 15 were damaged and five were set on fire. In addition, threeminesweepers and. two cargo ships were set on fire, one cargo ship was sunk and seven others were damaged.Bomber Command aircraft laid 239 sea-mines.Western Front.39. Although bad weather conditions curtailed offensive operations on three days of the week, 15,720 sorties were flown by the A.E.A.F., which dropped 4,392tons of bombs, 9,920 sorties by the Eighth U.S. Air Force, which dropped 9,221tons, and 4,539 sorties by Bomber Command, which dropped 14,377 tons. enemy losses in combat were 213 aircraft destroyed, 18 probably destroyed and 86damaged; 119 Allied bombers and 134 fighters are missing.*F ranee and. Belgium.40. The main effort of the Allied air forces was again directed against enemy communications leading to the Battle Area, and against airfields, fuel andammunition dumps and flying-bomb bases. In addition, close support was provided for Allied troops in the Battle Area. The distribution of effort was as follows :: (a) Rail and Road Communications. Nearly 6,300 tons were dropped on and 1,000 rocket projectiles were fired at these objectives, including the main railway centres in eastern, central and south-western France, and bridges overthe Loire and east and south-east of Paris. A large number of locomotive engines and M.T. vehicles and a considerable quantity of rolling stock were destroyed or damaged..(b) Airfields. About 2,750 tons of bombs were dropped on airfields inFrance, with results which were generally good.(c) Fuel and Ammunition Dumps. Successful attacks were made on manydumps in various parts of France, 1,200 tons of bombs being released.(d) Targets in the Battle Area. The fullest possible support was given to allied troops in the Battle Area, successful attacks being made on all kinds ofmilitary targets, including gun positions, strong points, troop concentrations andat least four headquarters, 1,550 tons of bombs and 1,380 rocket projectiles beingeffectively aimed.. Dakotas and Stirlings successfully delivered supplies andevacuated wounded.(e) Flying-Bomb Bases. On six days and three nights, heavy attacks weremade on launching and supply sites in the Pas-de-Calais and in the Dieppe/Rouenand Abbevihe/Amiens areas, nearly 14,000 tons of bombs being dropped withresults which were generally good.(f) Other targets. Five hundred and seventy tons of bombs were dropped on about 20 electric power installations in Northern France and Belgium and78 tons on wharves at Paris/St. Ouen. Attacks were also made on three radarstations in Brittany.  At St. Malo, four enemy ships were damaged.^Germany and Poland.41. Home-based Fortresses, with fighter escort, bombed targets in theBremen area, dropping 470 tons on Oslebshausen oil refinery, 114 tons on* The results of some of the attacks referred to above are given in Appendix VII.
Wesermunde and 102 tons on Bremen town. Liberators dropped 798 tons onSaarbrucken railway centre.   The results of these attacks were unobserved.Seventy-five escorted Fortresses, from Russian bases, dropped 124 tons of bombs on Drohobycz oil refinery (65 miles N.W. of Stanislau), in Poland. Manyfires and explosions were caused and buildings in the northern and central sectorswere severely damaged. All the aircraft landed safely in Italy.A total of 181 Mosquitoes dropped 48 tons on Gottingen railway workshops(24 miles N.E. of Cassel), 44 tons on Homberg synthetic oil plant (near Duisburg)and a total of 156 tons on Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg and two other objectives.Mediterranean Front.42. During the week ended dawn on the 27th, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 10,806 sorties and dropped 7,383 tons of bombs; 110Allied aircraft, including 68 heavy bombers, are missing and 121 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Weather conditions were somewhat unfavourable, and particularly affected the operation of medium bombers in Italy. Heavy bombers flew a total of 3,383sorties and concentrated on railway targets in north Italy and south France andon oil refineries in the Balkans.Italy. n43. The main effort was again directed against enemy communications.Fighter-bombers flew 1,730 sorties and were most active in the area Leghorn-Spezia-Rimini-Ancona; medium bombers also participated, but their efforts were considerably curtailed by weather conditions. Successful attacks were made onnumerous road and railway bridges, viaducts and railway tracks, resulting incommunications being cut; a quantity of M.T. vehicles were destroyed or damaged.On the east coast, in the vicinity of Rimini and Ravenna, attacks were made on enemy shipping; one ship of 100 feet, two schooners, one tug and a loading bargewere sunk, and two 700 ton coasters and another of 300 feet were probably sunk.Heavy bombers flew 752 sorties and attacked the railway centres in the north of Italy as follows : Modena (100 tons), Ferrara (95 tons), Castel Maggiore(135 tons), Bologna (126 tons), Parma (140 tons), and Fornovo Di Taro (120 tons).The Fiat Works at Turin, an M.T. depot at Chivassa, a railway bridge at Riminiand a bridge over the Piave River were also bombed. At night, 53 Wellingtonsbombed the railway centre at Ventimiglia (80 miles SW. of Genoa) with excellent results and a similar force attacked the oil refinery and railway centre at VadoLigure (4 miles S.W. of Savona).South France.44. A total of 536 Liberators and Fortresses bombed targets in southFrance. The heaviest attack was on railway centres and bridges at Avignon,where 352 tons were dropped with good results. Another heavy attack withexcellent results was made on Oil installations and the railway centre at S te(90 miles S.W. of Avignon). Raids on a smaller scale were made on harbourinstallations at Balaruc Les Bains, where a ship was hit, and on railway bridgesat Aries and Tarascon and the telephone exchange at Le Pontet (N.E. of Avignon).Three enemy aircraft were destroyed and two Allied bombers and two fightersare missing.Rumania and Hungary.45. Good results were obtained in an attack by 233 Liberators on oil storageinstallations at Giurgiu (20 miles S. of Bucharest). At Ploesti, the Dacia andRomana-Americana Oil Refineries were bombed by a total of 467 heavy bombersbut results were not fully observed. The railway repair depot at Craiova(120 miles W.S.W. of Bucharest) was attacked by 146 Liberators with good results, and a smaller force obtained hits on a railway bridge at Piatra (60 miles.W. of Bucharest). In the course of these operations 27 enemy aircraft were shot down and 14 Allied bombers and one fighter are missing.Rakos railway centre was bombed on the 27th and 337 tons of bombs were released in cloudy conditions. -Austria. &apos; V. t   &apos;  -46. On the ,26th, the following targets in the Vienna area were attacked by .S. heavy bombers; reports state that the results at all the locations were good
to excellent : Schwechat, oil refinery and aircraft factory (432 tons), Winter-hoffen, oil refinery (53 tons), Labau, oil refinery (197 tons), Kornenburg, oil refinery (218 tons), Florisdorf, oil refinery and railway centre (217 tons) andMoosbierbaum, oil refinery (246 tons). In the course of these operations 55 enemy aircraft were destroyed and 36 Allied bombers and six fighters are missing.Yugoslavia and Albania.47. Fifty-three U.S. heavy bombers with a strong fighter escort attacked the railway centre at Nish; considerable enemy opposition was encountered and31 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of 10 Allied bombers and sixfighters.The railway centre at Brod was attacked and 336 tons of bombs were dropped and one large explosion and a fire were observed.Hurricanes and Spitfires destroyed or damaged 35 M.T. vehicles, sank oneschooner, and at Zagreb airfield destroyed 10 enemy aircraft on the ground.Russia.48.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.France.1. Avord Airfield. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 25th June, show three concentrations of craters on the landing-ground, one in the centre and one each on the eastern and western boundaries of the field.The whole landing-ground is now covered with hundreds of craters and thereare approximately 75 fresh hits on the runways, many of them at the inter-section point. In the north-west dispersal area, two shelters have been partly destroyed and another severely damaged, and, in the southern corner, fivebarrack buildings have been severely affected and. two small buildings partly destroyed.2. Bourges. Photographs show that, as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the 25th June, further damage has been caused to shops, office buildings,a stores building, &amp;c, of the S.N.C.A.C.

Boulogne. A more detailed study of photographs, taken after the bomber Command attack on the 15th June, confirms the damage and destructionof shipping and port facilities previously reported, and shows, where water isshallow enough to permit interpretation, some 25 vessels which have been sunk or damaged. In addition, a comparison with photographs taken immediately beforethe attack shows that of nine E/R boats then present, only one can now be seen,and that one probably damaged.Other damage now revealed includes sheds in the boat-building yards and warehouses near the docks. At least four cranes have been damaged and the dockwalls and quays breached in many places.4. Bug Airfield. Photographs show that, as a result of the U.S.A.A.F.attacks on the 15th and 22nd June, a large administrative building has been almost destroyed and out of a total of five hangars, one is destroyed and the otherfour damaged.
