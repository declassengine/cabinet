(44) 375.6th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER IN 1944.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.IN the Memorandum (W.P. (43) 539) in which the Ministerial Committeeon Man-power put forward the scheme of man-power allocation for 1944. whichwas approved by the War Cabinet on the 1st December, 1943 (W.M. (43) 164thConclusions), the Committee recommended that the allocations for the second halfof 1944 should be reconsidered in May.2. A review of the position which was accordingly carried out by theMinister of Labour and National Service showed that the man-power programmes for 1944 were not developing altogether along the lines anticipated when the allocations were made. As a result, there would be a substantial gap between thedemand and supply of man-power in the second six months of the year.3.   The chief new factors in the situation were as follows : (a) As a result of increased demands for supplies, the Ministry of supply would not be able to achieve the full reduction of 220,000 workerscalled for by the man-power budget. The short-fall might be of theorder of 150,000 wrorkers.(&amp;) Those industries in Group III (formerly called the &quot;less essential industries&quot;) which were due to decrease, were not yielding upanything like as much labour as expected, with the result that the substantial releases which it was hoped to obtain could not now beexpected. The supply of labour might be reduced bv some 70,000 onthis account.(c) The decline in the total labour force resulting from the excess of normalwastage over normal intake would prove to be greater (perhaps by. 25,000) than had been allowed for when the allocations were made.Taken together, these factors involved a substantial unbalance of the man-power budget. In consequence the Admiralty and Ministry of aircraft production labour forces were decreasing somewhat more rapidly than theirallocations, because of specific labour shortage. The supply of labour for theessential industries (Group II) was lagging behind the allocations, althoughspecial measures were ensuring that the allocations for the most vital industries and Services would be met. Similarly, those industries in Group III which were due to increase were not doing so by as much as expected.4. Thus, it was clear that, even if the provisional allocations to the armed forces for the second six months of 1944 were to stand, there would be a sub-stantial gap in the man-power budget.   These provisional allocations,* however,* These were as follows:  Men. Women.Roval Navy......1    ... 30,000 NilArmy............ 25,000 Nil.R.A.F............. 25,000 NilNursing Services     ...       ...          ... 1,000Total       .:.      ... 80,000 1,000f27772] &quot; , b
were regarded by the Service Ministers as inadequate to meet their requirements.The allocations provided no women for the Auxiliary Services, which meant thatall three Auxiliary Services would run down to the extent that normal wastagewas not replaced, and, although the allocations of men would just about meet therequirements of the Royal Navy and the R.A.F., the allocation to the Army wouldbe insufficient to prevent a serious decline in effective strength by the end of 1944,with a still further-decline during the fh&apos;st six months of 1945. In his Memor-Jindum W.P. (44) 316, the Secretary of State for War has stated that in order to limit the run-down by the end of 1944 to about two divisions and two armouredbrigades&apos; worth of fighting men, and then to hold the Army at this level duringthe first half of 1945, a total intake of 150,000 men would be needed during thesecond half of 1944. He also asks for an.intake of 40,000 men, in order to improve the standards of leave for men overseas, a matter which he regards as of critical importance.5. On the 15th June the Prime Minister asked that the ministerial committee should consider the new situation which had arisen and prepare, forconsideration by the War Cabinet, a scheme on the following basis :  (a) For the present, plans should be based on the continuance of the wTar inEurope throughout the first half of 1945. But by the end of August1944 it might be possible to take a clearer view of the position, so thatfor the present it was advisable to make only short-term adjustments.(b) A temporary increase should be made in the Army intake of men during july and August (say, 15,000 instead of 4,000 in each month).   this increase should be at the expense of the other Services, and should not.   be provided by the call-up of skilled young men from munitions orother essential industries.(c) The Ministry of Supply should conform with t;he reduction of 220,000originally approved.(d) The remaining shortage of labour (amounting to about 100,000) should,in the main be shared between the munitions labour force of theAdmiralty and M.A.P. and Civil Defence. It might also be possibleto make some further cuts on Group II and other industries.6. During the past ten days the Ministerial Committee on Man-power have reviewed, the position, and, after*hearing the views of the Service and SupplyMinisters and of the Ffome Secretary and Minister of Home Security, have agreedto submit to the War Cabinet the recommendations contained in the followingparagraphs7. It will be seen that, whilst in accordance with the Prime Ministerssuggestion we have recommended firm intakes for the Services for July and august only, we have also thought it advisable to recommend a provisional intakefor the three Services together for the following four months, and provisionalallocations to Civil Defence and to the munitions and other industries and services for the whole of the second half of the year. The reason for this is that theSupply Departments must be able to look further ahead than the next two or threemonths in order to work out their programmes; and it is impossible to makeprovisional allocations to the Supply Departments for the full six months withoutassuming some level of intake into the Services, and of allocations to Civil defence and to all other industries and services.8. At the same time we agree that it should be possible to take a eleai-erview of the position towards the end of August, and we accordingly suggest thatthe provisional intakes and allocations for the second half of 1944 recommended inthis Report should be reviewed at that date, when it should also be possible to startlooking ahead into the first half of 1945. Meanwhile, however, we consider thatthe Departments concerned should proceed to take all the necessary steps to work within the provisional allocations which we now propose.Intake into the Services in July and August.M en.9. The maximum number of men who could be made available for call-upto the Services in July and August, under existing arrangements (i.e., with theexisting protection of skilled men in industry), is 38,000. Of these, 4,000 willhave joined the Navy as volunteers before registration under the National service acts.&quot; A further 4,500 must be regarded as earmarked for the R.A.F., consisting
of 2,000 who will have been accepted for flying duties, and 2,500 A.T.C. members who will be needed for ground,service. The balance of 29,500 could all be recruitedfor the Army.10. We have discussed with the Service Ministers the effects of allocationsbased upon these figures, i.e., 4,000 for the Navy, 4,500 for the R.A.F. and 29,500for the Army.(i) Royal Navy. The First Lord of the Admiralty has shown that, even ifthe Navy were to receive their full intake in the second half of 1944, as already approved by the War Cabinet (30,000 men) they would be 25,000 short of thenumber of trained men required to meet their commitments at the 31st March,1945. An allocation of 4,000 for July and August would mean the loss of 6,000men, and, if no compensation were received later in the year, the overall deficiencyat the 31st March, 1945, Would be increased to 31,000. If the Navy were to be allocated only 4,000, he would prefer that there should be an intake of 1,200tradesmen in addition to the 4,000 volunteers, and that the navy should transfer to the Army, as compensation, 1,200 men already in the Navy.(ii) R.A .F. The Secretary of State for Air recalls that the present allocation to the R.A.F. of 25,000 men for the second half of 1944 represents a reduction of6,000 upon his original (already reduced) demand. If only 4,500 men were tobe provided during July and August, and no compensation were to be made later,this would mean a net less of 4,000 men, bringing the total deficiency to 10,000.As a consequence, the R.A.F. would have either to reduce the number of theirfront line squadrons or to place an increased strain upon the men now serving inthese squadrons. Every effort would be made to avoid the first alternative, hutit should be realised that the adoption of the second alternative would mean theincreased use of skilled men to perform unskilled work.(iii) Army. The Secretary of State for War states that, when full allow-ance is made for the saving so far realised in the difference between actual and estimated net casualties in &quot; Overlord,&quot; a total intake of 30,000 men in July and august would enable the Army to save one division in 1945, perhaps by retainingone division below strength in the latter months of 1944 pending its replenishmentin 1945. If part (say, one-half) of an intake of 30,000 men could be provided bya transfer of trained men from the other Services, it would almost certainly bepossible to save one division in 1944, and it might be possible to save another in1945.11. Assuming that the principle of maximum impact in 1944 should bemaintained, but that at the same time the continuation of the European Warduring the first half of 1945 must be contemplated, it would appear that everyeffort must be made to limit the prospective decline in the effective strength ofthe Army to a minimum. We accordingly consider that it is justifiable to ask the other Service Ministers to accept the additional difficulties which would be imposed by the limitation of the intake of men into the Navy to 4,000 volunteers(plus 1,200 tradesmen in return for 1,200 transfers to the Army), and to theR.A.F. of 4,500 men who are already ear-marked. Cuts on the present allocationsare small (and compensation may be provided later), Avhile the relief to the Army-might be appreciable. The allocation of men for July and August would, there-fore, be as follows : Royal Navy       .........      ...        5,200Army       ............&quot;.      ...      28,300 (plus 1,200transfersfrom the Navy)R.A.F.......     v...      ......       4,500Total   ......      ...      ...      38,00012. With an allocation of 29,500, the Army would certainly be able to saveone division. We consider that more than this should be done, and that the army should be provided with an intake of 50,000 men. Unless some of these have tobo used to improve leave standards for troops overseas, this intake should go along way towards achieving the objective indicated by the Secretary of Statefor War in W.P. (44) 316 (paragraph 3), namely, the retention at cadre strength in 1944 of three of the divisions and two of the brigades which would otherwisedisappear. There are two ways in which we consider that an additional 20.000[27772] &apos; b 2
&apos;  men should be provided :  (a) by call-up of men for the Army from the R.A.F.Deferred List; (b) by transfer of trained men from the Navy and the R.A.F.(a) The R.A.F. Deferred List consists of men who have passed certainpreliminary tests for flying&quot; duties, but who are left in Civil life until they are needed by the R.A.F. The purpose, of course, is to ensurethat there is an adequate supply of men for air crews. At the presenttime there are about 34,000 men on the list. The Secretary of Statefor Air has agreed to a reduction of the number on the list, to theextent that by the end of the year it would be reduced to about 14,000men, consisting of about 4,000 who could not in any case be made immediately available and 10,000 to give a three months&apos; supply forthe R.A.F. Taking into account the call-up in the second half of theyear, it can therefore release 10,000 men who could be called up from civil life for service with the Army. In order to make these releases,it is necessary for all the men on the list to undergo more rigoroustests, and this would normally take several months. The Secretaryof State for Air has, however, promised to do his utmost to expeditethis process so as to lead to the release of 6,000 men by the end ofAugust and a further 4,000 by the end of October. The Minister ofLabour considers that it will be possible, by exceptional measures, to expedite the normal call-up for the Army so as to give a further 4,000men during July and August, to be counted against the 4.000 to be released from ihe R.A.F. Deferred List during September and october. On this account we can add 10,000 to the Army intake in- July and August, of whom 6,000 would be called from the R.A.F.Deferred List, and 4,000 from other sources, but counting againstreleases from the R.A.F. Deferred List in September and October.(b) The effect of transfers to the Army upon the Navy and the R.A.F. wouldbe to increase the deficiencies which already exist, or are expected to-&apos; arise in those two Services. Nevertheless, we recommend that everyeffort should be made to transfer 10.000 men to the Army, 5,000 from each of the other two Services, in addition to 1,200 from the Navy onaccount of their intake of skilled tradesmen. The intake into theArmy in July and August would, therefore, be as follows : New Call-up..................      32,300&quot;   Call-up of men from R.A.F. Deferred List       ...        6,000Transfers from the Navy and R.A.F.     ... .    ...      11,200Total        ............      49,500The Navy would have an intake of 5,200 but would lose 6,200 by transfer.The R.A.F. would have an intake of 4,500 and also lose 5,000 by transfer. Themen transferred from the Navy and the R.A.F. should be Grade I, for it is in menof this category that the main deficiency of the Army lies. So far as is necessary,however, compensation should be given to the Navy and R.A.F. by the transfer,as expeditiously as possible, of men of lower medical category from the Army.13. We consider that, by these means, the Army should be materiallyassisted. The Secretary of State for War, in return, has undertaken to consider how far men, who are released by such &quot;cannibalisation &quot; of divisions as may be inevitable and are not suitable for retraining as infantry, could be returned to industry.Women.14. Recruiting of women to the auxiliary Services on a vpluntary basis is atpresent open to women between the ages of V7\ and 19 and, unless it is continued,a number of girls will not be mobilised at all for the war effort. It is estimatedthat a maximum of 7,500 could be obtained in July and August, without unduedisturbance to the general arrangements for allocating man-power. There isalready a deficiency of 3,500 to be made up on the allocation of the A.T.S. forthe first half of the year. Thus, new allocations totalling 4,000 could be givento the three Services for July and August: (a) The First Lord of the Admiralty has asked for an allocation of 5,000women for the second half of 1944, and to the extent that these arenot provided, the expected deficiency of man-power in the Navy willbe increased.
(b) The Secretary of State for War asks for an allocation of 16,800 women in the second half of 1944, and has assumed that these will be forthcoming in the calculations upon which the estimates of the declinein Army strength are based.(c) The Secretary of State for Air states that an intake of women in july and August would ease the man-power position of the R.A.F. to theextent that any gain in women would offset an equal loss in men.We recommend the following allocations of women for July and August:  W.R.N.S..........      1,500* A.T.S.      ...      ...      ...      4,500   (Including 3,500 on account ofv allocation   for   the   first   sixmonths.)W.A.A.F..........      1,500Total       ......      7,500&apos;Intake into the Services from September to December.15. As explained in paragraph 7 above, for purposes of compiling a man-power budget it is necessary to assume some figure of intakes into the Forces forthe remaining months of the year. The most convenient assumption is that themaximum number of men and women who could be made available under theexisting arrangements will be provided. We have accordingly adopted this asthe provisional allocation. The totals for all three Services are 75,000 men and10,000 women. The total call-up for the six months would therefore be 123,000men (including 10,000 from the R.A.F. Deferred List for the Army) and 17,500women; for the year 1944 it would be 294,000 men and 50,500 women.Civil Defence.16. The allocation laid down by the War Cabinet last December involved a reduction in Civil Defence Services (including Police and N.F.S.) of 50,000during 1944. Of this reduction, 27,000 would be non-replacement of ordinarywastage, and 23,000 actual releases. For various reasons the planned releaseshave had to be postponed, though wastage is taking place at the estimated rate.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security considers that it will notbe possible to release more than 11,000 (against planned releases of 23,000) bythe end of September. Additional releases can only be on the basis of the virtualdisbandment of the Civil Defence Organisation in the less vulnerable areas, andhe considers that this could only be undertaken as a result of a decision by theWar Cabinet in the light of a new appreciation of the air risk.17. In present circumstances we consider that it is impossible to ask fora release of more than 11,000 by the end of September. At the same time werecommend that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to undertake a newappreciation of the air risk; and that the Home Secretary and Minister of home security should proceed with the preparation of a plan for the release of personnel, which could be put into operation without delay if and when the WarCabinet decide that some disbandment can take place. Similar plans should, wesuggest, be prepared by the Chiefs of Staff in respect of A.A. defences and fighterstations in the less vulnerable areas.18. The new appreciation and these plans should be available when theman-power situation is again reviewed at the end of August. Meanwhile, forpurposes of the man-power budget, we have assumed that the Civil defence services will be able to release in 1944 the full number originally allocated, but have taken no credit for the possibility of any release in excess of this.Industries and Services in Groups II and III.19. As shown in paragraph 3 above, the industries and services in Group II,and those in Group III which were due to increase, have so far not received theirallocations. This has been the result of difficulties in providing labour of theright type, and, although special measures have been taken to meet the needs ofcertain vital industries and services (e.g., inland transport; the ballot for coal-mining; call-up for the merchant navy), it will not in fact prove possible to meetthe allocations for all these Group II and III industries and services in full.
20. After reviewing the prospects of providing labour we recommend globalallocations of 75,000 for Group II and 35,000 for Group III, compared with theoriginal allocations of 123,000 and 49,000 respectively. In Group II the allocations for coal-mining and the merchant navy should be met in full; that forinland transport has already been met and no further increase should benecessary. The cut will fall on agriculture, national government service(including industrial staffs) and the food industries. In Group III, the nursing services and hospitals should have their full allocation.21. If the War Cabinet approves these global allocations it will benecessary to consider -their distribution among the industries and services concerned.22. For those industries and services in Group III which are due-to give up labour, while it is not now expected that the original allocations will berealised (see paragraph 3 (b)), the Departments should continue to regard theseallocations as targets, and make every effort to achieve them.Supply Departments.23. On the basis of the provisional allocations in the preceding paragraphsthere remains a gap of 264,000 in the man-power budget for the second half of1944, which can only be met by cuts in the munitions industries.24. The evidence which we have received from the Supply Ministers can besummarised as follows :  .(a) The Admiralty has already achieved the full reduction of 13,000 in itsmunitions labour force&apos; which was originally allocated.   The FirstLord considers that a further reduction of 13.000 in the second halfof the year will be possible.   Any cut in excess of this would involve-   a revision of programmes.(b) The Ministry of Supply has been unable to achieve its programme of reduction because of new and additional operational demands. Thefield over which further reductions could be made is limited, and it isconsidered that it would be impracticable to achieve the full reductionoriginally imposed without revision of programmes for essentialmunitions. The Minister of Supply has pointed out that his labour force was severely cut in 1943, and that accordingly the scope forfurther reductions is limited. It is expected that a reduction of 50,000to 60,000 will be achieved during the first half of the year, and thatthe maximum cut which could be imposed for the second half of theyear would be 90,000. Even this would involve reconsideration of programmes.(c) The Ministry of Aircraft Production has already reduced its labour force to the full extent of the full reduction allocated for the year. TheMinister states that this is involving a 3 per cent, short-fall on theprogramme, which will increase to 6 per cent, by the end of the year,even if no further reductions in the labour force take place. Anyfurther cut on M.A.P. must involve a reconsideration of the aircraft programme. On an arithmetical basis, cuts of 50,000 and 100,000workers would mean a loss of 85 and 170 aircraft per month respec-tively.   This would be increased if skilled men were taken.25. It will thus be seen that, in the view of the Supply Ministers, themaximum reduction which can be made in the labour force of the munitions industries on existing programmes is 100,000 at the outside in the second halfof 1944. The gap of 164,000 which still has to be found (some 4 per cent, of thelabour force in question) can probably be found without creating short-falls insupply so serious that the question of Service strength should come into it. But inthe first half of 1945 we are faced with a further reduction in the availability oflabour of some 150,000 before any Service intake is provided for, and all but asmall amount of this must fall as a further cut on the munitions industries. .Wesuggest that before the August review the Supply Departments together should consider; through the J.W.P.S., how the present consequential effect on pro-grammes, assuming that the war continues into the first half of 1945, can beconsidered in relation to Service intakes in the remainder of the year and the tentative figures which we should propose to suggest at that time for&quot; the first halfof 1945.   The result of this examination should be of assistance to the War
Cabinet in reaching the decisions regarding the respective strengths of each of theServices and its associated Supply Department, which will have to be taken before final allocations can be made.. Meanwhile, we recommend the following-provisional allocations to the Supply Departments for the second half of 1944 :  (Thousands.)Reduction recommended in 1944. reduction to be originallyAchieved to       achieved .         imposed forDepartment.                   end of June.

We are clear that Departments should programme down feo theseprovisional allocations (which in itself requires substantial changes); for, even if some slight relaxation were found possible in the August review, it would onlypostpone by a short time the date at which the labour strengths proposed wouldhave to be effective.27. The following Table summarises the provisional intakes and allocationsfor the second half of 1944 recommended in paragraphs 15 to 26 above. It alsoshows the estimated changes in the first six months of the year, and therefore thetotal provisional allocations for the year as a whole.

Our recommendations may be summarised as follows : (i) Intakes into the three Services during July and August should be asfollows : *                Men. Women.Navy     ...............        5,200 1,500Armv (from ordinary intake 32,300;from R.A.F. Deferred List 6,000t) 38,300 4.500   &apos;R.A.F..........    1 ...      ...       4,5.00 1,500* In addition to these items, the decline in the industrial labour force, estimated at175.000, has to be met, giving total &quot; demands &quot; of 630,000. About 45,000 of the intake to theforces comes from unoccupied men and women, so that the supply is also raised to 630,000.*t A.n additional release of 4,000 men from the R.A.F. deferred list will take place inSeptember and October.
(ii) During July and August every effort should be made to supply anadditional 11,200 men to the Army by transferring 6,200 men fromthe Navy and 5,000 from the R.A.F. These should be Grade I menand in their place the Army should transfer, so far as possible, tothe Navy and the R.A.F. men of lower medical category.- (iii) Provisional allocations for the six months, 1st July 31st December, asproposed in paragraph 27, should now be made; and departments should make every effort to work towards these provisional allocations.They should, however, be reviewed towards the end of August,(iv) Meanwhile : (a) The Departments should prepare for the further review in Augustby studying the implications of the provisional intakes andallocations recommended in paragraph 27 above, and should give consideration to their programmes for the first half of1945 on the basis that still further cuts in the munitions industries will then become necessary.(b) The Chiefs of Staff should be invited to prepare, for the sub-mission to the War Cabinet, a new appreciation of the air risk.(c) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and theChiefs of Staff should be invited to prepare a scheme for therelease of personnel from Civil Defence and A.D.G.B. in theless vulnerable areas, which can be put into immediate opera-tion if and when the War Cabinet decide that the risk ofdisbanding these services in those areas can be accepted.J.
