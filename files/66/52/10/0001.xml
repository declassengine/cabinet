The question of our overseas resources and liabilities as they stand to-day and as they will stand at the end of the war with Germany is fast, becomingso critical that I must ask my colleagues to take serious note of it and to considerimportant and far-reaching lines of policy to save ourselves from plunging intoa morass.2. In 1931 our very modest reserves of gold and dollars were exhausted.In the eight years which succeeded, they were very materially replenished,but chiefly replenished by the deposit in London of fugitive short-term money; thereplenishment was therefore largely deceptive; the amounts varied greatly fromtime to time.3. At the outbreak of war, when Exchange Control was instituted, we had some  620 million of gold and dollars.In the ensuing eighteen months this reserve of  620 million, together withvirtually all our overseas securities readily marketable for dollars some 850 million had been used up for the war.4. At this point President Roosevelt introduced the system of Lend-Lease.We have derived great benefit from that and from corresponding actions of theCanadian Government. Largely as a result of dollars received by us to cover the pay of United States Forces in the sterling area, we have again acquiredsome small reserves; they are likely to reach a level somewhat above  400 millionbefore the end of 1944.5. But this is only the beginning of the story. This country alone of thecombatant nations has been compelled, in order to carry on warfare in manylands, to incur vast new liabilities against which the reserve of  400 million is almost trivial.6. In my Budget Speech, I told the House of Commons that, in addition toparting with overseas assets to the extent of  1,000 million, we had incurredoverseas liabilities amounting to  2,000 million. These liabilities are increasingat the rate of over  600 million a year. In addition, in the early post-war years,I foresee a deficit which I cannot reasonably put at much less than  1,000 millionbetween what we can earn by our exports of goods and services and what weshall need to cover our imports of food and raw materials. A large part ofthis deficit (unless otherwise reduced) must be covered in United States and canadian dollars, or in gold.7. Despite Lend-Lease and Canadian Mutual Aid, the problem of externalfinance after the present war will be far greater than that which faced us afterthe last war, during which we incurred liabilities to America of about  1,000million and to the rest of the world of about  400 million. This time ourliabilities may well reach  4,000 million before we can restore equilibrium.Determined and continuous efforts will be needed to apply our very greatproductive capacity in such a way as to enable us to cope with a problem of[27744]
unprecedented magnitude and they must form the background, both of ourinternal policy and of discussions with the United States authorities, whichcannot now be delayed.8. Before Lord Keynes left this country for the International MonetaryConference he gave me a memorandum on this question which is attached. I need not emphasise the extreme secrecy of this document. I think there can beno doubt that Lord Keynes is right as to the urgency of the problem. As regardsits magnitude, there are some grounds for believing that he has erred on the side of optimism, though if we face the problem squarely others may well seereasons to take a less pessimistic view. On certain of Lord Keynes&apos; detailed recommendations as to technical measures I should like further opportunityfor reflection and discussion before making final recommendations to mycolleagues, but there are a number of matters on which early action must betaken.   These can conveniently be divided into A. Negotiations with United States Government; and b. Matters of Internal Policy.A. Negotiations with the United States Government.9. Mr. Stettinius, during his visit to London and in a subsequent con-versation with Lord Halifax, raised the question of American help to us afterthe end of the war with Germany. His attitude is one of great friendlinessinspired by a desire that we should not be hampered by financial weakness inplaying our part as one of the three Great Powers, but he is certainly very farfrom realising the magnitude of the problem with which we are faced. Withsome other Americans we must expect to find not only a total failure to realiseour position, but also a lesser degree of friendliness. Some American Depart-ments will more and more concentrate on demands that we must pay cash for anything likely to have a post-war value. The United States Service Depart-ments are growing more and more anxious to reduce their expenditure and avoidcharges of extravagance.10. The case we have to put to the united States Government will have to be presented at the right moment and in the right way. The preparation of thenecessary material has already been put in hand by the Treasury and Ministryof Production, and we should aim at completing it within two or three weeks.We have the advantage of the presence in this country of Mr. Ben Smith, theMinister Resident in Washington, and of Sir Henry Self, our representative onthe Combined Production and Resources Board in Washington, who accompaniedhim. The case should cover a full statement of what we shall need duringStage II, both in the field of munitions and in the field of non-munition supplies,with a full explanation and justification of our needs. But the contribution which we can make from our own resources to fighting Japan has to beconsidered in the light of our post-war position, and we shall therefore need alsoa full and convincing explanation of the magnitude of the post-war problems which will confront us on the general lines indicated in Lord Keynes&apos;memorandum. Even our warmest friends in America do not understand our realposition, and very many Americans think that when the war with Germany iswon the principle of pooling resources should come to an end.11. The specific proposal made by Lord Keynes in paragraph 32 of his memorandum, that the aggregate war expenditure in India should be dividedinto five parts of which India should bear two, the United Kingdom one and theUnited States two, is one which I should wish to consider further with those ofmy colleagues most closely concerned before I suggest a course of action to theWar Cabinet.B. Matters of Internal Policy.Exports in Stage II.12. Before we can resume exports, our exporters will need man-power, rawmaterials and the factories now used for storage or other war purposes, and these facilities must be made available at an early date if our exporters are to be putin the position of making a flying start at the right moment.13. Meantime the release from war work of a few key men for planning anddesigning (for large a.nd small firms alike) and the release of small amounts ofraw materials for development work is an essential preparatory step. It is amatter of urgency.
14. Once the relative claims on man-power of our war effort against Japan(plus occupation of enemy territory) on the one hand and civilian needs (domestic and export) on the other hand, have been dealt with by the War Cabinet, difficultdecisions will be required as to the extent to which we should keep the domesticconsumer short in order to sell abroad. We shall also need to consider theadministrative machinery to ensure that merchants sell abroad the right propor-tion of their output, and the question of the paramount- need for exports will affect demobilisation also. We should not unduly seek to keep down export pricesduring the transition. This question concerns primarily the Board of Trade, theSupply Departments and the Ministry of Labour.15. We must aim at getting a large fleet under the British flag as soon aspossible both to earn foreign exchange and to be able to buy imports from distantsources where they are cheap and to import cheap bulky things instead of dearcompact ones. It is important to conserve our stocks so as to get our exportsgoing and to reduce foreign exchange requirements when Lencl-Lease stops.Current Preparations for Post-War Export Drive.16. During Stage II and for a time after the war, the demand for our exportswill be great, and the chief problem will be to produce enough. But later onour exports will no longer &quot; sell themselves,&quot; and the promotion of exports by theco-operative action of traders and the Government so as to ensure that the volumeof our exports will be increased by 50 per cent, or more as compared with pre-warwill present a series of formidable problems. These problems include bringingvarious existing industries to a higher pitch of efficiency, setting up new industries and the reorganisation of coal production on a long-term basis.17. This requires action by the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Fuel and power (as regards coal), the Ministry of Supply (as regards iron and steel), theDepartment of Overseas Trade, and by certain other Departments, e.g., by theMinistry of Food as regards whisky. If any of these Departments feel that they need additional specially qualified&apos; staff to deal with post-war exports it is an urgent matter to find them.18. The fact that other countries hold large sterling balances will, if rightlyhandled, provide a stimulus for our exports. Care will be needed so as to makeit clear that our policy is to meet our liabilities in the only way which we canmeet them-by exports and that our action is in no way inconsistent with thepolicy of securing an international code of rules which will limit the use ofdevices calculated to impede trade.Ministerial Committee on Promotion of Exports.19. From now onwards the whole question of exports both during Stage and after the war is of such fundamental importance that I feel that a ministerial committee (backed perhaps by an Official Committee) would be of the greatestuse to keep all the Departments concerned in touch with each other and main-taining a constant review of the work accomplished and the tasks ahead.I believe my colleagues in charge of the Economic Departments would concur inthis view.A agricultural and Import Policy.20. During the war it has been our policy to import what costs least in shipping. The Minister of Agriculture has pointed out that if, as soon as shipping ceases to be the limiting factor, we concentrated our home production on what costs most money, e.g., meat, and made special efforts to increase our production of those goods, we could within a period of 3 or 4 years save a verylarge amount of foreign exchange. He also points out that, if we made at homeagricultural machinery hitherto imported, we could save foreign exchange and infuture build up an export trade in agricultural machinery.21. Similar considerations apply to our import programmes of manufacturedgoods. These (when shipping is available) should be designed to save themaximum amount of foreign exchange&apos; and not (as at present) the maximum ofshipping. In particular, we shall have to consider how far we can import what we need in cruder form and process at home. At the same time we must guard against uneconomic forms of purchasing which will put up prices in this countryand so work to the prejudice of export trade.These points should, I suggest, be urgently explored.
Questions of monetary arrangements with other countries.(a) The Sterling Area.22. During the war the other members of the sterling area have on the wholebeen net earners of dollars and other non-sterling currencies. After the end ofthe war with Germany, or indeed sooner in so far as shipping and suppliesbecome available, these countries, which have for so long been kept short ofimports, will desire to obtain from America whatever cannot be readily obtainedfrom the United Kingdom. The existing sterling area arrangements will needrevision in the light of our large liabilities and very small reserves. This is mainly a problem for the future though it is already beginning to arise in theMiddle East, where Egypt and Iraq are members of the sterling area.23. The proposal made by Lord Keynes is that other members of the sterling area should be entitled to turn sterling into dollars only to the extent that theyearn dollars, plus such further ration as we may from time to time at ourdiscretion feel able to afford on the basis that we shall impose on ourselves similarlimitations as regards dollar imports as we have to ask others to accept. Thiswill need to be applied with some degree of flexibility. The proposals needdiscussion with the Dominions Office, India Office and Colonial Office, and, asregards Egypt and Iraq, with the Foreign Office and the Minister resident in Cairo.(b) Gold sales in India and the Middle East.24. The question of bringing these gold sales to an end is already underconsideration.(c) Gold liabilities to Neutrals.25. We are giving notice to terminate the existing arrangements with sweden and discussions will be opened in the near future. Our arrangements withPortugal, Switzerland, Persia and Turkey will be brought under review as opportunity offers. In these negotiations the Treasury will need the fullestsupport of the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Economic Warfare.(d) Monetary arrangements with Western, Europe.26. Discussions will be undertaken with the Belgian and Dutch finance ministers when the Belgian Finance Minister returns from the international monetary Conference. At a suitable stage there will be similar discussions withthe French.Funding abnormal war balances.27. This is an exceedingly difficult problem or complex of problems, but it isnot especially urgent in point of time. Abnormal sterling balances will have tobe funded, however, before sterling becomes a fully convertible currency.28. I ask my colleagues to approve action being taken on the lines sketchedout above and to confirm the action which is already being taken.J. A.Treasury Chambers, 1st July, 1944.

Copy No.   36I      REVISE.THE PROBLEM OF OUR EXTERNAL FINANCE IN THE&apos; TRANSITION.(ANNEX TO .W.P.(hlf-) 360)1. It is generally recognised that the problem of our external finance afterthe war will be greatly aggravated compared with 1919. because (1) the absoluteamount of our overseas indebtedness is much greater, (2) the loss of our foreigninvestments available as a reserve is more complete, and (3) the current adverse balance of overseas trade which we shall have to meet by an increase of our exports is much larger.2. It is not. so generally recognised that, in addition, two considerablemitigations which were present last time will be absent. The policy of restrain-ing the rise of prices has many advantages, but it will greatly increase the realburden of indebtedness as fixed in terms of money. The other outstanding differ-ence is that last time we borrowed money from the United States which we usedto meet our requirements in all parts of the world, so that we ended the warwithout abnormal indebtedness to any other country; whereas this time theUnited States has only aided us with goods she could herself supply and has notfurnished us with cash to buy goods from elsewhere. Thus, nearly the whole ofour 1914-18 external debt was canalised into the American debt and that weshuffled out of. On the assumption that this time we intend to pay, the factthat we owe money all over the place has, as we shall see, some important offsettingadvantages to our export trade. But it means that the effort required to emergewithout loss of honour, dignity and credit will be immensely greater.3. The Governments post-war domestic policy is based on the assumptionthat we shall be able to import all the raw materials and foodstuffs necessary toprovide full employment and maintain (or improve) the standard of life. this assumption is, at present, an act of blind faith. No means of making it goodhas yet been found. There has never been a more distinguished example of&quot;It will all come right on the day.&quot; This memorandum is an attempt to persuade those concerned to support faith with works. Otherwise, greatdisappointments and disillusions lie ahead.[27620] b
The Dimensions of the Problem.4.   So long as lend-lease and Canadian mutual aid continue, thedifficulty of our position is masked.   The following is an approximatesheet of our overseas position in 1943 :   millions.Imports (excluding munitions and ships) ...Munitions and ships on lend-lease and mutual aidOther War Expenditureabroad (mainly munitions and United kingdom forces abroad)Other &quot; invisible &quot; payments,1501,1507502503,300 Exports (excluding muni-tions)Munitions, services, &amp;c,supplied by United King-dom (on mutual aid terms)Earnings from american forces in United Kingdomand Dominion contribu-tions to W.O.)     ......Other &quot; invisible &quot; income...United States Lend-lease and Canadian Mutual Aid(1,590) less Mutual aid and loans provided by united Kingdom (500) ..\Overseas Disinvestmentultimatebalance-millions.3005004003601,0906503^,3005.   This table shows that we are, at present, meeting less than a quarter ofour external expenditure out of our exports together with the mutual aid we ourselves are affording.  If, however, all war expenditure, lend-lease a-nd mutual aid were to come to an end to-morrow, our imports would be still running at four times our exports. For if all military expenditure were to cease, the imports offood and raw materials which we should require, whilst to some extent changed in character, would not be reduced in amount, since there will be more, not fewer,men in the country to consume food and to be employed in working up rawmaterials.  Provisional estimates which have been made indicate that the currentfigure of  1,150 millions for our imports would also be about right for our import requirements in the first post-war year.   Indeed, it is clear that there will be no time-lag in our import needs, except to the limited extent to which we can liveon stock-piles, surplus stores and salvage.  Perhaps the aggregate amount of theonce-for-all relief from this source might be guessed at  300 to  400 millions,but our stocks are so ill bala?faced that the enjoyment of this relief would have tobe spread over a period.  Better statistics bearing on this from the Ministries ofSupply and Food would be helpful.   On the other hand, there will be aconsiderable time-lag in the development of exports to fill the gap and a stilllonger lag in the date of payment for them.   Even if the export deficit can bemade to taper off over a fairly short period of years, the accumulated excess ofimports over exports, before equilibrium is reached, will be very large.   Wouldanyone guess the cumulative deficiency in the first three post-war years at lessthan  750 to  1,000 millions?   A reasoned guess could only be made bypreparing a practicable target for exports in each successive post-war year,carefully itemised between different classes of goods and agreed with those in touchwith the facts of industry.   No one, so far as is known, is attempting to collectsuch material.    Should not the Board of Trade be invited to make suchan estimate ? The figures disclosed might be extremely disquieting.  It is generally believed that we require an increase over pre-war of 50 per cent, in the volumeof our exports, which at present price levels means an increase to nearly three times in their value.   If, as is probable, this has now become an under-estimate, the Governments post-war plans for full employment are assuming anincrease of at least three times the pre-war figure in the value of our exports.Yet there is not the foggiest hope of achieving this, unless far more vigorousmeasures are taken than are (to the best of one&apos;s knowledge) at present contemplated.   Ministers seem, at present, to be more concerned with the airypinnacle than with preparing the foundations.6. So far we have been dealing with &quot; visible &quot; trade. Shall we have anynet &quot;invisible&quot; earnings from shipping, merchant and banking business andinvestments to help bridge this gap ? In the long- run we should have somethingsubstantial from this source, say  200 to  300 millions. * But in the early period after the war transactions on &quot; invisible &quot; account are more likely to increase,than to decrease, the net deficiency. The scale on which they may do so will partlydepend on our own policy (to which we shall return below). The abnormal out-gomgs likely to cause the deficiency include expenses arising out of the demobilisa-
tion of forces overseas and the clearing up of outstanding accounts and claims for damage and the like.  Our cash expenditures abroad, which now amount to some 800 millions a year, will not suddenly sink to zero when the war comes to an end.We can make no reasoned guess as to the amount of such expenditure after the war or of the period over which it will continue.    Can the Service Departments?Unless we alter our present policy considerably, Relief and Reconstruction abroadwill be another large source of expense.  To begin with, there is our contribution of  80 millions to CJNRRA.  This does not (at present) include our share of thecost of relief to enemy countries. It includes nothing for the restoration of Burmaor Malaya.   It appears that various Departments are contemplating loans oncredits to Russia (whose reserves are several times greater than ours), ChinaCzechoslovakia, Poland and other European countries, amounting altogether to 100 millions or more.  Lady Bountiful is likely, to the best of one&apos;s observation,to continue her gracious activities until she feels the bailiffs clutch on hershoulder, unless something is done about it. Finally, it is strongly argued in many quarters (and with considerable force) that there are important markets in whichwe shall not get a footing for our exports unless in the early years we are preparedto furnish a considerable volume of goods on credit.   It is pointed out that theUnited States will offer medium and long-term credit and that we cannot competeunless we do the like.  What the cumulative total of all this is likely to be in theearly period, it is very difficult to guess.  Would anyone care to put it at less than 250 to  500 millions net in the first three years after the war, unless there is aconsiderable change in the present trend of policies ?7. We have not yet made any provision for the burden of overseas warindebtedness largely in the shape of demand-balances accumulated in London,which at present can be drawn upon with varying degrees of freedom. Finally,therefore, there is the question of the lowest rate at which we must allow thesebalances to be repaid and drawn upon, if we are to maintain our honour and credit. The largest elements in our total indebtedness, as for example, to India,are not, in this connection, so dangerous in proportion to their amount as thesmaller sums which we owe to a great variety of smaller creditors. Once weowe (say)  500 millions to India, which is far greater than we can possiblydischarge in the early period, a further increase to  1,000 millions does not reallyaffect the dimensions of the early-period problem. Thus we have to regard the composition of the debt as well as its aggregate. In particular there are certainclaims against us to which we must surely acco^ a high priority. The crown colonies have lent to us the whole of their currency reserves. The populations of these countries are full of money and starved of goods.&apos; Can we, by blockingthe reserves held against the money, compel them to remain in this position foran indefinite period ? We also hold the greater part, or the whole, of the currencyreserves of Ireland, India, Egypt and Palestine.8. Apart from the larger creditors and from certain less liquid liabilities,the following smaller and more dependent or necessitous countries held sterlingresources in-London at the end of March 1944 as follows :   millions.West African Colonies        ...      ......East African Colonies .......Other British Africa (excluding South Africa)Ceylon   ...  .&apos;......       - -       - -Malaya.........,     .........Hong Kong     ...............British West Indies............Palestine ......Other Colonies and Mandates76.7234399532549379574Iraq      ...      ...      ...      ... ...      ...Netherlands and Colonies    ... ...      ...Belgium and Colonies ...Free France and Colonies and French blocked645317balancesNorway ...Greece   ...Iceland ...ChinaPersia644359t)2115345
9. There are, in addition, the following liabilities of more varying degrees of urgency : (a) the balances in the major sterling area countries whose currency reserveswe hold   millions.India       ..................     797Egypt       ...................    297Eire .............      ...       - - -      93(b) the balances of the sterling area Dominions   millions.Australia  ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 77New Zealand      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      22South Africa      ...............      24(c) the secured loans, &amp;c, from the United States and Canada   mdllions.United States     .........      ......      79Canada     ...............      ...     162and id) the Special Account balances owing to South America and neutralEurope   millions.Argentina ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      52Brazil..................      23Other South and Central America     ...      ...      12Portugal    ...       ...      ...     (a gold liability)      62Other neutral Europe    ...      ...      ...      ...      1610. The grand aggregate, as at the end of March 1944, stood at 2,670 millions. By the end of 1944 the figure will exceed  3,000 millions.Admittedly a considerable proportion of this, say, a half or even two-thirds, canbe funded, or perhaps, if we are tough (which we are not) written off, orrepresents normal working, balances and currency reserves which will bemaintained and therefore, constitute no immediate danger. (Nevertheless even this half will add considerably to our future burden if any significant amount ofinterest is payable on it.) It is the remaining one-third to one-half, i.e.,  1,000to  1,500 millions as at the end of 1944, which is dangerous, because it representsentirely abnormal accumulations which the countries concerned. will certainlyseek to withdraw at the earliest opportunity. Unless, therefore, steps are takento the contrary, it would be prudent to assume that, during the transitional period as a whole attempts will be made to utilise at least  500 to  750 millions, either in the shape of British exports or by demanding foreign currency in exchange.11. As matters now stand and before reckoning any relief from theapplication of the measures recommended below, we are left, therefore, with thefollowing prospective deficit during the transitional period of (say) the first three years after the war, to be found in the shape of new loans or equivalent aid :  .  millions.Excess of imports over exports ... .,, ... 750-1,000Excess of other overseas cash expenditure overincome (i.e., liquidation of war expenses anddemobilisation in overseas theatres, relief,reconstruction loans, export credits, &amp;c,less    shipping    earnings,    net    interestearnings, &amp;c.) ......       ......       250- 500Repayment of abnormal sterling balances      ...       500- 750Total deficit      ...      ......      ...   , 1,500-2,250Nor is there any certainty that we shall have reached equilibrium at the end ofthe three years.The Means of Solution.I. The Sterling Area.12. The easiest way to effect a large change for the better in the aboveestimate of the total deficit is to restrict, during the transitional period, the repayment of the abnormal sterling balances. If the measures recommendedbelow are adopted, there will be a reasonable hope of greatly reducing, or even
eliminating, this item. For, in this case, whilst certain balances would haveto be reduced, other balances might increase, with the result that there mightbe no large net change. This will require, however, a material change in thepresent Sterling Area arrangements, about the practice of which there is a wide-spread and most dangerous misunderstanding.13. With certain foreign countries, of which Argentina and Brazil arethe most important, we have established what are called Special A ccounts, whichare blocked within the Sterling Area (except to the extent that we agree other-wise) and can only be utilised to discharge sterling loans or to buy exports fromthe United Kingdom or other members of the Area. Thus the use of the balances in these accounts may exhaust a part of our export capacity withoutadding to our current resources, or may increase the burden of the balancesowing by United Kingdom to the other members of the Sterling Area. Butthey cannot cause a direct drain on our reserves of gold and dollars. Now itis commonly believed that the sterling balances of the members of the Sterling area are in the same ^position as the Special Account balances, that is to say, thatthey can only be drawn upon for payments in this country or for making transfersto other members of the Area or to Special Accounts and, are, therefore,effectively blocked within it. Unfortunately, this is very far from being the case.The arrangements, made at the beginning of the .war and still in force, arebriefly as follows. (The Sterling Area covers the British Commonwealth,excluding Canada, and also Egypt, Palestine and Iraq.)14. The members of the Sterling Area turn over to us the proceeds of anygold they may sell and the non-sterling currencies they earn from their exports,from United States troops or in any other way. They also undertake to set uplocal exchange controls to prevent movements of capital outside the sterling area and to limit their requirements of exchange to pay for imports coming from outside the Area to what they themselves consider essential. We, on our side, provide their exchange controls with whatever non-sterling currencies theymay, at their own discretion, require. This is not a contractual undertaking, and,strictly speaking, no sterling can be remitted outside the Sterling Area withoutthe specific approval of our Treasury in each case. But the arrangement as described above is the present understanding. The other exchange controls inthe Sterling Area are autonomous and, so long as the present practice continues,we have no.means of influencing their policies, apart from remonstrance. In theearly years of the war, these exchange controls were of varying efficacy. shortly before the lend-lease phase, we were engaged, with some success, in tighteningthem up. With the lend-lease phase, and more particularly with the evolution ofthe Combined Boards and allocation of goods and shipping, the exchange controlsceased to be the effective safeguard. Broadly speaking, most goods which could be allocated would be lent-leased, so that no question of dollar requirements would arise. As soon, however, as dollar goods become available outside lend-lease, then the other members of the Area could call upon us to turn their sterling balancesinto dollars to the full extent determined by the policy of their own local exchangecontrols in granting licences for the importation of such goods. With the recentchiselling of lend-lease such demands are already beginning to arise, especiallyin the Middle East. But it is, probably, only after the end of lend-lease andwith the increasing availability of shipping, that these demands for dollars willbe serious. After that, our only protection under the present practice will bethe measure of austerity voluntarily enforced for our good (and to their owndisadvantage) by such countries as, for example, India and Egypt. It will beseen, therefore, that, unlike the Special Accounts, the Sterling Area system is nota blocking arrangement.  It is, essentially, a pooling arrangement.15. During the war all the members of the Sterling Area, apart from our-selves, have had a favourable balance of payments with the rest of the world.They have also had a favourable balance in terms of United States and Canadiandollars. In such circumstances, a pooling arrangement has been, of course, whollyto our advantage. The sterling balances, approaching  2,000 millions, which theother members of the Area have accumulated in London are an exact measure ofthe favourable balance of each, of them with the rest of the world (includingourselves), which they have placed at our disposal. It is this system which, inconjunction with Lend-Lease from the United States and Mutual aid from Canada, has.solved so successfully the problem of our war-time finance.16. But if, after the war, the tide turns the otjher way and these countriesseek to use these balances for reconstruction, for deferred consumption and toreplenish their stocks, so that they have an adverse balance of payments, theadvantage of a full pooling arrangement is precisely reversed.   Our practice (at
present) is to let them draw on their sterling balances to meet the deficiency. now before the war most of these countries were borrowing countries for capita]development purposes, i.e., they had an adverse balance on current account.Apart from this, they will emerge from the war starved of goods, withabundant purchasing power in the pockets of their consumers and in thebank-balances of their developing industries, and with almost unlimited sterlingreserves upon which to draw. In so far as we can provide them with the kinds of goods they require to the full extent of their requirements, itwould be reasonable to expect them to give us priority. But in the e&apos;arlydays this will be beyond our capacity, whereas supplies which are bothdesirable and necessary may be available from the United States. There is noreason to expect that their exchange controls will voluntarily refuse licences forall imports from outside the Sterling Area for a period which may run into years,if the goods are plainly required and if they are available.17. The notion that the Sterling Area, as at present constituted, is some-thing which we can live upon, is one of the most dangerous of the delusions withwhich we are at present infected. Some people suppose that we can acquire anyproduce we need from the Sterling Area and also the Area&apos;s earnings from the outside world, in return for blocked sterlinggwhich can be used in the last resortfor no purpose except to purchase such volume of our exports as we find our-selves able to supply. It is not generally understood that the pre-war availability of Sterling Area balances for expenditure outside the Area has not, in practice,been suspended, except to the extent that the local exchange controls of the othermembers of the Sterling Area choose to refrain from exercising it. At the presenttime we are protected by the non-availability both of shipping and of goodsbeyond what is released, with our approval, by the Combined Boards. As soon as shipping and goods from the United States and elsewhere outside the sterling area- are again available, full pooling arrangements with the Sterling Area cease to be an asset and become an overwhelming liability. It becomes our responsi-bility to find dollars not only for ourselves, but for all the other members of theArea.18. It is, therefore, an indispensable condition of our remaining master ofour own situation that we should in practice convert the Sterling Area into theclosed system which some people believe it to be already. This is possible by a simple change which will allow us to preserve the full virtue and value of the restof the Sterling Area arrangements substantially unchanged in all other respects.Whilst there can be no hope of persuading the rest of the Sterling Area tocontinue indefinitely on these conditions, we can reasonably press that they accept them for the transitional period, as the best and indeed the only means of safe-guarding the balances which they already hold with us, and to prepare a gradualevolution away from the war-time sj^stem. Moreover, the proposal below lendsitself to a further simple change, to be introduced at the end of the transitional period when we feel strong enough for it, which would allow a permanentretention of a closely knit Sterling Area on principles compatible with the long-term requirements of the proposed International Monetary Fund.19. - The proposed change is that we should limit our liability to find dollars for the local exchange controls of the rest of the Sterling Area to the amountof their own current dollar earnings from exports or borrowing, supplemented by such additional ration of dollars, if any, as we may be able, at our discretion, toprovide for them from time to time out of our own resources. It would then befor them to decide without interference or remonstrance from us how best to spend the dollars thus at their disposal. For this purpose we can probably treat theColonial Empire as, in principle, forming a single pool with the United Kingdom..20. This has three signal indeed, indispensable advantages. It limitsour liability to find dollars out of our own resources to what we ourselvesthink we can afford, and gets rid of an indefinite liability which depends in thelast resort on the decisions of others. Secondly, it makes explicit a principle ofour post-war financial policy which we must proclaim as indefeasible, namely,that we cannot undertake any legal liability to discharge our overseas debt exceptin the shape of our own exports (though we shall try to arrange transfers ofindebtedness to the mutual convenience of all concerned). The formal adoptionof this principle will, of course, give an immense advantage to British exports,since sterling will be the opposite of a scarce currency and must necessarily in theend find its outlet in British exports. Thirdly it enables us to escape from theinvidious position of having to criticise or remonstrate against, the particularrequirements of the local exchange controls for foreign currencies.   For us to
have to argue, without much knowledge of the facts, that India or Egypt usimporting too large a volume of American goods would put us in&apos; an impossible position both towards the applicant exchange control and towards America.The proposed change could be brought about with the smallest amount of troubleand publicity^ because it would merely establish in practice a state of affairs whichalmost everyone, including the Americans, believe to exist already. It would notrun counter to any formal commitment to the Sterling Area and could be putforward (as would indeed be the reality) as an interpretation of the de factoposition.21. This would be the first stage in the evolution of the Sterling Area system.But we could not hope to hold the Area together permanently on this basis. Weshould, therefore, have to prepare for the second stage when we should feelstrong enough to allow members of the Area an unqualified right to spend outsideit the whole of their net current earnings, and. not merely what they earned outsidethe area. This would be tantamount (together with the liquidation of the SpecialAccounts) to the acceptance of general convertibility in the terms of the Inter-national Monetary Fund. We could gradually feel our way to this by increasingthe latitude allowed to the local exchange controls, until we felt strong enoughto go the whole way.22. To prepare for this it would be necessary during the first stage tofund the abnormal balances in the sense of tying them up in the shape of inter-governmental credits which could only be drawn upon at a stipulated rate andsubject to agreed safeguards. There are two foundation principles of policy in handling the abnormal overseas sterling balances which will keep us safe ifwe hold fast to them. The first has just been stated, namely, that we cannotrepay our war indebtedness in any form except our own exports. This means that we do not accept a liability to find gold or any foreign currency. The secondprinciple is that this indebtedness should carry no significant rate of interestpending its discharge.23. This principle is just. To commercialise a war debt between Allieswhich leaves no productive asset behind, as though it were yielding an annual income, would be unreasonable and wrong. Interest, where there is not and inthe nature of things could not have been any current income yielded by the loanhas been stigmatised in most ages of history, except when the false analogiesof trade were wholly dominant, as an intolerable and immoral imposition. to repay capital instalments is bad enough when no asset corresponds to the loan.But it is honourable, having received assistance in kind, to return the equivalentas time and opportunity permit.24. An appeal to this principle is also inevitable. By the end of the transitional period, our overseas indebtedness may reach as much as  4,500millions. To pay (say) 3 per cent, interest and amortisation on this might be within our power some years hence, in spite of the fact that our own offsettingincome from foreign investments is greatly reduced. But for the time beingit is clearly impossible, and probably for some time to come. Last time wehumbugged to the end though the end came almost immediately on the basisof accepting the commercial analogy. We did this in the name of our honour and dignity. And thereby we lost our honour and dignity, as well as our goodword and any reputation we may have possessed for common sense and good,management.25. If we are wise enough this time to refuse the commercial analogy, itshould not be beyond our power to discharge the whole&apos; of the capital sum in the shape of our own exports by gradually rising instalments over a period of (say)forty years; for example, with annual instalments beginning at  50,000,000 and rising by  3,000,000 a year, with some right to anticipate and to delay accordingto our capacity to furnish, and the willingnes of our creditors to accept, a surplusof our exports. This should not mean that all our creditors are paid at the same rate, since a creditor more willing than others to accept capital goods exports,which we are in a position to furnish additional to normal exports, would be paidoff more rapidly. This system should prove a most serviceable aid to the policyof full employment, since we could offer to expedite the repayment of our debtby special exports at times when normal demand was falling away. To declare-what we hope to perform and to perform it will be a better course than to tryonce again, a financiers confidence trick of accepting in name liabilities greaterthan we can meet, and then hope by deft management to keep so many of thechickens in the air that they never all come home to roost.
26. The practical application of this principle will involve many difficultiesinto which it would be premature to enter in this paper. It will be necessary todetermine what liabilities are abnormal and due to the war, and by what data(which may be some time after the end of the war) accumulating balances are nolonger &quot; abnormal and due to the war.&quot; It will require a distinction between&quot;official&quot; and &quot;unofficial&quot; balances. It may be advisable to allow TreasuryBill rate, at least on those&apos; balances which represent currency reservesi ^ thougheven if Treasury BilFrate is reduced to ^ per cent., it would cost  22^ millions ayear to pay this on the whole amount, which would add nearly 50 per cent, to theburden of the suggested initial rate for the discharge of the capital obligation.27. In order to freeze the situation pending the completion of funding agree-ments on the above lines, it would be highly advisable to prohibit the investment of non-resident money in Stock Exchange securities, except on special groundswith official approval. This would prevent the earning of interest by (forexample) our overseas creditors&apos; purchasing gilt-edged securities, and also (whichis of the first importance) a growing foreign ownership of British equities on what might become a substantial scale. Without this provision, which would notbe intended to prevent foreign ownership of stocks of commodities or permanentdirect investments, a time will surely come when Americans will begin to buy usout of house and home and acquire from us our fundamental overseas equities andenterprises.   The early introduction of this prohibition is important.28. If India or any other participant is prepared, in the light of the completed story, to make a free contribution to our costs of the war out of their accumulated sterling balances, well and good. But such gestures, howeverwelcome,- cannot go far towards solving the problem, or provide the basis of our general policy. The right course is for us to declare that we will repay in full outof our own exports the capital sums advanced as and when we can, but withoutinterest; and then make it our business to fulfil this promise to the letter. Thereis dignity and honour in this. Less clear-cut solutions will leave us permanentlywith one leg in the bog, out of which we shall eventually decide to shuffle some-how, covered with mud.II. The Strengthening and Subsequent use of our Gold &quot;and Dollar Reserves.29. A year before the outbreak of war our reserves were very substantial and stood at  1,043 millions. The expectation of war led to a large-scale with-drawal of foreign balances, and at the outbreak of wrar we were reduced to 620 millions. At the commencement of Lend-Lease (April 1941) we were pratically cleaned out, having gold and dollar reserves of  66 millions with 63 millions gold liabilities against them, so that our net reserves were down to 3 millions. Thereafter came the Jesse Jones loan; the old (pre-Lend-Lease)commitments had been substantially met; almost all our current requirements from united States were for a time lent-leased; and the Sterling Area was beginning to gain substantial earnings from the United States troops; with the result thatour reserves began to rise quite steadily. They are likely to reach a peak somewhatin excess of  400 millions before the end of 1944. Unfortunately, awareness by theUnited States Administration of this recovery in our reserves has led to a large-scale curtailment of lend-lease facilities, with the result that we are nowdependent on our precarious earnings from the United States troops to prevent purreserves from falling. When the war in Europe is over, we shall be on the wrongside, perhaps by as much as  100 millions a year, even if lend-lease continues as atpresent; whereas Mr. Stettinius has recently warned us that after the end of theGerman war we must expect food and raw materials to be cut off lend-lease whichwould be restricted henceforward to munitions only. Thus, as matters now stand,we shall-be lucky if we emerge from the Japanese war with reserves of as much as 300 millions, instead of with the  500 millions for which, at one time, we werehoping. Since reserves of about  250 millions probably represent somewhere near the bed-rock figure below which we should not allow our reserves to fall except forthe gravest cause and in extreme urgency, it follows that, unless we bestirourselves, the relief we can obtain by drawing on our reserves in the transitional period is so small in relation to our possible requirements that it is hardly worthbringing into the picture.30. A major improvement in our reserve position can only be achieved if we can persuade the Americans that it is as much in their interest as inours to facilitate the growth of our reserves up to a level more commensurate with our responsibilities. As we approach the war settlement, it will not be convenient to either party that we should always have to plead in forma pauperis
to be excused from full participation. Mr. Stettinius has told Lord Halifaxthat he agrees with this, although his actual suggestions for helping us aremisconceived. It may prove politically difficult for the United States Adminis-tration to furnish us at a later stage with cash dollars, as distinct fromassistance in kind, even though they may wish to do so; yet for many purposesit will be cash that we shall need. It will be a cause of general embarrassmentif one of the three Great Powers responsible for settling the world has no freecash at all. The seriousness of this prospect is not as yet fully realisedby those who will be most hampered by it if it arises. On the assumptionthat we end the Japanese war with net gold and dollar reserves not much above 250 millions, not only would the amount be negligible which we could regard as available; but our free resources would be entirely out of proportion to thoseof our associates. The United States would have sixteen times as much; Russiaabout three times; France more than double; Belgium, Holland, Switzerlandwith comparable absolute amounts and much greater free amounts; and so on.Our position would be ludicrously out of proportion to our responsibilities. Weshould, therefore, aim at an end-war figure of at least  500 millions net andrefuse to undertake any post-war liability to Europe or to anyone else until itwas assured to us. Have we enough guts, here and now, to make the harsh,difficult decisions which are necessary to save ourselves from grave, subsequentembarrassment %31. If the United States Administration could be persuaded that this isfair and reasonable and in the general interest, they could help on the desiredresult in various ways. No further chiselling at lend-lease either currently or after the end of the German war. A generous, instead of a pernicketty, inter-pretation of the present arrangements. Above all, the assumption by the UnitedStates of the entire liability to find gold for the Middle East and India, the proceeds being turned over to meet common war needs in those areas. The last-named measure has been recently proposed by the Governor of the Bank of England.Is it not indispensable that we should now take the initiative to this end % the truth is that we have fallen into a rut in our financial relations with the UnitedStates, and we must jolt them and ourselves out of it. In fact, we are bearing a wholly disproportionate share of the financial burden of the war. In practice wehave allowed critics in the United States to establish the position that we are alot of parasites and outsmarters who are milking the poor Americans for ourown enrichment. It is clearly beyond our power after five years to finance theJapanese war on anything like the present basis. It seems, if this may be said,in parenthesis, that the time and energy and thought which we are all giving to the Brave New World is wildly disproportionate to what is being given tothe Cruel Real World, towards which our present policy is neither brave nor new.32. To make a concrete suggestion. The aggregate war expenditure incurred in India, including the pay of the forces but excluding the cost ofmunitions and other war supplies despatched to that theatre of operations, shouldbe divided into (say) five parts, of which India should bear two, the UnitedKingdom one, and the United States two. These proportions are, at this stage,only for the purpose of illustration and would need careful working out. Theyconsiderably overstate the real share of India, since they would cover her total war expenditure, whereas in the case of the United Kingdom and United States thelarge amount of munitions and stores shipped to India and also naval expenditure would be additional. Thus, a two-fifths share for India, given above for purposesof illustration, is not too high. The proposed relation between the UnitedKingdom and United States shares Avould be justified by the greatly disproportionately-portionate share which the United Kingdom has borne hitherto, and theunmanageable proportions of our already existing indebtedness to India. TheUnited States would be asked to meet their share in the first instance by taking over the full responsibility for sales of gold in India and, if possible, of silver also,and for the balance by obtaining rupees from the Government of India in exchange for dollar balances which would be earmarked for post-war use by India. Thisarrangement would be of advantage both to India and to the United States, by providing the former with surplus funds wherewith to purchase American exportsafter the Avar, instead of her being (apart from her current dollar earnings) whollydependent on imports from the Sterling Area.33.  By disposing of the United Kingdom&apos;s present liability to find gold forsale in India, this arrangement would relieve our reserves of an important cause ofdepletion. But there is also another source of seepage which should be stopped up this flows from the nature of the financial arrangements which Ave found ourselvesT27620] r
compelled to make with certain neutral countries in the hour of our weakness.The &quot;Special Accounts&quot; for Argentina, Brazil and other South american countries, described above, are entirely satisfactory and mean, in effect, that thesecountries have advanced credits to us which cannot be spent outside the Sterling-Area. But Sweden and Switzerland have succeeded, so far, in insisting thatwe should meet all our requirements from them in gold; so that they have very greatly augmented their gold reserves and have accorded us no financial facilitieswhatever; while to Persia we have to pay in gold for 60 per cent, of the Persiancurrency we require. Portugal is in an intermediate position; we do not pay hergold currently, but we have agreed to let her remove her balances in gold five yearsafter the end of the war, if she so wishes, and she already holds  62 millionssubject to this undertaking. These various liabilities to find gold are currentlycosting our net reserves about  45 millions a year. Is there any sufficient justifica-tion for continuing these agreements a day longer than is required by the lengthof notice to determine them ? It will be essential, in any case, to replace them by special Accounts on the Argentine model after the war. Has not the time and thenecessity for appeasing these countries come to an end ? The arguments for con-tinuing financial appeasement which are always readily forthcoming, are not always equally impressive.34. These measures, if taken promptly, should go a long way towardsachieving the desired result of raising our net end-war reserves towards 500 millions. But each month&apos;s delay in putting them into force means some 10 to  15 millions off our final aggregate of reserves. The indispensable pre-liminary to a solution is to persuade the Americans that the above goal is a desirable one for us to reach in the interests of both countries. Until recentlythey were bending all their efforts to reduce our reserves to  250 millions, andhave been far too successful in this direction. At the moment there is a mora-sanatorium on further chiselling and we are being left (comparatively) at peace. Butsniping still goes on and an outbreak of more active measures may recommenceat any time. It is essential, therefore, frankly to put our whole case, set out inthis memorandum, before the American Administration and invoke their aid onthe lines indicated.III. A stiffer attitude towards new obligations.35. The next question is whether a stiffer policy is not called for from all departments of Government so as to reduce the prospective burden on our post-warbalance of payments. Our present attitude towards our Allies and Associates isthe result of several ingredients. In the financial field we have never escapedfrom the consequences of the Dunkirk atmosphere, when we felt alone : thatthis is our war; that if anyone helps it is very nice of them, but we cannot, ofcourse, expect that it should be otherwise than on their own terms; that so far aswe, but not they, are concerned, the future must be entirely sacrificed to the over-whelming needs of the present; and that if anyone wants a douceur he must, inthe interests of getting on with the war, have it. This is the ingredient ofappeasement, right and inevitable once, not so clearly necessary now. Next tLenis our position as a Great Power, equal in authority and responsibility and there-fore equal in the assumption of burdens. This is the ingredient of pride and prestige easily understandable, but nevertheless short-sighted if pride and prestige are, in fact, to be preserved. And, finally, the most sympathetic and natural of all the ingredients, what we have called the gracious activities ofLady Bountiful, all-oblivious of the bailiffs clutch, the universal and unthinking-benevolence of a family which has always felt rich and for whom charity hasbecome not so much a sacrifice as a convention. How promptly and handsomelywe should all subscribe to the Lord Mayor, if there were to be an earthquake in new York! It never occurs to Lady Bountiful that it may be her own dinnerthat she is giving away. If she did, the gift would be worth a great deal more;but would she, in this case, give it ?36. One feels more critical of our own approach after one has noted themore realistic and entirely successful methods of the Russians. For one thenunderstands how little appeasement and gentleness contribute to pride and prestige. But, on the other hand, one feels less critical when one compares how the Europeans and the South Americans and the Neutrals and the Dominionsfeel about us and how they feel about the Americans. Much to be said for ourfollowing the dictates of our own nature. Our Foreign Office could justly claim that it has achieved immeasurably more than the State Department and can countwith pride the number of our genuine friends, even though we have not yet found the answer to the Russian technique.   Less critical again, when one meets the
European Allies face to face and appreciates the extremity of their need and howimmensely they can, if they are succoured, contribute to the excellence of theworld. Therefore the criticism of the previous paragraph, though it is expressed with deliberate harshness, should be applied with much circumspection andmoderation.37. Nevertheless, certain concrete suggestions can survive this scrutiny.The Western Europeans hold large quantities of&apos;gold, with an important portionof which they intend to part to pay for relief and reconstruction. It is right and reasonable that they should do so; for they have escaped hitherto that partof the costs of the war which would have drained off their overseas resources.It will be in the interests of general equilibrium that as much as possible ofthe gold they part with should come our way in the first instance. It follows that we should strictly avoid granting them credits or any special reliefs, andthat our just needs for payment from them should be frankly expounded to them.Nor is it right that France should entirely escape the external costs of the war.At present it is we who have discharged out of our exiguous gold reserves, farless ample than hers, the cost of French munitions ordered in the United Statesand delivered after the collapse. It is expected that by the time we have recoveredMetropolitan France, we shall, as a result, owe the French Government, for whom we have recovered it, a very substantial sum. Are Ministers fullydeliberate and purposeful in all this?   Or is it just happening?38. In regard to Russia in particular we have got into a false position.No one knows accurately the extent of her gold holdings. They may well, bythe end of the war, be nearer to  1,000 millions than to  500 millions. Itis clearly their policy to borrow all they can on easy terms, and to reserve theirgold for eventualities. It is common form to-day to say that Russian credit isthe best in the world. Don&apos;t believe it! They will do whatever suits thembest as circumstances change. (Those who claim her credit is good simultaneouslyargue that we should risk losing our money if we try to press the agreedterms of repayment for what she owes us already.) No one&apos;s credit for anoverseas lean is worth much. However that may be, granting even thather credit is good, we are in no position to lend, whereas she is in a position topay. Moreover, any little thing we could do for her she would regard as chicken-feed and laugh in our face. Let our financial policy to Russia, therefore, berealistic and firm to the fullest extent. In particular, she should pay cash in fullfor all supplies reaching her from the sterling area after the German war is over even though she decides to think again about her relations with Japan.Here is surely .cl ceis6 where weakness can serve no good or sufficient purpose.This is not one of the good cases for running our exports by credits. Russia isas capable of paying us cash now as she will be in five or ten years&apos; time. Andit will be easier to persuade her to pay for goods she wants before she gets them,than it will be after she has got them.IV. The Export Drive.39. One final remedy remains, and by no means the least important, before we turn to the residual problem of post-war financial aid from the United States.This is the overcoming, so far as possible, of the time-lag in the recovery and expansion of our exports.40. The present prospect seems to be that, after the German war is ended,the American economy will be promptly demobilised on a scale sufficient not onlyto allow a return to normal civilian standards, but to provide a considerablesurplus for export. Our degree of demobilisation, on the other hand, although wehave been fighting two years longer, will be greatly less and will not allow any considerable margin for exports. This will have a double disadvantage to ourpost-war finance, both currently in increasing the time-lag and because, when we start seriously to recover markets, we shall start behind in the race. Shouldnot the War Cabinet ask the Chiefs of Staff to think again about the rate ofdemobilisation appropriate to our comparative situation, and the conditions of achieving it ?41. This bad prospect is, of course, aggravated by the fact that, whilstexports are a luxury to the United States, they are a matter of life and deathto us. A frontal attack is needed on the American attitude to our exportingprogramme. Mr. Stettinius has recently given it as a reason why food and rawmaterials must be taken off lend-lease as soon as the German war ends, thatthe continuation of lend-lease (apart from munitions) is incompatible with our[27620] d
being allowed to lift a finger to improve our export prospects. We should impressit on the American Administration that during the Japanese phase it is indispensable for us to make a serious beginning at the recovery of export tradeentirely freed from White Paper conditions, whilst at the same time suffering noabatement in lend-lease aid. A frank show-down with the Americans on this andall the associated issues will conduce, whatever the result, to better relationsbetween us than an indefinite acceptance on our part of what we all of us believe to be both intolerable and unfair. It is time for us, too, to take thought not merely of how to survive, but of how, surviving, we shall live.42. It also seems to one, who is admittedly not fully cognisant of what is going on, that the early problems of each individual export industry are notreceiving the urgent, intensive and realistic study, in collaboration with theindustries themselves, which is necessary to reduce to a minimum the inevitabletime-lag of recovery. No one Department is responsible for covering theexport field as a whole or for setting a target and seeing that it is reached.One cannot say that nothing is being done. But no serious attempt is beingmade to bring our actions into clear conformity with our needs.43. It is all the more reason for vigour in prosecuting the export drive thatthe prospects of success are by no means poor. Our competitive position after thewar is likely to be better than it has been for years. Of our chief competitors,Germany and Japan will be temporarily out of the picture; and the rest ofEurope under great handicaps. The hourly wage in this country is now, on theaverage, a little less than 2/-, but the hourly wage in the United States isabout 5/- ($1); it would be unnecessarily defeatist of British industrialists toassume it to be inevitable that their own methods are so relatively inefficient, thatthey cannot compete in straight manufacture with Americans who are paying-two and a half times their wages. It is true that the members of our ownCommonwealth will be rapidly developing their own industries, but for some time at least this will create a demand for capital goods which we are well qualified to supply/and in the longer run new needs and the demand for higher standards of quality may maintain demand. Finally our best customers are in command of as much sterling as we feel able to release to them, solely available (if the above recommendations are accepted) for purchases in our market an entirely novelsituation. Sufficient vigour applied to these initial advantages may produceresults far in excess of the present general expectation. These results will notjust happen, any more than the creation and equipment of a great army justhappens. But the application of the same energy and the same single-mindednessof purpose will work the same miracle, and work it quickly. This will requireat the start not merely the means and the incentive to produce, but also the samesevere stinting of the &quot;home consumer, although, haying already put up with it for so long, he could reasonably have expected relief. The country must learn tobelieve that these are the conditions of our economic health and&apos; financial independence, and the only means by which wre can consolidate the position whichwe shall have won in other fields.The Residual Problem of Aid from the United States.44. The adoption of the above recommendations would very greatly reducethe size of the uncovered balance. But inevitably there will remain a substantialsum for which we must look to the United States. There is no. sufficient reasonto doubt that the Americans will, on terms, give us all the accommodation wemay require. That is what both the present Administration and the New Yorkbankers are contemplating. Indeed, they are likely to offer us considerably more than it will be wise for us to accept. It is not the quantity of the accorn-modation about which we need worry. It is the terms and tne consequences of losing our financial independence which should deeply concern us. Thereare three reasons why we must reduce our requirements for American aid to theleast possible ^say, to $2 to $3 billions ( 500- 750 millions); and even beprepared, if the worst befalls, to do without it altogether.45. In the first place, we shall never reach financial equilibrium with the outside world except under heavy pressure. If money is too easy to come by inthe early stages, we shall acquire habits which it will be beyond our capacity to maintain, and which must lead to an eventual general default to our overseascreditors, with all the loss of prestige and authority which that will involve.
46. We must not engage ourselves beyond our reasonable capacity to pay,conservatively estimated. From this point of view $2 to $3 billion may be luliyhigh, even if the terms of repayment are as easy as those suggested below.47. Any accommodation we accept from the United States must be on our terms, not theirs. Recent discussion in the United States and evidence given before Congress make it quite clear that there are quarters in the United Statesintending to use the grant of post-war credits to us as an opportunity forimposing (entirely, of course, for our good) the American conception of theinternational economic system. It is not as generally recognised in Whitehallas it should be, that the Article VII conversations, if carried to a successful conclusion with all the safeguards on which we should insist, may becomeour sheet-anchor of safety. In recent evidence before Congress, theviews were expressed (and sympathetically received) that the conditions offinancial assistance to Great Britain should include the abolition of imperial preference, the linking of sterling, to the dollar (thus, as it was said in the hearing, defeating Lord Keynes&apos;s efforts to prevent by a monetary plan any effective return to gold), and the abolition of exchange controls preventing the Sterling Area balances now in London from being spent on thepurchase of American exports. Not all of this need be taken too seriously. but three conditions are, undoubtedly, in view and would probably commend them-selves to Congress and to American opinion generally as being just and.reasonable. The first is the linking of sterling to the dollar, which everyAmerican banker puts in the forefront. The second is the freeing of some partat least of the Sterling Area balances in London for the purchase of Americanexports, thus canalising debts, which we now owe to our normal customers andwhich are only payable in terms of our exports, into a debt payable in gold to a country which does not buy our goods on any scale. The third, which is vaguer,might relate to the form of the assistance, which.would not be in the shape of free cash but would, though repayable in cash, be on the model of lend-lease and require us to take American produce on a scale and at prices which wouldnot suit us.48. The Americans also probably contemplate, at present, an interest rateof 2 to 2^ per cent, as well as the repayment of the capital sum by annualinstalments. A substantial loan (say, $5 or 6 billions) on such terms wouldinvolve us in a liability greater than we can, with any confidence, expect todischarge. It may be, however, that even a serious doubt about our capacity topay would not trouble the Americans unduly. They want to get their stuff outsomehow, and our obligation is better than most. They would not be undulyreluctant to accept the risk of our falling into the humiliating position ofbankruptcy and having to come back to them for mercy later on.49. In the negotiations with the United States we must, therefore, regardone principle as absolute. We will not borrow dollars on our own credit in orderto allow Sterling Area countries (other than the Crown Colonies) to buy UnitedStates exports out of their sterling balances. Any accommodation which is found for them must be on their own credit. This principle is of first-class importancebecause, as we have seen, there will be great pressure on us to abandon it. TheUnited States Treasury will be very jealous of the benefit to British exports ifit is British exports, and British exports alone, which can be purchased out ofthe sterling balances. They will be quite happy to canalise a proportion of ourpresent debt to the Sterling Area into a debt to themselves. We can predictwith some confidence that their offer will in fact be along these lines. Forexample, they may offer us $5 billion on easy terms, provided we devote (say)12 to 3 billion of this to turning abnormal Sterling Area balances into dollars.Sometimes it appears to us (perhaps unjustly) that the United States treasury would prefer us to end the war with exiguous gold and dollar reserves so thatthey will be in a position to force this solution on us. Moreover, this plan would obviously suit other members of the Area, who would be organised to put pressure on us to accept it.50. In view of all this, what form and measure of assistance should weaim at ? Clearly we should seek to obtain as much as possible -on Lend-Leaseterms -in other words, as a contribution to the costs of the war. This wouldhave to be under new legislation. But if the United States Administrationwished to help us (and others)&apos; on these lines, all sorts of formulae of justificationcould be worked out. The ideal arrangement would be (say) $ 1 or 2 billion ingoods on Lend-Lease terms and $1 or 2 billion in cash, repayable.   But whether
the cash accommodation is 11 or 3 billion, it must be without interest, at anyrate until we can see our way clearly to repay. For example, assistance might take the form of an advance without interest fixed for ten years, at the end ofwhich term the conditions of repayment would be considered, and mutually agreed in the light of our capacity at that time to discharge it out of our exports.51. Rather than accept terms we think unsuitable or beyond our power tosatisfy, we should decline assistance altogether. This is hard doctrine. It might mean a postponement of much that the public is being led to expect. But if we take thought for our ultimate strength and independence, it will be greatly worth-while. Moreover, if we are genuinely prepared to take this course, we shall, inall probability, get what we want. For one thing, when the world knows the wholestory, our case is just. There is no reason why we alone should emerge with vastwar debts to our Allies. We must declare unequivocally that the limits withinwhich we will accept this position are narrowly defined and will be defined by ourselves. For another thing the Americans, rightly approached and franklyhandled, are a generous people. Above all, perhaps, the advantage is not all onour side. If we refuse to accept financial assistance from the United States, itwill cause nearly as much embarrassment to them as to us.Conclusion.52. Our own habits are the greatest obstacle in the way of carrying outalmost every one of the above recommendations. All our reflex actions are thoseof a rich man, so that we promise others too much. Our longings for relaxationfrom the war are so intense that we promise ourselves too much. As a proud andgreat Power, we disdain to chaffer with others smaller and more exorbitant than ourselves. Having been so recently in dire extremity, our financial diplomacyis rooted in appeasement. Above all, the financial problems of the war have beensurmounted so easily and so silently that the average man sees no reason to suppose that the financial problems of the peace will be any more difficult. The supply departments have demanded of the Treasury that money should be no object.And the Treasury has so contrived that it has been no object. This success isthe greatest obstacle of all to getting the problems of this memorandum takenseriously. And when we come to exports, no one ever seems to suppose that we need expect to be paid cash for them in full exports for relief purposes, exportson credit, exports for prestige and propaganda, exports below world price so as to gain satisfied customers five years hence; never exports so that we can live.53. Our final conclusion concerning the scale of residual assistance required from the United States is, unfortunately, based on the assumption that the preceding -ing recommendations have been substantially (and successfully) acted upon. Ifthey are largely rejected, the best alternative (and one which it is ill-omened to mention, since it is so likely to be adopted) is to borrow all we can from theUnited States on any terms available, and in due course shuffle out. the americans, as we have mentioned above, may positively tempt us to this course.No comfort, therefore, unless it be from the following story. In 1755 LordChesterfield, under the influence of gout, wrote from Bath to Mr. Dowdeswell, theChancellor of the Exchequer in that time of war, that Lord Orford (Sir RobertWalpole) &quot;who was as sanguine as anybody, used always to say that whenever the National Debt should amount to 100 millions, the whole would be over andthe game up. And this will certainly be the case should this war last four yearslonger &quot;; to whom the Chancellor replied that he knew no answer to His Lord-ship^ argument, but that he had great faith in the dictum of Voltaire that &quot; theprobable very seldom occurs.&quot;12th June, 1944.
