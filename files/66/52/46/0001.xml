Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1944.W.P. (44) 396.18th July, 1944.SECRET.\Copy No.WAR CABINET.GANDHI&apos;S RECENT MOVES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.1. My colleagues would no doubt wish to have a brief review of the politicalpronouncements made recently by or on behalf of Gandhi. On the 29th June he made his first approach to a public appearance since his release in an address toa small group of Congress workers, in which he reaffirmed his belief in non-violence and non-violent non-co-operation, and urged Congressmen to have faith in their cause and avoid any sense of frustration over the failure of 1942. Onthe 8th July Rajagopalachari published details of his correspondence and discussions with Jinnah earlier this year on the heads of a proposed Congress-Moslem League Settlement, which, he stated, had been discussed with, and approved by, Gandhi in March 1943. The proposition was that Gandhi andJinnah should agree to accept these heads and recommend them to the congress and Moslem League respectively. Jinnah was prepared to submit these proposals to the Working Committee of the Moslem League if he received the proposals from Gandhi direct, but declined himself to accept responsibility for them.Rajagopalachari replied that it was no good Jinnah doing this unless he supported the proposals himself, and the correspondence terminated. The essence of theproposals was a conditional and partial concession of &quot; Pakistan &quot;-a right to&quot;contiguous districts in N.W. and N.E. India,&quot; where the Moslem population has an absolute majority (to be demarcated after the War), to decide by plebiscitefor or against separation, the offer being conditional &quot;on the transfer by GreatBritain of full power and responsibility for the governance of India. Thepublication of these proposals had a mixed reception. The concession of Pakistanwas hailed by the Moslem League Press but strongly condemned by the HinduMahasabha. It is improbable, however, that the Moslem League could acceptthe offer as it stands, as the term &quot; contiguous districts with an absolute Moslemmajority &quot; can be interpreted as excluding from Pakistan considerable areas ofthe Punjab and Bengal (including Calcutta) and nearly the whole of Assam. Theoffer also fails to define the communal proportions in a transitional Government,and may preclude a British guarantee to the Moslems as the proposals are bindingonly on transfer of power to Indian hands. Gandhi&apos;s approval of the proposalsseems undoubted, but his motive is obscure. Probably he regarded the formulaas a test of opinion and was prepared to adjust his future policy according tothe ensuing reactions.2. There followed a series of statements by or attributed to Gandhi. the news Chronicle published a report of the interview with Gandhi by theircorrespondent, Gelder. This report was stated later by Gandhi to be fairlyaccurate but to contain some glaring inaccuracies, and on the 12th July he issuedtwo statements which together covered the same ground as Gelder&apos;s despatch.He described them as notes prepared after discussion with Gelder, the firstpurporting to be notes kept for publication after Gelder had communicated hisimpressions of Gandhi to the Viceroy, the second to be notes for the journalistto discuss with anyone wishing to understand Gandhi&apos;s mind. The substance ofthe first statement is that Gandhi would explain, if the Viceroy saw him, thathe is ready to help and not hinder the war effort, but that he could do nothingwithout seeing the Working Committee.[27839]
3.   The second statement added the following points : (a) That Gandhi would never use the weapon of civil disooedience duringthe war unless for a very grave reason, such as the thwarting ofIndia&apos;s right to freedom; he has no intention of offering civildisobedience to-day;(b) That he would be satisfied with a National Government with full controlof the civil administration composed of persons chosen by the elected members of the Legislative Assembly; this would mean a declarationof independence qualified as in (e) below during the war;(c) That the Viceroy would be, like the King of England, guided byresponsible Ministers;(d) That popular  government  would  be  automatically  restored  in  allProvinces;(e) That while under the National Government the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief would have complete control of military operations, therewould be a portfolio of Defence in the hands of the National Govern-ment, which &quot; would be genuinely interested in the defence of thecountry and may render great assistance in the shaping of policies &quot;;(/) That Allied Forces would be allowed to carry on operations on Indiansoil : the expenses of such operations should not be borne by India; and(g) That Gandhi would advise Congress to participate in the national government if formed.4. On the 14th July the Press published oral explanations given by Gandhito press correspondents.  Leading points are : (1) The statements constitute gandhis personal effort to end the deadlock.(2) If his suggestions are not accepted by Jinnah or by the powers that be,he would consider it most unfortunate. If there is a hearty response.* there will be no occasion for civil disobedience. Jinnah is not to blame; the British are using him as a pretext to deny India freedom.(3) The All-India Congress Committee alone can alter the 1942 Resolution;it has not lapsed, but only Gandhi&apos;s authority under it to start masscivil disobedience; if Government interferes with the activities of congress the right of individual civil disobedience remains.(4) His present proposals are quite different from the Cripps&apos; offer, whichcontemplated &quot; almost perpetual vivisection of India.&quot;There will no doubt&apos; follow yet further statements by Gandhi and further efforts by his friends and his critics to clarify his policy. For the moment I needpoint only to the demand for the abolition of the Viceroy&apos;s reserve powers overthe whole field of Government apart from military operations, to the absence ofclear proposals for the composition of the &quot; National Government,&quot; to the apparent contradiction between his latest condemnation of &quot;vivisection&quot; andthe Rajagopalachari proposals, to the unsatisfactory nature of his suggestions for the control of defence during the war, and to the implied threat ofcivil disobedience if his suggestions are rejected by Jinnah or by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.I append the latest telegram which I have received from the Viceroy, inwhich he reviews the situation. There is to be a debate on India in the lords in reply to a question down for the 26th July and also in the Commons next week or the week after. It will hardly be possible to follow the Viceroy&apos;s line and tosay nothing at all about these moves. But it will, no doubt, not be worth whilegiving them an undue importance by examining them in greater detail than maybe required to indicate their lack of any genuine desire to arrive at an early settlement.L. S. A.India Office,18th July, 1944.
APPENDIX.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated Ibth July, 1944.(164 S.C.)Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Ambassador,Washington. My telegram No. 1389 S of 12th July. Gandhi&apos;s views and intention are still obscure.2. Timing of published statements might appear to indicate that Gandhiwished first to immobilise Moslem League by unacceptable offer to Jinnah (whowas violently attacked in Nationalist Press from 10th July onwards) beforeissuing main proposals to address of His Majesty&apos;s Government and Governmentof India.   This is conjectural, but is possibility.3.   Main planks of Gandhi&apos;s plan seems to be as follows : (a) &apos;&apos; National   Government&apos;&apos;   (composition   and   method   of   formationundefined) to have entire control of Civil Administration at thecentre.(b) Provincial Ministries to be reformed in Section 93 Provinces (method notindicated).(c) Governor-GeneraFs powers to be restricted to those of constitutionalmonarch acting on the advice of Ministers.(d) Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief to have control of militaryoperations and Allied forces to be permitted to operate on Indian soii,but not at India&apos;s expense.4. Gandhi puts forward plan only in personal capacity and must seeWorking Committee to secure Congress co-operation. He would advise congress to accept above proposals and take part in National Government. He would apparently like to see me first and assure me that his proposals would nothinder the war effort. He regards the quit India resolution as innocuous andhas no intention of withdrawing it. He utters somewhat vague threat thatrefusal by His Majesty&apos;s Government and Moslem League to accept plan mightjustify Civil Disobedience. He says he is not reverting to Cripps offer, &quot; as this contemplated perpetual vivisection of India and would have created effectivebarrier against Indian independence.&quot;5. Gandhi&apos;s short-term object is probably (? negotiations) with and releaseof Working Committee. He would press for &apos;&apos; National Government&apos;&apos; of kindindicated by him and might threaten civil disobedience in the event of failure. The offer to Jinnah was so vague and unsatisfactory that League willnot co-operate, and this was probably intended by Gandhi. Moslem feeling willbe alienated by renewed pronouncement on &apos;&apos; vivisection &apos;&apos; of India. He must also be aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not agree to &quot; national government&quot; outside framework of present Constitution; that Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief are not responsible for military operations; andthat it is impossible in war to separate civil government from defence. In short,he has propounded plan which is meant to appear conciliatory in the know-ledge that it will not be accepted and in the hope of making His Majesty&apos;sGovernment appear intransigent and put himself and Congress back in thelimelight.6. Confused presentation of plan has not enhanced Gandhi&apos;s reputation andthere may be further explanations to follow.7. I am clear that correct policy opening is to say nothing and to permit nocontact with Working Committee. Should Gandhi make really constructiveproposal direct to me, I would ask for further instructions. But I would not be impressed by any plan which does not provide adequately for Moslem co-operation and recognise impossibility of radical constitutional changes during the war. our attitude should not be to criticise plan as unacceptable, but to wait for responsibleopinion to see for itself that plan in present form is unworkable and unacceptable to Moslems and ourselves.
