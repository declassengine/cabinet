NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.THE principal features of the week under review have been increasedshipping losses from U-boat and air attack, and air attacks on southern naval bases.Home Waters.2. H.M.S. Norfolk and H.M.A.S. Australia carried out a sweep as far northas Bear Island, but sighted no enemy ships or fishing fleets.H.M. Sloop Penzance, while escorting a convoy, was torpedoed and sunk onthe 24th August 650 miles west of the Bloody Foreland. Four officers and ratings were rescued, and it is believed there are 5 other ratings in another ship.H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Dunnegan Castle was hit by two torpedoesat 2300 27th August when 120 miles west of the Bloody Foreland and subsequentlysank. As far as is known 34 officers and 210 ratings have been saved. Shewas acting as ocean escort to a homeward-bound convoy from Sierra Leone.A floating dock was successfully towed from the Tyne to Scapa, one AA.cruiser, 4 sloops and 5 trawlers acting as escort.M.T.B.&apos;s carried out patrols off the Dutch Coast on nights of the 25th, 26thand 27th August without making contact with enemy forces.An enemy ship, painted as a hospital ship, was sighted in the Channel by aircraft on the 25th and again on the 26th. Seven E-boats in the vicinitywere unsuccessfully attacked. The German Government has given notice that64 small vessels marked with a Red Cross are to be used for rescuing airmenfrom the sea. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not recognise these vessels as coming within the protection of the Red Cross.3. H.M. Naval establishments and dockyards were subjected to air attackduring the week. Portsmouth dockyard was attacked on the 24th, and h.M. Destroyers Acheron and Bulldog were damaged, the former having herstern blown off. Some damage was done to dockyard buildings, but no vital targets were hit. A direct hit on an air raid shelter caused 24 deaths and 42 wounded.Fort Cumberland (R.. Marine Barracks) was attacked on the 26th, some60/70 bombs being dropped. Considerable structural damage was done to buildings. Four Officers and 4 men were killed, and 3 Officers and 10 menwounded. The Gun Wharf was slightly damaged on the 27th, and also somebuildings at Priddys Hard (armament depot).The fuel oil cisterns at Pembroke, which are still burning since the attack onthe 19th, were again attacked by a single aircraft on the 25th, no further damagebeing done. Portland oil cisterns were bombed on the night of the 25th August,but fires were quickly extinguished.Thirteen H.E. and incendiary bombs were dropped on Chatham dockyardat 2100 28th August, but only slight damage was done.    Some delayed actionbombs were used in the attacks on Portsmouth and one &apos;&apos; dud &apos;&apos; bomb wasdiscovered at Chatham. y.Wo4. H.M. Trawler Arctic Trapper shot down -^ee^ enemy aircraft whenattacked in the Downs on the 24th August. The R.FA. Looe and H.M. DestroyerVersatile were also unsuccessfully attacked in the St. George&apos;s Channel and offthe Wash respectively.The Swedish S.S. Goteberg left Petsamo for Iceland with a German safeconduct, repatriating British military personnel from Sweden.Mediterranean.5. H.M. Destroyer Hostile, the last in the line of four destroyers on passage from Malta to Gibraltar, was mined and sunk at 0317, the 23rd August, whenoff Cape Bon. The flotilla was steaming at 30 knots. One officer and four ratingswere killed and three ratings wounded, the remainder of the officers and ship&apos;scompany being picked up by destroyers in company.On the 23rd August three Swordfish aircraft, supported by a unit of theR.A.F., attacked with torpedoes enemy ships at Bomba and sank one destroyer,two submarines and a merchant ship of 2,000 tons, believed to be the S.S. Lero.
The seaplane base was bombarded by destroyers. H.M. Ships Ladybird andWaterhen attacked Bardia, p.m. the 23rd August. H.M.S. Ladybird penetratedinto the harbour but found no shipping there. Both ships then bombarded shoretargets and troop concentrations. Owing to darkness&quot; it was not possible toestimate the damage. H.MA.S. Sydney acted in support of these operations.H.M. ships Kent and Gloucester and three destroyers carried out a sweep in theEastern Mediterranean to provide cover for merchant shipping proceeding fromthe Piraeus to Port Said. This force was attacked on its way back off Alexandriaby torpedo-carrying aircraft without success.H.M. Submarine Rorqual sank two enemy merchant ships 16 miles N.W.of Derna on the 21st August.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. Eight attacks by surface craft and seven by aircraft were made in thevicinity of the British Isles, and one by surface craft in the Mediterranean.None of these attacks are considered to have been successful.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.7.   Losses have been very heavy during the week under review.Thirteen British ships of 77,317 tons were sunk by U-boat, and 5 british ships of 29,891 tons by aircraft attack. Three neutral ships of 12,560 tons were sunk by U-boat and 1 Norwegian ship of 6,114 tons by surface raider. No ships were sunk or damaged by mines. The total loss of tonnage is 125,882 tons.Fourteen of these ships were in convoy.A homeward bound convoy from Halifax started with 51 ships, of which only 43,,arrived safely. The convoy was attacked twice by U-boats and once(by aircraft.Ships using the St. George&apos;s Channel were attacked by aircraft on several occasions.Protection of Seaborne Trade.8. 1,144 ships, including 153 Allied and 89 neutral, were convoyed duringthe week ending noon 28th August, of which 7 ships were torpedoed and 4 lost by air attack. 1 cruiser, 10 armed merchant cruisers, 33 destroyers, 14 sloopsand 21 corvettes were employed on escort duties.Total losses in convoy since commencement of hostilities are British 78,Allied 8, Neutral 5, Total 91, giving a ratio of losses to numbers convoyed ofBritish 1 in 352, Allied 1 in 381, Neutral 1 in 747, total 1 in 376.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the24th August were 1,152,541 tons compared with 1,062,016 tons during the weekending the 17th August. Oil imports in 27 tankers totalled 273,358 tons, anincrease of 108,090 tons on the previous week. Mineral imports amounted to291,350 tons, of which 205,931 tons were iron ore, steel and scrap iron. cereal imports were 225,348 tons, 16 ships being fully loaded with grain. Other food imports totalled 136,133 tons, of which 58,934 tons were sugar, 12,819 tons wererefrigerated and tinned meat and 10,665 tons were fresh and dried fruit. Therewere 428 tons of rum from the West Indies, and 292 tons of wine from Lisbon.Timber and wood pulp imports were 129,600 tons; among other imports were largeconsignments of jute, linseed, cotton and cotton seed.Enemy Intelligence.German.9. There is no further information available as to the whereaboufc-s of theGerman Main Units except that contained in reports of the air reconnaissance ofthe 28th August which showed Gneisenau in the Northern floating dock at Kiel,the battleship Tirpitz and an 8-inch cruiser in the Bauhafen at Wilhelmshaven,and the battleship Bismarck in Hamburg.[21689] B
The main concentration of U-boats has been in the North-western approaches. A total of 10 U-boats have been operating daily during the period under review including 3 Italians in the latitude of the Azores. H.M.S. Penzancewas sunk as far west as 27&quot; W. This U-boat might possibly be bound for the halifax area.German Raiders.10. A description of a raider has been obtained from survivors of theNorwegian Beaulieu attacked on the 4th August in a position 26 : 30 N. 48 W.(Atlantic). The raider is said to have resembled a fruit boat of the German S.S.Ahrensburg type of about 4,000 gross tons. The ship had a slightly inclinedstem, cruiser stern, squat funnel and a low bridge with passenger accommodation.The raider used pom-pom and machine-gun fire at first and heavier gunsafterwards.At 0130 the 27th August the tanker British Commander reported beingshelled by a raider 240 miles south of Madagascar. A second message purporting to come from the British Commander cancelling the raider report is consideredof doubtful authenticity.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.11. There have been no important movements of German merchant shipsduring the week.   Trade in the Baltic and Kattegat continues.The S.S. Weser, at Manzanillo, applied on the 15th August for 1,800 barrelsof oil fuel and 1,000 drums of diesel lubricating oil. As a Norwegian tankerhad just discharged 19,994 barrels of oil fuel at Manzanillo, the S.S. Wesermoved to the oil wharf to load. Practically no lubricating oil is available inManzanillo and it would take some days to transport overland from Tampicothe quantity required by the German ship.Italian.12. Apart from the sinking of three, possibly four, Italian merchant ships by our submarines in the Mediterranean and Adriatic there is little to report.There is some regular traffic in the Black Sea, the Tanker Maya, for example,trading from Batum to Varna. Regular trading is also carried on in the adriatic.Arrangements have been made to supply the S.S. Conte Biancamano (23,255tons) at Colon, with a thousand tons of fuel oil.British Minelaying.13. H.M. Ships Southern Prince, Menestheus, Port Napier and Port Quebeclaid 960 mines in the North Rona area on the 21st August. Minelaying in theEast Coast Barrier was continued by H.M. Ships Teviot Bank and Plover andthe Dutch iWillem Van Den Zaan. 442 were laid on the 25th August, 240 onthe 27th August and 170 on the 29th August. Minelaying by aircraft has beencarried out by Bomber Command in the Bay of Biscay area and by coastal command off the Dutch and Flemish coasts.Enemy Minelaying British Minesweeping.14. Although minelaying by enemy aircraft has been widespread duringthe week the 21st August to the 28th August, it has not been as intensive as on various other occasions.There has been a marked tendency lately for magnetic mines to detonatespontaneously shortly after being dropped.For the first time mines have been laid by enemy aircraft in Scapa Flow.Mines were dropped there early in the morning of the 26th August, also in WaterSound, and one was dropped on Burray, where it damaged a house. Two mines were exploded by LL sweep in the Flow during the day and a third in the samevicinity on the following day.
Four magnetic mines were seen to drop in Fishguard Harbour, and the area in which they fell has been declared dangerous. Thirteen magnetic mines andthree moored       s have been swept during the week.Economic Warfare.15. It is reported that the German Government have refused an application made by the Greek Minister at Berlin for the release of Greek ships lying atAntwerp, and it is known that the Greek S.S. Thermaikos (4,518 tons) has nowbeen seized in that port.The seizure of several Swedish ships by the German authorities is now reported. The S.S. Bohus (1,761 tons), bound for Glasgow with paper pulp,boards and lime, and the S.S. Start (1,765 tons), bound for London with chemicalpaper pulp, have both been confiscated with their cargoes by the Hamburg prize court, and. the S.S. Sandar (1,135 tons) and the S.S. Indus (729 tons) were seizedin prize on the 10th May and the 28th May respectively. A report from Helsing-borg states that the S.S. Eros (2,151 tons), which anchored in Bergen Roads on her way from Narvik to Preston in April, was also captured, and in May theS.S. Tyra Bratt (1,301 tons) and the S.S. Framnas (721 tons) were declaredseized at Stavenger after the masters and crews had protested against proceeding to Germany in convoy. Stockholm has reported the seizure of a further 7 ships totalling 10,264 tons.The Greek S.S. A ttiki (2,561 tons) arrived at the piraeus on the 20th August.The master stated that his ship had been stopped by an Italian warship and taken to Palermo, where the authorities had seized 2,100 tons of steel andglycerine and large quantities of sugar which had all been loaded at Lisbon anddestined for Greece.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.Distribution of German Divisions.16. No major change is believed to have taken place in the distribution ofGerman divisions since the report in Resume No. 50. One motorised division hasbeen identified at its peace station on the Baltic, and one armoured division from central Germany has been located on the San sector of the Russian frontier, theirplaces being taken by infantry divisions.Italy and Italian Possessions.17. Italian forces of sufficient strength to assume offensive operations arenow concentrated in the following areas: Italo-Yugoslav frontier, graeco-Albanian frontier, eastern frontier of Libya, and on the Sudan frontier of italian east Africa. There has also been an unconfirmed report of troop concentrationsopposite the Italo-Swiss frontier. As Italy&apos;s aim will be to afford the maximumembarrassment possible to our forces, it seems likely that a carefully co-ordinatedoffensive may begin from Libya, Italian East Africa and Albania, with apossibility of Switzerland being taken under Italian protection at the same time.18. An isolated report from Leros of troop embarkation in the DodecaneseIslands has not been confirmed. In view, however, of the proximity of the dodecanese to Crete and other Greek islands, it is possible that the Italians mayhave been carrying out practice embarkations with a view to stimulating Greekfears. The present garrison of the Dodecanese islands is estimated at45,000-50,000 personnel.The Balkan States.Roumania.19. There are unconfirmed reports that two divisions have been moved fromthe Dobruja to the Hungarian frontier. As agreement appears to have beenreached with Bulgaria on all major points in connexion with Southern Dobruja,
it is probable that their relations are now on a sufficiently amicable basis to allowRoumanian troops to be transferred from the Dobruja to face the danger of aHungarian attack to regain Transylvania.Hungary.20. The Hungarian army remains mobilized. During the past week intensemilitary activity in Budapest and some movement towards the eastern frontierhas been reported.Greece.21. Although early last week the President of the Council stated thatmobilization would not be ordered for fear of provoking Italy, it has since beenreported that ten classes of reservists, as well as certain specialists, have been called up secretly in Epirus and Macedonia. Demolitions have also been prepared on roads in the frontier area, and anti-aircraft measures have been put into effect in the Salonika region. In Crete the troops have been ordered to stand by.The garrison there is not yet fully mobilized, but the Greek General Staff do not anticipate any difficulty in completing mobilisation in sufficient time to meet apossible attack.Iceland.22. The following units have sailed for Iceland from the UnitedKingdom : One General Construction Company.One Docks Operating Company.One Sub-Section Field Bakery.Faroes.23. Two of the 5-5-inch Coast Defence guns being installed are now inaction.West Africa.Sierra Leone.24. The first contingent of the British Brigade Group being sent asreinforcements to the garrison of Freetown has arrived. It comprises one infantry Battalion, one Field Company, R.E., and one Field Ambulance.Gold Coast.25. Further troops of French Senegalese now in the Gold Coast have decidedthat they no longer wish to serve, and of this force only some 135 Europeans and100 Africans remain available.Aden.26. A battalion of the Black Watch embarked at Aden for Egypt on the23rd August, and a Battalion of the Mahratta Light Infantry for the Sudan onthe 25th August.Far East.27. The withdrawal of our garrisons from North China has been completedwith the exception of small rear parties.AIR SITUATION.General Review.2.8. Our bombing operations against Germany continue to combine thereduction of Germany&apos;s air striking power with the offensive against her economic and industrial life. Enemy operational aerodromes, especially inFrance, have been constantly harassed by night and by day whenever weather conditions permitted. In Germany airframe and accessory factories, aero-engineworks, oil plants and electric power installations have been the main objectives,and systematic attacks have been maintained against communications between
the industrial centres and forward operational bases. Considerable success hasbeen reported. Bomber command have also attacked dockyards at Kiel andWilhelmshaven, and on three nights factories in Northern Italy. Coastal and north Sea operations have again been of a normal character. Fighter Commandhave been continuously engaged, but have not inflicted such heavy casualties as last week/owing to the reduction of enemy attacks by day.29. Enemy attacks have been maintained, but operations by short-rangeaircraft are being replaced by long-range bombers operating increasingly at night. German attacks have been principally directed against our aerodromesby day and against industrial targets at night. Considerable damage has beeninflicted, but no very important successes gained. German coastal and transportoperations have been normal.30. A squadron of Royal Air Force medium bombers has arrived in Icelandand a number of Hurricanes in Malta. The Middle East air reinforcement route from Takoradi, in the Gold Coast, via Nigeria and the Sudan, is ready for use.Great Britain.31. Enemy tactics have undergone a considerable change. No short-rangedive-bombers were seen, while last week 83 were destroyed; even the Ju. 88 hasnot been used for dive-bombing. The long-range bomber force is beingincreasingly employed and night attacks have been intensified. The raids were mainly directed against aerodromes and ports, while industrial plants and theaircraft industry also received considerable attention. Other raids were carriedout against aerodromes and oil storage, and a considerable amount of indis-criminate bombing was included in the operations. The heaviest daylight attacksof the week were made on Portsmouth and Ramsgate. At night industrial areasin the Midlands were the principal objectives, though aircraft have flown overLondon on several nights and bombs were dropped in the City and suburbs.32. enemy aircraft engaged in daylight operations have varied between200 and 500 each day, except on the 23rd and 27th August, when activity was limited to reconnaissance flights and to a few individual attacks,involving not more than seventy-five aircraft. The heaviest attacks have developed from the south-east, and large formations of bombers escorted by fighters have been intercepted and dispersed by our fighters. Our fighter aero-dromes seem to have been the principal objectives, but damage was relatively small in view of the threatened weight of the attacks.33. Portsmouth was heavily attacked on the 24th August. During anattack aimed at Warmwell Aerodrome, in Dorset, on the following day, little damage was caused and forty of the aircraft involved were destroyed by our fighters. Machine-gun and bombing attacks have been made by singlereconnaissance aircraft on wireless stations at Daventry, Leafield, and in theScilly Isles, and on a number of inland aerodromes and coastal towns, but no damage of importance has resulted.34. Night attacks have been mainly concentrated on industrial targets inthe Bristol, Birmingham, Coventry and Middlesbrough areas, though high-explosive and incendiary bombs have been dropped, often apparently at random,in all districts of England and Wales. The London district was raided duringseveral nights of the current week, but the attacks appear to have been aimlessand only on the night of the 24th-25th August was any serious damage caused.On most nights between two and three hundred aircraft were involved.35. Fighter Command flew 1,196 patrols involving 4,433 sorties during theweek and not only inflicted very heavy casualties on the enemy but frequentlydispersed or turned back his formations and rendered most of his daylight attacks abortive.  Details of casualties are given in Appendix V.Enemy Territory in Europe.36. Bomber Command flew 133 day and 696 night sorties during the week.Weather conditions limited the success of day operations, but fifteen enemy aerodromes and a number of other military objectives were attacked. Longernights have extended the range of night bombing operations which have followed the same lines as last week and included for the first time attacks on industrial[21689] c
targets on the outskirts of Berlin. Oil depots at Ambes and Pauillac, nearBordeaux, and at Cherbourg have again been successfully attacked, and mine-laying aircraft, after completing their primary tasks, have bombed aerodromes and military targets in North-Western France. Attacks on industrial targets inNorthern Italy have been continued. Medium bombers made more than ninetynight attacks on aerodromes in France, Belgium, and Holland and though the damage is difficult to assess, the fires and heavy explosions which were observedpoint to considerable destruction of hangars, fuel and explosives.37. Though weather conditions were often unsatisfactory, attacks by heavy bombers were continued against aircraft factories, oil plants, munition works,power stations and railway targets. On the night of the 27th-28th August nineWellingtons, though unable to locate the Gneisenau at Kiel, scored many hits inthe dockyard and started a number of fires. Airframe factories at Frankfort,Leipzig and Augsburg, the Henschel works at Johannisthal, near Berlin, theJunkers works at Dessau, the Daimler-Benz works at Stuttgart and the Siemensfactory at Berlin were located and attacked with every indication of success. a heavy attack was directed on the Leuna synthetic oil plant on the26th-27th August by seven aircraft and lighter attacks were made on similarplants at Bottrop, Dortmund, Reisholz and Sterkrade-Holten. Power stations at Cologne and Klingenberg, near Berlin, and a transformer station nearFrankfort were bombed, and reports indicate that the latter has been destroyed.Chemical and explosive factories at Ludwigshaven, Griesheim, Hoechst andCologne, and six of the principal marshalling yards were also attacked duringthe week.38. In Italy, three attacks have been made on the Marelli aircraft accessoryfactory near Milan and two on the Fiat works at Turin. Severe damage appearsto have been caused to both these targets. A single aircraft also attacked theAlta works at Sesto Calende causing explosions and an outbreak of fire.North Sea and Coastal.39. During the week 595 sorties and 142 convoy escorts were flown by coastal command. Operations have been mainly of a routine nature, and daily patrolshave covered North Sea and Scottish waters. Photographic reconnaissances have extended from Southern Norway to the Gironde. On the 26th August aSunderland attacked eight enemy seaplanes at anchor in Tromso harbour,destroying three and damaging the remainder. Aircraft of Coastal Commandhave taken part in minelaying and night bombing attacks in conjunction withthose of Bomber Command. A successful attack was delivered on the 28th Augustby nine Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm on oil cisterns near Bergen. An enemy patrolvessel was set on fire and a merchant ship received a direct hit.40. Aircraft from all German bomber-reconnaissance units have been very active throughout the week, searching for shipping and inspecting objectives bothbefore and after attack. The long-range unit at Bordeaux has operated each day and has made flights on occasion as far as a point 550 miles west of Lisbon.Enemy minelaying aircraft have been active in the usual areas, and there are indications that an increasing number of units is being employed.Middle East and Mediterranean.Malta.41. Enemy air attacks on Malta have become less frequent since the arrival of a squadron of Hurricanes. On the 24th August six bombers escorted bysixteen fighters attacked the aerodromes at Hal Far and Kalafrana, but little damage was done. Four Hurricanes intercepted this raid and shot down one ofthe fighters. A successful reconnaissance was carried out by a Latecotere aircraft with a French crew.Palestine.42. On the 27th August ten Italian bombers carried out a high-level attackon the oil refineries and rail-way yards at Haifa. A hundred bombs were dropped,but apart from one oil storage cistern holed, damage was negligible. There werefourteen minor casualties to civilians.
Egypt and Libya.43. Day and night bombing attacks have been maintained against Italiannaval and air bases in Libya. Objectives attacked during the week includeBomba, Tobruk, Bardia and Derna. Daylight attacks on Derna on the 22nd and27th August by a total of twenty-five Blenheims were covered by a fighter escort,and all our aircraft returned safely. The jetty was hit and fires were started in two ships. The aerodrome at El Adem was twice attacked and damageinflicted on hangars and aircraft. Reconnaissances have been maintained overthe Western Desert and along the coast as far as Benghazi. A Sunderlandflying boat on patrol off North-East Crete was detained by the Greeks after aforced landing.44. Alexandria was raided twice during the week with little damage andfew casualties. On the 28th August enemy aircraft dropped bombs in LakeMariut, where minor damage resulted, and later flew over Port Said but droppedno bombs.Sudan and East Africa.45. Attacks on Italian frontier posts and on enemy-occupied islands in theRed Sea off Massawa were carried out by bombers from the Sudan. Accurateanti-aircraft fire was encountered during a low-level attack by five Wellesleyson hangars at Asmara on the 25th August and one of our aircraft is missing.Omdurman and Khartoum have been bombed by the enemy without serious damage or casualties.46. Successful attacks by bombers based on Aden were made on enemy motor transport parks at Dessie on the 24th and 27th August, and at Harar on the27th August. Attacks were also made on troop concentrations at Berbera and elsewhere in Somaliland. On several days standing fighter patrols were main-tained over Aden and Perim.47. Aircraft of the South African Air Force and Royal Air Force have maintained reconnaissances along the northern and eastern frontiers of Kenya,and have bombed wells and enemy positions on the northern frontier. Fires were caused among fuel cisterns and store houses at Mogadiscio as a result of abombing attack by four Battles on the 24th August.Air Intelligence.Italy.48. Heavy Italian concentrations of aircraft reported at Brindisi and at other aerodromes facing the Greek coast have not so far been confirmed. It ispossible that the Italian authorities are deliberately spreading rumours of this nature in order to intimidate Greece. Unconfirmed reports state that italian aircraft have been carrying out reconnaissance flights over Greek territory.49. Anti-aircraft guns at Rome and coast defence batteries near Genoa arenow said to be manned by German personnel.50. It is reported that an Italian mission is at Casablanca (French Morocco),supervising the erection of a number of American aircraft recently delivered tothe French.51. Reports from various sources indicate that air defences in the WesternSector of Libya are being strengthened by the transfer of fighter aircraft fromthe Eastern Sector, and also by reinforcements from Italy. These movements maybe actuated by Italian anticipation of an increase in the range of Royal Air Forceoperations in the near future.52.. There are further indications of the serious shortage of fighters in italian East Africa. A OR. 42 fighter has recently been transported to Asmarain a transport aircraft.Greece.53. An Italian civil aircraft carrying uniformed soldiers forced-landedrecently at Eleusis.   After repairs had been carried out the Greek Government
allowed it to proceed to Rhodes, rather than risk an incident in view of the tensionexisting with Italy.Spain.54. It is reported that in response to the Spanish Air Staffs request for thesupply of 500 aircraft and material, the Spanish Air Mission visiting Berlin last july was informed that such supplies would depend on Spain&apos;s attitude to thewar. If Spain were involved on Germany&apos;s side, these aircraft would immediately be provided. Otherwise, Germany could only supply against guaranteed &quot; com-pensation payments,&quot; with deliveries spread over a period.Finland.55. It has now been officially stated in Sweden that no Messerschmittaircraft have passed through Sweden, but that a number of training aircraftpurchased by Finland from Germany had proceeded by this route.U.S.A.56. At a recent meeting of the National Advisory Defence Commission thefollowing estimate of U.S. aircraft production for August 1940 was given : For U.S. Army and Navy...........      - - - 396For Royal Air Force       ......       ......... 236For other foreign Governments ...       ......... 84For commercial transport companies (Douglas DC-3type)    ...............      ...... 174Total      .................. 890This estimate, checked with all other available information, appears to be areasonable one, although the figure of 174 transport aircraft is surprisinglylarge.  This figure, however, includes cargo aircraft for the Army and Navy.Syria.57. The French Air Force in Syria, consisting of two fighter squadrons,two bomber squadrons and seven reconnaissance and army co-operationsquadrons, is now reliably reported to have been immobilised on the order ofthe local French military authority, presumably instructed by Vichy to take this precautionary step. Engines have been removed from bombers,reconnaissance and army co-operation aircraft, and magnetos from fighter aircraft.China and Japan.58. A press report from Chungking gives brief details of heavy bombing raids on Chungking and Chengtu on the 20th August. According to this report,details of the bombing at Chengtu are not available, but at Chungking morethan 100 bombers carried out one of the most destructive raids that Chungkinghas experienced.59. Evidence of the training of Japanese parachutists continues to accumulate. Training is reported as taking place in Kwangtung Province,Hainan Island and Formosa. Five deaths and twelve cases of injuries are reported as having occurred in fifteen days in this form of training in Formosa.HOME  SECURITY  SITUATION.General Review.60. During the period covered by this report there was some recrudescenceof mass-raids by day, though not on the scale of the previous week. Attacks oncivilians appear to have become deliberate, both by bomb and machine-gun. Doverhas been shelled from the French Coast on more than one occasion.61. By night there has been increased activity. Considerable forces of enemy aircraft operating in small numbers or singly have carried out widespreadattacks, apparently aimed mainly at industry and communications. The Londonand Birmingham areas have been consistently visited.
Damage.Industry.82. (a) Serious damage was done to the Bristol Aeroplane Works at Filton,and at two B.S.A. factories and a foundry in Birmingham, where other factoriesalso suffered minor damage and a food-store was destroyed.(b) Some damage was done at the West India and Millwall Docks, where aconsiderable quantity of sugar was destroyed.(c) Damage to houses and shops in some districts has been severe,particularly in Ramsgate and Portsmouth.Road and Rail Communications.63. Communications have been interrupted, though not extensively. Theseinterruptions have been largely due to unexploded bombs.Civilian Casualties.64. The following are the approximate civilian casualties during theweek :-- Seriously       slightly killed. Injured.        Injured.By Day...... 167 313 119By Night       ...       ... 129 222 225Of these, more than 80 were killed and 191 injured in the daylight raid onPortsmouth on the 24th August, and 25 killed and 35 seriously injured atRamsgate on the same day. During the week 10 people have been killed and66 seriously injured in London, and 33 killed and 101 seriously injured in birmingham.Civil Defence Services.65. The largest Civil Defence operation of the war has been the firefightingat Llanreath (referred to in Naval Situation). This has been complicated by thetide, by change of wind, and further air attacks by the enemy, including machine-gunning of personnel. Reinforcements have been sent from two neighbouringregions, and five members of the fire services have been killed in this operation.In other areas the Civil Defence Services have been in action on a larger scale than hitherto, and in several cases have been subjected to machine-gun fire from aircraft.[21689]D

APPENDIX VI.Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.THE following reports of damage have been received during the past week from intelligence sources and air reconnaissance : Germany.Hamburg.--The free port area has suffered the most damage. The quaysbordering on the Hansa Hafen and India Hafen have been so damaged as torender them unusable, and the new Neue Elbbrucke has been damaged. TheHamburg Maschinenbau Werke and another factory producing high-grade steel and alloys have been damaged. There is said to have been a strike at Messrs.Blom &amp; Voss owing to the damage and casualties caused by raids.Mannheim. Heidrich Lanz, probably the largest manufacturers ofagricultural machinery in Germany, have failed to fulfil orders owing to damage to their factory.Rheinfelclen. The aluminium works have been hit and severely damaged.The damage to the warehouses can be seen from the Swiss frontier.Bremen. A tanker of 8,500 tons was kept waiting for two days to loadand then routed to another port as damage had rendered loading of the cargoimpossible.  A factory adjacent to the Vulcan yard has been damaged.Jena. The Zeiss Werke has been hit and the whole neighbourhood ringedoff since the attack.General. Dislocation has been caused at the Junkers works at Dessau andthe Dornier works at Wismar.France.Blaye. Six medium oil cisterns have been destroyed.Pauillac. The refinery has been considerably damaged and the fire was still burning when photographed.Norway.One large company has lost over 7,000 tons of oil, and 5,247 tons of Diesel oilwere lost from a ship which it is thought was sunk by air action.Italy.A confirmed report states that the Italians admit the following casualtiesas a result of the raids carried out on the 13th/14th and 15th/16th August:Milan, 12 killed, 50 wounded; Turin, 1 killed, 7 wounded; Alessandria, 12 killed,6 wounded.It is reported that bombs were dropped at Tortona (50 miles North ofGenoa), which caused very heavy damage.It is reported from Roumanian sources that during the raid on Milan onthe night 13th/14th August, the Fiat factory was severely damaged; the auto-testing track on the roof of the factory was hit.According to Swiss sources, the raids have also resulted in heavy damage to the new central station at Milan. A Roumanian pilot, who was in Milan onthe 18th August, states that a hit was obtained on a serviceing petrol cistern, andthat the control tower was badly shaken. The aerodrome, incidentally, isprotected only by machine-gun posts,, and it is said that the crew of at least oneof them fled to shelter when the first bomb burst.The raids have made a deep impression on the Italian people, and theirmorale has suffered in consequence. A neutral observer is of the opinion thata continuation of the raids would soon disorganise normal activities. In some quarters, however, there is a strong demand for retaliation, and it is rumouredthat a large raid on Alexandria will be staged.
