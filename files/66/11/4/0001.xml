THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet. August 1940.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 324.August 21, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.GOLD AND EXCHANGE RESOURCES.Summary of Position.I am seriously perturbed by the rate at which our gold and exchange resources are now disappearing.This is a brief summary of the position, including certain recommenda-tions, but members of the War Cabinet will no doubt read the longer note and appendix which set out the matter more explicitly.At the 1st January, 1940, our total resources, i.e., gold (includingbalances) and United States securities, were about  775 millions, a figure which by mid-August has shrunk to  490 millions.The collapse of France greatly changed the situation, particularly bythe assignment to ourselves of French contracts with American manufacturers foraeroplanes, &amp;c. The position at the end of June was that we might have expectedto lose, as a minimum,  410 millions of gold and exchange before June 1941.Since then there have been three developments : (a) Repeat orders for aeroplanes are proposed, costing an additional  50millions before June 1941.(b) The programme for the purchase of munitions and tanks by the BritishPurchasing Commission costing some  60 millions before that date,apart from projected additions which may run to high figures.(c) A further projected scheme for the large scale purchase of aeroplanes inthe United States, which might also involve many tens of millions bythat date.Unless these schemes, when formulated, assume less formidable dimensionsduring the period in question than at present appears likely, the adverse balance of the year to June 1941 might grow from  410 millions to a figure inthe region of  800 millions.There has also recently been a sharp increase in the rate of loss of our gold and dollar reserve, which fell in July from about  380 millions to about  320millions. There has been a further loss of  28 millions in the first two weeks ofAugust. Our holdings of United States securities now stand at about  200millions, but they are almost unsaleable at present, and at any time can onlygradually be realised.American financial help will not be made without conditions and withoutlimit, and it must be assumed that we shall have in any event to provide from our own resources for our adverse balance with Canada and with foreign countries other than the United States.[21655] b
We are faced with the immediate practical problem of holding out tillwell into November in the case of a Democratic victory, or until after the 20thJanuary, when the new President takes office, in the case of a Republican victory.A mere continuance of losses at the rate we have experienced in thelast six weeks would run us out of gold by the end of December. It is also mostimportant, in order to avoid complete financial dependence, that we keep someminimum reserve in hand even after American help has crystallised.Alleviation may be found (a) in a minor degree by &quot; scraping the pot &quot; as set forth in paragraph 17;(b) by augmenting our gold reserve as set forth in paragraph 18, though herethere may be considerable political difficulties, and we cannot count onthis contribution immediately;(c) by the  possibility of  contributions  from  the  Belgian,  Dutch  and norwegian Governments (paragraph 19);(d) by the securing of certain French gold (paragraph 20).But for the next six months at least the exchange position must obviously be treated as a bottle neck and dollar expenditure must be watched by the treasury in conjunction with the Departments concerned, so as to limit it to vital needs,including vital munitions of war for delivery not too far ahead. Dollar expendi-ture for political and pre-emptive purposes and on schemes for acquiring worldsurpluses must also be carefully controlled.(Initialled) K. W.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,August 21, 1940.Gold and Exchange Resources.Note (amplifying the Summary).I. The War Chest: Initial Position.1. American armaments and many other vital imports into this countryand other parts of the Sterling Area mean loss of gold or foreign exchange; thereasons are shown in the Appendix. The gold and exchange resources withwhich we started the war are being rapidly used up.2. At the outbreak of war our holding of gold and dollars was roughly 450 million. We requisitioned from residents in this country their balances of useful foreign currencies and obtained returns of their foreign securities,with a view to their subsequent requisition. These returns disclosed Americansecurities readily marketable in the United States to an amount of about 275 million. Some of the holders of these securities proceeded, with theapproval of the authorities, to sell them for dollars, which were surrendered tothe Government. Owing partly to this, partly to the requisitioning of dollarbalances, and partly to Canadian help, the gold and dollar holding rose in theearly months of the war, touching its highest point at the end of November at about  530 million. At the 1st January, 1940, our total resources, gold, balancesand securities, were about  775 million (gold  m. 525 and securities  m. 250), a figure which by mid-August has shrunk to  490 million (gold  m. 290, securities m. 200).3. The total holdings of overseas securities by British residents are large,perhaps of the order of  3,500 million in face value. It is sometimes suggestedthat these should be realised for dollars or gold. The great bulk of them, however.,are sterling investments in the Empire and, to a lesser extent, in South America.Subiect to some qualifications which, in fact, are of minor importance, nOne ofthem, except those which from the outset were marked out for registration andeventual requisition, are at all likely to be saleable for gold or dollars. There isno body of residents, in the United States or any other foreign country, both
willing and able to purchase them. Few even of our direct investments in theUnited States, such as the American branches of British companies, are such as could be sold except: with the help of the American Administration. It wouldbe regrettable if it were necessary to throw away to foreign competitors our industrial subsidiaries abroad at disastrous prices.4. As the prospect presented itself in September last, the war chest as above described was extremely meagre for the financing of a long war. Therewas at that time iio reliable prospect of large American credits or gifts. The warchest of the French was also meagre; they held some  800 millions in gold andprobably no very great sum in realisable dollar securities. In these circumstances,it was a primary object of policy in the early months to try to prevent the rapiddissipation of our means of making purchases outside the Steiiing Area.Accordingly, the maintenance of the export trade assumed paramount importance,while imports of superfluities of all kinds were cut down. As regards war supplies, the policy tended towards the import of raw materials to be workedup in this country rather than the purchase of finished goods involving a muchheavier burden for wages and profits to foreigners.II. Consequences of the collapse of France.5. The collapse of France changed the situation. Previously the only bulkorder of first-class magnitude for American armaments had been the Anglo-French order for aeroplanes costing roughly  150 millions. But now the need of this country for American munitions became overmastering. arrangements were made for the assignment to ourselves of French contracts with Americanmanufacturers for aeroplanes, munitions and raw materials totalling some 200 millions; of these, some  60 millions fell due for early payment in dollars to the credit of the &apos;&apos; State of France &apos;&apos; in reimbursement for out payments already made by the French. Allowing for our obligations under these French contracts,the position at the end of June (when our gold and balances, apart fromsecurities, stood at about  m. 380), would appear to be that we might expect to lose, as a minimum,  410 millions of gold and exchange before June 1941. this of course is an aggregate net figure taking account of all our needs, includingessential food and raw materials.6.   Since then there have been three developments (a) Repeat orders for aeroplanes in the United States are proposed, costingan addition of roughly  m. 50 before June 1941.(b) The programme for the purchase of munitions and tanks which theBritish Purchasing Commission in New York has under considera-tion is much greater than was believed at the end of June, and it-may well be that orders already sanctioned actually or in principlefrom this side would carry a further cost of the order of  60 millionsbefore June 1941. Much larger munitions orders which the BritishPurchasing Commission is tentatively exploring might well involve an addition of the order of  150 millions by June 1941, but it isunderstood from figures just received from the Ministry of Supplythat that Department is thinking on a much smaller scale.(c) A further scheme for the purchase of aeroplanes in the United States ona great scale has been indicated. A recent announcement by the Headof the British Purchasing Commission now refers to a schemeinvolving the purchase of 1,250 aeroplanes a month. It is too early to ask the Ministry of Aircraft Production for any real estimate ofthe cost, but it is clear that both the initial cost and also the cost ofthe scheme in full operation must be very heavy. I should expect thelatter to lie in the region of  m. 300 per annum.7. Unless these schemes, when formulated, assume less formidable dimensionsin the period in question than at present appears likely, the adverse balance ofthe year to June 1941 might grow from  m.410 to a figure in the region of m.800. Although the position should shortly become clearer, it would not seempossible in the present stage of development of new schemes to be more precise[21655] B 2
&apos;        III. Recent heavy increase in the rate of loss.8. There has recently been also a sharp increase in the rate of loss of our gold and dollar reserve, which fell in July from about  380 millions to about 320 millions. There has been a further loss of  28 millions in the first two weeks of August. By this time, moreover, as a result partly of sales and partly of loss of market value, our holdings of readily marketable American securitiesstand at about  200 millions. The New York stock market is quite incapable of absorbing more than very small amounts of securities until war and electionuncertainties are cleared up.9. The swiftness and severity of the change exceeded expectation, and,taken in conjunction with the immediate prospects, create new problems of seriouscharacter.TV. Attitude of the American Administration.10. The Secretary of the United States Treasury recently asked for a visitfrom a Treasury official to discuss inter alia the balance of payments with theUnited States. As a result Mr. Morgenthau is under no illusion but that weshall want massive credits in 1941, and that before then we may need helpin liquidating securities. His attention has since been drawn by the FinancialAttache to the rapid increase in our commitments referred to in paragraph 6.11. Mr. Morgenthau made it clear that the Administration would not enterat present into promises or commitments, and it appears certain that no under-taking of any kind could be obtained before the election.12. That United States financial help will be forthcoming, however theelection goes, appears to be the view of our representatives in America, though thetime, extent and character of the help may depend on factors which cannot beforecast, such as the course of the war and the extent to which that body of opinion in America which is strongly opposed to entanglements succeeds in influencing the electoral campaign.13. It appears prima facie unlikely that American financial aid, whenforthcoming, will be given (by a country not at war and to a country in default)without conditions and without limit. How far those conditions or that limitwill interfere with the present tempo of our war effort and how far with ourstandard of life only the future can tell. The United States will no doubtsettle both the extent to which and the conditions under which we can enjoy the products of American industry and agriculture, and in that way may materiallyinfluence the character of the war. We may well assume that we shall be leftanyhow to provide from our own resources for our adverse balance with canada and foreign countries other than the United States. That will be a most difficult task, and quite impossible if we fail to obtain the current output of newly-minedgold from South Africa. How far does the willingness of South Africa to sellus her gold output for sterling, and the willingness of the other members of the sterling area to add without limit to their sterling balances in London, dependon the assumption that London remains what she sets out to be, the central safe-keeper of the Empire&apos;s gold? Can we be certain that these convenient habitsand practices would remain unchanged if London had once parted, or was on theverge of parting, with its last grain of gold to the United States ? It has beeneasy for Hitler to persuade Germany, which never had much gold, that gold is auseless complication of the course of international trade, desired as an end only by the decadent pluto-democracies. It would not be so easy for us to put a similaridea across other countries, some of which are professional gold producers, and toall of which gold is an accepted medium. Moreover, it is essential that we should maintain confidence in our ability to fulfil engagements to other countries under&quot; payments agreements &quot; and the like; if we do not possess gold reserves, wecannot expect such countries as the Argentine to accept and hold sterling.V. Problem of the Interval pending American help.14. Meanwhile, we are faced with an immediate and grave practicalproblem : are we certain to hold out financially till after the election, i.e., tillwell into November in the case of a Democratic victory, or until the 20th January,
when the new President takes office, in the case of a Republican victory ? Atthe end of June it appeared probable that we could, but the position is now very doubtful. We expected to lose some  460 millions, including the repeat ordersfor aircraft, in the year from the 1st July, 1940, to the 30th June, 1941, but wehave actually lost some  88 millions in the first six weeks, and the increased losses in respect of additional munitions, tanks and aircraft plans may carry the totalto some  800 millions in the period to June 1941, quite a substantial part ofthe additional loss coming before January. A mere continuance of losses at therate we have experienced in the last six weeks would run us out of gold by theend of December. It is not safe to reckon on a slower rate of loss, and unlesssteps are taken it may prove higher. Moreover, to avoid complete financialdependence, it is most important that we keep some minimum reserve in handeven after A merican help has crystallised. When denuded of gold, our resources would be some  200 millions of securities, which are at present and may thenbe unsaleable in quantity.15. As regards this problem, the decisive factors are the sums we have toprovide in the next six months for new capital construction and for downpayments in placing orders. The British Purchasing Commission has been successful hitherto in limiting down payments to a figure which, though onerous,is not impossibly high. On the other hand, we found, when we took over theFrench contracts, that American manufacturers had demanded and obtained fromthe French far and away heavier advances. Our position would be terriblycomplicated if, on placing new programmes in the next few months, we were facedwith much worse terms in this respect than on our own recent contracts. Americanmanufacturers know fairly well what our resources were at the outbreak of war,as estimates were published by the Federal Reserve Board and received much attention; they know also that those resources are much lower now and may be inadequate to meet the liabilities we are undertaking.VI. Possible alleviations of the problem.16. It remains to consider whether alleviation may be looked for in anydirections.17. &quot; Scraping the pot &quot; for more resources will not produce much.Possibilities are the requisition of gold ornaments and of works of art that couldbe.sold abroad. The disposal of some direct investments in the United States maybe considered, and also the possibility of selling some of our South Americaninvestments to that country. But the equities of these investments stand in great part at rubbish prices, and generally what we can sell is sold more profitably tothe South American countries themselves, though even then on bad enough terms.Finally, the question of pushing exports to North America, so far as anti-dumpingrestrictions permit, is receiving attention. We should be deluding ourselves if we thought that these measures could in all produce more than a few millions this year.18. Secondly, we must consider whether there is any other source from which our gold reserves could be augmented in the immediate future. Importantquantities of gold, amounting at present prices to about  64 millions and  70millions respectively, are owned by the Reserve Banks of India and South Africa.From the point of view of the American Administration there may seem to be little difference between this gold and that in the possession of the United KingdomGovernment. But the internal mechanics of the sterling area are a delicate affair.While the matter has not yet been fully explored, it seems likely that an attemptto secure possession of the Indian and South African monetary gold reserves would be attended by grave political difficulty. In any case it seems clear thatwe cannot count on it as a contribution to the immediate problem of tiding overtill America is ready to lend.19. Thirdly, the Belgian, Dutch and Norwegian Governments all holdsubstantial amounts of gold, believed to amount to  m. 200,  m. 150 and  m. 20respectively. They must be pressed for substantial contributions, but will be very reluctant to part with any.
20. Of much more importance from that point of view is the position ofcertain French gold. Much of their original store was spent before, the collapse.About . m. 126 is understood to be in New York; about  m. 130 may be.,at dakar. At the time of the collapse a French warship put into Halifax carrying a cargo of French gold which may have been worth some  60 millions. Thisescaped our clutches and is now at Martinique. Beyond this there is, however,the  160 millions of French gold in Canada ( 70 millions in the custody of theBank of England and  90 millions in the custody of the Bank of Canada). Inaddition, as already related, we are paying to the French some  60 millions in dollars in connection with the assignment to us of their American contracts; thispayment is being made to an account of the Bank of Canada with the FederalEeserve Bank of New York. If France had survived, these gold and dollar reserves would be part of the allied war chest; if those last mentioned, amountingto  220 millions, could now be secured for the prosecution of the war on whichthe future of the French nation depends, the immediate situation would be greatlyalleviated.21. Each of the foregoing expedients by which our reserves might befortified will be made the subject of such action as may be possible. Action hasalready been started in regard to the French gold and dollars held by Canada.Nevertheless, save in the case of the  70 millions of French gold entrusted to theBank of England, any early fruitful result is at best extremely uncertain.VII.  Vital importance of American help.22. This note has, of course, been written on the assumption that theconfident expectation of abundant American help will not be falsified. Werehelp in the end refused, we should be cast back far more fully than ever beforeupon the sole resources and capacities of our own race. To exhaust our gold reserves in payments on account for American armaments in the meantime wouldbe a grave calamity, for we cannot survive without raw materials and food from overseas. The chance of help being withheld, entirely remote as it may seem,lends high importance to the preservation of some reasonable balance of exchangereserves.VIII. General recommendations.(i) For the next six months at least the exchange position must be treated as abottle-neck and dollar expenditure watched by the Treasury in conjunction withthe Departments concerned so as to limit it to vital needs, including vitalmunitions of war for delivery not too far ahead. The greater ease in the shipping position should be used to bring goods from more distant sterling parts of theCommonwealth rather than America. All possible means of fostering the exporttrade, especially to North America, should be pursued.(ii) Dollar expenditure for political and pre-emptive purposes and onschemes for acquiring world surpluses must be carefully controlled.(iii) The alleviations above referred to must each be examined and pursuedwith a view to securing whatever help is possible before a dangerous situationmatures.
APPENDIX.THE Sterling Area consists of the United Kingdom; the Dominions withthe exception of Canada and Newfoundland; India and Burma; nearly all theBritish Colonies, Dependencies and Mandated Territories; and Egypt, Sudanand Iraq. When we buy from or sell to a country inside this wide area the billis settled in sterling. But when we or any other country inside the area buy froma country outside the area, the excess of purchases over sales must be made goodin gold or foreign exchange. It is only to a limited extent and under special arrangements that foreign countries will accept sterling in payment. In thenormal case we must pay gold or dollars; the whole of our vast purchases in north America are made in that form.2. Canada is not a member of the Sterling Area and payment must be madein gold or dollars to her as to the United States. The difference between canada and. the United States is that to the extent to which her resources permit (sheherself has a large and growing adverse balance with the United States) shecontributes towards part of our expenditure.3. If a country inside the area, say New Zealand or the Malay States, buysfrom the United States, it is the British Exchange Control which finds the dollars;and, per contra, if they sell their goods to the United States, it is the BritishExchange Control which receives the dollar proceeds. It will be seen that any failure by a country of the sterling area to restrict unnecessary imports from foreign countries affects our reserves just as though the failure had been on ourown part.4. The British Exchange Control thus bears in effect the adverse balanceof the whole Sterling Area. Towards meeting that burden there are certaincurrent receipts of which account has been taken in the Note, viz. : (1) Sales ofnewly-mined gold by the Sterling Area to the outside world running at about 110 millions a year; (2) the financial assistance we get from Canada (includingthe sale to Canadians of Canadian securities held here) of the order of  50 or 60 millions a year. Such current receipts are totally insufficient to meetthe drain.
