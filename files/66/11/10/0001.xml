THIS document is the property of HIS britannic majesty&apos;3 governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet. August 1940.SECRET Copy No. 21TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.GENERAL DIRECTIVE EOR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,MIDDLE EAST.THE following General Directive for Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,has been drawn up by the Minister of Defence in consultation with the Chiefs ofStaff, on which your observations are requested : 1. A major invasion of Egypt from Libya must be expected at any time now.It is necessary, therefore, to assemble and deploy the largest possible army uponand towards the western frontier. All political and administrative considerationsmust be set in proper subordination to this.2. The evacuation of Somaliland is enforced upon us by the enemy, but isnone the less strategically convenient. All forces in or assigned to Somalilandshould be sent to Aden, to the Sudan via Port Sudan, or to Egypt, as may bethought best.  East Africans may go to Kenya, if desired.3. The defence of Kenya must rank after the defence of the Sudan. Thereshould be time after the crisis in Egypt and the Sudan is passed to reinforceKenya by sea and rail before any large Italian expedition can reach the Tanariver. We can always reinforce Kenya faster than Italy can pass large forcesthither from Abyssinia or Italian Somaliland. It is not necessary to hold thefrontier and you may be able to achieve economy of force by surrendering thedesert areas to the enemy and holding the line of the Tana river with a suitableextension to cover essential communications in the gap between Garissa and LakeRudolph. It is hoped to send to Kenya in the near future some A.F.V.&apos;s and anti-tank guns in order to compel the enemy to advance with heavy infantryforces.4. Accordingly, if this can be done without endangering Nairobi andthe railway, either the two West African Brigades or two Brigades of the k.A.R. should be moved forthwith to Khartoum. General Smuts is being asked to allow the Union Brigade, or a large part of it, to move to the Canal zone and the Delta for internal security purposes. Arrangements should be made tocontinue their training. The Admiralty are being asked to report on shippingpossibilities in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea.5. The two Brigades, one of Regulars and the other Australian, which are held ready in Palestine, should now move into the Delta in order to clear thePalestine communications for the movement of further reserves as soon as theycan be equipped for field service or organised for internal security duties.6. The rest of the Australians, numbering six battalions, in Palestine will thus be available at five days&apos; notice to move into the Delta for internal security orother emergency employment.[21669] B
7. However, immediately three or four Regiments of British Cavalry,without their horses, should, it would seem, take over the necessary duties in the canal Zone, liberating the three Regular battalions there for general reserve ofthe field army of the Delta.8. The Polish Brigade should move to the Delta from Palestine as may be convenient and join the general reserve, which already includes the FrenchVolunteer unit.9. The movement of the Indian Division and the three Batteries of BritishArtillery, although horse-drawn, now embarking or in transit are beingaccelerated to the utmost.10.   Most of the above movements should be completed before the 1stOctober, and on this basis the army of the Delta should comprise: (a) The British Armoured Force in Egypt.(&amp;) The Five British battalions at Mersa Matruh, the two at Alexandria andthe two in Cairo total nine.(c) The three Battalions from the Canal zone.\d) The reserve British Brigade from Palestine total fifteen British RegularInfantry Battalions.(e) The New Zealand Brigade.(/) The Australian Brigade from Palestine.(g) The Polish Brigade and French Volunteer Unit.(h) Part of the Union Brigade from East Africa.(i) The Fourth Indian Division now in rear of Mersa Matruh (less oneBrigade).(j) The new Indian Division, less one brigade, in transit.\k) The 11,000 men in drafts arriving almost at once at Suez, and additional13,700 details arriving about the 15th September.(I) All the artillery (212 guns) (including from India) now in the middle east or en route from India.(m) The Egyptian army so far as it can be used for field operations.11. The above should constitute by the 1st October at the latest a forceof 39 Battalions together with armoured forces; a total of about 56,000 men and212 guns.   This is exclusive of internal security troops.12. It is hoped that the armoured brigade from England of three Regimentsof tanks will be passed through the Mediterranean by the Admiralty. If this isimpossible their arrival round the Cape may be counted upon by the3rd October. The arrival of this force by the earliest possible date must beconsidered so important as to justify a considerable degree of risk in theirtransportation.Tactical employment of the army in Egypt.13. The aim must be to destroy Italian forces in the desert, but as a last resort the line of the Delta must be held at all costs. The Mersa Matruh position must be fortified completely and with the utmost speed. The sector held by thethree Egyptian battalions must be taken over by three British battalions, makingthe force homogeneous. This must be clone even if the Egyptian government wish to withdraw the artillery now supporting these three battalions. Thepossibility of reinforcing by sea the Mersa Matruh position and cutting enemy communications, if they should have succeeded in passing it by on their march to the Delta, must be studied with the Naval and Air Commanders-in-Chief.Alternatively, a descent upon the communications at Sollum or further west maybe preferred.14. If a retirement should be necessary, no attempt should be made to leavesmall parties to defend the wells near the coast in this region. All water suppliesbetween Mersa Matruh and the Alexandria defences must be rendered depotable(a special note on this is attached).* The road from Sollum to Mersa Matruh,and still more the tarmak road from Mersa Matruh to Alexandria, must be.rendered impassable as and when it is abandoned by (a) delay action mines (seespecial notet); or by chemical treatment of the asphalt surface (see special nbtej).* Annex I.f Annex II.$ Annex III.
15. The final line of defence must be prepared from Alexandria along theedge of the cultivated zone and irrigation canals of the Delta. For this purpose the strongest concrete and sandbag works and pill-boxes should be built orcompleted from the sea to the cultivated zone and the main irrigation canal. Thepipe-line forward of this front should be extended as fast as possible. The Deltazone is the most effective obstacle to tanks of all kinds, and can be lightly held bysandbag works to give protection to Egypt and form a very strong extended flankfor the Alexandria front. A broad strip, four or five miles wide, should iffeasible be inundated from the flood waters of the Nile, controlled at Assouan.Amid or behind this belt a series of strong posts, supported when possible byartillery, should be constructed.16. In this posture then the army of the Delta will finally defeat the Italianinvasion. It must be expected that the enemy will advance in great force, limitedonly, but severely, by the supply of water and petrol. He will certainly havestrong armoured forces, on his right hand to contain and drive back our weakerforces unless these can be reinforced in time by the armoured regiments from great Britain. He may attempt to mask if he cannot storm Mersa Matruh.But, if the main line of the Delta is diligently fortified and resolutely held, hewill be forced to deploy an army whose supply of water, petrol, food andammunition will be difficult. Once the army is deployed and seriously engaged,the action against his communications by bombardment from the sea, by descentat Mersa Matruh, Sollum, or even much further west, would be a deadlyblow to him.17. The campaign for the Defence of Egypt may, therefore, as a last resort,resolve itself into : strong defence with the left arm from A lexandria inland,and a reaching out with the right hand, using sea-power  upon his communications.At a later date it is hoped that the reinforcement of the A.A. defence of malta and its re-occupation by the Fleet will hamper the sending of further reinforce-ments Italian or German from Europe into Africa, and that an air offensivemay ultimately be developed from Malta against Italy.18. All this (except Malta) might be put effectively in train by the1st October, provided we are allowed the time. If not, we must do what we can.All trained or Regular units, whether fully equipped or not, must be used in defence of Egypt against invasion. All armed white men and also Indian or foreign units must be used for internal security. The Egyptian army must bemade to play its part in support of the Delta front, thus leaving only riotouscrowds to be dealt with in Egypt proper.[21669J
Note on Method of Dealing with Drinking Water.Presumably distilling plants or acqueducts, such as exist at Matruh, will beblown up in case of retreat.If the water in tanks cannot be run out or forced out by filling in sand orgravel, the water can be rendered useless by adding a suitable chemical. Ifordinary brine or salt is available 1 per cent, should suffice. Alternatively, smallerquantities of more potent substances can be used.These will be required for wells or sources in which ordinary salt would be quickly dissolved and washed away.Investigations under the auspices of the Chemical Defence Department seemto show that Pyridine Bases, Creostote Oils or if obtainable Bone Oil, would bevery suitable for rendering water non-potable. One part in 4,000 would renderwater too nauseating for human consumption.If poured into a well which filled up by percolation through the bottom, one part in, say, 500 of the daily flow would probably render the well useless for amonth. Though the lighter fractions would soon be washed away, the less solublefraction would seep into the bottom and slowly dissolve as fresh water flowed in.Inquiries about supplies of these substances here and in Egypt are in hand.It may be remarked that none of these substances is toxic in the ordinarysense; indeed, pyridine has long been used as a denaturant to render alcohol(methylated spirits) non-potable for that very reason.ANNEX II.Note on Delay-action Mines.NO fuzes extant are made for a delay of more than a week. - Four hundred ofone such type are on their way out to Egypt in one of H.M. ships.2. Another type, of which there are about 2,000, could probably have itsperiod extended to 18 days and possibly 25 or 30. These were made for theW scheme, so would presumably fit the ordinary aeroplane bomb, of which theremust be a number available in the Near East. It would be important to bury themdeep when a long delay was desired, as the delay will be reduced the higher the temperature.3. It is suggested that the work necessary to extend the period of delay ofthis type should be done, and that a number should be sent out as soon as possibleto Egypt by air.August 16, 1940.ANNEX I.
ANNEX III.Note on Treatment of Asphalt Surface of Road.Egypt.   Western Desert.Proposal to m,ake the Road between Sollum and Mersa Matruh unfit for use with Heavy Oil.ACCORDING to available information, about 80 kilometres of the road between Sollum and Mersa Matruh are surfaced with tarmac. The road isabout 16 feet wide, and can thus take a double line of traffic.2. By applying heavy oil to the surface, it is probable that the bitumenwhich binds the stone would be liquefied, and become sticky; with the resultthat traffic using the road would cause it to tear up, and become impassable.The effect would be very much greater if the surface could first be scarified, soas to allow the oil to penetrate.3. Without an accurate knowledge of local conditions, and some experiment,it is difficult to say how much oil would have to be applied, but a rough estimate is a 50-gallon drum every 30 yards (8 to 10 tons per mile). The figure is expressedthis way, because it is almost certain that few, if any, tank wagons are availablein Egypt.4. Whether this method of putting the road out of action is worth pursuingdepends upon (a) The extent to which the Italians would rely on the road for the successof an advance.(b) The practical possibility of spreading the oil when the moment comes.This can only be judged by the local Commander, but examinationmight show that it would be worth dealing with the road now, andforegoing the use of it for ourselves, in order to ensure that it willnot be available to the Italians.5. It is suggested that this Note might be communicated to General Wavell,so that, if he considered the matter worth pursuing, he could arrange for experi-ments to be carried out on his return to Egypt. Mr. Llewellyn of the shell company in Egypt would be able to advise on the type* of fuel oil to employ,and on other technical details.August 16, 1940.* It is believed that gas-oil would give the best results.
