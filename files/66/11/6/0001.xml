R.A.F. TRAINING.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.ARRANGEMENTS are in hand for the transfer overseas of a number ofair training establishments.2. Reasons for the transfer of these schools are said to be the extension of active flying operations over this country, and consequent restrictions on flying training, including, in particular, night-flying training. An additional reason,given by A.M.T. in his paper dated the 23rd July, 1940, was the need for handing over training stations at home to operational squadrons. The Secretary of Statefor Air states that an additional seven sites are being prepared in Canada as an insurance against further interference with our training here, and in preparation for the transfer of seven schools to Canada.3. It is admitted by both the Secretary of State for Air and A.M.T. thatthese projected transfers of training establishments will cause some dislocationin the output of pilots. A.M.T. says that the gap is estimated to amount to atleast two months&apos; output for a move to Canada, and to two and a half months&apos;output for a move to South Africa. The disadvantages entailed in this drop in output, consequent on the transfer of schools overseas from Britain, might be mitigated by the following measures : (a) As a general rule, we should avoid transferring existing schools in thiscountry overseas if there is any possibility of providing, from overseasresources, the necessary personnel, aircraft, and equipment requiredto form new schools in the Dominions, or possibly in the United States.This should be the guiding principle form new schools overseas,rather than transfer existing ones.(6) We should transfer elementary flying training schools in Britain fromaerodromes which are suitable for service flying training schools to open spaces, such as race courses, &amp;c, and use these aerodromes for service flying training schools. Elementary training schools do not require large aerodromes, runways, extensive accommodation for work-shops and personnel. Many of the aerodromes now used by elementarytraining schools could be handed over to service flying training schools,and the lack of accommodation for new service flying training schools in this country might thus be overcome.(c) We should accept the risk of casualties to training aircraft and pupilscaused by enemy machines in this country. Training should proceed by day, and as far as possible by night, despite this risk. If the enemyemploys his aircraft in attacking training machines, instead of more[21661]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.

important objectives in Britain, he will be wasting his time.Extensive operations against training aircraft are thereforeimprobable.(d) The Air Ministry should be authorised to take over race courses and allopen spaces, which can be utilised for training establishments, withoutpaying any attention to protests raised by the owners or by localauthorities.4. In any case, I reject the estimate of 2 or 2\ months&apos; delay in the outputof pilots. The time lost will be much longer, on account of the task of shipmentand packing involved. A.M.S.O. anticipates a transfer overseas of 2,500 aircraft in the last half of this year. This cannot be done. It would congest the ports and overburden terminal facilities. The attempt to accomplish it would involvea wasteful diversion of labour. And the packing required would be a wilfulsquandering of valuable material.5. The departure of good pilots, now flying instructors here, is a serious consideration. At present, we can call upon these men in emergency to serve thecountry as operational pilots.   They are a valuable reserve.6. Similarly, training machines represent a last reserve of aircraft. If wesend them abroad, we dissipate this reserve. Yet, in the last and decisive hour ofthe battle, they might be precious indeed.7. Any general admission that flying training has become impractical inthis country owing to enemy air activity will create an impression in theU.S.A. and in the Dominions that the scale of enemy air attack on this countryis serious and may be decisive.8. Finally, there have been many rumours concerning evacuation to canadian  the past, and also about Government and other intentions in future. Therehave been suggestions about the Fleet. The departure of a large Air Force, partly to the American continent, would cause a renewal of false rumours in many directions.B.Ministry of Aircraft Production, S.W. 1,August 20, 1940.
