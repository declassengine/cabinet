 I EC -^ijjSi. .S*SOTHJLUGUST. 1940.HOME opinon as SHEWN IN THE MAILS TO U0S.Aa AND EIREU.S.A.,Morale..Civilian morale in this Mail is outstandinglygood.     Complete confidence in ultimate victory and apleasurable anticipation of the excitements that must come first are the key note in almost all letters..Complaints of nerve strain are so few as to healmost negligible, and when they occur most writers areat pains to emphasize that it is only they, individually,who suffer in this way, and that their confidence in the outcome of the war is unaffected.Recent intensification of air-raids seems tohave had a most exhilarating effect on people&apos;s spirits,and the general impression given is that of a large and united family, looking forward to a great adventure, whichthey will go through together.&quot;Now we have got our expeditionary force back .. 8we feel we are sharing the dangers with them, andthere is no one to let us down&quot;.    (l) Oxford.Relief at being freed from foreign commitmentsis reinforced by a natural pride at the thought that this one, small island now faces all comers alone and unaided;and although few writers express themselves as frankly asa Glasgow correspondent;    &quot;We certainly are a wonderfuleople, and pleased to belong to this fine little island&quot;.2)    this feeling is implicit throughout the mail,&quot;Remember, it is a very different proposition whenmen have to defend their own land&quot;.    (3)    London.References to &quot;our own Island&apos;  are startlinglyfrequent.     The value of Slogans as an aid to moraleappears to be considerable:    &apos;Digging for Victory&apos;  and&apos;There&apos;11 always be an England&apos; are constantly quoted, but the phrase &apos;0ur Island Portress&apos; is used more often andwith more gusto than any other.     Writers, for the mostpart9 completely ignore the British Empire as a composite

unit, and there are only hare references to the presenceof colonial troops in this country, or to the help given&quot;by Dominions and. Colonies,,      This would suggest that another and more imperial slogan would he of value j,provided that it caught on.&quot;We are making out grand on our Island Fortress&quot;(h)    Glamorgan,&quot;Twelve o&apos;clock and all&apos;s well will sound againsoon for the island people&quot;.    (5)    Jarrow-onVTyne.It must he admitted that the future of theoppressed nations of Europe does not weigh heavily withcorrespondents, except with a certain, well-defined groupwho look on the present struggle as a fight betweenChristianity and the powers of darkness.     These, without exception, state that we are fighting not for ourselvesalone, but for the freedom of all vanquished peoples;    aridhere again the slogan appears, for almost all refer toNaziism as ^his evil thing&apos;.In spite of complete confidence in ultimatevictory there is no want of appreciation of the natureof the trial that lies before us, and no expectation of aspeedy end to the war.      The businesslike view of aManchester correspondent seems to be fairly general:&quot;The war is proceeding O.K. and we are allhoping to finish it in about 12 months&quot;.    (6)A number of writers frankly admit the thrill theyare experiencing at the present moment,&quot;I would not be anywhere in the world but here,for a fortune. Like is full of adventure..,.It is ail pieasurably exciting and uplifting11&apos;.(7)    N, Wembley.&quot;I would have liked Mother and Auntie to cometo the USS,A, till it was over, but think theyare afraid, of missing the fun here&quot;,    (8)Northwood.Want of holidays is dismissed as a triflingprice to pay for winning the war:&quot;None of us is going away for holidays this year.It does not seem quite the thing to me&quot;.    (9) Isle-  of Man.&quot;Our soldiers and sailors and airmen don&apos;t getmany holidays, so why should we?&quot;  (10) EdgwareMany writers ex-press surprise at the discoveryof how much England means to them;    others are delightedat the spirit of comradeship between all classes, and still others see in tho present struggle the birth of anew world,

&quot;It&apos;s all so extraordinary, too, to find just how much one minds ahout one&apos;s own country&quot;, (11)Taplow, Bucks.&quot;We are all sharing the same anxieties - and this makes such a wonderful &quot;bond &quot;between us all.&quot;(12)   Woodfield, Nr. Ross.&quot;It&apos;s like watching a nation fighting for itslife and being reborn in the process&quot;. (13)Manchester.The following three quotations sum up, in brief,the spirit of the country:&quot;I feel sure that &apos;safety first&apos; is a rottenslogan.      To live dangerously, as we are doing now, warms the blood like a sound ofa trumpet&quot;.    (lh)    Sidmouth.&quot;We have dug down into the roots of this oldcountry and have re-discovered the spirit ofthe old Yeomen&quot;.    (15)    Sleafora. Linos.&quot;YiTe Scots people are ... fighting our own battleand a lot of other people&apos;s too, who are quitewilling to let us do it ...  she forgets thatthe Thistles are in bloom and the Heather on fire&quot;,,    (16)    Barrhead, Renfrewshire.Air Raids.As noted in Report No0 8, morale is highest in places that have been most badly bombed, though the generalstandard throughout the country is amazingly goode      Thereis a general complaint of lack of sleep, but writers whospeak of shattered nerves would appear to be people whoare normally uncourageous, and where mention is made ofchildren&apos;s terror it would seem in most cases, to be the fault of the mother.Many letters express pleasure at the discovery,after experiencing an air-raid, that the writers are notafraid after all.&quot;I thought I should be terribly afraid when wehad a raid, but I was not at all, only ratherexcited and thrilled.    (17)    Birmingham.Praise of Anderson Shelters is general;    thefeeling of confidence and security they give is such thatit seems the family shelter is likely to become asintegral a part of the house as the kitchen or the garage.Pride in their decoration is frequently expressed^ andenjoyment of the parties held in them during the raids.&quot;The neighbours and I have papered our air-raidshelter,  and I must say it is lovely.      We putnice linoleum on the floor and it&apos;s just likehome from home&quot;.    (18)    Dundee.

A schoolgirl writes:-    &quot;We enjoy ourselves inthe air-raid shelter at school because we havelearned new songs about Hitler&quot;.    (19) Newoastie-on- Tyne .There is little or no complaint at failure to sound the sirens before a raid, but deep interest ininspecting the damage after one.     A number of writersmention finding that dud bombs which had fallen in theirneighbourhood were filled with sand or cement and boremessages showing they came from Czech factories.Blackout.Dread of the blackout in the approaching winteris mentioned very frequently.&quot;You were asking me if the war affected us any,well,  it did last winter because the cinemas and places of amusement were closed and we had nolamps lit in the streets 0.0   We are not botheringabout the war now, because the nights are lighter&quot;.(20)    Dundee.&quot;Everybody dreads this winter with the blackout&quot;      .(21)    LivjerjEOol.Confidence in the Navy and Air Force.Criticism of the fighting services is nil.Praise - not unnaturally, in view of the recent air-raids -centres mainly on the Air Force, but the Navy and merchant service receive grateful thanks for the safe convoy offood.      &apos;Britannia rules the Waves and Air&apos; is becoming a popular slogan, and an almost childlike faith in thepower of both services to protect them is shown by many people.&quot;If we hear an unfamiliar sound in the sky, wejust leave it to the R0A.F,     Aren&apos;t theygreat&quot;.    (22).Service Opinion.The fighting spirit is very high in all theservices, not excluding the Home Guard.      A certainrestlessness is shown at continued inaction.      Soldiersback from Dunkirk show much more venom against the Germansthan those who have never been in action against them.A Canadian private writes:-   &quot;They kept us from norway, recalled us from France, and now wewonder if we will ever see some action.      Apartfrom the occasional air-raids, we have had no.   fun at all&quot;,    (23)&quot;The Rifle Brigade to which I was posted .., tellme that the Germans are more &apos;Boche&apos;  than ever, andhave not the slightest compunction in using terrorismagainst civilians as a weapon&quot;.    (2k)

A letter from an aircraft man:- &quot;Fun, it&apos;s aD..... picnic, that5 s what it is. Youfd payfive hon for a seat at a Henley air show likeI!ve got for this little scrap&quot;.    (25)Invasion,Fear of invasion is almost nil.      Opinion is fairly equally divided as to whether it will he attemptedor not.     Those who think it will not come &quot;base theirargument on our complete preparedness to meet it;    thosewho expect it consider, for the same reason, that it isdoomed to failure,,     Among the former are a number ofwriters who   .openly fear that it will not he attempted.&quot;The invasion is now no longer considered on thecards by many,      The precautions are too thorough&quot;.(26)   East Grinstoadt-. &quot; o. , 0. even if they did invade, they could not maintain even a small army very long with ourNavy and wonderful Air Force ,...&quot; (27) Newcastle-on-Tyne.&quot;We know there will be an attempt at invasion, we know&quot;it will be a failure&quot;.    (28)   Manchester.&quot;The only thing people seem to he afraid of it that Hitler won&apos;t invade us after all&quot;    (29)War ley,i5u,.Es s e x.Radio;    Press and Propaganda.Consensus of opinion is that B.B.C. news bulletins are sound and reliable,,Many letters praise highly Dorothy Thompson&apos;broadcast;    others consider Priestley the only worth-whileBritish radio speaker, and a great number say that, whileLord Haw-Haw !used to give them a good laugh, he isgetting stale now5.    (37)    There is no mention either of the N.BoB0So  or the !Workers&apos; Challenge&apos; stations.Evacuation Overseas.Outcry over the evacuation of the children ofthe rich has died down.      Only a few uneducated writerscontinue to echo the usual comments, and the majority of letters are concerned with the polite refusal of offers ofhospitality for themselves or their children in the U.S.A.This switch-over of feeling is interesting as illustratingthe changed outlook with regard to the outcome of the war.The following extracts are typical of the general feeling.&quot;Thank you so very much, my dear, for offering tohave us, but . . c we want to be here and alltogether to celebrate the greatest victory ofall times&quot;o    (33)

&quot;To tear the children away from England now wouldmalke me feel that I was forsaking her In her hourof need.      There are things even the children can do to help the national effort, and I think it ishest for them, morally, to remain here and take their part&quot;,    (39)&quot;Our young folks won&apos;t hear of leaving the countryjust now,,      They say it is too much like runningaway in the day of need&quot;,,    (40)Another point of view, and one perhaps not, as yet sufficiently stressed is put forward hy a Britishmother already in the U.S. writing to her husband:&quot;You know how you felt about it and the shame you said yecrd feel at their going,,      It was not until we heard all the children were to go, rich and pooralike, that you decided to send us ... but hitchesoccurred, and soon we left and the poor werestopped going and the ire turned on the rich whohad gone 0.0    I ask you as my right to be allowedto return Life will never be worth livingto me when I do got back to England after the war.I will only feel a burning shame&quot;.    (41)Opinion on Public Affairs,Comments on world events are surprisingly few.There is no mention of the evacuation of Somaliland;    only two on the closing of the Burma Road, and none on theU.S./Canadian mutual defence negotiations.Attitude to Germany.Except for remarks by soldiers, already mentioned,enmity to Germany seems to be centred mainly on Hitler.Writers seem to regard the war as a personal strugglebetween Britain and Hitler himself, or, In a few cases,himself, as leader of the Nazi regime.      The German people are scarcely mentioned.      There is a strong feeling,however;. that the war must be carried into Germany, before it can be brought to a successful conclusion.&quot;How glad we shall be when we can go over in agreat host and invade Germany&quot;.    (42)   London.&quot;I don&apos;t believe there is a man to be found whowould say &apos;give them Peace&apos;.    We are going to berlin&quot;.    (43)   Leamington &quot;j3pla.Dr. Goehhels, surprisingly, is never mentioned,and the dropping of Hitler leaflets has,  apparently, givenmost writers  5 a good laugh&apos;, though some scornfully pointout that his speech had already been broadcast in fullin this country0Attitude to FranceuIn striking contrast to the enmity to Hitler,as opposed to Germans as a whole, there is no reference in this mail to the Retain Government, but a constant andbitter mention of Prance&apos;s defection, of the unpreparednessof her army and the scandals in her administration.

Attitude to other Countries.Czechs are &quot;barely mentioned;    there is muchpraise for Polish refugees in this country;    Leopold has been completely forgotten.Attitude to America.Many writers are irritated by the wrong impression of conditions in Britain voiced, by their correspondents inthe States, and a number of them put this down to thepoorness of our propaganda and the excellence of the Germanvariety.      Others are at pains to emphasize the normalityof life in war-time England, and accuse their Americanfriends of being &apos;far more jittery than we are here&apos;.    (hh)There are innumerable warnings to disregard Germanradio news and listen only to the B.B.G. bulletins;    anda great number take a rather sarcastic pleasure inreminding Americans that we are fighting for their libertyas well as our own, and that any help they are giving usis paid for by Britain in hard cash,,&quot;Don&apos;t you realise that if we   were conquered, you would be the next victim?&quot;  (h5)&quot;I guess you Americans feel pretty safe basking inthe sun on your beaches, while the British Empiregives up her best youth so that you may still enjoythat bathes and reap the profit from the armamentswe are purchasing from you&quot;.    (46)&quot;Although you are supplying us with some fightingmaterials, please remember that we are paying forthese in hard cash&quot;.    (hi)The demand for more planes is insistent.&quot;If you people ...  have a few old aeroplanes thatyou don&apos;t want, send them along ...  so let us have some planes by return of post&quot;.    (h&amp;)Food for Europe.Many writers are insistent that on no account should America send foodships, and no correspondent is infavour of such acti en j&quot;I hope you wonft get soft and send provisions.They will only go to Germany&quot;.    (h9)&quot;The U.SC wwl not go all sentimental and sendfood, even to unocciroi^r! France.      It&apos;s a realweapon to enforce hunger, but so is a dive-bomber ...    My slogan is TEvery bottle of milk to a French baby, means a bomb on an english baby&quot;.    (50)

Foreign opinion In this country.American opinion is almost lyrical in itspraise of the present spirit of England.      An American&quot;businessman writes: -&quot;There is a different spirit in England.      Thismagnificent people have girded themselves fora fight to the finish and are determined towin no matter the cost ...      The British are agreat race&quot;,    (51)Unstinted praise, both of this nation and ofthe treatment they are receiving here comes from soldiers,refugees,, and visitors;    Dutch, Spanish, French, Polish,Portuguese, Argentine, Czech and so on.A Catalan refugee writes:      &quot;We were struck witha courtesy strange to us, poor sub-humans, coming from the land of our French brothers (the swinethey have  shown themselves to bej) accustomed tothe growling of their gendarmes  ...&quot; (52)A Polish soldier&apos;s opinion:      &quot;We are today enjoyingthe kindly bread &quot;of the hospitals and splendidEnglish people.      Our soldiers are very pleased andhappy with the very hearty welcome received inEngland,  and which was lacking in France&quot;.    (53)A French Officer says:      &quot; I want- to bring my smallcontribution to the &quot;defence of this green island,which I happen to love,      England has givenus not only material but enormous spiritualadvantages.     Wo came here with faces white withshame and thoy allowed us to find ourselves again ...as God is my witness, I will show HcM. Governmentthat    it did not lose the money it invested in me!&quot;(54)Food and RationingsExtreme irritation is the keynote of many letters,replying to American friends who &quot;believe that Britain isstarving and offer to send parcels of food0     Writers takegreat pains to explain how admirably the rations cover our needs, and again advise their correspondents not to listen to German propaganda on the suhjecto      Some letterssuggest that this propaganda is inspired by the wish, to fill up shipping space with food parcels which should heused for munitions.    (55 ).Chief complaints are from mothers of families,regarding the hutter ration, and from other, unclassified,females as to the shortage of tea and sugar.      There areno complaints of shortage of meat.General satisfaction is expressed &quot;by working class people -with the fact that rationing ensuresdistrihutica to rich and poor alike.     Many lettersmention with pride the fine crops of fruit and vegetablesraised in their gardens or allotments,  and the sugar

allowed for jam-making.      Writers suggest that thepresent restrictions are necessitated hy the presenceof thousands of refugees in this country.Rationing is almost universally accepted as a necessary means to the end of winning the war;    writersdescribe with pride their various devices for ekeing outsupplies,  and many letters emphasize the difference between this and the last war, when people had to stand for hours in food queues.&quot;There is a rationing scheme which enables richand poor alike to get an equal quantity ofstuff&quot;,    (56) London&quot;We have so many folk from other countries to feed,we are put on short rations  ..0 but still, this isa small matter,  and I don&apos;t mind so long as ithelps to win the war&quot;,    (57) Bristol.but now I get the best tea I can for our6 0Z0  and we dry the tealeaves and use themagain&quot;.    (58)    Battersea,&quot;Were you in London during the last war?     Then you must remember the queues there were then.      The onlyqueues you&apos;11 ever see now are those waiting togo into a theatre&quot;    (59) Southampton.Trade and Taxation.aCorrespondence on the Budget is dying down.Some still consider the Income Tax should have been heavier.A Gravesend man writes:    &quot;The Income Tax was a bit of ajolt, but most people seem to think it should have been-higher&quot;.      (Si)   while many others consider that anyhardship is worth while to win the war.&quot;If we have to sacrifice everything, it will be worth it&quot;.    (61)    London^&quot;We&apos;11 pay until the job is through.      That&apos;sthe broad spirit&quot;,    (62)    Salford, Lanes.In connection it is interesting to note thatthere is no mention of exacting reparations from Germanyafter the war.Some owners of businesses say that they willbe ruined by the Budget, but these letters are few in number.      Others complain of the Purchasing Tax,  arguing that, v/hile it has resulted in a momentary increase oftrade, caused by a rush to purchase before it comes intoforce, there will be a permanent slump as soon as it is inactive operation.Direct taxation has aroused some bitter complaints,mostly from men regarding the increased price of cigarettesand beer;    though a Glasgow stalwart faces up the situation:&quot;Every pint    I drink puts another rivet in a Battle-ship.      I think I have built one myself since thewar started&quot;.    (63).

Factory workers refuse to work side &quot;by side withconscientious objectors, &quot;but appreciate very much the installation of radio sets, which increase the dailyoutput of work?.    and finally, old-age pensioners are,almost without an exception, awed at the thought of receiving more money while there is also a war to bepaid for,    (6h, 65, 66 )0&quot;I was ever so surprised when they told me I coulddraw another 11/- a week,,     My word, extra moneywhen there is a terrible war on and they need allthe money they can get!&quot; (67).EIRE.Morale ,Writers in this Mail are, on the whole, of a lower social grade than those of the American Mail, butthe standard of morale is equally high and confidence inultimate victory is general,..      There is, of course,almost complete absence of the  &apos;propaganda writing5 foundin the other letters;    and writers do not find it necessaryto explain why-   we are fighting the war, nor what a grandpeople we are0      Letters are concerned much more withdetails of domestic life, and particulars of husbands, sonsand brothers in the fighting services, the AoRoP0  or theLCD,V,   (58, 69)0Criticism of the government,, war-time restrictionsetc0 comes mainly from Irish people living in this country,Air^ Raids aHere again there is every sign of courage,  evenin the case of people who have lost their homes0&quot;We experienced a rough time of it, but it takesmore than that to kill our British spirit c,.My homo is finished and most of the things.     Wesuffered three: bombs 0.0      Had I been In bed Ishould have been killed&quot;,    (70) Maryport.Appreciation of the Anderson shelters Is voicedc ont inually,&quot;We are having a great time here,     We spend nearly every night in our Anderson shelter,     We feel everso safe inside it.      We have enough soil on it tocover a field&quot; ,    (71) Billingham9j Durham.Some writers are annoyed at rumours prevalent in Ireland of destruction done &quot;by raids;A working man writes from Newcastle:    &quot;r am surethere is some great rumours in&quot;&apos;ireland,     Thepeople here is not much annoyed by the planescoming.t we all go to the shelters and singsongs&quot;,    (72).And from Norwich another writer says:    &quot;Heboth calls you up in the morning and bumps you

1 KIt)downstairsc      (That was when ho and hodcomplete had landed in the street)&quot;.  (73)Lack of sleep is still the chief complaint.&quot;I cannot sleep and all the flesh has slidodoff me somehow&quot;. Sp_11.derland,,Writers from many North of England towns complain offlooding of their shelters, but? as one writer says:i;They said . . . they would rather stand in waterthan feel the house shaking and the vs/indowsrattling&quot;.    (75) Miaaiesprough.Seryicjes.Praise of the services is universal, particularly,again-, of the Air Force and the Merchant Marine.   (76, 77).Invasion^Opinion is again divided as whether Hitler willattempt invasion or not, hut all are convinced thatif he does the attempt will prove a failure.  (78, 79, 80).RadiooCorrespondents are again warned to take theirnews only from B0B,C0 &quot;broadcasts,      Writers mention horedomwith Lord Haw-Haw, &quot;but some are, apparently, finding muchamusement from the new &apos;Workers   Challenge&apos;.      Haw-Haw isidentified with William Joyce &quot;by several writers.  (83, 8h).Evacuation of Children..Writers again seem, in the main,  against the ideaof sending their children away;   hut more on the grounds ofthe danger of an ocean voyage without convoy, and also because they consider that &apos;children are better with their parents&quot;&apos; .  (85,. 86) 0Fp^oa \ahd-. -Ratipni-ag[;.rComplaints of shortage of butter and bacon comemainly from people with Irish names,,      Most people agree thatthe rations are ample and forbid their correspondents to try to send thorn supplies from Ireland,      Others point out againthat there are no food queues now as in the last war.Fruit and vegetables are reported as being plentiful andcheap,   (87, 88, 89,  90,  91).Trade.^and Tasation^Working men approve of the idea of deducting IncomeTax at source.      Old-age pensioners in some cases grumble atthe means test and say it puts a premium on improvidence.Several writers complain of the strain of working long hours and the seven-day-week      Taxation of beer and tobacco Iscomplained of with the usual rider that if it helps to win the&quot;war the writers don&apos;t mind.    (92, 93, 9k9 95, 96, 97).
