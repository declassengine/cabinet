V&quot;&quot;]4TH SEPTEMBER. 1940.WAR CABIIiET.__EFFECT OH PRODUCTION OP AIR RAID WARNINGS.___Conclusions of Informal Meeting heldin the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Room on 4th September, 1940.1, The system of giving &quot;red&quot; warnings shouldbe retained, in view of the extensive evidence tothe effect that its abolition would, cause loss ofconfidence.2c An authoritative statement should, be madeto the effect that everybody engaged on useful workand. not in a position of special danger should continue his or her work on receipt of the &quot;red!! warning, andshould not seel: shelter until specific instructionsY/ere received (or until guns or bombs were heard).3. To facilitate the operation of this plan,  thesystem of roof watchers should be developed, aswidely as possible.4. The practice of Government Departments should conform to this plan; and the present misapprehensionthat work stops in Government Offices during the &quot;red&quot;-warning periods should be corrected,5. Wherever possible, essential public transport services should continue on the same lines as other services on receipt of the &quot;red&quot; warning, but in framing any announcement due regard, should be paidto negotiations at present going on with the Tr&amp;nsportWorkers Union in regard to London fbus services.Warnings at night.6, The importance of adequate sleep should be emphasised.,    . The people should be told that it wasup to them to see that the enemy did not succeed, by sending over a few. &quot;planes each night, both indirectly holding up production and in affecting itindirectly by depriving workers of their sleepo

7, To give effect to the policy in 6, the &quot;red&quot;warning should he given sparingly at night, the&apos;&quot;purple&quot; warning heing used to ensure the adoptionof essential safety measures^,3. The logical conclusion of this policy wouldhe that the &quot;red&quot; warning should never or hardlyever he given at night hy means of sounding thesirens.     But to do this at once would he too suddena change9. The announcement made as to the changesdecided upon should he so framed as to cast no aspersionson the behaviour of the people of the country duringthe last few weeks, hut should be rather on the basis that new instructions were necessary for dealing with anew situation.      So far as workers on war production were concerned, there should be no threats of harsh action under the law, but it would he well for Ministers to visit factories and give talks to the workers, explainingwhat was being asked, of them.10.        It was noted with regret that it was not practicable at this stage to substitute any other formof audible warning for the sirens at present In use.Richmond Terrace, S.&apos;.7.1. ,4TH SEFTEMBER, 1940.
