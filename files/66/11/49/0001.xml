(40) 740) jSeptember 13, 1940 \JTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET-WEEKLY RESUME(No. 54)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon September 5th to12 noon September 12th,1940[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff. 1Cabinet War Room.
2NAYAL SITUATION.General Review.AIR attack on the London Docks has caused appreciable casualties to merchant vessels and, combined with the threat of invasion, some interruption of the East Coast Convoy system.Sinkings by TJ-boat have decreased. Reports of raiders in the S. atlantic and Indian Ocean have been received from merchant vessels.There has been a very marked movement of enemy merchant ships and bargeswestward along the southern shores of the North Sea and English Channel.Light forces have been carrying out sweeps off the French, Belgian and DutchCoasts, during which they have encountered and sunk several enemy vessels.Sweeps have also been carried out toward Iceland and the Norwegian Coastby heavy forces, but apart from a few merchant vessels near the coast, nothing was encountered.Home Waters.2. Owing to the concentrations of enemy barges and small craft at channel ports and other evidence of threatened invasion, additional cruisers were movedsouth on the 6th September. During the night light forces were ordered to keepat immediate notice during dark hours, and certain East coast convoys were retained in harbour.An M.T.B. and three drifters were attacked whilst attempting to rescueGerman airmen in the Channel. The Captain and three of the crew of the M.T.B.were wounded and the boat herself slightly damaged.3. During the dark hours of the 7th/8th September, two of our M.T.B.&apos;sfired torpedoes at what appeared to be merchant vessels off Calais, and bothtorpedoes were heard to explode. The M.T.B.&apos;s also attacked a tug with machine guns. A few barges were seen in Calais. Destroyers which later proceeded tothe Calais area did not encounter any enemy.4. The following night a cruiser and some destroyers bombarded Boulognefor a short time in difficult weather conditions. No opposition was encountered.Another cruiser and destroyers reconnoitred Calais, but found nothing and didnot open fire. Destroyers sweeping between Le Touquet and Cape Antifer alsosighted nothing. M.T.B.&apos;s sighted enemy E-boats off Dunkirk, and attacked20 merchant vessels sighted off Ostend. Four attacks were made, one torpedobeing fired in each, and two hits were obtained on vessels estimated to be ships of1,000 and 2,000 tons. An air attack on Ostend which coincided with this attackprovided an excellent diversion, and it is thought that our M.T.B.&apos;s were notobserved.  Flares dropped by aircraft were helpful.On the 9th September an aircraft of the Coastal Command bombed an escort vessel off Ostend.Our destroyers reconnoitring off Calais on the night of the9th/10th September were unsuccessfully attacked by an E-boat, and werecontinually fired on by shore batteries, some shots falling very close. Off Boulogneother destroyers encountered one auxiliary craft, which was sunk, and one E-boat,which was damaged.Off Dieppe on the 10th September a Blenheim attacked merchant vessels andE-boats, probably sinking two of the latter. -During the night lOth/llth September our destroyers attacked shippingoff Ostend with the assistance of flares dropped by aircraft. Three barges towedby a trawler and a merchant vessel were hit several times, and were thought tohave sunk. Other destroyers sweeping off Dieppe and Le Touquet sightednothing.Dover was shelled by enemy coastal batteries on the 9th and 11th September,two M.T.B.&apos;s being damaged on the latter occasion.H.M.S. A therstone, escorting a westbound channel convoy, was hit duringan air attack off the North Foreland on the 11th September and was towed toSheerness. The convoy was undamaged. Aircraft of the Coastal Commandattacked a convoy off Calais and set one ship on fire and probably damaged asecond. On the following night destroyers carried out a sweep off the Dutch andFrench coasts, but no enemy was sighted.
During the afternoon of the 7th September the enemy made a heavy air attackon the London Docks, which was continued during this and subsequent nights,inflicting casualties to shipping which are given in detail later in this resume, butdespite these attacks, with minor exceptions, the quay facilities in the port are reported intact.  Ocean-going vessels have been ordered to leave.ELM. Trawler Abronia was sunk by bomb, but is being salved, and h.M. Boarding Vessels Inkosi and Ananda became total wrecks owing to firecaused by bombs.5. During the night the 6th/7th September H.M.S. Godetia was sunk in collision with a merchant vessel off Rathlin Island; twenty of her crew are missing.H.M, Yacht Rhodora sank after collision with a merchant vessel off Cardiffon the 7th September, only one man being injured. On the 8th SeptemberH.M. Destroyers Hesperus and Wolverine were attacked by aircraft in the st. George&apos;s Channel, but without result.On the night of the 8th/9th September H.M.S. Stork was hit aft by a bombor torpedo from aircraft in Methil Roads, one officer and one man being wounded;she was taken in tow by H.M.S. Verdun.Northern Waters.6. A force which included heavy ships has been at sea between Norway andthe Shetlands, and a cruiser sweep has been carried out towards Iceland. fleet air Arm aircraft from H.M.S. Furious attacked enemy shipping off theNorwegian coast on the 7th September. Little shipping was seen, but two vessels were successfully attacked, one of which was Danish, and were last seen abandoned and sinking.On the 9th September Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm from Hatston also attacked shipping on the Norwegian Coast. They hit a merchant vessel of about,500 tons in Haugesund, and damaged an oiler of the same size at Dolvik wherethey also destroyed oil cisterns and buildings.On the 10th September a Blenheim on reconnaissance attacked and disableda merchant vessel in the Sogne Fiord.7. The Norwegian Fishery Protection Vessel Fridjhof Nansen arrived atReykjavik on the 10th September, having destroyed the Meteorological Stationon Jan Mayen Island (east of Greenland) and removed its operator on the7th September.A pro-German station was discovered in Flemings Inlet (on the WestGreenland Coast, North of Scoresby Sound) where there were four Danes withinstruments for four stations, rifles for 20 men, machine guns, ammunition and stores.   These were removed and the station burnt down on the 7th September.H.M. Submarine Sturgeon on return from patrol reported that she had sunk a northbound 10,000 tons transport in the entrance to the Kattegat on the2nd September, and also that she believed she had sunk a large northboundU-Boat forty miles South-West of the Naze on the 10th September.Foreign Stations.8. Apart from the movement of convoys there has been little activity inthe Mediterranean. Air attacks were made on Malta on the 5th and the7th September, and in the latter ELM. Submarine Olympus was slightly damaged and the tug Hellespont was sunk. Some damage was done to buildings in the dockyard and a wharf.9. A Convoy in the Red Sea escorted by H.M.S. Leander was attacked by aircraft three times on the 6th September. One enemy aircraft was probably damaged by Leander. Another convoy was attacked three times on the 5thSeptember.  All attacks were unsuccessful.The S.S. Trebartha on the 6th September reported being approached by araider, 600 miles North-West of Ascension Island. One of ELM. Ships in thevicinity made a search but found nothing.[21742] b
The British Tanker A thelking was shelled by a raider on the 9th September,550 miles East of Mauritius, and on the morning of the following day the BritishBenarty was bombed by an aircraft North-East of this position. H.M. ships in the vicinity have been ordered to search.10. H.M.S. Delhi arrived at Pointe Noire (French Equatorial Africa) on 6th September and reported that the town was in Free French hands and that herwelcome was good. At the request of General de Larminat Delhi subsequentlyproceeded to Lagos, where she arrived on 11th September.Six French cruisers have proceeded from Toulon to Casablanca, where they now are. A strong British force is patrolling off the port and the French ships are to be informed that they cannot be permitted to go to Dakar if they attemptto do so.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. Three attacks by surface craft and four by aircraft were made in home waters without result. In one case the U-boat was attacked by both surface craft and aircraft.On the 6th September H.M. Submarine Tribune fired two torpedoes at asubmerged U-boat 15 miles N.E. of St. Kilda and it is believed that one hit was obtained.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.12. During the period nine ships, totalling 29,000 tons, have been sunk by enemy action. Of these two British (3,835 tons) and two Greek (7,848 tons) were sunk by U-boat; one Dutch (5,750 tons) was sunk by E-boat; one British (4,647tons) and one Norwegian (4,332 tons) were sunk by aircraft; and two british ships (2,655 tons) were mined. Details of the sinkings are given in Appendix Iand include four British ships (17,285 tons) which were sunk prior to the periodof this Resume, but had not been previously recorded.In addition to the above losses five British (24,987 tons) and five Dutch ships(10,458 tons) are submerged in the London Docks, and nineteen other ships were damaged, five seriously.  Details are given in Appendix II.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. 834 ships, including 110 Allied and 37 Neutrals, were convoyed dtiringthe week ending the 11th September, and of these 13 were lost due to enemy action.One A/A Cruiser, 10 Armed Merchant Cruisers, 38 destroyers and 39 sloopsand corvettes have been employed on escort duty.Since the start of the war 36,000 ships have been convoyed, of which 109 havebeen lost whilst in convoy.Enemy Intelligence.German.14. Air reconnaissance on the 5th September showed Gneisenayi,Scharnhorst and lutzow were still in dock at Kiel, and the battleship Tirpitzand an 8-inch cruiser at Wilhelmshaven. By the 10th September the 8-inch cruiser had left Wilhelmshaven. Air reconnaissance on the 11th Septembershowed the three ships completing, Bismarck at Hamburg, the 8-inch cruiserSeydlitz at Bremen and the Tirpitz at Wilhelmshaven, still in their appropriateports. The concentrations of barges at Flushing, Ostend and Calais and the movements of shipping on these coasts, which have been observed and attackedduring the course of the week, appear to be liable to three interpretations (a) They may be preparations for invasion.(&amp;) They may be a means of bringing stores to the G.A.F. in northern france, &amp;c.(c) They may be a dummy target for our bombers to divert them fromobjectives in Germany itself.The first-mentioned interpretation is believed to be the correct one.
15. The enemy has continued to maintain three or four submarines in theNorth-West Approaches throughout the period under review. From the 6th tothe 9th September he seems to have kept at least 2 far out to the Westward inthe Atlantic, but latterly there may not have been more than one. A new featurethis week is that there have been indications that patrols may have beenestablished in the North Sea, but as yet clear proof is lacking.Italian.16. There is little information as to Italian surface units in the period under review. Air reconnaissance over Sicilian waters reported one destroyersteering eastward outside the Straits of Messina on the 11th September, and onedestroyer and two merchant ships in Syracuse on the same date.An Italian submarine was sighted by aircraft on the 2nd September 10 milesfrom Alboran Island off the South Coast of Spain, and a further report from thesame area on the 4th September occasioned an unsuccessful hunt by 4 destroyers.It seems that at least one Italian submarine is still at work in the Red sea and torpedoed the Greek tanker Atlas in those waters on the 6th September.Two Italian submarines have been at work off the Spanish and Portuguesecoasts or between them and the Azores.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.17. The Bremen, 51,731 tons, and the Europa, 49,746 tons, were alongsideColumbus Quay, Bremerhaven, on the 9th September. On the 4th Septemberthey had been seen at Flamburg. Ten other merchant ships, or transports, were reported to be at Bremen on the 5th September; five of these were identified by name, their tonnages varying between 5,900 and 8,500 tons. At sea between theElbe and Bremen or in the Elbe estuary on the 5th and the 6th September, elevenmore merchant ships were reported, only two of which were not identified by name. Three of these were said to be hospital ships, one of which is over 25,000tons; the other ten ships vary between 1,500 tons and 13,400 tons.It is now known that the tanker Winnetou, 5,113 tons, which sailed fromthe Canary Islands on the 9th April, twice fuelled the raider (on the 9th Mayand the 21st June) which sank the Haxby and captured the Tropic Sea. She was still in company with the raider on the 30th June, though then nearly empty. Shearrived at Kobe, Japan, on the 29th August.The aeroplane service ship Ostmark, 1,280 tons, left the Canaries on the6th September and was reported to be going to Dakar.The Borkum, 3,760 tons, which after being taken in prize by H.M.S.California in November was torpedoed by a German submarine and abandoned,has been salvaged and will be ready to leave Kirkwall on the 12th September.Italian.18. It has been reported from Durazzo that an Italian collier was lost by mine or torpedoes between Bari and Durazzo on the 22nd August.The tanker Celeno, 3,741 tons, arrived at Varna on the 4th September fromBatum with 5,000 tons of petroleum.The Iranian Government have made a proposal to buy the Italian tankerBarbara, 3,065 tons, which is at Bandar Shahpur.The Teresa, 6,131 tons, which is at Rio de Janeiro has been placed under an embargo on account of a debt due to the Asiatic Petroleum Company.British Minelaying.19. On the 5th September the 1st Minelaying Squadron laid 1,520 minesoff the Faroe Islands and on the 11th September the same ships laid a deepminefield of about 2,000 mines in the North-Western Approaches.H.M. Ships Intrepid, Icarus and Impulsive laid 72 mines in the Straits ofDover on the 6th September.Minelaying by aircraft has been continued chiefly in the Bay of Biscay areathough some have been laid off Le Havre and in the Elbe.[21742] b 2
Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.20. During the last month enemy aircraft have laid fewer mines than usual,particularly between the Dumber south and west to Falmouth. Minelaying has! been suspected in many places on account of the visits of enemy aircraft, but thej results of magnetic minesweeping off the coasts tends to show that few, if any,1 mines have been dropped between the Humber and Falmouth. Off the Humberand to the northward mines have been laid.Three casualties have been caused by magnetic mines during the week.the4th September to the 11th September, and fourteen mines have been swept. one has been recovered in the Bristol Channel. The total number of magnetic minesaccounted for to date is 666.On the 3rd September a Minesweeping Trawler reported a moored mine onthe surface to seaward of the Portsmouth Approaches. H.M.S. Vernon recoveredthis mine, and in the subsequent sweeping operations three were exploded andone more was recovered. A dangerous area was declared and is still in force as sweeping has not been comj)leted. It is considered probable that these mines were laid by E-Boat.Four magnetic mine dangerous areas have been searched and cancelled, alloff the East Coast.The northern approach to Kirkwall, Westray Firth, was closed on the3rd September for six days as minelaying was suspected.As more LL sweeps are now available at Yarmouth and the Humber, it hasbeen decided to search daily those sections of the East Coast War Channel whichare less than 20 fathoms in depth.Foreign Waters.21. H.M.S. Illustrious cut a mine with her paravanes during an eastwardpassage in the Mediterranean. H.M. Ships Liverpool and Gloucester cut mineswith their paravanes when bombarding Mersa Tobruk.A summary of the mines swept off Alexandria has now been received, andadds a further 19 to the 20 already reported. Mines were swept in depths varvingfrom 130 to 220 fathoms.22. During the period under review conditions indicating the imminence of invasion have increased. Considerable activity of shipping has been reported from a number of ports in the Baltic, the information regarding Bremen includingdetails suggesting invasionpreparations. A large number of barges, having beenassembled in the canals of Holland and Belgium, has in the last three days movedsouthwards and westward towards Ostend, Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne. these movements, considered in conjunction with the increased scale of air attack on london, appear to indicate that an attempt at invasion is likely.Italy and Italian Possessions.23. The Italian offensive from Libya is still delayed. As mentioned in para-graph 27 below a force estimated at one division has recently moved eastwardstowards Sidi Omar.24. In Italian East Africa there are indications that an offensive may soon be launched against the Sudan along the Asmara-Kassala axis. This offensivemay start simultaneously with a thrust southwards against Kenya, although noabnormal troop concentrations have yet been reported in this region.25. The greatest secrecy is being maintained by the General Staff regardingmilitary measures, but there is little doubt that the army is being brought up towar strength as rapidly as possible.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.Greece.
Iceland.26.   Eight additional Coast Defence guns are now en route.Faroes.27. Part of two additional squadrons of Lovat Scouts have arrived (ninety-three all ranks).Middle East.Egypt.28. On the 8th September the railway line from Mersa Matruh was cut byan enemy bombing attack, and 500 gallons of army petrol was lost.An enemy force estimated at one Division has made a considerable moveeastwards, and halted on the evening of the 10th September in an area West and north of Sidi Omar and about 5 to 15 miles from that place.Sudan.29. Enemy activity within the Kassala defences continues, and movementof heavy lorries was heard during the night 6th-7th September.East Africa.30. In the Turkhana province there were indications of activity on the4th September, and the garrison has been increased by one battalion.West Indies.31.   Two Coast Defence guns have now been mounted at Curacao.AIR SITUATION.General Review.32. Our bombing operations against Germany were on a similar scale tothose of previous weeks, but, in addition to continuing our offensive against theusual targets, a considerably augmented series of attacks was centred upon con-concentrations of barges and shipping along the coasts of France and Holland. Anumber of varied targets in Berlin were bombed with satisfactory results.Attacks against Italy were restricted to a light raid on Turin.33. The enemy&apos;s tactics at first consisted of renewed and unsuccessfulattempts to break down our fighter defence by further attacks on Britishaerodromes. Later a new phase developed and attacks were directed to military targets with the object of disrupting communications and creating chaos in theLondon Dock area. A third phase followed which seemed to have as its aim thedemoralisation of the civil population by indiscriminate night bombing.Although general damage has been considerable, no serious dislocation of thecountry&apos;s war effort was caused.34. Our aircraft successfully attacked a number of enemy aerodromes onthe Libyan coast. In East Africa several Italian aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground by bombers of the South Africa Air Force. No damageof military importance was caused by enemy attacks except at Mersa Matruhand Haifa.Great Britain.35. Oh the 5th and 6th September enemy bombers continued their daylight attacks on aerodromes, without, however, creating serious dislocation; at noon on the 12th September none of our aerodromes was unserviceable by day, and only one by night. No. aircraft were lost on the ground.36. About 700 aircraft were employed in attacks on this country during daylight on the 7th September, and late that afternoon a large-scale offensivewas launched against industrial and dock property on both sides of the Thames,
coupled with, a systematic attempt to destroy road and rail communications inthe London area, possibly with the object of isolating the capital. In this instance, unusual accuracy was displayed and considerable damage resulted,particularly in the dock areas. Very heavy casualties were inflicted on the enemy,and large-scale daylight attacks were not repeated until the 11th, when equallyheavy losses were suffered by the attackers, this time without any compensatingsuccess. On this occasion enemy formations totalled some 250 aircraft, 80 ofwhich, including 49 bombers, were destroyed by fighters and nine by A.A. fire.37. A feature of the enemy&apos;s activity by day was a continuation of the very heavy fighter protection provided for his bombers. Our fighters were able tomaintain their ascendancy and to disperse the enemy formations, Czech and polish squadrons co-operating Avitih considerable success. One interceptedGerman message stated : &quot; Break off task if fighter opposition is too strong.&quot;German dive-bombers have again not been identified during the week&apos;s operations,but it is reported that Me. 110 Jaguars were employed in a shallow-dive attackon Eastleigh.38. On the night of the 5th/6th September 250 aircraft carried out raids against industrial areas over most of England, but on the following five nightsactivity in the Provinces was reduced. After dark on the 7th Septemberintensive attacks by about 230 aircraft were directed against objectives in greater London similar to those attacked during the afternoon. Throughout therest of the week, from dusk to dawn, widespread attacks on London were maintained almost continuously, and, except on the 11th September, on a large scale, relays of four or more aircraft dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the suburbs and within the Inner Artillery Zone. Bombing appearedto be largely indiscriminate, bombs falling in sixty Local Authority areas and inevery Metropolitan Borough, causing serious, though not crippling, damage.39. While London and its environs were the main targets, at night enemyraiders were also plotted over Provincial areas, but the number of aircraftemployed was relatively small, and damage was not considerable. forest fires were started near Stourport and Cuckfield and in the New Forest, but were soonunder control. On the night of the 11th/12th September fewer aircraft pene-trated the London area, probably owing to the powerful barrage set up by ouranti-aircraft guns, but a stream of raiders flew in pairs or singly to the bristol channel, and across Wales to Liverpool, bombs being dropped in these districts.40. Fighter Command flew 976 patrols involving 4,385 sorties. Details of casulties are given in Appendix VI.Enemy Territory in Europe.41. Bomber Command flew 96 day and 733 night sorties during the weekand Coastal Command aircraft also took part in operations. Throughout theweek lack of cloud cover hampered operations by day and on several nightsweather conditions were such that the location of targets and the observation of results were rendered difficult.42. Anti-Invasion attacks against shipping, dock installations and bargeswere the major tasks of the week and, under conditions of improved visibilityon the nights of the 8th/9th and the 9th/10th September, successful results were achieved against these targets at Calais, Dunkirk, Ostend, Boulogne, Bremen,Hamburg, near Emden and at other ports. Considerable destruction is reported,one aircraft claiming eight direct hits among sixty large barges in Ostend Basin.Particularly successful attacks on barges at Calais, Ostend and Flushing were also carried out on the llth/12th September. On two nights flares were droppedto assist naval units, as already described.43. Medium bombers successfully attacked gun emplacements at Cape GrisNez and numerous aerodromes in enemy use, bursts in most cases being observedon the targets, followed by fires and explosions. Heavy bombers continued theirharassing attacks on marshalling yards and aerodromes, including Colmaraerodrome, where a hangar apparently full of aircraft, together with two aircraftoutside, was set on fire.
44. Incendiary attacks on forest areas in Germany were continued and large fires resulted. The synthetic oil plant at Stettin and refineries at Hamburg andRegensburg were also set alight, and direct hits are claimed on the Focke Wulfairframe factory at Bremen. Targets at Berlin received attention on three nights -the Potsdam and Anhalter railway stations, the West Power Station, theB.M.W. motor works, Siemens cable works, Neukoln gas works and oil and other targets being hit. Considerable material damage is reported as the result of threeattacks on marshalling yards at Brussels. Bombs dropped at Turin registereddirect hits on two Fiat factories.North Sea and Coastal.45. During the week 380 patrols, involving 644 sorties, and 138 convoy escorts, were flown by Coastal Command, including the usual routine patrols overthe North Sea. Many photographic reconnaissances were flown, extending from norway to Brest. Minelaying continues. A considerable number of attacks weremade on shipping off the enemy&apos;s coasts, as described in the Naval Section.46. Enemy bomber-reconnaissance aircraft continued to operate over a wide area, including the Western Approaches, the English Channel, off the North-east coast, Southern Eire and South-West England. The Atlantic reconnaissance offthe West Coast of Eire and meteorological flights over the North Sea as far as the shetlands and the West Coast of Scotland were maintained. Enemy minelayingaircraft were again active, approximately forty being engaged each night,principally around our South and East Coasts.Middle East and Mediterranean.Malta.47. Italian aircraft approached the Island on four occasions. Thirty bombs were dropped on the 7th September, resulting in slight damage to navalinstallations and material damage to civilian property.Egypt and Libya.48. Attacks on most of the enemy aerodromes along the Libyan coast weremade on the 4th September by 34 Blenheims, on the 9th September by 35 Blenheimsand on the 10th September by 7 Blenheims. Good results were achieved in allthese operations.49. Mersa Matruh was attacked by Italian aircraft on the 5th, 6th and September, and also on the 8th September, when some damage was caused, as already described. Four S. 79&apos;s were destroyed by fighters seaward of Matruhon the 10th.Palestine.50. On the 8th September seven S. 79&apos;s attacked Haifa, causing considerable damage to power house, distillation plant and oil refining pipes, but there were no casualties. The following day six unidentified enemy aircraft attackedTel Aviv : 150 civilians were injured and damage was confined to private property.Sudan and East A frica.51. Operations on the 4th, 7th and 9th September by Battles of the SouthAfrican Air Force resulted in the destruction at Baidoa, Mogadiscio andSciasciamana of a total of two, probably three, aircraft on the ground and damage to twelve others.  One fighter was also shot down into the sea.52. Port Sudan and Khartoum were attacked during the week, but little damage was caused.Aden.53. On the 6th September three enemy aircraft attacked Aden, causingdamage to native houses.
coupled with a systematic attempt to destroy road and rail communications inthe London area, possibly with the object&apos;of isolating the capital. In this instance, unusual accuracy was displayed and considerable damage resulted,particularly in the dock areas. Very heavy casualties were inflicted on the enemy,and large-scale daylight attacks were not repeated until tJhe 11th, when equallyheavy losses were suffered by the attackers, this time without any compensatingsuccess.

Good results were achieved in allthese operations.      f49. Mersa Matruh was attacked by Italian aircraft on the 5th, 6th and September, and also on the 8th September, when some damage was caused, as already described. Four S. 79&apos;s were destroyed by fighters seaward of Matruhon the 10th.Palestine.50. On the 8th September seven S. 79&apos;s attacked Haifa, causing considerable damage to power house, distillation plant and oil refining pipes, but there were no casualties. The following day six unidentified enemy aircraft attackedTel Aviv : 150 civilians were injured and damage was confined to private property.Sudan and East A frica.51. Operations on the 4th, 7th and 9th September by Battles of the SouthAfrican Air Force resulted in the destruction at Baidoa, Mogadiscio andSciasciamana of a total of two, probably three, aircraft on the ground and damage to twelve others.  One fighter was also shot down into the sea.52. Port Sudan and Khartoum were attacked during the week, but little damage was caused.Aden.53. On the 6th September three enemy aircraft attacked Aden, causingdamage to native houses.
Air Intelligence.Germany.54. The dispositions of the German Air Force remain substantially unchanged. The two long-range bomber formations from Norway are nowstationed in Belgium. The short-range dive-bomber force, which was withdrawnfrom operations against this country on the 18th August, has now been concen-trated in the Calais area.55.   The examination of over 100 prisoners shows that the morale of the, German air force is still high.  This is especially so among the fighter pilots, thehigh morale of the heavy bomber crews being not quite so outstanding.   A reporth by a medical officer says, however, that many prisoners show signs of nervous[)j exhaustion.  There is no shortage of trained pilots.Italy.56. The 200 Italian pilots who were undergoing dive-bombing instructioni! j at the Thalerhof aerodrome were recalled to Italy before the completion of theirj I training. The reason for this curtailment was stated to be that the physique ofj /   the Italians was unequal to the strain.57. A squadron of the new Cant Z 1007, 3-engined long-range bomber, isnow operating from the Dodecanese. This aircraft has a radius of action of1,100 miles, which brings Iraq within range and may result in an increased scale of attack on Egypt.58. The preparation of new landing grounds in the Northern Sector ofEritrea is being expedited and all unserviceable aircraft are apparently being-repaired. These activities, taken in conjunction with a number of reconnaissance flights recently carried out by the Italians, may indicate an impending attack onPort Sudan.Roumania.59. The cession of two-thirds of Transylvania will have a serious effect onRoumania&apos;s aerodrome situation. The important air base at Cluj will pass toHungary as well as the new base now being constructed at Turda. In addition the main bomber base at Brasov as well as the aircraft factory at that placewill be within a short distance of the new frontier. It is reliably reported that under the terms imposed on Roumania at Vienna Germany is to have the rightto use air bases in Roumania. A number of Roumanian pilots have expressed awish to join the Royal Air Force.Yugoslavia.60. There is no hope of Germany delivering the 25 Messerschmitt Me. 109fighters on order to Yugoslavia.61. During July the demobilisation of the Air Force was in progress. Theaircraft were still at their war stations and were to remain there till September,when they will return to their normal peace time aerodromes.Switzerland.62. There is reason to believe that the Swiss Government, under Germanand Italian pressure, may be forced to take more serious measures to secure inter -ception of belligerent aircraft than any hitherto adopted. It is reported that anorder was given on the 5th September for the stationing of A.A. batteries(probably 75 mm.) high in the Swiss mountains to supplement existing A.A.defences.Syria.63. The majority of the aircraft have recently been made serviceable by the replacement of engines or parts which were removed soon after the armistice with the object of immobilising them. It is reported that the majority of personnel are to be given indefinite leave owing to the desertion of two aircraft to Palestineduring the first week in September.
Turkey.64. On the 9th September, six Italian seaplanes landed off the Turkish coast.Some of the aircraft and crews were interned, but some escaped.Indo-China.65. The attitude of the French Administration, with regard to Japanesedemands for the use of three aerodromes and the passage of troops to protect them, is influenced by the paucity of their armed forces. The shortage of aircraftremains the chief weakness, and the French authorities are endeavouring toobtain delivery of some 140 modern American aircraft originally purchased bythe French Government and now in the French West Indies.Japan.66. The Japanese have intensified their pressure on the Netherlands east indies to enter into long-term aviation spirit contracts. Appropriate steps arebeing taken to ensure that, while reasonable Japanese demands for netherlands east Indies oil shall be met, nothing avoidable shall be done to render the UnitedStates aviation spirit embargo ineffective.HOME SECURITY.General.67.   Enemy air activity over this country is reported under Air Situation.Damage.Docks.68. The Docks of London, Tilbury and Liverpool have sustained moreattacks than other objectives, and though full details of losses are not yet available,the damage has been serious. Extensive damage, chiefly by fire, has been done ateight of the London Docks.Oil Installations.69. Oil installations were damaged by fire at Thameshaven on the 5thSeptember, and at Purfleet on the 7th September. Thameshaven was again bombedon the night of the 6th/7th September, and a serious fire resulted. Both thesefires are now extinguished. The oil fires at Pembroke Dock and Llandarcy,mentioned in previous Resumes, were extinguished on the 5th September. ThePembroke Dock fire had burned since the 19th August.Railways, Roads and Canals.70. Serious damage has been done to railways in the London area. On thesouth and east of London, terminal stations have been hit and important lines and junctions obstructed. The only main railway lines more or less unaffectedwere those from Paddington, Marylebone and St. Paneras. Euston and King&apos;sCross were affected, but only to the extent of some delay in train services. Repairsare in hand and, unless the same degree of effective damage continues to be:&apos;nflicted, the transport situation should improve fairly rapidly.71. Considerable obstruction of roads has also been reported in the london area. These include Commercial Road, Mile End, Kennington Road, the embankment, King&apos;s Road (Chelsea), and a number of important thoroughfares inthe City of London.72. Damage to canals has occurred at Denton, near Gravesend, and atBanbury.Industry.73.   Aircraft factories have been attacked by day, but serious damage was caused only at Cunliffe Owen Aircraft Factory at Southampton.   Some twenty[21742] c
other industrial factories were attacked and major damage was caused in tencases. A cordite shed was blown up at Messrs. Greenwood and Batley, AbbeyWood; the Dunlop Factory at Rice Lane, Liverpool, was affected to the extentof 50 per cent, loss of production for one week; the Royal Arsenal and Messrs.Siemens Brothers, at Woolwich, have also been seriously damaged.74. Nearly all the factories in Birmingham and Coventry, which in thelast few weeks have sustained serious damage, are back on full production.Gas, Electric Light and Power.75. Six London Power Stations have suffered some degree of damage orinterruption, Fulham and East Ham the most seriously, both of these being seton fire. Those at Stepney and West Ham had to shut down on failure of watersupply. None of the damage under this head, however, has caused more than atemporary failure of electric light or power,76. Serious damage was caused in the afternoon raid on the 7th september to the Gas, Light and Coke Company&apos;s works at Beckton. A large area of EastLondon has, in consequence, been cut off from gas supplies for at least a week.A reduction in gas pressure has also temporarily lowered the output of a group of factories in the Alperton and Wembley district of Middlesex.Public Buildings and Private Property.77. There has been a certain amount of damage to public buildings inLondon, including Somerset House, the Royal Courts of Justice and the royal naval College, Greenwich. A number of hospitals, notably St. Thomas&apos;s andFulham Hospitals, have suffered damage.78. Private property has suffered considerably, particularly in East andSouth London. From the Silvertown area it was necessary to evacuate 2,000people by water, and temporary arrangements have been made for 1,200 homelesspeople from West Ham.Civilian Casualties.79. Casualties for week ending 0600, the 11th September, were 1,211 killed and 5,547 wounded. These figures include 976 killed and 4,149 wounded in theLondon area.,    &apos; ;,Unexploded Bombs.80. Arrangements have been made not only to strengthen the Bomb DisposalSections, but to add to thern a number of trained men who can carry outreconnaissance of the site of reported unexploded bombs. It is hoped that this procedure will save a considerable waste of effort on the part of the sectionsthemselves, who are frequently called to places unnecessarily. (In one area itwas stated that, of 29 unexploded bombs reported after a raid, 28 proved to beincorrect.)81. There has been a report from the North Riding of what may be a dualaction bomb. At Skipton an H.E. bomb exploded at 0200 on the 1st September,and a further explosion occurred more than 24 hours later. A similar doubleexplosion has also been reported to Northern Command from one of the BombDisposal Sections. Llere it was suggested that a 50- and a 250-kilo. bomb were dropped together, attached to each other by wire. The 50-kilo. bomb exploded,and it was assumed that the area was safe. Later the 250-kilo. bomb explodeddeeper down in the crater.Civil Defence Operations.82. Although there have been many oases of direct hits and near misseson shelters of all types, public confidence in them remains high. Indeed, thisconfidence is producing its own problems in the desire of large numbers of people to take their beds and belongings to the shelter every night.
83. A shelter in Columbia Market, Bethnal Green, had a direct hit while some 1,000 people were inside. 162 casualties resulted; whereas, of 600 refugeesin the school which was hit in West Ham, over 200 people were killed, and many more severely injured.84. The Civil Defence Services have been very heavily engaged, and haveendured long hours of very heavy duty with efficiency and cheerfulness. Remark-able examples of skill and determination have been reported from all services,and in at least one area they have been officially thanked for their work by adeputation of members of the public.85. A number of cases have been reported in which factories, though not seriously damaged in raids, have suffered loss of production on the night shiftowing to the fact that blackout precautions (e.g., to the roof) could not bereplaced through lack of material.

Damaged.APPENDIX &apos;YII.; Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports. .THE following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany,Berlin. The drawing department of Siemens factory and the VictoriaWerke, believed to be a chemical factory, in the Tegeler Strasse have been damaged. Hits were also obtained on Neukoeln, the Alexander Platz andHallensee, causing damage to factories and houses.Dortmund. Vereignite Asbestwerke Danco Wetzel has been severely damaged. The warehouses were hit and fired, the loss being estimated at three-quarter million marks.Waldshut. Direct hits were obtained on the chemical factory, whose produc-tion is expected to fall by 50 per cent., and damage was done to neighbouringrailway line.Ludwigshafen. A large factory building near the station has been destroyed.Hamburg. The electric motor works of Gustav Altmann has been damaged.Repairs are expected to take between two and three months.
Railways. The transport of coal and other products between Denmark andGermany is seriously hindered by damage in the neighbourhood of Hamburg aswell as that in the Ruhr. The service between Hanover and Berlin is said to bedisorganised, and passenger services are not operating on the main line between these places. Several railways round Berlin have been damaged and buses are used to co-ordinate the services. On the line between Magdeburg and Dessau aviaduct has been badly damaged and buses are also used at that point.Mining. Intelligence reports continue to testify to the considerable successof our minelaying operations, particularly in Norwegian and Danish waters.France.A petrol depot to the East of Caen has been hit and fired.Holland.The bombing of Leeuwarden aerodrome is reported to have been efficient.During the week one of our aircraft followed German aircraft to their base and attacked it; a munition store was hit and two aircraft were completely destroyed,several more damaged and there were casualties to personnel.Italy.Damage. A detailed report on the effect of the raid of the 14th-15th August,received from a reliable observer in Italy, indicates that the Fiat factory atTurin was more seriously damaged than the Caproni works at Milan. The maindamage, however, is stated to have been caused to buildings : most of the plant was intact, and has been transferred to other shops. Forty-three workers were killed, and the raid achieved an even greater moral effect than usual, as on theprevious day the workers had been lectured by speakers from Rome on England&apos;sexhaustion and impending collapse.Morale. Official restriction of the use of cars during air raids, necessitated by the rush of panic-stricken motorists into the country at the sound of the alarm,provides a further illustration of the evidence that is accumulating from varioussources of the serious effect of Royal Air Force raids on civilian morale.
