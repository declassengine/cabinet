These losses, which amounted inthe aggregate to 110,000 gross tons, include 3 large refrigerated ships ofover 10,000 gross tons each and 3 tankers.No less than 13 of the casualties appear to have occurred in convoy.Two vessels were sunk and one damaged (beached at Kirkwall) by aircraftattack in convoy in one day off Wick, and 2 were sunk by aircraft attackon the 26th, also in convoy, off Kinnaird Head.The move from the Western to the Northern approaches, which was expected to diminish the rate of loss, thus still leaves shipping open to serious depredations.In the four days to which I have referred some exceptionally largeconvoys were at risk, and I do not wish to suggest that the rate of lossthen sustained has become usual.     Nevertheless, even if we take the four weeks ended 25th August as a whole, the losses are seriously disquieting.The losses of British, Allied and Neutral vessels in all seas from enemy action reported in those four weeks amount to 308,000 tons gros3 ywhich is118,000 tons more than in the dangerous first four weeks of the war).The Ministry recognises the great difficulties of providing adequateescorting forces in present circumstances.   But the magnitude of the losses,the demands upon merchant shipping for naval and military purposes, whichhave increased and continue to do so, and the less satisfactory prospects of the building programme are all factors to be taken into account.   Wehave, of course, the use of much allied and neutral tonnage, but the processof arming and degaussing these vessels is slow and many difficulties arisewith their crews so that we have not been getting, and may not get, the full advantage of their importing capacity.Unless the rate of loss can be substantially reduced, all supply departments must seriously revise their expectations of imported supplies.The choice between the competing claims (which include anti-invasionpreparations) for the limited number of escorts available must, of course, bedifficult, but the serious consequences which continued losses of merchant ships at the recent rate entail, suggest that the possibility of securingadditional escort services, even at the cost of some risk in other directions,should be urgently considered.A.S.MINISTRY OP SHIPPING,ff9th August, 1940.
