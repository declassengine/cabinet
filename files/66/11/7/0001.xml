TO BE KEPT^LJN^ KEY, 25It is requested that special care may be taken to &quot; &quot; &apos; -ensure the secrecy of this document^S^CUMgNl-jls.THE.PROPERTY of HIS ERITATJNTQ MAJESTY.&apos; S- -government )secret.P.,(4Q) 327.&apos;..   21ST AUGUST, 1940. COPY NO &apos;WAR cabinet.A.F.  TRAINING.PROPOSAL TO SEND PLYING TRAINING SCHOOLS ABROADMEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.1. I have read with interest the memorandum(V/.P.(40) 323) circulated by the Minister of aircraft production in regard to the proposal to send certainR.A.F.  Schools to the Dominions.      His criticisms fallunder the following heads and I deal with each in sub-sequent paragraphs of this note:-(i)   The increased difficulties due to the shortageof spare parts *(ii)    The divorce of the schools from the aircraft industry.(iii)    The divorce of the schools from the technical staff of the Ministry of Aircraft Production.(iv)    The impossibility of sparing from this countrylarge numbers of mechanics for servicing of aircraft.2. Shortage of Spare Parts.      It is true that theRoyal   Air Force is suffering from a severe shortage of spare parts due to a failure of the makers to deliver toour long-standing requisitions,      Fortunately there are twocircumstances which mitigate this drawbackc      First, the types of aircraft which we propose to send abroad between now and the end of the year are Anj&amp;pns, Battles andpossibly Harvards, all of which are already in use inCanada,  the&quot;latter being an American type;    stocks of spare parts are already in existence, while the Anson andHarvard   are actually being built in that country.Second, though stocks of Anson spares are poor, those forthe Battle and Harvard are good,3* Divorce of the Schools from the Aircraft Industry..This is also a drawback, but, &quot;as I have already mentioned,, theAnson and Harvard are under construction in Canada, v/hile inall three types arrangements have been made by the canadian authorities for a civilian repair organisation for aircraft and for engines.      I hope therefore that assistance may beobtainable comparable to that given by thcindustry in thiscountry./

(Sgd, )     A.H.-M.S.21st August, 1940,4.    - Divorce of Schools from the Technical Staff of -theMinistry of Aircraft Production.     : This&apos; will be unfor tuna te,but&apos; the Royal Canadian Air Force have a skilled though smallstaff.of technicians who will be very ready to help us out ihcase of need.       Moreover the Anson, Battle and Harvard, are all well-tried types,5,. ,   Impossibility of Sparing Mechanics for Servicing, .All schools will be established to carry out their ownservicing, and the Canadian authorities will be ready toassist from their own resources so far as necessary.     four aircraft Repair Depots, of which three will be operatingby October next,, will be available for this purpose,6* The facilities for repair and technical assistance arenot so well developed in South Africa as in Canada, but theywill be extended in connection with the training plan recentlynegotiated by Sir Robert Brooke-Popham with the UnionAuthorities.7. For the foregoing reasons,, I do not share the fears of the Minister in regard to unservlceability of aircraft.While I do not deny that maintenance may be found moredifficult than in this country,  I am convinced that theadvantages to be derived from training in areas free fromoperational restrictions and. enemy air bombardment will faroutweigh any such difficulties.
