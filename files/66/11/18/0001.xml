THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTSECRET. Copy No.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.TRAINING OF R.A.F. PILOTS.I HAVE given a great deal of thought and time to the various Cabinet papers on this subject and have discussed them with the Ministers concerned, and withtheir expert advisers on numerous occasions. I trust it may be possible to reach agreement on the following conclusions :  1. The air battle now proceeding over Great Britain may be a decisiveevent in the war and must dominate all other considerations. Until the issue ofthis battle becomes clear it would not be right to separate any large portion ofour reserve of pilots or of potentially operational machines from the fighting strength of the R.A.F. in this country. We cannot tell what new form theenemy&apos;s attack may take; nor what our losses will be; nor what damage will bedone to our factories both of output and repair. We do not know with any certainty the size of the air force which the enemy may bring against us. It iscertainly very much larger than our own. Therefore the scheme for movinga large part of our training establishments to Canada and South Africa shouldbe postponed; and as uncertainty of date would be inconvenient it would be well to postpone it for three months, i.e., until the beginning of December.2. In the meanwhile every effort should be made to mitigate the evidentdifficulties of training in this Island under present conditions. Sir F. E. Smithhas prepared a note upon R.D.F. congestion which intimates that there is nodifficulty in trainers flying inland. It should be possible to secure, provide orenlarge their facilities for flying over the sea, but this will be undoubtedlyrestricted. Sir F. E. Smith has also mentioned the possibility of using infrared rays for lighting aerodromes for night flying these rays being invisible to anyone not provided with the special glasses that our trainer-pilots would haveto have attached to their helmets. An alternative method is to have severaltraining aerodromes lighted simultaneously to disperse the risks. The impedi-ments to night flying arising from lighted grounds must be considered a veryserious obstacle to training in this country.3. Seventy-five additional air-fields are under construction, and will, it ishoped, be completed by the end of the year. We shall certainly need moreair-fields than this, and another 50 should be at once selected and surveyed.Relief can, however, best be achieved by accelerating the construction of those already begun. I understand from General King, the Chief Engineer of theHome Forces, that large numbers of concrete mixers, and digging machines andcontract labour, can be released in the immediate future from the coastal sectorswhich are now rapidly nearing completion and these will be available for theconstruction of air-field tracks. Some five hundred excavators will be released(most of which will be suitable for work on the aerodromes), while 85 per cent,of the cement mixers used for Home Defence work will be released by the endof October.[21682]
24. In this same three months&apos; interval the utmost effort must be made toget the training establishments in Canada and South Africa ready as far aspossible, and to utilise any local personnel, together with the small detachmentswho have already proceeded to these countries. I consider that the firstNavigation School Unit should proceed to South Africa as now arranged, there being no doubt that practice in navigation is conducted under increasing difficultyat the present time in Great Britain.5. Finally, the whole question must be reviewed at the beginning ofNovember in the light of the fortunes of the battle, and of the progress made in overcoming difficulties obtaining at home.6.   Tables are appended showing (a) The estimated output of pilots under the Air Ministry scheme.(b) The proposed despatch from this Island of men, and(c) Machines.W. s..c.August 26, 1940.
