THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,  September 1940.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 348.September 2, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document/WAR CABINET.REOPENING OF THE BURMA ROAD.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THOUGH no decision is immediately necessary, it may be useful for theCabinet to be reminded of the present position and prospects in regard to theembarrassing question of the Burma Road.The Burma Road Agreement was entered into on the express condition that, during the period of three months that the road is closed to the transportof certain materials, special efforts will be made to bring about a just and equitable peace in the Far East. This period expires on the 17th October, whenHis Majesty&apos;s Government remain free either to continue or to discontinue thepresent partial closure of this route, according to the conditions prevailing atthe time (Foreign Office telegram to Tokyo No. 697 of the 14th July and Tokyotelegram No. 1254 of the 15th July).2. The agreement was signed with the outgoing Minister for ForeignAffairs, Mr. Arita. Sir R. Craigie, at his first interview with the new Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, Mr. Matsuoka, made it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were ready to pursue the same policy of collaboration and friendlysettlement of disputes which they had followed with his predecessors, and inviteda reassuring statement as to Japan&apos;s intentions. To this he received an evasiveanswer, which has not been amplified since then. Subsequent events, coupled with a statement of policy issued by the Japanese Government, seem to show that japan is unlikely, during the period which now remains (less than two months),to express her willingness to discuss a settlement, unless during that period there should be a spectacular change in our favour in Europe. .In the mean-time, she is pursuing the tactics of endeavouring to interpret the Burma RoadAgreement as covering a much wider scope than its terms justify. We have, forexample, been asked to agree that goods in Hong Kong addressed to the ChineseGovernment shall not be forwarded even to Rangoon, and the official of theJapanese Ministry for Foreign Affairs recently sent on a visit to Rangoon has suggested that the categories of goods which are prohibited from crossing thefrontier into China should not be moved into the interior of Burma, that thedetails of the stocks of such goods should be furnished to the Japanese Consul,and that what he called the anti-Japanese movement among the Chinese in Burmashould be suppressed.3.   I assume that it will eventually be the wish of my colleagues to reopen the Burma Road if this can be done without running undue risks.  Public feelinghere is strong, and it will no doubt be difficult to justify the extension of theagreement beyond the stipulated period.  The American public would be equally11157   [21698] B
out of sympathy with us, while the Chinese can be relied upon to stimulateinterest should it show signs of flagging. If we were to reopen the road withoutdue preparation, however, this would be a signal for fresh anti-British agitationon the part of the Japanese extremists, which might force the Japanese Govern-ment to take some kind of face-saving action against us.4. The decision will obviously depend on our war position at the end ofthe intervening period. If we should suffer serious set-backs (for example, in theMiddle East), it follows that our position in the Far East would become more,rather than less, dangerous. In that case the question will have to be considered whether we can afford to reopen the Burma Road when the time comes. that can only be judged in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, but full consideration will have to be given to the reactions here, in America, and in China,of a decision not to reopen the road, and to the extent to which our world position will be further weakened by a tacit admission that we are not strong enoughto insist upon our rights.5. If we succeed in beating off a German attack on Great Britain and itseems reasonable to expect that such an attack must materialise before the middleof October if it is to materialise at all that will be the most powerful influencewe can possibly bring to bear on the Far Eastern situation. The failure ofGerman air attacks up to date to secure their object and to depress our morale,and the losses which the German air force have sustained, are probably alreadynot without effect. There seems, at any rate, to be some hesitation on the partof the Japanese Government in pursuing the aggressive policy of which therewere earlier indications.6. In this uncertain situation the first thing which stands out is that wecannot afford to neglect our defensive precautions, whose urgency has grown no less. We should, in fact, redouble our efforts to place our defences in the Far Eastin a state of preparedness to meet any onslaught which may result from a deterioration in the general situation.7. As regards the Burma Road, we should at once set our minds to the task of so handling the situation in regard to Japan as to leave us, if possible, free to reopen the road if we should decide to do so. To this end we should decline to allow the Japanese to extend the scope of the existing agreement. At the sametime we should try to emphasise to them on every possible occasion its temporarynature, and the fact that it is by no means unconditional, but, on the contrary,involves the fulfilment of an obligation on the part of Japan. This should bedone, not only by Sir R. Craigie in Tokyo, but by us here in London, where wemay hope to use the Japanese Embassy and Japanese correspondents to impressJapan with our point of view.8. Unless we take preparatory action on these lines, there is always thedanger that we may be manoeuvred into a position where the Japanese may makeit appear that, if we do not keep the Burma Road closed to military supplies, weshall ourselves be breaking our undertakings towards Japan. Japanese publicopinion is particularly accessible to a misapprehension of this kind, since it has never been informed of the condition (embodied in a confidential memorandum)that the three months&apos; period should be used for the promotion of a just and equitable peace. The Japanese Government, which has on many occasions sought to influence our judgment by reference to the alleged strong feelings of theJapanese people, would not be slow to build upon such a misapprehension.9. When the date of expiry of the agreement approaches, we should do what we can, though I am not sanguine of success, to deflate public interest and restrainpublicity. Should we decide to reopen the road, we do not want the world to bekeyed up to the point where our return to our previous policy of assistance to china will attract the widest attention. We should, on the contrary, in that event wish traffic to be resumed on the road with as little fuss as possible. we might be able to secure Chinese co-operation in this by pointing out that, if too much attention is attracted in public, we may not be able to reopen the road atall. We should have to tell the Japanese of our decision, and we could saythat, as the conditions of the agreement had not been fulfilled, we felt obliged to resume our liberty of action. Provided it had been possible to create the right atmosphere and to check publicity, the Japanese would not, perhaps,
feel compelled to undertake counter-measures to the same degree that they would if the matter were more widely advertised.10. Lord Lothian, in a recent telegram, of which a copy is appended(Annex 1), recommends us to refuse to keep the Burma Road closed. Hebases this advice on the assumption that the battle of Britain will be overby the time the decision has to be taken and that adequate support willbe forthcoming from the United States. He has reported in another telegramthat the American Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Welles, has offered to discuss what measures of support the United States would give. since then the President and the Secretary of State, Mr. Hull, have expressedinterest in the idea of entering into discussions with His Majesty&apos;s government before a decision becomes necessary on the Burma Road Agreement. In view ofthe election in America it seems very doubtful that any United States authoritycould give any substantial undertaking, but we cannot afford to let these hintspass unnoticed. There is everything to be said for close contact with the UnitedStates Government, provided we do. not build upon obtaining adequate promises of support in advance of any decision which we may have to take here.11. The telegrams which I have sent on this subject to His Majesty&apos;ammbassadors at Washington and Tokyo are attached (Annexes 2, 3 and 4).I also append telegram No. 1716 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo(Annex 5), which crossed my telegrams Nos. 913 and 914 of the 31st August.H.Foreign Office, September 2, 1940.ANNEX 1.The Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Halifax. [Received August 22.)(No. 1783.  Most Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, August 21, 1940.YOUR telegrams Nos. 1965 and 1984.My telegram No. 1780.It seems to me that the oil problem can apparently be dealt with in the lightof larger issues now beginning to emerge. His Majesty&apos;s Government will haveto decide before the middle of October whether it is going to reopen the burma road or not. Fortunately, this decision will probably not have to be taken until after the battle for Britain is over and if, as seems probable, Hitler has by thendefinitely failed either to invade England or to establish a really effective blockade,the whole world position will have changed. From the point of view of theFar East not only will our prestige have increased a great deal, but it mustbecome obvious to the Japanese that at any rate during the winter months, and as our naval increment comes in, it may be possible for us to increase the numberof warships at Singapore and thereby increase risks to themselves of adventuresouthwards. On the other hand, it ought to remove the anxiety which has donemuch to paralyse American policy in the Pacific, [ ? as if] the battle for Britainwent against us the United States might have to bring [ ? main] fleet from the pacific back to the Atlantic.2. In these circumstances it seems to me that the right policy for us to pursue if we can get sufficient American support is to refuse to keep the burma road closed, and to do everything we can to help the Chinese to continue to fightby assisting supplies by that route, by getting the Americans&apos; help to maintainthe Chinese currency and by encouraging Russia to supply China with planes.By far the greatest deterrent to Japanese adventure is China war whichimmobilizes a million men in China and is a constant and increasing intolerabledrain on Japanese economic resources. The second main deterrent is fear ofembroilment with the United States.3.   The success of such a policy from our point of view obviously depends upon United States being willing to act more vigorously in Pacific in support of resistance by ourselves and the Dutch Government to Japanese pressure.  If hope[21698] B 2
of any immediate collapse of China disappears, and if by October the Atlanticsituation enables us with support of the United States Government to take afirmer line in Pacific, then the authority of military party in Japan might begin to be undermined and possibility of getting a Government in Japan which was willing to substitute for aggression a policy of real settlement [ ? group omitted.:between] China and themselves, which is certainly impossible under KonoyeGovernment, might begin to appear.4. Do you agree to my exploiting possibilities of this policy with state department on basis that, if we are to adopt it, it can only be if we know that united States will be willing to give us far more decisive support than it did atthe time of Burma Road crisis in July.5. United States Government will not, of course, enter into commitments which would clearly involve war so long as election is on, but it still has formidableweapons in its hands, It can embargo all raw materials and scrap. It can refuseto buy Japanese silk. By movement of its Fleet it can probably deter Japan fromattacking Hong Kong and from sending any Fleet to Netherlands East Indies:moreover, State Department is convinced that, while Japan will use every methodof bluff and threatens to extend its control, especially where it meets no effectiveresistance, no Japanese Government at present will run the serious risk of getting into war either with British Empire or with United States if Britain wins battlefor Britain or as long as full American Fleet is in Pacific. Therefore, I thinkthat it is possible that United States Government, once it is free from anxiety about Atlantic might well take a much stronger line in our support.6. But if we are to secure more decisive American co-operation to enable us to resist Japanese demands and to help China, it is essential I think thatwe should be prepared, if United States will support us, to make our oil policyand that of Netherlands East Indies conform much more nearly to the American.If United States is to support us it will need support of those powerful elementsinside United States which are anxious to embargo Japan, but who will turnsour if they feel that we and Dutch are nullifying effect of American embargo bysupplying Japan&apos;s deficit from Borneo or Netherlands East Indies.7. If you are disposed to agree to foregoing I think it is of the mostimportance that oil companies should not at present time enter into commitments which are in direct opposition to American policy and that Netherlands Govern -ment should be deterred from exercising pressure upon them to do so.8. Japanese have large reserves of all oils with the possible exception of aviation spirits. The only restriction to-day on purchases from the UnitedStates of America is in respect of aviation spirits and aviation lubricants anddoctored crudes. They can buy as much natural crude or other products as theycan carry from here or South America. Inability to secure aviation spirits andaviation lubricants is not believed to be a critical factor forcing them to take immediate and drastic action. The Japanese seem to be taking advantage of thepresent position to try and force the Netherlands East Indies to enter intocontracts lasting until September 1941 for high grade crude oils from whichaviation spirits can be obtained and to deliver cargoes of high octane petrolitself.9. It seems to me deplorable that the Netherlands Government shouldcommit itself in this way if there is any possibility of our wanting to try and take a stronger line with Japan after the battle for Britain has been won.10. The State Departments view is that the Japanese are largely bluffing.Primary occupation of the Japanese Government is to try and end war with china. There is little risk, especially in view of the speech which the PrimeMinister was able to make yesterday, and unless the battle for Britain goesagainst us, or the United States remove its fleet from the Pacific, or their taking action which might embroil them either with us or with the United States overthe Netherlands East Indies. The general view of the State Department is,therefore, that, while it is advisable to give Japan reasonable supplies of oilsfrom Netherlands East Indies in order not to give too strong an argument tohot-heads, that we and the Dutch should refuse to be rushed or to bind ourselvesfor any long periods until the situation described in the earlier part of this telegram has been cleared up.
11. Therefore, I feel strongly that the companies should not increase theirsales to Japan from Netherlands East Indies of high-grade crudes and that under no circumstances should they sell high octane petrol itself, which would be indirect opposition to the policy of the United States Government. Surelyargument that the whole output of high octane oils is for Empire requirements is a strong one, and any withdrawal from this position would be an added sign of weakness.12. Standard Vacuum are seeing the State Department to-morrow and areexpected to take the position that, if the Netherlands Government insist, theymust sell crude oil to Japanese or to Shell which will enable the latter to deliverto the Japanese. Mr. Wilkinson therefore expects he will be forced to obey his instructions and forward to Yokohama to-morrow Companies&apos; proposals, which include at least two cargoes of aviation petrol from B.P.N. For this, see my telegram No. 1780.(Advance copy sent to Petroleum Department.)ANNEX 2.Viscount Halifax to Sir R. Craigie [Tokyo).(No. 913.   Very Confidential.)(Telegraphic.) &apos; Foreign Office, August 31, 1940.LESS than two months now remain before the Burma Road Agreement isdue to expire, and we have been considering what steps we should take to meetthe situation which will arise at the end of that period.2. Nothing has happened since your interview with Mr. Matsuoka on the27th July (see your telegram No. 1342), to suggest that the Japanese Governmentare seriously prepared to fulfil their part of the bargain. Public opinion here is so roused over the question that it will be difficult to justify the extension of theagreement beyond the stipulated period. The American public is out of sympathy with us on this subject, while the Chinese can be relied upon to stimulate interestshould it show signs of flagging.3. Our decision will obviously have to depend on our war position at the endof the intervening period. If we should suffer serious set-back our position in theFar East would become more, rather than less, dangerous, and it may well be thatin any case the situation will not have cleared sufficiently to permit us to disregard the consideration that led us to accept present compromise.4 On the other hand, failure of Germany either to make full-scale attackon Great Britain or to succeed in one if it is made, would presurnabty have a powerful influence on the Far Eastern situation, and might render it easier forus to reopen the Burma Road.5. To do so without due preparation, however, would doubtless be the signalfor fresh anti-British agitation in Japan, which might compel the JapaneseGovernment to take some kind of face-saving action against us.6. Our aim must, therefore, be so to handle the situation as to allow themaximum freedom of action, and the instructions contained in my immediately following telegram are designed to attain this end.7. I feel that unless preparatory action on these lines is taken there is a danger that we may be manoeuvred into a position where the Japanese may makeit appear that, if we do not keep the Burma Road closed to military supplies, weshall ourselves be breaking our undertakings towards Japan. Japanese publicopinion will be particularly accessible to a misapprehension of this kind, since ithas never been made officially aware of the condition attached to the Burma RoadAgreement
8. I should add for your information that Lord Lothian in a recenttelegram recommended that we should refuse to keep the Burma Road closed.He bases his recommendation on the assumption that the Battle of Britain willbe over by the time the decision has to be taken, and that adequate support willbe forthcoming from the United States. In another telegram he reports thatMr. Welles has indicated his willingness to discuss what measures of supportthe United States would give. More recently both the President and Mr. Hullhave expressed interest in the idea. In view of the American election it seems doubtful whether any United States, authority could give any substantial under-taking, and though we shall respond to Mr. Welles&apos;s suggestion, we are notallowing ourselves to rely upon obtaining from the United States adequatepromises of support in advance of any decision we may have to take here.(Repeated to Shanghai, No. 912; Washington, No. 2093; Chungking (bycable), No. 74; Rangoon, No. 787; and Hong Kong, No. 98.)ANNEX 3.Viscount Halifax to Sir R. Craigie (Tokyo).(No. 914.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, August 31, 1940.MY immediately preceding telegram.There is a danger of the broad issues involved in the Burma Road question being obscured by a mass of detail. In any further conversations with theJapanese Government therefore you should, as opportunity offers, develop thefollowing general line : (1) The spirit of the agreement is to forbid the transit of certain articles,but to place no obstacle in the way of traffic in non-prohibited goods.(2) The agreement is temporary and does not therefore justify measures designed to forbid the accumulation of stocks in Burma.(3) The Japanese are trying to expand the agreement in various ways,incompatible with its general spirit and, in particular, with (1) and(2) above.(4) What are the Japanese doing for their part to fulfil their side of the bargain ?(Repeated to Shanghai, No. 913; Washington, No. 2094; Chungking (bvcable), No. 75; Angora, No. 788; and Hong Kong, No. 99.)ANNEX 4.Viscount Halifax to the Marquess of Lothian (Washington).(No. 2095.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, August 31, 1940.YOUR telegrams Nos. 1783, 1790 and 1837 [21st, 22nd and 26th August:Burma Road].We warmly welcome interest shown by the President, Mr. Hull andMr. Welles. My telegram No. 913 to Tokyo will show the general way in which our minds are working. It is obviously in our interest to respond to suggestion of discussion with United States Government, and as a preliminary step it wouldbe useful if you could ascertain whether Mr. Welles has at present in mind anyparticular form of support.
ANNEX 5.Sir R. Craigie to Viscount Halifax. (Received August 31.)(No. 1716.  Important.)(Telegraphic.) Tokyo, August 30, 1940.BURMA Road Agreement.Nearly half of the three months&apos;period having now elapsed, we should perhapsbegin to consider what is to happen on the 18th October. It is devoutly to be hoped by that date the situation will be such that we can refuse to renew our agreement without incurring the risk of war or precipitating that southwardadvance by Japan which it is our purpose to avoid.2. It would be idle to maintain that a blank refusal to renew will not throwthe maximum strain on our relations with Japan. For facilitating that situation with reasonable assurance there are three prerequisites : (a) Danger of imminent German invasion of Britain should have been avertedand the certainty of early British air ascendency established.(&amp;) There should be promise of support from the United States and possibly also from the U.S.S.R. in the event of the refusal to renew involving usin an armed clash with Japan.(c) We must be in a position to demonstrate not only that certain Japaneseauthorities have met our concession last, month by instigating an intensive anti-British agitation in Japan but that the JapaneseGovernment themselves have failed to respond to our proposal forexploring the possibilities of a &quot; general settlement&quot; which was anessential part of our original offer.3. By the 18th October the position as regards (a) should be sufficiently clear to convince even the Japanese Government. Hope of securing (6) ispresumably slender, but perhaps His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Washington and moscow could be considering what, if any, approach should be made to the UnitedStates and the Soviet Government at the appropriate moment. (The possibilityof the Soviet Government double-crossing us with the Japanese must presumablybe taken into account.)4. As regards (c), our justification for refusing the renewal would be stronger if the Japanese Government had meanwhile definitely declined even toconsider with us the question of a general settlement. Proposal to discuss sucha settlement has not yet been put to the present Japanese Government partly because the situation has been so unpromising, and partly because I have not yet received your final instructions; but I should like to raise this point with theMinister for Foreign Affairs early in September. [ % In case] he enquires whether his Majesty&apos;s Government have any concrete suggestions to offer, I should be grateful if before then I could know your views on the suggestions put forward in my telegrams Nos. 1241 and 1045. Minister for Foreign Affairs himself willtake no initiative in this connexion, and I am not sanguine of any satisfactoryresult even if the proposals are put forward from our side; but I should beprepared with a reasonably definite reply if the Minister for Foreign Affairs asks for particulars and promises careful consideration at the hands of the JapaneseGovernment.(Repeated to Shanghai, No. 674; Washington, No. 186; Moscow, No. 19;Shanghai, pass Hong Kong as No. 304; Hong Kong, pass Singapore as No. 143;Singapore, pass Rangoon as No. 100.)
