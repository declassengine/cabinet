Morale. Morale and discipline amongst the French officers and menwho have joined the Royal Navy are distinctly better than in the Free french force. There is a growing tendency for the latter to ask to be transferred to theRoyal Navy. This is embarrassing, as the Admiralty, in order to give every encouragement to Admiral Muselier, have laid down that once officers and men have decided to join the Free French Force they will not be allowed, except under very special circumstances, to change over to us.7. French Officers and Men aivaiting Repatriation in Camps. With betterconditions and smaller camps the morale and discipline of the men are steadilyimproving. The attitude of the officers is much the same as before, and on thewhole they are not helpful. There is a small but steady flow of volunteers amongthe men, about fifteen a day, to join General de Gaulle.General de Gaulle&apos;s representatives in the vicinity of the camps are now received without hostility.Arrangements were made for Lord Derby and Mr. Justice Avory to meetthose French officers billeted at Blackpool.   The meeting was a cordial one.The following letter to the Commodore of Skegness Camp (H.M.S. RoyalArthur) from the Senior French Officer of 600 Meknes survivors, who were temporarily accommodated there, testifies to the care taken of these people inBritish Naval Establishments :  (Translation.)&quot; My dear Commodore,I want to express to you the thanks of all the French officers and menwho have been received at the Royal Arthur camp.We were most touched by the very cordial and comforting welcome givento us by you and your officers after the Meknes disaster.I would like particularly to thank Commander Hillyer for the attentionhe has given us, and your medical staff for their devoted care of our sick.Please allow a veteran of the Great War, who learned in the Dardanelles,the North Sea and the Adriatic, to appreciate the great qualities of his British
comrades, amongst whom he has many friends, to express to you his gratitudeand his profound hopes for the victory of your country.As for me myself, I have been very conscious of the friendliness you haveshown to me, and it would give me great pleasure in my turn to receive you in France.(ii) Army.8.Alder shot.(a) Strength  Officers.

These three Brigade Cadres (3rd, 4th and 5th) will be commandedrespectively by General Zajac, General Langner and Colonel Giza.

Arrangements for the use of rifle and artillery ranges are being discussed.Attachments. The attachment of 108 Polish Officers and 90 other ranks to various units of the British Army began to-day.

The morale is high, except in the case of the surplus officers,who are still suffering from lack of occupation and the fear that they may never be employed.When every possible place has been filled, and after the removal of those unfit for service for whatever reason, there will still be a surplus of a least 1,000 officers for whom it will be possible to find employment only in special units, such asarmoured trains, cavalry squadrons, and in other specialised occupations.(i) Pay.
