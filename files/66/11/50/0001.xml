This Memorandum sets out the Army programme up to the Spring ox Outline1942 as I now envisage it and it may be taken as the War Office corollary tothe Minister of Supply&apos;s Memorandum W.P. (40) 33^. I should, however, explainat the outset that, although what we may be able to do is governed mainly bythe availability of equipment and, although what, operationally, we conceive     &quot;to be both desirable and practicable is based on assumptions of which somecannot be more than intelligent guesses, I have thought it useful to set out inone document the nearest approach to a comprehensive military plan that can -at the moment be framed.2. Since for some time to come the limiting factor will be supplies, I will the review the equipment situation first.   The Minister of Supply has furnished Equipmentforecasts, in respect of certain key items of equipment, of the supplies which bltuatl0nare likely to be available by Z plus 27, and estimates of the monthly rate ofproduction at that date.  These figures are given with all reserve and there are numerous factors e.g., very considerable interruption of production, destructionof factories and stores, shortages of machine tools or of raw materials whichmight upset them to a greater extent than can at present be foreseen, but theydo not take much credit for American production which I hope by that datewill have assumed considerable proportions.  I therefore feel that we may baseour recruiting programme and our operational plans on the assumption that the forecast deliveries will be realized.   We should not be justified in counting ontheir being exceeded and we must be prepared for circumstances at presentunforeseen necessitating some modification of these plans.I have assumed that the production of items of equipment other than thosekey items will at least match the key items which therefore are assumed to set the pace as regards equipment of Divisions.On the basis so described, I estimate that we shall be able to equip and tomaintain in action a force of 50 Divisions by the Spring of 1942.By 50 Divisions, I mean 45 Infantry Divisions and armoured formationsequivalent to 5 Armoured Divisions and 10 Army Tank Brigades. (If ourArmoured Fighting Vehicles are grouped into more Divisions and fewer ArmyTank Brigades, then a larger number of Divisions might exist but that wouldbe due merely to a redistribution of our assets).That estimate is, I believe, a reasonably conservative one on the forecasts of deliveries and on such anticipations as I can make now of the maintenancerequirements in the next 18 months. It is likely that there will be shortages incertain types of equipment below the ideal scale [e.g., Medium Artillery and anti-Tank weapons) but, on the figures given, my advisers do not consider thatthese shortages would be such as to necessitate the withholding of Divisionsotherwise fully equipped and trained.A special word should be said about Tanks:  On the forecasts of home production we shall not have, ^sufficient Cruisers and Infantry tanks to make up 5 Armoured Divisions and % Army Tank Brigades or, as the Prime Ministerwishes, 10 Armoured Divisions-by Z plus 27.  The deficiency in the latter case
might be 600 or 700 but against that we have the promised deliveries of theAmerican M 3 Tank which if realized would at least make good the deficiency; by the Spring of 1942. Nevertheless we shall clearly have nothing to spare underthe most favourable conditions and 10 Armoured Divisions is all too little undermodern conditions of warfare and in relation to the enemy&apos;s probable strength inA.F.V. by that date. If any shortages of material or other causes were to impede the tank production here or in U.S.A. our position would be serious. It istherefore all the more disturbing that present production of Cruiser Tanks isvery low. Infantry Tanks are in no sense a substitute for Cruisers since theycan have only the most limited role in the Middle East.In making this estimate I am assuming that some limited issues of equip-ment to Dominions and Allies will be necessary, but there is little prospect of our being able to give them substantial further assistance in Anti-Aircraft Guns and anti-Tank Weapons for some time, save at the expense of our own military effort.The 50 Divisions I have mentioned represent the maximum number of divisions that I consider we should be wise to count on by the Spring of 1942,but, as explained hereunder, I am proposing to base my recruiting plans and tostate the Army&apos;s man-power requirements on a rather more optimistic basis, sothat, if the equipment situation makes possible 55 Divisions by the Spring ofMriij: \. 1942, the supply of trained men will be adequate. In the force of 55 Divisionsthere would be, as I envisage it, 34 purely British Divisions (see para. 4. below).The 3- As the man-power requirements depend upon the nature and extent of strategic operations, I will deal next with operational plans on the assumption that theallocation  SUpp]y 0f men wiil be adequate.available CCS. (40) 683 gives as the troops required for the security of our overseasland forces possessions (excluding the Dominions and India and internal security troops)21 Divisions allocated as follows : -rail if;&quot; .Middle East (including 2 Armoured Divisions)  and africa (4 Brigade Groups) the equivalent of reserve for the Middle East...      ...  .......      ...Reserve for Iraq and Iran   ...      ...       ...West11 Divisions3 -3Total for the Middle East17Far EastIceland31Total21(Defended Ports Abroad and Internal Security Troops are not regardedas part of the 55 Divisions for operational purposes, and I have allowed forthe equipment of these troops in addition to the equipment of the Divisions.)We have at the present time in these theatres the following troops (expressedroundly in Divisions although they are not in all cases organized as such orequipped to full scale) :Middle East (including 1 Armoured Division) with East africa and West Africa the equivalent of    ...      ...      ...       ...   6 DivisionsReserve for Middle EastReserve for Iraq and Iran ...Far East       ...       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       ...   1Iceland ...       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   18We are making up the equipment and reserves in the Middle East to fullscale as a matter of equal urgency with Home Defence requirements. That is tosay 50 per cent, of new production in those items of equipment which the middle east requires is being sent to the Middle East. Reinforcements to the extent of2 Divisions (1 Armoured) are proceeding from this country and the Dominions tothe Middle East in the next two months and from India to the Middle East tothe extent of 1 Division. That leaves a balance of 10 Divisions to achieve theChiefs of Staff requirement for the security of the overseas Empire.
- We should clearly provide that balance as soon.as possible but that is.not.thelimit of. our liabilities for overseas operations in theatres other than NorthWestern Europe. In W.P. (40) 353-Para. 5-the Prime Minister, has expressedthe opinion that for operations in the countries therein. mentioned (the middle eastern theatre) we should have 27 Divisions 15 British,&quot;6 Australasian and 6Indian. That is 10 more Divisions than the Chiefs of Staff suggest for defensive purposes and, since this theatre offers the best prospects of early offensive action,I should hope to see these divisions made available for that purpose.In addition, therefore, to our needs for Home Defence and apart from anyrequirements for &quot; continental&quot; operations, we must have 31* Divisions for thesecurity of our overseas possessions and to provide an adequate striking force inthe Middle Eastern theatre.The date by which that particular objective can be attained depends upon (a) The supply of equipment;\b) Shipping and port facilities in the Middle East; and(c) The requirements for Home Defence.It is difficult to state what will be the minimum requirements fcr HomeDefence at any given date. In addition to A.D.G.B. and the Coast Defences itis our aim to use Home Defence units, holding battalions, young soldiersbattalions and the Home Guard to the maximum extent possible but we shall certainly need in addition some fully equipped, mobile field formations. Untilthe end of 1941 it is difficult to see how those extra requirements could be put at less than the higher of the two figures envisaged (by implication) by the Chiefsof Staff in para. 250 of COS. (40) 683, viz., 14 divisions. In 1942 when it ishoped tiiat we &quot;shall be sufficiently near to having an air superiority which permitsof our maintaining a force in North Western Europe the figure will be less. Itmay be as low; as the 4 divisions which is the.lesser of the figures envisaged inthe paragraph of C.O.S. (40) 683 already referred to though this is not at alllikely; it may be-somewhat higher,  or the purpose of the man-power calcula-tions to which I come later in this paper it has been taken as 7 divisions.The conclusions I have reached, therefore, are that:  (a) By June, 1941, we will not have been able to do more than (i) Equip and maintain the 21 Divisions referred to in para. 3 above;(ii) Equip and provide reserves for the troops required for HomeDefence; and(iii) Provide equipment on a training scale for the additional Divisionsby then in course of formation;(&amp;) Between June, 1941 and the Spring of 1942 we should be able to meetthe maintenance requirements of the Middle East forces and provide some divisions towards the additional 10 required for offensive operations in that theatre;(c) By the Spring of 1942 we should have available trained  and fully equipped (except as regards possibly Anti-Tank Guns and medium artillery), 50 divisions in all, i.e. 29 more than the 21 of (a) (i) above.These would be equipped on a scale and with reserves permittingtheir employment anywhere overseas though a certain number (7 on my working hypothesis) of them would in fact have to be kept for thedefence of this country; and(d) The rate of supply of equipment by the Spring of 1942 should be appreciably more than is required for the maintenance of 50 Divisionsor even of 55 Divisions ; therefore, if the supply of men is adequate,an increase of our Army beyond 55 Divisions should be possible andwe should have some supplies of equipment available for potentialallies.4. Although the production estimates do not quite justify the expectation The Man-that 55 fully equipped Divisions will be possible by the Spring of 1942, and, Poweralthough, as indicated above, I feel that it is wiser to frame our operational plans Situation* Note. i.e. 27 Middle East.3 for Far East.1 for Iceland.(6198)
on 50 Divisions being available by that date, I am proposing to make: my plans for recruitment on the basis that 55 Divisions may then be attainable and thatsome expansion of the Army beyond 55 Divisions will be possible and desirable.When I speak of 55 Divisions, I refer to the Field Force. In addition to theField Force, of course, are the troops required for Defended Ports, Garrisons and internal Security troops abroad, the Training Units and Establishments arid theHome Defence Units and Holding Battalions at home, Air Defence, and coast defence of Great Britain, and. the Allied Troops (Poles, Dutch, French, etc.,which may amount to some 30,000).The Field Force of 55 Divisions would probably be composed as follows :-BritishCanadian    ...Australian  ...New zealand south Africa*India...African Colonies34331194Total ...      ...      ...      55To provide the supply of trained men necessary for a Field Force of 34British Divisions with some reserves to make good deficiencies in Australasian,L. of C. and ancillary troops, I propose to recruit from within the United kingdom on the following plan, unless, meantime, the equipment or strategic situationnecessitates some modification:lies some moumcauuu .September, 1940, to March, 1941, inclusiveApril, 1941, to October, 1941, inclusive300,000!700,0001,000,000From October, 1941, onwards, if a force of 55 Divisions as described above is to be maintained, an average monthly intake of between 120,000 and 150,000British troops may be required for some months to build up a reserve of trained men for the replacement of casualties during a period of intense fighting, and thereafter to ensure an average monthly output from Training establishments,sufficient to maintain the strength of units. After about 6 months this total would be reduced by the casualties who again become fit for service, but itwould be unwise at this stage to count on an average monthly intake lower than100,000 whilst active operations continued.The total of 1,060,000 by October, 1941, would provide rather more than isrequired for the British quota of the whole of the land forces by that date, but1 consider this insurance is necessary because it is uncertain that the Dominionsand India can provide the whole of the non-Divisional troops for their quota,even allowing for a proportion of &quot; ancillary &quot; troops for a theatre such as theMiddle East being recruited from native labour.The rate of intake would be.graduated so as to reduce to the minimum the drain on productive labour in this country, consistent with ensuring that there isa supply of trained men fully adequate for the equipment we can reasonablyhope to have and consistent also with avoiding, so far as possible, an excessivenumber of men under individual training in the winter months when accommo-dation for troops in this country is most difficult.There may, for a time, be a shortage of rifles we will be dependent to aConsiderable extent on&apos;U.S.A! production and I hope that Sir Walter Layton willbe able to clarify this situation at a very early date. The extent to which we. require, or. to which it will be sound to lay down, more rifle making plants in thiscountry depends largely on this and Sir Walter Layton is weir aware of theimportance and urgency of the issue. ;* There is some doubt as to whether India will be able to have more than 7 Divisions fully equipped and trained by the spring of 1942,. but it is not unreasonable to assume that we may havethe equivalent of 2 Divisions of Allied&quot; troops by that date.
5. Apart from destruction of stocks or interruption of production by enemy Priorityaction, there are two factors which might seriously upset the production forecasts ^bouron which my estimates in paras. 2, 3 and 4 above are based:(a) Priority for supplies other than those required for the Army; and(b) A shortage of skilled labour arid a lag in the process of dilution.If an overriding priority is given to Aircraft production a priority which covers the raw materials and machine tools required for the maximum possible produc-tion of Aircraft; both here and in the U.S.A., it is quite clear that the Minister ofSupply&apos;s forecasts will not be realized in many key items of equipment, of whichTanks would certainly be an example.As regards the supply of Skilled labour and the acceleration of dilution, Iendorse most strongly the Minister of Supply&apos;s remarks in Part IX of his paper on the Munitions Situation. Although the War Office may be able to reducesome of their requiremenjsjorn^^^ (this is being actively pursued at themoment) it seems &quot; Fear thaTfiSn^purcEases from U.S.A. or Canada of vehicleswhich they can deliver reasonably quickly would, if the purchases were suffi-ciently large, be a most valuable aid to the freeing of skilled men in this countryfor production without delaying (and even possibly accelerating) the equipment of the Army with its necessary transport.6. One further point must be mentioned, viz., the suggestion in Lord Army AirBeverbrook&apos;s paper (W.P. (40) 360) that there should be a separate Army Air ArmArm. Discussions have been proceeding for some time on the problem ofsecuring adequate air support for the Army. The Air Ministry accept the position that close support is essential and as appears from para. 271 of C.O.S. (40) 683they are making provision for the necessary types of aircraft. But they have notyet agreed to the Army having an absolute first call on such close supportsquadrons as are to be provided. This is of course an essential for the properfunctioning of any military forces in the field and in addition presupposesthat these squadrons are fully trained with the Army for their role. On theother hand I do not feel able in present circumstances to go as far as LordBeverbrook wishes, though, in theory, I am sure that he is right. We couldnot, starting from scratch, raise, train or maintain an Army Air Arm before 1942at the earliest and we must therefore count on the co-operation of the Air Ministry.But if. the full issue of a separate Army Air Arm is not to become a burningone now we must have the assurance that our vital needs will be fully met.7. I do not pretend that the extent of our military effort as indicated above conclusion is all that we could wish, but, as I see it, it is not capable of improvement unlessthe equipment position improves. If the latter does improve, then we have somemargin in our programme of recruitment to enable us to take advantage of it without loss of time and anyhow we can always increase at fairly short notice the rate of recruitment.As from the Spring of 1942, the anticipated output of equipment should besufficient to make possible the creation of further Divisions in addition to themaintenance of existing Divisions, but it is impossible to say at this stage whatwould be possible without risking an overdraft on our man-power assets.What is quite clear is that man-power considerations will prevent us frombuilding up an Army much larger than this paper contemplates, and we must therefore concentrate on bringing a force of this modest dimension to the highestpitch of fighting efficiency. Everything that can be done in this direction we certainly shall do.A. E.The War Office,14th September, 1940.P.S. Since the above was written, the possibility of considerable accretionsto the French Free forces has become apparent and, while it is not yet possibleto assess with any degree of accuracy the ultimate strength of these forces andtheir requirements of equipment, I have been told that a minimum of 3 Divisions-may be expected while it might rise to 10 Divisions. While presumably most ofthese troops have their initial equipment, there are, I believe, only small stocks
so that the provision of. equipment for maintenance is a problem that has to be tackled. The War Office are in close touch with Major Mortons Committee and enquiries as to what the U.S.A. can do in the ^provision of French types of equip-fnent have been instituted by the Ministry of Supply. To the extent, however,that these troops have to be provided with equipment from here or from U.S.A.some slowing down in the rate of equipment of our own troops may be involved.When the position is clearer priority decisions will have to be taken, but I thinkit is right to refer to this factor in this general review of the situation.(B40/8)   100   9/40   W.O.P.   6198
