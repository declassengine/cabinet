Cabinet.2. During the first year of the war,  theallied and neutral shipping incurred through all formsenemy; attack was almost the same as the average annuallosses of British,oflossduring the four years of thebe guided in the main by thehas been suffered during the j_s.sc two orperiod, attack by submarine and from the at sea,  the E boat has shown itself,  andla st, war., .accentuated&quot;I a a &apos;h   &quot;H, We must, however,rate of loss whichthree months.      In that air has been; intensifiedshipping is now being:subjected to bombardment from the air while it lies in port.3o For the purposes of estimating our importing capacityduring.the second year of the war, the Ministry of Shippingexpressed the. view recently that we should assume that ou*&quot; total losses including marine casualties would, during that period, beof the order of 5 million gross tons.      The Naval Staff have pointed out that if our losses, exclusive of marine casualties,were to continue at the rate suffered in June and July over aperiod of a year,  they would amount to between %\% and 6 million grosstons.-ho War losses alone during the last three months have, been as follows % -Losses of Merchantexcluding mapifoe casualtxes) /opriofl&apos; Tune(gross tons)^^-CalendarMonth.(including tankers, butAugust,  1940.JuneJulyAugustBritish267 .00021+4,000255,000Allied andneutral2au. .CGC111 \ 00072,000In addition, during this period 117?0.00 grossshipping has been lost while on commissionedTotal.511,000355,000327s000tons of merchant service.
5o We are informed, by the Controller of Merchant Shipbuildingthat the present rate of m reliant shipbuilding is not likely toreach more than 1 million gross tons during the next year, ascontrasted with the target of 1 -g- million gross tons to be attained by February next under the arrangements made when theresponsibility for merchant shipbuilding was transferred fromthe Ministry of Shipping to the Admiralty in the early partof this year0      This reduced rate of construction represents areduction of no less than one-third and., even so, may make,insufficient allowance for adverse effects due to damage to the  &apos;/shipyards or to prolonged Interruption of work as the result of enemy attacko6a It is obviously a matter of grave consideration whetherthis reduced rate of merchant shipbuilding can be accepted inview of the increased rate of Xom which we are forced to envisageas compared with that prevailing six months agoo7o The Ministry of Shipping has purchased, mainly from theUnited States, some hO vessels and is in negotiation for 6additional ships at the moment o      It is anticipated that the unexpendedportion of the sum already made available by the Treasury shouldbe sufficient to defray the cost of these vessels      The opportunities for purchase, however, are limited and the vessels acquired are 20years old or more,      It would be unwise to buy vessels which have :not been in service as they might well prove not only very : .costly but extremely inefficient*      Purchase of tonnage ofthis type is in any oase merely a stop-gap, war measure whichwill, leave us after the war Kith oil .3 expensive, and inefficient .* -tonnage which will have to be rapidly scrapped.; and does, nothing .to replace the British Mercantile Marine, of which the -average again all section is already too high,-      Notwithstanding these considerationwe think &quot;that any opportunity of acquiring serviceable ships at reasonable prices should continue to be taken,.      The tonnage hithertobought has cost on the average about I1.5 to 50 dollars a dead-weight . t oho8b New construction in the United iSt-ateSoi      Construct! on oftonnage in the United States was put &quot;rapidly in hand in the later  .stages of the last war and was brought to a high rate of output3We consider it essential that our programme of home constructionshould be supplemented, by the immediate placing in the UnitedStates of as substantial an order for new tonnage as can be laid -down in the near future * and preliminary inquiries have been madeas to the possibilities6      It may be practicable to place ordersfors say? 60 ships of 10,000 tens deadweight with United States,yards for delivery at the end of 19U10      The Controller of merchantship building thinks that it would be unduly optimistic to look for any earlier date of delivery.     We recognise that the- cost- ofthis tonnage must be high., but our wastage of shipping must be made good.      An expenditure of 520 million of which not more than  5 million would be required before the 31st March would be necessaryfor the. acquisition of this tonnagei      The Chancellor of theExchequer has definitely agreed to orders being placed for 30 1ships-in order that the immediate negotiation? may be undertaken,,
9. We are also of opinion that negotiations should hepursued v/ith a view, to &apos; securing the transfer- of vesselsalready under construction in the United States to ourselves.There may he at. the moment some political&apos; -difficulties&apos; in persuading&apos;the United States -authorities .to agree to &quot;suchtransfer of&apos;contracts already placed &quot;by the Maritime&apos;Commission and special inquiries are &quot;being made upon thispoint.      Insofar as-any such transactions could.he carried through, we should gain the advantage, of earlier delivery,&apos;;though,., of course, we should have to undertake to meet -thecost of replacing at a latex&quot; date4 the vessels ceded to us.10B       Let us assume that we shall he successful in securingsome 15 months hence about -h.00,000 tons gross of shippingconstructed in the United Sta.tes, together with perhapsanother 100,000 tons gross of old ships purchased in themarketo      On this &quot;basis, if our own programme remains at thelevel of 1 million gross tons per1 annum and if the rate of loss over the period amounts to something of the order of5 million tons gross from all sources, we shall he replacingonly 50 per cent., of our losses.      This we consider quite inadequate.11o        The only other way of making good the wastage in tonnage is to increase our home programme.      The Admiraltyareof the opinion that, in existing conditions, any increasein the rate of merchant shipbuilding above about 1 million gross tons could only be secured, at the expense of the naval programme or by .some allocations of steel and other- lightmaterials in excess-of the amounts allotted to the merchantship building programme tinder existing- priority decisions,12.     . There are further difficulties in securing suitablelabour for the necessary marine engineering output for merchant shipbuilding purposes?13.      : So far as steel is concerned, -we would remind theWar Cabinet .that every ton of steel employed In shipbuildingyields a .return in deadweight carrying capacity equivalentto an importing power of 12 -cons, of goods per annum.     Wethink that every effort should be made to increase the home production sxibstantially above the level of 1 million tonsand to bring the rate ox&quot; construction at least to the rateof       million tons gross per annum by the early part of nextyear, and that the necessary requirements which the controller of Merchant Shipbuilding puts forward should receive themost favourable consideration,,1h..o       If further inquiry, as to the possibilities of construc-tion In the United States prove disappointing,  the whole situation of our home production will obviously have to befurther considered as a matter of the roost vital importance.15,&apos;      We do not overlook the possibility that under thesystem of Navicerts and-Ships Warrants we may yet be ableto induce or force into our service additional neutral shipping, but there are many difficulties in the use of neutral and even allied shipping which cannot be ignored,We need only refer to the recent action of the Greek
Government in withdrawing, under German pressure j all official&apos;support from G-rSeK shipowners in enforcing the&apos;observance of existing agreements concerning war &quot;bonus for Greek crews - astep which may lead to substantial delays in the sailingof these ships, and to reluctance to charter except atextravagant rates.     We have also in mind the probability of increasing demands upon merchant shipping for the mamn-tenahce of theferbes in the Middle East and other essential .naval and military operations^     We think it essential to restore, as far as possible, our actual losses by thecreation of hew tonnage over which we have absolute controlrather than to rely upon bringing into our service tonnageover which we have no such absolute control, and which inpresent circumstances we can only secure by negotiation andpressure.j^unmarv^16. We recommend:-(a) that our programme for the building ofmerchant shipping in this country should if possible be raised at least to the rateof 1^ million gross tons per annum;(b) that immediate steps be taken to increase our merchant tonnage;(i)(ii)(iii)(c)      that the construction of a further 30 shipsadditional to those referee! to in (b)  (i)above shall be considered not later thanNovember, 1940 in the light of the circum-stances then existing, or at an earlier date,if in the opinion of the Admiralty and theMinistry of Shipping either increased lossesor increased demands for shipping make this necessary.I I/(by placing orders at once in theUnited States for the constructionof another 30 ships each of 10,000dead weight tons (a total of, say,200f000 gross tons);&apos;by securing (if no political objectionsprevent it) ships already partlycompleted for the United StatesMaritime Commission;    these, to bereplaced by ships to be constructedunder (j.) above;by the purchase by the Ministry ofShipping, as opportunity offers,of serviceable second hand shipsso long as these are obtainableat reasonable prices;Intd0) AcGo&quot;       ) X0W0&quot;    ) AoVoA,) RoHoCnTreasury Chambers, S.W.1.,9th September, 1940.
