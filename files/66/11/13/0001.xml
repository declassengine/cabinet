(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; SGOVERNMENT)to be kept under lock and keySECRETW.P.(40) 55525rd  August 1940,t is requested that special cafe may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINE&apos;CopyFAR EASTERN situation memorandum by the Secretary of State for India andfor Burma.In paragraph 51 of the Chiefs of StaffsAppreciation of the Par Eastern Situation^ the Chiefs ofStaff contemplated that both the long and short term problems of the defence of Burma will be reviewed by theGovernments oi India and Burma in consultation with the -Air Officer Commanding in the Par East.   A full summaryof this Appreciation has been telegraphed to theGovernment of India and is being communicated by them tothe Government of Burma.I have received a telegram dated 17th August fromthe Governor-General of India (drafted without referenceto the summary and presumably before its text was avail-able to him) in which he suggests that a joint Conferenceof representatives of all the Services from India, burma and Malaya should be convened at a very early date,perhaps in Burma, to co-operate in a comprehensivestrategical plan for defence against a possible Japanesethreat to those countries.   With the concurrence of the that thisStaffsofSecretary of State for the Colonies I askproposal, which accords with the Chiefs of intention, should be approved in principle, ana that weshould be authorised to inform the Governments concerned to that effect.The Governor-General has further asked that instructions should be given as to who is to beresponsible for the co-ordination of plans and forultimate operational control, and also for questionssupplies and finance.   He has expressed the view that thedefence of the Bay of Bengal and the land around itconstitutes a single strategical problem and therefore that the Government of India should be placed ineffective charge, with due regard to the constitutional position of the other Governments concerned.    I recordthis view for consideration by the War Cabinet, though Ihave indicated to the Governor-General that the problem is essentially one for the Chiefs of Staff and for the warCabinet, especially in regard to operational control, whereclearly the naval aspect is one of major importance.    i suggest that the problem should be remitted to the Chiefsof Staff for an early report.   The questions of supplies and finance present a somewhat different problem.    i assume that the ultimate control would in both cases haveto rest with His Majesty&apos;s Government, though it might$3rdvery probably be convenient toIndia their principal agents,disposed of separately.August, 1940.make the Governmen&apos;This, however, canL. 3.Aolbe
