TjLPnGUMEHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIN:IC MAJESTY*B GOVERNMENT.BO S T   SECRET. Q9Z1J$Q^?ZjL-.,&apos;/.?. (40)  341..29th August ,  1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.IIt is requested that special care may he taken to ensurethe secrecy of this document../AR CABINET.SHIPPING FOR MIDDLE EAST CONVOY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.1. The War Office are arranging further reinforcements to the Middle East and are aiming at dispatching a personnel and fast Mechanical Transport convoj&apos;&apos; sailing on September 25th.Plans have been based on the anticipation of a personnelcapacity for 22,000 troops and a M.T. capacity governed by thenumber of M.T. ships that can be found with the necessary speed.It is hoped to include in this convoy the personnel of the armoured Division, the dispatch of which has already been authorised by the Prime Minister, certain Army troops, and ifpossible some part of the Australian or New Zealand forces nowin the United Kingdom.20 It now transpires that, owing to the volume of personnel shipping already in or en route to the Middle East,ships will not be available to lift more than 10,000 men onSeptember 25th, unless additional suitable ships are withdrawnfrom trade.     As In any case it seems unlikely that shipping-will be available for the subsequent convoy till the first orsecond week in November, it is most important that the numbers to be shipped in September should be brought up to as near22,000 as possible.      I therefore    ask for authority to request the Ministry of Shipping to release from the Atlantic andother trade sufficient shipping to lift a total of 22,000 menon September 25th.3. In view of the necessity for using the limitedshipping to the fullest capacity , it may be found necessaryto accept some relaxation of the Board of Trade Regulations.The War Office,29th August,  1940.
