naval SITUATION.General Review.ENEMY air attack on shipping in Home Waters has been extended to the st. George&apos;s Channel and Irish Sea, and up to a distance of nearly 200 miles tothe westward of Northern Ireland.Minelaying by enemy aircraft has been less intensive.A convoy in the Dover Strait has been attacked by enemy shore batteriessituated near Cape Gris Nez.Our forces in British Somaliland have been successfully evacuated.Home Waters.2. M.T.Bs. carried out a patrol off the mouths of the Scheldt and Maasduring the nights of 15th/16th and 18th/19th August without result.In enemy air attacks during the week H.M. trawler Resparko and H.M. tugSt. Mellons were sunk at Falmouth, and H.M. net layer Kylemore was sunk off Harwich. R.F.A. Looe and H.M. trawler Recardo were damaged off South-west Ireland and in the Solent respectively.On the 20th August 2 enemy destroyers and a U-boat were attacked by oneof our reconnaissance aircraft about 70 miles W. of Horns Reef. This force was again attacked later by 4 aircraft, causing possible damage.Mediterranean.3. On the 15th August II.M. Ships Liverpool and Gloucester carried out as weep eastward of Crete without result. On the same day 3 low flying enemy aircraft dropped mines or torpedoes in Alexandria during an air raid. Themooring vessel Moor stone was sunk in shallow water.Early on the 17th Fort Capuzzo, Bardia and various military objectives inthe vicinity were bombarded by H.M. Ships Warspite, Malaya, Ramillies andKent. Subsequently the fleet was heavily but inaccurately bombed, and returnedto Alexandria without sustaining damage.During the week the enemy cut the last cable between Gibraltar and Malta.H.M. Submarine Osiris, while on patrol in the entrance to the Adriatic, sank an Italian merchant vessel of 3,000 tons.H.M.S. Liverpool, H.M.S. Orion and 6 destroyers left Alexandria on the20th to cover the passage of merchant vessels from Istanbul to Alexandria.Other Foreign Stations.4. H.M.S. Hobart was bombed during an. aij attack on Berbera on the15th August, but was not damaged. H.M.S. Kimberley was unsuccessfullybombed on the same day in position 34 miles west of Berbera.On the 17th H.M.S. Ceres engaged possible enemy posts near Biyofogo andBulhar (British Somaliland).The evacuation of British Somaliland was successfully completed on the18th August. 5,370 combatants, 1,044 civilians and 175 casualties have been landed in Aden from Berbera. All guns were embarked and lighters removed.Demolitions were also successfully carried out by H.M.S. Hobart. A small number of troops is missing. H.M.S. Hobart was again unsuccessfully attacked by enemy aircraft at Berbera. On the same day H.M.S. Caledon and h.M.S. Kandahar bombarded Bulhar. On the 19th, after bombarding Berbera,H.M.S. Hobart returned to Aden, while H.M.S. Caledon searched the coast asfar west as Gerih.5. The port of Sydney (Australia) was closed on the 17th August owingto the report of suspicious objects resembling mines off the entrance. The portwras reopened on the 18th and it is now considered doubtful if the objects sightedwere mines.At 0700 on 20th S.S. Turakina, 8,706 tons, bound from Wellington to Sydney,reported being gunned by a raider west of New Zealand. H.M.S. Achillesproceeded from Wellington to investigate,&quot; and H.M.A.S. Perth has also been
sent to the Tasman Sea. A search by 2 flying boats for the raider has so farproved unsuccessful, but a flying boat patrol along the trade route betweenSydney and Auckland is being continued.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. Five attacks by surface craft and three by aircraft have been carried outon U-Boats. On the 16th August an aircraft escorting a convoy made a promisingattack on a U-Boat 180 miles West of Bloody Foreland.On the 18th ELM. Armed Merchant Cruiser Circassia, depth-charged aU-Boat, which had previously attacked her, 150 miles North-East of the Azores.On the 20th H.M. Submarine Cachalot reported that she had sunk a U-Boat offLorient.The anti-submarine striking force in the North-western approaches hasrecently been strengthened by additional destroyers and trawlers.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.7. During the period 43,000 tons of shipping has been sunk by enemy action; of this total, 5 British ships (24,116 tons), 2 Swedish (4,134 tons) and1 Belgian (7,590 tons) were sunk by U-Boats in the North-Western approaches,2 British ships (6,898 tons) were mined and 2 small-fishing trawlers sunk by air attack.Enemy aircraft attacked shipping in the St. George&apos;s Channel on the17th, 18th, 19th and 20th August, and damaged 1 Norwegian and 3 British ships.On the 17th August an enemy flying boat unsuccessfully attacked a British ship30 miles North-West of Lewis.On the 20th August an outward-bound convoy was bombed off the North-West of Ireland, 1 British ship being slightly damaged, and on the same eveninga Northbound convoy was unsuccessfully attacked off Orfordness.8. On the 22nd August when the East-bound Channel convoy was approaching the Dover Strait it came under long-range fire from heavy gunssituated near Gris Nez. The bombardment continued for nearly 3 hours without success, 108 rounds being fired apparently in four gun salvoes. An enemy batteryof four guns and another of three guns were located. Two shells landed in Doverharbour, one narrowly missing a minesweeping trawler. Soon after midday thesame convoy was unsuccessfully attacked by 30 aircraft.Protection of Seaborne Trade.9. One thousand and eighty-two ships, including 150 Allied and 53 Neutral,were convoyed during the week ending noon the 21st August, of which one ship was torpedoed and sunk in the North-Western approaches. One cruiser, 9 armed merchant cruisers, 26 destroyers, 14 sloops and 19 corvettes were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the17th August were 1,062,016 tons, compared with 894,515 tons during the previousweek. Sixteen tankers brought 165,268 tons of oil. Mineral imports amountedto 278,866 tons, of which 192,376 tons were steel, scrap, pig iron and iron ore.Cereal imports were 249,170 tons, 26 ships being fully loaded with grain. Otherfoods imported totalled 107,735 tons, of which 21,406 tons were sugar,181,141 tons were refrigerated and tinned meat, and 8,328 tons were fresh, driedand tinned fruits. There were also in these convoys large quantities of timber,jute, cotton and wool.During the first seventeen days in August 53,400 tons of cargo destined forGreat Britain have been sunk, which is equivalent to 1 ton sunk for every 36 - 6 tonssafely landed from ships in convoy.Enemy Intelligence.German.10.   Air Reconnaisance on the 15th August showed the following at Kiel:Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Liitzoiv in dock and an 8-inch cruiser and the Kolnalongside.  At Wilhelmshaven an 8-inch cruiser was seen in dock, and at BremenSeijdlitz was completing showing smoke from her funnels.     Reports of two[21672] B
damaged cruisers at Stettin and Danzig probably refer to the Leipzig and theEmden. The aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, the pocket battleship admiral scheer, the 6-inch cruiser Nuremburg and possibly one other 6-inch cruiser havenot been recently located.E-boats have been observed at Helder, Calais, Boulogne and near Lorient.The main concentration of U-boats has been in the North-West approacheswhere up to six have been operating from close north westward of BloodyForeland to as far seaward as the meridian of 20c W. Three were located atLorieht by air reconnaissance on the 21st.Italian.11. During the period under review no change has been reported in theposition of Italian main units.Three Italian U-Boats have been operating off the Azores and between thoseislands and the African Coast.Five submarines were reported off Mersa Matruh on the 17th August butaircraft sent to attack were unable to find them.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.12.   On the 12th August the Havelland (6,334 tons) arrived at Yokohama.She had sailed from Manzanillo, Mexico on the 27th June, and was reported two&apos; days out to be flying the Swedish flag.It has been reported from Stockholm that a German supply ship has been mined in the southern part of the Sound, and that three German steamers were sunk south of Falsterbo about the end of July. On 17th August a motor ship of the Hugo Stinnes Line arrived at Gothenburg, her bows having been seriously damaged by a mine. She left again on 18th August after completing temporaryrepairs.At Vigo the JJsaramo (7,775 tons) is reported to have taken on 700 tons ofcoal and to be ready for sea. The tanker Nordmeer (5,646 tons), which left Vigoon 1st August, is reported to have reached Bayonne.The Helgoland (3,664 tons) at Puerto. Colombia, is said to be amplyprovisioned and to have taken on a crew.Italian.13. A tanker of 1,500 tons is reported to have left Fiume on 19th Augustwith a cargo of petrol.The Alabama, 6,725 tons, which was &quot;recently^ refloated offMaracaibo, where she had scuttled herself, will be escorted to Las Pedras by a Venezuelan gunboat.She is to be interned by the Venezuelan Government.British Minelaying.14. On 16th August H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 260 mines in the East coast barrier, and on the following day H.M. Ships Southern Prince, Menestheus, PortNapier and Quebec laid 1.520 mines in the Northern extension of the Barrier. Onthe 19th August H.M.S. Cachalot laid 50 mines in the approaches to Lorient, andon the day after H.M.S. Teviot Bank and H.M.S. Plover laid a further 350 in theEast Coast Barrier. During the night of the 19th-20th aircraft laid mines inthe Huibert Gat (in the mouth of the Ems River) and off Aalborg (Denmark).As far as can be estimated from information available, the number of shipssunk by British air-borne mines in German waters is twenty-two German ships and seventeen neutrals, with a total combined tonnage of 93,910 tons. In thecurrent week minelaying by aircraft has been somewhat reduced and has been divided equally between Bomber and Coastal Commands.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.15. Magnetic minelaying by enemy aircraft has been less intensive duringthe past week. No reports were received of minelaying during the night of the14th/ 15th August, the first blank night for ten days.   Minelaying was suspected
outside Scapa and in Hoy Sound on the night of the 19th August. The entrance to Hoy Sound was closed, and H.M. Ships were ordered to wait outsideScapa until the entrance was reported clear. Two mines which were dropped onshore, one at Piddlehinton, near Dorchester, and the other at Southwich, nearShoreham, have been recovered. During the week 23 mines have been accountedfor, bringing the magnetic mine total to 621.A dangerous area was declared about 10 miles north-east of St. Abb&apos;s Headon the 18th August following a report from a fishing boat that she had seen a motor boat laying mines, and later picked up a mine in her trawl. The area hasbeen partially swept without result.The contact mine total is now 501.The Tyne-Blyth inshore channel, closed since the 6th July, was reopenedwith a reduced width on the 17th August for small coasting vessels.The clearance of the Inchkeith British minefield was carried out betweenthe 8th and 24th July.The only ports closed on the 21st August were Stromness and the Kyles ofBute.M mediterranean.16. Twenty moored mines have recently been swept in the minefield to thenorth-east of Alexandria.   These are included in the total given above.An enemy aircraft dropped three objects near the entrance to Alexandriaon the 15th August. No results have been achieved by frequent sweeping withskid with both polarities. Two large wooden tail fins have been picked up, but no decision has yet been reached as to the nature of the objects.A mine sinker laid by an Italian submarine has been recovered offAlexandria. It has about 250 fathoms of mooring rope of f-inch circumference.Minelaying by submarines up to this depth must therefore be considered.Economic Warfare.17. during the first half of August the Contraband Control Committeedealt with the cases of 51 ships, of which four are decisions on cases shown in a previous return. Five ships, three of which were Greek, were detained, and the cargo of one Yugoslav ship was seized in prize. Fifteen ships with their cargoeswere released.-U.S.S.R.18. Reports have been received from a source believed to be reliable thatthe submarine strength of the Soviet Far Eastern Fleet has been increased byabout 18 small coastal submarines of the &quot;M&quot; Class (180 tons). This would bring the total of that class in the Far East up to 50 and the strength of thewhole Far Eastern submarine forces up to about 95.These small submarines have a maximum endurance of only 700 miles andare, therefore, designed mainly for defensive purposes.MILITARY SITUATION.Middle East.Malta.19. Air raids have been less frequent during the last week, but two causedcertain damage to aircraft on the ground, and to works and buildings round the aerodromes.  There were no casualties to personnel.Egypt.20. The Italian offensive against Egypt is still awaited. In the meantimethere has been little activity in the frontier area of Eastern Cirenaica, although a large Italian garrison is still in close proximity.   It is probable that action by
our aircraft has interfered with preparation of the large dumps that will berequired to supply advancing columns. It is also possible that if Italy intends to begin hostilities in Greece an attack on Egypt will be timed to coincide withGreek requests for a fulfilment of our guarantee.21. There have been recent reports of an equivocal attitude on the part ofthe Egyptian Army in the event of an Italian offensive. The Prime Minister,however, has given an assurance that Egyptian troops will come directly under british orders if the Italians pass east of a line Sidi-el-Barrani-Siwa.Sudan22. Italian patrol activity in the Gallabat area has considerably increased during the week. Aircraft and cavalry have been employed as well as infantry,and on the 18th August a force estimated at from 200 to 600 men raided and destroyed a village 6 miles south-west of Gallabat.British Somaliland.23. On the 15th August further heavy attacks were launched by the Italiansagainst our positions on Observation Hill and Castle Hill. The reserves availablewere not sufficient to restore the situation, and it was clear that evacuation was inevitable.The withdrawal was covered by 2 Black Watch arid embarkationcommenced on the night of the 16th August. Civilians and refugees were firstembarked and evacuation completed by the 18th August. Most of the valuablestores, including anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns and bren carriers were taken off. The M.T. and stores which had to be left behind were destroyed. TheItalian forces suffered heavy casualties.Palestine.24. The population generally is disinclined to assist the rebels, and therehas been no rebel activity other than banditry. Anti-British propaganda is strong in Galilee and Samaria, where it is being spread by gangsters recentlyreturned from Syria. Italian air raids on Haifa have had little moral effect.There is less inclination to believe enemy wireless propaganda, while our own issaid to be considerably more effective.The Balkan States.Yugoslavia.25. Strong Italian forces are still massed on the Italo-Yugoslav frontier,and the forces in Albania appear to be moving towards Greece. Recent reports and the distribution of Italian forces indicate that an attack on eitherYugoslavia or Greece is possible.Greece.26. The Greek attitude remains correct, and every effort has been made toavoid taking any action that would provoke Italy or be regarded as a pretext for attack; for this reason there is at present no intention to order mobilisation.India.27. The situation in northern Waziristan continues to deteriorate.Offences have been frequent, and in recent sniping at &apos;&quot;&apos; Razcol&apos;&apos; one british officer and one B.O.R. were killed.Far East.China.28. Our garrisons in Tientsin and Peking withdrew to Shanghai on the18th August, and the whole of our garrisons in North China were due to leaveShanghai on the 22nd August. A few details have been left at Tientsin andPeking to clear up.
Both British defence sectors at Shanghai have been relinquished without incident. The extra-settlement (western) sector is under Japanese control(Japanese Gendarmerie and Chinese city government police), though the japanese have so far fulfilled their verbal assurance not to station troops in the sector the question of control of the other British sector (&quot; B &quot; sector whichcomprises the business centre of Shanghai) is under discussion between theJapanese and IT. S. Governments. As a temporary measure it has been taken overby the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.AIR SITUATION.General Review.29. While maintaining the air offensive against Germany, the primaryaim of our bombing operations continues to be the reduction of the scale of air attack on this country, and successful attacks have been made on aircraft factories and aerodromes. The German Air Force has suffered very considerable casualties in costly attempts to gain air superiority over Britain, which have so far yieldedno material results.  Weather conditions have restricted operations on both sides.30. Bomber Command also operated against oil and industrial targets and communications with encouraging results, the most notable attacks being againstthe hydrogenation plant at Leuna and the aluminium works at Rheinfelden.Attacks against industrial targets in Northern Italy were also successfullymaintained. Fighter Command carried out very extensive and most effectiveoperations, while Coastal and North Sea operations were of a normal character.One submarine was probably destroyed and minelaying was continued.31. German air operations were chiefly against aerodromes, thoughindustrial targets and military establishments were also attacked. Operationsvaried considerably in intensity. The average number of aircraft of all typesoperating against this country per day was about seven hundred. Of theseapproximately two hundred were long-range bombers, a few coastal types, and thewhole of the remainder short-range dive-bombers and fighters. This allotmentof forces, together with the targets attacked, leads to the conclusion that theGerman Air Force is attempting to destroy our fighter defences, both by wearingthem down and by direct attack, to pave the way for large-scale bombing raidsby the long-range bomber force. German reconnaissance aircraft were regularlyemployed throughout the week on weather flights, looking for shipping,reconnoitring targets prior to raids and assessing damage after them. Mine-layers were particularly active in the early part of the week. Transport aircraft are still extensively supplementing communications in France and the low countries. The German air force is apparently making great efforts to improvenight-flying training on all types.Great. Britain.32. During daylight hours on the 15th, 16th and 18th the German AirForce attacked this country on a heavy scale, the enemy operating in wavesconsisting in some cases of as many as 150 aircraft. On the 15th August it isestimated that 4^004^ eliemy aircraft were engaged and on each of the other two l^%oodays about 700. On the remaining days of the week the scale of attack by comparison was relatively inconsiderable, although there was a slight increase on the 21st, when a large number of raids by one or two enemy aircraft wasmade over a wide area.33. On the three days on which the principal attacks were made a largenumber of enemy fighters escorted their bombers; the primary object of these attacks was to gain air superiority by destroying our fighter defences, both inthe air and on the ground. Throughout the week the main weight of attack was directed against our aerodromes, which were attacked throughout the country,some as many as three times. Aerodromes of every description were attacked,though the emphasis was on fighter stations. No significant success was achieved and, although 47 aerodromes were damaged, eleven considerably, theair situation was not materially affected : 41 operational aircraft were destroyed on the ground and -ar^fbopstge- hangars containing 47 twin-engined trainers vm&amp;burnt out. Naval and industrial targets were also attacked and in some cases[21672] c
considerable damage was inflicted, though the aircraft industry did not sufferseriously. By night the customary offensive reconnaissances have continuedexcept for the night of the 20th/21st, when enemy activity was negligible.34. Our fighters engaged the enemy on all possible occasions, with theresult that at least 400 of his aircraft were destroyed. Our own fighter losses are not serious, nor are they very heavy in view of the intensity of operations.Fighter Command flew 1,122 patrols, involving 4,932 sorties during the week.Details of casualties are given in Appendix V. In spite of the heavy lossesincurred, the enemy has failed in his primary object and has gained no strategicadvantage.Enemy Territory in Europe.35. Bomber Command flew 91 day and 549 night sorties during the week.The German Air Force was attacked chiefly through airframe component and assembly factories and storage units, combined with extensive day and night operations against aerodromes by medium and heavy bombers. Oil, industrial and canal targets were also bombed and the initial heavy attacks on Northern Italyhave been followed up on a lighter scale. All these operations met with considerable success.36. On six days of the week Blenheims were detailed to attack aerodromes and on some occasions oil and aircraft factory targets, but owing to unfavourable weather conditions only a few attacks were successfully carried out.37. With the exception of the night 20th/21st August, when weather conditions were entirely unfavourable, Bomber Command operated every nightagainst a variety of targets, the most notable attacks being the following :Germany&apos;s largest hydrogenation plant at Leuna was most successfully attacked on the night of the 16th/ 17th by 38 heavy bombers. In spite of very unfavourable weather on the following night, four Whitleys attacked industrial targets inNorthern Italy and inflicted considerable damage on aircraft factories and other objectives at Milan, Turin and Sesto San Giovanni. Ten aircraft also extensivelydamaged the aluminium works at Bheinfelden, near Basle, where all reporteddirect hits and the whole target was left in flames. On the night of the 19th/20tha strong force of Wellingtons were unable, on account of bad weather, to locate theGneisenau at Kiel, but heavily bombed the dock area. The electricity power station at Golpa, South of Dessau, was heavily attacked, and the oil plant atAmbes (Bordeaux) was bombed by thirteen aircraft and is considered to be completely destroyed.38. Successful attacks were also made on the aluminium works at Lunen,aircraft factories and stores at Frankfort, Bernburg, Kolleda and Augsburg,oil targets at Gelsenkirchen, Reisholz, Bohlen Rotha, Zeitz and Magdeburg and factories at Jena, Essen and Waldshut. Direct hits were secured on the ship-lift under construction on the Mitteland Canal and on lock gates on the Dortmund-Ems Canal. Extracts from recent Raid Assessment Reports are included inAppendix VI.  Three enemy fighters were destroyed by bombers during the week.North Sea and Coastal.39. During the week Coastal Command provided escorts for 139 convoys and flew 548 other sorties. Mines were laid off the Dutch, German and Danishcoasts by nine aircraft from Bomber Command and 23 from Coastal Command.Numerous photographic reconnaissances were successfully carried out. On each day in the week Bomber Command despatched six Blenheims to carry out a sweepin the North Sea.40. Three Fleet Air Arm aircraft successfully bombed the docks at Helderand Boulogne Harbour was attacked on three nights by Battle aircraft. A nightbombing attack was successfully carried out by Blenheims against the docks and shipping at Helder and Willemsoord.41. As reported in the Naval Section, three attacks were made on sub-marines, one apparently successful, and enemy warships and merchant-vesselsAvere attacked off Horns Reef on the 19th and 20th by Fleet Air Arm and coastal command aircraft. Of these, one Hudson was attacked by seven Messerschmitt109s, one of which was destroyed after an engagement lasting 35 minutes.
Middle East and Mediterranean.Gibraltar.42. During the week anti-submarine patrols were maintained. On the night of the 20th/21st, two raids were made by single enemy aircraft, one tug and awater main being slightly damaged. The first aircraft was shot down by our a.A. fire.Malta.43. On the 15th August five bombers, escorted by at least twenty fighters,attacked Hal Far aerodromes. One Swordfish was destroyed on the ground andone of four intercepting Hurricanes dived into the sea. On the 20th ten enemy bombers, escorted by about twenty fighters, dropped bombs on Flal Far and Luqaaerodromes, resulting in one Blenheim being destroyed on the ground and threeBlenheims and two Swordfish being damaged. The enemy was inconclusivelyengaged and the formation was dispersed.Egypt.44. On the 17th August fighter patrols were provided as an escort for theFleet engaged in the bombardment of Capuzzo and Bardia. Our fighters engagedthe enemy bombers that attacked our ships and eight enemy aircraft were shot down, a further two probably being casualties.45. During the week attacks were maintained on enemy aerodromes, ports,fuel storage and military objectives. On the 15th four flying boats were probably destroyed and eight severely damaged by a low-flying attack on Bomba,and on the 21st&quot;three S.79&apos;s were destroyed at Sidi-el-Tmimi. The Italians twiceattacked Alexandria and once Sidi Barrani.Sudan.46. On the 15th August five Wellesleys attacked Air Force and Navalbarracks at Massawa, registering direct hits on a large building and the railway.During the week escorts were provided for two convoys. On the 17th August,Wellesleys carried out a low level attack on Kassala Fort and, on the 20th August,a similar attack on Kassala Station.Italian East Africa, Aden and Somaliland.47. Fighter patrols were maintained over Berbera to cover the evacuation.On the 15th August the town of Dessie and the aerodrome at Jijiga were success-fully bombed, and harassing attacks against aerodromes, concentrations and enemy positions were continued until the 20th. On the 18th four Wellesleyssuccessfully raided Addis Ababa aerodrome; the first attack during the war. on several occasions enemy aircraft attempted to bomb naval units, but inflicted no damage.   On the 16th two enemy aircraft made three attacks on Berbera.Kenya.48. A number of successful and valuable reconnaissances were carried outby the South African Air Force, and, during the 19th and 20th, Battles made anumber of successful low-bombing attacks on aerodromes, fuel stocks and other military objectives.Air Intelligence.French North Africa.49 Orders are reported to have been received by the French Air Force in north Africa detailing the demobilisation measures, on which agreement has nowbeen reached between the French, German and Italian armistice commissions.According to these about 150 aircraft are to be stationed in Morocco, Algeria andTunisia respectively. The fact that eleven groupes of military aircraft have been allotted to Morocco alone, however, suggests that this number may, in practice, be somewhat exceeded. All aircraft in North Africa, other than those detailed toremain in the territories in question, are to concentrate at Tunis. From Tunisthey will be flown to Istres where aircraft will be dismantled and personneldemobilised. It is understood that precautions have been taken by the french authorities to obviate the danger of landing at Gibraltar. Transference of aircraft from Morocco and Algeria to Tunis will commence forthwith.
Finland.50. It is reported, but as yet unconfirmed, that 30 to 40 Messerschmitt 109have been supplied to Finland by Germany. It is stated that these aircraftarrived in Helsinki about the 14th, having been flown to Bromma in Sweden by german pilots, and thence to Finland by Finns.According to an authoritative source there will be a total number of 1,000pilots with more than 75 hours&apos; flying experience in the Finnish Air Force by theend of the year.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General Review.51.   The enemy&apos;s air activity has considerably increased during the lastweek, especially in the Liverpool and Midland areas.Raiding has taken the form of (1) Mass attacks by day on aerodromes, chiefly in the South-East and South.(2) Less extensive attacks by day on ports and aircraft factories.(3) Harassing attacks by day and night on industry, communications andmilitary establishments.Damage.Naval Bases.52. (a) Pembroke Dock. The naval oil tanks at Llanreath were fired,involving the loss of some thousands of tons. The fire has not yet beenextinguished.(b) Chatham Dockyard. Damage was caused to the saw mill and smithery.(c) Naval Training Establishment, Skegness. The establishment was seriously damaged and one-third of the huts destroyed.A aerodromes.53.   Damage is reported under Air Situation.Industry.54. (a) Aircraft factories have been hit and damage sustained by Popjoysand Shorts at Rochester, the Rollason and Redwing factories at Croydon, and toa slight extent by the Bristol Aircraft Factory.(5) Liverpool and Port Talbot Docks, the Singer works at Birmingham, andNewman&apos;s Industries at Yate have suffered damage. Bombs dropped on otherfactories have not seriously affected production.(c) Considerable damage has been done to gas, electricity, water and telephone services, and at Bridlington the General Post Office was destroyed.Railway Communications.55. Railway communications and sidings have been hit in a number of areas, and have caused traffic delays.Casualties.56. The following are the approximate civilian casualties during theweek : Serioibsly    slightly killed.       Injured.     Injured.By Day .........      298 488 521By Night      ......      ...        33 91 79Of these, 173 were killed, 179 seriously and 268 slightly injured in daylightraids on Croydon, South-West London and Northfleet on the 15th and16th August.Civil Defence Services.57. The skill and endurance of the Services has been highly tested duringthe week, and great enthusiasm has been shown. The Services have given muchassistance at R.A.F. aerodromes in addition to their local responsibilities.
