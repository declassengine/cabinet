this document is the property of his britannic majestys governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1940.SECRET.W.P. W 352.September 3, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special  care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE MUNITIONS SITUATION.Memorandihm by the Prime Minister.I VENTURE to submit to my colleagues the following points which suggestthemselves to me in reading the deeply interesting survey of the Minister ofSupply: *1. The Navy can lose us the war, but only the Air Eorce can win it.Therefore our supreme effort must be to gain overwhelming mastery in the Air.The Fighters are our salvation, but the Bombers alone provide the means of victory. We must therefore develop the power to carry an ever-increasingvolume of explosives to Germany, so as to pulverise the entire industry and scientific structure on which the war effort and economic life of the enemydepends, while holding him at arm&apos;s length in our Island. In no other way atpresent visible can we hope to overcome the immense military power of Germany,and to nullify the further German victories which may be apprehended as the weight of their force is brought to bear upon African or Oriental theatres. TheAir Force and its action on the largest scale must therefore, subject to what issaid later, claim the first place over the Navy or the Army.2. The weapon of blockade has become blunted and rendered, as far as germany is concerned, less effectual on account of their land conquests and power to rob captive or intimidated peoples for their own benefit.   There* W.P. (40) 339.[21709]Copy No.   2
remain no very important special commodities the denial of which willhamper their war effort. The Navy is at present somewhat pressed inits task of keeping open the communications, but as this condition is removed by new Admiralty measures, by the arrival of the Americandestroyers, and by the increasing output of anti-U-Boat craft from ourown yards, we may expect a marked improvement. It is of the utmost importance that the Admiralty should direct their attention to aggressive schemesof war, and to the bombardment of enemy or enemy-held coasts, particularly inthe Mediterranean. The production of anti-U-Boat craft must proceed at themaximum until further orders, each slip being filled as it is vacated. The naval programme does not impinge markedly upon the Air, and should cede some ofits armourplate to Tank production.3. The decision to raise the Army to a strength of 55 Divisions as rapid! vas possible does not seem to require any reconsideration. Within this, we should aim at 10 Armoured Divisions, 5 by the Spring, 7 by the Summer, and 10 by theend of 1941. The execution of these programmes of armament supply will taxour munitions factories to the full. I agree in principle with the proposals of theMinister of Supply for handling the ammunition supply problem, and also thatfirings on the 1917-18 scale are not to be expected in the present war.4. The most intense efforts must be made to complete the equipment of our army at home, and of our Army in the Middle East. The most serious weak-points are Tanks and small arms ammunition, particularly the special types;anti-Tank guns and rifles, and even more their ammunition; trench mortars, and still more their ammunition; and rifles. We hope to obtain an additional 250,000rifles from the United States, but it is lamentable that we should be told that no more than half a million additional rifles can be manufactured here before the endof 1941. Surely as large numbers of our Regular Army proceed abroad, the need of the Home Guard and of garrison troops for home defence on a far larger scale than at present will be felt. A substantial increase in rifle-making capacity is necessary.5. The danger of invasion will not disappear with the coming of winter,and may confront us with novel possibilities in the coming year. The enemy&apos;sneed to strike down this country will naturally increase as the war progresses,and all kinds of appliances for crossing the seas, that do not now exist, may be devised. Actual invasion must be regarded as perpetually threatened but unlikely to materialise as long as strong forces stand in this Island. Apart from this, theonly major theatre of war which can be foreseen in 1940-41 is the Middle East.Here we must endeavour to bring into action British, Australasian and indian forces, on a scale which should only be limited by sea transport and local mainten-ance. We must expect to fight in Egypt and the Sudan, in Turkey, Syria orPalestine, and possibly in Iraq and Iran. Fifteen British&apos; Divisions6 Australasian, and at least 6 Indian Divisions should be prepared for thesetheatres, these forces not being, however, additional to the 55 Divisions whichhave been mentioned.   One would not imagine that the ammunition expenditure
would approach the last War scale.   Air power and mechanised troops will bethe dominant factors.6. There remain the possibilities of amphibious aggressive warfare againstthe enemy or enemy-held territory in Europe or North Africa. But the needs ofsuch operations will be provided by the arms and supplies already mentioned ingeneral terms.7. Our task, as the Minister of Supply rightly reminds us, is indeedformidable when the gigantic scale of German military and aviation equipment is considered. This war is not, however, a war of masses of men hurling masses of shells at each other. It is by devising new weapons, and above all, by scientificleadership, that we shall best cope with the enemy&apos;s superior strength. If, forinstance, the series of inventions now being developed to find and hit enemy aircraft, both from the air and from the ground, irrespective of visibility, realisewhat is hoped from them, not only the strategic but the munitions situation would be profoundly altered. And if the U.P. weapon can be provided withammunition, predictors and other aids which realise an accuracy of hitting three or four times as great as that which now exists, the ground will have taken along step towards the re-conquest of the Air. The Navy will regain much of itsold freedom of movement and power to take offensive action. And the Army willbe able to land at many points without the risk of being Namsossed. We must therefore regard the whole sphere of R.D.F., with its many refinements and jmeasureless possibilities, as ranking in priority with the Air Force, of which it is &apos;in fact an essential part. The multiplication of the high-class scientificpersonnel, as well as the training of those who will handle the new weapons and research work connected with them, should be the very spearpoint of our thought and effort. Very great reliefs may be expected in anti-aircraft guns andammunition, although it is at present too soon to alter present plans.8. Apart from a large-scale invasion, which is unlikely, there is no prospectof any large expenditure or wastage of military munitions before the Spring of1941. Although heavy and decisive fighting may develop at any time in theMiddle East, the difficulties of transport, both of reinforcements and of supplies,will restrict numbers and expenditure. We have, therefore, before us, if notinterrupted, a period of eight months in which to make an enormous improvementin our output of war-like equipment, and in which steady and rapid accumula-tions may be hoped for. It is upon this purpose that all our resources of credit,materials, and above all, of skilled labour, must be bent.W. S. C.10 Downing Street,September 3, 1940.
