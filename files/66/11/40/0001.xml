THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT -Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 360.September 6. 1940.TO BE-KEPT &apos; UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE MUNITIONS SITUATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.I HAVE read the Prime Minister&apos;s memorandum on &quot;The MunitionsSituation.&quot;1. In it he acknowledges the crucial strategic value of the Airplane as an offensive weapon.2. In order to support and sustain the Prime Minister&apos;s conviction I desirea little more latitude, enabling me to carry the programme to a successful conclusion.3. The Ministry of Aircraft Production must, above all, be given a firsthelping of the raw materials required in the manufacture of aircraft. At present we are not getting our just claims, mainly out of our consideration for theMinistry of Supply.4. But the recognition by the Prime Minister of the character which theAir has assumed in this war as the primary instrument of victory gives theMinistry of Aircraft Production the right, indeed the duty, to claim an absolute priority for the materials it needs as the supplying agency of the Air Forces.This right must not be tampered with by any priority committees or otherdevices.5. This claim is strengthened by the strategical disadvantage which our aircraft industry suffers as compared with the Germans. The journey which enemy bombers must make to reach vital industrial targets in Britain is about one-fifth of the distance our bombers must cover to strike at comparable targets in the Reich. That is to say, with a given number of aircraft, the enemy canstrike with three or four times the power we can. He has the additional advantageof a large reserve of factories in Germany and the conquered territories where he can, without disturbing production of existing types, develop a production ofnew types.6. The existence of these handicaps makes it all the more important that theaircraft industry should be equipped with the authority, the power and theresources which it requires to reach and to sustain an output matching, as nearas may be, that of the enemy.7.   Supply of machines will not in itself secure for the Air Force thatmastery of the skies to which the Prime Minister looks for the hope and themethod of victory.   It is imperative that pilot strength should be increased.Here it is necessary to exploit new fields of recruitment and training.[21726]
8. I urge that the Navy should be called upon to develop a much strongertraining programme. The personnel of the Navy is well suited by temperamentand by trained skill in navigation to provide the most excellent material for anincreased flying service.  The Fleet Air Arm should be expanded.9. The Army, too, should be required to develop a training programme andan Army Air Arm. Owing to family tradition, which draws many young menof the finest type to its regiments, the Army has at present a call upon an areaof recruitment which is denied to the R.A.F. This is an inequality which shouldbe adjusted now that the air is recognised as the crucial theatre of war. Anappeal by the Prime Minister, coupled with the necessary instruction to themilitary authorities, would make available for the air a large number of volunteers courageous and disciplined. And both in the Army and the Navythere are many young men who already know how to fly and would need verylittle additional training.10. The supreme military lesson of the land campaigns of this war is thatthe army should be equipped with a force of aircraft ear-marked for military use and trained to play its part as a component of the land forces in a generalstrategic scheme.11. The German Luftwafje is primarily regarded as a section of the army,a kind of long-range artillery. Germany&apos;s military successes have been achieved by a close co-ordination of the services, above all of dive bombers and tanks. TheGerman air attack in Poland, Flanders and France was fused into the generaloffensive.12. This is, of course, a type of warfare quite different from the purely air attack now conducted against German industry and communications by theR.A.F. And, as it involves a subordination of the air arm to military plans, itcalls for the creation of a military air arm and for the recruitment of pilots whohave a special understanding of the problems and the needs of the land forces.13. If we are to pass from.the present, war of attrition waged againstGermany&apos;s economic life to a military offensive, we must develop immense airarms. Against such a development the opposition of the Air Ministry shouldnot be allowed to prevail.14. Given freedom from hampering interference, asked no longer to defendhis programme at every turn, given control of all components of manufacturenot at present under his authority and with the right to exact from&apos;the AirMinistry Training Command a proper use of Training equipment, the Ministerof Aircraft Production will undertake to supply enough training machines forthe R.A.F., the Navy and the Army, without impairing the supply of operationalmachines.15. This undertaking is given, subject only to the condition that bombing operations by the enemy do not reach a scale and intensity transcending anythingso far known.Ministry of Aircraft Production, S.W. 1,September 6, 1940.
