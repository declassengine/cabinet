THIS DOCUMENT IS: THE. PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1940.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 347.August 30, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy o! this document.WAR CABINET.PRIORITY FOR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW AERODROMES.Note by Secretary of State for Air.AS stated by the Prime Minister in W.P. (40) 338, 75 additional aerodromesare under construction, and will, it is hoped, be completed by the end of 1940.Another 50 aerodromes are to be at once selected and surveyed.2. The need for additional aerodromes is most pressing. The changedstrategic situation has necessitated the development of the air defence s3rstem inthe west and south-west, and many aerodromes originally earmarked for training purposes have now, of necessity, been appropriated for operational squadrons.More aerodromes are needed for training, and recent events have indicated theneed for further dispersion of all flying units. It is also desirable that units atpresent located on &quot; factory &quot; aerodromes should be removed in order to reducethe probability of enemy air attack. To meet these needs, 50 additionalaerodromes are a bare minimum, and it is essential that we should get to work without delay.3. We have already been held up by the special priority (higher than works and Buildings Priority &quot; A &quot;) given to defence works last May.* This has hadthe effect of giving second priority only to constructional work on aerodromes.It is clear, however, that nothing less than the highest priority is justified forthis work. If this priority is not given at once the winter will be upon us and building work will be liable to serious delay and interruption, due to short working days and bad weather. The grant of this priority should not interfere with urgentdefence works since, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, many of these works are nearing completion and much labour, plant and material can shortly be released.4. I must therefore ask the War Cabinet to approve a special priorityhigher than &quot;W.BA.&quot; for this aerodrome work (including landing tracks and essential buildings) in respect of labour, plant and material, particularly bricksand cement.5. If this priority is obtained the first step will be to accelerate completionof aerodromes now under construction and the new aerodromes will be started and fed in behind the others as sites are found and made ready for constructionalwork to start.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, August 30, 1940.* W.M. (40) 139th Conclusions, (Item 2).[21697]
