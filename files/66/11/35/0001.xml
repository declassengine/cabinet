4TH SEPTEMBER, 1940,WAR CABINET,CREATION OF NEW AIRCRAFT CAPACITY IN U.S.A.M-Q^oyo-^Pr^-^^-y the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The paper W,Pc(40) 354 hy the Minister for aircraft production asks the Ware Cabinet to choose between two alternative schemes for the production of aircraft in theUoSoAcThe cost even of the lesser scheme is vast-      Icall attention to three points:-lo After the first year of operation the smaller scheme would cost some  300 millions per annum in dollars and thelarger some  800 millions per annum.     There is no prospectof our having dollars to pay these sums, nor of our everrepaying those amounts, if lent to us by the U.S.A.Production under either scheme depends on the willingness of the American Administration to pay for ite2e My immediate anxiety concerns payment out of ourown resources in the initial period.      There is no difference between the cost of the two schemes up to nextMaye     Unless special steps are taken, the initial costto us in dollars of either scheme is likely to be the equivalent of  75 millions up to December,  37-g- millions in January and  25 millions in each immediately succeedingmontho     This additional  75 millions up to Decembermakes it doubtful whether, on our own resources, we canlast out the current calendar yearB     A new Presidenttakes office on the 20th January, and if PresidentRodseveIt is not returned, there may be a period after that, while the new Government Is being formed and its policy formulated, before we can secure assistance.     Inthat event the necessity to find a further  57^ millions for this project in January and  25 millions in february and each month thereafter may lead to insuperabledifficulties030 A great deal of the initial expenditure is on capital construction,,     I understand there is now somehope that the American Administration may be prepared to share part, or even bear the whole, of the capital cost,and that this possibility is now being actively explored.It may be essential to this object that the aircraft production should be based on common types under a jointplan with United States defence0      If the United States(?2L2----liL^H?.?R?BETY 0F HIS BRIMlc majesty&apos; s govekmmmt)..-.TO BE KE^TJJNOE^p^        ^It is requested that special en &quot;ft n__m   -naueathe secrecy oi UW t,MOST slCRET&apos;I^Jifil,3550 - V COPY NO.

would defray the whole capital cost iii the first place the relief in the early months ought,, according to ourestimates, to bring the finance of the scheme within our capacity uxi^ll tl:.- tisxe when,&apos; whatever happens in theAmerican elections, assistance is expected to be available to us0     I feel sure that the War Cabinet willconcur in my wish that the greatest possible effort should be made by all concerned tp secure the agreementof the American Government to provide the capital cost.(Intdo)   K.W.Treasury Chambers, S.W.le4TH SEPTEMBER,  1940c
