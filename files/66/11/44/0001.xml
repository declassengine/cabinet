At their meeting51 on the ii-th September the war Satinet -&quot;invited the Chiefs of Staff to report towhat extent an extension of the ParEastern hostilities to Indo-China wouldbe likely to cause military or economicembarrassment   to Japan, on theassumption that effective resistancewas offered &quot;by the Government and population of Indo-China, aided perhapsby the Chinese&quot;.2. Our conclusions       given &quot;below.     A detailed examinationof the problem is attached as an Annex,,3* Effective resistance in Indo-China can only &quot;be counted on from units of the French forces.4. Chinese assist mice to the French in Indo-China is unlikely to &quot;be effective.5. It is estimated that a maximum of 11. Japanese divisions are available without decreasing the present scale of theireffort in China.     Should operations take place in Indo-china the probable    allotment of these functions would be -(a) Tonking - 3, reduced to 2 after a month,allowing; for likely scale of French resistance.(b) Yunnan - h., including the 1  released from (a).5 divisions world thus be left available forfurther   operations elsewhere.k   W.M.

If hostilities in the Far East are extended toIndo-China and Yunnan, Japan would, still have sufficientnaval and air forces available for large scale blockade.orharassing tactics on British territories in the Far East* .10o       Though the despatch and. maintenance of an additional-expedition must cause some, further strain on Japan, theextension of hostilities to Indo-China would be unlikely to cause her any appreciable economic embarrassment.      Inthe long run, the occupation of Indo-China should prove a definite economic advantage(Signed)    C.L.N. NSWALlA&quot; DUDLEY POUND.J.C.  DILL.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.9TH  SEPTEMBER,  19^0.

ANNEX.THE PROBABLE EEFECT ON JAPAN OF ANEXTENSION OF THE FAREASTERNHOSTILITIES TO INbo&quot;-CH INA.1. The assumption that effective resistance would he offered &quot;by the Government and people of Indo-China cannot he accepted in toto.     The population of Indo-China is largely disaffected towards the French and is - with theexception of a few hill tribes - unarmed and withoutfighting spirito      It is therefore not to be expected thatthe Japanese would be faced, in Indo-China,  with anything like the same difficulties from guerilla action that theyhave experienced in Chinae      It is  even possible that theymight be able to exploit discontent in some of theProvinces (the pretender to the throne of ANNAM holds acommission in the Japanese Army) to the embarassment ofthe Frencho2* The scale of Chinese help to Indo-China should notbe estimated too higha      In view of the lack of suitableindigenous material for guerilla warfare, Chinese actioninside French territory may be limited to guerilla action by small parties of their own troopso     The Japaneseevidently had this in mind when they asked to be allowed to station 5,000 men to protect three aerodromeso3. The problem to be considered therefore limits itselfto the question of what Japanese military commitments wouldbe in the event of their(a) invading Indo-China in the face of resistancefrom the French Government.(b) continuing their advance into China - this beingthe primary purpose of the move againstIndo-China.French forceso4. Naval Forces..2 - Mine layers2 - Sloops1-6&quot; CruiserNearly all these ships are believed to be at HAIPHONG.Army.5.       On current information the French ground forcesimmediately available for the defence of Tongking amount toone Divisions6.    - There are two weak Divisions in Cochin-China andCambodia but the availability of these troops for Tonglcingis doubtful for the following reasons -(a) Necessity for maintaining garrisons at Saigon,and on the Siamese border.(b) Requirements in internal security troops.      Theinternal situation has already heen discussed inparagraph 1 above and it is probable that theFrench would find it necessary to reinforce theone mixed colonial infantry regiment now stationed in Annam0(c) Lack of comiauni cat ions and vulnerability to japanese attack of &quot;:;he available rouxes.

7. Almost the only means of communication betweenCambodia and Tongking is by the coastal railway and itsparallel road which are, for almo-o-t -sell their length ?extremely vulnerable to action from seaward..8. Unless any extensive troop movements have already-taken place it is therefore unlikely that reinforcementscan reach Tongking after tho beginning of hostilities.9. Out of the Tordcingese Division (six infantryregiments one colonial artillery regiment and one companylight tanks  (1918 model),) loss than 50$ arc white troops.The remainder are Tonkingese of fighting value possiblyequal to Japanese. &apos;10. A.As  dofences are almost entirely lacking.Air Forces *11. Latest figures are;.-Fighters  (moderny 11A.B.R. 10General purpose 55Flying boats la12. On these figures it does not seem that the french forces in Tongking could offer&apos; effective resistance to more than two Japanese Divisions especially in viow ofthe overwhelming air support with which the latter could,and no doubt would;, bo provided.13. G.O.G.- 3 French Forces , however,,  considers  that hecould hold out against three Divisions fox&apos; a limited timeand it is proposed to accept this as a basis of argument.Japanese Forces,14. Navy. Adequate naval forces could be made avallabiefor operations in Indo-China without prejudice to any possible operations against Malaya.Army.15. It has previously been estimated that about Divisions could be made available without decreasingthe scale of effort in China.    It is possible- butnot yet confirmed that another 5 Divisions have been raised.16. Taking 11 as the. maximum disposable figure9  theirallotment might bo as follows(ay 5 Divisions for the  initial occupation ofTongking in the face of French resistance.The duration of effective resistance canonly be guessed, but would hardly exceedone month.    After one month, therefore,the Japanese commitment in Tongking wouldbe reduced to a maximum of 2 Divisions and1 Division would bo released for thecornmi tment imm.cdio.tcly f bllowing z -(by Operations against Yunnanfu.    Estimatedrequirement 4 Divisions over and above thenormal China requirement.    As these operations would,not, lpc unclorxaken until, the do sit ionin indo-China had boon consolidated,  thethi rd D^ -p  ton ox rLj oncsd above wjuldbe a voidable.

17. There remain 5 Divisions available for use in anytheatre, provided the necessary shipping were available;it is believed that this would be the case.18. Should however, it be desired to attack Britishinterests in Malaya, it is probable that the japanese would wish to secure and hold Camranh Bay, Tourane andSaigon, thus involving themselves with the remainder ofthe French Armyo     At least two extra Divisions would berequired for this purpose, leaving three available,19* Should the state of reinforcement of Malaya atthat time make this figure inadequate, then the raisingand especially the equipping of extra formations would impose a considerable strain on Japanese resources.Air Forcese20. Operations against Indo--China would not be likelyto affect appreciably the Japanese air forces reguiredfor operations else?/here, unless French resistance wasunexpectedly prolonged.Economic factors^21* The tranquil occupation of Indo-china by Japan,carried out overnight, with no interruption to cormunicationsor to actainistration, would enable Japan to obtain sufficientgood quality rubber to replace her imports from Malaya andthe Dutch East Indies of normal years*     She would alsoobtain perhaps 1-jr million tons of high-quality anthraciteand would be assured of control of a source of supply office upon which she draws in years of local shortage^    she would obtain, in the short run, no more iron ore than she isat present obtaining but the mines could be developed,.    she would also obtain control of small sources of supply ofantimony, manganese, lead, copper, zinc and tin.     Theimmediate output of these, however, v/ould be insignificant.22. Under present circumstances, it is probable that japan will be able to obtain most of the above by diplomaticpressure.      If, as is believed, she is really short ofsupplies at the present time, she is likely to lose, in the short run, by having to resort to military action againstIndo-China unless she believes that It can be carried out sorapidly as to cause verjr small interruption in production,cornrounications and equipment.23. In the long run, however, given time and opportunityto develop the country, and given tranquil possession byJapanese administration, the benefits to be gained by japan in Indo-China are of considerable importance, tending tomake her independent of non-Japanese sources of rubber andanthracite and of rice in bad years, and reducing herdependence for specialised minerals.
