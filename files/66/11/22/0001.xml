Jig DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVETOiDBHT. O copy No...,!,EGRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY..It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.Merchant Shipping Casualties.Memorandum  &quot;by the Naval Staff.Introduction.The enemy is concentrating a heavy attack on trade with submarines and aircraft, and in addition there has been a small but steady loss dueto raiders.  The latter may increase as, owing to the large number of troop movements requiring escort, we are unable to release cruisers and armed merchant cruisers to hunt raiders.    In the eight weeks up to the 25thAugust we have lost (British,Allied and Neutral) 143 ships of 564,000 tons;in addition a large number of ships have been damaged. The losses sustainedduring the last six days (Noon 23rd to Noon 29th August) are extremely serious - 15 ships totalling 92,000 tons sunk and 12 ships totalling42,000 tons damaged. It may well be that he now intends to make this attack on our shipping by submarine and aircraft his main offensiveinstead of invasion.2-    Factors affecting the situation.(a) Shipping from and to the United Kingdom is concentrated in a comparatively restricted a one, theNorth Western Approaches.(b) The danger from dive-bombing attack makes the diversion of shipping via South of Ireland impossible.(c) Enemy &apos;U8 boats s.re now being based in French Bay of Biscay Ports.(d) Enemy air reconnaissance is operating in conjunction with&apos;U* boats in North Western Approaches.(e) Shortage of escorts. In the last war we had the help of u.S. A.,French,Italian and Japanese Naval forces. WhenConvoy was introduced in 1917 we had 339 British destroyers and2,798 auxiliary small craft.These numbers had increased by the end of war   to 433: destroyers(excluding the U.S.destroyers).Today vr&amp; have 181 destroyers.In the last war the normal escort of convoys, which contained, fewer ships than at present, was 8-10 vessels,mostly destroyers, compared with 2 or 3 today. In addition,the average number of aircraft (seaplanes, aeroplanes and airships)employeed solely on anti-submarine patrols during the last 6 months of1918 was 564.(f) The threat of invasion which contains a considerableconcentration of light forces: on the   East and South East coasts.

(g) Our trade entering and leaving the West Coast portsis now exposed to bombing and the latest development is attack by aircraft torpedoes.3.     Measures1 to counter the offensive.(i)   Base convoy escorting forces on Londonderry.The Use of Lough Swilly would give us a. base: easyof access some 30 miles farther to the Westward but itis not considered that drastic steps with Ireland arenecessary at the present time to obtain the use of it.(ii) Establish a separate Naval Commander-in-Chief in charge of convoy operations in North Western Approaches at Londonderrywhere he will be in personal contact with escorts, (Thiscorresponds to Commander-in-Chief,Queenstown in the lastvar).(iii) Establish a Combined Area headquarters at Londonderry.(iv) Transfer the routeing organisation to the Admiralty to enablethe maximum use to be made of the intelligence available.(v) Increase the number of escorting vessels at the expense of some further reduction in anti-invasion forces.(vi) Concentrate all available anti-submarine vessels with the convoys,at the expense of hunting forces.(vii) Increase the air anti-submarine protection of the raonvoys.(viii) Increase the long range fighter escort availablefor protection of the convoys.(ix) Lay anti-submarine deep minefields in North WesternApj^roaches.(x) Aircraft employed on anti-submarine duties to be fitted to use depth charges whenever possible.(xi) Sail ships of 15 knots and over in groups of 5 or 6 ships with a small escort instead of independently as at present.(xii)still further reduce valuable shipping, such as refrigeratingships proceeding to East Coast ports.4.   Action outside Admiralty control required to implement the above proposals.(a) Provision of more flying boats from America,(b) Provision of long range anti-submarine shore-based reconnaissance aircraft   using existing types such as Wellingtons or Whitleys.(c) Provision of additional long range fighter squadrons in NorthernIreland and Northern Scotland areas to counter bombing and torpedoattacks from aircraft.NOTE   Proposals for (a),(b) and (c) above are shown in Appendix.

(d) Provision of additional aerodromes inNorthern Ireland as far West as possible:.(e) provision of guns, lights, &quot;balloon barrage etc.for anti-aircraft protection of Londonderry.(f) Provision of refrigerating trains for fillingcola storage in London from West coast.(g) To help offset our heavy losses of shippingit is recommended that orders should &quot;beplaced immediately in U.S.A. for &quot;buildingmerchant ships, but this is the subject ofa separate paper at present being jointlyprepared with the Minister without portfolioand the Minister of Shipping. .   -5 .   Ireland.If the enemy intends to make the attack on shipping his ,main effort against us in the immediatefuture, it is possible that he may attempt to establishhimself in Ireland in order to obtain bases and aerodromesfrom which to harass us.   Any success in this directionwoula most seriously affect the protection of our shipping.AUffiiALTY, S.W.1,August 29, 1940...
