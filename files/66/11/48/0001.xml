PRIME MINISTER.1* As you are aware 9 there has been a considerableamount of enemy bombing of railways and termini in. theLondon area.   We have been watching the general effect ofthis bombing in order to learn lessons.from it.2. I attach a copy of a memorandum prepared by theRailway Executive Committee at the request of Major 0*G.Villiers of the Key Points Intelligence Branch^ Ministry ofHome Security, together with a covering memorandum.5. The following points are apparent(i) congestion of rolling stock now building Up inmarshalling yards; and(ii) most of the trouble is caused by delayed action orunexploded bombs, which paralyse movement until they are blown up or removed.4. A solution to the problem of emptying marshalling yards lies in clearing the lines for traffic, and this in turn depends upon the rapid handling of delayed action andunexploded bombs.5. The sooner the bombs are exploded, the sooner thelines will be reopened for traffic.6. I have mentioned this matter to the Minister ofTransport, and apparently there is a serious shortage of skilled gangs capable of dealing with these bombs.(intld)     C.N.12th September, 1940.

To:- C.W.R.F.O.I.R.a;f.  IntelligenceH.Q. Home Forces.Wing Gdr. Peter Warburton.The Duty Captain, Admiralty.Captain R.P. Pirn, R.N.V.R.FROM:    KEY POINTS INTELLIGENCEBRANCH,Ministry of home security,Home Office, Whitehall,S.W.I.11th September, 194-0.During the past 1+8 hours I have been in close touch withthe Railway Executive Committee,  and through the kindness oftheir Secretary have been able to obtain a close survey of theeffect and places at which the enemy have so successfully attacked in the London Suburban Areas.     The attached resumehas been compiled by the Railway Executive, which disclosesthat the situation is serious.There is only one further aspect which is not recorded in the resume and it is that the tremendous congestion of allthe big marshalling railway yards around London may present a first class target to the enemy, which he may take advantage oftonight.So far the enemy has shown no intention of disorganisingany of the important strategic junctions further afield, suchas Reading, and therefore it is not possible to really gauge theultimate intention, but it can be said that the method by whichhe attacked these suburban railway lines showed profoundknowledge of the inner working system, because not only wasthe bombing so extraordinarily accurate - this is manifestby the manner in which he got direct hits on station afterstation as well as junctions and railway lines - but as theplan unfolds itself it is quite clearly evident that nothing was left to chance in order to secure the almost complete severence of communication between suburban areasNorth and South of the Thames and the main railway lines-Should further bombing take place on railways tonighta further appreciation will be issued tomorrow.Owing to the extreme secrecy of this informationdisclosed I have been requested to ensure that the circulation of the attached document shall be as small as possible,and to safeguard the document from being re-circulated asfar as lies within my power.(Signed)    O.G.

Short Summary on the general effect of enemybombing to the Railway Lines in the SuburbanAreas North and South of the Thames from Sundaymorning to Wednesday morningsQUESTIONS RAISED BY MAJOR VILLIERS.Question:    What has been the effect of damage to Railway Linesill the suburban areas north and south of the Thames fromSunday morning to Wednesday morning. ^Answer; South of the Thames so many lines have been stoppedfor greater or lesser periods that it was necessary to operate skeleton services partly by rail and partly by road,to enable workers to get to their places of employment in theMetropolitan area.Question: Had it been necessary to remove large numbers of people from the Thames side and the South East of england to London, would the damage have caused consid.erable difficulty?Answer:    Trains could have been worked from the coast to the outer periphery of London on the South and south-east but inthe majority of cases passengers would have had to transfer to road transport in order to reach the more central areas ofLondon and having regard to the damage to surface road routes,road transport would have impeded the movement of traffic andtherefore the normal flow of road transport would not have beenpossible.Question:    What effect has the damage caused to the transferof central Government traffic and other essential trafficsbetween the Northern Railways and South London,  and the south-eastern and central sections of the Southern Railway?Answer: The damage both north and south of the Thames to the link lines between the Northern and Southern Railways has hada most serious effect on the transfer of traffic;    forinstance,  the Great Northern Section of the L.N.E. Railwayforward between 50 and 60 trains to the Southern Company each day.      Since Saturday it has only been possible to work 4 trainsto the Southern. Company through London,  and. these were transferred this morningoAt present there are between 5/6,000 wagons held upon the L.NeE.  system awaiting transfer to the Southern.    Thisnecessitated a stop on the loading of all traffic destined forthe Section of the Southern Railway in question forwarded overthe L.N. E. Railway.The usual exchange routes between the L.M.S.  and theSouthern Central and South Western Sections have been seriously interfered with and a very considerable quantityof traffic is held, up in the Railway Yards on the Northernlines.      The L.M.S.  are able, however, to exchange a certainvolume of traffic with the Southern Company at points south-west of London and this has given some measure of relief.Question:    What is the effect of the long air raid &quot;red&quot;warning on the movements of merchandise traffic generally?

Answer:    &quot;Red&quot; warnings cause, for practical purposes,  a cessation of work in the goods and shunting yards and depots,which results in a general holdup.of the movement of trafficfor the period of the warning.     The frequency of thesewarnings has caused congestion on all Railway systemsthroughout the country as both loading and unloading .byRailways and Traders alike is seriously delayed, in additionto the work in the Marshalling Yards where the wagons aresorted for their destinations with the consequence that thetrains do not commence to run in the ordinary manner.     Itmust not be overlooked that trains running during air raidshave their speed restricted  - in the case of passengers to15 m.p.h.  and in the case of merchandise to 10 m.p.h., for reasons of safety.General.A most interesting factor which has been disclosed,especially during the last three days, is the speed with whichthe Railway lines are repaired as soon as they are freed frombombs.     The actual filling up of the tracks and relaying themetals takes but few hours.    Most of the trouble has been caused by delayed action or unexploded bombs, which paralysesmovement until they are touched off or dug out.11th September, 19u1
