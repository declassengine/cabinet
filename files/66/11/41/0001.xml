2NAYAL SITUATION.General Review.AN agreement has been concluded to transfer 50 destroyers from the UnitedStates to Great Britain.British naval forces have been active in both the Eastern and western mediterranean.U-Boat activity in the North Western Approaches has been maintained andE-Boats have achieved some success in attacks on shipping off the South-east coast.Home Waters.2. Destroyers carried out a sweep off the Dutch coast on the nights of the30th August and the 1st September without making contact with enemy forces.At 9-30 p.m. on the 31st August a report was received from one of our patrolaircraft that a large number of enemy vessels was 15 miles north of Terschellingsteering west at 15 knots. Orders were given to raise steam in all ships on theEast and South-East coasts and light craft from Rosyth and Nore Commandswere ordered to special patrol positions. Five minelaying destroyers proceeding to lay mines off Vlieland were ordered to jettison their mines and to locate and attack the enemy. While carrying out these instructions three out of the five ofthese destroyers were mined 40 miles north-west of the Texel, H.M. DestroyerEsk being sunk and H.M. Destroyer IvanJioe so seriously damaged that latershe was abandoned and sunk by our own forces. HM. Destroyer Express with her bows blown off was taken in tow and eventually reached Harwich. Ninetycasualties were landed by H.M. Destroyer Vortigern. A reconnaissance carriedout at daylight on the 1st September reported six merchant vessels, one minelayerand three minesweepers south of the Helder steering south.3. During the afternoon of the 31st August Eastbourne was shelled by whatappeared to be shells of 4-inch calibre.The battleship Prince of Wales, building at Birkenhead, was damaged by anear miss from a heavy bomb during an air raid on the 31st August.4. On the 1st September H.M.S. Fiji, while on escort duty, was torpedoed160 miles west of the Hebrides, but was able to reach port under her own steam.Her forward boiler room and adjacent compartments were flooded, and the boilerroom bulkhead was leaking heavily into the fore engine room. On the same dayH.M.S. Galatea, while entering Immingham, was slightly damaged by a mineexploding near her. While entering Rosyth on the same evening H.M. SubmarineSunfish collided with the patrol boat Mesnve, which sank immediately, 3 of the crew being killed.  Sunfish was not damaged.5. Six liners carrying 11,200 Canadian troops, escorted by H.M.S. Revenge,arrived in the Clyde on the 2nd September.On the 3rd September the Norwegian ship Tropic Star (5,781 tons) which hadbeen captured about 10 days after leaving Sydney (Australia) on the 10th june and had a German prize crew on board, scuttled herself 150 miles north-west ofFinisterre, when intercepted by H.M. Submarine Truant, who rescued the masterand his wife and 23 of the crew of the British s,s. Haxby (5,207 tons), whowere also on board. A Sunderland flying boat later picked up the remainder ofthe Norwegian crew.Mediterranean.6. A successful operation was carried out between the 30th August and the3rd September by our forces in the East and West Mediterranean, resulting inthe landing of anti-aircraft guns and other stores at Malta by H.M. Ships Valiant,Coventry and Calcutta, and the subsequent reinforcement of the mediterranean fleet by these ships and H.M.S. Illustrious. Elmas aerodrome in Sardinia was attacked by 9 Swordfish from H.M.S. Ark Royal on the 1st September, andalthough observation was difficult a Rome broadcast admitted damage and thedestruction of two aircraft on the ground. On the following morning Swordfishfrom H.M.S. Ark Royal attacked Cagliari. While returning to Alexandriaaircraft from H.M. Ships Illustrious and Eagle successfully attacked aerodromes
and military objectives on Rhodes Island. Four Swordfish failed to return.H-M.A.S. Sydney and H.M.S. Orion bombarded Scarpanto (an island south ofRhodes) with good results. The Sydney was unsuccessfully attacked by 3 E-boats,2 of which were sunk by ELM. Destroyer Ilex and the third damaged. during these operations our ships were constantly shadowed and at intervals unsuccess-fully attacked by enemy aircraft, 5 of which are reported to have been destroyed and 4 damaged on the 2nd September.Other Foreign Stations.7. With regard to the transfer of 50 American destroyers to the british navy, the first group of 8 destroyers should arrive at Halifax (Nova Scotia) onthe 6th September. 1,680 British officers and ratings have been sent to Halifaxas an advanced party for taking these ships over. It is intended that six of the transferred destroyers are to be manned by the Royal Canadian Navy.8. On the 29th August H.M.S. Bridgewater at Duala reported that thelocal response to allegiance to General de Gaulle was most cordial, a largecommunity demonstrating pro-British feelings on the ship&apos;s arrival.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. Early in the week H.M. Destroyer Mackay, in co-operation with aircraft,,attacked and damaged a U-Boat 80 miles north of Bloody Foreland. On the1st September H.M. Submarine Tuna, recently commissioned and on her firstpatrol, sank a U-Boat 150 miles east of St. Abb&apos;s Head, and later in the week,after delivering&apos;an attack on a U-Boat eastward of Dundee without result, washerself unsuccessfully attacked by another U-Boat. On the 2nd SeptemberH.M. Submarine Tigris, outward bound for a patrol area off the west coast ofFrance, sank a U-Boat off Ushant.Nine other attacks, of which four were by aircraft, were carried out in home Waters during the week, but without visible result.10. In the Mediterranean, three attacks were carried out by surface craftwithout visible result.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. During the period 66,000 tons of shipping have been sunk by enemy action; of this total, 6 British ships (28,258 tons), 3 Norwegian (7,288 tons),2 Greek (7,276 tons) and 1 Belgian (7,461 tons) were sunk by U-Boats, 1 smallDutch ship was mined, 3 ships (7,004 tons) were sunk by air attack and 4 British(7,593 tons) and 1 Dutch ship (1,075 tons) sunk by E-Boats. U-Boats have againconcentrated their attack on shipping in the North-Western Approaches. Duringthe evening of the 30th August two torpedo-carrying aircraft attacked a north-bound convoy off the Moray Firth and sank one Norwegian ship (1,832 tons), and during the night of the 2nd September a convoy was bombed off Kinnaird Headcausing damage to three ships. At 11 p.m. on the 4th September E-Boatsattacked a southbound convoy, escorted by two destroyers and a sloop, off GreatYarmouth and sank five ships.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. 974 ships, including 115 Allied and 40 neutral, were convoyed duringthe week ending noon the 4th September, of which 8 ships were lost by enemy action. One cruiser, 9 armed merchant cruisers, 42 destroyers, 17 sloops and21 corvettes were employed on escort duties. Since the commencement ofhostilities over 35,000 ships have been convoyed, of which 99 have been lost.13. Due to the increased importance of the North-Western Approaches ithas been decided to institute a separate command with headquarters at liverpool to deal with convoy operations in this area. A fuelling base forescorts is being established at Londonderry, and sea and air protection for shipping is to be increased.14. Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 31st August were 912,752 tons compared with 1,152,541 tons during the weekending the 24th August.&quot; [21723] b
Mineral imports were 277,929 tons, of which 211,296 tons were steel, scrapiron and iron-ore. Cereal imports were 121,660 tons, nine ships being fully loaded with grain. Other food imports totalled 62,660 tons, of which 20,675 tons wererefrigerated and tinned meat, 11,500 tons were sugar, and 1,720 tons were freshand tinned fruit. The total wine import for the week was 3,116 tons. Therewere also 383 tons of rum from the West Indies. Timber and pulp imports were134,600 tons.Enemy Intelligence.German.15. Photographic reconnaissance on the 4th September showed the battle-ship Bismarck at Hamburg and the 8-inch cruiser Seydlitz at Bremen.16. The chief concentration of German submarines remains in the North-West Approaches, where three or four have been maintained throughout theweek. Submarines apparently based on Lorient have been working in the cape verde Islands area and off the Spanish and Portuguese coasts and between there and the Azores. In general, there have been some eight or nine submarinesreported at sea, but on the 31st August there may have been as many as twelve.Intelligence relating to Possible Invasion.17. Photographic and other reconnaissance at Stavanger revealed no naval units and practically no shipping and no assembly of small craft. At Flushingthere was an increase of barges and 12 floating bridge sections newly arrived. a concentration of 70 small ships, average length 150 feet, was observed on the4th September. At Delfzijl there were 100 barges in harbour and 60 motor boatsmoving through the canal. At Zeebrugge there were 100 barges and a few small craft in harbour. At Ostend barges have increased to 100. There is no concen-tration of barges at Boulogne, but 50 motor boats have arrived. Six torpedo boats of German T Class are at Havre.Italian.18. H.M. Submarine Rainbow observed a force of three cruisers and oneor more destroyers at 11-55 a.m. on the 31st August about 40 miles E.S.E. of cape Spartivento steering eastwards, and at 12-30 p.m. on the same dayH.M. Submarine Parthian reported four enemy cruisers and five destroyers110 miles east of Cape Spartivento, which she attacked, apparently scoring twohits. At 3-12 p.m. on the 1st September a flying boat sighted a force consistingof two battleships, ten cruisers and fourteen destroyers 115 miles E.N.E. of CapeSpartivento, and from this and later reports it was clear that these ships were proceeding towards Taranto.19. An air reconnaissance of Leros was carried out on the 31st August andon Tripoli and eastern Sicilian harbours on the 1st September. there connaissance of Leros showed that there were four destroyers, seven submarines,a depot ship and about seven E-boats in Port Laki. At Tripoli there were two destroyers of Turbine and Nimbo Class. Except three small destroyers sighted inthe Straits of Messina no warships were seen in Sicilian harbours and only afew merchant ships.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.20. It has been reported that in the Oslo area four merchant ships and onetanker of 10,500 tons were sunk between the 18th and the 25th August. Anotherreport says that the German ships of over 1,200 tons and 12 knots which wererecalled to Germany about, the 17th August are still in German ports, and thatneutral ships hitherto laid up are gradually taking their places in the Baltictrade.The tanker Eurofeld, 5,947 tons, sailed from Teneriffe on the 3rd September.She was loaded with 6,000 tons of gas oil and 1,000 tons of fuel oil. TheNordeney, 3,667 tons, which is at Para, Brazil, is reported to be completing her crew with ratings from the Windhuk which is legally attached at Santos.
Italian.21. It has been reported that a new naval tanker, name not given, of14,500 tons dead weight left Fiume on the 28th August with an escort. It isthought that she was on acceptance trials. The charter of the tanker GwseppinaGhirarali, 3,319 tons, which has been trading in the Black Sea for several months,expired on the 28th August. It is understood that she will soon be leaving for italy. Three Italian ships, each of approximately 5,000 tons and one of them a tanker, are reported to have been put under Brazilian guard at Ceara. Partof the machinery of one of the ships is said to have been removed. The tankerArcola, which is at Teneriffe, has been authorised to discharge her cargo of 7,895tons of fuel oil to another, but unspecified tanker. The Duchessa D&apos;Aosta,,7,872 tons, which is at Fernando Po in the Gulf of Guinea, was reported on the29th August to be preparing to sail during the following forty-eight hours.Enemy Losses.22.   Since the outbreak of war a total of 260 enemy merchant ships of1,249,000 tons have been sunk, captured or destroyed.   Of this total 943,000 tons. were German, 272,500 tons Italian and 33,300 tons neutral, under enemy control.British Minelaying.23. On the 28th August H.M.S. Plover and the Dutch Vanderzann laid150 mines in the East Coast Barrier. The next day the 1st Minelaying Squadronlaid 2,000 mines in the East Coast Barrier.On the 4th September the three remaining ships of the 20th Flotilla laid80 mines in the Straits of Dover.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.24. The LL Trawler Royalo was sent to Mounfs Bay, Cornwall, todetonate the mines known to have been dropped there, and she exploded two onthe 30th August and one on the 31st August. The following day Royalo was mined and sunk while turning at the inshore end of a sweeping lap in rathershallow water.   Eleven of her crew were lost.Although the position had been repeatedly swept over by LL sweep, a smallDutch ship, which was wiped, was mined and sunk half a mile outside the Tyneon the 31st August.At Scapa Flow five mines were exploded by LL sweeps between the28th August and the 3rd September, making a total of eight exploded there bysweeps. These mines have been exploded in widely separated parts of the Flowand Sounds. Hoy Sound is still closed, and Hoxa Sound was closed for one dayas minelaying was suspected.H.M.S. Sunftsh having reported that four Heinkel aircraft had laid mines5 miles to the east of May Island in the Firth of Forth, Oropesa trawlerssearched the area 50 per cent, without result. The northbound convoy was safelyswept through, and a further search is being made.Eighteen magnetic mines have been swept during the week, but no moored mines.Fishguard, which has been closed every night since the 21st July owing tomines, resumed the running of normal traffic on the 2nd September.25. Following a report from one of our submarines that on the 30th Augustshe had fouled one or more moored mines about 48 miles west of Texel, north ofBrown Ridge, moored mines have been found about 45 miles west of Terschelling,which is a little to the north. Enemy vessels have been reported from time to time by our aircraft in this area. From these and earlier reports it is possible thatthe enemy is laying a mine barrage approximately between Texel and Yarmouth.U.S.S.R.New Construction.26. There is further evidence of the continuation of the Soviet Govern-menfs submarine programme in a reliable report that about twelve &quot; S &quot; classsubmarines are under construction at Gorki on the upper reaches of the Volga.
In addition to these at least three &quot; S &quot; class are under construction at Leningrad,and a new type, designated as &quot; K &quot; class, has recently appeared. This ispossibly an improved &quot;S&quot; or &quot;P&quot; class, of about 1,300 tons, with highendurance. At least six &quot; K &quot; class are known to have been completed andprobably three or four are under construction.The building of the small coastal &quot; M &quot; class of 188 tons also continues.MILITARY SITUATION.Africa.27. In East Africa the Italians are proceeding with the occupation of theMandera triangle (Kenya), and there has been, patrol activity at various placeson the Sudan frontier, notably northwards from Cassala, where the garrison hasbeen reinforced. It is not known whether the Libyan garrison has been reinforced,and there are still no indications of any German formations or units in the colony.Greece.28. During the past week preparations for the defence of the country against attack by Italy have been actively pursued. Although mobilisation hasnot yet been ordered for fear of provoking Italy, formations in Northern greece and probably Crete are believed to be at war strength and all anti-aircraft defenceshave been placed on a war footing.Yugoslavia.29. Preparations for defence against an attack by Italy continue. Theperiod of military service has been increased from eighteen months to two years.Bulgaria.30. The call-up of about 25,000 reservists for a period of training has raised the strength of the army to about 225,000. Preparations are being made to occupy the southern Dobruja up to the pre-1913 frontier line by the middle of September.United States.31. The United States Army is undergoing a rapid expansion. The regular(long service) army, from being a force of under 120,000 men three years ago,has now reached a strength of 303,000. The maximum strength at present authorised is 375,000.Personnel for the increase have been provided, so far as other ranks areconcerned, from volunteer enlistments. The Regular Army Reserve of about30,000 men has not been called up.Increases in officers have been met from the &quot;Organised Reserve&quot; somewhat similar to our Supplementary Reseiwe which had a strength of117,000 officers and about 3,000 other ranks. Some 9,000 officers have been called up for service up to one year, and it is probable that a further large number willbe required to train the men called up under the Conscription Act.32. The National Guard, which is a form of Militia, is to be called out for training for periods up to a year. The total number of men liable under theAct is nearly 250,000, but it is unlikely that all will, in fact, be called out.33. Under the Burke-Wadsworth Conscription Bill, which has now passed the Senate, men from 21 to 31 may be called up for military service for a period not to exceed one year in peace time. Not more than 900,000 men may be under training at a time.   It is expected that 400,000 will be called up in the autumn.(Note : Figures include the Army Air Corps.)Far East.34. In return for whatever facilities are granted, the French will presumablyreceive guarantees about the territorial integrity of Indo-China.The attitude of the third interested party China remains to be determined.The Chinese Government has, however, already announced its intention to take all necessary defensive measures, which may include the invasion of Indo-China,should French territory be used by the Japanese as a base of operations.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. Our bombing operations against Germany were on the same scale asin the previous week. The main objectives were aircraft factories, power stations and other industrial concerns engaged in the manufacture of armaments. targets in the Berlin area were again successfully attacked and several forests in germany were set on fire by incendiary bombs. Attacks were made on two nights onobjectives in Northern Italy.36. The scale of enemy attack on this country by day during the week under review was considerably greater than it was in the previous week, but by night it was slightly smaller. Attacks were chiefly against aerodromes by day and industry by night, though some damage was inflicted on aircraft and otherfactories in daylight and aircraft production will be affected, though not seriously.Attacks on aerodromes have achieved no important results.37. As already described, Naval units in the Mediterranean are meeting with considerable success in repelling air attacks, and the Fleet Air Arm haveattacked aerodromes in Sicily and the Dodecanese. Aerodromes in Libya andthe port of Assab have been heavily attacked by our medium bombers.Great Britain.38. About twice as many aircraft were employed by the enemy in daylight attacks as in the previous week. The raids were generally of a mass characterby large formations and were repeated two or three times daily. These daylightoperations have been mainly directed against aerodromes, especially those in theSouth-East of England. The attacks were particularly heavy on the 30th andthe 31st August and on the 2nd September, the enemy employing between 600 and800 aircraft on each of these days. On one day only, the 31st August, was anyextensive damage done, but the three aerodromes concerned were soon madeserviceable again. On the afternoon of the 4th September an attack was madeon Vickers-Armstrong aircraft factory at Weybridge, Surrey, which was seriously damaged, and heavy casualties were incurred. The majority of the enemy aircraft which took part in this attack were destroyed.39. The heaviest attacks again developed from the South-East. A feature of the enemy5 s tactics towards the end of the week was the increasing strengthof the fighter escorts, in spite of which, however, his formations have been successfully intercepted and dispersed by our fighters. Short-range dive bombershave not reappeared. One of our squadrons was particularly successful on the4th September, when it destroyed fifteen enemy aircraft during one patrol, withoutsustaining any casualties. Czech and Polish pilots took their part in thefighting. On each of two days during the week the Czech squadron destroyedsix enemy aircraft, and Polish pilots shot down five during a single patrol.40. The enemy&apos;s night attacks have again been concentrated on industrial targets, especially in the Midlands, South Wales, Yorkshire and Lancashire, butbombs have been dropped indiscriminately in other parts of the country. TheLondon Area was raided on four nights of the week, but the attacks appeared tobe aimless except on the night of the 4th-5th September, when bombs were dropped on the London Docks. Pires were started but they were soon under control. The number of enemy aircraft engaged in night operations have variedbetween 150 and 310, including about 40 employed each night oh minelaying roundour coasts.41. Fighter Command flew 1,103 patrols involving 5,513 sorties during theweek, and again not only dispersed the enemy formations but inflicted heavy casualties, details of which are given in Appendix V.Enemy Territory in Europe.42. Bomber Command flew 98 day and 557 night sorties during the week,and aircraft of Coastal Command also took part in operations. Owing to lackof cloud cover, daylight operations were restricted to two days, when objectives[21723] . c
were mainly aerodromes in Holland. Night bombing attacks generally followed the same lines as those of the previous week, and the following operations were carried out in spite of poor visibility.43. Attacks on targets in the Berlin area were repeated, and the Germancapital was visited on four nights during the week. Two large gas works, twoelectric power stations and the Siemens and Halske factory, all in Berlin,apparently suffered considerable damage and large fires were started. Direct hits were also made on the Tempelhof aerodrome and on the Henschel aircraft factory. Other targets which were successfully attacked include aero-engineworks at Munich, aluminium works at Bitterfeld, magneto works at Stuttgart, an aircraft factory at Leipzig, an explosives factory at Schlebusch, near Dusseldorf,and various oii installations and marshalling yards.44. Our medium bombers carried out attacks on several aerodromes, on ships at Emden, on gun emplacements at Cape Gris Nez and on barges in the canalsin Holland and Belgium,&apos; but results were difficult to observe. Seven medium bombers attacked Ostend Harbour and registered a number of direct hits.45. A feature of the week&apos;s operations was the incendiary attacks on the black Forest, the Thuringian Forest, Grunewald Forest, near Berlin, and onforest areas in the Harz Mountains. It is reported that these attacks were very successful and extensive fires were started, a number of explosions indicating thepresence of ammunition dumps.46. A light scale of attack was maintained against Northern Italy. TheFiat works at Turin, the Marelli magneto works at Sesto San Giovanni and objectives in Genoa were again successfully attacked, and a direct hit was obtained on the railway bridge at Alessandria.North Sea and Coastal.47. During the week 593 sorties and 146 convoy escorts were flown by coastal Command in addition to the usual routine patrols in the North Sea andin Scottish waters. There were many photographic reconnaissances extendingfrom the Baltic to the Bay of Biscay. On the 29th August five Blenheims of bomber Command attacked a large concentration of shipping between TexelIsland and Den Helder, but it was impossible to observe results. On the30th August three Coastal Command Blenheims successfully bombed shipping and the jetty at Den Helder in spite of intense anti-aircraft fire, and on the3rd September a Hudson bombed a merchant vessel 20 miles North-West of Texel,a direct hit being made just aft of the bridge.48. Enemy bomber-reconnaissance aircraft continue to be employed on an extensive scale, and numerous photographic reconnaissances have been made. Thenumber of weather flights carried out each day has increased, and the recon-naissance and weather flights over the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic have become a daily occurrence. German short-range reconnaissance aircraft carried out dailyreconnaissances off the West Coast of France and North Coast of Spain, and werereporting coastal shipping. Enemy minelaying aircraft were very active in areasoff the East and South coasts, Western Approaches, Bristol Channel and in liverpool Bay, and numerous reconnaissance flights were made by coastal typeaircraft over the North Sea. Increasing numbers are being used in connectionwith the sea rescue service, and it is very probable that they are being used forminelaying.Middle East and Mediterranean.Malta.49. Only one air attack was made by the enemy on Malta during the week.Attacks on British naval units have already been described. That on the 2ndSeptember was carried out by six Ju. 87&apos;s escorted by fifteen fighters.Egypt and Libya.50. On the 31st August thirty -seven Blenheims attacked the principalaerodromes and landing grounds in Eastern Libya and bombs were seen to fallamong aircraft and on camps.  At least six enemy aircraft were destroyed and
others were damaged. Our aircraft were engaged by enemy fighters, but they all returned safely.Sudan and East Africa.51. The principal attack of the week was that made on Assab on the1st September by twenty-one Blenheims. Direct hits were made on the two jetties,on warehouses and on the military barracks, and a petrol dump was set on fire.All our aircraft returned safely. On the following day the jetties and warehouses1$ were again attacked, but results were not observed. It was seen, however, thatthe fire started on the previous day was still burning fiercely. Other successful attacks were those made on the Agorat aerodromes on the 30th August, and onthe railway station and enemy camp at Aiscia, 65 miles north-west of DJibuti,on the 4th September.52. Nacfa, 100 miles north-west of Massawa, was attacked by our aircraft on the 31st August, and the military barracks at Kassala, and enemy mechanisedtroops at Buna and Ajao on the 3rd September, but the results of these attackscould not be observed.Aden.53. On the 4th September three enemy aircraft attacked shipping, twelvebombs falling in the outer harbour without effect. One aircraft was damaged by our fighters.Air Intelligence.Germany.54. A considerable part of the long-range bomber strength has been removed from Norway during the last week.Italy.55. Aircraft from the Dodecanese have been carrying out regularreconnaissance flights over Corfu and the Greek Islands in the iEgean Sea.Reports that Italian reconnaissance aircraft have recently flown over NorthernGreece are denied by the Chief of the Greek Air Staff.56. The air reinforcement of Libya continues and a further contingent of42 fighters and 32 bombers is expected in the near future. Six bombersendeavoured to fly to East Africa from Benghazi, but missed their refuelling base at Auenat and landed in the desert, where they were eventually located.57. Air attacks on Kassala, Massawa, Assab and Asmara are having aconsiderable moral effect on the native population, many of whom are said to beevacuating these towns and taking refuge either abroad or in the interior.Madagascar.58. It is reported that 150 French aircraft now in Algeria are to be moved to Madagascar. French Air Force units in Madagascar have hitherto consistedonly of six obsolete general-purpose aircraft, and the transfer of so large anumber of modern aircraft to the colony would mark a striking departure in french colonial policy.Syria.59. A reliable report states that the Italian Armistice Commission isalready trying to persuade the High Commissioner to allow the bulk of the French air Force in Syria to be flown out of the country, presumably to Libya or the dodecanese. If this report is true, it is likely that the Commission will meet with at least temporary resistance.Roumania.60. On the 27th August a Hungarian bomber crossed the Roumanianfrontier near Sacueni. It was attacked by a Roumanian fighter and forced towithdraw, some of the crew being wounded. On the following day anotherHungarian aircraft bombed the aerodrome at Satu Mare.   It was forced down
by A.A. fire and the crew arrested. In addition to these two incursions,Hungarian aircraft flew over Roumania as far as Brasov and Someseni, whereleaflets were dropped. Incidents have also occurred on the Bessarabian frontier,in which two Roumanian fighters were shot down by the Russians.HOME SECURITY.General Review.61. The main objectives of enemy day attacks appear in most cases to havebeen the aerodromes of Kent and the Thames Estuary; but the aircraft industry has also suffered. Systematic machine-gunning of civilians is reported fromWareham and also from the Scilly Islands, where earlier reports of severe panicamong the inhabitants have since proved to have been exaggerated.62. By night, industry has remained the chief target and attacks havebeen continued by single aircraft or by small forces. London has been visited onsix nights; Lancashire and Liverpool on four occasions; Bristol three times and birmingham only once. Activity in South Wales was less than in the previousweek.Damage.Industry.63. The following aircraft factories have been hit. Damage was sustainedat Armstrong Vickers Works, Weybridge, in a daylight raid. Production hasbeen reduced to 35 per cent, of normal this week. There were 61 workers killed and 300 injured. The Rollason Aircraft factory was again hit and completely destroyed, and S. Smith and Sons, Instrument Makers, Cricklewood, alsosustained damage.64. Vauxhall Motor Works at Luton were damaged as a result of a daylightraid and were closed down for a short period. Iron and Steel Works at Bilstonand Briton Ferry received damage by night.65. The National Oil Refineries at Llandarcy were badly damaged, threecisterns being fired and at Altrincham a fire was started, but put out after afew hours.66. A large flour mill was seriously damaged involving the loss of 8,000 tonsof wheat.Road and Rail Communications.67. There have been twenty-two reports of minor interference with railway traffic, of which four were due to unexploded bombs. The great majority of linesaffected were soon in full operation. Road blocks have occurred, also largely due to unexploded bombs, but have caused no serious inconvenience.Civilian Casualties.68. The civilian casualties during the week ending 0600 hours, the 4thSeptember, are approximately as follows : Killed. Seriously Injured.       Slightly Injured.469 906 892The chief incidence of casualties has been : Killed.    Seriously SlightlyBy Day  Wounded. Injured.Luton    .........      59 59 92Orpington        ......      48 28 ...By Night Swansea ......      33 35 52Liverpool ......      32 68 104Note. The casualties at Weybridge are not included in these totals.
Unexploded Bombs.69. At two places in Wales delay-action bombs have exploded, killing fivepeople in one case and three in the other. Cases have been reported in whichbombs have exploded after 136 hours, ten days and eleven days. It is believedthat this exaggerated delay is due to some technical fault.

APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.THE following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Hamburg. An asphalt works and the Continental rubber factory have been destroyed.   Rhenania Ossag Mineralolwerke was hit and fires started.Kiel.- Considerable damage has been caused among the shipyards and jettiesand to industrial plants. Military units are now accommodated in private houses and schools have been converted into ammunition depots.Ludwigshaven-Oppau.- The I.G. Farben is seriously damaged.Hanover. As a result of the damage done to the Continental Gummiwerkerubber factory there is a serious shortage of rubber tyres in Germany.France.The raids on oil installations in the Bordeaux area have caused enormousdamage, and provisional estimates give the loss as 100,000 tons of benzine, 2,600barrels of kerosin, 1,500 barrels of diesel oil, and 3,600 barrels of crude fuel oil.At Bee d&apos;Ambes photographs now disclose that three large tanks are destroyed and five others possibly damaged.Norway.Reports indicate that the effect of British raids is beneficial to the morale ofthe Norwegian population, and that there is a desire on their part to do something to help the Allied cause, although they are impotent to do so at the moment.Italy.Damage.It is reported by reliable observers in Italy that, as the result of Royal AirForce raids on Northern Italy, the Caproni factory at Milan is partly in ruins,and a large part of the Fiat factory in Turin has been destroyed. previous reports that the station at Milan was destroyed, however, are now denied by the rome correspondent of the Associated Press, who passed through that city onthe 27th August.The anxiety of the Italian authorities to suppress information with regardto the effect of raids is indicated by their employment of special contractors to clear up the damage before journalists are allowed to visit the bombed areas,and to their refusal to allow a Roumanian air liner to proceed from Venice toMilan on the 28th August, on the pretext that the aerodrome in the latter citywas &quot;unsafe.&quot;Morale.Reports from well-placed sources in Italy indicate that frequent raids on italy on an effective scale may well encourage a serious movement in favour ofpeace, in spite of German pressure and intiuence. In the areas already bombedthere seems little doubt that a state of panic has been caused. Anti-war feeling-is apparently particularly strong in Genoa. Unemployment is rife, and there is general discontent at the inadequacy of the city&apos;s defences. Those who can afford to do so have already evacuated, while the poorer people are apparently driven byfear of air raids to seek shelter in tunnels at about 4 o&apos; clock in the afternoon and to remain in them until the following morning under most unsatisfactory and unhygienic conditions.
