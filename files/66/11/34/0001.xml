This is being explored by Mr. Morris Wilsonand there is a possibility that the Reconstruction finance corporation will put up the capital expenditure if theU.K. programme can be co-ordinated with that for U.S. defenceso as to ensure production of common types of aircraftunder a joint plan.      If this should be practicable, theU.K. share of the capital costs will be amortised and spreadover the contracts, whilst the administration of the schemev/ill have the co-operation and backing of the U.S.administratively ion,,(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJT3STY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)..,

The types of aircraft to be made are underdiscussion with the U.S. authorities.
