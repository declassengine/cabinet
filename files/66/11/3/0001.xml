THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST Y*S GOVERNMENTSECEET.PEOPOSAL TO SEND FLYING TEAINING SCHOOLS ABEOAD.Memorandum.WE are informed that a proposal has been put forward to send flying training Schools abroad, to Canada and elsewhere.2. It will be impossible in the ordinary course for the Ministry of aircraft production to service the airplanes or to supply them with spares.3. At the present moment, there is a shortage of spares in Britain. until this shortage has been made up, the most extreme pressure must be put upon the factories and workshops and all other production units.4. Even when this shortage has been disposed of, another considerable delaymust follow, as the shipment of spares abroad is a process which will occupy aperiod of two or even three months. This factor will, in effect, involve thelocking up of a large proportion of spares, amounting to perhaps one-sixth ofthe total.5. Engine spares, now in even higher demand than aircraft spares, cannotbe expedited in sufficient quantities for despatch abroad for a long time to come.6. This applies especially to Cheetah engine spares. These will be very short in a few weeks when large numbers of engines must be overhauled and demands for spares begin to accumulate.7. It is pointed out that, even if any spares could be shipped abroad, thereis no possibility of accumulating extensive stores for a long time to come.8. On that account, the ratio of 50 per cent, of idle training aircraft, whichis the standard heretofore accepted by the A.M.S.O., must be considerablyexceeded.9. It will be wise to assume that on account of the difficulties of the sparessituation, the 50 per cent, ratio will rise to 70 per cent, or even higher. So that, inorder to maintain the requisite number of trainers in service, we must anticipatea shipment of something like twice the total of aircraft which it would normally be thought necessary to supply.10. Another reason why the ratio of unserviceable aircraft will steadilyrise is the divorce of the training units from the aircraft industry and its trained personnel. For only by depending on the skilled labour from the factories hasthe 50 per cent, ratio been maintained.11. The units will also be divorced from the assistance of the technical staffof the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Eecently Masters developed a technicaldefect. And it was only by the devoted labours of the technicians of the Ministryof Aircraft Production that Masters were restored to use. In stations abroadthis expert advice will not be available and defects may destroy whole seriesof aircraft.12. For the servicing of the aircraft abroad an immense number ofmechanics will be required. But it is impossible to spare them from this country at present. They are needed here. . The engine repair system which we have built up would fail if these men were taken away. And technicians cannot be foundin Canada, where there is a shortage. Moreover, Canadian technicians wouldhave to be trained in the types of engine they would be required to deal with.That process would take a long time.[21660]

It is therefore our conclusion that the scheme proposed by the AirMinistry imposes on us various problems which we are quite unable to solve,and the production of this excessive quantity of spares must seriously damage the production line in the aircraft and engine factories of Britain.(Signed) BEAVERBROOK.J.
