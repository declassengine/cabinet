Our programme of small craft must face this new situation and also make allowance for the probability that, so long as the war lasts, threats of attempted invasion will remain with us.Finally, we cannot exclude from our calculations the danger of thepossible deterioration of our relations with Japan.2.       ROYAL SOVEREIGN Class. -       &apos;Before making my proposals, I should say that careful considerationhas been given to the suggestion made by the Prime Minister that the ROYALSOVEREIGN Class should be re-armoured.    It has been found, however, that eachship would be out of action for the better part of 18 months-) for 9 of whicha Capital Ship dock would be occupied.   From an operational point of view,therefore, the scheme must   unfortunately be regarded as impracticable.The enemy is now established at ports   cn the Atlantic and theThe main approach routes for our convoys are now within attackingFurther the defection of France has permanently increased  t&amp;JL

pote cm capita shi? program e.11Gt.Britain.(4 New 14&quot;12 NELSONSThere are at present under construction 4 - 14&quot; capital ships, namely:-GEORGE V and PRINCE OP 7/iLES of 1936 Programme.DUKE OP PORK   and ANSON of 1937 Programme.2. The following have &quot;been suspended or deferred:-HOWE - of 1937 Programme.LION and TSIPERAIRE of 1933 Programme.OOHQIIEROR and THDKEEEBR of 1939 Programme.TiilfGUilED (a 15&quot; ship) of 1940 Programme, which it isproposed to order in March 1941.3. In addition to the new Ships under construction we have at present the following modernized ships;-2 NELSONS3 QUEElN ELIZABETHS1 EELTOttTT,Also &apos;   1 HOOD which can be included in this category.4. The 2 3AEHMS, 1 REPULSE and 4 ROYAL SOVEREIGNS whichhave not been modernized are deficient in gun range^ deckprotection.^ under water sub-division and. in the case of theROYAL SOVEREIGNS in speed.There are no similar ships belonging to Italy or Japan,who have Tooth modernized all their Capital Ships.To simplify the tables which follow, the unmodernizedships have been left out of the picture.5.

The above picture, which is based upon the evidence ofair reconnaissance and is unsupported by any intelligence reports,represents the most favourable aspect for ourselves.&apos;    It could be changed for the worse should we lose any S^j^ieHg if Germany hasmanaged to conceal the laying down and construction of BattleshipsH and I and would be further changed for the worse if Italy and japan should how lay down more capital ships and&apos; hasten their construction
to complete &quot;before the end of 1944.     Acting on the assumption,however, that the above figures are correct:As regards Giermany and Italy.Even if we go on with HOWE we shall find ourselves in1943 with only 5 new ships against 6 new Battleships and 2 newBattle Cruisers of Germany and Italy.The only way we can prevent this unsatisfactory positioncontinuing is to complete LION,   TEMERAIRE and VANGUARD.     LIONand VANGUARD can be completed in 1944, hut TEMERAIRE   cannot becompleted before June, 1945.Even then we shall only achieve parity in new ships withGermany and Italy, by June 1945, assuming no further constructionon their part.Hence it is essential to lay dorm also CONQUEROR andTHUNDERER as soon as possible.As regards JapanIf we complete H0T7E, LION, TI13RAIEE and VANGUARD bythe middle of 1945 even allowing Japan does not complete any ships in 1944, the situation will be;-We shall have 8 New B.S.    4-7 Modernized = 15.Whilst Japan will have       5 New Large B.S.5 New Small B.C.10&quot; Modernized Cap,Ships        ^ 20.Hence it is again necessary to lay down also CONQUERORand TI-IUNDERER,The new small Japanese Battle Cruisers are of the pocketbattleship type with 9 twelve inch guns with a displacement of some-16,000 to 20,000 tons..To deal with these ships on the Trade Routes it wouldbe necessary to detach our Battle  Cruisers from the Main Fleet.
