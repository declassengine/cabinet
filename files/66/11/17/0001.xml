REPORT FROM THE CHAIRMAN.OF THE NORTH AMERICANSUpM^^cWmITTEE?&apos; TO TEE&quot; MINISTER WITHOUT.. portfolio.At their meeting this morning the North American supply committee considered the present position of our &quot;munitions -programme (excluding aircraft) in North America0      It is&quot;briefly as follows:-1. The Ministry of Supply have already placed, -a-s-authorised, orders in North America for (a) a large variety of articles with a total value of  16.3 millions, and(b) 1,500 m3 tanks and 1,500 2 pdrc tank guns, and havefurnished an estimate of additional requirements of standard types of weapons amounting to ah out  L\3 mill ions oThe Admiralty requirements f-;r naval stores not orderedthrough the Ministry of Supply and thus included in the ahovefigures amount to about  13^ millions, excluding any allowance for merchant ship &quot;buildingo20 A large proportion of the ahove requirements is for essential standard weapons of war, such as tanks., field guns,A.Ao guns, Anti-tank guns and small arms, and the greaterpart is &quot;being ordered from the U-SoAo3. These figures indicate the general magnitude of the task of the British Purchasing Commission,     Its greatestdifficulties arise, however, where priority is involvedoLarge quantities of machine tools, gun forginjsand other material essential to our armament production here arerequired from North America and in particular the U^S-A.There will therefore he competition between the requirementsof these materials for production in the United Kingdom, andin the. D.S.A, for the requirements of tho Un8.A0 armamentprogramme and our own respectively0h&quot; Our programme in the United States needs, for thefollowing reasons, to he closely co-ordinated, and indeedintegrated, with that of the United States Government, asemphasised &quot;by recent cahles from MrQ Purvis; -(a) The United States Administration are now going ahead with their own re-armament programmes&quot;The United States armament production and bhedisposal of essential ra?/ materials, machine toolspetco, are now controlled and directed entirely &quot;bythe United States Administration&quot;s the formerthrough the Defence Advisory Committee and the.latter &quot;by means of an export licensing systemv(b) The Defence Advisory Committee has informed theBritish Purchasing Commission that they attach importance to &quot;such an allocation of UnitedKingdom orders on hand (including the orderstaken over from the French) in the United states as would satisfy to the best advantage the UnitedKingdom war needs and the United States defenceneeds&quot;, and that while export licences for machine tools for the completion of existingplant will he obtainable &quot;the exportation of complete lines of new equipment will dependentirely on the strength of the case presented by us&quot;.

(c)    &quot;The j^oard is also determined that American,production shall he concen&amp;O-ted on certain types of weapons and aeroplanes and is,therefore, firmly opposed to allocations of productive capacity to a number of types of equivalent weapons&quot;.     It also &quot;now declinesits permission for further industrial contactsuntil the question of common types is settled&quot;*It will also be noted that &quot;the plant for producing weapons and munitions of all kinds,whether for Navy, Army and Air use, is controlled by the same Board and by the sameindividuals and that they are pre-occupied with the achievement of a well balancedindustrial production,,&quot;50 If we can agree promptly with the United states administration on common types of weapons, we are advised that we may obtain the following advantages(a) We may save dollar expenditure by taking advantage of the suggestion previously made to,I and reported by, Mr. Purvis that the UnitedStates Administration might finance the capitalexpenditure in connection with any jointprogramme0(b) We may obtain United States consent to grantUnited Kingdom priorities on deliveries, and asthe plans for production give the United Statesa greater sense of security, we may increase thepossibilities of further releases from stocks.6^       Negotiations in connection with the above problemswill be extremely delicate and difficult, particularly onthe questions of common types and priorities.     these negotiations cannot be satisfactorily conducted by telegramand we are advised that a successful conclusion of such negotiations can only be expected if we are prepared to takethe United States Administration into our confidence and put before them a complete picture of our position and ourrequirementsoRecommendation.7* The North American Supply Committee recommend, there-fore, that Sir Walter Layton, who is Director of Programmesat the Ministry of Supply and whom the Minister of Supply is willing to release for this purpose, should be entrusted- withthe task of conducting these negotiations in the United Statesof America and should be asked to go there as soon as possible,accompanied by the necessary experts*     A draft of the generalinstructions which the North American Supply committee recommend the War Cabinet to approve for Sir Walter Laytonis attached (Annex).     Immediately upon approval, Sir WalterLayton will be asked to get into touch with the supply departments and the Treasury for the more detailed instructxnsreferred to in the draft.8. The North American Supply Committee hope that thesepreparations can be concluded in.time for Sir Walter Laytonto go to America by the next flying boat.(Signed)      arthur Salter.88th AUGUST,  1940.
