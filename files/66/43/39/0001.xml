I Copy No.W.P. (43) 539.27th November, 1943.WAR CABINET,MAN-POWER POLICY TOR 1944.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.- AT a Conference of Ministers on the 5th November, it was decided to appoint a Committee of Officials, under the Chairmanship of Sir Robert Sinclair, to frame proposals for the allocation of man-power in 1944 on the basis of theassumption set out in paragraph 5 (a) of a Memorandum which had been circulatedby the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (W.P. (43) 490). At the same time a Ministerial Committee, consisting of The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Production,The Paymaster-General,was appointed to consider the broad principles involved in this investigation andto give such guidance as might be necessary to the Official Committee.2. The Official Committee have presented their Report, which is attachedto this Memorandum. The Ministerial Committee endorse the general planpresented in the Report, subject to the following modifications :  (a) Navy. At the conference on the 5th November the Prime Ministerexpressed the view that the Navy should be stabilised at approximately its present strength; and the allocation of 40,000 proposed in the Report of the official committee represented the numbers required to stabilise the strength of the Navyat 750,000. The First Lord of the Admiralty has, however, informed us that,according to his latest calculations, the Navy needs 67,200 in 1944 if it is to meet all the commitments planned for that year.We recommend that the allocation of men for the Navy should be increased from 40,000 (as proposed by the Official Committee) to 50,000, the additional10,000 being provided in the second half of the year.We also recommend that the Admiralty and the Air Ministry should arrange that, out of the proposed allocation for the R.A.F., up to 17,000 men should be trained during 1944 in such a way that they could be used in 1945 either in theR.A.F. or in the Fleet Air Arm. If the basic assumption is realised and germany is defeated by the end of 1944, the needs of the Fleet Air Arm will be greater.If, on the other hand, war with Germany continues into 1945, our full deploymentagainst Japan will necessarily be delayed and these men could be used more effectively in the R.A.F. If a plan on these lines can be devised, it will secure a double insurance for a single premium.We consider that these two recommendations should together meet the sub-stance of the First Lord&apos;s demands on behalf of the Navy.(b) Merchant Navy. The Minister of War Transport has represented that,if wastage is to be met in full and crews found for all the additional tonnage which may become available in 1944, the Merchant Navy will need an intake of25,000 as compared with the 15,000 proposed in the Report.The strain on man-power in 1944 will be such that this demand cannot bemet in full. We recommend, however, that the intake proposed for the merchant navy should.be raised from 15,000 to 20,000, the additional 5,000 being provided in the second half of the year. (This would have the effect of raising the net increase proposed by the Official Committee from 10,000 to 15,000.)[264831 b
(c) Coalmining. The Official Committee proposed for coalmining an intake of 30,000 men to be supplied by the machinery of call-up under the NationalService Acts. Their Report contemplated that as a result there would be a net increase in the labour force of the coalmining industry of 9,000 in the first half,and 8,000 in the second half, of 1944. This would bring the labour force up to717,000 by the end of the year.We have ascertained that the arrangements for the training of men called up for the coalmines can be brought into effect more rapidly than had beensupposed at the time when the Report of the Official Committee was written.This means that a higher proportion of the intake from the call-up can be drafted into the mines in the early part of 1944. Further, the figure of 717,000did not take full account of the arrangements made for further releases of ex-miners from the Army. We are satisfied that, as a result of all the measures now proposed, the labour force of the coal-mining industry can be raised to720,000 soon after the beginning of the coal year in May and maintained atthat level throughout the rest of 1944.(d) Civil Defence. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security is unable himself to take the responsibility for accepting the reduction of 50,000in the Civil Defence Services which is proposed in the Report of the official committee.We consider that, if man-power poticy for 1944 is to be framed on theassumption set out in paragraph 5 (a) of W.P. (43) 490, some substantial reduction must be made in the strength of the Civil Defence Services; and wethink it reasonable to set this reduction at about 50,000.We recommend, however, that this reduction should take place between 1st April and 30th September. 1944, and not (as the Official Committee recom-mended) in the first half of the year.3. Global allocations have been suggested in the Report for industries and services in Groups II and III; but, apart from the special cases of coal-mining,Merchant Navy, inland transport and the nursing and hospital services, no attempt has been made to distribute the man-power available, or to apportionthe necessary cuts, among the industries and services in these groups.We recommend that the detailed allocations should be settled under oursupervision as soon as the broad lines of man-power policy for 1944 have beendecided by the War Cabinet.4. In paragraph 18 of the Report proposals are made regarding theadministrative machinery required to effect the suggested redistribution ofman-power.   We recommend that these proposals be approved.5. The Minister of Production proposes to arrange for the Joint war production Staff to consider the major problems of relating war production tostrategical needs, on the basis of the man-power policy for 1944 proposed in thisReport. We assume that all the requirements of the Services for munitions and stores will be adjusted as closely as possible to the needs, having regard to the new rates of intake now proposed.6. The allocations proposed in the Report are separated into two periods of six months, because of the greater importance of ensuring the Service intakes inthe first half of 1944. We recommend that the position should be reviewed inMay 1944, and that the allocations now proposed for the second half of the year should then be reconsidered.We believe that, when this review is undertaken, it may prove possible torecommend that during the second half of 1944 further labour should be madeavailable, at the expense of some of the munitions industries, for industries and services supplying civil needs. Plans for this should be formulated between now and May next so that they could then be put into operation without delay if thesituation warranted it.7. Our recommendations for the redistribution of man-power in 1944 are shown in the following Table.

MAN-POWER 1944.Report of the Official Committee.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.1. To ensure maximum effort in 1944 without obviously unreasonable risk inthe event of the war against Germany continuing into or through 1945, aminimum intake for the Services of 240,000 men and 34,000 women is required.Of these, 170,000 men and 33,000 women are needed in the first six months.2. Certain essential industries and services (in Group II) must have somenet increase. We consider that the merchant navy, coal mining, and transport should have net increases totalling 62,000 men, of whom 34,000 should come in thefirst six months. For other industries and services requiring net increases (e.g.,National Government, agriculture, nursing and hospital domestic service) wesuggest allocations of 48,000 in Group II and 25,000 in Group III.3. In view of these requirements and the estimated decline of 150,000 inthe total man-power available for industry, we must plan in the Supply and otherDepartments&apos; programmes (including Civil Defence) for net reductions aggre-gating 534,000, of which 350,000 should be effective in the first six months. Ofthe net reduction over the year, 138,000 must be in Group III industries and services. Part of this will occur as a result of continuing existing policy in respectof these industries, while further reductions will be possible as a result of reduceddemands by the Services for their products.4. The statement on the opposite page shows the distribution proposed to achieve a statistical balance.   Original demands exceeded supply by 1,290,000.5. The estimate, so far as it has been possible to make it, of the risks involved if the war with Germany continues beyond the end of 1944, is containedin an Appendix to this Report.6. It is broadly true that, given the limitations on naval strength referredto in the Note below, no larger intake into the Services would increase the effectiveness of our military effort in 1944 because of the deficiencies in materielwhich would result from the withdrawal of more men from reserved occupationswithin the munitions and essential industries.7. We emphasise the importance of the allocations for the first half of1944 being regarded as firm, and those for the second half being made subject to revision at the beginning of May.8. In view of the time required to deploy forces against the Japanese, theseproposals would not involve any reduction of our planned impact against japan in 1945, save possibly in the extent of our Naval effort.Note.-The statements in this Summary are dependent upon certainhypotheses stated in the Report; in particular, attention is called tothe fact that on the guidance of the Ministerial Committee, pendingany contrary instructions from the Prime Minister as the result of theFirst Lorchs review, we have worked on the basis of an emd-1944 strengthof 750,000 men for the Navy, and have regarded our allocation asconditioned by this ruling. In the judgment of the Admiralty, this figure is some 15,000 less than the minimum with which, given strictesteconomy, they could hope to fulfil present plans. A still larger increase would be necessary to fulfil literally the condition of maximumimpact&quot; (see paragraph 10 of the Report).

Report.1. The Committee was constituted at a Conference of Ministers on the5th November, with the following Terms of Reference : (a) Forthwith to work out in the light of the discussion at the Conferenceof Ministers on the 5th November a possible solution of the 1944 man-power problem on the assumption for the purpose of our man-powerplans that our maximum effort must be made in 1944 and thatGermany will be defeated by the end of that year; and(b) in presenting the picture under this assumption to give an indication of what our situation would be in 1945, if the war with Germanycontinued during that year.2. The points relevant to our problem which were made in discussion at theConference of Ministers on the 5th November were : (a) That as regards the Services (i) The Prime Minister &apos;s view was that the strength of the navy should be stabilised at 722,000 men. The First Lord felt itwould be necessary to review the extent to which their taskscould be carried out with the reduced man-power.(ii) That on this assumption a workable figure for Army intake wouldbe 150,000 men.(iii) That subject to a review in the light of the relationship betweenoutput of planes and R.A.F. strength, something like50,000 men could be found for the RA.F.(b) That it was the intention that super-priority for the Ministry of aircraft production programme should lapse at the end of 1943 and that there-after we should aim to keep Ministry of Aircraft Production at thelevel reached on that date.These points were not recorded as Conclusions, and we have not thereforeregarded them as decisions but rather as guides to the way in which the minds of Ministers were working.3. &quot;Maximum effort in 1944 &quot; required definition and the ministerial committee approved the following : &quot; Maximum effort in 1944 &quot; shall be taken for this purpose as meaningthe application of the maximum impact on Germany in 1944 while fulfillingso far as they are already planned to be fulfilled in 1944 our agreed contri-bution to operations against the Japanese.4. The Ministerial Committee stressed the importance of having a provisional picture of the position at the earliest possible date even though certaindetailed adjustments have to be made later. The Minister of Labour stated thatthe general plan for 1944 must be framed without delay and that much of thepreparatory work can be done as soon as he has a rough idea, of the general scale of thj man-power movement which would be required in 1944.5. Acting on that guidance we have approached the problem in thefollowing way : (a) We have ascertained the Service needs for the maximum effort in 1944.(b) We  have  obtained,   through consultation  between  members  of  theCommittee and the Supply Departments, estimates so far as they canbe given in the time, of the consequential effect on labour requirements.(c) We have given consideration to the risks involved for 1945 under the basic assumption, but are yet unable, for reasons that are explained,to present a complete statistical picture of these risks in terms of the1945 effort if Germany is not defeated by the end of 1944. these risk are indicated in the Appendix.(d) We then proceeded to frame what we consider to be the best possibleallocation for 1944. This allocation, we suggest, should be regardedas reasonably firm for the first six months and provisional for thesecond six months.ie) We have considered the means whereby the proposed, allocations shouldbe carried out, having regard to the decision to terminate overridingpreference for the aircraft programme by the end of 1943.
6.   In framing our proposals we have assumed (a) that under no circumstances could we reduce reserves below the levelrequired for the war against Japan;(&amp;) that research and development must go on;(c) that some production must continue, or be started, of new weapons thatwould be essential if we were not to be outclassed by Germany if theassumption was falsified,;(d) that some risks could be taken as regards long-term projects not in category (c);(e) that at least a minimum scale of training establishments should becontinued.7. The logical consequence of applying the assumption that the war would end in 1944 to the programmes of the Ministry of Supply and M.A.P. is thattowards the end of the year there would be substantial reductions in the labour force of the munitions industries as the level of production came down towardsthat required for the Japanese war. This labour would be available far too late in the year to be used by the Services against Germany and would be surplus to their requirements against Japan. We should therefore be faced with anecessity for expanding our non-munition programmes before the German war was finally concluded. At the same time we should have greatly increased the risks if the assumption were falsified. We have therefore proposed to take outof the munition industries in the second half of the year the minimum necessaryto meet other manpower demands. In consequence the risk in the Supply field which would arise if the assumption were falsified is greatly reduced. We have proposed, that the position should be reviewed in May.8. In the following paragraphs we set out the allocations proposed for theServices and industry, and indicate in each case the estimated consequences,if the assumption (of maximum effort in 1944 resulting in the end of the warwith Germany in that year) were fulfilled.9.

This question can well be dealt with when the position is reviewed in May.f Exclusive of men recruited and trained for the Merchant Navy, numbering about 1,800*per annum.% This figure represents the strength at the beginning of the year plus gross intake pluswounded men returned to duty, less gross wastage during the year. It understates the actualstrength of the Army at end-1944 to the extent of the increase during 1944 in the number ofwounded men who have not returned to duty. The decline of 85,000 in 1944 shows the approximate decline in the estimated number of effectives.[26483] d
Estimated consequences of the allocations to the Services.10. Navy. The allocation of men in 1944 is that needed to give a strengthof 750,000 by the end of the year. The Admiralty state that this is 15,000short of the minimum required (allowing for the most stringent economies) to fulfil their commitments in 1944. The figure we have proposed is, in their view, likely to involve a redistribution of the planned Fleet, which mightnecessitate a drastic reconsideration of strategic plans.Army. There would be no reduction in the number of active formationsnecessary to carry out operations now planned or contemplated in 1944 in all theatres, and in 1945 in Japan. It should be noted, however, that five to sixlower establishment divisions will be roiled up and the men used to providereinforcements during the first nine months of 1944, and will not be reconstituted.The number of formations (after providing for the Japanese commitment in1945) available for garrisoning Europe in 1945 will be slightly below the present estimated liability.R.A .F. No reduction in planned squadron strength in 1944. Aircrewintakes must be reduced from the spring of 1944, but this would not involvea decline from the current programme until the autumn of 1945. Our effective-ness against the Japanese would not be reduced. If, without any regard to risks,we could act on the assumption that the war with Germany will be over by theend of 1944, then, instead of the suggested intake of 50,000 men and 10,000women, a net release of 22,500 men and 23,000 women could be effected in 1944by a drastic reduction of the training organisation. We do not feel able torecommend this because it involves such serious consequences if the basicassumption is falsified. If the war with Germany continued in 1945, the resultof those releases would be a decline of some 25 per cent, in combat squadronsby the end of 1945. It would be impossible to restore the position in any reasonable time. In an endeavour to frame our allocations on a reasonablebasis, and having regard to points made in discussion at the Conference ofMinisters on the 5th November, we chose a middle course of allocating 25,000men in each half year, which has the effect of postponing any appreciablereduction in the existing programme until the autumn of 1945. The AirMinistry represent that in this way, for a relatively small premium in man-power in 1944, a very substantial insurance against unfavourable developments in the war with. Germany would be obtained. If. however, this is considered in the circumstances too great an insurance, the Navy intake could be increased at the expense of the R.A.F.Civil Defence.11. While we have not been able to discuss the question with the Ministryof Home Security, we think it is necessary, if the budget is to be balanced, that civil Defence should make a contribution. We therefore suggest a further cut in full-time Civil Defence personnel of 50,000, on the strength at the end of 1943of 294,000. Presumably any cut decided upon would have to be operated so asto maintain the defences of London and the South-East.

Admiralty. The reduced allocation of labour will not result in any appreciable reduction in ship construction in 1944, will involve no sacrifice ofships in service in that year, and will be achieved mainly, if not entirely, by reductions in equipment or consumable stores.Ministry of Supply. Of the 120,000 decrease proposed for the first half-year,between 30,000 and 40,000 is the direct result of cuts already planned in 1943,the full effect of which has not yet been felt. It should be noted that only about two-thirds of the Ministry of Supply labour force is engaged on War Office work,and nearly all this reduction would fall on that two-thirds. There is a reasonable chance that the balance could be so arranged that essential supplies to the Armyate not prejudiced, but this statement assumes that the existing expectations ofsupplies from United States, the Dominions and India are realised.Ministry of Aircraft Production. The proposals should mean a small increase in average strength in the first half of 1944, as compared with what might have been expected on the reduced allocation of 115,000 decided by theCabinet in last July. The Ministry of Aircraft Production point out that theyhave always maintained that to secure peak production an increase of 212.000by the 1st January. 1944, would bo necessary. They, however, express the viewthat the allocation now proposed should not involve any reduction of essentialaircraft until the last two months of 1944 if two conditions are fulfilled firstly,that they can -retain their .skilled labour, and secondly, that 65,000 workpeoplecan be found from firms now engaged on the production of types which the AirMinistry will agree can be discontinued or reduced. Reference is made in theAppendix to the further effect if the war with Germany continued in 1945.[26483] i) 2

Departments other than the Service Departments are directly concernedwith these Groups and the Committee is not therefore a suitable body to submitproposed allocations within this field. Since, however, our main task has been to suggest what allocations should be made to Service Departments and munitions industries so as to make possible maximum effort in 1944 within the total limits of the man-power available, and since the essential industries bear directly onthe munitions industries and some of the less essential (e.g., textiles) are concernedwith the fulfilment of Service requirements, it has been necessary to show a globalallocation for these two groups of industries. After taking account of theestimated decline in the total available, these allocations balance in each half-year.The detailed allocations might be settled under the supervision of the ministerial committee on Man-Power as soon as the broad decisions are taken by the Cabinet.In view of the importance of ensuring that the allocations to the service departments and certain essential services (including the merchant navy, coal-mining and transport) are fulfilled, particularly in the first half of the year, we feel it would-be unwise to budget for a deficit.Within Group II the allocations for coal-mining and the merchant navy should be regarded, as on a par with those for the Services, as the men will besupplied by the machinery of call-up under the National Service Acts. In orderto achieve net increases of 17,000 and 10,000 respectively, coal-mining and themerchant navy will require directed intakes of 30,000 and 15,000It will be obvious that, like all other claimants, the other industries and services in the Group (e.g., National Government Service and Agriculture) cannotreceive under this assumption the full allocations for which they originally asked.The supply of man-power falls far short of the demand, and some sacrifice is inevitable if we are to make the maximum effort in 1944.
16. The consolidated Balance Sheet produced by these allocations can besummarised as follows : Table IV.(Men and Women together.)(Thousands.)Estimatedend-1943Strength.(a)OriginalDemandsfor 1944.(b)Proposed Allocations.First half.Estimatedend-1944Second half, j   Strength.(d) ye)ForcesCivil DefenceMunitions Industries (a) Supply Departments(b) Others ......Group II IndustriesGroup III IndustriesDecline in Industrial Popu-lationExcess   of   demands  oversupplies4,8952944,2431,1415,6506,216776168*6240/ -f 56\ - 1061501,29020350- 190J + 5 \1-15    /72+    15- 1157571146381048754,7812443,9071,1315,7606,078* Demands based on original end-1943 target strengths.Means whereby it is suggested that the allocations should be fulfilled.17. (a) On the assumption of maximum effort in 1944, allocations to theServices, the merchant navy, coal-mining and transport should be regarded as a first charge. Since these allocations are largely concentrated into the first half ofthe year and the 18-year olds (who are a main source of supply) come in an evenflow over the twelve months it will be necessary, in order to meet the needs of thefirst six months, to draw to the limit, during that period, upon all other men who can be released from industry. For the second six months we shall be left with little else than the second half of the 18-year olds. Since, on the basic assumption,there are bound to be considerable decreases in the products of the Metals and chemical Groups, these industries must face some appreciable reduction in theearly part of 1944. The programmes of the Supply Departments are not likelyto be cut in such a way as to throw up for release many men of military age. Butthe need to get every man who can be made available must involve the cessation of blanket deferments.(b) To provide the intake required for the Women&apos;s Services, we suggest thatvoluntary recruitment should be opened for girls between 17^ and 19. It isestimated that this would provide most, if not all, of the numbers allocated, and since girls are not conscripted until 19 years of age, and the normal recruitment for the Services is largely comprised of mobile women, this proposal should be ofsome assistance in mitigating the shortage of &quot; mobiles &quot; for industry. Further-more, a certain number of the girls who would be recruited in this way are not already engaged in industry, and to this extent a slight alleviation of the overallshortage would be secured. &apos; Moreover, some of them will have completed their training in pre-service units and it is desirable that entry into the Services shouldnot be prohibited for these.   We have made no statistical allowance for this.to As regards the cuts and transfers within the industrial groups (i) large-scale transfers of labour are inevitably uneconomical since a proportion of the non-directables are lost to industry;(ii) experience has shown that even with due notice of cuts and with everyeffort to arrange switches of capacity and to apply the balance ofthe cuts in areas where the labour shortage is most acute temporarypockets of unemployment are difficult to avoid ;(iii) it will be increasingly difficult to locate additional cuts in the difficultlabour areas;(iv) included in the programmes of the Supply and other Departmentsthere is certain work which is vital to maximum impact on theenemy and is of operational urgency.
18.   In regard to (c) above, we recommend :  (i) That, although the overriding preference for the whole of the air-craft programme will cease at the end of 1943, machinery is necessaryso that products and Services which are vital to the maximum effort in 1944 (whether in aircraft or other programmes) may be assured the labour supply they need within the approved allocations. Thequestion of continuance and extension of the system of Designationshould be considered by the Departments concerned.(ii) That as long notice as possible (a month should be the minimum)should be given to the Ministry of Labour and the firms concerned as to decision to effect cuts.(iii) That Departments who, under the proposed allocations, have to sustaindecreases should not plan cuts up to the full amount. Some partmight be provided by controlled wastage. Controlled wastagesimply means a planning not to replace wastage beyond a certainpoint, relying in so doing upon increased efficiency. Such planningwill help the Ministry of Labour and will reduce the number of caseswhere drastic cuts have to be made with consequent loss of some ofthe &quot; non-directables.&apos;&apos;(iv) That subject to (iii) the plan for the first half should be regarded asfirm and that for the second half as provisional and subject to review1at the-beginning of May 1944.(Signed on behalf of the Committee),R. J. SINCLAIR.17th November, 1943.APPENDIX.An indication of what our situation would, be in 1945 if the proposals in theReport were carried out but the war with Germany continued during 1945.1. For the purpose of this &quot; indication &quot; we assume that the war withGermany continues throughout 1945.2. Whatever plans are made, the total man-power available in 1945 will beeven less than in 1944. And it is likely that the whole burden of this declinewould have to be borne by the Services and the munitions industries.3. As regards the strength of the Services the position would be asfollows :  (a) The Navy would be in almost as good a position to wage war againstGermany in 1945 as in 1944, but further deployment against japan would be delayed.(b) The Army would by June 1945 have a Field Force less by some 4 Divisionsthan it will have by the end of 1944. A further decline in the second half of 1945 is unavoidable. More United States Army troops wouldbe the only way of offsetting this decrease in striking force.(c) The position of the R.A.F. is explained in paragraph 10 of the Report.4.   The Supply position would be as follows : (a) The allocation proposed for the Admiralty for 1944 does not affect theirshipbuilding or equipment programme to such an extent as to place them at a disadvantage if the war with Germany continued in 1945.The limiting factor on their activities will be manning rather thanships.(&amp;) Army reserves of material at the end of 1944 would be barely adequate for a Force then starting to decline. Although the total productivecapacity of the Ministry of Supply would be only slightly less thanthat required, nevertheless, considerable readjustments would have tobe made to continue the war against Germany, and these would present difficulties. There would be some shortage which would have to bemet from the United States and might involve the use of Americantypes.
(c) By the end of 1944 the Ministry of Aircraft Production labour force would be less by some 117,000 or 6 per cent, than was estimated to berequired for the peak of the current programme. In the opinion ofthe Ministry of Aircraft Production the effect of working at thisreduced strength throughout 1945 would be an appreciable reductionin aircraft produced. Pending, however, further examination of proposals now under consideration for modifications of the programme without sacrifice of operational efficiency, a quantitative estimate ofthis is not possible. The rate of output in the first half of 1945 should in any event be above the present level.5. There has been no time for full consultation between the Services andtheir Supply Departments on details of particular stores. We have, however,done our best, in the limited time available, to show the broad picture.
