naval SITUATION.General Review.1. A convoy has reached North Russia escorted and covered by ships of theHome Fleet.Four Japanese destroyers have been sunk by U.S. warships in the S.W.Pacific.A heavy concentration of U-boats on a convoy in the S.W. Approaches wasprevented from making any effective attack. One U-boat was sunk, one probably sunk and one possibly damaged by the escorts.Shipping losses have been light.Northern Waters.2. A strongly escorted convoy of 19 ships, which was covered by ships ofthe Home Fleet, including a U.S. cruiser and destroyers, has arrived in NorthernRussian ports without incident.Home Waters and North Atlantic.3. H.M.S. Chanticleer (sloop), while escorting a homebound convoy, was torpedoed and seriously damaged north-east of the Azores on the 18th. She has since reached port in tow. The casualties include two officers and 26 ratingsdead or missing.H.M.S. Winchelsea (destroyer), shortly after leaving the same convoy on the21st, was attacked by an He. 177 with two glider-bombs in the South-western approaches, but shot down the bombs and suffered only slight damage.Mediterranean.4. * Allied coastal craft sank a lighter laden with petrol on the night of the21st/22nd, south of Leghorn.HAL S/M Unseen on the 12th torpedoed a medium-sized tanker off Toulon.H.1VL S/M Universal, on the 22nd. also off Toulon, sank a large landing craftcarrying motor transport.H.M.S. Cadmus (minesweeper) was damaged by a near miss during an air attack on the 20th off Naples.5. In the Adriatic, H.M. destroyers Quilliam and Loyal sank one or twoF-lighters and damaged a tug in a small convoy north-west of Pescara on the night of the 19th/20th. The destroyers sustained superficial damage from the fire of coastal batteries and had one officer killed.H.M.S. Hebe (minesweeper) was mined and sunk on the 22nd off Bari; the casulties include 38 killed.An Italian motor A/S boat, which was on passage to Split in company witha German escort, sank the escorting vessel by depth charges and escaped toTermoli.Two schooners which were operating in the Adriatic manned by british naval personnel have been missing since the 10th.Levant.6. H.M.S. Phaibe (cruiser), in company with the French destroyersLe Fantasgue and Le Terrible, when ineffectively attacked on the 19th by 27Ju. 88s south-east of Crete, shot down two and possibly shot down two others.The Polish S/M Sokol during a recent patrol sank an A/S schooner and asmall caique in the southern iEgean and two schooners and an E-boat off SitiaBay, Crete.H.M. S/M Simoom is overdue from patrol and must be considered lost.7. Over 200 Allied personnel are known to have been evacuated from Lerosin small craft; the majority were landed on Turkish soil. In addition,177 German prisoners were taken off the island.From Samos, coastal craft have completed the evacuation without loss.The total included 222 British (84 from Nikaria), 758 Greeks and 1,778 Italians.8. Between the 18th September and the 24th November, the following losses were inflicted on the enemy during operations in the aegean : nine cargo ships(totalling 18,000 tons), ten landing craft or lighters, seven torpedo-boats or escort vessels, five armed caiques and a small minelayer.
Casualties to H.M. ships operating in the iEgean during the same periodwere four cruisers damaged, five destroyers sunk, three destroyers damaged,a submarine and eight coastal craft sunk or missing. Two Greek destroyers anda Greek submarine were lost in addition.South-West Pacific.9. Six Japanese destroyers were engaged between New Britain andBougainville by U.S. forces, which sank four of the destroyers and damaged a fifth.   The U.S. ships sustained no damage.U.S. M.T.Bs, on the night of the 22nd/23rcl, intercepted a convoy of bargescarrying troops and supplies in the Vitiaz Strait (between New Britain and new guinea).   Three barges were sunk, four probably sunk and one damaged.Eight Japanese ships, escorted by a light cruiser and a destroyer, were seen to have arrived at Hansa Bay (New Guinea).Anti-Submarine Operations.10. TAventy-two attacks on TJ-boats have been reported; eight by shore-based aircraft, 13 by warships and one by a cargo ship. Three of the attacks were carried out in the Indian Ocean.The escorts of a homeward-bound convoy Avere engaged over a period ofthree days with a concentration of 25 to 30 U-boats in the South-western approaches. A large number of aircraft from various bases co-operated withthe escorts, which had been specially reinforced, and no U-boat succeeded inpenetrating the outer screen. One U-boat was sunk by H.M.S. Nene (frigate)and H.M. Canadian corvettes Snowberry and Calgary; one was probably sunk by ELM. ships Crane (sloop) and Foley (frigate) and one was possibly damaged by it.M.S. Essington (frigate).Enemy Intelligence.11. The nurnberg, which is believed to be at present employed on trainingduties, passed northwards through the Sound on the 19th, probably bound for aDanish port or Oslo.A floating dock has arriAred at Salonika.German Navy Lists show that the number of executive, engineer andgunnery officers increased from 3,658 in June 1940 to 8,036 in October 1942.Admiral Abe, the head of the Japanese mission in Europe, is to tour theGerman naval bases in Norway&quot;.U-boats.12. There are indications of a small concentration about 600 miles west of Ireland (R).  One or two U-boats are off the Guiana coast and northern Brazil.Three Japanese U-boats are believed to be operating off Kilindini, Aden and ceylon respectively.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. U-boats are reported to have attacked three ships, of Avhich two are known to have sunk. One ship was torpedoed in the Caribbean off Colon; one was sunk in the Mediterranean, off Cotrone, and one was sunk by a JapaneseU-boat south-east of Aden.Air attacks on a homeward-bound convoy in the South-Western Approachescaused damage by glider-bombs to two ships, one of which Avas abandoned.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending the 20th, 863 ships were convoyed. Of these,310 ships were in ocean convoys and 553 in British coastal convoys. One escortcarrier, 61 destroyers and 115 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including12 U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.Five ocean convoys, consisting of 157 ships, arrived in Home waters without loss.Allied Minelaying.15. Mines were laid by surface craft off the Dutch coast and in the Channel.Aircraft laid mines off the Frisian Islands, off the Dutch coast, in the channel and off the Biscay ports.Minelaying by aircraft was also carried out in the Eastern mediterranean and by U.S. aircraft off Hong Kong.&apos; [26472] b
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. There have been no reports of minelaying either by ships or aircraft during the week.Four mines were destroyed in Home Waters.The mine totals are 4,587 ground and 3,897 moored.17. In the Mediterranean, 14 mines were destroyed on one day oft&apos; Bari,where the port was temporarily closed. Up to the 20th, one minesweeping flotillahad destroyed 158 mines in the Gulf of Gaeta. Another flotilla, between the9th and the 13th, destroyed 121 mines off Salerno.Enemy Merchant Shipping.18. The Italian liners Duilio (23,636 tons) and. Giulio Cesar e (21.900 tons),which were scuttled at Trieste at the time of the Italian Armistice, are reportedto have been raised by the Germans. The Italian s.s. Pier Luigi (2,571 tons) isreported to have caught tire and sunk at Suda Bay on the 13th when heavilyladen with ammunition.19. During October, 58 enemy merchant ships totalling 137,488 tons were sunk, captured or destroyed and five ships totalling 22,091 tons were seriously damaged. Fifty-four of the ships were&apos; destroyed or captured in the Mediter-ranean. Enemy shipping casualties from the beginning of the war up till theend of October 1943. were estimated to be 1,880 ships totalling 6,270,058 tonssunk, captured or destroyed and 424 ships totalling 1,342,663 tons seriously damaged.Spanish Intelligence.20. The projected exercises of the Spanish fleet north of Finisterre havebeen considerably modified in response to British representations.The six Italian ships, totalling 32,000 tons and including two tankers, whichare at present interned in ports on the Spanish mainland are to be released.No decision has yet been reached on the ships in Spanish ports overseas.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map is included as an inset.)Leningrad Sector.21. The Germans have reported Russian attacks south of Lake Ladoga onthe 20th, but the Russians have not mentioned any fighting in this area.Nevel-Vitebsk Sector.22. For some days the Germans continued to report Russian attackssouth-west of Nevel and west of Smolensk, but since the 1.7th conditions in this sector have been comparatively quiet.Gomel Sector.23. The Russian thrust north-westwards from the Loev area has madesteady progress. Rechitsa was captured on the 18th and since then the russians have continued to advance both northwards and also along the railway towardsMosyr. The front of attack has now been extended southwards to link up witha Russian advance north-westwards on both sides of the river Pripet.The continued Russian progress in this sector threatens Gomel withencirclement, particularly as the Russians hold a bridgehead over the river Sojnorth of the town.Kiev Sector.24. North-west of Kiev the Russians have continued their advance.Korosten was captured on the 18th and Ovruch on the following day, and theRussian forces in this area are now very close to the southern edge of the Pripetmarshes. Further south, however, strong German counter-attacks forced theRussians on the 19th to evacuate Zhitomir, which they had taken on the 13th.Since then the Germans have continued to make fairly slow headway against thesouthern flank of the Russian salient, and fighting is now taking place some35 miles east of Zhitomir.
Dnieper Bend.25. On the 19th Russian troops crossed the Dnieper in the Cherkasi area and reached the outskirts of the town. Their bridgehead was enlarged thefollowing day. The Russians have also made some progress south-west and southof Kremenchug, but they have not made any further advance towards Krivoi Rog.They have gained a little more ground south-west of Dnepropetrovsk and on the17th they captured a town 22 miles west of Zaporozhe. South of Nikopol theGermans still hold a bridegheacl across the Dnieper.General.26. Both north and south of the Pripet marshes and also in the Dnieperbend the Russians have made further useful progress, but the German advancewest and south-west of Kiev represents the first Russian reverse for overfour months.   The Gei are being made in considerable strength andundoubtedly threaten the Russian forces in the Kiev salient, but there has so far been no break through, and the Russians have not lost any ground that is vital totheir positions.Italy.(An outline map is included as an inset.)27. Continued heavy rain during the past week has- restricted operationsalong the whole front in Italy. Many rivers are in flood (the Trigno rose sevenfeet in three days) and the roads, which (east of the Apennines) are second class and muddy, are in places well nigh impassable to wheeled vehicles.On the Eighth Army front the Germans appear to have abandoned all their positions south of the Sangro. Reports of requisitioning of donkeys and of theuse of much pack transport indicate that they are anticipating extensivemountain warfare. British and Imperial troops have made progress on bothflanks. By the 24th, 78th Division had formed a bridgehead over the RiverSangro stretching from the coast six miles inland and had constructed threebridges, and Indian troops had also forced a crossing north-west of Atessa,Further inland the Canadians have advanced five miles and encountered stiffopposition in the mountains immediately north of Castel di Sangro, and on the left flank British patrols are now a few miles beyond Alfedena.On the Fifth Army front there has been no material change and activity hasbeen limited to artillery exchanges and patrolling. German resistance has show no signs of weakening and north of the river Garigliano they are laying mine-fields and constructing defences.Certain Italian units are now reported to be under General Clark&apos;s commandbut there are so far no indications of their active participation.iEgean Operations.Leros.28.   Organised resistance on Leros ceased on the night of the 16th/17th.The British garrison on Leros had been reinforced by some 500 troops fromSamos between the 14th and 16th and totalled approximately 4,000 all ranks atthe time of the capitulation.The Germans reported that they captured 200 British officers and 3,000 other ranks. If these figures can be taken as correct, it means that some 500 personnel are unaccounted for, presumably killed or missing, after deducting some 230 whohave so far been evacuated from the island.Samos.29. As a result of the enemy switching his bomber effort on to Port Vathyand Tigani in Samos on the l7ith the latter port was put out of action and communications were badly disrupted.The Germans landed on Samos on the 22nd, and are now in occupation ofthe island. All British, Greek and a proportion of the Italian garrison had previously been evacuated without loss. (For numbers see under &quot;naval situation.&quot;)Yugoslavia.30.   The battle in Slovenia, has continued and Partisans are reported to bebeleaguering the German garrison in Novo Masto.   In the northern Adriatic the[26472] b 2
German landings on the islands of Veglia, Lussin and Cherso on the 13th appearto have been successful and these islands are now under German control, althoughPartisan resistance continues.In Bosnia the battle for Tuzla continues and the town appears to have changed hands several times.Greece.31. The civil war between E.L.A.S. and E.D.E.S. appears to have died downexcept in south Epirus where the local E.L.A.S. under Ares have again attackedE.D.E.S. Guerrillas of both parties have been reported in action against theGermans.Burma.32. The Japanese have made several unsuccessful attempts to dislodge our troops from positions five miles north-east of Maungdaw in the Arakan.On the 19th the Japanese attacked positions held by Levies 14 miles north-west of Falam in the Chin Hills. The Levies withdrew to the north-west and their positions were later occupied by the enemy. In the area of Fort Whitea successful raid was carried out on the 20th by a company of Indian troopsagainst Japanese positions. The enemy was taken by surprise and suffered 30to 35 casualties.   Our troops later withdrew having suffered 22 casualties.On the 16th approximately 300 Japanese crossed the Salween river intoYunnan some 30 miles south of the Burma Road.New Guinea.33. Since the 16th the Australian forces have made advances towards thehigh ground at Sattelberg about six miles inland from Finschhafen, and theyare now reported to be within half a mile of Sattelberg itself.Solomons.34. In Bougainville the Allied beachhead is now 9,000 yards wide by7.000 yards deep.   Enemy casualties reported to the 20th were 832 killed.Gilbert Islands.(An outline map is included as an inset.)35. Operations designed to seize Makin, Tarawa and Abemama islands inthe Gilbert group began on the 19th. Landings took place in the early hoursof the 21st on the western end of Butarutaru (the south-western island ofMakin Atoll) against light opposition, and on the northern end of the island in face of heavy machine-gun fire which was reduced by tanks. These units have joined hands and now control the western end of the island, which contains all important- installations. Press reports state that only mopping up remains tobe carried out on Makin. Marines landed on Tarawa Atoll at 0930 hours onthe 21st, and. encountered strong enemy resistance. There are no details available of the landings on Abemama.Press reports from Admiral Nimitz&apos;s Headquarters state that the landingsat Makin were carried out by the 27th United States Infantry Regiment, andat Tarawa by the 2nd United States Marine Division.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. Aircraft of Bomber Command made three heavy night attacks on berlin, one on Mannheim/Ludwigshafen and one on Leverkusen. US. bombersmade daylight attacks on targets in France, Germany and Norway.In the Mediterranean, bad weather conditions restricted operations. enemy communications were attacked in Italy, Yugoslavia and Albania.In the Pacific, heavy attacks were made on enemy targets in Bougainvilleand New Britain and on shipping.
United Kingdom.37, In daylight, two enemy reconnaissance aircraft were reported over theShetland Islands. At night, three scattered raids were made over the southerncounties by a total of 19 enemy aircraft, five of which reached the Greater london area.   One Me. 410 and one FW. 190 were shot down by Mosquitoes.Home Waters.38. Beaufighters attacked a convoy off Texel and another off the norwegian coast; a 8,000-ton ship was left sinking and a 1,500-ton ship and seven escort vessels were damaged. Hurricanes sank a trawler off Gravelines, and Typhoonsdamaged four minesweepers off Brittany. Two enemy aircraft were shot downand four Beaufighters are missing.Fifty-five aircraft of Bomber Command laid 151 sea-mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.39. One hundred and twenty-nine Fortresses (B. 17) bombed unidentifiedtargets in Western Germany; 245 tons were dropped, but results were notobserved.Air-frame and aero-engine repair factories at Kjeller (Oslo) were attacked by 87 Liberators (B. 24), which dropped 233 tons of bombs with good results(see Appendix VII).Marauders (B. 26) and Typhoons dropped 127 tons on four airfields inNorthern France, many bursts being seen on all the targets.Four attacks were made on Military Objectives near Gris Nez by Mitchells(B. 25), Bostons (A. 20) and Typhoons, 151 tons being dropped with good results.Mosquitoes obtained hits on two power stations in Brittany, Spitfires damaged atrain and three locomotives in Northern France and Typhoons attacked gun positions near Fecamp.In all these operations, Allied fighters (which flew 1,653 sorties during theweek) and bombers destroyed nine enemy aircraft, probably destroyed eight and damaged 16 for the loss of nine Liberators (B. 24), two Marauders (B. 26) and four fighter-bombers and fighters.Night.40.

In the firstattack, the markers, although punctually dropped, were widely scattered, and noconcentration of bombing wras achieved. A number of fires was started, the glowof which was reflected on the clouds. In the other two attacks, the markers wereaccurately placed and well maintained throughout, but owing to weather conditions results were difficult to assess. Early arrivals in the third attackreported fires still burning from the previous night, and a Mosquito, which flew over Berlin two hours after the attack, reported nine large fires forming a circleabout eight miles in diameter, also two additional fires to the south-west of themain concentration.   See Appendix VII.At Mannheim/Ludwigshafen, visibility was moderately good. The markerbombs achieved a. fair concentration. Many crews identified the Rhine and thegeneral opinion is that the greater part of the attack fell on the Mannheim area.
Over Leverkusen, thick cloud was encountered. The marker bombs appearedto be widely scattered and the majority of the aircraft bombed the estimatedposition of the target.A total of 54 Mosquitoes, one of which is missing, made small-scale attacks on Berlin and towns in North-West Germany.Intruder aircraft flew 69 sorties over Northern France, the Low countries and Western Germany; one aircraft is missing. Leaflets were dropped on french, Belgian and Dutch towns by a total of 56 aircraft.Italy.41. Railway centres at Foligno (73 miles N.N.E. of Rome) and Grossetowere bombed by 77 and 24 Marauders (B. 26) respectively, and the targets were well covered, causing heavy destruction of rail-road property. At Fano (30 miles .W. of Ancona) the railway bridge was hit and seriously damaged; the bridgeat Cassino was believed to have been destroyed, and attacks were made on bridgesat Cecina (160 miles N.W. of Rome) and Pontecorvo (18 miles N.N.E. of Gaeta).Civitavecchia was bombed by Marauders (B. 26) and Invaders (A. 36); severe damage extending over 18 acres was caused in the harbour area, the east quaywas hit seven times and rendered unserviceable, a vessel was sunk and manybursts were observed in the railway yards. The only night raid carried out by wellingtons Avas on Ciampino airfield (S.E. of Rome) and on the adjoining-railway junction; one hangar was hit. buildings were damaged and bombs burstamongst 30 aircraft.In the eastern battle area close support for the army Avas provided by light and fighter-bombers; enemy strong points and gun positions in the Lancianoarea (20 miles S.S.E. of Pescara) were heavily attacked, one raid being carriedout by over 70 Marauders (B. 26). Harassing attacks by day and by night weremade on M.T., trains and roads as far north as Ancona, and many M.T. vehicles and locomotives were destroyed or damaged.In the western battle area military targets were attacked at Viticuso,Vallerrotonda (30 miles N.E. of Gaeta) and Opi (26 miles N.N.E. of Frosinone).In the course of operations by the North African Air Force for the weekending the 23rd November, 25 enemy aircraft were destroyed and 21 allied aircraft are missing.Yugoslavia and Albania.42. An attack was made on Sibenik (32 miles N.W. of Split) by 24 Mitchells(B. 25) and hits Avere observed on the docks and on the harbour railway.Warhavvks (P. 40F) carried out attacks on M.T. and railway targets in the areasof Split. Knin (40 miles N.N.W. of Split) and Metkovic (22 miles S.S.W. ofMostar); 29 vehicles and t\vo locomotives were destroyed or damaged. an aircraft Avas destroyed on the ground at Sinj airfield (15 miles N.W. of Split)and Spitfires obtained hits on the main road junction at Bihac (95 miles N.N.W.of Split). In the course of an Air Sea Rescue operation three Me. 109s were destroyed and two Spitfires and one Walrus were shot down; the survivor froma Mitchell (B. 25) and the crew of the Walrus were rescued.In Albania Spitfires carried out offensive sweeps along the Durazzo-Tiranaroad and other roads leading to Fier (45 miles S.S.W. of Tirana) and Berat;42 vehicles Avere destroyed or damaged and two camouflaged cisterns explodedafter being machine-gunned: one Spitfire is missing.Greece and Crete.43. On the 17th and 18th airfields in Greece Avere bombed. Athens/Eleusiswas twice attacked by a total of 91 Fortresses (B. 17) and many bursts were seen on hangars and buildings and 30 grounded aircraft were destroyed or damaged.Athens/Kalamaki wvas bombed by Mitchells (B. 25) Avith good results. Anotherformation of Mitchells (B. 25) attacked Larissa airfield and destroyed two aircraft on the ground and left eight fires burning.Twelve heavy-bombers attacked Heraklion (Crete) and Khalkis (Greece) and dropped sea-mines in the harbours. A night raid was made on Heraklion (Crete)airfield; cloud partly obscured the target but bursts were seen in the landing area.
Leros and Samos.44. Further information has now become available which supersedes the relevant paragraphs of last week&apos;s Resume (220).In support of the assault on Leros the G.A.F. employed a striking force,estimated at up to 100 Ju. 88 long-range bombers and 50/60 Ju. 87 dive-bomberswith some 25 single-engined fighters and a small force of twin-engined fighters and coastal aircraft acting as escort and cover for the various stages of theoperation.The enemy long-range and dive-bomber effort against the Island wassustained and comparatively heavy, having regard to the forces available inthe area.The number of sorties increased appreciably on the day of the assault andwas sustained at an average of some 135 sorties per 24 hours, roughly half beingJu. 88 long-range bombers, the other half Ju. 87 dive-bombers. G.A.F. activity was confined almost exclusively to daylight hours. The offensive effort was directed above all against artillery and A.A. positions on the Island, and it isestimated that about 575 tons of high explosive bombs were dropped, and at oneperiod small anti-personnel bomb containers were also employed. Single-enginedfighter sorties on sea and air transport escorts and other activities directly or indirectly connected with the operation were at an average rate of 26 sortiesper day.About 1,100 parachutists were dropped in tw7o relays, about 900 on the 12thand the remainder on the following day.The Allied bombing of enemy airfields on the Greek mainland did not causeenough damage to affect appreciably the G.A.F. scale of effort. Night bombing of airfields on Rhodes and Kos failed to render these landing groundspermanently unserviceable and Allied intervention was handicapped by theremoteness of bases. It is clear that local enemy air superiority was of paramount importance.After the fall of Leros enemy bombers attacked Samos. When it became evident, however, that the Allies did not intend to attempt to hold Samos. air attacks ceased and G.A.F. operations in the whole Eastern Mediterranean areasank to a low level.Russia.45. Unfavourable weather conditions resulted in a decrease of air activity on all sectors of the front. Nevertheless the Russian Air Force continued tosupport Russian land forces, especially in the area of Fastov and Zhitomir at thebeginning of the week when damage was inflicted on enemy troop concentrations,tanks and M.T., and also on the 19th in the capture of the railway centre ofOvruch.Due to constant bad weather, G.A.F. support for the important battles being-waged in the Zhitomir area and in the Dnieper Bend was on a low scale and on some days only reconnaissance activity was possible. In the Crimea, a smallG.A.F. close-support force of fighters&apos; and ground-attack aircraft is operating against the Russian bridgeheads near Kerch, but the Russians continue to possessair superiority in this area.Burma and Siam.46. enemy communications and shipping were again the principal targets.The railway yards at Sagaing, Namkwin (Upper Burma) and Pyinmana (LowerBurma) were seriously damaged.In the Arakan 35 river craft were destroyed, and on the Irrawaddy and otherrivers three steamers and many small craft were damaged.Attacks were also made oii the airfields at Heho, Namsang (East Burma) andChiengmai (Siam), where eight aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and on enemy barracks, camps and supply dumps.China.47. Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping at Kowloon, Swatowand off the coast; a 3,000-ton ship and two smaller ships were sunk and a gun-boat and five ships were damaged. Attacks were also made on river craft, many ofwhich were destroyed or damaged, and on wharves, warehouses and troops.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.55. On the first two nights of the week minor bombing occurred at Sevenoaks(18th/19th) and at Leatherhead (19th/20th). On the following night a fewbombs were .dropped in Greater London. At Battersea these caused a numberof casualties and damage to private property; property was also damaged atHorsham.Casualties..56. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ended 0600 hours on the24th were 9 fatal and 51 serious; of these, 8 fatal and 42 serious occurred atBattersea.Pacific.Bougainville.48. Heavy attacks were made on enemy airfields at Kara, Buka, Bonds andKahili and on supply lines and concentrations. A ship and four barges were sunk and a small ship was damaged off the coast.Enemy aircraft were more active than usual, especially in the EmpressAugusta Bay area, where Allied fighters destroyed 35 for the loss of two.New Guinea.49. Enemy concentrations and supply and barge bases in the Finschhafenand Sattelberg areas, and traffic on the Bogadyim road and on the coastal tracknear Sio were bombed and machine-gunned with good effect. An enemy ship was sunk in Manokwari harbour (Dutch New Guinea) and two small ships and sevenbarges were sunk in Hansa Bay.New Britain.50 Liberators (B. 24) dropped 380 tons of bombs on enemy positions inRing Ring plantation, near Gasmata, and Mitchells (B. 25) and Liberators (B. 24)dropped 142 tons on dumps and installations in the Gasmata area. Airfields atCape Gloucester and Lakunia were also bombed.Off the coast, a 10,000-ton ship was set on fire and several barges and other small craft were sunk or damaged.New Ireland.51. Liberators (B. 24) attacked shipping off the coast; a ship was leftsinking, another was set on fire and three barges were sunk.Amboiria and Celebes.52. Mitchells (B. 25) and Beaufighters sank a cargo ship and an escort vessel off the Tanimbar Islands, and also sank a 3,000-ton ship and damaged two others off the Aru Islands.  A 8,000-ton ship was sunk off Celebes.Java.53. Liberators (B. 24) dropped 20 tons of bombs on Tjepoc oil refineries(70 miles W. of Sourabaya) with unobserved results.Gilbert Islands.54. Liberators (B. 24) dropped 21 tons of bombs on Tarawa Island and23 tons on Makin Island.

APPENDIX VII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Berlin. The little evidence so far available from Intelligence sourcesconfirms the impression given in recent press reports that a major disaster hasoccurred.Diisselclorf. A study of the photographs for rail activity taken after the attack on the 3rd/4th November shows that extensive damage to railway facilitieswas caused. In the main station, two partly burnt out trains were standing atplatforms with their engines still on fire and burnt-out vehicles, south of thestation, obstructed two tracks. Altogether, at least half the tracks through thestation were cut or obstructed. The line south-east to Cologne is considered tohave been completely closed and tracks on the main line to Wuppertal cut.Working through Diisselclorf southwards and between Wuppertal and routes westthrough Neuss must have been seriously affected.Norway.Oslo. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the18th November after the daylight attack by the U.S.A.A.F. shows that both theDaimler Benz and the Bayerische Motoren Werke aero-engine factories have been severely damaged. The Brinker airframe repair factory also suffered heavy damage.Rjukan. Photographs taken on the 17th and 18th November after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 16th November are of poor quality, and in consequenceassessment of damage is rendered difficult. If can be. seen, however, that theVemork Power Station is fairly heavily damaged at the west end and that theElectrolysis Plant, the largest in the world, is damaged more severely.The Electro-Chemical Works have received considerable damage in thecentral and eastern parts and many of the buildings have suffered. transport facilities have been affected by the damage in the eastern part.France.Cannes. In the attack on the llth/12th November, the Acieries du Nordlocomotive repair works at La Bocca was so damaged it is considered repair workmay not be undertaken. On the same night the W/T submarine control station at Agay was destroyed.
