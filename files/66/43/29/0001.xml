(43) 529.22nd November, 1943.WAR CABINET.RELIEF ESTIMATES FOR FOOD AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS.Memorandum by the Minister of State.AS directed by the Prime Minister&apos;s Minute of the 15th October, 1943, annex a Memorandum showing the genesis, character, and method of handling of the relief estimates for food and other requirements which have been sent to washington.The memorandum is long and somewhat detailed, and I would like to putmore briefly the essential point which it brings out. It is this. These estimates have been sent to the Combined Food Board simply in order that we may obtainits views upon the possibility of meeting them. When the Minister of Food hasthe views of the Combined Food Board he will be in a position to bring the matter to the War Cabinet for a decision. In the meantime His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis in no way committed to the estimates.I do not think that any other kind of procedure would have been possible,or that the War Cabinet can come to a decision on this question without havingbefore them the facts which only the Combined Food Board can supply.R. K. L.Foreign Office, 22nd November, 1943.ANNEX.Memorandum.I General.1. At the St. James&apos;s Palace Conference in September 1941, it was agreedthat an Inter-Allied Committee, under the Chairmanship of a United kingdom representative, should prepare estimates of the relief requirements of allied countries. The Committee issued its first Report in June 1943, dealing in themain with import requirements after the whole of Europe was liberated, and making due allowance for Europe&apos;s own resources.2. Early in 1943 it became evident that the Combined Supply organisationsin Washington must be informed what was the order of magnitude of probablerelief requirements up to the end of 1944, in order that they could take accountof the possible impact of these requirements on the planning and allocation of world production.3.   For this purpose it was necessary to provide estimates in a form useful to the Combined Boards.   The estimates of the Inter-Allied Committee represent12204   [26454]
an expert and conscientious attempt to produce balanced statements of require-ments for Allied countries, based in general on a consumption level equal to orlower than the present level in the United Kingdom. They are thus of great value as data, but the following difficulties still had to be dealt with : (a) Requirements of enemy countries, with which the Inter-Allied committee did not deal, had to be estimated.(6) The Inter-Allied Committee was only in a position to deal with thesituation which will arise when the whole of Europe is liberated and isfree to trade. It could not forecast the course of operations, orformulate a timed programme of total requirements during the periodof progressive liberation, when only some countries are requiringrelief. Nor could it make assumptions about the extent to whichdamage would be done by the enemy in withdrawing.(c) It was not possible for the Allied delegates to be informed of the worldsupply position, or to take more than a generalised account of it. If,indeed, any serious attempt had been made by them to relate their various demands, with the assistance of British authorities, to theactual supply position, the effect would only have been to anticipate thework of the Combined Supply Authorities, and probably to prejudice the position by the production of&apos; estimates purporting to be not onlytheoretically reasonable, but also realisable in practice.4. The Relief Department of the Board of Trade, in conjunction with theWar Office, the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and with the other BritishDepartments concerned, and with the co-operation of American experts, preparedestimates on the following lines for the period June 1943 to December 1944 :  (a) For the &quot;military period&quot; of six months following invasion of each country, estimates were based on a low scale of consumption deemedsufficient to prevent disease and unrest. For the subsequent period in-&apos; each Allied country the estimates of the Inter-Allied committee referred to above were in general followed. To these were addedestimates for enemy countries and estimates of the effect on reliefrequirements of a &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy on the enemy&apos;s part.For the reasons already given no attempt was made at this stage totake account of the supply position.(6) The War Office applied the necessary assumptions as regards the progressof liberation and as regards damage done by the enemy, through a process by which the security of their plans was safeguarded.The estimates resulting from these operations are known as the. phasedYoung-Sinclair estimates. They represent a timed programme of bulk require-ments, fitting in with the assumptions applied by the War Office, but taking no specific account of supply possibilities.II. Food.5. In the case of food, the exceptional course was taken of working outrequirements on two alternative consumption bases, with a view to assisting the combined Food Board in an objective examination of the situation. These twoassumptions were (a) That the supply* provides the equivalent of 2,000 calories per head per day as an average for the urban population, the agricultural popula-tion being assumed to be better fed than&apos; this.t(b) That the supply is maintained for six months only at the above level, andis then raised for Allied countries to 2,650 calories per day as anaverage for the whole population, which is the level proposed by theInter-Allied Committee. (For enemy countries the rise is to 2,400calories.)6. The above estimates, together with estimates prepared by AmericanAgencies, are now being discussed with the United States Authorities in Wash-ington with reference to the question whether they are suitable for submission to* This is used in the sense of gross supply, equal to domestic production plus imports,without allowing for loss in distribution, &amp;c.f Allowance was made for the fall in import requirements which should follow fromprogressive improvement in certain countries in the control of the movement of indigenousfood-stuffs from agricultural to urban areas.
the Combined Food Board. The British representatives have been instructedthat the estimates prepared in London have not received the approval of respon-sible authorities in the United Kingdom, and the estimates have been accompaniedby comments and criticisms agreed between the British Departments concerned.The presentation of some such estimates is a necessary preliminary for an objective study by the Combined Food Board of the world supply position, with aview to stating the issues which will need decisions on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government.7. The phased estimates of requirements of the principal food-stuffs, onthe two bases referred to at (a) and (b) in paragraph 5 above, are set out in the annexed Table.   The figures are, of course, subject to a high degree of uncertainty.I understand that the Minister of Food will shortly be circulating a note on the world food supply position and that prospective supplies will, in general,be quite insufficient to meet the above estimates of relief requirements inaddition to the requirements of the non-axis world on the present scale of consumption.8. The experts of the Ministry of Food have advised that the lower basis(viz. (a)) should be sufficient to prevent disease and unrest for, say, six months,if no hard manual work is expected from the recipient population. The sames cale should be sufficient, in the opinion of the experts, to prevent disease for a considerably longer period. I must add, however, that there is no criterion to assess how long it would be sufficient to prevent unrest. It represents a level which the Inter-Allied Committee were prepared to accept only for the shortest possible period during which it may be physically impossible to provide a higher standard. Further, if provision is to be made for manual work, the Ministry ofFood experts advise that increased rations equivalent to 1,000 to 2,000 caloriesper head per day will be required for those engaged in such work; the expertshave agreed that this additional requirement could be met by adding breadgrain up to the equivalent of 250 calories per head per day as an average overthe non-agricultural population, depending on the amount of work expected.The higher level (viz. (b)) of 2,650 calories as an average over the whole population, followed in the estimates for the post-military phases, is regarded bythe Ministry of Food experts as a reasonable target at which to aim in order toprovide for a fairly high level of commercial and industrial activity. The actualconsumption level for the United Kingdom at the present time is slightly over2,800 calories per head per day, averaged over the whole population.Estimated Food Requirements.(a) Lower Basis (Metric tons).1943.1944-GrainSugardried eggs      61,000 155,000Second half.
