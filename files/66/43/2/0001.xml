Day photographs show that several important factories, including Continental Gummi Werke(rubber and tyres) and Hanomag (A.F.Vs., tractors, &amp;c.) have been hit as well asrailway buildings and gas works, but no further extensive housing devastationhas been caused.Leipzig (20th/21st October).Details are not yet available of the results of this raid. It is, however,probable that bombing was scattered over a wide area and that Leipzig itselfdid not suffer heavily.Kassel (22nd/23rd October).Weather was clear -,&apos;er the target and plots of night photographs show thata particularly concentrated, attack was delivered. Daylight photographs were obtained on the 30th October and have not yet been fully analysed, but it is clearthat the main part of the town has been completely devastated and that therehas been very heavy industrial damage. Details will be provided in the nextsummary.Results of Previous Raids.Hanover.Of the four heavy attacks recently delivered on Hanover, the third on the8th/9th October was by far the most effective, the main weight of bombs being concentrated on the town itself.   The photographs taken after this attack show[26356] bSECRET,W.P. (43) 502.2nd November, 1943.
that the centre of the town over an area of approximately 1,000 acres has been almost completely devastated by fire, and that hardly a building of importance inthis area escaped damage. The exceptional volume and density of the smokepouring from the town on the clay following the attack showed that the fires were out of control, and some buildings in the centre of the town were still burningthree days after they had caught fire. The devastated area comprises the oldtown lying to the south of the main station and almost the whole of the south-eastward extension of the town. The greater part of this area is fully built-up and most of the houses there, many of which were half timbered, are now whollyuninhabitable. It is estimated that between 90,000 and 100,000 have been bombedout, a little less than a quarter of the town&apos;s population.The following are the more important industrial undertakings damaged : Hanomag (gun carriages, tractors, lorries, &amp;c).Wollwascherei (wool combers previously damaged in the attack of22nd/23rd September).Electrowerk Hannover (electrical engineers).Reinholcl and Co. (insulating material).Main Railway Station an important junction on the main line from berlin to the Ruhr and Holland.Main Town Gas Works the damage will probably reduce the supply atany rate to private houses to nil.In addition many civic and public buildings as well as goods depots and railway sidings have been damaged.Print No. 1 shows damage near the Goods Station.Munich.Full day cover of the results of the attack on the 2nd/3rd October has nowbeen obtained and shows considerable damage mainly to industrial premises inthe S.E. part of the City. Some of this is shown on prints Nos. 2, 3 and 4.Transport and public utilities have also suffered and there are many isolatedpoints of damage in other parts of the city.Print No. 5 shows clearly the cumulative effect of successive raids on essentialpublic utility services. The manufacturing plant of the town gas works (A) hasan annual capacity of nearly sixty million cubic metres per annum. The threeHolders whose destruction is shown in (B) are situated on the North side of theEast Munich Marshalling Yard, and are probably fed from the manufacturing-plant in (A).Stuttgart.Photographs taken after the attack on the 7th/8th October show consider-able damage, mostly to business and residential property in the centre of the city and the w-estern outskirts. Some small devastated.areas can be seen in the westcentral district. The Guildhall and Government Offices have been damaged orgutted and the City Hall has been razed to the ground.Bremen.Photographs taken after the daylight attack on the 8th October by aircraft of United States Bomber Command, and the night attack on the 8th/9th Octoberby Bomber Command, show damage throughout the town. There is concentrateddamage both in industrial areas and among shipping in the docks. Some detailsof damage caused are : (i) Weser Flugzeugbau. At least two medium-size buildings have been severely damaged.(ii) Deutsche Schiff u. Maschinenbau, A.G. (a) Large workshop gutted.(&amp;) Large building damaged by direct hit.(c) One floating dock submerged, possibly sunk.id) Two floating docks damaged by direct hits.(e) One coaster appears damaged.(/) At least three small buildings have been severely damaged.
(iii) Between akali Hafen and Hafen E. (a) Baumwoll Lager G.m.b.H.   A large multi-bay shop has been halfdemolished.(b) Three dockside buildings have been gutted or demolished.  .(c) One medium M/V in Hafen E. appears to be on fire.(iv) The railway tracks adjoining the Deutsche works have received two ormore direct hits.Kassel.A final interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the3vd/4th October confirms original reports of severe industrial damage in theS.E. part of the town. Business and residential property in villages to the N.and N.E. has also suffered severely, two villages being half destroyed.In addition to damage to industrial premises already reported, several buildings of the original works of Henschel &amp; Sons, producing locomotives,lorries, &amp;o., have been destroyed or damaged. In all, some 30 factories andindustrial concerns have been partly destroyed or damaged.Hagen.A final interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on thelst/2nd October shows that damage is heaviest in the south and centre of thetown, and in the districts of Altenhagen and Wehrmghausen. Many factories in the valleys south of the town have suffered severely. In addition to the heavy damage to the Accumulatoren Fabrik A.G., already reported, the Fahrradteile-fabrik Wipperman, makers of motor parts, have also suffered severely. Two steelworks and 11 factories engaged on specialised steel or iron work have been damaged, some of them extensively, and heavy damage has been caused to a glassworks and a paper factory.   Altogether, at least 39 factories have been affected.Damage to railway property is very severe. The Bahnhof Delstern in theS.E. has been destroyed, three large railway buildings near the Main HagenStation have been severely damaged or destroyed, and a bridge nearly 400 ft.long across the railway junction immediately north of the main station has been destroyed. The gas and electricity works at Altenhagen have been severely damaged, while among other municipal and public buildings which have been destroyed or severely damaged are the Town Hall, the Guildhall, MunicipalOffices, the Town Savings Bank and the Telegraph Office in Wehringhausen.Damage to business and residential property is severe, particularly in Altenhagenand in Wehringhausen. vFriedrichshafen.Photographs show that as a result of the small-scale attack on the night ofthe 7th /8th October, when 16 Lancasters were despatched to attack the ZeppelinWorks, a large workshop has been heavily damaged at each end. Business and residential property in the district also suffered.Frankfurt.A final interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the4th/5th October shows that the dam in the East Harbour received a direct hit,and the Oberrad Sluice in the River Main was hit immediately south of thecentral pier. On the 7th October, the third day after the attack, water was flowingunchecked through this sluice.Railway property in the eastern districts has suffered extensively. Thebuildings of the dock station near the East Harbour have been gutted and damage has been general in the marshalling yards north of the harbour. A tram depothas been heavily damaged and business and residential property has suffered severely, particularly as a result of fires. Among the public buildings affectedare the Rathaus, the Courts of Justice and the Customs House (on the EastHarbour quayside).Krujyps&apos; Production.It is now known that one result of our attacks earlier in the year was thatthe production of heavy guns by the Krupps Group in June 1943 was less thana quarter of the January output. More than a third of the output of field gunswas lost from the same cause.[26356] B 2
General. -It has been reported that after the attack on Mannheim on the 4th/5thOctober the authorities had considerable difficulty in controlling the populationowing to delay in carrying out evacuation. Disturbances were not quelled untilthe evening.Difficulty in the maintenance of order at both Frankfurt and Munich afterrecent attacks has also been reported. One of the noticeable features in thesetwo towns has been the refusal of the population to go to shelters. This nodoubt arises from rumours about the number of inhabitants of Hamburg, Hanoverand other cities who were incinerated in shelters when the fires got out of control.Air Ministry. 2nd November, 1943.A.
