THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF&apos;HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEN1Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 517.12th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.LONDON AIRFIELD FOR TRANSPORT  SERVICES.Report by the Lord President of the Council.1. The War Cabinet at their meeting on 1st November (W.M. (43) 148thConclusions, Minute 4) invited the following : Lord President of the Council (in the Chair);Chancellor of the Exchequer;Minister of Production;Lord Privy Seal;Secretary of State for Air;Minister of Health;Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries;VMinister of WTar Transport;- - Minister of Town and Country Planning; and&quot; Paymaster General;to consider and report on the proposal made by the Secretary of State for Air forthe establishment of a new airfield near London capable of accommodating heavytransport aircraft of the latest type.2. We have considered the Memoranda submitted by the Secretary ofState for Air (W.P. (43) 482) and the Minister of Health (W.P. (43) 498) togetherwith Memoranda by the Minister of War Transport and the Minister of Agricul-ture and Fisheries.   These are appended to this Note as Annexes A and B.3. The Secretary of State for Air&apos;s proposal to construct a modern airfield at Heath Row, near Staines, is put forward in the first instance to meet theimmediate and future military requirements of Transport Command, but also as providing an airfield which could be developed as an international civil airportfor the capital of the Empire after the war.4.   The project is a large one.Stage 1 (which gives runways of 3,000, 2,000 and 2,000 yards) takesfourteen months to complete and costs  5 million. It involves demolishing130 houses and 8 factories.Stage 2 (which gives runways of 5,000, 3,000 and 3,000 yards) costs an extra  2f million and involves demolishing 58 more houses and 4 morefactories. More serious, it would involve the removal of the MiddlesexCounty Council sludge disposal works. These were built shortly before thewar.   They took two years to complete and cost  500,000.Stage 3 would cost yet a further  15^ million and would involve thedemolishing of nearly 1,400 houses and other buildings.5. Stage 1 of the scheme also means taking over 1,000 acres of land nowused to grow vegetables. The total annual value of crops produced from agri-cultural land in the Stage 1 area is  625,000. The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries points out that the amount of land in the near neighbourhood of Londonsuitable for growing fresh vegetables has already been greatly encroached on and that further encroachments are threatened. He has asked that the Air Min istrvshould examine whether, if the Heath Row scheme is proceeded with, theycannot give up Heston or other airfields in the London area.[26414]
6. From the transport point of view the scheme would also add substantial sums to the cost of the by-pass or arterial roads planned in the neighbourhood.The Ministry of War Transport take the view, however, that this additional cost would form part of the cost of a comprehensive improvement of the mainroutes to the West and South-West, the need for which is already apparent.7. Construction of this airfield would require 2.000 men at the beginningof Stage 1, rising later to 3,000 men. This does not include the labour requiredfor re-housing displaced civilians, or reconstructing the sludge works, and so forth. If the scheme were to be started now, it would add to the strain on resources already severely stretched.8. It seems clear that Stage 2 could not be started until towards the end of1945. In our view no case has been made out on military grounds for givingauthority for the work to be proceeded with up to the end of Stage 2.9. The case on military grounds for Stage 1 rests on the fact that transport aircraft requiring a runway of 3,000 yards are already in operational use. It istrue that we have a number of airfields large enough to accommodate aircraft ofthis size. But nearly all of them are required for operational purposes and none of them are near to London. The airfields at present used for large transport aircraft are Lyneham, St. Mawgan and Prestwick. Much time is lost bytravellers by air in having to proceed to an airfield at a distance from London,only to find when they get there that the weather is not suitable for them to takeoff.10. We turn now to the case for starting work on the Heath Row airfieldfor civil air transport purposes after the war.11. There can be no doubt that London will need a modern civil airport.But should it be at Heath Row and need we start work on it during the war ?12. Heath Row is well situated from the point of view of both road and rail transport&apos;into London, although substantial new construction would be needed togive really good road and rail access from the centre. We are informed that,after prolonged search, no other area can be found on which an airfield can be built capable of accommodating the heaviest types of transport aircraft building or in contemplation, unless either recourse was had to very extensive demolitionor the airfield was to be very considerably further away from London.13. In our view the claims of Heath Row to be adopted as the site for thefuture international airport for London are certainly sufficiently strong to justifyus in making sure that the site is sterilised until such time as a final decision hasbeen reached.14. Nevertheless, we have reached the conclusion that before this very largescheme is accepted, in its entirety, it ought to be examined in relation to the needsof the country as a whole for civil airports. The Air Ministry are preparing a-review which wull shortly be completed of post-war civil aviation in this country,which will cover airports. We think that this scheme should be considered inrelation to the demands likely to be made for civil airports generally, and theresources which can be devoted for these purposes after the War, before a finaldecision is reached.15. But whatever decision is reached about civil airports generally, an airfield wall certainly be needed for civil purposes in the near neighbourhood ofLondon which provides better facilities than can be made available on any of theexisting airfields in the London area.Recommendations.16. We therefore recommend, subject to the conditions set out in thefollowing paragraph, that the Air Ministry should be authorised now to proceedwith Stage 1 of the Heath Row scheme at an estimated cost of  5 million.17. This recommendation is subject to the proviso that the Air Ministry aresatisfied that the labour required can be made available from whatever allocation of building labour is granted to them, and that they will not ask for any specialaddition on account of this project. We understand that the Secretary of Statefor Air accepts this position. It is also subject to satisfactory assurances being-given that none of the factories which will have to be dislodged are of special importance from the point of view of war production.
18. We recommend that a decision as to Stages 2 and 3 should be deferred until the Air Ministry scheme for the development of civil airports after the war has been received, and that it should be further considered in the light of that scheme. In the meantime the Minister of Town and. Country Planning shouldbe authorised to take such action as may be necessary forthwith to sterilise theland required for Stages 2 and 3 of the scheme.We also recommend that the Minister of Health should be authorised to invite the Middlesex County Council to examine the possibility of providing a new sludge disposal works to replace the one at Heath-Row, and to find outhow long replacement would take.C. R. A.(on behalf of the Committee.)Privy Council Office, S. W. 1,12th November, 1943.ANNEX A.Note by the Minister of War . Transport.1. The proposal of the Secretary of State for Air in W.P. (43) 482 raisesa series of road problems affecting not only local communications but importantthrough routes.2. At a point slightly to the East of the proposed site the Great West Roaddivides into the Bath Road running due West and the Trunk Road toSouthampton and the South-West. Stage 1 would involve the closing of a Class Icircumferential route linking these two important trunk routes. It carries a heavy traffic, and it would be necessary to construct a new road about 3 miles long-to replace it. A good deal of demolition of property would be involved and thenew road would cost about  200,000. A Class II road would also have to be abandoned.3. The Southampton Road runs through Staines, and, in order to avoid itsnarrow and congested streets, a by-pass to the north of the town Was plannedbefore the war at an estimated cost of  850,000. It would have been one of theearliest road improvements to be undertaken after hostilities ceased. Stage would involve its abandonment and either the substitution of a by-pass to Staineson a new line at an increased cost of  250,000, or, alternatively, the acceleration of the improvement of other important routes and early construction of newarterial roads, the cost of which cannot at present be estimated, but wouldcertainly be very high.4. The limits of the proposed airfield border the south side of theBath Road. This road, which consists at present of a single carriage-way of40 ft., was scheduled for widening before the war. The north side of the roadis already developed ,and the widening would have been on the south side, butthis would apparently be precluded by the airfield if the proposed limits must beaccepted in their entirety. It would probably then be necessary to replace thissection of the Bath Road by a new road running further to the north.5. If the site is to be developed as an international airfield, rapid access to and from London will be essential. There are several lines of railway runningin close proximity, but they carry heavy traffic already, and the provision ofnew and improved railway connections into the airfield will be required to enablefast express services to be run. In addition, it will be necessary to consider theprovision of a high-speed road from the West End of London to the airfield.The Great West Road constitutes the natural approach, but its suitability forthe purpose is impaired by almost continual frontage development with numerouspoints of access to factories and houses. Very costly improvements or new construction might therefore be necessary.
ANNEX B.Memorandum by the Minister, of Agriculture and Fisheries.1. In the memorandum attached to the note by the Secretary of State forAir (W.P. (43) 482), it was stated that the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheriesare concerned about the effect of the proposals on food production and post-waragriculture.   This is so.2. The area is question is mainly alluvium, with small areas of brick earth,overlying gravel, and eminently suitable for market gardening purposes.3. As regards the land which will be required for Stage 1 of the AirMinistry&apos;s scheme, approximately 1,000 acres are devoted to vegetables, most ofwhich is cropped on an average 1-8 times per annum, yielding approximately,800 acres of vegetables annually. Cereal crops are grown in rotation. Pig-keeping is a feature and is run in conjunction with market gardening to providemanure and to use up any surplus produce, supplemented by town swill collected by market lorries returning from Covent Garden or Brentford markets, and this area supplies all vegetables for London consumption. The total annual valueof croDS from the agricultural land in the area affected by Stage 1 is not less than 625,000.4. Apart from the immediate war-time production, one of the greatnutritional problems facing the country post-war will be the provision of adequate supplies of fresh vegetables. It is a question of having sufficient suitable landwithin easy reach of the large consuming centres.5. There are three main blocks of suitable land near to London in N.W.Kent, Middlesex and S.W. Essex. These were all largely encroached upon byunregulated pre-war building and further encroachments are threatened.6. In Essex, for example, there were some 47,000 acres of land speciallysuitable for market gardening, but fully half of this has already been built over,e.g., Romford, Dagenham, &amp;c.7. The L.C.C. now want a new satellite town at Aveley in the heart of theremaining area, although there is other less valuable agricultural land near by.This proposal is still under discussion.8. In Middlesex the area of land potentially suitable for market gardeningwas about 40,000 acres, of which nearly 75 per cent, has already been lost to agriculture.9. Stage 1 alone of the airfield proposal means sacrificing over 20 per cent,of the remaining market gardening area in Middlesex. Stages 2 and 3 will involve further losses.10. In the circumstances I submit that the present and future loss of food,and particularly valuable protective food at that, is too great for the Air Ministryproposal to be accepted.R, S. H.
