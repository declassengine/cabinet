(43) 520.lQth November, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE GERMAN LONG-RANGE ROCKET AND CIVIL DEFENCESTRENGTHS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.1. As the War Cabinet are aware, I have made every effort to meet thedemand for labour for the Forces and the productive war effort by reducing thestrengths of the various Civil Defence Services (Police, National Fire Service and civil Defence (General) Services) to what I regarded as the minimum necessary forthe discharge of their responsibilities. In July of this year, I agreed that reduc-tions approved by the Cabinet in December 1942, amounting to 75.000, from thestrength of the combined Services (which at one time exceeded 400,000) shouldbe increased by a further 15,000, amounting to 90,000 in all, so that by the endof this vear the three Services should stand at a total strength of 293,600 (Police81,100;&quot; National Fire Service 119,200; General Services 93,300). That was before the threatened long-range rocket bombardment of the Metropolis andcertain towns on the south coast was regarded as a real possibility.2. In the light of the recent decision of the Government to take this threatseriously, and in view of the unprecedented strain which heavy and sustainedrocket bombardment would throw upon Civil Defence arrangements in the areasattacked, I am concerned as Minister of Home Security to see that the arrange -ments for dealing with the casualties and damage to property and lines ofcommunication are adequate.3. With the uncertainty that necessarily prevails as to the scale andfrequency of possible attack in built-up areas, no reasonably exact estimate canbe formed of the number of rescue parties needed to clear large-scale incidents in the number which might be caused by a prolific use of the new weapon. Allthat can be said is that from past experience of heavy night raiding the civil defence Services in London (where they are relatively and proportionately in thegreatest strength) aided by such reinforcements from other districts as can bemade available, will be incapable of dealing with the situation after one or two days of bombardment on the maximum scale envisaged as a possibility before christmas. The War Cabinet realises that military reinforcements on a very substantial scale will be needed. As the soldiers will consist largely of men whohave not been trained in rescue and first aid work, they will want expert guidance.It would, therefore, be a very serious step to deplete further the Civil defence services of their trained personnel.4. At one time, the peak figure of all Services stood, at over 400,000. In thepast year they have already been considerably thinned out. I am, however, pledgedby the end of the year to come down to a target figure of 293,000 for the Police,National Fire Service and Civil Defence (General) Services, and, indeed, I am nowin the final stages of reduction. In the Police and National Fire Service I am prepared to keep to my undertaking, though I should naturally prefer to retain some 2,700 men still due to be released from the Metropolitan Police. Naturalwastage will bring the National Fire Service down to the agreed target by the[26425]
end of the year. In the Civil Defence General Services, which have been more heavily cut than the others, there are now or were recently on offer to theMinistry of Labour and National Service but not yet placed in employment 4,500men and women, and a further 3,500 are due to be placed on offer for release.5. I realise the importance of the absorption into productive industry of all available manpower, and I cannot claim that the retention of the few thousandCivil Defence personnel in question would avoid the necessity of military reinforce-ments. On the other hand, it is important to note that the Civil Defence (General)Services consist largely of people well over military age and (saving only theRescue Service which was recruited to some extent from the building industry)without any special industrial qualification. (The Services have long since beencombed out for key-men.) The men and women offered to the Ministry of Labourunder the present arrangements are admittedly and inevitably difficult placingmaterial, although it is a reasonable assumption that in their present occupationthey are capable of giving a good account of themselves. I feel that if and. whenthe time comes to inform local authorities of the threatened attack, and theyare made aware that their main defences may have to consist of untrained troops,they will fail to understand why the Government have insisted and are insistingupon a weakening of passive defence arrangements by the loss of skilled personnel on the eve of a greater strain than that to -which they have yet been put.8. In order to satisfy the public that all reasonable steps have been takento deal with the menace of the possible discharge upon the Metropolis in the nearfuture of some 10.000 tons of high explosive within a period of less than a week,I think the War Cabinet will wish to consider whether the Minister of Labourand National Service and I should not be authorised to postpone, until the situa-tion becomes clearer, any further reduction in the Civil Defence Services requiredto bring them clown to the target figure of 293,000 settled in July.II.
