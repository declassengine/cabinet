Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 523.22nd November, 1943.POSSIBLE LINES OF A. POLISH-SOVIET SETTLEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to see the annexed memorandum on thepossible lines of a Polish-Soviet settlement, by which I would propose to be guidedshould it prove practicable to take this question up in the near future.A. E.Foreign Office, 22nd November, 1943.ANNEX.OUR view has been that the main difficulty is the question of frontiers.We consider that the only possible solution, which, would in fact be in Poland&apos;sown interest, is for the future frontier to be based on the Curzon Line. This ismore favourable to the Poles than the Ribbentrop-Molotov Line, for which the SovietGovernment will no doubt press, in that it includes in Poland the Bialystokarea in the north, whose inhabitants are mainly racial Poles. We should tryas part of a comprehensive settlement to persuade the Russians to be generousand allow the Poles to keep Lwow. It would, I think, be out of the question to press for Vilna for the Poles, except possibly as an opening bargaininggambit. We should, I think, suggest that such a settlement should be accompaniedby transfers of populations, more particularly in Eastern Galicia, to remove, so faras possible, racial minorities from each side of the frontier.In return, the Poles should receive a definite assurance from the SovietGovernment and His Majesty&apos;s Government, and, if possible, the United StatesGovernment, that they will receive in compensation East Prussia, Danzig, andthe Oppeln district of Upper Silesia. This arrangement would also be accompanied by transfers of population if this were considered desirable.The Poles, however, fear that what is at stake is not so much the frontiersas the future existence of Poland. Their anxieties are (1) that Russia&apos;s long-term aim is to set up a puppet Government in Warsaw and turn Poland into a soviet republic, (2) that disorders would be provoked on the entry of soviet forces, (3) that it will then be impossible to maintain the present instructions of the Polish Government restraining the Polish population from taking actionagainst the Russians, and . (4) that all the leading resistance elements in Polandwill be disposed of by the Soviet forces of occupation.It is therefore necessary to secure from the Russians, in return for our undertaking to impose on the Poles a frontier settlement on the above lines,assurances to the following effect:  (1) Diplomatic relations should be restored at once between the Soviet and polish Governments;(2) Arrangements should be made on similar lines to those contemplatedfor our other European Allies for the Polish Government to returnto Poland and be associated with the Administration of the country as soon as military necessities permit;(3) The Polish Government should submit themselves to the approval of thePolish people as soon as possible and the latter should be free to choose their own Government without any outside pressitre:12203   [26453]Copy No.WAR CABINET.
(4) The Polish Government should at once be encouraged to accede to theSoviet-Czechoslovak Treaty, as provided for under the Protocolattached to the treaty, thus instituting a tripartite system of security in Eastern Europe, for which Poland will be one of the mainbeneficiaries;(5) These arrangements should be formally approved by His majesty government and if possible the United States Government. Theymight be associated with them in whatever way is considered most appropriate, e.g., either through some public declaration, participa-tion m the Tripartite Treaty (see under (C) below), or througharrangements to be worked out in the London Commission.The following are among the major difficulties which may arise in the aboveprogramme :  (A) The Soviet Government may insist upon some changes in the Polishgovernmental machine. So far as the Government itself is concerned, there isno adequate reason for any such changes. The Polish Government is composedof all parties from the Centre to the Left and contains no members to whom theSoviet Government could legitimately object. There is certainly no way in whichit could be reconstituted to make it more acceptable to the Russians, since theonly important people outside the Government are Soviet &quot; bogies.&quot; such asMessrs. Bieleczki and Zaleski. The Soviet Government really object to thePresident and to General Sosnkowski as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish forces.Clearly the President cannot be removed at the behest of a foreign Government.Moreover, both he and General Sosnkowski have been much more &quot; reasonable &quot;in recent months, and all our evidence suggests that the divergences which onceexisted between them and M. Mikolajczyk have been removed, and that GeneralSosnkowski has refrained from intervening in political matters. We also have some evidence that the latter fully realises the necessity for an arrangement withthe Russians on the basis of the loss of the Eastern provinces but prefers thatM. Mikolajczyk should take the responsibility for this. If General Sosnkowskiwere to be removed from his post as Commander-in-Chief, the only possible alternative candidate would be General Anders, who is presumably at least assuspect to the Russians. Since the Polish forces under our own command consistof over 100,000 men who are shortly going into the front line for the first time,of sixteen air squadrons, a cruiser, several destroyers, submarines and other small craft, we clearly cannot in the interests of the Allied war effort lightly contemplateprovoking serious troubles among the Polish troops. The removal of GeneralSosnkowski. more particularly if coupled with the banning of General Anders ashis successor at the behest of the Soviet Government, would undoubtedly under-mine the confidence and fighting morale of the Polish forces. I submit, therefore,that we should be ill-advised to contemplate any such solution and that we shouldfrankly explain the position to the Soviet Government. Our explanation couldbe coupled with assurances (1) that the Polish Government as a whole, and notGeneral Sosnkowski. are controlling the resistance groups in Poland; (2) that thesabotage material we are supplying to Poland is only for use against the Germans;(-3) that we have no intention of arming the Polish resistance groups on any large scale; but (4) that the Polish Government, in close agreement with us, are nowpreparing a rising in Poland against Germany at a moment to be mutually agreedupon between the Allies, either before or at the very moment of the entry of soviet troops into Poland.(B) The Soviet Government may press for the association of the Union of polish Patriots in some way with the Polish Government. I do not think&apos; wecould or should persuade the Poles to accept, say, Wanda Wasilewska or GeneralBerling in their Government. There may possibly be other Poles in Russia who could be brought in in some way, but I doubt whether this is a really important point on which the Soviet Government would insist. They are not usually prone tofight the battles of their proteges once the latter are no longer of use to them.If, and only if, the Polish Divisions in Russia could be reunited with thePolish troops abroad would it be really worth while to attempt to persuade thePolish Government to accept some face-saving device for bringing the Union of polish Patriots into their Councils.(C) The Polish Government on their side wish to be assured that we shallnot simply throw them into the arms of the Russians and then abandon them.
They have the Munich precedent very much in mind. It is, I submit, essential for our.own good name, as well as to satisfy the Poles, that we should make itcrystal clear that this settlement differs from Munich in that (i) the Poles receiveadequate compensation in the west for their losses in the east; and (ii) that they receive an effective instead of an ineffective guarantee of their future securityfrom the Western Powers as well as from Russia. General declarations of approval will not, I submit, suffice. It will, I think, be necessary to contemplate the arrangement already suggested in the War Cabinet paper W.P. (43) 423 ofthe 28th September, paragraph 8 of which reads as follows : &quot; There remains the question of our own participation [i.e., in theproposed tripartite Soviet-Czech-Polish treaty]. Unless we participate insome way, there is little chance of reaching a stable and satisfactory solutionof this Eastern European question. We are still bound by our alliance with poland, and although we refused a request from the Polish Government in1942 to negotiate a new Anglo-Polish ti-treaty to replace that of August 1939,we then informed the Polish Government that &apos; we should, of course, enterinto consultation Avith them in good time before August 1944 &apos; (whenthe 1939 treaty can be terminated by either party), &apos; so that the two Govern-ments might consider how best to maintain and prolong its effects.&apos; Weadded that we should prefer this consultation to take place &apos; when thefuture was clearer and when the two Governments could also consider, inter alia, how best Anglo-Polish relations could be fitted into a regional or general system of security.&apos; We also informed the Polish Government inApril 1942 that we intended to ; uphold the interests of our Polish ally, as ofour other allies, to the fullest extent to which we were capable, and that forthis purpose we would, accept our full share of responsibility for the estab-lishment and maintenance of peace in Europe after the war.&apos; Our existing agreement with Poland could thus by merged in a new Four-PowerTreaty.&quot;This question of our own. participation originally raised in W.P. (43) 423is clearly a difficult one, which will require careful thought.I submit that our approach to the Russians should be based upon theconsideration that Anglo-Soviet relations having now been placed upon a footingof mutual confidence by the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Moscow Conference,we are most anxious to remove any possible source of friction. Having regardto our treaty and other obligations to Poland and to the outstanding part played by Poles at home and abroad in resistance to Germany since 1939, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and British public opinion are bound to do all in their power toensure that a strong and independent Poland emerges from the war. This they also feel to be in the general European interest, as well as in the interest of goodAnglo-Polish and Anglo-Soviet relations. Any failure to achieve a reasonable would inevitably become a running sore in Anglo-Soviet relations,and this His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined to make every effort to avoid.
