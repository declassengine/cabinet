THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET.Copy No. d 4W.P. (43) 523.18th November,1943.WAR CABINET.NEWFOUNDLAND.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.I. Newfoundland should be offered the right to resume Dominion statusat any time during the war or after it.2. The claim is put forward that the present Commission of Government isunconstitutional, and its acts will inevitably be challenged. This contention isbased on Clause I of the Newfoundland Act, 1933, which makes it clear that the suspension of the Constitution was limited by the terms of the Address to HisMajesty by the Legislative Council and House of Assembly of Newfoundlandto a period until such time as the island may become self-supporting again. ButNewfoundland is now self-supporting, so it is argued. It has a surplus of11 million dollars. Therefore the legal basis of Commission Government has been destroyed. Now, if we neglect to give self-government to Newfoundland, we mustbe prepared to meet and destroy this argument. It is my view that we will failin convincing the people of Newfoundland.3. Newfoundland has lent us 8 million dollars, most of it interest-free. Ithas given 500,000 dollars to the Spitfire Fund for the purchase of aircraft and,by voluntary subscription among the public, has provided another 150,000 dollars to that Fund.4. The agitation in Newfoundland for the restoration of self-government is widespread. Practically all the newspapers participate in the campaign. among them may be mentioned the Daily Neivs of St. John&apos;s, the Grand Falls Advertiser,the Fishermen-Workers&apos; Tribune, the Observer&apos;s Weekly, the Evening Telegram,the Neivfoundland Trade Review, and the Western Star.5. The Newfoundland public is entirely dissatisfied with the Commissionand the unpopularity of that body grows steadily.6. Six Trade Union leaders met at St. John&apos;s on the 13th April and passed a resolution asking for the restoration of self-government.7. The Newfoundland Board of Trade, meeting on the 29th March, passed a resolution asking that representative government be set up, as a matter ofurgent need.8. There is resistance in newspapers, amounting to claims of repudiationof the transactions relating to the bases.9. The claim that the Newfoundland Government fell through corruptionis not now accepted. It is believed that the measure was taken to benefit bond-holders and supply Canadian banks with repayment of their overdraft. In fact,it is believed that Canadian banks helped to precipitate the financial crisis.10. The advantages of a restored Dominion status are manifold. It wouldbe a protection against Canada&apos;s unjust claim over Goose Bay and the pretensionswhich the United States will advance to civil air bases in Newfoundland.II. With Dominion status, Newfoundland will safeguard our imperial interests in the Western Atlantic against any &quot; ganging up &quot; by Canada and theUnited States, always a possibility under a different Government.B.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W. 118th November, 1943.[26442]
