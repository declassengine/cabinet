THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 533.2Uh November, 1943. //WAR CABINET.RED ARMY DAY, 1944.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.RED Army Day will be celebrated in the Soviet Union on the 23rd February,1944. The Ministry of Information will be glad of an early decision as towhether the Government wishes it to be signalised by any officially organiseddemonstration in this country.2. The same question was before the War Cabinet last year (W.M. (42) 131,Minute 12, and W.M. (43) 16, Minute 8). Red Army Day was then chosen as theoccasion of official celebration. Three reasons led to this decision : Firstly, a desire to pay a striking tribute to the achievements of the Red Army. Secondly,a feeling that this particular occasion (the twenty-fifth anniversary of the red army&apos;s foundation) was free from political complications. And. thirdly, a desireto associate His Majesty&apos;s Government officially with an occasion which otherwise would certainly have been sponsored and patronised by some of the Anglo-Russianorganisations that are controlled by the Communist Party.3. The arrangements were carried through by the Ministry of Information.During the week-end of the 20th/21st February twelve public meetings in largeprovincial towns were addressed by Ministers of Cabinet rank, the meetings inmost cases being preceded by parades of the Fighting Services, the Civil defence services and war workers generally. In London a more elaborate demonstrationwas staged at the Albert Hall, in the course of which the Foreign Secretary spoke.4. This venture was an undoubted success, both here and in Russia, TheSoviet Embassy sent representatives to all the meetings and M. Maisky afterwardsexpressed his warm appreciation of them. Considerable space was given by theRussian newspapers to the carefully designed speeches of our Ministers and filmsof the event were shown in the Russian cinemas. In this country the demonstra-tion helped to dispel the idea, which was at that time being fomented by theCommunist Party in this country, that His Majesty&apos;s Government was insincerein its professions of friendship for its Soviet Ally.5. In deciding the course to be followed this year, the following considera-tions are relevant : (1) The exploits of the Red Army during the year have been more strikingthan ever. Failure to repeat our tribute to it may give rise tounfavourable comment.(2) On the other hand, a second year&apos;s observance would tend to establishcontinuity. Red Army Day is not, I imagine, intended to develop into an annual official occasion; nor do we wish to provoke demands for similar Days in honour of other Allies.(3) The absence of an official celebration will leave a gap wmieh theCommunist Party of Great Britain wall be ready to fill.(4) The practical difficulties of repeating anything like last year&apos;s arrange-ments are very great. Ministerial speeches would have to repeat thesame theme. Parades alone, especially in February, are somewhatunsatisfactory and throw a considerable burden on the militaryauthorities. The Ministry of Information last year produced a sort of.musical pageant at the Albert Hall, but they would be reluctant toundertake this a second year.[26474]
6. On the whole we recommend that the Government refrain from organisingany official demonstrations for Red Army Day 1944. But if this decision is takenwe must recognise that the occasion will be celebrated, perhaps in quite a largeway, by private organisations more or less under Communist influence. If the strict rule of boycotting all such affairs is observed, the Government may find itself in some difficult situations, since Allied Governments regularly attend these functions. I suggest, therefore, that we should envisage some relaxation of this rule for this occasion, provided that no action is taken without prior consultationwith the Home Secretary.B B.Mth November, 194g.
