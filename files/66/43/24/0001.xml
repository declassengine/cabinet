Day photographs which have since beenobtained show a large amount of fresh damage. In particular, a number of factories on which repair work had been carried out since Dusseldorf was lastattacked, on the 11th/ 12th June, have again been hit.Cologne (3rd/4th November),The condition of Cologne is such that it is almost impossible to discover onphotographs the results of the small diversionary attack made by 62 aircraft.As far as can be seen, the Cathedral has not suffered severe damage, but it mayhave received minor damage, not visible in vertical photographs, from a direct hit on the railway station nearby.Results of Previous Raids.Kassel.Photographs of Kassel taken eight days after the attack on the22nd/23rd October show that the main part of the town has been devastated,over 96 per cent, of the property within it being destroyed. Industry within thetown itself has been almost completely demolished and there is extremely heavyindustrial damage in the suburbs. The photographs show clearly that fires ragedunchecked over large areas. In the most important of the Henschel factories,which produce locomotives, tanks and lorries, most of the smaller buildings havebeen completely destroyed and the larger workshops damaged. Salzmann &amp; Co.,important manufacturers of uniforms for the Army, has again been hit. Inall, 51 factories suffered in this attack, including five firms engaged on theproduction of precision instruments and special machine tools.Further serious damage has been done to rolling-stock and marshalling yards,and great devastation caused to barracks and military stores.[26439]

These areas are nowclearly seen on later photographs, and the full extent of the damage is revealed.The buildings which had been seen burning have been completely gutted, and insome cases the fires have spread to neighbouring property and caused moredestruction. Further damage to the chemical plant of I.G. Farbenindustrie isobserved, but taking into account the vast size of the works, and the speed withwhich repairs have been carried out in the past, it cannot be regarded as heavy.Other industries affected include a shipbuilding yard, factories engaged onwoodworking, ships&apos; carpentry, ice production, and others of wdiich the functionis not yet known. A number of dockside buildings are also involved. Severalbarges have suffered from fire, and two are seen in a waterlogged condition.Additional points of damage caused by the attack on the 4th / 5th October can also be observed.
