Two of H.M. minesweepers with five Russian minesweepers and sixRussian motor launches left Iceland (C) on the 22nd, and, covered by British naval forces, arrived at Murmansk on the 30th.Home Waters.*3. Early on the 28th two Dutch M.T.Bs. off the North Foreland engagedtwo E-boats, one of which was damaged.  Both M.T.Bs. sustained slight damage.In an attack on a coastal convoy off Hastings on the night of the 2nd/3rd,one E-boat was probably sunk and two others damaged by H.M.S. WHITSHED(destroyer). On the following night our coastal forces engaged E-boats and aheavily-escorted convoy off the Dutch coast. One trawler was sunk and two -boats, a trawler and a cargo-ship were seriously damaged&apos;. One M.T.B. was sunk and others were damaged. Coastal batteries opened fire on two enemy destroyers southbound off Calais.Mediterranean.4. U.S. warships have carried out two bombardments of the Italian main-land. On the 27th the U.S.S. Brooklyn (cruiser) with two U.S. destroyers bombarded the Mihturno area, north-west of Naples, and on the 30th the US.destroyer Waimoright shelled the road and railway junction north of Volturno.On the night of the 25th/26th E-boats made an unsuccessful attack onMaples harbour.On the 31st a German raiding party, some 70 strong, was landed frombarges and two E-boats on Capraia Island (N.E. of Bastia). The telegraph and wireless office was destroyed, and one officer and five civilians were taken prisoner.5. Allied destroyers have maintained patrols in the Adriatic and betweenSpezia and Elba. On the 3rd, U.S. light forces sank a 4,000-ton escorted tankeroff&apos; Elba.   One U.S. M.T.B. was damaged but suffered no casualties.6.   The following attacks have been reported by HM. submarines : On the 22nd Unseen sank an F-lighter in the Gulf of Genoa. Ultimatumtorpedoed and probably sank a 3,000-ton ship in convoy off Toulon on the 27th.Ulior sank a passenger ship of 3,500 tons off Rapallo on the 29th.7. Arrangements have been made for the return by the Italians of allwarships previously belonging to the United Nations.Levant.8. Allied destroyers supported by H.M. cruisers have continued to landtroops and stores at Leros throughout the week, and sweeps have been carriedout in the surrounding waters. On the night of the 23rd/24th seven tons of petrol, six Bofors guns, 15 tons of ammunition, ten tons of food and a jeep were landed from H.M. S/M Rorqual; on the following day 80 tons of stores reachedLeros by caique from Samos. Five Italian submarines are acting as supply ships in the Levant.9. On the night of the 23rd/24th, 50 all ranks were taken in two of H.M.M.Ls. from Leros to Levitha with the object of recapturing an Allied patroland destroying the enemy garrison. The raid was unsuccessful and the wholeparty is missing.
10. On the 30th H.M.S. Aurora (cruiser), when in company with three destroyers, was attacked by 24 Ju. 87s and hit abaft the funnel. All her 4&quot; guns were put out of action, but she was not damaged below the waterline and returnedto Alexandria, where repairs will take about ten weeks. H.M.S. Belvoir(destroyer) was hit by a bomb which failed to explode; she sustained no serious damage.On the 27th a small convoy of tank landing craft was attacked by aircraftoff Kastelorizo and L.C.T. 115 was sunk. Twenty-two military personnel were killed.During the week 79 survivors from H.M. Destroyers Eclipse and Hurworthand from the garrison of Kos reached Kastelorizo. Of the troops on boardEclipse, three officers and 38 other ranks reached Leros.11. H.M. S/M T orb ay sank a caique off Leros on the 15th and on thefollowing day a 1,000-ton ship in convoy off Naxos. ELM. S/M Unsparing sank a small troopship and an R-boat laden with troops on the 1st.Pacific.12. The Japanese Fleet has not made any attempt in strength to interferewith the U.S. operations in the Northern Solomons and the main fleet is believed to be at Truk.Solomons.13. U.S. warships and an amphibious force of the Pacific Fleet have carried out an Allied landing on Bougainville Island. U.S. troops were landedon Choiseul Island by four destroyers.While landing on Treasury Island two landing craft were damaged bymortar fire and one destroyer was damaged by aircraft.On the 1st a U.S. cruiser and destroyers bombarded areas in the north andsouth of Bougainville. No details are yet available concerning the naval actionoff Bougainville on the 2nd.New Guinea.14. Allied M.T.B.S have been operating against barge traffic in the VitiazStraits, but they have experienced difficulty whilst working close inshore onaccount of well distributed Japanese batteries.A convoy of two large transports and two other ships was sighted south ofNew Hanover on the 26th steering west, probably bound for WewaJk withreinforcements. *New Britain.15. On the 29th one cruiser and three destroyers were sighted approachingMundua Island from the south; it is believed that they were bringing troops from Rabaul.Enemy warships and shipping were seriously damaged in an air attack onRabaul on the 2nd.Far Eastern Waters.16. On the 29th, it was reported that U.S. submarines had recently sunkten enemy ships, including a tanker, a transport and a large cargo ship. four ships, including one large cargo ship, were damaged.Anti-Submarine Operations.17. Twenty-nine attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week.Ten of these were by shore-based aircraft, four by carrier-borne aircraft, one by submarine and 14 by surface craft.On the 28th aircraft from the U.S.S. Block Island (auxiliary carrier) sank one U-boat and possibly another north-west of the Azores, and on the following day H.M. ships Duncan (destroyer) and Sunflower (corvette) sank one north-east of Newfoundland. Aircraft from the U.S.S. Card (auxiliary carrier) sank onenorth-west of the Azores on the 30th. IT.M. ships Douglas (destroyer) andImperialist (A/S trawler) sank one in the Strait of Gibraltar on the 31st, andon the following day H.M.S. Fleetwood (sloop) sank another in the same locality.[26366] B
A U-boat was probably sunk, and another possibly sunk, by the U.S.S. Borie(destroyer) north of the Azores on the 1st. ELM. ships Whitehall (destroyer),Geranium (corvette) and Rochester (sloop) possibly sank one west of cape finisterre on the 31st, and another was possibly sunk by H.M. S/M Ultimatumwest of Corsica on the same day. Aircraft possibly damaged two U-boats, in the bay of Biscay and off Newfoundland. .       .Provisional figures for the month of October are 105 attacks on U-boats,25 (including one Japanese) sunk or probably sunk, nine possibly sunk and twopossibly damaged.Enemy Intelligence.18. On the 3rd, 13 enemy landing craft and two E-boats were sighted atthe entrance to the Gulf of Athens; on the same day seven F-boats and two small ships were seen near Kos. Reports state that landing barges sent by rail havebeen collecting at the Piraeus since the 28th, and that naval personnel in largenumbers have arrived at Athens.Two troopships and two ships laden with war material left the Piraeus on the27th and 28th.U-boats.19. During the week, apart from some activity to the west of the Bay of biscay and in the Gulf of Guinea, there has been no aggressive action by U-boats.Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked and sunkthree ships. One ship in homeward bound convoy from the Mediterranean was sunk north-west of Cape Finisterre, one ship in eastbound convoy was sunk offAlgiers, and one ship was sunk south-east of Lagos.Two ships were sunk and another torpedoed by E-boats in a westboundcoastal convoy off Hastings.One ship was sunk by aircraft at Samos.A provisional figure for shipping losses from enemy action during Octoberis 107,000 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.21. During the week ending the 30th, 931 ships were convoyed. Of these,345 ships were in ocean convoys and 586 in British coastal convoys. Two escortcarriers, 60 destroyers (including one U.S. destroyer) and 133 sloops, cutters,frigates and corvettes (including nine U.S. cutters, one Dutch sloop and oneDutch minelayer) were employed on escort duties.Four ocean convoys, consisting of 130 ships, arrived in Home Waters without loss.British Minelaying.22. Surface craft laid mines in the Channel, but no minelaying by aircraft has taken place owing to bad weather.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.23. On one night in the week enemy aircraft probably laid rnines betweenBeach)&apos; Head and Lyme Bay.Seven ground and six moored mines have been destroyed in Home - Watersduring the week.   The mine totals are : 4,516 ground and 3,514 moored.24. On the 2nd, 26 Italian moored mines were destroyed in the approaches to the Bay of Naples. Dangerous areas have been declared off the west andsouth-west coasts of Sardinia.Suspected minefields in the iEgean have been reported off Naxos andStampalia and to the eastward of Kalymnos.Thirty-one mines have been destroyed off St. John&apos;s, Newfoundland.Enemy Merchant Shipping.25. On the 31st, at Cartagena, a boat from the German s.s. Lvpari blew upwhile attempting to sabotage the Italian tanker Lavoro (7,886 tons).
The Spanish s.s. Sebastian (3,024 tons), on passage to France with a cargo of iron ore, was intercepted by H.M.S. Tynedale (destroyer) on the 29th and takeninto Gibraltar.Recently ships suitable for carrying troops have been included in the move-ment of enemy shipping northward through the Strait of Dover. Since the1st May, 1943, identified losses among troopships and military supply ships haveamounted to 101,126 tons out of an estimated total of 703,000 tons in regularuse. In addition, the withdrawal of Swedish transport facilities has increased the enemy&apos;s need of ships of this class.Italian Merchant Shipping.26. According to the latest figures available about 80 Italian ships ofapproximately 210,000 tons in all are now in Allied hands in the Mediterranean.Of these, 11 of 60,000 tons are passenger ships, and include the hospital shipsToscana (9,442 tons) and Principessa Giovanna (8,955 tons); 13 of 58,000 tons aretankers; 16 of 61,000 tons are cargo ships of over 1,600 tons and 40 of 31,000 tons are smaller cargo ships. There are also ten other ships of unknown tonnage which have not yet been identified. These figures do not include naval auxiliaries(such as water-carriers) - or 12 miscellaneaus craft (sailing vessels, tugs andyachts); neither do they include three ships which were sunk in the ^Egeanafter they had come over to the Allies.MILITARY SITUATION,The Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map is included as an inset.)Vitebsk Sector.27.   The Russians have made a slight advance north-east of Vitebsk.Gomel-Kiev Sector.28. Local fighting has taken place in the Gomel area. In their bridge-headswest of the Dnieper the Russians have made little further progress, but they havebeen pinning down German forces by constant local attacks. They have succeeded in maintaining their communications across&quot;the Dnieper in spite of the regular air attacks to which the bridges and ferries have been subjected.Krivoi Rog Sector.29. The Germans have launched a number of strong counter-attacks in thearea of Krivoi Rog, and the Russians are held up a few miles north of the town.By these counter-attacks the Germans have kept open the line of retreat for theforces falling back from the Dnepropetrovsk area, and as a result of this german withdrawal the Russians have now captured a town 18 miles north-west ofNikopol.Lotver Dnieper-P erekop Sector.30. The rapid Russian advance which followed the capture of Melitppol onthe 23rd October has continued during the week. The capture of Perekop on the1st November cut the German land communications with the Crimea, and on thefollowing day Russian troops reached the east bank of the River Dnieper oppositeKachkarevka and Berislav, while others advanced along the Black Sea coast toa point 37 miles west of Perekop. Since breaking through in the Melitopol area the Russians have advanced at the rate of about 11 miles a day, which approachesthe maximum rate achieved by the Germans on the Eastern front in 1941and 1942.Crimea.31.   The Germans reported Russian landings on the 1st on both sides of thetown of Kerch, but these do not appear to have been made in any great strength.[26366] B 2
General:.32. There has been intermittent rain in South Russia but the roads are stillpassable, and the weather has not hindered operations. In general the russians have derived great advantage from the exceptionally dry autumn in South Russia.The number of divisions remaining in the Crimea is uncertain, but there maybe the equivalent of two German divisions plus something like five low-strengthRumanian divisions.Italy,(An outline map of the area of operations is included as an inset.)33. Heavy rain during the past week has added to the already considerable difficulties of terrain and communications which confront the Allied armies intheir advance in Italy. Nevertheless unremitting pressure has been kept up onthe Germans, and they have been forced to give more ground in their centre andon their right flank facing the Fifth Army. The enemy continues to contestevery vantage point as he falls back to his next main defensive positions along the rivers Sangro and Garigliano.Some 600 bridges have so far been destroyed in Italy by the Germans. Thishas put a severe strain on our bridging capacities, and to cope with the problemall unessential bridges constructed in North Africa, Sicily, and even in the i^earareas in Italy itself, are being dismantled and taken forward.34. Gn the Eighth Army right flank, after a period spent in patrolling and extending the bridgehead over the Trigno in the coastal area, our troops on the2nd secured another bridgehead over the river some 14 miles upstream. next day British troops attacked in strength across the river between the coast and themain road, and captured the town and railway station of San Salvo. On the left flank British infantry have made good progress and. at 0300 hours on the 4thoccupied the important communications centre of Isernia.35. By the 30th, u.s.. troops on the right flank of the Fifth Army, who hadbeen fighting their way across the western slopes of the Matese mountains, had captured the heights around Prata. The advance in this area threatened tooutflank the German positions on the coast in the region of Mount Massico.The enemy has accordingly been forced to make further withdrawals. By the3rd U.S. forces were three miles south of Isernia and within a similar distance of Venafro. British infantry captured Teano on the 31st and by the 3rd werein possession of Roccaminfina and approaching Sessa Aurunca. In the coastalsector, our armoured troops were temporarily held up at Monclragone by thewater-logged state of the ground. They are now, however, well forward of theMount Massico feature.TEgean.36. Since the 28th there have been no changes in enemy dispositions whichwould indicate any alteration in his intention to attack Leros and Samos.General Wilson has taken steps to invigorate the garrison of. Leros by insisting on the Italians appointing a more forceful commander of the 6,000Italian troops on the island. The new Italian commander will come directly under the orders of the British commander.Our garrisons on the islands have now been increased, and in Samos havebeen reinforced by the Greek Sacred Heart Squadron. A patrol from the LongRange Desert Group established itself on Naxos on the 30th. The island ofAmorgos was occupied by the Germans on the 29th.Burma.37. Normal patrol activity continues in the Arakan. It is reported that theJapanese have carried out reliefs of their forward troops in the Maungdaw area.In the Chin Hills there has been constant patrol activity on both sides..A company of our troops which attacked a Japanese position 20 miles south-east of Tiddim on the 25th met strong opposition, but inflicted a considerable numberof casualties on the enemy. Our own casualties are reported to amount to fivekilled and 18 wounded. In a small-scale advance the Japanese have reached apoint seven miles south-east of Falam.
Shingbwyang, at the north end of the Hukawng Y alley, has been occupied byChinese forces from Ledo, and contact was made with small parties of Japaneseon the 31st at Taro and Ningbyen.Chinese troops in the Burma-Yunnan border area continue to engage inguerrilla warfare against the Japanese. The Japanese have not crossed theSalween River in this area and the object of their operations seems to be the elimination of Chinese forces west of the river.New Guinea.38. In the Finschhafen area there has been only minor activity since therepulse of last week&apos;s Japanese counter-attack. The remnants of the Finsch-hafen garrison now appear to be moving north to join up with the Japanesewho were dispersed on the Rai Coast between Sio and Saidor, and have now movedeastwards (except for 1,500, who are mostly L. of C. troops) to the coast east ofSio. They are not, however, thought to have the resources to undertake a counter-offensive. Although Japanese air activity over Finschhafen and their determinedcounter-attacks on Australian positions indicate their concern at Allied occupa-tion of the Huon Peninsula, they are reported to have evacuated Long Island,which lies in the north-western entrance to the Vitiaz Strait between the HuonPeninsula and New Britain.In the Dumpu area active patrolling northwards continues.iSolomons.39. A fresh operation was launched in the Solomons on the night of the26th/27th, when elements of a New Zealand division landed on Mono (Treasury)Island, 40 miles south-east of Bougainville. Enemy mortar fire was silenced and opposition was apparently slight. Allied casualties were small. The NewZealand forces are reported to be well-established, although some oppositioncontinues.in the north-eastern part of the island.On the 28th, U.S. Marines landed, without opposition, on the west coast ofChoiseul, about 50 miles south of Choiseul Bay, where the Japanese are reportedto be concentrated for the purpose of evacuation. A second landing has been made about 18 miles south-east of Choiseul Bay. On the 30th, the U.S. forces attacked a large base in the Sangigai area, 27 miles north-west of Kakasa. There is no confirmation of press reports that parachute troops have been used in this operation.On the night of the 31st October/1st November, a further force of U.S.Marines was landed at Empress Augusta Bay on the west coast of BougainvilleIsland.   They are reported to have landedvwithout opposition.AIR SITUATION. *General Review.40. A heavy day attack by bombers of the U.S. VIIIth  Air Force was madeon Wilhelmshaven, and aircraft of Bomber Command operated in strengthagainst Dusseldorf.Heavy bombers, based on North Africa, made successful attacks on Genoaand aircraft factories at Wiener Neustadt.Escorted medium, bombers made an effective low-level attack on shipping atRabaul, and airfields on Bougainville Island were heavily bombed.United Kingdom.41. In daylight, no enemy aircraft were overland, but at dusk on the 1st,eight, of which six made only a shallow penetration, crossed the South Coast; twoof these enemy aircraft were destroyed.At night, raids over Eastern and South-Eastern England occurred on fournights; a total of 41 enemy aircraft, of which nine penetrated to the greater london area, was engaged in these operations. Mosquitoes destroyed three anda fourth crashed from unknown causes.Home Waters.42. In the early part of the week, a total of 50 aircraft from fighter command and the Tactical Air Force, with fighter escort, made five attacks onthe s.s. Munsterland in Cherbourg harbour; no hits are claimed.
In attacks on enemy shipping at sea, two small vessels were damaged off theBrest Peninsula and a third was damaged approaching Calais harbour.Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 128 sea mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.43. On the 3rd, the only day upon which weather permitted large scale operations, 565 heavy bombers of the U.S. VIIIth  Air Force&apos; were despatched to attack Wilhelmshaven. Of this force, 538 aircraft made a blind bombing attackthrough thick cloud and dropped 1,351 tons. &apos; No results could be observed andphotographic evidence is not yet available. Seven Fortresses (B. 17) were lost,but the bombers inflicted casualties on the enemy provisionally estimated at18 destroyed, 13 probably destroyed and 14 damaged. Twenty-five squadrons of Thunderbolts (P. 47) &quot;and Lightnings (P. 38) provided fighter support, andthese accounted for the destruction of a further 14 enemy aircraft plus fiveprobables and six damaged for the loss- of two Thunderbolts (P. 47).On the same day, three forces, each consisting of 72 Marauders (B. 26) with fighter escort, bombed airfields at St. Andre de L&apos;Eure, Tricqueville and Schipol(Amsterdam). About 120 tons of bombs were dropped on each target and fromall three attacks fair to good results are reported. Two Marauders (B. 26) anda Spitfire were lost; enemy casualties by the bombers and their fighter escortstotalled 14 enemy aircraft destroyed, three probably destroyed and four damaged.Escorted Typhoon bombers probably obtained two hits on a power station at Antwerp and, in another operation, in which the primary target was obscuredby cloud, damaged two R-boats and five barges near Le Havre.On the other six days of the week, operations were confined to three lightattacks on airfields at Guipavas (Brest), Maupertus (Cherbourg) and Lessay.Harassing operations against communications were also on a small scale andresulted&apos;in the destruction of nine enemy aircraft and three locomotives, and damage to 21 locomotives, two tugs, and seven barges for the loss of threeTyphoons.Night.44. On the night of the 3rd/4th, dusseldorf was the target for 589 aircraft of which about 90 per cent, attacked in good weather marred only by a slightground haze; 2,182 tons of bombs were dropped and a good concentration of bombing, with a tendency to spread towards the south-west of the town, is believed to have been achieved. Eighteen bombers failed to return and two crashed in thiscountry; four enemy night fighters were destroyed and seven more were damaged.A diversionary attack, in winch 248 tons were dropped, was made on Cologne.Mosquitoes made small-scale raids on Emden, Oberhausen, Cologne, Diissel-dorf, Dortmund and Rheinhausen (near Duisburg). Intruders of fighter command destroyed three enemy aircraft and bombed the shipbuilding yards atLe Trait.South of France.45. Thir-ty-eight Fortresses (B. 17) attacked the Antheor Viaduct nearSt. Raphael; 108 tons of bombs were dropped,&quot; two hits were made on the south-west end of the target, and possibly 12 hits on the north-east end. Other hits were obtained on tracks and the approaches. The viaduct is believed to have been rendered unserviceable by heavy damage.   Two bombers are missing.Austria.46. Eighty-six Fortresses (B. 17) and 53 Liberators (B. 24) were despatchedfrom Tunisia to bomb the Messerschmitt aircraft factory at Wiener Neustadt.At present, reports on the results of the attack are incomplete, but it is knownfrom photographs taken the next day, that extensive damage was done. one large assembly shop, two flight hangars, and the east end of the power station were destroyed. Many hits were seen amongst residential buildings. Fifty to 70enemy fighters were encountered., and it is reported that 30 were shot down. Nineheavy bombers are missing.
Italy.47. Enemy gun positions were subjected to heavy attacks by light and fighter-bombers, about 750 sorties being directed against these targets; someimplacements received direct hits and a number of guns were silenced. Inaddition, attacks were made on troops and M.T. vehicles; a considerable numberof the latter was either destroyed or damaged.Medium, light and fighter-bombers flew approximately 800 sorties against enemy road and rail communications. Two direct hits were obtained on the entrance to a tunnel near Antrodoco (50 miles N.E. of Rome). Thirty tons were dropped on a road block near Frosinone (44 miles E.S.E. of Rome). At Minturno,a bridge was destroyed east of the town and a pontoon bridge received a direct hit. A. train was set on fire at Celano. A number of other successful resultswas achieved, heavy damage being done to roads and railway tracks: Inaddition. Wellingtons made night attacks on the railway centre at Grosseto,where 58 tons were dropped, and the marshalling yards at Viareggio (20 miles N.of Leghorn).Mustangs (P. 51) machine-gunned grounded aircraft, 11 being damaged, inan area about 25 miles north-west of Rome; 41 enemy fighters were encountered,of which seven were destroyed. Invaders (A. 36) attacked the airfield at Aquino(70 miles S.E. of Rome) and at night Wellingtons dropped 35 tons on the airfield at Perugia (60 miles S.W. of Ancona).war hawks (P. 40F), carrying bombs, obtained two hits on two medium-sized ships at Giulianovo (25 miles N.N.W. of Pescara). Seventy-one Mitchells(B. 25) dropped a total of 104 tons of bombs on the docks at Civitavecchia andthe harbour at Anzio (28 miles S.E. of Rome). The same type of aircraft dropped66 tons on the harbour at Ancona, where a 5,000-ton ship was hit.Several attempts were made by heavy bombers (based on North Africa) toattack a ball-bearing factory at Turin. On each occasion bad weather com-pletely obscured the target. As an alternative, 133 Fortresses (B. 17) and20 Liberators (B. 24) dropped 405 tons of bombs on the railway centre at Genoa.Hits were made on the tracks, rolling stock, an instrument factory and theAnsaldo works. Savona, another alternative target, was bombed by26 Fortresses (B. 17), and hits were obtained on an iron and steel works andsulphur refineries. Other heavy bombers made small-scale attacks on Varazzo(two miles NW. of Savona), and the railway centre at Imperia (37 miles S.W.of Savona). &amp;Very little offensive activity by the enemy has been reported. It is notunusual for Allied bombers to meet with no opposition at all, as, for instance,during the raid on Genoa. Enemy close-support operations have been negligible,and tactical reconnaissance has been on vquite an inadequate scale. Over 30enemy bombers made an ineffective attack at night on the harbour at Naples;fighters shot down one Ju. 88 and A.A. probably destroyed another. during a defensive patrol over the western battle area, Spitfires encountered 13 Me. 109and destroyed five of these enemy fighters.Mediterranean.Dodecanese, Crete and Greece.48. Operations continued to be restricted by the unserviceability of landing grounds in Cyrenaica. Attacks were made on the airfields at Antimachia (Kos),Maritza (Rhodes), Heraklion (Crete) and in Greece on Secies and Megalo Mikra,at which latter airfields 19 enemy aircraft were either destroyed or damaged onthe ground.Baltimores (A. 30) sank an 80-ton caique south of Rhodes and attacked fiveothers anchored in Marmari Bay (Eubcea). Mitchells (B. 25), armed with 75-mm.guns, made several hits on small ships at Naxos and two F-boats at a jetty southof Kos harbour. Several other attacks were made on enemy ships but results were not seen. Three Baltimores (A. 30), despatched on a shipping search,are missing.Beaufighters, during shipping protection patrols, destooyed five Ju. 88 andone Arado 196, and prevented a number of enemy aircraft from making attacks.Dakotas (C. 47) dropped supplies to Allied forces on Leros and Samos.A total of about 85 enemy aircraft attacked Leros, Samos, Kastelorizo andPatmos; very little damage has been reported. The majority of these bombing-operations were escorted by small numbers of fighters. The importance which theenemy obviously attaches to an extension of control in the Eastern Mediterraneanindicates that the German Air Force&apos;s offensive effort in this area will bemaintained at least at its present level.
Yugoslavia and Albania.49. Thirty-six light and fighter-bombers attacked shipping in the harbour at Split; two Do. 24 were shot down. Thirty-five fighter-bombers attacked foursmall motor-boats at the mouth of the river Neretvica (N. Yugoslavia), and asmall tanker, which was probably destroyed, in the approaches to Split harbour.Thirty-two Lightnings (P. 38) effectively attacked the airfield at Tirana;two Me. 109 were shot down.Russia.50. Russian air activity has been chiefly concentrated in the area of theRussian advance to Perekop, where day and night attacks have been made ontroop concentrations and lines of communication. Much damage has been done to rolling-stock and M.T., and many casualties inflicted on the retreating german forces. In the area north of Krivoi Rog, the Russian Air Force has been engagedin close-support operations, and claim to have shot down 76 enemy aircraft.Elsewhere the Russians make little mention of air activity, except in the north,where small-scale anti-shipping successes are claimed.Burma.51. In the north, Allied aircraft attacked the airfield at Myitkyina and villages in the vicinity; the approaches to the railway bridge at Namkwin(56 miles S.W. of Myitkyina) were damaged and three hits were made on a bridgenear Mogaung.   Invaders (A. 36) operated in support of our land forces at Taro.In the Upper Chindwin and Mytttha Valley, fighters and fighter-bombersraided enemy positions and villages, and 21 Liberators (B. 24) attacked the town of Kalewa.Near Katha, 20 Mitchells (B. 25) effectively attacked a railway bridge atMeza,In the Mandalay area, a total of 121 heavy and medium bombers made12 raids on railway and other targets; a railway bridge over the Mu River, about30 miles S.W. of Mandalay, was hit.
