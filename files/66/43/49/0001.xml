Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1943.The circulation of this paper lias been strictly limited. It is issued for m personal use c I -^r^^^I..........................MOST secret.P. (43) 549.2nd December, 1943WAR CABINET.PRODUCTION OF NEW TYPE LANDING SHIPS AND OTHER-CHANGES IN NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME,  1943.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE requirements put forward by the Joint Planning Staff and approvedby the Chiefs of Staff for Landing Ships and Craft up to April 1945, include a new and faster type of tank landing ship (L.S.T. 3). Approval is sought toplace orders now for the first 80 ships to complete by the 1st April, 1945.Forty-two are needed by the 1st September, 1944, and 38 from that date until the1st April, 1945. A wastage replacement programme of 6 per month thereafteris envisaged.2. These ships are intended for Far Eastern operations and are particularlydesired by- Admiral Mountbatten. A particular feature df these operations isthat the ships concerned are required to steam long distances.3. For operations involving such long-distance steaming, a good speed isspecially desirable for the following reasons : (a) L.S.T. can be included in the Assault Convoy.   This strengthens the assault, economises escorts and much reduces the danger of disasterfrom mis-timing separate approaches to the Assault.(b) The chance of surprise is increased by a rapid approach by all Assaultunits.(c) Greater security is achieved since less time is spent in the danger zoneclose to hostile coasts.(d) The effect of navigational errors on timing of the Assault is reduced.(e) Greater strategical and tactical flexibility is obtained in the event ofa change of plan at a late stage.if) Shorter total time is spent on passage and consequent better state ofboth personnel (sea-sickness) and material on arrival.(g) The direct effect of bad weather on timing of the operation is much reduced; the slower L.S.T. is likely to lose more speed both actuallyand proportionately.Note. In the recent Mediterranean operations the L.S.T. 2 was acceptablebecause of the very much shorter distances involved and the likelihood of very good weather.4. It is understood that the United States do not consider they can altertheir design now and will not build the L.S.T. (3); they expect us to make someappreciable contribution to the requirements of Landing Ships from our own production.5. As a result of a recent review of Escort Vessel requirements, and in viewalso of the man-power shortage, it has been decided to reduce the Escort Vesseltarget requirement by some 200 ships. This will free a certain amount ofshipyard capacity in this country throughout 1944, which could be used to buildthese L.S.T. 3&apos;s. It is estimated that m this way perhaps 45 L.S.T. 3&apos;s couldbe produced by the 1st April, 1945, and an endeavour would be made to obtain from Canada the remaining 35 required by that date.[2652-1]
6. So far as can at present be foreseen, the other tonnage actually displacedby the 45 L.S.T. 3&quot;s would be 25,000 tons of merchant-ship construction in 1944and 35,000 in 1945.7. As the programme of L.S.T. 3 is a Large one (80 ships by the 1st April,1945, and thereafter at the rate of 72 a year), I seek the approval of the WarCabinet before placing any orders. - At this stage I ask authority only for thefirst 80 ships. It is impossible at present to give a firm estimate of the cost, asthe design is not yet finally settled, but I propose to set the figure, verv roughly,at  500,000 per vessel, i.e.,  40.000,000 for the first 80.8. I take this opportunity of reporting to the Cabinet a number of relatively small changes that have been made in the 1943 New Construction programme with the sanction of the Treasury.   These are : (a) Substitution of 6 &quot; A&quot; class for 10 &quot; U &quot; class  submarines.    The&quot; A &quot; class are large submarines suitable for operations in the far east for which the &quot; U   class would have insufficient endurance.(b) The addition, to ensure continuity of production at peak rates, of thefollowing Landing Craft : 150 Landing Craft. Mechanised (Mark I).90 Landing Craft, Gun (Medium).160 Landing Craft, Tank.360 Landing Craft, Assault..30 Landing Craft. Support (Medium).In addition, the Defence Committee (Supply) have decided that75 more Landing Craft. Tank, should be produced by the 1st May,1944.  The financial effect of these changes is shown in the Table.  annexed hereto.A. V. A..4 dm iral ty, S. W.&apos; 1.2nd December, 1943.Amendments to 1943 New Construction Programme.Vessels.
