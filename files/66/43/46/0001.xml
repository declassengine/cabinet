THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERiPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 194-3.The circulation of this paper has beer? strictly limited. It is isstaeafor the personal issg of.........JMAN-POWER FOR THE ROYAL AIR FORGE IN 1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE Air Ministry Is original man-power demand for 1944 on the basis ofthe current expansion programme was 142,000 men and women (W.P. (43) 425).It is calculated that if the demand were reduced to 80,000 men and women-and provided that the 1943 allocation is met in full the planned programmed could be continued until the autumn of 1945, but no longer.2. The Ministerial Committee have recommended an allocation of 50,000men for the whole of 1944, and 10,000 women for the first half of 1944. On theassumption that when the position is reviewed next May a further substantialallocation of women is made for the second half of 1944, I am prepared to accept this as sufficiently approximating to the requirement.3. I agree with the view that, as well as providing a measure of insurance for the Royal Air Force against the risk of Germany not being defeated beforethe end of 1944, it would also be prudent to insure the Navy against &quot; the risk that Germany will be defeated in 1944,&quot; and that large carrier-borne forces would have to be sent against Japan as early as possible in 1945. I am accordinglyready to implement the recommendation of the Ministerial Committee that the&quot;Admiralty and the Air Ministry should arrange that out of the proposed allocation for the R.A.F., up to 17,000 men should be trained in 1944 in such away that they could be used in 1945 either in the Royal Air Force or in the fleet air Arm.&quot;4. The First Lord sug;gests that the men required should be diverted to theNavy to receive Naval air training, and that if Germany were not defeated in1944, they should be lent to the R.A.F. for the duration of the war in Europe.He bases this proposal on the assumption that it would be simpler and quickerfor the R.A.F. to absorb a comparatively small number of trained Fleet Air Armpersonnel into existing squadrons than for the reverse process to take place.5. I do not believe this would be the case. The continuing expansion of theR.A.F. is now confined wholly to Heavy Bomber Squadrons, and the proposed allocation of 50,000 men will be required almost entirely to make good^wastageof Heavy Bomber crews in 1945 the needs of expansion being met from menalready in the Service. Thus, if the war with Germany continues beyond 1944,the impact of Bomber Command upon the enemy would be diminished at what will certainly be a critical period unless wastage can be made good by the supplyof aircrews fully trained to the high and extremely specialised standards of bomber Comm,and.6. If the responsibility for providing for R.A.F. needs in this event lay with, the Navy, they would have to supply at the end of 1944 and during theearly months of 1945 17,000 men, all of whom would have to be aircrew andmost of them already trained to the standard of Bomber Command. I do not know whether the Fleet Air Arm could produce this number of aircrew at short notice, but in any case they could not provide the specialised categories required.[26498]I OMOST SECRET    - . .

7. There are seven members of a heavy bomber crew; pilot, navigator, airbomber, flight engineer, wireless operator/air gunner, and two air gunners. Thetraining of a heavy bomber pilot differs widely from that of a Fleet Air Armpilot; there are no air bombers or flight engineers in the Fleet Air Arm, nor are there any air gunners trained in the use of power-operated turrets.8. It would therefore be quite impossible for R.A.F. requirements in 1945,if the war with Germany is still continuing, to be made good from the resourcesof the Fleet Air Arm.9. On the other hand, in relation to the numbers of suitable men which couldbe provided from the R.A.F., the Fleet Air Arm requirement is very small.Moreover, it is understood that a substantial proportion of this number wouldbe unskilled men, and, of the remainder, the proportion of aircrew would belower than that of skilled or semi-skilled maintenance personnel.10. Towards the end of 1944, the strength of the Royal Air Force will be approximately a million men. From this number, as soon as an Armistice issigned with Germany, I should hope to be able to arrange for the admiralty to select the men they require. Every man so selected could have had operationalexperience, and the maintenance personnel would have been employed on highly skilled duties. The bulk of the aircrews would in any case be operationallyexperienced. Some of the single-engined pilots might have had previous deck-landing experience; the twin-engined pilots and all the other aircrew categoriescould largely be found from men who had served in the war at sea in coastal command.11. I recognise, of course, that few would have received basic seatraining but the syllabus, I understand, is short and that the skilled groundpersonnel and aircrews would require a short period to become familiarised withthe special methods and equipment of the Fleet Air Arm.12.-&apos; Accordingly, if the proposal were that the R.A.F. should be asked toprovide an insurance for the Navy, I believe that entirely suitable practicalarrangements could be worked out.A.
