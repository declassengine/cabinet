Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 531.23rd November, 1943.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER FOR THE COAL-MINING INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.1. If we are to secure our essential requirements of coal, it is urgently necessary that the labour force in the coal-mining industry should be raised to720.000 and maintained at that level.The Lord President&apos;s Committee approved in August plans for increasingthe labour force of the industry by voluntary means; but it was then contemplated that, if these failed to achieve their purpose, compulsory methods would haveto be applied.. The campaign for volunteers has been given a fair trial, and it isnow clear that it will not yield sufficient results.The Minister of Labour and National Service is satisfied that the numbers required cannot be obtained except by calling-up compulsorily to the coal minesfit men of military age who would otherwise be called up for the Armed Forces;and the Minister of Fuel and Power made an announcement to this effect in theHouse of Commons on the 12th October (Official Report, column 765).2. The main difficulty in applying compulsion is that it must be selective.Only a small proportion of those due to be called up for military service need be drafted into the mines; and the basis of selecting these must be such as to winpublic confidence in its impartiality. The Minister of Labour and NationalService, after considering all possible alternatives, has come to the conclusion thatthe selection must be made by ballot. .3. It is therefore proposed that the numbers required for the coal mines should be selected by ballot from among men between the ages of 18 and 25 whoare available for calling up to the Armed Forces and are placed in a medical gradeacceptable for underground coal-mining. The field of selection ought, on grounds of fairness, to be as wide as possible; and it is therefore proposed to exclude fromthe ballot only men who have been accepted for flying duties in the R.A.F. and theFleet Air Arm, or as artificers in submarines, and men in a. short list of highly skilled occupations who are only allowed to enter certain Service trades and, under existing arrangements, are not allowed to volunteer for coal-mining. It is not considered possible to exclude from the ballot men who have been members of the senior and Junior Training Corps, Army Cadets, Sea Cadets, Air TrainingCorps or Home Guard.All the men from whom this selection is made will already,dy have beenmedically examined and placed in a high medical grade. There may, however, berare cases of men within those medical grades who, for special reasons, areunsuitable for underground work; and arrangements will be made for a secondmedical examination of any who, on being selected for coal-mining, claim to besuffering from some special disability which unfits them for this kind of work.4. It is Likely that some men who were content to be called up for militaryservice will seek to show reasons, other than medical reasons, why they should notbe drafted into coal-mining. If the impartiality of the scheme is to be main-tained, it will be necessary to reject automatically claims by employers that a manis indispensable in the industry in which he is already,,at work, and claims that aman has special talents for the Armed Forces which would be wasted in thecoal mines. It will, however, be necessary to provide for.appeal in cases ofspecial hardship so that, for example, a man who is suddenly fate,]  with[26460]
serious domestic difficulties can apply for a certificate of postponement. In sucheases, men. selected for coal-mining will therefore be given an opportunity ofappealing to a Local Appeal Board, who will be empowered to make recom-mendations on the two questions : (a) Whether, since the proper time for making a hardship claim, any new circumstances have arisen constituting hardship justifying postpone-ment; and(b) Whether there are special circumstances which make employment in coal-mining an exceptional hardship.The standards applied by these Boards will be comparable to those applied in granting postponement of military service.&apos;5. The men selected by these means will be directed, in the first instance, toa course of four weeks&apos; training at a training centre established or approvedby the Ministry of Labour and National Service. Men living in or near a coal-field will, as far as possible, be trained for employment in that coalfield; otherswill be trained for employment in the area wdrere their services are mostrequired. Individual preferences will be taken into account as far as possible.This preliminary course of training will be supplemented by further training at the colleries at which the men are placed for employment.6. The Lord President&apos;s Committee have endorsed the proposals of theMinister of Labour and National Service, which are outlined above; and theyinvite the War Cabinet to give early approval to the scheme so that it can beput into operation in December.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,23rd November, 1943.
