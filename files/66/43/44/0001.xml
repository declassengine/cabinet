FOR FORT-NIGHT ENDING 1200 HOURS, SUNDAY, 21 st NOVEMBER, 1943.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.OPERATIONS were restricted by fog at bases and cloud conditions over germany. A heavy attack was, however, made on Berlin; Mannheim/Ludwigshafen, Leverkusen and the marshalling yards at Modane and Canneswere also raided.Summary of Operations.Target.Modane railway centre  ...Cannes railway centreAntheor    viaduct    and    railway bridge  ...Mannheim/Ludwigshafen.Mannheim/Ludwigshafen...Berlin ...       ...       ...       ..:Leverkusen ...In addition 170 aircraft were despatched on small harassing raids on german towns (Berlin among them) and 324 mines were laid.Operations.Modane (10th/11th November).Reports and night plots show, that this attack, carried out in cloudlessweather and with good visibility/achieved a very high degree of concentration.Day cover has not yet been obtained but reports from ground sources show thatsevere damage was done to the railway centre. A German troop train is said tohave been hit.Cannes (11th/12th November).Weather was excellent over the target and a Very good concentration isshown on the night plots. Day cover is awaited to confirm results. A small forceof specially equipped Lancasters also attacked the Antheor viaduct and thebridge at Agay. The aircraft landed in Africa and no day photographs are yet available to assess the success of these attacks.Mannheim j Ludwigshafen (17th/18th, 18th/19th November).Reports of the first attack indicated that a good concentration had been achieved. Plots of night photographs taken through breaks in the cloud presentan inconclusive picture, and although it is clear that a number of aircraft bombed the target (the I. G. Farben Works) no results are yet established. Night plotsindicated that in the second attack bombing was scattered to the east of thetown, but until day cover is obtained no definite estimate can be given of thesuccess of either of these attacks.Berlin (18th/19th November).Weather was unfavourable for this attack and it is improbable that any greatconcentration was achieved.   No photographs have vet been obtained.   German[26492]aircraft date. Despatched.10/11 November 31311/12      ,, 13411/12      ,, 1017/18 8318/19 39518/19      ,, 44419/20 266
communiques and reports in the neutral press suggest that considerable damage was caused over a wide area in the south part of the city.Leverkusen (19th/20th November).It is not expected that a concentrated attack was achieved in this raid onthe I.G. Farben Works at Leverkusen, but no night or day photographs have yetbeen obtained.Results of Previous Raids.dusseldorf.Final assessment of photographs taken after the attack on the 3rd/4thNovember shows that more than a quarter of the small remainder of the fullybuilt-up city area has now been destroyed, and buildings repaired since the pre-vious attacks have again been damaged. 15 per cent, of the surviving suburbanhousing has also been made useless. Four high priority steel and armament works and 17 other important factories were damaged, and renewed dislocation has been caused to railway transport.Prints Nos. 1 and 2 show some of the damage caused.4Leipzig.Photographs taken after the attack on the 20th/21st October show damagemainly in the central part of the town.   Industrial concerns affected include Schumann Findeison u. Co. (builders&apos; machinery).Paul Schubert (chemical goods).Rothenstein Accumulator A.G.Richter Schirmer u. Co. (gas meter).Aktienbierbrauerei Gehlis (brewer).Several hits are seen on railway premises. A number of warehouses and goods transfer sheds are destroyed; a large workmen&apos;s barracks adjacent to an aircraft fuselage w7orks has been completely demolished, and three unidentifiedfactories and an unidentified commercial building have been damaged.M ontlucon.Further confirmation has been received of the destruction of the DunlopWorks at Montlueon by the attack on the 15th/16th September. It is now known that although the works themselves were completely devastated by fire and H.E.,and three quarters of the workers&apos; houses destroyed, casualties to personnel were very light. Very little damage was done to the town of Montlucon or to any property outside the actual target area.General.The vast damage to housing caused by bombing attacks in 1943 is indicated by the following report which has been received from ground sources. On the31st March, 1943, it was estimated that 378,000 houses had been destroyed. by the 30th June this figure rose to 920,000 and by the 30th September to 1,605,000.On this basis it cannot now be much below 2,0(30,000.A report has been received which gives some indication of the damage caused to locomotives and rolling-stock in the course of the attacks on town areas.
