(43) 155th Conclusions, Minute 2), I read to my colleagues certain extracts from the Minutes of a meeting of-the Middle East Defence Committee, at whichthe policy of Flis Majesty&apos;s Government towards Greece had been considered. Tnow circulate these minutes (Annex A) for the consideration of my colleagues,together with the memorandum by the Minister of State Resident in the middle east (Annex B), which was considered at the meeting in question.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,&apos; 17th November, 1943.&apos;   ANNEX A,Extract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Middle East DefenceCommittee held on 7th November, 1943 (D.C. (43) 26th Meeting).1. Minutes of Previous Meetings.(D.C. (43) 24th and 25th Meetings.)THE COMMITTEE approved the Minutes of their meetings held on the30th October and the 5th November, 1943.2. Politico-Military Situation in Greece.THE COMMITTEE had before them two messages from Damaskinos, Arch-bishop of Athens, proposing certain action to forestall any attempt by theGermans to carry out extensive demolitions in Athens, and any attempt by theKAM at a coup d&apos;Etat.SIR I!. MAITLAND WILSON said that the majority Of the organisationsnominated by the Archbishop had in fact not come out in the open until itappeared certain to them that the Germans were going to lose the war. he considered, however, that they might be strengthened by sending in represenativesof the Greek Government.Mr. LEEPER said that he had spoken to the King of the Hellenes and to theGreek President of the Council about this, but in view of the failure of the GreekGovernment to appreciate the need for security, and in view of the delicateposition of Damaskinos, he had restricted his discussions to these two individuals.Many of the organisations, according to his information, had held back in the[26436] &apos; b
past in order to avoid reprisals by the Germans, but it had always been their intention to act when they judged Allied occupation to be imminent. Hesuggested that he should take the matter up further with M. Tsouderos and should&quot;propose that one or two trustworthy Greek officers should be sent in to make contact with Damaskinos and the organisations nominated by him. further action would depend on the report made by these officers.THE COMMITTEE :-Endorsed the suggestion at &quot; X&quot; above and invited Mr. keeper to put it into effect.3. British policy towards Greece.THE COMMITTEE had before them a Memorandum by the Minister ofState (Annex B) setting out the respective views of the British Embassy to greece and the Services on British policy towards Greece, with particular reference to theattitude to be adopted towards E AM/EL AS, and pointing out that these viewsappeared to be incapable of reconciliation locally.Me. EDEN said that he had come to certain provisional conclusions on thismatter. In his view the immediate military advantages which might accrue fromcontinued support of EAM/ELAS were outweighed by the political disadvan-tages which would certainly accrue in the not far distant future. We should be doing a great disservice to Greece herself by continuing to build up EAM/ELAS,and, moreover, we needed a friendly Greece baclly ourselves. It would be most fortunate if, as a result of our own action, Greece were in future to be governed by EAM. The Russians had stated definitely at Moscow that they had no interestin, or contact with, Greece, which they apparently regarded as within our sphere of influence, but this attitude might be expected to change if EAM gained control in Greece. Of greater immediate importance, however, was the probable effecton the present Greek Government if we continue to back EAM/ELAS. Theywould probably resign and we should be left with a number of important and difficult political problems on our hands not the least of which would be thequestion to whom the Greek Navy and Merchant Marine were then responsible.This would be the first occasion on which we had pursued a policy in respect ofan enemy-occupied country which was contrary to the wishes of its free Govern-ment. The blackmail which EAM/ELAS hoped to extract from us was risingsteadily, and he viewed their whole-hearted co-operation with us in the future as improbable. In his opinion, therefore, the immediate military advantages of continuing to support EAM/ELAS were outweighed by the short-term, as wellas the long-term, political disadvantages. It should, he felt, be possible todiscredit EAM/ELAS and to build up an organisation in the EL AS areas whichwould provide the safe harbour facilities required by the Services. He might feeldifferently if military operations in Greece were to be undertaken in the nearfuture, but in existing circumstances he considered it most unwise to supportEAM/ELAS. A break with EAM/ELAS would mean cutting off supplies ofarms, withdrawing British Liaison Officers and denouncing the EAM/ELASleaders. If an immediate break with EAM/ELAS were not possible without endangering the lives of BLOs, it should be possible for P.W.E. at least to under-mine the position of the EAM/ELAS leaders without risk to the BLOs. Thewithdrawal to.Cairo of the BLOs from EAM/ELAS should make it possible toreach an objective conclusion on the facts of the situation, on which at presentconflicting views were held. He proposed to recommend to the War Cabinet thatcontinuance of the present policy was politically dangerous and that we should aim at breaking with, or undermining the influence of, the EAM/ELAS leaders and at seducing their followers. As regards the return of Brigadier Myers to greece, he felt that negotiations with EAM/ELAS could only lead, as in thepast, to promises which would prove most inconvenient.SIR II. MAITLAND WILSON said that the effect on the war of failing tosupport EAM/ELAS would be considerable. A break with them would mean the withdrawal of safe harbour facilities from BLOs, making it necessary towithdraw the BLOs themselves. It would no longer be possible to cut enemy communications or attack enemy airfields in ELAS areas. It would also mean that a British corps would be required to wrest control from EAM/ELASultimately, instead of merely a division if the present policy were continued,since with the present policy he considered that EAM/ELAS would probablydisintegrate when the British arrived.   They had been told that no further arms
would be supplied for the present. They had recently acquired the arms andequipment of an Italian division. . Further supplies would result in the armingof ian untrained rabble. Should it be necessary to evacuate the BLOs, he considered that this could be done in a month. Fie suggested that if BrigadierMyers were sent back to Greece for a month he could at least contact the EAM/ELAS leaders and discover whether they were as black as the existing evidencepainted them.THE MINISTER OF STATE observed that many EAM/ELAS supportershad been led to believe that we intended to secure the return of the King by force.Most EAM/ELAS supporters were not left-wing in&apos; outlook, but would supportthe left-wing elements to prevent the return of the King. The first essential,therefore, was to make it quite clear to the moderates that we had no intentionof forcing the King on them. If we could let it be known that the King did not propose to return, unless invited, to do so by his people, many EAM/ELASsupporters would come over to our side. A fair statement of our difficulties mightwell persuade the King to act as we wished over this. It would be considerablyeasier for the War Cabinet to decide on policy if the King could be induced toadopt our views. He suggested that Mr. Leeper should make an immediate effort to persuade the King accordingly.Mr. LEEPER observed that from his previous discussion with the foreign secretary the King had understood that no declaration was required of him atpresent. Fie had, however, recently made a conciliatory reply to his Ministerswhen they had pressed him to state that he would not return to Greece unlessinvited to do so by his people. EAM/ELAS had made great propaganda capitalout of the alleged present attitude of the King and his Government and of theBritish. If he were fully informed of the present situation in Greece and of thedifficulties we were facing, and if he were told that such a statement by him atthis juncture would be a, great asset both to us and to himself, this might havea considerable effect on him. Such a statement would also make it easier for theGreek Government to co-operate with the National Bands in Greece.SIR H. MAITLAND WILSON agreed with the Minister of State andMr. Leeper, and suggested that a declaration by the King would be a goodfoundation on which to wean EAM/ELAS followers from their leaders.Mr. LEEPER pointed out that the declaration would need to be accompaniedby a breach with EAM/ELAS, since if it were put forward as merely a first stepit would be construed as the result of EAM/ELAS pressure. Moreover, he considered it would only be possible to persuade the King to make a statementif he were assured that, as a quid pro quo, a breach with EAM/ELAS wouldaccompany the statement.   It was a question of timing.Mr. VELLACOTT agreed that the King&apos;s statement would be likely to do more harm than good unless followed immediately by a breach with EAM/ELAS.He agreed that a- statement was desirable, since from the political warfareviewpoint the position of the King was at present the great obstacle, and astatement by him would isolate the EAM/ELAS leaders, who were now usinghim as a stalking horse for their own political aims. He added that he was in need of effective factual support for his propaganda and suggested that, to meet this.need, more Greek-speaiking British officers should be sent in, not as liaison officers, but as leaders of the dissident ELAS.Mr. LEEPER suggested that, as the King was at present in a difficult mood,he should be invited to pay a short visit to London to discuss the matter of hisdeclaration with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary. This would avoid the inevitable delay wdiich would result from the use of diplomatic methods.Referring to the BLOs, he considered that action should not wait until it proved possible to evacuate them since, when the intention to evacuate them became known, they would be held as prisoners and delays and obstructions would ensue.It might be better, relying on the predominant anglophile sentiment in Greece,that the Commander-in-Chief should instruct them to remain at their posts,ih the confidence that the Greek people would not harm them. This was a gambleworth taking on the strength of the sensitive reaction of EAM/ELA.S to the murder of Lieut. Hubbard. Delay must be avoided, since the EAM/ELASclandestine newspapers were conducting most vigorous propaganda againstZervas, the King and the Greek Government and were sowing suspicion ofthe British in the minds of their followers.Izutouj B Z
He considered that the correct policy would be :  I (i) To bring the King into full consultation and lay the facts of thesituation  before  him  admitting  past  mistakes a  joint  meeting between the King, the Commander-in-Chief, M.E.F., and himself would be desirable at an early stage,(ii) Subject to (iv) below, to persuade the  King that it was in his own interests and in the interests of Greece that he should make animmediate declaration to the effect that he did not intend to returnto Greece until specifically invited to do so by the Greek people.,,^,,(iii) If necessary, to encourage the King to pay a short visit to London to consult with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary,(iv) Coincident with the King&apos;s declaration, to break with EAM/ELAS,either gradually or abruptly as the situation at the time demanded,and to work for the formation in ELAS areas of non-political.National Bands.(v) Dependent on the successful outcome of the above, to work in close co-operation with the Greek Government on matters affectingoperations in Greece and to treat the resulting effort as an anglo-Greek effort.He pointed out the value of the presence of Greek troops in Samos, which had contributed materially towards close co-operation between the Greek Governmentand the local Government of Samos.He added that he could expect no success whatever with the King ifBrigadier&apos;Myers were allowed to return to Greece.SIR H. MAITLAND WILSON expressed the hope that no abrupt break with EAM/ELAS would prove necessary. He considered that, once the.questionof the King was clarified, it should be possible to build up an Anglo-Greekorganisation on the basis of the existing structure, without breaking withEAM/ELAS. Objective propaganda on the present lines, suitably strengthened,should be sufficient to discredit the EAM/ELAS leaders in the eyes of their followers. If our disengagement from EAM/ELAS were gradual, and the Kingmade the statement we desired, it would be unnecessary to evacuate the BLOsand the military effort would not suffer appreciably.Mr. VELLACOTT said that the present propaganda could be strengthenedslightly, but a full campaign w^ould be impossible until a Cabinet decision on policy had been made. Even then, however precise the instructions laid down,the effect inside Greece would be negligible unless the question of the King were first settled satisfactorily.THE COMMITTEE-(a) Invited the Foreign Secretary, when putting his policy towards Greecebefore the War Cabinet, to take into account the Minister of StateResident in the Middle East&apos;s Memorandum and the above discussion,particularly the suggestions at &quot; X &quot; above.(b) Invited Mr. Leeper, pending a War Cabinet decision on the policy to beadopted towards Greece, to initiate immediate discussions with theKing of the Hellenes on the basis of &quot; X above. [This was subse-quently suspended.](c) Agreed that in view of the large stock of arms, ammunition and. equip-ment recently obtained by EAM/ELAS through the disarming of an italian division, S.O.E. should continue indefinitely the presentsuspension of the supply of arms and ammunition to EAM/ELASexcept in the Eastern Macedonia area.(d) Agreed that for the present no steps should be taken to withdraw Britishliaison officers from ELAS areas in Greece.(e) Invited Mr. Vellacott to intensify, as far as possible, his present campaign of objective propaganda in Greece on the lines already agreed.(/) Agreed that Brigadier Myers should not return to Greece and that colonel Woodhouse should, be designated as Head of the allied military Mission in Greece.
5tj annex B.BRITISH POLICY TOWARDS GREECE.Memorandum by the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East.A. Introduction.1. In recent months there has developed in the Middle East an apparentlyirreconcileable conflict between the interests of long-term strategy, as expressedin the policy of the Foreign Office towards Greece, and the interests of short-termstrategy, as expressed in the operational policy of the fighting services, carriedout by S.O.E. inside Greece. These conflicting policies are summarised in the ensuing paragraphs.- B. The Political Aspect.Background.2. British long-term interests require that there shall be established1 an.Greece, after the war, a stable and friendly Government. This must be basedon moderate Republican opinion in Greece, which is predominant, and which isactively represented at present by the guerrilla bands known as EDES, underZervas, It is believed also that over 50 per cent, of the rank and file of theguerrilla bands known as ELAS are moderate Republican in outlook. Animportant feature of the moderate Republican outlook at present is that it isAnglophile.3. The second main current of opinion in Greece is extremely Left inoutlook and is represented politically by an organisation known as EAM andin the military sphere by the ELAS guerrilla bands, whose leaders (as distinct from the rank and file) are extreme Left and obey the orders of EAM. for practical purposes, in fact, there is no distinction between EAM and ELAS.4. Zervas has been consistently loyal to the British Government, and inparticular has at all times carried out the orders of C.-in-C, M.E.F., even in circumstances of the greatest difficulty. While not in favour of the return ofthe King to Greece, he is content with the assurance that the form of the future government of Greece will be determined by the will of the Greek people, freelyexpressed. He is willing to co-operate with the present Greek Government, every member of which wholeheartedly supports him. Fie disposes of about 5,000 armedguerrillas, and his particular sphere of. influence lies West of the PindusMountains.5. EAM/ELAS have co-operated with the British in military operations in the past. More recently, however, it has become clear that this co-operationhas aimed mainly at securing sufficient arms to enable them to predominate in greece. Their object is to liquidate other guerrilla bands and to establish in greece a Dictatorship of the Left. Their hold on their followers is exercisedmainly by force and through fear. They have attacked EDES bands recently-it is suspected, in collusion with the Germans. Recently also they have initiateda distorted and virulent propaganda campaign with the object of discreditingZervas, the King and the Greek Government. The tone of their propaganda is.becoming increasingly anti-British, especially in the Peloponnese and Athens.British Liaison Officers with ELAS bands have latterly suffered indignities and violence, are in some cases virtually under open arrest, and one New Zealandofficer (Lieut. Flubbard) has even been murdered. EAM is now openly floutingthe authority of the C.-in-C, M.E.F. In contradistinction to Zervas,EAM/ELAS have proved themselves thoroughly unreliable, and have made itapparent that if they predominate there can be no stable or pro-British govern-ment in Greece. They dispose at present of some 15,000 armed guerrillas, andpredominate East of the Pindus Mountains and in the Peloponnese. They haverecently had a considerable accretion of arms from Italians whom they havedisarmed in contravention of an agreement which they themselves, together withthe Chief British Liaison Officer, signed. Their present military value to theBritish cause is stated by several British Liaison Officers to be virtually nil.[26436] b 3
Policy.6.   I believe the Foreign Secretary&apos;s policy to be as under :-(a) To destroy the power of EAM and the ELAS leaders.(b) To build up throughout Greece the EDES bands under Zervas or, if hecan be brought from France, Plastiras, a well-known public figure in greece.(c) To build up in Athens a Regency Committee under the Archbishop,Damaskinos, which may be able to forestall the efforts of EAM to seizepower in the capital when the time comes.(d) To link  Zervas  and  Damaskinos  with  the  King and  the  GreekGovernment in Cairo.(e) To persuade the King that it is in his own and the national interest.. that he should postpone his return to Greece until he is specificallyinvited to return by his people.Need for P ropaganda Campaign.7. As a first step towards carrying out the aims in paragraph 6 (a) and (&amp;),the British Embassy to Greece considers that an immediate and intensivepropaganda campaign must be directed against EAM and the ELAS leaders,and in favour of Zervas. Not only is this&quot; necessary as a counter-measure tothe anti-British propaganda of EAM (which cannot be taken lying down ifpro-British sentiment is to survive in Greece), but it should also have the effectof discrediting EAM and the ELAS leaders in the eyes of the majority of their followers and so cause the desertion of large numbers of ELAS to Zervas, or theformation of moderate Republican groups sympathetic to Zervas within theELAS bands. It is believed that an all-out campaign will produce a rapid changein the present unsatisfactory situation. In the view of the British Embassy to greece, EAM have issued a challenge which must be taken up if we are to have any influence on Greek affairs in the future. Moreover, the pursuit of the aims in paragraph 6 (&amp;), (c), (d) and (e) would not get anywhere unless and until thepower of EAM is first destroyed.Effect of Propaganda on Military Value of Guerrillas.8. So far from weakening the potential of the Greek guerrillas to harassthe Germans, the British Embassy to Greece hold that the steps proposed would strengthen it. Hitherto the sole military value of ELAS bands, apart from minorsabotage activities and ambushes of no real importance, has been to provide safe-harbour facilities for British sabotage parties. If EAM&apos;s anti-British propa-ganda is allowed to go unchecked, British parties will very soon be unable to operate in ELAS areas. Even if this propaganda dies down and there is no evidence that it will do so it is extremely unlikely that EAM will permit Britishparties to operate from ELAS areas except on their own conditions, which will certainly include the further supply of arms with which to consolidate their holdon Greece. The minimum of active assistance can be expected. On the otherhand, there is a good prospect that the discrediting of EAM and the ELASleaders will result in the formation, in ELAS areas, of moderate bands, in sympathy with Zervas, who will not only continue to offer safe-harbour to BLOsbut, in addition, will allow them freedom of movement and assistance in theirsabotage w-ork, and will play a willing and prominent part in harassing theGermans.Position of British Liaison Officers.9. The British Embassy to Greece believe it to be unlikely that the full useof propaganda by the British would jeopardise the lives of BLOs in Greece.ELAS have done everything possible to hush up the murder of only one BLO.They will not dare to take extreme action until, by their own propaganda,, theyhave eliminated pro-British sentiment in Greece. Bold and confident british propaganda, based on the conviction that all Greeks are Anglophile, is the best way of safeguarding the BLOs. Moreover, if such propaganda is successful,BLOs may well find a refuge with dissident ELAS elements, who will look tothem for leadership.Disadvantage of Gradual Propaganda.10. The British Embassy to Greece are not in favour of a gradual policyof propaganda.   Not only are EAM already well ahead of us in propaganda, but
they have the advantage of daily contact with their subjects and can put overshort-range propaganda effectively. A gradual policy of our part would con-solidate these advantages and would create the suspicion in the Greek mind thatwe hesitated to take strong action. Defensive, dilatory or half-hearted propa-ganda would be fatal.  A strong and quick offensive is the only possible line.Return of Brigadier Myers to Greece.11. The British Embassy to Greece consider that the return of BrigadierMyers to Greece would serve no useful purpose. He was persona grata withEAM largely because it was owing to his policy of appeasement that EAMwere able to establish themselves in a position of such power. His standing withZervas, whom he persuaded against his will to sign the National BandsAgreement, depended entirely on his position as representative of C-in-C,M.E.E. he was listened to and obeyed, but his views caused gravemisgivings. It is inconceivable that, at this stage, Brigadier Myers should beable either to effect a rapprochement between the two parties or to mend thepolitical or military ways of EAM now that they have shown their true colours.To send Brigadier Myers back to Greece as the representative of C-in-C.,M.E.E., would be tantamount to continuing to support EAM, since no matter what conditions the ultimatum he would have to carry imposed, parleys andprocrastinations would inevitably ensue, and even if our conditions were apparently accepted, it is certain that they would not be carried out. Reinstate-ment of the National Bands Agreement and the Joint G.H.Q. would tie thehands of the BLOs and of Zervas and would perpetuate the dominance ofEAM. The proposal of EAM that a joint Commission should be sent into Greeceto ascertain the facts is considered to be an attempt to play for time. Eventsare moving so fast that to delay action during the weeks which must elapse before the Commission could report would be fatal.Summary.12. To sum up, the Embassy feel that the time has come when we can nolonger defer a decision which is most critical for our future relations with greece. They hold that a complete break with EAM/ELAS, accompanied bywhole-hearted support of Zervas is the only immediate policy consistent with british long-term interests. They hold also that this policy offers the best prospect of ensuring that the maximum military value is obtained from Greekresistance groups while the Germans remain in Greece. They express serious concern, owing to the speed&apos;with which EAM/ELAS are ruthlessly pursuingtheir political aims, at the delay in reaching a clear-cut decision.C. The Service Aspect.Policy.13. The Services support the aims outlined in paragraph 6 (b) to (e),particularly (e). They cio not agree with the aim in paragraph 6 (a). Theyconsider that an attempt should be made to compose the differences betweenZervas and EAM/ELAS in order to retain intact the military value of theGreek guerrilla movement as a whole. For this purpose they would like tosee the National Bands Agreement, with its corollary, the Joint G.H.Q. in greece, reinstated. They do not, however, regard this as essential, althoughit would be valuable as a co-ordinating factor. It may be necessary, in orderfully to carry on the resistance movement, to work with two different factions,as in Yuogslavia. They are not concerned with the long-term aspects of policy,but aim at producing, with the greatest possible assistance from the Greeks,trie maximum pressure on the Germans as long as they remain in Greece and atinflicting the maximum damage on them during their withdrawal. For thispurpose resistance movements throughout Greece must be kept going and not allowed to lapse. They are also concerned with the immediate situation in greece following the German withdrawal, and particularly what military eom-commitment it will entail.Military Value of EAM/ELAS compared with El)ICS.14. The Services agree that the military value of Zervas is considerableWest of the Pinclus. but hold that he is, and will remain, impotent East of thePindiis. His strategic value is therefore limited. He does not cover the mainsupply route into Albania, can only attack two aerodromes, and it is East of thePindus that the Salonika-Athens railway, the principal route of German troop
movement, supply and eventual withdrawal, runs, and this must continue to bethe main sabotage objective. To keep this railway constantly cut, Britishsabotage parties must continue to enjoy safe-harbour facilities. It is in theprovision of these facilities that the main military value of EAM/ELAS must continue to lie. While it is true that we can rely on only sporadic military assistance from them in the future, in their present state it is reasonable to expect that they will continue to accord us these facilities. In addition, when theGermans ultimately withdraw, it is essential that the maximum harassing effect should be produced in Salonika. Athens and the Piraeus,&apos;with the special objectof preventing the demolition of dock installations and public utilities. EAM/ELAS are already well established in these urban centres and must be more effective than groups built up precariously de nova. Their anxiety to gain controlof Athens and Salonika will make them the more ready to serve our purpose.Accordingly, anything that might antagonise EAM/ELAS should be avoided.This is the more important in view of recent signs of a change in Balkan strategy and the possibility that operations on an appreciable scale may be undertaken inthe near future.Effect of Propaganda on EAM I ELAS.15. In view of the strong Anglophile feeling in Greece. EAM/ELAS are unlikely to attack the British openly in their propaganda, except in sporadicoutbursts, unless provoked. In the case of sporadic outbursts, it is best to ignoreextravagances and to correct misstatements and distortions by a plain statementof the facts. The traditional friendship of Greece for Britain will prove strongerin the hearts of the Greek people, who are intelligent, than the palpable distor-tions of a group of extremists. It is therefore unnecessary to check EAM/ELASpropaganda by a full-scale counter-offensive. Moreover, it is dangerous, since it will be likely to rally the ELAS rank and file behind their leaders, will giveground for the accusation that the British are inter ferine; in Greek domesticpolitics, and will inflame the Greek people generally against Britain. The short-ranee propaganda which EAM/ELAS can bring to bear1 must be more effective than our own longer-range weapon. Moreover, a full-scale propagandaoffensive by us will also create the impression that EAM/EL AS are having acertain measure of success and that we are getting annoyed at it. By closing the ranks of EAM/ELAS it will have the further effect of denying to Zervas recruitswhich might have reached him as the natural result of EAM/ELAS extremism.In addition, it will be likely to strengthen the hold of RAM/ELAS on greece and perpetuate their dictatorship; left alone, their excesses of themselves, aided by moderate propaganda by us, may well completely lose them the support they now have and they will be thrown out. Further, any suspicion that the Britishare backing Zervas at their expense will incite EAM/ELAS to attack himwhole-heartedly. The recent half-hearted civil strife has now been for the mostpart temporarily suspended, but EAM/ELAS are sufficiently powerful to crushZervas in the immediate future, whether he is supported by the British to the full extent of the limited resources it is possible to send him or not.&apos; Finally, theinstitution of a full-scale propaganda campaign against EAM/ELAS can only make the position of BLOs with ELAS bands more difficult and dangerous thanit is at present.Return of Brigadier Myers to Greece.16. The Services feel that the differences between Zervas and EAM/ELAScan only be composed by the despatch of Brigadier Myers to RAM to reason withthem. While it is preferable that he should be given a free hand in dealing withthem, he could, if the Embassy think it necessary, be armed with an ultimatum for presentation to them should they prove unreasonable. Brigadier Myers has greatpersonal standing with RAM and the ELAS leaders; he has, with Mr. ChurchilRsapproval, broadcast a message from the Prime Minister which included thestatement that he was to return to Greece: his place at this critical stage is atthe head of the British Liaison parties at present in Greece. There is a good chance that Brigadier Myers may succeed in his mission. In view of the serious loss to the British effort in Greece which the defection of EAM/ELAS would be,it is a chance well worth taking. No decision to break with EAM/ELAS wouldbe justified without making every effort to avert it, and to ensure that all infprma-tion on which such action is based is confirmed. In this connection, they point outthat EAM have asked for a joint Commission to be sent to Greece to ascertain the facts.
Return of the King of Greece.17. The Services consider that the main cause for the anti-British trend ofEAM/ELAS recently is the failure of the visit of the six Greeks to Cairo who came out with Brigadier Myers. On their return they spread the story that theBritish were determined to reinstate the King in Greece if necessary by force.It is therefore of the utmost importance that the aim set out in paragraph 6 (e)should be pursued to a successful, result with the last possible delay. If it couldbe publicly stated at an early date that the King would not return to Greeceexcept at the express invitation of his people, the main point at issue betweenEAM/ELAS and ourselves would be removed.Summary.18. To sum up, the Services feel that, as long as the Germans remain in greece, all other considerations must give way before the immediate task of driving them out. Long-term political considerations cannot be allowed tointerfere with the conduct of the war. The continuance of safe harbour facilitiesEast of the Pindus, which would be irretrievably lost if EAM/ELAS wereantagonised, is essential to the conduct of the war in Greece. An early announcement that the King will not return to Greece unless invited by his people, coupled with the return of Brigadier Myers and a moderate propaganda campaign, is the best way of reinstating the position in Greece.I). Conclusions.19. From the foregoing, and from the many papers that have been writtenand the many discussions that have taken place on this subject. I am convincedthat the two opposing points of view cannot be reconciled and that no compromiseis possible. A fundamental difference of view exists regarding the treatmentof EAM/ELAS. The Services genuinely feel that the continued co-operation ofEAM/ELAS is essential to the conduct of the war in Greece; the british embassy to Greece feel equally strongly that continued co-operation withEAM/ELAS would be disastrous to the future of Greco-British relations andwould therefore prejudice our strategic position in the Eastern Mediterranean.It is a straight conflict between the short-term and the long-term view.Unless there are strategic considerations of which I am unaware, I am boundto say that in this particular case the inevitability of a Communist coup d&apos;Etatand the disadvantage of almost certainly being faced with, an unstable and hostileGreece after the war seem to me heavily to outweigh the disadvantages of possiblybeing unable to exert the maximum pressure on the Germans in Greece in thenear future. Moreover, there is a sporting chance that, if our propaganda campaign is positive and strong, we shall in fact lose few, if any, of the militaryadvantages we now enjoy East of the Pindus. If, on the other hand, we adoptthe policy advocated by the Services, Greece will almost certainly pass outsidethe British sphere of influence for many years to come, while I believe that it isat least doubtful whether we shall continue to enjoy safe harbour for our British,sabotage parties in the area East of the Pindus.20. Accordingly, I recommend that the policy advocated by the foreign secretary, as outlined in paragraph 6 above, be adopted in ioto. and in particularthat immediate steps be taken, with all means at our disposal, to destroy the powerof EAM and the ELAS leaders and to build up the power of Zervas. .(Initialled) P.
