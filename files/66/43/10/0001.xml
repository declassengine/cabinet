THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 510.16th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.PALESTINE GENDARMERIE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. I think the War Cabinet should be aware of a proposal which has beenput forward by the High Commissioner for Palestine for the establishment ofa Gendarmerie of some 2,000 British officers and other ranks. This Gendarmeriewould form an integral part of the Palestine Police Force under the adminisfcra-tive control of the Civil Government, but would, like the rest of the PalestinePolice, be placed under the operational control of the G.O.C., Palestine. Theproposal lias the strong support of the G-in-C, Middle East, the Minister ofState Resident and the Middle East War Council.2. The reasons for the proposal are two-fold, first the state of extremetension in Palestine, and secondly the fact that large numbers of the existing british Police Force will be clue to leave Palestine at the end of the war.3. The War Cabinet is well aware of the general political situation inPalestine. In forwarding the present proposal the High Commissioner statedthat there was &quot; the likelihood, almost the certainty, of civil war or, at the least,disturbances on a major scale&quot; in the fairly near future. It is considered thata small force of this kind would be of the greatest value in dealing with the initial stages of any disturbances, though it is recognised that if these developed on aserious scale the regular forces would inevitably have to be called in. AGendarmerie of the kind proposed would have a higher degree of mobility, a betterknowledge of the country, and would be possessed of a higher standard of localIntelligence than would normally be possessed by units of the regular armygarrison at any given time.4. There is also considerable force in the second argument. The existing british Police Force has a total strength of some 3,000. Of this number nearly2,000 are on contract only for the duration of the war, long overdue for leave,or time-expired men compulsorily retained against their will. When they go, itis important that there should be a reservoir of trained men available to take their place. The end of the war is likely to be the most critical period forPalestine.5. The cost of the proposal was estimated by the High Commissioner at 975,000 for the first year and  605,000 recurrent thereafter. These figures may,however, have to be increased, as the rates of pay proposed by him are probablyinsufficient. The Treasury will not object in principle to this scheme on financial grounds.6. I do not anticipate serious political repercussions, although the proposals is perhaps not likely to be popular with either Jews or Arabs. But whatever their real feelings they can hardly-take a strong line against a measure which mustoffer a greater guarantee of local security.7. I seek the approval of the War Cabinet for the formation of a BritishGendarmerie on the lines described above, I have consulted the Secretary of Statefor War and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who agree to this step.O. S.Colonial Office, 16th November, 1943.Copy No.[26386]
