IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. / Copy No.W.P. (43) 542.28th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.TRANSFER OF CRUISERS AND FLEET DESTROYERS TO CANADA.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.ON the 1st April the War Cabinet approved (W.M. (43), 47th Conclusions,Item 2) my recommendation in W.P. (43) 128 that four destroyers should be trans-ferred as a gift to the Royal Canadian Navy, and stated that they would be disposed to agree that a further 2 destroyers, which we had told the Canadianswe should try and make available later in the year, should also be a gift. Thetransfer of these two destroyers, H.M.S. Hero and H.M.S. Foxhound, will shortlytake place. In the meantime, however, the Canadians have put forward a far-reaching proposal for increasing the strength of their Navy by the transfer ofships from this country.At the Quebec Conference, Mr. Mackenzie King was told by the PrimeMinister that we should be disposed to give favourable consideration to a request from them for the transfer of two &quot; Fiji &quot; Class cruisers and two modern Fleetdestroyers. This would certainly ease our own acute man-power situation, andwould at the same time give the Canadians an opportunity for forming the nucleus of a post-war Navy of larger dimensions than they have hitherto maintained inpeace-time.The Admiralty are, at the moment, discussing with the Canadian naval authorities which particular vessels should be transferred, and it may be sometime before we are able to designate particular vessels. As the Canadian per-sonnel taking over the cruisers will have to receive considerable training, the ships that will most probably be selected are Minotaur (completing June 1944) andSuperb (completing, August 1944).The Canadian Naval Board have asked the Admiralty to suggest terms of transfer, and I think we should now decide these terms so that we may make our proposals on this point at the same time as we designate the vessels we areprepared to turn over. Our natural desire, in view of the great financialassistance that Canada has afforded and is affording us, first under the BillionDollar Gift and now under the Mutual Aid Act, would be to make these fourvessels, as well as the two escort destroyers still to be transferred, a straightforwardgift. The gift of ships to Canada could scarcely create any difficulties withthe other Dominions, since (1) we have recently given a cruiser to Australia, andtwo corvettes to New Zealand, and (2) a gift of these vessels to Canada may beregarded as a form of reciprocal aid. Such, gifts in war-time need not create a peace-time precedent. An -indication was given in a &quot;recent speech by theCanadian Navy Minister that Canada might prefer to pay for all these vessels,including the Hero and Foxhound, in order to increase our own dollar balances.More recently, however, Mr. Massey has indicated that his Government would welcome a gift, and I therefore propose that a formal offer of these ships as agift should be made. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary offttate for Dominion Affairs concur.A. Y. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1.28th November, 1943.[26496]&apos;
