THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 518.14th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS GREECE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON my way to and from the Moscow Conference I had the opportunity., in cairo, of studying at close quarters the Greek position, and there are certain points which I would wish to put before my colleagues. The aims of our policy towards Greece are threefold : (a) to honour our alliance with the King of the Hellenes and the GreekGovernment by giving them all the support we can;(b) to ensure that on liberation the country does not relapse into chaos orbecome subject to a minority dictatorship;(c) to maintain and strengthen  the traditional  ties between  our twocountries, so that after the war we can rely on the friendship of greece, which is essential to our political and strategical position inSouth-East Europe and the Mediterranean.2. Pro-British sentiment in Greece is strong and universal, but manyfactors have contributed to put a severe strain on the loyalty of Greeks to theBritish connexion. Our support of the King is unpopular. We have been ableto undertake no major operations for the liberation of Greece in the two and a half years since the German conquest. The capitulation of Italy has not been as rapidly or as widely exploited as the Greek people hoped, so that they now have to face another winter of occupation. Italian co-belligerence, of which enemy propaganda has made full use, has caused deep concern. Even our support for the guerrillas must seem to many Greeks cynical and self-interested, since ithas led to savage reprisals without any very tangible benefits to the war effort.As a result of these and other factors, our credit balance is overdrawn to such an extent that we shall have great difficulty in achieving our immediate aims, set outin (a) and (b) above, while our long-term position in Greece, if counter-measures are not soon taken, may be seriously threatened.3. The event which has raised major issues of policy in an acute form isthe outbreak of civil war between E.A.M. (with its military branch E.L.A.S.)and other organisations, principally E.D.E.S. E.L.A.S., the most powerful ofthese organisations, comprises 15,000 out of a, total of 20,000 guerrillas now underarms. Most of its leaders and most of the members of its controlling committeeare Communists, but this is not true of the rank and file; the organisation is strongly anti-monarchist. E.D.E.S., whose leader is Zervas, is the second most powerful organisation operating and numbers about 5,000 guerrillas; they &quot;aremoderate republicans, but would probably agree to the return of the King of greece if Flis Majesty&apos;s Government advised this course. We have Britishliaison officers attached to both these organisations, and have hitherto supportedboth of them because (a) we hoped thereby to increase their powers of resistanceagainst the Germans and (&amp;) they have provided safe harbourage for our sabotageactivities. It is, however, becoming increasingly clear that the leaders ofK.A.M.-E.L.A.S. are more interested in building up their own personal position than in fighting the Germans. Their present attack on other bands is not anisolated fiction, but is the culminating instance of their deliberate policy ofeliminating all potential rivals. There can be no doubt that their aim is to seizecontrol of the country the moment the Germans withdraw. .,[26417]
4. The main point to be considered, then, is whether or not we shouldcontinue to support and build up E.A.M., who have already murdered one Britishliaison officer and maltreated others and have adopted an openly anti-british attitude in their propaganda.   The disadvantages of doing so are as follows :  It is most improbable that we could secure their whole-hearted co-operation in future, whatever attitude we now adopt towards them. If we continue tosupport them, they will regard this as a sign of -weakness, and the blackmailthey will attempt to extract from us will increase progressively; nor is there anysolid prospect of our being able to deter them from their principal aim ofsecuring power in Greece for themselves. Further, the Greek Government haveviewed with increasing concern our association with E.A.M. If we persist inthis policy, it will be the first occasion on which we have pursued a course ofaction in respect of an enemy-occupied country which is contrary to the wishes of its recognised Government. The effect would almost certainly be to bringabout the resignation of the Greek Government, which would leave on our handsa number of important and difficult problems not the least of which would bethe question of the authority to whom the Greek navy and merchant marine willbe responsible. Nor are the longer term disadvantages of continuing to supportE.A.M. less serious. We should be doing; a great disservice to the Greek peopleby strengthening a gang of ruthless fanatics whose intention is to impose a minority dictatorship to the exclusion of all other groups and parties. It wouldalso be against our own interests for Greece to be governed after the war byE.A.M., whose leaders are likely to look to Russia rather than ourselves. TheRussians showed no interest at the Moscow Conference in the Greek situation,and it may be that they regard Greece as being within our sphere of influence;but this attitude might well change if E.A.M. gained complete control in Greece.5. The E.L.A.S. bands, moreover, are militarily of little or no value againstthe Germans, since their leaders will risk no engagement which might cause themserious casualties and so weaken their position. Their main value is that they provide safe harbourage for the British officers who themselves carry out all thesabotage. In any,case, we may hope that if we break with E.A.M., the loss of facilities for British officers would only be temporary. The rank and file ofE.A.M.-E.L.A.S. are for the most part not Communist, and there is some evidencethat they are becoming dissatisfied with the extremist policy dictated by their leaders. We might, therefore, hope to build up in E.L.A.S. areas genuinelynationalist bands, which would provide the safe harbourage required for british officers and might well play a more active role against the Germans.6. I am therefore of the opinion that both the short and long-term, political disadvantages which would flow from a policy of continuing to support E.A.M.considerably outweigh the military advantages which we might hope to gain from, such action.7. If we break with E.A.M. and attempt to discredit the leaders of theorganisation, we must at the same time aim at uniting and building up the moderate elements, on which a temporary administration could be based as soonas the Germans withdraw. We cannot hope to redress the present balance of power in Greece merely by giving or withholding money and supplies from one side or the other, since E.A.M. already possess sufficient stocks of arms to make them, virtually independent of us. and would never willingly permit any rivalgroups to gain parity with them. We must, therefore, rely very largely on propaganda both for uniting moderate opinion and for winning over fromE.A.M. the moderate elements which form a large proportion of E.A.M.&apos;s membership.8. If we launch a propaganda campaign against the E.A.M. leaders, wecannot avoid raising the constitutional issue and the question of the King&apos; return. The undeniable connexion of the King with the Metaxas regime and the campaign of vilification which K.A.M. have carried on for the past two years have resulted in turning at least 80 per cent, of the Greek people against theKing. We are virtually alone in giving him support, and our influence in Greeceis not strong enough to ensure that the majority of the Greek people would acceptthe King&apos;s return to his country before the constitutional issue has been settled.So long as E.A.M. can. insinuate that we intend to reimpose the King at the pointof British bayonets, they will be successful both in retaining the loyalty of their
own members and in keeping moderate opinion hopelessly divided. Unlesstherefore the influence of E.A.M. can be broken, I am convinced that the monarchy has no hope of surviving. I am also convinced that if the influence ofE.A.M. is to be broken, the King must give a public pledge that he will not return to Greece until the constitutional issue has been settled either by a plebiscite or by elections for a Constituent Assembly.9. We could not advise the King to give such an undertaking, nor could we expect him to agree, unless all possible measures are taken to safeguard hisinterests; and we are under every obligation of honour to safeguard those interests. The only effective means of doing this appears to be that the King, atthe moment of his country&apos;s liberation, should nominate a Regency Council,which would then hold office until the Greek people had decided the constitutionalissue. A leading member of such a Regency Council might well be Damaskinos,the Archbishop of Athens, who, by his courageous attitude, has won widespreadrespect throughout Greece, and another might be a leading and popular generalof moderate views.10.   I therefore recommend that the following steps should be taken : &apos; (1) We should at once break with the present leaders of E.A.M.-E.L.A.S. (we- have already withdrawn support from them) and direct propaganda against them. The stages of this could be worked out by theMiddle East Defence Committee.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government should be instructedto explain to the King of the Hellenes both the situation as we see itand the measures we propose to adopt. The King should be invitedto make a declaration stating that at the moment of liberation aRegency Council composed of leading personalities will be nominated,and that he himself will remain outside Greece until the constitutionalissue has been settled.(3) The King of the Hellenes, should immediately, and in secret, authoriseArchbishop Damaskinos to appoint such a Regency Council when thetime comes, and should encourage him meanwhile to take the lead inuniting moderate opinion.11: The measures outlined above are, in my opinion, the best which can be devised to deal with the immediate problems. I do not consider, however, that by themselves they will be sufficient to re-establish British credit in Greece, onwhich we have drawn so heavily in the past two years. If our long-term positionis to be safeguarded and the attainment of our immediate objectives facilitated,further concrete measures must be taken to restore Greek confidence inGreat Britain.   Such measures can only be of two kinds : (a) Military action.(b) Provision of relief.The difficulties in the way of (a) are evident, particularly if Turkey fails to enter the war. We may therefore be forced back upon the provision of relief supplies.In my view something should now be done to, increase the relief which is beingdistributed by the Swedish-Swiss organisation in Greece, but the decisive momentwill come either when we establish a bridgehead in Greece, or when the Germanswithdraw from part or the whole of the country. I would therefore suggest that immediate steps should be taken (a) To  increase  the  present-day  relief   for   which  the   Swedish-Swissorganisation is responsible, and(b) To ensure that adequate stocks of food and other relief goods areavailable in the Middle liast, and that plans are perfected for their transport to Greece and their distribution within the country, againstthe day of the German withdrawal.A.
