NO.   3,lfc,6th November, l%-3.WAR.::::CABHBTPOLICY.TOWARDS GREECEMemorandum by Minister of Economic WarfareWith reference to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum W.P.(43)518,my previous recommendations in regard to E.L.A.S. have been based onthe hypothesis that the continuance of maximum military resistance tothe Axis in Greece was essential.   If the military authorities havedecided that this is no longer the case, I should welcome anorientation of our policy in the direction suggested by the foreign secretary.   There is, however, an aspect of the matter on which I amgreatly concerned, viz: the lives of the eighty officers and other ranks at present serving with E.L.A.S.   They are hostages to E.L.A.S.ard I request that the C.-in-C, Middle East be given the widestdiscretion as to the manner and time of making any breach withE.L.A.S. so as to secure their safety.   He should also be given authority to announce at the appropriate moment, if necessary, thatif anything happens to them, Messrs,   Sarafis, Vasilis and other leaders of B,L,A.S. will be held personally responsible, and their names will be placed on the list of criminals to whom no sanctuarywill be open after the war.2,     In regard to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestions for further relaxation of the blockade of Greece, the following points should benoted.3.     So far as suggestion (a) is concerned we are at present sending&apos;to Greece as much food (about 18,000 tons per month of foodstuffs -wheat, pulse, tinned milk) as the Swedish ships allocated to this service can carry.k.    Six weeks or more ago we asked for an extra Swedish ship to be released from the Baltic for this service, but the Swedes have notyet been able to obtain an answer from the Germans on this proposal,(\    Some 20-30,000 tons of foodstuffs (in all, not each month)fay be obtainable in   Turkey, but the Germans object in principle to shipments between Turkish and   -reek ports, and it is very unlikelythat their consent will be forthcoming.   Moreover, certain questionsof finance, shipping and supply would have to be considered whendetails of this suggested supply from Turkey (which have alreadybeen requested) have been received from the Greeks.6.    The Swedish control commission has not reported any deterioration in the Greek food position, and has not asked for any increase in therato of supplies for Greece.   We have, however, been advised bymembers of the Commission that conditions this winter are likely to&apos;0e considerably worse than in the last twelve months on account of:-

The Americans are said to be giving sympathetic considerationto the idea of collecting and sending used clothing and shoes for children in Greece.   There are difficulties in the way of treatingC-reeee differently to other countries in this respect, but ifnecessary we could make out some sort of case for doing so.   my information also is that the need of clothes this winter is likelyto be even more acute than the need of food.9.    So far as (b) is concerned, I agree that this is most desirable,subject to the needs of Europe as a whole;.16th November, 1%3.
