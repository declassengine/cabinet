(THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY . OF HIS- BRITTANIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)   I-.?j (U3)5Q6     - . - copy no.   ; v..Rth November,  19U3 - - : &apos;      &apos;WAR CABINET . .W 0 R L D _gQ 0 D_SUPPLI  ESMe-morandum &quot;by the Minister of Food ^I am circulating these notes for : the information of mycolleagues.Deterioration in World Food SuppliesX, The following factors have led to a steady deterioration inthe supply position of food for the non-Axis .&apos;-&apos;orl&amp;.(a) the loss of food exports from continental Europe and aa -fall in the output of livestock-products in the United kingdom which together represent a reduction in food supplies, equivalent to25% meat and bacon, .i\.h% eggs&apos; and 78% fish consumption in theUnited Kingdom before, the war,   w&quot;(b) the annual loss from the Par East of some 3 million tonsof rice?which represents about 90% of rice exports to-areas outsidethose now under Japanese control,  1,600,000 tons fats  (about h.0%of pre-war world exports) and 1.,.2-50,-000 tons sugar  (about 20% of pre-war world exports).&apos;   - &quot;(c) the annual loss of some 500,000 tons whale oil  (thegreater part of world supplies)..-&apos;  --(d) the fact that increased production in overseas territories- notably North America,  has been -largely offset by  (i) mounting.        -Service requirements, and (ii) heavier consumption by civilianswith increased spending power.(c) Russian    demands on outside supplies.(f) the progressive contraction in the supply of labour andequipment, for the production, processing and transport of foodowing to the growing mobilisation of men and materials for war purposes.-(g) the reduction in yields in some countries  (notably theSouthern Dominions and South Africa) owing to a shortage of fertilisers.As a result there arc likely to be world shortages of certain foodsafter the war.Availability of Supplies for. Continental EuropePending a detailed review of world supplies and import-cquiroments by the Combined Pood Board,  the amount of food available for continental Europe,  if it should be liberated in 19UH-9  is estimated asfollows :- K______________/J^)___- It is assumed for the purpose of these estimates that&quot;(a) existing consumption levels continue and 19U3/M+.production targets -of the Unites Nations arc&apos;realised in non-Axis territories;yo) Russian requirements continue at current levels;(c) Existing stock levels in consuming countries are maintained;(&amp;) None of the Par-Eastern sources of supply are recovered beforeEurope is liberated.
(a) Rice. None. - The.ro-is -already an ^unsatisfied,demand in countries where rice &quot;is a staple item of .di.o.t, ;Q.(b) Moat,_including &quot;bacon. , None. - - Available supplies arebarely sufficient to. meet requirements at current restricted level!of consumption.(c ) .. Milk products. None *(d) .-Cannccl fish.      Small quantities only.-   (a.) Dried Fruits.    Practically none until Greek exports arcresumed.(f) Fats.   -About 500,000 tons  (including inedible fats), V7niJis very far short of prc-v/ar European consumption levels and is dependent on the extensive use of fat from cocoa beans and oflinseed for edible purposes and. on the acquisition of Argentina Vsurplus of oilseeds.(g) Sugar.-     Sufficient for European requirements providedconsumption is not increased elsewhere.      With the improved shippjjposition, however,  and the shortage of.other foods there is a growing tendency, particularly in the United States,  for sugarconsumption to increase.    If rationing restrictions were complete!removed demand would greatly exceed existing supplies in thenon-Axis world.(h) Cereals and cereal products. . Sufficient supplies exist,,but owing to shortage of shipping, internal transport difficultiesin North America and limited milling facilities it is impossiblcafpresent to. estimate the quantities that could actually be madeavailable to liberated Europe-Current production in non-Axiscountries is already below the current rate of consumption and the deficiency would be vastly greater if the potential requirements for livestock feeding were met.Measures_to increase supplies3. The London Food Committee and the Combined Food Board have consistently emphasised the need for producing countries to increase output and one of the principal tasks of our representatives&apos; in allthese- countries has been to secure the- largest possible supply forexport.  . Considerable increases in production have been effected in north America.      Attempts have been made in the Colonies to stimulatenative production by supplying fertilisers and by providing consumer goods, as an incentive to further effort.      In this country we have-notonly vastly increased agricultural production but have also made other:contributions such as using &quot;technical&quot; oils not previously used foredible purposes and cocoa bean fat for margarine *The Future Outlookd. Farther substantial increases inrroduction   are not probableuntil the process of demobilisation &quot;of men and materials has had timetake of fee t.      Inclec dappears inevitable.of meat,  milk products,- fats and rice,  it is probable  that sugar andcereals will not be available in sufficient quantities to meet the i-of&apos;, continental-Europe. .....5* The Governments of most producing countries have introducedsome restrictions on f ooet &apos;0otisump-t!on (see appendix).    - With theexception...of North America the savings are necessarily small owing tothe &quot;geography of the countries,   the smallnoss of their population, and the difficulties of controlling local usage.    On the other hand, unless!Governments in producing countries take steps to conserve suppliesWimposing greater sacrifices on their&apos; people our position will remainprecarious and it is difficult to see how the feeding of liberated countries in Europe can be substantially supplemented from outside thelown areas.-some decline from the peak levels of 19U2/U3Consequently,  in addition to definite shortages
6. Every effort will continue  to bo made to stimulate productionvjy the methods so far employed, &quot;but I am doubtful about their adequacyin present circumstances *      The producers must he river, the necessaryconfidence and I am about to propose in a paper submitted to the lord president&apos;s Committee that I should be authorised, where&apos; this: methodis suitable for the particular commodity,  to conclude long-term contracts with Dominion, Colonial and foreign Governments concerned.By this means I would hope to mitigate acute shortages during and shortly after the war and at the same time to arrange such a stabilisation0f prices as would prevent a rapid rise in .the world Costs of food as/on as commercial channels were once more open.&apos;  W.Ministry of Pood,  W.l.5th November, 19U3.

There is nomargarine in Canada,  but an almost unlimited supply of cookingfat as a by-product of bacon production.(i-g   . Meat rationing was introdued in May 1943.      The.scheme covers. &quot;beof., veal, mutton and lamb, pork (including bacon), and freshsausages, but excludes offals,  certain.cooked meats and&apos;allcuts containing more than 50%.bone.      The values have been estimated on the basis of an average entitlement of about lb. per head per week (representing about lvj lbs.  edible meat).(v)      Preserves were rationed as a group on 2nd September last.    Thereis one coupon for each two-week period, valid, alternativelyfor rjr lb.
