Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 507.8th November, 1943,WAR CABINET.NEWFOUNDLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. In W.P. (43) 102 of the 9th March, 1943, my predecessor gave warning that we should be faced with a difficult constitutional problem in Newfoundlandas soon as the war ended. It was prematurei at that time to come to any conclusions, but he thought that as an interim measure it would be a wise stepto send out to Newfoundland in 1943 an informal &quot; goodwill &quot; Mission, composedof three Members of Parliament; this he felt would serve the double purpose bothof showing Newfoundlanders that we had their problems very much in mind andof enabling Parliamentary opinion here to be kept more closely informed aboutthe Newfoundland situation against the time when decisions would have to betaken.2. The War Cabinet approved this proposal, and an informal ParliamentaryMission composed of Mr. Ammon, Sir D. Gunston and Mr. A. P. Herbert left forNewfoundland in June, travelled all over the country, mixing with the people,studying conditions and listening to their ideas as to the future, and returnedhome at the end of September. From a public standpoint their tour was a very successful one, and there is no doubt that as a gesture to the people of Newfound-land, indicating the interest of Parliament in their affairs, it has been highlyappreciated.3. It was, of course, made clear throughout that the Mission, being of an informal &quot; goodwill &quot; character, was not intended as a Commission of Enquiry.It was thus given no set terms of reference and there was no question of it being asked to produce a report for publication. At the same time, it was indicated to the Members that the Secretary of State would naturally welcome a confidentialexpression of their views and suggestions on their return.4. In the result, each of the Members has presented me with a separate report containing his impressions and recommendations. Many of these relateto the development of the country&apos;s industries and public services; on the consti-tutional issue the ideas they have each put forward, which have a great deal in common, are summarised in Appendix A. There has been some pressure in theHouse for the publication of these reports, but this would be quite inappropriate,and I have resisted it. It has been made clear, however, that the three members will, of course, be free to express their views when Dominion affairs come up for debate, and a suitable opportunity is. I understand, likely to occur during the debate on the Address.5. As was expected, the three Members found Newfoundland opinion on thesubject of constitutional change very fluid and divided. Newfoundlanders were,however, on the whole agreed on three main points : (1) while, after nearly tenyears of political disfranchisement, the country as a whole is looking forward to achange of system, no change should be made in the present form of government during the war; (2) when a change is made, it should not take the form of a returnto full responsible government on the lines of that in force prior to 1934; (3) con-federation with Canada is looked upon as wholly out of the question.6.   (1) is very satisfactory, since in view of Newfoundland^-important roleas a Naval and Air Base we should clearly wish to avoid any disturbance of publicopinion which would distract attention from the war effort.   Moreover, it would[26381] B
be manifestly inappropriate that the country&apos;s future should be settled at a timewhen conditions&apos;are so artificial and so many Newfoundlanders, including someof the Island&apos;s potential leaders, are now serving overseas in various capacities.At the back of (2) lies the Newfoundlanders&apos; distrust of their politicians andpublic figures and their lack of confidence in themselves and in the ability of the island to stand permanently on its own feet. They have not forgotten the lessonthey learned so painfully in the depression years of the &quot;thirties, and they fearthe&apos;type of man whom a&quot; general election might return to power. At the back of(3) lies the traditional dislike of Canada. Confederation with Canada would in-many ways be the best long-term solution, and now that the Island has become ofsuch importance strategically to Canada, which has to reckon also with thespreading of United States influence as a result of the establishment of UnitedStates Bases in the Island, the Canadian Government are certainly not dis-interested in the future of Newfoundland. This is, however, a matter in whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom could not directly intervene.Clearly, union with Canada cannot be brought about except at the publiclyexpressed wish of the Newfoundlanders themselves, and it is evident that atpresent only a very small minority of Newfoundlanders would be in favour ofsuch a solution. Fears of Canadian rates of direct taxation, the prospect thatNewfoundlands small stores and business houses would be swamped by the largeCanadian firms, and the feeling that Newfoundlands interests would be sacrificedto those of Toronto and Montreal would alone be sufficient to ensure a heavypopular vote against the idea, so long as there is money in the till and no pressingnecessity for so drastic a step.7. In certain quarters in this country it has been suggested that a solution might be found in the linking of Newfoundland not with Canada but with theUnited Kingdom, on similar lines to Northern Ireland. There is, however nodemand in the Island for such a step and I am satisfied that any such solution wouldbe an artificial one likely to bring great difficulties in its train. The plain fact is that Newfoundland, though intensely loyal to the mother-country and intensely&quot; British &quot; in sentiment, is part of North America, with a Transatlantic outlook,habits and ways of thought; in its everyday life it is bound at every turn bythe solid ties of common interest with the North American continent. I am sure that notwithstanding the narrowing of the world by air communication it wouldbe a mistake for us to attempt to ignore geography.8. It is clear from the reports of the Members of the Mission that whatmost Newfoundlanders would like to look forward to after the war would be some form of self-government which, while leaving the Island free to manageits own affairs, would provide for the retention by the United Kingdom of agenera] supervision over its finances and would thus enable it to turn forassistance to the United Kingdom Exchequer in case of need. In other words,they would like both to eat their cake and have it. Such a form of Governmentwould clearly be very difficult to administer, and might indeed result in a trainingnot in responsibility. but in irresponsibility. It is difficult, however, not tosympathise with the view that it would be altogether too much to expect the Islandwith its limited resources in personnel to resume full self-government successfullyin one plunge, and if it should prove to be the general desire that progress towards full responsible government should be by stages, we shall, I think, haveto examine carefully how best we can meet such a request.9. Under the terms of our bargain with the Newfoundland people in 1933we are pledged to restore self-government, if the people so request, as soon asthe Island is &quot; self-supporting &quot; again. Between 1933 and 1940 the Islandrequired considerable financial assistance from this country. But during thelast three years Newfoundland has been entirely free of grants-in-aid and hasindeed, as a result of war developments, built up a useful surplus of over$11,000,000. Technically, therefore, the Island is at present self-supporting,though it is a matter for argument whether it is likely to remain so in the more normal conditions of peace.10. Reviewing the position against this background, our policy should, Iconsider, be based on the following main points : (a) there should be no change in the present form of Government while thewar lasts;(&amp;) as soon as practicable after the end of the war^th-at-is-the war/in Europe,we must provide machinery (see.th.e_follo.wing paragraph) for enabling
the Newfoundland people to examine the situation and to express their considered views as to the form of Government they desire,having regard to the financial and economic conditions prevailing atthe time,;(c) if the general wish of the people should be for a return to full responsible government, we for our part shall be very ready, if the Island is thenself-supporting, to facilitate such a change;(d) if, however, the general wish should be either for the continuance ofthe present form of Government or for some change of system whichwould fall short of full responsible government, we shall be preparedto examine such proposals sympathetically and consider within whatlimits the continued acceptance of responsibility by the UnitedKingdom could be recqmmended to Parliament;(e) in the meantime, a vigorous attempt should made to push on with thedevelopment of local Government, on which the members of the Missionhave made some interesting recommendations, as well as with generalreconstruction plans. Newfoundland is a country in which municipaland rural councils are virtually non-existent, and, indeed, traditionallydisliked. If in the near future the people are to be called upon to govern themselves, it. is-import-an^-that iSvery effort should be made toencourage the development of local Government institutions, whichwould afford a base for an effective central Government.11. As regards (b) above, I feel we should leave open at the present stage the form of the &quot; machinery &quot; to be provided. One proposal for the solution ofthis problem which appeals&apos;to me is that made by Mr. A. P. Herbert, M.P., viz.,that a national Convention should be set up after the war, composed of membersrepresentative of all classes and interests in Newfoundland, and empowered todiscuss and determine amongst themselves, with the guidance of a constitutionallawyer from home, the form of government to be recommended both to the newfoundland people and to the United Kingdom Government. I should liketo consult the Governor and the Commissioners on this suggestion, which, thoughopen to- difficulties, might carry greater local appeal, and might in some ways bemore effective, than the possible alternative of the appointment of a RoyalCommission. Newfoundland in recent years has been subjected to a variety of enquiries, both official and unofficial, and it seems unlikely that a Royal Commis-sion would be able to learn more of the people&apos;s views than has been acquired bythe informal Mission which has just completed its duties. Besides this, thedespatch of another Commission from this country might create in Newfoundlandthe suspicion that we were endeavouring to put off the day when the people couldconsider their future for themselves.12. As regards (c) above, the contingency must not be overlooked thatNewfoundland^ present relative prosperity, admittedly artificial in that it ariseslargely from war conditions, may prove to be short-lived.- Indeed, it is not at allbeyond the bounds of possibility that the tapering off of construction work on defence projects, combined with a shortage of ships for carrying Newfoundlandsexports, may lead to an economic relapse in Newfoundland even before the warends. If the end of the war should find the Island unable, as in 1939, to pay herway from her current resources, this would change the. whole situation.13. As regards id) above, what I have particularly in mind is that no formof constitution could be regarded as acceptable from the United Kingdom stand-point which gave the Newfoundland Government a free hand in spending whilethe United Kingdom stood behind and guaranteed their expenditure. In other words, if the United Kingdom Government is to be ultimately responsible for the island&apos;s finances, it will be essential for it to retain some measure of control overthe Island&apos;s expenditure. From this point of view the devising of a mutuallyacceptable half-way house is likely to present great difficulty, and it goes without saying that we, for our part, would much prefer a clear-cut solution; but if thepeople of Newfoundland should opt for something on these lines, as a first step towards the resumption of full self-government, it would clearly be incumbent onus to respond to their-request. In that event some form of representative govern-ment, with adequate safeguards but the minimum of restrictions, would perhapsmeet the case.14.   It.will be seen from the Appendix that the Members of the Mission,while each envisaging the holding of a plebiscite in Newfoundland at some suit-able date after the end of the war, have each recommended that as &quot;an interim[26381] B 2
measure, and in order to make the present Commission more representative, pro-vision should be made for the election by popular vote of the three NewfoundlandCommissioners. I have carefully examined this suggestion, but feel bound to reject it. Such a change would need prior consultation with the people of new foundland and would cut across the proposals outlined in paragraphs 10 and11 above. Moreover, apart from the undesirability of tinkering with the present form of government pending consideration of some major change after the war, ameasure of this kind would be open to strong objections, both in theory and inpractice. From the constitutional standpoint it is clear that the Governor in commission would be placed in an anomalous position in the discharge of his responsibility to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and through himto Parliament, if three of the Commissioners owed their appointments to popularvote and were thus simultaneously responsible to the electorate; moreover, therewould in practice be a great risk of the election of unsuitable men, leading in turn to disharmony in the Commission and thus possibly to the premature break-up ofthe whole system of Commission Government.15. Other things being equal, there might have been much to be said fordeferring any announcement of policy at this stage until the Island&apos;s post-war economic prospects were clearer and some definite trend in Newfoundland opinioncould be discerned. But the visit of the Parliamentary Mission, following on the visit which my predecessor himself paid to the Island last year, has encouragedexpectations of an early announcement by His Majesty&apos;s Government and has given rise to much speculation as to &quot;the plans we have in view. An early announcement on broad lines, making it clear that there will be no change duringthe war and that after the war it will be for the Newfoundland people themselvesto choose the path they want to tread, will, I feel, have a steadying effect in the island; and I should like, therefore, if my colleagues agree and subject to consultation with the Governor, to arrange for a declaration of policy on thelines indicated in paragraph 10 above to be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment when Dominion affairs come up for discussion in the House ofCommons during the Debate on the Address.16. In the above survey I have dealt only with the constitutional aspectsof the problem. The members of the Parliamentary Mission have made manyuseful suggestions in their reports touching not only the development of localGovernment but also a number of other administrative and economic matters.I need not discuss these suggestions here, but 1 propose to consider them in detail,in consultation with the Newfoundland Government, in pursuance of the generalpolicy outlined in paragraph 10 (e) above.C.Dominions Office,8th November, 1943.
