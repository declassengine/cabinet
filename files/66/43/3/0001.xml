THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIE BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (43) 503.5th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.REBUILDING OF STALINGRAD.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.(Previous Papers:  W P&apos;. (43) 256 and 306.)AFTER reading my letter of the 6th September to the Soviet Charged&apos;Affaires (see W.P. (43) 306), M. Maisky again wrote to me and asked me to reconsider my decision about the provision of equipment for the reconstruction of Stalingrad.Accordingly, I instructed the Secretary of the Allied Supplies Executive todiscuss the request further with the Soviet Trade Delegation.In this discussion, the head of the Soviet Trade Delegation said that these supplies were needed, not for post-war reconstruction, but for war purposes., thatis, so that war production could be started again in Stalingrad.This is a new argument, and one that might well have been advanced before,instead of the arguments used in M. Maisky&apos;s letter. However, now that it hasbeen advanced, we must try to offer the supplies, because we can hardly question the Russians&apos; statement of what they are needed for, and we are already offeringsupplies of these kinds for other places in the U.S.S.R.I have therefore asked that the possibility of providing this equipmentshould be examined at once, and that the Soviet request should be met as fully as possible.   I have written to M. Sobolevvto this effect.Annexed are copies of M. Mai sky&apos;s letter to me and of my reply..0. L.Ministry of Production, S.W. 1,ON my return from Moscow I found you]&apos; letter of the 4th July, 1943, toM. Sobolev, being a reply to my letter of the 30th June concerning the rebuilding of Stalingrad. I must confess that your letter is very disappointing, and i cannot reconcile myself to the idea that this is the final decision. I spoke a fewdays ago on this subject with the Foreign Secretary and asked him to reconsider the matter. May I respectfully request you to join in this reconsideration andto accord it your utmost sympathy ?I take the liberty to emphasise once more that the case of Stalingrad is quitean exceptional one and should be treated exceptionally, the more so as the amountof work necessary is so limited that it cannot in any way impede your war effort.5th November, 1943.M. Maisky to Mr. Lyttelton.My dear MinisterQth September, 1943.(Signed)Yours sincerely,1) J. MAISKY.[26363,1
mr. Lyttelton to M. Sobolev.My dear Minister,   - 30th September, 1943.M. Maisky wrote to me on the 6th September about the rebuilding of stalingrad. In order to help me to understand your position, I instructed theSecretary of the Allied Supplies Executive to discuss the details with the Headof the Soviet Trade Delegation, and I have now had a report of that discussion.I must begin by repeating that we must consider this in relation to war production. I cannot, I am afraid, accept M. Maisky&apos;s view that the amount is so limited that it cannot interfere with war production. It is large enough totake up an appreciable amount of man-power and factory space. I should never,for example, approve the building of a telephone exchange for this countryone-tenth the size of the one you ask for, for any purpose but a direct contributionto the war.I now understand, however, from what M. Borisenko said to Mr. Chilver,that the equipment you have in mind is needed for the war, and is part of yourplan for restoring war production in the cities you have recaptured. If that is so, it materially alters the situation, and it would be unreasonable for me torefuse to see what we can do to supply this equipment, the more so as we arealready examining the possibility of making telephone exchanges for a number ofother towns in which you are restarting production after their devastation by theGermans, and we have on hand a large programme of power stations and areacceDtins: more under the Third Protocol.In that light. I have given instructions that the possibility of our supplyingthis equipment is to be at once examined. For the hospital equipment and the cables we shall, of course, need more information to enable us to examine theposition, and I understand that M. Borisenko is sending this to Mr. Chilver.How much we can supply, and, more important, how soon we can supplyit, depends&apos; on the production situation, as it does with other orders we are working on for you. Where, as seems possible with the telephone equipment,the orders for Stalingrad would compete with other orders for your country, itwill be for you to assign such supplies as we can make to Stalingrad or elsewhereas you think fit. I must make no promises of delivery which 1 cannot be certain of performing, at any rate without interfering with that part of production towhich the strategic situation necessarily gives the highest priority. But ordersfor equipment needed to help Stalingrad to play a part in the task of throwingback the enemy will thus have a place in the list of equipment we are making for you, and I know that all those engaged on the work will feel proud to thinkthat it will be to Stalingrad that their work will go.Yours sincerely,OLIVER LYTTELTON.
