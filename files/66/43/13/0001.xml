Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.Tuesday, 23rd November, 1943.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,During the past year My peoples and those of My Allies have been brought,by God&apos;s providence, to a turning point in their unceasing fight for freedom.The mounting strength of the United Nations has enabled them to wrest theinitiative from the enemy and to take the offensive in all parts of the world.Our common purpose has been furthered by an ever closer co-operationbetween the United Nations above all between My Governments and those ofour Allies in the United States and the Soviet Union. My Prime Minister hasthree times met in conference the President of the United States. The foreign secretary has recently returned from concerting with M. Molotov and Mr. Cor dellHull plans for the joint conduct of the war and for a united approach to theproblems of the transition from war to peace. It is a matter for gratificationthat the Chinese Government associated themselves with one of the moreimportant instruments resulting from that Conference. The results of this mostfruitful meeting in Moscow have brought new hope to all who look to a speedyvictory over our enemies and a just and enduring peace. I rejoice in the warmthof the reception accorded to My Ministers in Washington and Moscow and inthe historic city of Quebec in My Dominion of Canada.In the various theatres of war throughout the world My Navy, Army andAir Force have fought in close and continuous fellowship with their comradesfrom My Dominions and India and My Colonial Empire, and with the forcesof the United States and My other Allies. Their united efforts have producedsolid and striking achievements in every theatre of war.The dangerous attack of the U-boats has been largely broken by our Naviesand Air Forces, whose continued success rejoices all our hearts. Their task willbe notably eased by the facilities granted by My oldest Ally, Portugal, in herAtlantic islands. Over Germany itself our Air Forces are striking increasinglyheavy blows at the heart of the enemy, in the face of the most desperate opposition.Throughout Europe a mounting tide of resistance is rising against the oppressor.In the Mediterranean resounding victories have been won. The enemy hasbeen driven from the soil of Africa; Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica have beenliberated; the Italian fleet is in our hands; one-third of Italy has been occupied;and My troops and those of the United States confront the foe on the mainlandof Europe. The Italian people&apos;s repudiation of their false leader and their readiness to strike against their German oppressors have shaken the guiltyconfederacy of our enemies to its foundation.It was a special pleasure to Me to visit My Navies, Armies and Air Forcesin the midst of these memorable operations and Myself to witness their courageand ardour.I continue with My people to watch with admiration the increasing successesof the armies of our heroic Russian Allies, and rejoice with them in the liberation of great regions from the ravages of our common foe.In the Far East the advance of the enemy has been halted and the offensiveof the United Nations has begun. I trust that this may soon bring some relief to our Chinese Allies, whose long struggle against the Japanese invader hasinspired our deepest sympathy. In South-East Asia a new Command has been created and new Commanders appointed. In the Western Pacific freedom hasalready been restored to some of the islands which were overrun by the enemy.I look forward to the day when we shall, with God&apos;s help, restore to all my peoples the blessings of peace and progress.
These successful operations in all theatres of war have been sustained andsupplied by the untiring efforts of the men and women working in the industries and services essential to the prosecution of the war in the great manufacturing industries, in agriculture, in the mines, and in transport by land and by sea..For the third successive year we have been blessed with a bounteous harvest.The splendid courage and determination of My merchant seamen and thoseof the United Nations, and of the men of the fishing fleets, with the untiring aid of the minesweepers, have continued to assure the flow of supplies essential tothe prosecution of the war and to the life of My peoples.-1 have also watched with pride the fortitude and endurance shown by those whose duties, though no less necessary, are less directly concerned with theactivities of war the women at home, so many of whom combine their domesticduties with other work, and the men and women working; in the industriessupplying the essential civil needs of My people.The perseverance and industry of My people in the United Kingdom hasbeen emulated by My peoples in My Dominions and Colonial territories and inIndia. I trust that the special hardships which the war has lately brought tomany among My Indian subjects will be relieved; and that the steps my government have already taken will assist the Governments in India in relieving the grave shortage of food in certain areas of India.The unity of My peoples with those of My Allies has continued to heartenour friends and confound our enemies. Once again we have had the advantageof the wise counsel of My Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa; and several of My Ministers from other Dominions have also been able to visit us,with beneficial results. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs has visitedMy Dominion of Canada and Newfoundland; and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies has recently returned from a visit to My territories in East and west Africa. We have been happy to welcome here many distinguished membersof the United States Administration.Matters of great import for the future of the United Nations and of freedom-loving peoples everywhere have been considered at international dis-cussions; and My Ministers here have welcomed the opportunity of exploratory conversations on the future of civil air transport with representatives from MyCommonwealth and Empire.The Treaty for the abolition of extra-territorial rights has been successfullyconcluded with My Chinese Ally. In the summer we had the pleasure ofwelcoming Dr. T. V. Soong, the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, on a brief visit, which unhappily was overshadowed - by the death of the ChinesePresident, Dr. Lin Sen.My Government have welcomed the establishment of the French Committeeof National Liberation at Algiers, and have recognised it as the body qualified to ensure the. conduct of the French effort in the war within the framework of inter-Allied co-operation. We look forward with the Committee to the liberation of France and her restoration to the ranks of the Great Powers.Members of the House of Commons,I thank you for the provision that you have made towards the cost of thewar. The ready support given by My people to the measures you have adoptedhas ensured that the very heavy expenditure required by the war has been met with due regard to the social and economic interests of My country.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, ;It is a matter of especial satisfaction to The Queen and Myself that parliament has complied with My request that the Regency Act should be soamended ,&apos;as to enable Our beloved daughter Princess Elizabeth, when she attainsthe age of eighteen, to serve as one of the Counsellors of State should occasionarise for their appointment.
I have given My Assent to a number of measures which have been brought before you during the course of the year. These have included Acts providingfor the reorganisation of My Foreign Service, for strengthening public controlover the planning of town and country, and for the development of hydro-electric power in Scotland. Legislation has been passed to introduce a new systemof taxation of wages and salaries, which will be of substantial convenience toall employees, particularly those whose earnings&apos; are liable to fluctuation.An Act has been passed to facilitate electoral registration under war conditions.Provision has been made for the development of the catering trades and for regulating the conditions of employment in those trades, for improving theadministration of pensions, and for further temporary increases in the rates of workmen&apos;s compensation.Steps have also been taken to establish machinery for dealing with questionsof wages and conditions in the coal-mining industry.My Government have taken the necessary action to ratify the InternationalLabour Conventions concerning the Regulation of Written Contracts ofEmployment of Indigenous Workers and Penal Sanctions for Breaches of contracts of Employment by Indigenous Workers.With you, I thank Almighty God for having brought us victoriously through a year of peril and anxiety, and. I pray that His blessing may attend you at all.times.

Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.Wednesday, 24th November, 1943.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,In the fourth year of war the Forces of the United Nations assumed the offensive in all theatres of war. The enemy has been cast out of Africa;freedom has been brought to Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica; and in Italy My forces and those of My American Ally are now engaging the enemy on the mainland ofEurope. On his eastern front the enemy has given ground before the massive andunrelenting advance of the Russian Armies, whose magnificent achievements wehave watched with ever-deepening admiration. The captive peoples of Europeare everywhere preparing to throw off the yoke of the oppressor; and we shall continue to afford them such help and encouragement as lies in our power. Onthe frontier of India and in the Pacific, Japanese aggression has been halted, andthe Forces of the United Nations are now moving to the offensive. At sea MyNavies and those of our Allies continue to maintain their mastery over the enemy,and important successes have been won in the struggle against the enemy&apos;sU-boats. The Air Forces of the United Nations have, maintained their ascendancyin all theatres of war, and have increased the weight of their blows at the enemy&apos;sheart.The mounting scale of our offensive is the fruit of the devoted anduntiring efforts of My peoples throughout the Commonwealth and Empire; andin the coming year we shall, with God&apos;s help, be able to bring to bear upon theenemy a still greater weight of attack. With the growing help of our greatAmerican Ally, and together with the other United Nations, we shall go forward with confidence in our cause until we have delivered the peoples of the worldfrom the fear of the aggressor.My Government, taking counsel with My Allies and building upon the foundations laid at the recent Conference in Moscow, will devote continuousattention, to the study of plans for the future settlement of Europe.Members of the House of Commons,You will be asked to make further financial provision for the conduct of thewar and for the other necessary services.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,My Government willcontinue to concentrate their powers and energies uponthe prosecution of the war; and, until final victory is won, that will be their primary task. You will be invited to pass such further legislation as may benecessary to provide for the needs of the war and to meet abnormal conditionsarising from the war.At the same time My Ministers are resolved that, so far as the future canbe foreseen, they shall be ready to meet the different tasks that await them whenvictory has been won. They have undertaken a special review of the problems which are likely to arise as hostilities in Europe come to an end and of the adiust-ments which will have to be made when we turn to prosecute with freshvigour the war against Japan; and in the months to come My Ministers will complete their provisional plans for the period of transition through whichwe must pass before the troubled times of war give place to settled conditions ofpeace. It will be the primary aim of My Government to ensure that in this periodfood, homes and employment are provided for My people, that good progress ismade with the rebuilding of our damaged cities, and that in industry, mining and agriculture a smooth transition is made from Avar to peace. For some of these purposes fresh powers will be needed; and., as the preparations proceed, proposalsfor the necessary legislation will be laid before you. You will, in the immediatefuture, be asked to make provision for the training and employment of disabled persons, and to.amend the law regarding the reinstatement in their civil emplov-ment of persons discharged from the Armed Forces.
in certain fields it is already possible to look beyond the transitional period and to frame proposals for social reforms designed to confer lasting benefits on My people.A measure embodying My Government&apos;s proposals for the reconstruction of the national system of education in England and Wales will be laid before you.An Advisory Council is now preparing reports which are expected to form thebasis for educational developments in Scotland.My Ministers will present to you their views and proposals regarding an enlarged and unified system of social insurance, a comprehensive health serviceand a new scheme of workmen&apos;s compensation; and they will decide, in the lightof your discussions, what specific proposals for legislation on these matters canbe brought forward at this stage.You will be invited to pass legislation conferring special powers for there-development of areas which, by reason of enemy action, over-crowding orotherwise, need to be re-planned       whole.My Government will lay before you the results of their examination of theReports which have been made recommending the assumption of further powersto control and direct the use of the land of Great Britain.It is the desire of My Government that full consideration should be givento various proposals which have been put forward for changes in the existingfranchise law, and you will be invited to give your early attention to this question.My Ministers will maintain and develop the measures for promoting the health and well-being of My people which, by God&apos;s providence, have been sosuccessful during the past four years of war.I pray that the Almighty may give His blessing to your counsels.
