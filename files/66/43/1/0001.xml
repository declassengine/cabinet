(43) 387), and the later draft forwarded bythe United States Ambassador (Annex B in W.P. (43) 405).2.   The first draft was on the following lines : (1) It contemplated early publication.(2) It set out in detail the various aids and facilities given by the UnitedStates to Eire during the course of the war.(3) It dealt fully with the various manifestations of Eire&apos;s neutrality whichhad created great disadvantages for, and given serious offence to,the American people.(4) It urged the Irish people now to take their share in contributing to theAllied victory by eliminating Axis agencies and leasing bases forthe protection of the Atlantic supply lines.(5) It called on Eire to play her part in the post-war future in friendship and association with the Allies.3.   The later draft was on the following lines : (1) It was intended to be a strictly confidential communication.(2) It summarised Mr. de Valera&apos;s statement of December 1941, referring to Ireland&apos;s appreciation of American friendship, and PresidentRoosevelfs reply of the same period.(3) It gave a brief summary of American aid to Eire and of German injuriesto Eire.(4) It referred to the part taken in the war by men of Irish descent inAmerica and in the British Commonwealth.(5) It asked the Government of Eire to grant permission for the use of air and naval facilities in Eire to United States forces if required,and added that these might not be needed.(6) It stated that&apos; any agreement to afford such facilities would be keptstrictly secret.4. The second is a much weaker document, it puts forward the request forbases as a contingency only, and it does not ask Eire to break with the Axis.5. The first is a strong indictment intended for publication and for showingup the Eire Government. The other is a confidential and mild request to- the eire Government for help.c.Dominions Office, 3rd November, 1943.[26361-2]
