(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS. BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEBNJaESNT) 1SJ5 C R E T, -P.(45) 550. COPY NO, 5/f24th November, 1945.WAR   CABINETLONDON AIRFIELD FOR TRMSPORT SERVICES.^0i^^LJ^]^^^SlSi^SL^f State for Scotland.I have read with interest the report dated 12th November 1943(W.P.(43) 517) by the Lord President of the Council and the related memorandadealing with the proposed London airfield for transport services,     While I haveno criticism to offer on the report, it will be appreciated that Prestwiok isat present the main terminus in this country for trans-Atlantic services, andI assume that the adoption of the report will in no way prejudice the developmentof Prestwick after the war as a major international airport.Prestwick is capable of considerable extension which would make itusable by the larger aircraft of the future, while its strategic situation and freedom from fog are valuable advantages.     An additional airport for the countryis no doubt necessary, but any suggestion that the sole British airport for post-war use by the trans-Atlantic service should be situated near London would further accentuate the gx-ave difficulties arising from the undue concentration of industry in the Home Counties, to say nothing of the loss entailed inabandoning an already efficient airport on which millions of public money havebeen spent.T .
