THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Wot Cabinet.   December 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 537.3rd December, 1943Copy No.WAR CABINET.POST AVAR  CIVIL  AVIATION.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.I submit to my colleagues a Paper which was presented to the Civil air transport Committee in draft form at their meeting on Thursday, the2nd December, 1943. and was given unanimous approval.B.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,3rd December, 1943.1. The proposals put forward by the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Aircraft Production in their paper W.P. (43) 532 are excellent. Butthey are inadequate.   Six years must elapse before the airplane comes into use.2. For this reason the project does not help us to deal with Civil aviation at the end of the War.3. We need aircraft now, suitable for carrying passengers, mail and cargoon the Atlantic range, and over the mainline routes of Empire. We must parallelthe American Douglas C-54A and the C-54B. The C-54A is now carrying loadsof more than 6,000 lb. over the Atlantic.   The C-54B will carry 9,000 lb.4. I therefore recommend that design and construction of the Tudor beundertaken forthwith. This aircraft, which is a civil version of the Lancaster IVbomber, could, payload of 6,000 lb. on the Atlantic range.5. The York will not suit our necessities. It cannot make an Atlanticflight against high winds; and fuselage tanks installed to give extra range willdamage the payload, reducing it to 4,000 lb. That is less than half of the loadcarried by the C-54B.6. The choice that must now be made should be understood. It is betweenhaving or abandoning British Civil Aviation after the War. On this we must take our decision. If we cannot provide the machines, we cannot establish theservices. The Americans, who will possess suitable machines, will capture the traffic. And oncfe their aircraft, ground organisation, repair services and equip-ment are installed, we will find it impossible to oust them.7. It may be argued that we should negotiate for American types of civil aircraft. Were we-to obtain these, any system we set up would not be Britishaviation. Nor would we be permitted to secure an American type until the americans had developed a better type for their own use.8. We cannot give a lead to the Dominions unless we are in a position tosupply British airplanes with British engines.9. If we fail to provide British aircraft and British engines for theDominions at the end of the War, then the leadership of air routes in the Empiremust pass to the United States.[26528]
