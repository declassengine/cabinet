During the same night an attempt was made by an Italian A/S boatwith two R.N. officers on board to recover prisoners of war from a beach north ofPescara on the Italian Adriatic coast. The boat was sunk by gunfire from the shore, but five days later the officers returned to Termoli by schooner with nine menand one prisoner of war.Levant.8. Considerable loading and movement eastward of small enemy assaultcraft in the JEgean has been reported during the week by reconnaissance aircraft.H.M. and Allied destroyers have carried out numerous sweeps without result.H.M. S/M Seraph sank three caiques and a seaplane on the 7th.H.M.S. Rockwood (destroyer) was damaged during an air attack when offStampalia on the 9th and was taken in tow.9. The landing of personnel and stores at Leros has continued fromdestroyers, submarines and M.Ls. On the night of the 4th/5th an MG. battalionand 80 tons of stores were landed. -Pacific.10. On the night of the lst/2nd the U.S. naval force covering the landing on Bougainville Island engaged a Japanese force consisting of two heavy cruisers,two light cruisers and eight destroyers which had sailed from Rabaul to attack the Allied shipping. In the ensuing action an enemy light cruiser and four destroyers were sunk, and two cruisers and two destroyers damaged. TheJapanese force broke off the action and retired to Rabaul. All the U.S. shipssustained damage.
On the 4th, a Japanese force of five heavy and three light cruisers, fivedestroyers, and four transports, was sighted north of New Hanover (BismarckArchipelago) steering for Rabaui. On the following day they were attacked by .S. aircraft (see Air Situation) and a heavy cruiser was sunk.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. Nineteen attacks on U-boats have been, reported during the week.Eleven of these were made by ships, seven by shore-based aircraft, and one by acarrier-borne aircraft,U.S. naval aircraft on the 5th sank a U-boat south-west of Ascension Island.On the following day two U-boats were sunk in mid-Atlantic by ships of an escort group, one by ELM. sloops Woodcock and Starling, assisted by an aircraft from. IT.M.S. Tracker (escort carrier), and another by Wild Goose and Starling.An aircraft based on the Azores possibly sank a U-boat on the 9th which hadintercepted a homebound convoy west of Portugal; before dawn on the following-day a Wellington possibly sank one in the approaches to the Bay of Biscay; fivedinghies were observed making for the Spanish coast. A U-boat was probably damaged by cannon-fire from a Mosquito off St. Nazaire on the 6th. Light coastalforces on the 3rd east of Corsica possibly damaged a U-boat which later tookrefuge in the Italian harbour of San Stefano.Enemy Intelligence.German.12. Bad weather has interfered with the reconnaissance of the northernfiords during the week, but it is believed that there are eight to ten destroyers inthe Altenfiord area.The Hipper was imported at Pillau (Gulf of Danzig) on the 30th, apparentlypaid off.Japanese.13. Photographs taken at Rabaul on the 2nd show a new type of Japanesecruiser (believed to be of the Agano class) probably mounting 8-in. guns.U-boats.14. The majority of the U-boats at sea are concentrated to the east of new foundland, but no attacks on shipping have been reported.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15.   No attacks are reported to have been made during the week by U-boats.The Dutch s.s. Marnix van St. Aldegonde (19,355 tons) and a U.S. ship inan eastbound convoy off Philippeville were sunk by aircraft using glider bombs and torpedoes.   The U.S. destroyer Beatty was also sunk.Two ships in a northbound coastal convoy were torpedoed by E-boats off the norfolk coast but reached port.A French ship was mined off Cape Bon on the 7th and was beached.. 16. Shipping losses by enemy action during October were 107,120 tons,the fourth lowest monthly total of the war. If marine losses are added it becomes the second lowest total of losses from all causes. Fourteen ships(68,000 tons) were sunk by U-boats, five ships (26,000 tons) by aircraft, and four ships (13,000 tons) by mine. Nine ships (44,000 tons) were sunk in the Atlantic,six ships (26,000 tons) in the Indian Ocean, seven ships (30,000 tons) in theMediterranean, and one ship (7,000 tons) in the Pacific.17. The tonnage of new ships built for the United Nations during the warnow exceeds the tonnage lost from all causes including marine risk. TheUnited States built about 74 per cent, of the total, the United Kingdom20 per cent, and Canada 6 per cent.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 6th, 855 ships were convoyed. Of these,329 ships were in ocean convoys and 526 in British coastal convoys. One escortcarrier, two A/A ships, 62 destroyers and 99 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes (including 12 US. cutters) were employed on escort duties.Five ocean convoys, consisting of 206 ships, arrived in Home Waters. one ship was lost.[26402] - B
19. During October, 16 ocean convoys of 710 ships arrived in the UnitedKingdom without loss, and one convoy, originally of 39 ships, lost one ship.Fourteen outward convoys of 590 ships reached their destinations without loss,and two convoys, originally of 88 ships, lost six before arrival. One ship was lostduring the month by an attack on an inward convoy still at sea at the end of themonth.In the Western Atlantic and Caribbean 1,705 ships were convoyed in 149convoys; two ships of one convoy were lost.British Minelaying.20. Mines were laid by surface craft in the Channel and off the dutch coast, and by aircraft in the Kattegat, off the Frisian Islands and off the biscay ports.Aircraft also laid mines in the Dodecanese.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.21. There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft during theweek.   E-boats are suspected to have laid mines on two nights off the East Coast.The mine totals are : 4,566 ground and 3,540 moored, destroyed.The Adriatic ports of Bari and Barletta were closed on the 7th aftersuspected minelaying by aircraft.Enemy Merchant Shipping.22. During the period 1st to 15th October, 47 enemy ships, totalling95,806 tons, have been sunk or captured, and three ships, totalling 19,291 tons,have been seriously damaged. All except three ships, totalling 10,743 tons, havebeen sunk, captured or handed over in the Mediterranean.There has been some traffic in iron ore between Bilbao and Bayonne duringthe week.The Spanish s.s. San Sebastian (3,024 tons), which was intercepted on the29th October and taken into Gibraltar, has been seized in prize with her cargo of 5,000 tons of iron ore.Spanish Intelligence.23. The Spanish Fleet is carrying out exercises throughout November off the atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Spain.Representations have been made that the exercises off Ferrol will impedeAllied operations against U-boats.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map is included as an inset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Nevel Sector.24. The Russians have made fresh progress astride the railway Nevei-Polotsk and have reached a point 30 miles south-west of Nevel.Vitebsk Sector.25. The Germans have reported a renewal of Russian attacks north-west ofSmolensk on the 8th, but there has been no confirmation from the Russians.Gomel-Kiev Sector.26. According to an official Russian map published on the 5th, the russians had by that date established a continuous bridgehead, 20 miles deep at some points, across the Dnieper from north of Loev to just north of Kiev. From thisbridgehead the Russians attacked southwards with 13 infantry divisions andthree tank corps, first cutting communications from Kiev westwards and thencapturing Kiev itself on the 6th.   Advancing south-westwards, they captured
 9U ^the railway junction of Fastov, 40 miles south-west of Kiev, on the following day:Since then they have widened their bridgehead in this area by advances to thenorth, west and south.Krivoi Rog Sector.27. Although German counter-attacks north of Krivoi Rog have ceased, theRussians have not made any further progress in that area. There has been aslight Russian advance south-west of Dnepropetrovsk, but otherwise the positionin the Dnieper bend has not changed during the week.Lower Dnieper Sector.28. The Russians have now cleared the whole area south of the Dnieperapart from a stretch south of Nikopol, which the Germans are defendingstubbornly. Their advance from Melitopol was made at an average rate of about11 miles a day. By occupying the peninsula south of the Dnieper Estuary theyare now in a position to threaten German shipping from Nikolaev, and that portwill now be of little further use to the enemy.Crimea.29. The Germans have so far succeeded in holding Russian attacks on thePerekop Isthmus. The Russians have made landings both north-east and southof Kerch and have established bridgeheads, where heavy fighting has been taking-place.General.30. The outstanding event of the week has been the capture of Kiev by theRussians and the further advance by which it has been followed. The russians have concentrated strong forces in this area and have made steady progress sincethe fall of the city on the 6th.The recent Russian advance south-west of Nevel is also very important.Although.the actual gain of ground in this area has not been very great, theRussians threaten to outflank the German positions north of Vitebsk and mayforce the enemy to withdraw from there.There is no sign yet of a decision to evacuate the Crimea.Italy.(An outline map is included as an inset.)General.31. The enemy has been forced back on to the defensive positions he has established along the line of the River Sangro through the mountain ranges nearCastel Di Sangro and thence down to his strongly held right flank behind theRiver Garigliano. On its right flank the Eighth Army has made considerable progress against rear guards who have fought hard before falling back to otherstrongly prepared positions. In contrast to this the Fifth Army&apos;s advance hasbeen strongly contested the whole way, and determined counter-attacks have beenmade by the enemy.The administrative position is improving slowly with the development of the ports, the railways and the roads. Rail communication has been established between Naples, Reggio, Cotrone and thence to the &quot; Heel &quot; ports and a fairnumber of locomotives and rolling stock are now working. Naples and the satelliteports are now discharging over 9,000 tons of stores daily, while the &quot; Heel &quot; ports are handling an average of 8,600 tons a day. This shows a considerable improve-ment on previous figures, but the build-up and maintenance of our fighting forces is still a tremendous task.Eighth Army.32. On the Adriatic coastal sector the 78th Division, with armouredsupport, started to move forward on the 4th, having by then established a firmbridgehead across the River Trigno. By the following day Vasto had been captured and we were commanding by fire the lateral road from there runningsouth-west towards Forli.   Forward troops of this division are now overlooking[26402] .     b 2
the River Sangro, and on the 10th they had patrols over the river whichpenetrated to the south-east of Fossacesia but made no contact with the enemy.In the centre British and Imperial troops have advanced some 12 miles inmountainous country. Patrols found Isernia abandoned on the 4th, capturedForli on the 9th and are now some miles beyond Rionero. They hold both endsof the Vasto-Forli road and patrols are clearing the remainder of the road andthe intervening country.Fifth Army.33. On the 5th, Venafro was captured by-U.S. troops and British patrolsentered Minturno without making contact. Since then the enemy has madeheavy and determined counter-attacks, notably on the 6th and 7th when hesuffered severe casualties; all these attacks have been held and beaten off. Thereis no doubt that the enemy is making the utmost effort to hold his right flankfirm and fresh formations have already been identified in this sector.A U.S. Parachute Regiment is covering the Fifth Army&apos;s right flank andis firmly, established north of Fornelli having made good progress over the mountains during the week. On the left British troops captured Galluccio onthe 7th and since then have been consolidating this place against enemy counter-attacks.TEgean Operations.34. The threat to Leros and Samos appears imminent. Two Germanconvoys were reported on the 10th approaching Kalymnos, one from the north-west near Levitha and the other from south-west near Stampalia. The presenceof parachute troops in Athens, where they were reported on the 2nd, constitutesanother probable threat to the islands. Our patrol was evacuated from Naxoson the 5th.   Symi was occupied on the 2nd by 150 Germans.Greece.Summary of Recent Events.35. On the 9th October, a conflict broke out between the two chief resistancegroups, E.L.A.S. and E.D.E.S. The chief cause appears to have been thatE.L.A.S. suspected E.D.E.S. of collusion with the Germans against them.E.D.E.S. has, in fact, been continuously fighting the Germans, and as E.L.A.S.came to realise this the civil war has gradually died down.The Germans profited by the fighting to reopen the Yannina Trikkalaroad, which had been closed by the guerillas since April. E.L.A.S. G.H.Q. hasnow ordered this to be cut again. E.L.A.S., though not as active as E.D.E.S.against the Germans, has continued to harass them in several places.Yugoslavia.Summary of Recent Events.36. After the Italian Armistice, Tito&apos;s Partisans established themselves onSlovenia and Istria, and large forces of the German command for Northern Italyare being employed to regain control of this area.The Partisans have also occupied long stretches of the coast, and the enemygarrisons in the main ports are isolated. The Partisans control almost all theoutlying islands. For the last fortnight the Germans have been trying to drivethe Partisans off the Peljesac peninsula, but have met with strong resistance.Partisan forces have established themselves in Montenegro and are now-crossing in to Serbia. These areas were formerly held by Mihailovic forces, whohave had the worst of clashes with the invading Partisans and are tending toside with the Germans in the areas where these clashes have occurred.Mihailovic&apos;s operations against the enemy have been confined to minorsabotage activity owing to his anxiety to avoid reprisals and to conserve his forces.The main railway from Central Europe to Sofia and Salonika has been several times cut by the Partisans, and considerable German forces, aided byCroat and Bulgarian units, have had to be detailed to protect it. Most of theother railways throughout the country are either permanently cut or operating under continual attacks.
Burma.37. Reports have been received that a new Japanese division has recentlybegun to arrive in Burma. As yet this division has not been identified, butparts of it may be located in the Pegu-Rangoon area.In Arakan there has been increased patrol activity north of the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road.   Casualties to both sides have, however, been light.In the Chin Hills area the Japanese have occupied Falam. During this advance there have been several encounters with our troops including hand-to-hand fighting, but details are not available.The Chinese troops from Ledo have occupied various villages in the area tothe south of Shingbwiyang.On the Burma-Yunnan border the Japanese now hold the west bank of theSalween River from Lushui (30 miles due east of Htawgaw), southwards to where the old Burma Road crosses the river, near Lungling. There are still no indications that the Japanese intend to cross to the east side of the river.New Guinea.38. In the Finschhafen area, the enemy have made further withdrawalsinland. A further 632 enemy dead have been counted in this area between the23rd and 26th October, making a total of 1,157 since the 17th October.In the Ramu Valley there has been patrol activity only.Solomons.(An outline map is included as an inset.)39. All organised Japanese resistance on Treasury Island (Mono) ceasedon the 4th, after the Japanese had made their final counter-attack on the NewZealand positions. About 80 Japanese dead have been counted. Our casulties are slight.The landing by U.S. Marines at Empress Augusta Bay on the west coast ofBougainville (reported in last week&apos;s Resume) has developed satisfactorily; 135Japanese were killed during the initial stages of landing. The U.S. forces now hold, all the shore of Empress Augusta Bay, except in the north-western end,as well as holding two small islets in the bay. The landing of personnel and stores is proceeding satisfactorily.- On the 6th, a Japanese landing took place to the north of the U.S. positions.Heavy casualties were inflicted on them by air attack.The U.S. landing on Choiseul is now known to have been a diversion. Theoriginal landing was made about 18 miles south-east of Choiseul Bay, which isat the northern end of the island. During the next few days the party movedsouthwards to a point about 55 miles south-east of Choiseui Bay, where theyattacked a Japanese barge staging point. On the 4th they were successfullywithdrawn, having killed 143 Japanese and, destroyed barges and equipment and laid mines and booby traps, for a loss of only 9 killed and 16 wounded.AIR SITUATION.General Review.40. By day, heavy bombers attacked Gelsenkirchen, Minister and. Diiren.Military objectives near the French coast were bombed.On one night, Modane was attacked in strength. Every night, small-scaleraids were made by Mosquitoes on towns in Western Germany.In Italy, harassing attacks were made on enemy lines of communication.Fortresses (B. 17) bombed ball-bearing works at Turin.Unjted Kingdom.41. In daylight, no enemy aircraft were overland. At night, harassing attacks were continued over East Anglia and south and south-east England. A total of54 enemy aircraft crossed our coast, the nightly effort being from five to 20 sorties;in all, 12 raiders were reported over the London area.
In spite of the limited period available for interception due to the short time spent overland by the raiders, seven enemy aircraft were clestroyd, five of whichwere Me. 410s.Home Waters.42.   Beaufighters of Coastal Command, one of which is missing, damaged fourE-boats off Texel.   Aircraft of Fighter Command damaged eight small ships of.various types and two E-boats.   On four nights, aircraft of Bomber Command,of which five are missing from the 94 despatched, laid 175 sea-mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.43. Owing to poor weather conditions, operations were on a moderate scaleduring most of the week. On the 5th, however, over 2,050 offensive sorties were flown by bombers, fighter-bombers and fighters. The main concentrations were onsynthetic oil plants.at Gelsenkirchen and railway junctions at Minister; a total of505 Fortresses (B.17) and Liberators (B.24) were despatched, with support to andfrom the target by 24 squadrons of Thunderbolts (P.47). At Gelsenkirchen, 326Fortresses (B.17) released 667 tons of bombs with results variously reported aspoor to good. A good attack oh Minister was made by 105 Liberators (B.24) and four Fortresses (B.17); 275 tons were dropped. Ten bombers and four fightersdid not return. Enemy fighter casualties were 38 destroyed and 18 probably destroyed.On the 7th, 121 Fortresses (B.17) were despatched in two formations, bothof which were supported to and from their targets by 21 squadrons of Thunder-bolts (P. 47). Diiren was bombed by 57 aircraft of the first formation which dropped 115 tons with poor to good effect. A similar tonnage of bombs was dropped-&apos;by 54 aircraft of the second formation on objectives in western germany but cloud prevented observation of the results. All the bombers returned safely.   One Me.210 was shot down for the loss of six fighters.Escorted Marauders (B.26) dropped a total of 63 tons of bombs on airfields at Chievres and Lille/Vendeville.Military objectives near Calais were bombed on three days by a total of 456escorted light and medium bombers, two of which are missing; over 600 tons were dropped. In some instances cloud precluded observation of results but, in others,a good proportion of bursts was seen in the target areas.Harassing raids, by aircraft operating in pairs, were directed against trans-portation in France and Belgium; at least 40 locomotives were among the targetshit. Attacks were also made on four airfields in France. Fifteen of our aircraftdid not return from these missions.Night.44. On. the 10th/11th, 301 Lancasters (of 313 despatched) delivered a well-concentrated attack on the railway centre at Modane, near the entrance to theMont Cenis Tunnel on the French-Italian frontier. In clear weather, which enabled the target, to be identified visually until obscured by-smoke from the resultant fires, 1,124 tons of bombs were dropped. Photographs show numerousbombs bursting near the International Station. Flak was negligible and no enemy fighters were encountered.   Not one of our bombers is missing.Each night of the week, Bomber Command Mosquitoes raided objectives in western Germany; 87 successful sorties were flown and the same tonnage was dropped. Eleven towns were attacked, some twice, the heaviest efforts falling onLeverkiisen, Bochum, Duisburg and dusseldorf.Fighter Command despatched 82 &quot; intruders &quot;; four are missing. Railwayobjectives, locomotives and airfields were attacked in France and the low countries.Seventy aircraft, including 13 Fortresses (B. 17), were engaged in droppingpropaganda leaflets over territory in enemy occupation.Italy.45. Operations were considerably restricted by unfavourable weather conditions.Light bombers and fighter-bombers were active and made harassing attacks on enemy lines of communications and on targets in the battle area.    Road
bridges were damaged; at least 160 M.T. vehicles and 12 trains or locomotiveswere destroyed or damaged; gun positions were bombed and guns silenced; roadjunctions were attacked and traffic blocks created and bombed. Eleven enemy aircraft were shot down and two Allied fighters are missing from these operations.Four direct hits were made on the viaduct at term  and a tunnel north ofthe town was also hit. At Falconara Marittima (near Ancona) both the railway and road bridge were hit; at Cassino a bridge was probably destroyed; severalattacks were made on bridges near Orbetello (92 miles N.W. of Rome) and damage was caused to a bridge over the Ombrone River north of Grosseto.Over 40 Wellingtons successfully bombed the marshalling yards at Orte(39 miles N. of Rome). Ball-bearing works at Turin were attacked by82 Fortresses (B. 17) which dropped 183 tons of bombs causing severe damage;the railway centre and junction also was hit and five buildings in the FiatMotor and Aero Engine factory were damaged. Liberators (B. 24) released60 tons on the ball-bearing works at Veliaperosa (22 miles W.S.W. of Turin)and Fortresses (B. 17) attacked the Ansaldo steel works at Genoa, but themajority of bombs fell west of the target.&apos; On the night 5th/6th, about 30 enemy bombers attacked Naples harbour,and, on the following evening, 10 enemy aircraft operated against an Alliedconvoy off Cape Bougeron in Algeria and some damage was sustained by our ships.During the week ended the 9th, the North-West African Air Force flew6,184 sorties; 65 enemy aircraft were destroyed and 25 Allied aircraft are missing.Yugoslavia and Albania.46.

During the week, weather conditions in the iEgean were very poor andhampered operations. Beaufighters carried out operations against enemy shipping at Crete, Paros Island, Siphnos Island, Kea Island, Kos and southern Greece. Four medium-sized ships were seriously damaged and at least20 small craft were hit, including tugs, landing barges, caiques and E and-boats. From these operations, nine Beaufighters are missing and twoArados 196s were destroyed.Small-scale attacks, usually in unfavourable weather, were made onAntimachia landing ground (Kos) and the airfield at Maritsa (Crete) and in both instances the runways were hit. Raids were made also on Heraklion (Crete)and Syros harbour, and mines were dropped in the harbours of Calinos and Naxos.Enemy attacks on Leros.were on a small scale; some day and night attacks were made by Ju. 88, not more than 15 operating in any one raid.Russia.48.

A final interpretation of photographs taken on the 30th Octobershows that over 96 per cent, of the property in the fully built up town area hasbeen destroyed. In the less congested residential districts south of the main station, destruction amounts to 48 per cent.Casualties to H.M. Auxiliary Vessels and to Naval Personnel.3rd November.
