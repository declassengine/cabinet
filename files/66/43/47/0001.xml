This document is the property of His Britannic M a j e s t. y&apos; s GovernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, December, 1943MOST secret.P. (43) 5472nd December, 1943.The  circulation  of this   paper   has been strictly   limited.    It   is   issued   for   the personal use of copy No.   34WAR CABINETMILITARY REQUIREMENTS OF FOOD FOR CIVIL affairs memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. I should like to supplement the Minister of State&apos;s memorandum on reliefestimates for food requirements, W.P.(43)529, by a note showing the military positionin this matter.2. The War Office are concerned in the supply of food to the civil populationsolely in order to prevent disease and unrest in areas in which military operations aretaking place or are based, and thus to avoid hindrance to&quot; those operations. Becausesuch areas must necessarily for a time be under the control of the military commander,it has been accepted that the War Office should plan, estimate, demand, procurethrough the recognized channels, and arrange for the distribution of essential food supplies for the civil population for the military area for the military period.In applying this principle the questions arise:  (a) What is the military period ?(6) What are the military areas?(c) On what basis is provision to be made, i.e., how much food is the civil popula-tion, if possible, to be guaranteed?So far as (a) is concerned, there was no alternative but to take an arbitrary period and that period has been taken as six months, it being understood that, as soon as eventspermitted, the military authorities would hand over their responsibilities and the balanceof any accumulated stocks.So far as (b) is concerned, this has obviously to be related to the actual operationsplanned (and therefore as operational plans change, as they have done, requirementschange too). But there is room for difference of opinion whether the military shouldbe concerned only with the areas in which there are troops fighting and securing linesof communications, or whether food for adjacent areas which the enemy have evacuatedshould also be their concern, since if there is civil unrest for lack of food in such areas,it may affect the areas where the troops are, and an influx of civilians from the foodlessareas may be dangerous to military operations and difficult to control. Hitherto wehave worked on the narrower conception.So far as (c) is concerned the ration, during the military period, has been calculated on the basis of 2,000 calories, and provision to ensure that standard has been calculatedafter allowing for the anticipated local supplies in each particular area.3. Working on the lines set out in paragraph 2 the War Office have actually North-Vprovided for North-West Europe an iron ration for 5,000,000 for 42 days and sent Europe,forward, some months ago, through the usual channels to the Combined Food Board in washington, demands for six months&apos; supplies* for the population in the area coveredby the operational plan then in force. The War Office have assumed that consideration at the Combined Food Board would show to what extent the demands could be met without affecting the supplies at present available to U.K., US.A. and other allied countries.Unfortunately progress has been slow. The United States War Department havenot been prepared to accept our figures for the needs during the military period, noruntil the last few days had agreement been reached on the method by which responsibility* Note. Since the demands went forward it has been agreed that the War Office should include inthe six months period the 42 days for which iron rations are provided.
for the procurement of food supplies during the military period should be allocatedbetween the United Kingdom and the United States; we were pressing that no allocationshould be made except by, or with the approval of, the Combined Food Board; theWar Department wished to place orders without reference to that Board. A corn-promise, satisfactory to our Missions in Washington, has just been reached. But thenet result is that no orders have been placed, with the exception of the accumulationhere of a comparatively small quantity of flour, and the manufacture in the U.K. ofspecial vitaminized chocolate.4. Recent events have affected the estimates which we had made of requirements for the military period in North-West Europe. In the first place, alternative plans have had to be prepared to take into account the possibility of a rapid Germanevacuation, which would mean the liberation of territories and their occupation by allied troops more rapidly than the original calculations assumed. Secondly, thequestion has arisen whether, in these circumstances, a wider view of military respon-sibility should be taken than that on which we have hitherto worked, and whetherprovision should cover not only the areas occupied by our advancing troops and theirlines of communication, but the whole of the countries evacuated by the enemy. very rough estimates on the two bases are given in Appendix A. The case for the broaderview is strengthened by the fact that the United States War Department have recentlyfavoured this view and are anxious to start to procure at once supplies for the militaryperiod for the whole of the countries likely to be evacuated by the enemy. Moreover,we have just heard from our delegation to the U.N.R.R.A. Conference at Atlantic Citythat the President has now directed the War Department to look after relief and rehabilitation-tation until other agencies are ready to take over.5. The position as regards North-West Europe, from the military point of view,may therefore, be summarized as follows:  (a) A very small stock of iron rations is available.(b) Although estimates have been put forward to provide for six months for theareas covered by the previous military plan, practically no orders have, infact, been placed. The plan has now changed : the War Department in Wash-ington want to procure supplies for six months for the whole of the relevantcountries in North-West Europe, and the President is reported to have directed^ that they shall accept responsibility, apparently for an unspecified time, in liberated territories everywhere until other agencies can take over.My main concern is that something should be clone at once to procure supplies sothat they may be ready when operations start, and I am prepared, if only to reach an agreement which would enable a start to be made, to accept the War Departmentproposal in paragraph 4 above (the effect of which would be, as far as we can estimate,of the order shown in Column (2) of Appendix A), provided that while the supplies should be ordered and procured through military channels, their handling and distribu-tion should, in the areas where there are no military forces, be undertaken from thefirst by U.N.R.R.A., the indigenous Government, or some civil agency. To throw onthe Army the duty of providing the machinery for feeding the whole of Europe outsidethe actual bases of operations seems to me as at present advised to be a burden which could not be undertaken without diverting their manpower and their effortsfrom the active conduct of the war.6. I understand that the British Food Mission in Washington have already been instructed that procurement of requirements for the military period, when agreed withthe United States War Department, may go forward. I have, therefore, authorizedagreement to the United States War Department proposal so far as procurement for north-West Europe is concerned.7. I should add, by way of explanation, that no useful comparison can be made between the Young/Sinclair figures set out at the end of W.P. (43)529, and the figures in column (2) of Appendix A to this memorandum. The latter relate to certain countries inEurope for which definite operational plans have been made. The Young/Sinclair figures include the requirements of all countries in each of the three calendar periods in accordancewith a General Staff forecast of the course of liberation, made at the beginning of last July.The Young/Sinclair figures for the last six months of 1943 therefore include, e.g., requirements for Italy, a country not included in Appendix A to this memorandum. Even greaterdisparities arise in the figures for 1944.8. As regards planning for the military period in other theatres the position is asfollows : Italy and (a) Italy and Sicily.   Food requirements were calculated in Algiers for the six monthsSicily. ending 31st March, 1944.   These were sent to Washington, and, after someadjustments by the Combined Civil Affairs Committee, were approved and sub-mitted to the Combined Food Board for allocation. The latter has taken place and procurement action is proceeding : the details are set out. in Appendix B.
-1 0 01 O3I must, however, point out that a recent cable from Algiers states that thereis an urgent need for additional immediate shipments of flour to Italy and Sicily.Details of shipments already arranged and en route have been repeated to Algiersin order to make sure whether the existing programme requires to be supple-mented. In the meantime we have been asked by the United States war department whether we could make available the immediate requirements for italy and Sicily from our reserves in the Middle East. I am very reluctant toagree to this because of its effect on our civil affairs preparations for the Balkans.(b) The Balkans. As I recently informed the War Cabinet, arrangements have been Themade to have accumulated by the end of the year in the Middle East sufficient Balkans,foodstuffs to provide for the needs of Greece for six weeks. Arrangements arealso being made which, if undisturbed, should result by the spring in the accumulation in the Middle East of a food reserve sufficient for six weeks forYugoslavia and Albania, as well as Greece. Details are set out in Appendix C.G.H.Q., Middle East, have, however, recently indicated that they regard thepresent programme for building up their six weeks&apos; reserve for the Balkans astoo slow, and think that the planned reserve should be increased. discussions are at present proceeding in Washington on the scale of provision for civil affairs to be adopted for the Balkans, and once this has been agreed it will be necessaryto consider, in consultation with the American authorities, whether additionalprocurement should be initiated so as to increase the size of the Middle Eastreserve.9. The War Cabinet are already aware from their recent discussions (W.M.(43) 155thmeeting) of the political reasons justifying very careful preparations for the provision of adequate foodstuffs for Greece as soon as that country is liberated. To these reasons are nowadded the opinion received from G.H.Q., Middle East, to which I have referred. I consider,therefore, that we should do all we can in the circumstances to prevent the reserve now building up in the Middle East from being drawn upon to meet the requirements of Italy and Sicily.10. I invite the War Cabinet : (a) to take note of the general position as regards food for civil affairs purposes in north-West Europe during the military period, outlined in paragraphs to 7 above ;(b) to agree that while procurement proceeds on the wider basis shown in column(2) of Appendix A, it should be recognized that distribution outside theareas of military occupation must be arranged and handled by civil agenciesor the indigenous governments concerned ;(c) to agree that, except for the most compelling reasons, we should not drawfrom the Middle East reserve now being accumulated for Greece and the balkans in order to meet the requirements of Italy and Sicily.P.

Apart from their different geographical bases the figures in columns (2) and (3) are not strictly comparable, since column (3) was drawn up in London without the economic data used in washington in compiling the figures in column (2).2. Column (2) was drawn up on the basis of the 1943 harvest, whilst column (3) was calculated on the harvest of 1942.3. Chocolate is omitted from column (2) since its provision is still under discussion in Washington.4. An addition of, very approximately, 7 per cent, may have to be made to columns (2) and (3)&apos; in respect of an area not hitherto included in these figures.
