THIS DOCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY OF Hfg BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 504.with November, 1943.WAR CABINETSHIPMENT OF food grains TO INDIA.Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.ON the 24th September the War Cabinet &quot;decided that we should aim atshipping-a total of 200,000 tons of food grains to India by the end of 1943, andthat the position should be reviewed again at the end of the year in the lightof the Indian harvests. It was subsequently arranged that this decision shouldbe implemented by the shipment of 80,000 tons of wheat and wheat flour, almostentirely from Australia, and of up to 130,000 tons of barley from Iraq.2. It is now clear that I must ask the War Cabinet to consider the questionof additional imports without waiting for the end of the year, for the following reasons : (a) The forthcoming Indian rice harvest will not reach the market until january. During the period when the crop is awaited and whenefforts are being made to draw an adequate part of it into govern-mental hands, it is important to give the impression both to the ricecultivators and to the holders of this year&apos;s surplus of Punjab wheatthat, until ample supplies are forthcoming from them, a steady streamof imports will continue. If a decision regarding further imports is delayed until the end of the year, it would come too late to affectloadings in December, January and possibly February, and therewould be a damaging interruption in the flow of arrivals.(b) It is evident from the Viceroy&apos;s report on his recent visit to Bengal thatthe Indian authorities are having great difficulty in holding thesituation there with the supplies of cereals at their disposal. the urgent calls now being made for supplies to Bengal from other partsof India are trenching seriously upon the supplies required for otherdeficit areas, including Bombay and the Malabar States where theneed is also urgent and where, but for the effective action taken bytheir Governments, the situation might have been as sensational asin Bengal.(c) Owing to transportation difficulties in Iraq and the limited capacity ofthe port of Basra, it will not be possible to export from Iraq to india the full programme of 130,000 tons of barley before the end of theyear.(d) There is increasing public pressure in this country for greater assistanceto India by way of the shipment of cereals from overseas. If our refusal of the offer of 100,000 tons of wheat by the Canadian Govern-ment becomes known, it will be desirable to show that adequatequantities of wheat are being shipped instead from other sources.3. The War Cabinet will require the advice of the Minister of War transport as to the amount of shipping which can be made available to load additionalcereals for India. The Government of India&apos;s view is that the minimum thatwill give them a fighting chance (as distinct from a good prospect) of extractingsupplies and restoring confidence is an assurance of 50.000 tons per month for[26364]
212 months and authority to make an announcement that this has been promised.I do not know how far this is practicable. If the War Cabinet are not preparedto commit themselves to a long-term programme of this sort, I hope that at leastthey will agree that- (a) there should be loaded for India from Australia (i) 50,000 tons of wheat before the end of 1943 additional to the80,000 tons referred to in paragraph 1 above, and(ii) 50,000 tons of wheat in January 1944 and a further 50,000 tons inFebruary 1944;(b) the question should be examined how much Iraqi barley can be made avail-able for India after the present programme of 130,000 tons has beencompleted;(c) the position should be examined again in January.L. S. A.India Office, 4th November, 1943.
