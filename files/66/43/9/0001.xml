Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.Tuesday, November 23rd, 1943.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,1. During the past year My peoples and those of My Allies have beenbrought, by God&apos;s providence, to a turning point in their unceasing fight forfreedom. The mounting strength of the United Nations has enabled.them to wrestthe initiative from the enemy and to turn to the offensive in all parts of theworld.2. Our common purpose has been furthered by an ever closer co-operationbetween the United Nations above all especially- between My Governments andthose of our Allies in the United States and the Soviet Union. My Prime minister in the United Kingdom has three times met in conference the President of theUnited States. The Foreign Secretary has recently returned from concerting withM. Molotov and Mr. Cordell Hull plans for the joint conduct of the war and fora united approach to the problems of the transition from war to peace. It is amatter for gratification that the Chinese Government associated themselves with one of the more important instruments resulting from that Conference. Trie-results of this most important meeting in Moscow have brought new hope to all who look to a speedy victory over our enemies and a just and enduring peace..I rejoice in the warmth of the reception accorded to my Ministers in Washington,and Moscow and in the historic city of Quebec in My Dominion of Canada.3. In the various theatres of war throughout the world My Navy, Armyand Air Force have fought in close and continuous fellowship with their comradesfrom My Dominions and India and My Colonial Empire, and with the gallantforces of the United States and My other Allies. Their united efforts have produced solid and striking achievements in every theatre of war.4. The deadly menace of the U-boats continues to be frustrated by ourNavies and Air Forces, whose ever-lengthening tale of successes rejoices all ourhearts. Their task will be notably eased by the facilities granted by My oldestAlly, Portugal, in her Atlantic islands. Over Germany itself our Air Forces arestriking increasingly heavy blows at the heart of the enemy, in the face of the mostdesperate opposition. Throughout Europe a mounting tide of resistance is risingagainst the oppressor.5. In the Mediterranean powerful blows have been struck. The enemy havebeen driven from the soil of Africa; Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica have beenliberated; the best part of the Italian fleet is in our hands; and in Italy the Forcesof the United Nations once more confront the foe on the mainland of Europe. the confederation of our enemies has been shaken to its foundation by the action of the  Italian people in repudiating their false leader and turning against theirGerman oppressors.It was a special pleasure to Me to visit My Navies, Armies and Air Forcesin the midst of these impressive operations and Myself to witness the courage and enthusiasm which have brought these notable successes.6. I continue with My people to watch with admiration the increasing-successes of the armies of our gallant Russian Allies, and rejoice with them inthe liberation of great tracts of territory from the ravages of our common foe.7. In the Far East the advance of the enemy has been halted and the offensive of the United Nations has begun. I trust that this may soon bring somerelief to our Chinese Allies, whose long and bitter struggle against the Japaneseaggressor has inspired our deepest sympathy. In -South-East Asia a newCommand has been created and new Commanders appointed. In the western pacific freedom has already been restored to some of the islands which wereoverrun by the enemy. I look forward to the day when we shall, with God&apos;s help,restore to all My peoples who are still oppressed the blessings of peaceful andordered progress.
28. These successful operations in all theatres of war have been sustained,and supplied by the untiring efforts of the men and women working in theindustries and services essential to the prosecution of the war in the greatmanufacturing industries, in agriculture, in the mines, and in transport by land and by sea.9. The splendid courage and determination of My merchant seamen andthose of the United Nations, and of the men of the fishing fleets, have continued,to assure the flow of supplies essential to the prosecution of the war and to the.life of My peoples. For the third successive year we have been blessed with abounteous harvest.10.   I have also watched with pride the fortitude and endurance shown by&quot;those whose duties, though no less necessary, are less directly concerned with theactivities of war the women at home, so many of whom combine their domesticduties with other work, and the men and women working in the industriessupplying the essential civil needs of My people.11. The perseverance and industry of My people in the United kingdom has been emulated by My peoples in My Dominions and Colonial territories andin India. I trust that the special hardships which the war has lately broughtto many among My Indian subjects will be assuaged; and that the steps my government have already taken will assist the Governments in India in relieving the grave shortage of food in certain areas of India.12. The unity of My peoples with those of My Allies has continued tohearten our friends and confound our enemies. Once again we have had theadvantage of the wise counsel of My Prime Minister of the Union of SouthAfrica; and several of My Ministers from other Dominions have also been ableto visit us, with fruitful results. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairshas visited my Dominion of Canada and Newfoundland; and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies has recently returned from a fruitful visit to My territories in East. - and &quot;West Africa. We have been happy to welcome here manydistinguished members of the United States Administration.13. Matters of great import for the future of the United Nations and of freedom-loving peoples everywhere have been considered at international dis-cussions; and My Ministers here have welcomed the opportunity of exploratory conversations on the future of civil air transport with representatives from MyCommonwealth and Empire.14. The Treaty for the abolition of extra-territorial rights has been successfully concluded with My Chinese Ally. In the summer we had the pleasureof welcoming Dr. T. V. Soong, the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, on a brief visit, which unhappily was overshadowed by the death of the ChinesePresident. Dr. Lin Sen.15. My Government have welcomed the establishment of the french committee of National Liberation at Algiers, and have recognised it as the bodyqualified to ensure the conduct of the French effort in the war within the frame-work of inter-Allied co-operation. We look forward with the Committee to the liberation of France and her restoration to the ranks of the Great Powers.Members of the House of Commons,16. I thank you for the provision that you have made towards the cost ofthe war. The ready support given by My people to the measures you haveaxlopted has ensured that the very heavy expenditure required by the war has been met with due regard to the social and economic interests of My country.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, .17.   It is a matter of especial satisfaction to The Queen and Myself that parliament has complied with My request that-the Regency Act should be so. amended as to enable Our beloved daughter Princess Elizabeth, when she attainsthe age of eighteen, to serve as one of the Counsellors of State should occasionarise for their appointment.18. I have given My Assent to a number of measures which have beenbrought before you during the course of the year. These have included Actsproviding for the reorganisation of My Foreign Service, for strengthening public
control over the planning of town and country, and for the development of hydro-electric power in Scotland. Legislation has been passed to introduce a new systemof taxation of wages and salaries, which will be of substantial convenience toall employees, particularly those whose earnings are liable to fluctuation.Provision has been made to facilitate electoral registration under war conditions.Provision has been made for the development of the catering trades and for regulating the conditions of employment in those trades, for improving theadministration of pensions, and for further temporary increases in the rates of workmen&apos;s compensation.19. Steps have also been taken to establish machinery for dealing with questions of wages and conditions in the coal-mining industry.20. My Government have taken the necessary action to ratify the Inter-national Labour Conventions concerning the Regulation of Written Contracts ofEmployment of Indigenous Workers and Penal Sanctions for Breaches of contracts of Employment by Indigenous Workers.21. With you, I thank Almighty God for having brought us through a year of peril and anxiety, and I pray that His blessing may attend you at all times.

Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.Wednesday, 24th November, 1943.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,1. In the fourth year of war the Forces of the United Nations have assumed the offensive in all theatres of war. The enemy has been cast out of Africa;freedom has been brought to Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica; and in Italy My forces and those of My American Ally are now engaging the enemy on the mainland ofEurope. On his eastern front the enemy has given ground before the massive andunrelenting advance of the Russian Armies, whose magnificent achievements wehave watched with ever-deepening admiration. The captive peoples of Europeare everywhere preparing to throw off the yoke of the oppressor; and we shall continue to afford them such help and encouragement as lies in our power. Onthe frontier of India and in the Pacific, Japanese aggression has been halted, andthe Forces of the United Nations are now moving to the offensive. At sea MyNavies and those of our Allies continue to maintain their mastery over the enemy,and important successes have been won in the struggle against the enemy&apos;s(J-boats. The Air Forces of the United Nations have maintained their ascendancyin all theatres of war, and have increased the weight of their blows at the enemy&apos;sheart.2. The mounting scale of our offensive is the fruit of the devoted anduntiring efforts of My peoples throughout the Commonwealth and Empire; andin the coming year we shall, with God&apos;s help, be able to bring to bear upon theenemy a still greater weight of attack. With the growing help of our greatAmerican Ally, and together with the Other United Nations, we shall go forward with confidence in our cause until we have delivered the peoples of the worldfrom the fear of the aggressor.My Government will devote continuous attention, taking counsel with MyAllies and building upon the sure foundations laid at the recent Conference in moscow-, to the study of plans for the future settlement of Europe.Member of the House of Commons.3. You will be asked to make further financial provision for the conduct ofthe war and for the other necessary services.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,4. My Government will continue to concentrate their powers and energiesupon the prosecution of the war; and until final victory is won, that will be their primary task. You will be invited to pass such further legislation as may benecessary to provide for the needs of the war and to meet abnormal conditionsarising from the war.5. At the same time My Ministers are resolved that, so far as the future canbe foreseen, they shall be ready to meet the different tasks that await them whenvictory has been won. They have undertaken a special review of the problems which are.likely to arise as hostilities in Europe come to an end and of the adjust-ments which will have to be made when we turn to prosecute with freshvigour the war against Japan; and in the months to come My Ministers will complete their provisional plans for the period of transition through whichwe must pass before the troubled times of war give place to settled conditions ofpeace. It will be the primary aim of My Government to ensure that in this periodfood, homes and employment are provided for My people, that good progress ismade with the rebuilding of our damaged cities, and that in industry, mining and agriculture a smooth transition is made from war to peace. For some of these purposes fresh powers will be needed; and, as the preparations proceed, proposalsfor the necessary legislation will be laid before you. You will, in the immediatefuture, be asked to make provision for the training and employment of disabled persons, and to amend the law.regarding the reinstatement, in their civil employ-ment of persons discharged from the Armed Forces.
26. In certain fields it is already possible to look beyond the transitional period and to frame proposals for social reforms designed to confer lasting benefits on My people.7. A measure embodying My Government&apos;s proposals for the reconstruction of the national sj^stem of education in England and Wales will be laid before you.An Advisory Council is now preparing reports which are expected to form thebasis for educational developments in Scotland.8. My Ministers will present to you their views and proposals regarding an enlarged and unified system of social insurance, a comprehensive health serviceand a new scheme of workmen&apos;s compensation; and they will decide, in the lightof your discussions, what specific proposals for legislation on these matters canbe brought forward at this staff.9. You will be invited to pass legislation conferring special powers for there-development of areas which, by reason of enemy action, over-crowding orotherwise, need to be re-planned as a whole.My Government will lay before you the results of their examination of theReports which have been made recommending the assumption of further powersto control and direct the use of the land of Great Britain.10. It is the desire of My Government that full consideration should be givento various proposals which have been put forward for changes in the existingfranchise law, and you will be invited to give your early attention to this question.11. My Ministers will maintain and develop the measures for promoting the health and well-being of My people.which, by God&apos;s providence, have been sosuccessful during the past four years of war.12.   I pray that the Almighty may give His blessing to your counsels.
