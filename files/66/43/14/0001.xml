THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 514.11th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN ORGANISATION FOR CIVIL AFFAIRS in liberated AND CONQUERED A.REAS.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on armistice terms and Civil Administration.History.1. IN June 1942 an Interdepartmental Committee (A.T. (E) ) was set up under War Office chairmanship to plan for civil administration in areas of Europelikely to be liberated or conquered by operations launched from this country.From the end of July 1942 there were American representatives on this Com-mittee, drawn from Headquarters ETOUSA and the United States Embassy,but the State and War Departments have never recognised this Committee as having any real combined status.2. Since the North African theatre was primarily an American respon-sibility, we did not initiate in London any Civil Affairs planning for this theatre.Nor, as it later appeared, did the Americans. Consequently, considerable difficulties arose in dealing with matters of civil administration and supply in french North Africa.3. The United States War Department, as a result of this experience, setup a Civil Affairs Division in March 1943, and proposed to us that a CombinedCivil Affairs Committee should be set up in Washington to advise the combined chiefs of Staff on civil affairs matters in all combined theatres of operations. Wewere reluctant to agree to this proposal, since there were obvious disadvantages in planning, in Washington rather than in London, the civil administration ofEurope and of British territories in enemy occupation. After considerable dis-cussion with the Americans, we agreed in June 1943 to the setting up of the combined Civil Affairs Committee in Washington, whose functions included the drawing up of armistice terms, the establishment of control commissions, theprovision of the necessary supplies for civil populations and the consideration ofall the problems concerning local administration which might be presented by the theatre Commander. We secured in the Charter, of the Combined Committee a reference to the AT. (E) Committee which we thought at the time would permit the bulk of civil affairs planning for operations in Europe to take place inLondon. We also reached, agreement on a formula to regulate the policy to befollowed in British territories. The Committee in Washington consists of repre-sentatives of the United States Army, United. States Navy and United StatesState Department, the British Embassy and the Joint Staff Mission.4. We agreed to the establishment in Washington of the Combined civil affairs Committee, because virtually all the combined machinery had been located in Washington, and because we are more willing and able to work by delegationthan the Americans. Also Civil Affairs, following hard on the heels of militaryoperations, were expected to be matters which concerned primarily the militaryauthorities, and therefore the Combined Chiefs of Staff seemed to be the onlysuitable organisation under which these matters could be properly co-ordinated.Arguments for a Combined Civil Affairs Committee in London.5. But the questions which arise in connection with civil administrationhave not merely operational implications, but are largely of an administrative[26394]
and political nature. They are in fact primarily matters for the Governmentsconcerned rather than for Combined Chiefs of Staff. If therefore there aredefinite advantages (as paragraph 7 shows that there are) in making Londonrather than Washington the centre for combined planning of Civil Affairs, thefact that the Combined Chiefs of Staff are in Washington does not seem to be aninsuperable obstacle. It Would still be possible to keep the Combined Chiefs ofStaff fully informed on all matters which are of definite interest to them, and torefer such matters to them for their decision.8. We have been considering1 the procedure for handling the Civil Affairsquestions which will arise as the result of the invasion of the Continent across theChannel, or from the south. These questions will arise in countries whose exiledGovernments are situated in London or the Middle hast, and also in Germanyand her satellites. Especially difficult problems will arise in the case of France.Although military requirements in these areas will be paramount during theperiod of operations, there is no doubt that the majority of questions which will arise on Civil Affairs will have to be determined by the Governments concernedrather than by the Chiefs of Staff.7. We have reached the conclusion that the combined machinery for planning and executing Civil Affairs in Europe should be centred in London forthe following reasons :  (a) As  a   result of  the  Moscow  Conference  the  Tripartite  european advisory Commission will be established in London. This Corn-mission will study and make joint 7&apos;recommendations to the three governments upon European questions connected with the termina-tion of hostilities such as the terms of surrender to be imposed uponeach of the European States and the machinery required to ensurethe fulfilment of those terms;(b) The exiled Governments of Belgium, Holland and Norway are situated-&apos; in London, and of Jugoslavia and Greece in Middle East, operations from which are a British responsibility;(c) The planning of i; Overlord &quot;&apos; is being done in London and the supreme allied Commander who will be responsible for Civil Affairs in north-Western  hurope has his Headquarters here.8. We therefore propose that there should be established in London a combined Civil Affairs Committee on which would be represented the ForeignOffice,, the War Office, the United States State, War and Navy Departments.This Committee should consist mainly of officials, but its composition can beleft to be worked out after discussion with the Americans. It would be thefocus for all Civil Affairs questions (other than supply) pertaining to Europe.It would make recommendations to the United Kingdom and United states government on political and administrative matters. Where operational con-siderations are involved, it would report to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Onall Civil Affairs matters in Europe (other than supply) the Combined Chiefsof Staff would refer to the London Committee for advice rather than to theWashington Committee. Instructions to Theatre Commanders resulting fromthe recommendations of the London Committee would continue to be issued bythe Combined Chiefs of Staff.9. We propose to exclude supply questions from the scope of the LondonCommittee but&quot; the Departments concerned are considering whether there shouldnot also be set up in London another Combined Committee for supply questions at the official level. If such a Committee were set up it would make recom-mendations to the Combined Boards in Washington.Should the London Committee cover British Territories in the Far East?10. We have so far dealt with the Combined Civil Affairs machinery&apos; for europe, but it is also necessary to consider arrangements to be made for british territories in South-East Asia and the Pacific.11. The present position is that the jurisdiction of the existing CombinedCivil Affairs Committee in Washington is world-wide; though after long discus-sion we secured the insertion of the following clause in its Charter in order to preserve our position in British territories in enemy occupation :  &quot; When an enemy-occupied territory of the United States, the UnitedKingdom or one of the Dominions is to be recovered as the result of an
operation combined or otherwise, the military directive to be given theForce Commander concerned will include the policies to be followed in the handling of civil affairs as formulated by the Government which exercisedauthority over the territory before enemy occupation. If paramount military requirements as determined by the Force Commander necessitate a departure from those policies, he will take action and report through the Chiefs ofStaff to the Combined Chiefs of Staff.&quot;12. The above, represented the best we could obtain &quot;at the time, but theposition is clearly unsatisfactory since, whilst we admit that on operationalgrounds there may be good reason for the Combined Chiefs of Staff to considerthe Civil Affairs policy to be followed in a British territory, we see no reason whythat policy should go before the Combined Civil Affairs Committee in Washingtonwhich is not qualified to judge on operational matters. The views of the colonial secretary are set out in the annexed note. We agree with him that now that weare proposing to set up a fully Combined Civil Affairs Committee in London weshould take the opportunity of pressing that this Committee should consider-all Civil Affairs matters arising in British territories in the Far East, Wewould particularly emphasise the point made at the end of the annexed noteby the Colonial Secretary namely, that unless Civil Affairs questions for british territories are decided in London there is a danger that a large element of theCivil. Affairs Staff for Borneo and Hong Kong will be the products of the UnitedStates Army and Navy Civil Affairs schools. This would increase our alreadydelicate problem of re-establishing British administration in those two territories.13. We therefore consider that on merits the right course would be for theproposed changes in the Combined Civil Affairs machinery to provide for theLondon Committee to deal with questions affecting British territories in theFar East. But we realise that there may be great difficulties in securing Americanconsent to this as the Pacific is primarily an American sphere of strategicresponsibility. It would be unfortunate if our proposals for Europe were rejected by the Americans by reason of our asking too much in respect of theFar East.Possible United States Reactions to our Proposals.14. Our proposals involve the transfer to London of many of the responsi-biliti.es of the present Combined Civil Affairs Committee in Washington. that committee would, however, still have a useful liaison function to perform ininterpreting and explaining as required to the Combined Chiefs of Staff therecommendations and decisions of the London Committee. In conjunction withthe appropriate Combined Boards it would also have responsibilities in the field of supply.15. We have been advised by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington and Field-Marshal Dill that the United States authorities are likely to opposeany suggestion that responsibility for Civil Affairs should be removed from the combined Chiefs of Staff or its agency, the Combined Civil Affairs Committeein Washington.16. We consider, however, that the advantages outlined above for bringing together in London the consideration of all Civil Affairs in Europe and in british territories in the Far East are so overwhelming that we should attempt to secureAmerican agreement, although this may not be easy. We therefore request thatthe Prime Minister should take the earliest opportunity of raising this matter with the President.Summary.17.   To sum up, our proposals are :  (i) A London Combined Civil Affairs Committee should be set up to dea!with all Civil Affairs matters in Europe (other than supply) and toadvise the Combined Chiefs of Stall&apos; on such matters.(ii) This Committee should also deal with Civil Affairs matters in british territories in the Far East. This should be put forward to the americans, but not pressed if it would clearly prevent their acceptance of (i) above.(iii) This Committee should be responsible to the United Kingdom and united States Governments except when operational considerations are involved, when it would report to the Combined Chiefs of Staff.
(iv) Civil Affairs supply questions should continue to be focussed in the combined machinery in Washington as at present.(v) The Washington Combined Civil Affairs Committee would continue todeal with Civil Affairs supply problems in all theatres, in conjunctionwith the Combined Boards. It would also act in a liaison capacitywhere necessary between the London Combined Civil AffairsCommittee and the Combined Chiefs of Staff.(vi) Instructions to Theatre Commanders on Civil Affairs, whether arisingfrom deliberations of the London or Washington Committees, would continue to be issued by the Combined Chiefs of Staff.C. B, A.Privy Council Office,11th November, 1943.ANNEX.Note by the Colonial Secretary., IF a Combined Civil Affairs Committee is established in London as beingthe reasonable and convenient centre for Civil Affairs connected with civil affairs questions of Europe, it is no less convenient that the London Committeeshould deal also with the Civil Affairs of British territories to be liberatedin the Far East.It has been already approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff that the directive to the Force Commander concerned with operations in any of those territories shall include the policies to be followed in the handling of civil affairs&apos; as formulated by the British Government and that if paramountmilitary requirements as determined by the Force Commander necessitate a departure from those policies, he will take action and report through the Chiefsof Staff to the CCS.The official and business knowledge and interests in Malaya, Borneo and HongKong are, in the main, to be found in London, and such experienced personnel as are not interned in these territories are here or can be traced from here.As the formulation of Civil Affairs policies of these territories is a matter for the British Government, and consequently the planning for those policiesnaturally falls to be clone here, the function of a Combined Civil Affairs Com-mittee would appear to be little more than a channel through which the policieswill be represented to the Combined Chiefs of Staff for the necessary instructionsto be incorporated in the directive of the Force Commander concerned. If the combined Civil Affairs Committee desired to question any section of the policy,the matter could most conveniently and reasonably be settled in a CombinedCivil Affairs Committee in London, where the Colonial Office and its expertpersonnel and information is ready to hand.Apart from the actual formulation of policies, however, the important thingfor us is to ensure that the Civil Affairs personnel carrying out those policies in the British territories concerned are British officers selected for their capacity to carry on and rebuild the Civil Administration after the military period is over.In our territories to be liberated in the sphere of the S.E. Asia Command(Malaya and Burma) we need have no apprehensions on that score, but in borneo and Hong Kong, which are in United States strategic spheres with United StatesForce Commanders, we may have more difficulty, and, if the planning of civil affairs for those British territories is placed under the charge of a CombinedCivil Affairs Committee in Washington rather than the similar Committee inLondon, the difficulty may well become a very real one; and we may find that to suit the Washington arrangements a large element at least of the Civil Affairsstaff for our territories in Borneo and Hong Kong will be the products of theUnited States Army and Naval Civil Affairs Schools, which would greatly increase our already delicate problem of re-establishing British administration in those two territories.(Signed) 0.
