The intake and net increases approved for the Forces and for Industryrespectively were given in W.P. (43) 454, paragraphs 3 and 5. Since the alloca-tions for the Forces were approved, certain adjustments have been agreed betweenthe Service Departments and decisions have been given as to certain classes whichshould not count against the allocations. While it has not been possible to take account of all these changes and adjustments in the intake figures given belowfor particular months, the necessary corrections have been made in arriving atthe balances of the allocations for the period 1st October to the 31st December,1943.Copy No. 3v7Intake into the Forces.3.

Changes in Industry.Supply Departments Munitions Industries.4. August and September. The following Table gives revised figures of the changes in August, including the effect of transfers of capacity within individual firms from the work of one Department to that of another.

It ispossible that a small part of the changes in this respect attributed to August may have occurred in June and July.5. It is safe to assume that the transfer of capacity within individual firmsfrom Ministry of Supply work to work for the Admiralty and Ministry of aircraft Production continued during September and resulted in substantial increases in the numbers employed on work for those two Departments over and above those shown in the foregoing Table. It is probable, therefore, that by theend of September the whole of the M.A.P. allocation of 115,000 for the period the 1st April to the 31st December had been met.Other Essential Industries and Services.6. Figures for these industries and services are not available for later datesthan those given in the report for August (W.P. (43) 454).Civil Defence.7. The War Cabinet directed that the numbers of full-time workers in civil defence (including Police and National Fire Service) should be reduced by afurther 15,000 before the end of 1943, in addition to the reduction of 75,000 fromthe 30th June, 1942, previously approved. This gives a total reduction of 90,000to be effected between the 30th June, 1942, and the 31st December, 1943. For themonth of August there was a reduction of 4,800, making the decrease up to the31st August, 1943, 69,500, and leaving a balance of 20,500.E.
