DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S G-0VERNME2fT) &amp; 9SJS..O RET COPY NO.W^g,(45) 5129TH NOVEMBER ,  1945WAR CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS AND UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCENote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer;.Xt -     My colleagues should be aware of the financial implications of the proposals of the assistance Board.2,        Immediately before supplementary pensions were firstintroduced in 1940 the cost of the rates of outdoor relief toold &apos;age pensioners was just over  5 million a year.     4*3$- -millionhas been voiced fo? supplementary pensions in t-h^ cisj?j?.ant^inaa^iial year.The immediate financial ofTeot of the proposals of theAssistance Board would be to add a further  of million a yearto the cost of the supplementary pensions of those old age andijo^i^ilmtory pensioners whose pensions are nov/ being supplemented*From a financial point of view, far the most important group of changes in supplementary pensions is the propo-s-sd increase in3he scale rates for the pensioners themselves,  and Ijtie abolitionof winter allowances and of the low rent rule.      The net costthis group of changes Is about  5-1- million.      Of the 14- jnillion,  750,000 represents the cost of levelling *b^,efor woiU0*i np to those for men.4$        The prospective financial implications are far moreimportant .(l) The above figures make no allowance for &quot;attraction&quot;,iee* for the cost of supplementary pensions to those who apply for the first time as a result of these changes.      The differencebetween the cost of outdoor relief to old age pensioners before1940 and the present cost of supplementary pensions is mainly due to this factor-     There are about 3 million old age andcontributory pensioners55 of whom rather over 1.4 million are receiving supplementary pensions.    Most of those not receivingsupplementary pensions are probably earning.      This v/ill not continue to the same extent after the war, and the easier theconditions for supplementary pensions become,  the greater willbe the inducement to give up earning,(2) The burden of old age is rising progressively.      In 1941there were 7-g- persons of 15 to 66 for every one over that age.By 1971 this figure will have fallen below 4;    i.e0 the burdenof the old &apos;on the workers will approximately double itself inthe next 30 years.This figure of 3^000,000 excludes widowsunder 60 without children.

(3) The above figures take no account of unemployment assistance^  the present cost of which is inconsiderable.      Butthe cost of the proposals for any given number of applicants.is considerably greater in unemployment assistance than it isin supplementary pensions0   &apos; The reason for this is the costof the Improvements in childrens&apos;  allowances, which have little effect in the supplementary pension field,      If therewere now 500,000 applicants for unemployment assistance,  thecost of the changes proposed would be - 6 million,,      ri?hisfigure would not be affected by the introduction of a schemeof family allowances at 5/- a week per child, because it isonly exceptionally that the present scale rate for a child is lower than 5/-.50        Finally, my colleagues will note that the  argument infavour of the new regulations rests in part on the substantial measure of simplification which is achieved;,      So far as theGovernment rely on the argument of simplification to justify,e9go  absorbing winter allowances in the rate of assistance,their defence against subsequent pressure to add to the new.rates a special supplement in respect of winter conditions would have to rest on the complexity which that introductionwould introduce,      I cannot regard this as a satisfactoryposition^      I understand,  however^ that it is the general viewof the members of the Lord President&apos;s Committee that if theBoard&apos;s proposals v/ere accepted by the Government and putforward to Parliament as representing the Governments viewof what would be a reasonable and lasting settlement of thequestion, there would be a good prospect that the proposals would be accepted as such.      In agreeing to the measure ofsimplification and to the consequent levelling up which is involved I should make it clear that I am relying on thisview being sound.Treasury Chambers.,S . v&apos;/ a 1 49th November,  1943
