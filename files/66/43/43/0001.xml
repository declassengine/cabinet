HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 543.2$th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON DEMOBILISATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Works.1. In paragraph 31 of the Report of the Demobilisation Committee(WP (43) 494) a reference is made to the effect of the demobilisation schemetherein, proposed on the labour available for the building industry, and it is statedthat the reductions must primarily fall on new housing. The purpose of this paper is to amplify this reference.2. Definite information is not yet obtainable about the probable speed of-demobilisation, but assuming that 500,000 were released in the first 9 months,and 500,000 in each subsequent period of 6 months, a rate which may very wellnot be achieved, the consequent numbers from the Forces, including the Navy andR.A.F., compared with what had been assumed when my paper P.R. (43) 44 was prepared, is as follows : -Estimate of Building Craftsmen to be Demobilised from the Forces.First      Second     Third      FourthEstimate. 6 months. 6 months. 6 months. 6 months.Original estimate, P.R. (43) 44 30,000 40.000 45,000 45,000New proposals ......        4,000      28,000      27,000      51,0003. I estimated in my paper P.R. (43) 44 that about 200,000 houses might becompleted in the first 2 years provided steps were taken to ensure that the labour employed on arrears of maintenance, the repair of war damage and new construe -tion other than housing was kept to the irreducible minimum. Thus an allocation of only 225,000 men was allowed at the end of the first year for bothmaintenance and war damage, compared with 200,000 at the present time, andwith over 300,000 employed on maintenance alone before the war.4. - Similarly, it was estimated that only 23.000 of the craftsmen available at the end of the first six months would be allocated to new construction forpriority industrial and other essential services. On the assumption that thiswould still be the minimum required, then the effect of the recent demobilisationproposals will be reflected entirely by a reduction in the amount of labour whichwill be available for building houses.5. When P.R. (43) 44 was discussed at the meeting of the ReconstructionPriorities Committee on the 30th July last it was recorded that it should bepossible to complete 30,000 houses in the second half of the first year after thewar and 170,000 in the second year a number already so small as to point to thedesirability of reviewing the assumptions, particularly with regard to demobili-sation, on which it was based. This estimate must now be reduced to 13,000houses in the first year and 100,000 in the second year, or by very nearly a halfin the first two years. On the other hand, for every additional 10,000 men that could be demobilised during the second six months of the first year, a further14,000 houses could be completed during those two years.6. The position under the Demobilisation Committee Report may well beless favourable than is indicated above, since these estimates are based on ratesof demobilisation assumed by the Committee,which it must be recognised may notbe achieved. -Ministry of Works,2Qth November, 1943.P.[26502]
