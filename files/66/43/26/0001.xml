- . 113THIS D0CU1ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT.Printed for the War Cabinet,     November 1943SECRET copy no.;7f.W.P. (43) 526.21st November, 1943WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS GREECE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Since the Cabinet considered, on November 16th, paperWP (43) 518 on policy towards Greece, further telegrams havebeen received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the GreekGovernment (Nos.362 of November 17th and 364 of November 18th)which show that the situation is deteriorating and that further delay in reaching a decision on the main issues ofpolicy would be dangerous.     I therefore suggest that authority should be given to the Commander-in-Chief Middle East andMr.Leeper to work out in conjunction the action to be takenin the military sphere on the lines suggested in Mr.Leeper&apos;telegram No.364.The question of the declaration which it is proposedthat the King of Greece should make is intimately linked with the action to be taken in Greece itself.     Further it is evident from Mr.Leeper&apos;s telegram No.362 that failing an early decision the Greek Government may disintegrate.     I would therefore suggest that this issue cannot be delayed untilthe King can come to London and that the matter should bebroached with him in Cairo.     The first approach might bemade by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, but I should hope to beable to follow it up myself, if Prime Minister agreed.A.E. -FOREIGN OFFICE,21st November, 1943.
