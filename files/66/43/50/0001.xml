(43) 550.2nd December, 1943.WAR CABINET.LEAKAGE OF INFORMATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.THE War Cabinet will wish to have an account of my enquiries into theleakage of information which I reported on the 12th November (W.M. (43) 153,Minute 3).2. The General Manager of the Press Association has been interviewed.He was not willing to break the journalistic code of protecting his sources, buthe gave an assurance that the information on which the Press Association actedon the afternoon of the 12th November had not come from anyone in london or from anyone consciously revealing a secret. He stated that it had come by telegram to London from a correspondent many miles away in the country, whosent a message to the following effect : &quot; Look out for another journey. No. 10may be able to tell you something.&apos;&apos; There seems to be little doubt that this message came from someone not in the newspaper world but in regular touchwith the Press Association, possibly from a port or railway official who knewsomething of what was going on.3. I am advised that legal action is not likely to be fruitful, as ultimately itwould be difficult to establish that the correspondent had communicated a reallydangerous piece of information to the Press Association in view of the fact thatno hint either of the destination or of the timing of the journey was given.4. There was no attempt on the part of the Press Association to break the censorship rules on this subject, which are well-known and which were strictly observed.B. B.2nd December, 1943.[26518-]
