naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Prior to the fail of Leros, Allied destroyers and light craft transportedreinforcements and carried out bombardments and nightly patrols. In the courseof frequent air attacks, one of II.M. destroyers was sunk.U.S. aircraft have caused further severe casualties to Japanese warships in the South-West Pacific.Shipping losses, due- chiefly to air attack on a convoy in the Mediterranean,have been heavier than of late.Home Waters.2. Four M.T.Bs., on the night of the 9th/ 10th, made contact with enemytrawlers off Ijmuiden in low visibility. While manoeuvring for position, two ofthe M.T.Bs. were sunk in collision.A convoy of landing craft, on passage from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom,was dispersed by a gale on the 13th in tile South-Western Approaches. Fourtank-landing craft were sunk.Slight damage to the Dockyard was caused during an air-raid at Plymouthearly on the 18th; but there were no naval casualties.Mediterranean.3. H.M. destroyers carried out a bombardment in the Gulf of Gaeta insupport of the Fifth Army on the night of the 8th/9th.Photographic reconnaissance at Gaeta on the 11th showed the northern endof the breakwater demolished and no active shipping present. At Leghorn two ships have been scuttled since the 6th and the northern entrance is blocked.Allied coastal craft intercepted an escorted tanker north of Civita Vecchiaon the night of the 11th/12th and damaged one of the escorts.HALS. (Mail (destroyer) was mined and severely damaged off Bari on the15th ; there were nine killed, six missing and five wounded.Levant.4. On the night of the 10th/11th, two of H.M. destroyers and the PolishKrakoiviafc carried out a bombardment of Port Kalymnos. No landing craft orcaiques were seen, but a cargo ship inside the breakwarter was set on fire. three destroyers, including the Greek Pliidos, bombarded Kos harbour. On thefollowing night, a minesweeper was bombed and damaged at.Leros. On the 12th,an attack was launched on Leros by troops carried m about 25 landing craftwhich were covered by four destroyers. Three of the landing craft were sunk.During the night, Allied destroyers and M.T.Bs. patrolled oil&apos; Leros and Kalymnoswithout incident. On the 13th, H.M.S. Dulverton (destroyer) was sunk by aglider-bomb off Kos; six officers and 103 ratings were rescued. Three destroyersshelled positions on Leros in support of British counter-attacks, and patrolledduring the night without incident. Heavy weather prevented Allied small craftfrom Samos reaching Leros with reinforcements. On the night of the 14th/15th,under frequent air attack, HALS. Echo (destroyer) carried. 187 troops from Samosto Leros. While withdrawing, she sank a landing craft laden with troops andguns off Aiinda Bay. Three of H.M. destroyers shelled small craft and enemy positions at Aiinda Bay and later were repeatedly bombed while patrolling.M.T.Bs., east of Kalymnos, sank two landing craft laden with troops. On the night of the 15th/16th. H.M. small craft carried two companies of troops to Leros.H.M. destroyer Penn was damaged by coastal batteries while operating off Lerosin company with another destroyer; they evacuated 80 wounded who had beenembarked from Leros in small craft.On the night of the 16th/17th, three of H.M. destroyers bombarded Kos.East Indies.5. H.M. S/M Tally-Ho sank a medium-sized cargo-ship while on patroloff Periang.
Pacific.6. U.S. submarines in Pacific and Far Eastern waters have recently sunkan aircraft transport, a medium-sized transport and five cargo ships. Two cargo ships have been damaged.New Britain.7. Details of casualties inflicted by U.S. carrier-borne and land-based aircraft on Japanese warships at Rabaul on the 11th are reported under &quot; air situation.&quot;Photographic reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 15th showed three destroyers,five U-boats and 19 ships of approximately 84,000 tons.Allied patrol craft on the night of the 9th /10th, sank four laden barges north of Finschhafen.Solomons.8. A force of US. cruisers and destroyers was attacked.by Japanese aircraft on.the night of the 12th/13th off Bougainville Island.   One ship was damaged.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. Operations during the week have been curtailed by weather. Nineattacks on U-boats have been reported. Of these, five were carried out by shore-based aircraft, one by carrier-borne aircraft and three by ships. One attack was made in the Mediterranean, and one in the northern Indian Ocean. U-boats were possibly damaged by an aircraft north-east of the Azores and by a Canadianaircraft south of Newfoundland on the 11th, and in mid-Atlantic by an aircraft from H.M.S. Biter (escort-carrier) on the 16th.Enemy Intelligence.10. The Tirpitz, Scharnhorst and five destroyers were seen in the Altenfiordarea by Russian reconnaissance on the 15th.The Graf Zeppelin is reported to have been seen on the 1st at Stettin, outof commission, and with no activity on board.11. It is estimated that six destroyers, six Elbing-class destroyers, fivetorpedo-boats and approximately 45 E-boats, 65 R-boats, 70 minesweepers and28 landing-craft are at present in the Channel and Biscay ports. The six destroyers are at Bordeaux and the six Elbing-cl&amp;ss destroyers with four torpedo-boats at Brest.U-boats.12. There are indications that the majority of U-boats at sea has movedeastwards from Canadian waters. In the Indian Ocean there is no evidencethat German U-boats are operating, but there may be two Japanese U-boats icthe northern part of the area.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. During the week one attack by a U-boat has been reported; a U.S. ship was sunk south of the Fiji Islands.An east-bound convoy was attacked by aircraft with glider-bombs andtorpedoes off Oran. Four ships, including a French naval tanker, were sunk andtwo others were damaged but reached port. (Details of this attack are given under paragraph 43.)A ship in coastal convoy was sunk by mine off Harwich.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the Aveek ending the 13th, 645 ships-Avere convoyed. Of these,93 ships were in ocean convoys and 552 in British coastal convoys. One escortcarrier, one A/A ship, 55 destroyers and 91 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes(including six U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.Two ocean convoys, consisting of 26 ships, arrived in Home Waters without loss.[26443] b
Allied Minelaying.15. &apos; Mines were laid by aircraft off the Biscay ports and the Frisian Islands.U.S. aircraft laid mines off Rangoon.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.18. - Minelaying by enemy aircraft is suspected off the South-West Coast on one night of the week.Eleven mines have been destroyed, eight of which were off the East Coast, andone ground mine off Swansea. The destruction of two ground mines off Plymouthled to the port being closed for a few hours.The mine totals are : 4,570 ground and 3,627 moored.17. Between the 1st and the 8th, a minesweeping flotilla destroyed 61 moored mines in the approach channel to Maddalena, north of Sardinia.The minefield in the Gulf of Gaeta is being cleared to assist bombardingforces; 28 mines were destroyed on the 12th.Enemy Merchant Shipping.18. Although reports are not complete, it is estimated that, in the attack by aircraft from the U.S.S. Ranger on enemy shipping in Bodo area on the4th October, about ten ships totalling some 43,000 tons may have been sunk, or seriously damaged. Four of these ships are believed to have been trooptransports.The German s.s. Tannenfels (7,840 tons) was seen to have arrived at Breston the 16th from the Gironde.Movements of eight of the ships engaged in the ore trade between Bilbaoand Bayonne have been reported during the week. They include the Baldur(5,000 tons), the Hochheimer (4,000 tons) and the Spanish Kauldi (3,153 tons).Three German ships totalling approximately 8.400 tons, entered theDardanelles on the 10th from the Piraeus for Istanbul.Danish Merchant Shipping.19. Two Danish ships, the Skaane (1,254 tons) and the Egholm (1.317 tons),which had been at Lisbon since 1940 arrived with an escort on the 12th at gibraltar. . .MILITARY SITUATION,The Russo-German Campaign.Nevel- Sector.20. There has been brisk local activity in the Nevel area but no change inthe position.Vitebsk Sector]21. The Germans reported strong Russian attacks on the 14th and 15thwest of Smolensk, but there is no confirmation of these from the Russians.Gomel Sector.22. The Russians have been attacking north of Gomel, where they reportthat they hold a bridgehead over the River Sozh. They have also attacked,north-westwards from the Loev area and have cut the road and railway to thewest of Rechitsa.Kiev Sector.23. The Russians have continued to extend their Kiev bridgehead, mainly to the north-west and west. Malin and Zhitomir were captured on the 13th andthe Russians have now advanced to within eight miles south of Koresten. the bridgehead, is now some 80 miles wide and 75 miles deep. The Germans have beencounter-attacking against the southern flank of the bridgehead and the Russiansadmit that they have abandoned a number of localities in the Zhitomir area.
Dnieper Bend.24. The Germans have reported Russian attacks since the 13th in theCherkasi-Kremenchug sector and on the 15th they admitted the existence ofRussian bridgeheads north-west of Cherkasi and Kremenchug. german resistance and counter-attacks in the Krivoi Rog area have not succeeded in forcing the Russians to give ground, but have prevented them from making anyfurther progress.Lower Dnieper Sector.25. The Germans still hold a bridgehead across the Dnieper south ofNikopol.Crimea.28. Russian attacks against the Perekop Isthmus have met strong german resistance and have made little progress. North-east of Kerch, where fiercefighting has been taking place, the Russians have consolidated and slightlyextended their bridgehead and have reached the outskirts of Kerch. In the bridgehead south of Kerch the Russians have held the Germans, but have gainedno more ground.General.27. The Russians have again had a very successful week. They haveconsiderably enlarged their Kiev bridgehead and have resumed their advancefurther north in the Loev sector.Italy.General.28. Heavy rain has impeded, the advance of the Fifteenth Army Groupduring the past week. In the mountains snow has fallen. Conditions have been particularly bad on the Eighth Army front, where diversions round brokenbridges have been washed away, and at times it has been impossible even to deployartillery off the roads to support our attacks. On the Fifth Army front brigadesin some instances are able to.maintain forward communications only by jeeps andcarriers, and forward of battalion headquarters supplies have to be carried on foot by labour companies.Eighth Army.29. Activity on the front has been confined to patrolling and local attacks against light opposition. In the coastal sector the 78th Division has sent strongpatrols across the River Sangro to cover reconnaissance of suitable crossing places,and Indian troops have made slight advances north of Atessa. Further inlandthe Canadians have occupied Vastogirardi and British troops are establishednorth-west of Rionero.Fifth A rmy. . .      .30. In this sector fighting has been severe. The Germans have transferreda division from the front of the Eighth Army to that of the Fifth Army and haveexerted considerable effort to stem the advance of the latter, particularly in thecentre, which is held by U.S. and British troops. They have put in repeatedcounter-attacks supported by heavy artillery concentrations in the region ofMount Maggiore, and have caused local Allied withdrawals. Further west therehas been much patrolling across the River Garigliano by British troops andMinturno is reported to be strongly held by the enemy./aegean Operations.     (An outline map is included as an inset.)Leros.31.   The island of Leros has been lost after a stern five-day battle.   TheGermans launched their attack at 0630 hours on the 12th.   They establishedbridgeheads on the eastern coasts of the northern and central sectors of the[28443] . b 2
island. At 1430 hours they landed parachute troops on the isthmus between thesetwo sectors and gained control of Rachi Ridge. Further parachute troops were landed during the night of the 12th/13th.On the 13th the Germans enlarged their two bridgeheads and established themselves more firmly on. the isthmus. However, during the night of the13th/14th the 4th Buffs in the northern sector counter-attacked, drove the enemyeastwards towards the sea, and started to advance south towards Quaranta. The1st Kings Own made an unsuccessful counter-attack on the enemy bridgeheadin the central sector, but the enemy here was being held.On the 14th an enemy attack towards Meraviglfa, the location of FortressHQ. in the central sector, was beaten off and followed up by a counter-attacknorthwards towards Quaranfca by the 1st King&apos;s Own and the 2nd Royal IrishFusiliers. The enemy on the isthmus was driven into a small area on Rachi Ridgeby this pincer attack. On the 15th an attack was launched to clear the enemyoff this.part of Rachi Ridge, but it failed largely owing to heavy and continuousdive-bombing.During the night of the 15th/16th enemy reinforcements were landed on theLeros peninsula. At 0815 hours on the 16th Fortress HQ. was heavily dive-bombed and the situation became critical during the morning. No wirelessmessages were received after 2000 hours, and it w^as concluded that the islandhad been lost by then.   The garrison is reported to have fought magnificently.The enemy dive-bombing was kept up continuously on a very heavy scaleindeed (vide Air Situation, paragraph 46).Greece,32. There has been little change in the situation. E.D.E.S. are still being attacked in their positions in South Epirus by both E.L.A.S. and the Germans.The E.L.A.S. attacks, however, have been the responsibility of Ares, one of theircommanders, whom it is believed E.L.A.S. Headquarters are unable to control.E..L.A.S. have been engaged against the Germans in other parts of Greece,particularly in Western Macedonia and in the Peloponnesus, where they have carried out sabotage operations against the railways.Yugoslavia.33. Fighting in Slovenia has continued, mainly in the mountains south ofLjubljana and near Aidussina on the Italian side of the frontier. German forces have succeeded, after three weeks of stubborn fighting, in driving the Partisansfrom the Peljesac peninsula. The Germans have also occupied the small islandsoff the entrance to Split harbour, thus securing their sea supply route betweenSibenik and Split.In the Northern Adriatic the Germans have successfully attacked and occupied the important islands of Krk (Vegiia), Lussin and Cherso which hadbeen held by the Partisans. In Bosnia a German offensive against Tuzla is beingstubbornly resisted; Srebrenica has been occupied by the Partisans.Clashes betwTeen the Partisans and Bulgarian troops have occurred in Serbia,and there are some indications that Mihailovitch units are assisting the bulgarians in this area.34. In the Arakan, patrol activity has continued. On the 10th our forcesevacuated Daletme as a result of Japanese infiltration up the Kaladan River.On the 12th the Japanese, estimated at about 250, withdrew again from Daletmeand are now about three miles to the south-west.In the Chin Hills the Japanese have made further&apos; small advances, occupyingHaka on the 11th and forcing us to evacuate Fort White on the 14th. It is claimed that heavy casualties wrere inflicted on the enemy.In Northern Burma, the Japanese are reported to be reinforcing Sumprabuniand the Hukawng Valley areas.   -New Guinea,35. In both the Finschhafen and Ramu Valley areas there has been patrolactivity only. The Japanese are reported to be strengthening their defences nearYaula, twenty miles north-west of Dumpu, on the road from the Ramu. Valleyto the coast.
Solomons.36. Mopping-up has continued on Treasury Island (Mono) where there are estimated to be now only 20 Japanese surviving.In Bougainville, on the night of the 7th/8th, the enemy made a landing from20 barges in the area of Cape Torokina, at the northern end of Empress AugustaBay. The U.S. forces counter-attacked, inflicting about 400 casualties, after which the enemy withdrew northward. The U.S. forces are following them up,and are now patrolling about five miles north of Cape Torokina. The japanese are estimated to have about 6,000 troops available as reinforcements in this area from South Bougainville.Further large landings of U.S. personnel and stores have been made atEmpress Augusta Bay.AIR SITUATION.General Review.37. U.S. heavy and medium bombers made daylight attacks on targets inFrance, Germany and Norway. At night, aircraft of Bomber Command attackedMannheim/Ludwigshafen and the railway yards at Cannes.Medium bombers attacked the railway centre at Sofia.Heavy enemy air attacks were made on Leros.Enemy shipping at Rabaul and airfields on Bougainville were heavily bombed.United Kingdom.38. During daylight, no enemy aircraft were overland. On the night 15th/16th, 20 enemy aircraft operated overland, the majority of these concentratingover the Plymouth area; during the remaining nights no enemy aircraft crossedour coasts.Home Waters.39. Typhoons, two of which are missing, made several attacks on shippingoff Brittany and Holland; a coaster and a tug were sunk, and eight coastersand nine other small ships were damaged. Hurricanes sank a trawler offBoulogne.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 45 were despatched, laid 109 sea-mines in enemy waters.   Two aircraft are missing.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.40. Heavy bombers of the U.S. VIIIth  Bomber Command and medium bombers of the IXth U.S. Air Force attacked the following targets : Date.nth18th16thTarget.&apos; Attacked    ,j, I aircraft Despatched.

Military objectives on the Cherbourg peninsula were also attacked byTyphoon bombers, which dropped 14 tons of bombs with unobserved results.Similar targets near Cap Gris Nez were attacked by Mitchells (B. 25), Bostons(A. 20) and Typhoon bombers, which dropped 120 tons with good results.Twelve Typhoon bombers attacked the airfield and seaplane base at Brest/Lanveoc, on which several hits were obtained and a Mosquito scored hits on asynthetic oil plant near St. Nazaire.Railway and other targets in Northern France and the Low Countries were attacked by Mustangs (P. 51), Typhoons and Spitfires; three locomotives were destroyed and 48 locomotives and several barges and other small craft were damaged.During all these operations, Allied fighters (which flew 1,915 sorties duringthe week) and bombers destroyed 71 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 26 and damaged 22 for the loss of 12 Liberators (B. 24), nine Fortresses (B. 17) and26 fighter-bombers and fighters.Night.41. On the 7th/18th.&apos;83 aircraft of Bomber Command were despatched to make a blind-bombing attack on Mannheim/Ludwigshafen; 74 attackeddropping 303 tons of bombs. It is estimated that a good concentration of bombingwas achieved.A total of 105 Mosquitoes, two of which are missing, made small-scale attacks on Berlin. Dusseklorf, Bochum, Krefeld, Essen, Bonn, Cologne, Gelsenkirchen,Duisburg and Hanover.Intruder aircraft flew 29 sorties over Northern France and Belgium. Creilairfield was bombed and 18 locomotives were damaged; two aircraft are missing.Leaflets were dropped on several French towns by a total of 18 Wellingtons.South of France.42. At night, Cannes railway centre was attacked by 128 heavy bombersbased in the United Kingdom: 272 tons of bombs were dropped. Weather overthe target was excellent and a s;ood concentration of bombs maintained. Grounddefences in the area were negligible and there are do reports of enemy fighteropposition.   Of the 134 aircraft despatched, five Flalifaxes are missing.Four Lancasters from the U.K. and four Wellingtons from North Africamade night attacks on the Antheor viaduct, and six Lancasters bombed a railway bridge at A gay (one mile S.S.W. of Antheor). Twenty Liberators (B. 24), basedon North Africa, made a daylight attack on this viaduct; the railway is believed to have been severed north of the target. Thirteen Liberators (B. 24) bombed aball-bearing works at Annecy.A railway bridge over the River Var, near Nice, was bombed at night by six Wellingtons. The airfield at Istres Le Tube (27 miles N.W. of Marseilles)and the adjacent airfield at Salon, were attacked by 83 Fortresses (B. 17) and43 escorted Marauders (B. 26) respectively. Of about 50 enemy fightersencountered, 13 were destroyed. Three Fortresses (B. 17) are missing. these aircraft are all based on North Africa.Italy.43. Allied fighters, light and fighter-bombers continued attacks on targets in the battle area and behind the enemy lines; over 800 sorties were flown onthese operations. Successful attacks were made on troops, gun positions, roads,railways, bridges and transport vehicles. In addition to these sorties, Spitfirescarried out patrols, and on three occasions encountered a total of 75 aircraft, ofwhich 14 were shot down for the loss of one Spitfire.At night, 42 Wellingtons bombed and hit a rail bridge at Pontassieve(nine miles E. of Florence). 23 others attacked the viaduct at Recco (15 miles.S.F. of Genoa), and the railway centre at Prato (10 miles N.W. of Florence)was bombed by a further 41 Wellingtons. Further night attacks were carriedout by Bostons (A. 20) on the harbour and shipping at Civitavecchia, and byMosquitoes on trains and transport between Rome and Spezia. During these latter operations two trains were destroyed and others damaged. On most nightsWellingtons dropped leaflets over Northern Italy. Marauders (B. 26) madesuccessful daylight attacks on the railways at Orbettello (90 miles N.W. of Rome)and Montalto di Castro (55 miles N.W. of Rome).
Forty-nine Fortresses (B. 17) bombed the railway centre and bridge atBolzano; Lightnings (P. 38) provided escort for part of the way. Much rolling-stock was destroyed, the lines to Innsbruck and Oallalbo were cut, and a railway bridge damaged. Eighteen other Fortresses (B. 17) attacked alternative targets in North Italy. About 20 to 30 enemy fighters, of which three were probably destroyed, were encountered.. Six Fortresses (B. 17) are missing. Twenty-twoLiberators (B. 24) escorted by 32 Lightnings (P. 38) bombed a ball-bearing works at Villa Perosa (22 miles W.S.W. of Turin); 6(5 tons of bombs were dropped.About 30 enemy aircraft carrying torpedoes and glider-bombs attacked a convoy off Oran, Algeria (vide Naval Situation, paragraph 13). Losses sustained by our ships were due to torpedoes; the glider-bombs failed to find their targets,partly as a result of the successful laying of smoke-screens.Over the battle area enemy fighter-bomber activity increased to an effort ofabout 40 sorties daily; several distinct attacks were made in various sectors,each escorted by Me. 109s.Yugoslavia and Albania.44. At Durazzo, 12 Mitchells (B. 25) bombed the docks and shipping, eightbarges were destroyed and a number of bursts seen amongst oil. cisterns. Spitfiresmachine-gunned M.T., a petrol dump and barracks, and bombed an oil storagedepot.Berat/Kucove (Albania) airfield and a nearby oil refinery were bombed by51 Mitchells (B. 25), numerous fires were started, and explosions at the refinerywere caused.Mitchells (B. 25) obtained four hits on a large ship in. the harbour at Split;further hits were made on small craft and the railway. Fifty-nine fighters and fighter-bombers carried out an armed reconnaissance of the Dalmatian Coast;attacks were made on trains, a camp, vehicles and a Siebel ferry. Fifty-seven aircraft of a similar type attacked the airfield at Mostar (50 miles N.N.W. ofDubrovnik).Bulgaria.45. Eighty-eight Mitchells (B. 25), escorted by 48 Lightnings (P. 38),attacked the railway centre at Sofia; 141 tons of bombs were dropped. Thewhole target was well covered and many fires and explosions were caused. hits were also made on a locomotive repair shop and buildings west of the target.Considerable railway activity was seen at the time of the attack. About 20Ale. 109 were encountered and six destroyed for the loss of one Lightning (P. 38).Dodecanese, Crete and Greece.46. In the ZFgean, Allied aircraft provided continuous cover for ourwarships.Beaufighters and Mitchells (B. 25) flew offensive sweeps over Leros and against enemy shipping in the vicinity. A Siebel ferry, escorted by 15 enemy aircraft, was attacked and later seen to explode, and an enemy destroyer was hit by 75 mm. shells. Several ships off the north coast of Crete were attacked, andhits with cannon shells were seen. Baltimores (A. 30) bombed shipping andshore installations at Suda Bay. During these operations 11 Beaufighters andone Mitchell (B. 25) were lost, and three enemy aircraft were destroyed.Hurricanes flew offensive sweeps over Crete, attacking troops, camps, radioinstallations and a building believed to be the German Headquarters; a totalof 44 Hurricanes, of which nine are missing, was employed on these operations.A number of other offensive sweeps was flown over Rhodes by Hurricanes and long-range Spitfires. ,&apos;Airfields on Rhodes, Kos and Crete were attacked by a total of about 140bombers, of which nearly half were heavies. The.greatest proportion of this effort was directed on Maritsa and Calato (Rhodes) and Antiinachia (Kos).Forty-six Liberators (B. 24) dropped 60 tons of fragmentation bombs on theEleusis (Athens) airfield, where a number of aircraft was seen to be destroyed.A second attack was made on this airfield by 79 Mitchells (B. 25) and a, further60 tons of bombs were dropped. Kalamaki (Athens) airfield was attacked by45 Mitchells (B.^25), 35 tons of fragmentation bombs being dropped.Twenty-seven Dakotas (0. 47) and seven Ilalifaxes dropped supplies to our troops on Leros. Other supplies were dropped to Patriot Forces on Crete and in greece.
Enemy aircraft provided escorts for their shipping along the route to Leros,about 30 Arado 196 and 20 Me. 109 being used for these operations. Bomberattacks on Leros, by the 11th, had risen to a daily total of about 60 sorties,Ju. 88 and Ju. 87 being principally employed. The number of sorties tended toincrease, and, on the 15th and night 15th/ 16th, a total of 440 sorties was made inbomb and machine-gun attacks. Enemy seaplanes brought supplies to the north-west part of the island, and two parachute landings were made (on the 12th and13th) from a fleet of about 40 Ju. 52.Enemy air reconnaissance extended as far east as Alexandria and west to theheel of Italy. The usual areas in the xEgean and-Dodecanese areas were coveredby clay and on some nights.Russia.47. The deterioration in weather at the end of last week has continued,and there is no doubt now that the weather is seriously affecting flying operations.The day-by-clay claims of German aircraft shot down by fighter and A.A. defencesare considerably less than last week; they amount to some 128 aircraft for theweek. The communiques give no indication of air activity over some parts ofthe front, and the German news service and radio make frequent mention of rain,snow and dense clouds.Nevertheless, in spite of adverse flying conditions the Russians have beenable to give close-support to their ground forces over the area of the break-through to Zhitomir, in the area south of Rechitsa, and over their landingbridgeheads near Kerch.From Gomel to the Far North there has been no mention of any activity; itit difficult to say how much this is due entirely to bad weather, but it is known that the weather in the Leningrad area is at present unsuitable for operations.The Germans have concentrated a strong close-support and bomber force insupport of their troops defending Krivoi Rog. This concentration of air power has contributed to stemming the Russian advance in this area. On the otherhand it has left the German forces at both extremities of the Dnieper frontwithout adequate air cover.In the supply of ground and air units in the Kerch area the Germans have animportant commitment. As at Stalingrad, air transport is likely to cause a weakening; of the German Air Force and a wasting of its resources.India and Burma.48. The principal targets were enemy railways and shipping. The railwayshops at Myitnge, near Mandalay, were demolished and railway yards at Prome,Yamethin and. Pegu were seriously damaged. A bridge at Kawlin, in CentralBurma, was destroyed and at least three other bridges were rendered unserviceable.At least four locomotives we re-destroyed, while several other locomotives and manyrailway trucks were damaged. Several steamers and numerous small river craft were successfully attacked.Among other targets attacked were airfields at Heho, Minzu (near Mandalay),Myitkyina, Mingaladon and Katha, oil installations at Nyaunghia (108 miles . of Rangoon), and a factory at Mogaung in. Upper Burma.Eighteen enemy aircraft bombed Kumbhirgram airfield in Assam, damagingsix aircraft oil the ground. Beaufighters destroyed an enemy flying-boat offCeylon and damaged another near Madras.China.49. The Burma Road, west of Lungling, was successfully bombed by sixLiberators (B. 24). Enemy targets in the Liehow area (310 miles E. ofChungking) were attacked by Kittyhawks (P. 40) which sank one river steamerand several small craft and inflicted casualties on troops. Fourteen Mitchells(B. 25) bombed Yochow (100 miles S.W. of Hankow), where several buildings andtwo gun positions were destroyed.Pacific Zone.New Britain.50. On the 11th, two groups of carrier-borne aircraft (comprising 143 light bombers and 125 fighters) and 42 Liberators (B. 24) attacked enemy warships inRabaui harbour.   A light cruiser and two destroyers were sunk and a heavy
