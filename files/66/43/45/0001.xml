My original estimate of the need of labour to achieve the full programme was on the basis of 212,000 prior to the 31stDecember, 1943c      Thereafter I anticipated further increases inaddition to the maintenance of the, existing force.3* It is now estimated In M.P.(43)3 that we shall havereceived 200,000 extra labour by the end of this year,I&quot; think that this is an optimistic forecast, but time will show whether it is realised.4* It must,  however, be borne in mind that the resultantlabour force Is already very low in skilled., and semi-skilled workers and that any fall in the percentage of skilled and semi-skilled workers will have an altogether disproportionate effect upon production.5. As I forecast earlier in the year when the labour intakewas slowed down the effect has been that we have been unable this autumn to reach our programme.6. The following figures show the degree of that failure,taking the programmed weight of aircraft for January,  1943 at 100:-1943JanuaryFebruaryMarchApril.MayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberDeliveries94*8101 .4111.3105.811 9.8110.6106.2105.41:21 ,0122.6Programme10099.8109.6108a911 8.4112.8110.2114.8T52T?137.17. This failure has been due to a number of factors of whichthe.most important are the following:-

(1) The lack of labour recruitment in the early partof tho year.(2) Slackening tempo in some factories due to fatigue andan increasing confidence in tho outcome of the war.(3) Strikes,- (h)  Increase of capacity to spares production.      Thooutput of spares, as a percentage of the output of complete aircraft, for a very largo sample of our aircraft firms has increased as follows(5) Technical difficulties encountered with now andmodified types.(6) A constant demand for modifications and new equipmentincluding work for the U.S.A.A.F.(7) Multiplication of &quot;marks&apos;1 of certain aircraft leading to breakdown in flow production.S, The planned programme as at present put forward envisagesin the fifth year of the war (October&apos; 19h-3-19kh)  a net increase of550 aircraft per month and of 54 million pounds structure weight,compared to an increase in the year October 19^2-191+3 of 127aircraft of 3*375,000 lbs structure weight.9* It is  quite clear,  therefore,  that if we are to stabilise the labour force as at December 31st,  19U3 we shall not be ableto achieve the programme despite all the increase in efficiencywe hope to get.10.  If we lose a substantial amount of labour,  andespecially if we lose skilled and semi-skilled labour,  therewill be a falling off of product! a or at the very best amaintenance of the level of December, 19h3o11o If this decline in labour force is allowed to takeplace by &quot;controlled wastage&quot; without any re-planning of theprogramme, there will be a very serious condition created inwhich the various items will get out of phase with resultantwaste and inefficiency,12*  If there is to be a. cut on the labour force,  or if itis desired to reach the original peak in curtain operational typesdespite the shortage of labour, it will be necessary to recast theprogramme and to omit or drastically reduce some items which are less important,13c  I could not accept the responsibility for the aircraft programme under any other conditions.      If therefore the cut is inevitable, as I appreciate it may be, it must be dene on an1 914.3 January13*17013*0;.o1 2 c 8%11t. 6;o1 6,7,.,1 7.2%1 6.1%1 7.6;o18,3%FebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberA

?rderly and planned basis;, on the following lines.(a) My Department must rev/rite the programme inconsultation with the Air Ministry and admiralty eliminating or severely reducingthose typos which are of less value in theirimpact on the enemy during 19kk and 1945*(b) Some new typos must not Toe put into productionhut should proceed on development contractsonly.(c) Within the numerical total of the labour force from time to time there must be the maximum of freedom of movement from one unit to anotherwithout danger of losing the labour,(d) For those factories which are regarded as vital(o.g. Lancaster ana Halifax) provisions shouldbe made to maintain wastage and where necessarytransfer labour   from other M.A.P. factorieswhose production is falling off.(e) The present proportion of skilled and semi-skilled labrxt must at least be maintained.2kth November,  1c43HoS.C.
