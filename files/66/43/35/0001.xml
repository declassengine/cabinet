THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.TSie cirewlatiora of this paper has been strictly limited. It Is issued for the personal use of ........MOST SECRET . Copy Ho.W.P. (43) 535.25th November, 1943.WAR  CABINET.CIVIL DEFENCE AND MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.WITH every desire to help to bring the maximum striking effort to bear in1944, I have considered very carefully the suggestion in the report of theOfficial Committee on Man-Power (M.P. (43) 3) that the whole-time strength ofthe Civil Defence Services should be reduced from 294,000 the strength at the31st December next as authorised in July last by 50,000 to 244,000 in the first half of next year. I have consulted the Minister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland, as both Ministers are&apos; responsible for some of the servicesgrouped by the Committee under the head of Civil Defence. They share not onlymy desire to make the maximum possible contribution, but my apprehensions thatwe may be running serious risks of inadequate Civil Defence cover in time of need if the Committee^ suggestions are adopted in their present form.2. I ought to point out that the Civil Defence Services, from the lateautumn of 1939, have been under constant review for the purpose of savingman-power. At one time the peak strength was about 400,000. Only in the caseof the National Fire Service (which Service had to be created on the basis of strengthening, as well as reorganising, the local authorities&apos; services and bringing them under central control) has there been any substantial increase inthe establishments laid down in the early stages of the war. By a series of cuts,the last of which was settled so recently as July last, the combined whole-timestrength of all services. Fire, Police and Civil Defence ^General), was to bebrought down by the end of this vear to 293,600, of which 119,200 were authorised for the N.F.S., 81,100 for the Police and 93,300 for the Civil Defence (General)Services. (The number of women included in these totals is approximately 29,000(N.F.S.), 5,000 (Police) and 31,000 (Civil Defence (General) Services).)3. The Police and Fire Services have duties for which provision must inany event be made, in war as in peace, irrespectively of any risk of air attack;and, even if the air raid risk could be wholly disregarded, it would be essentialto retain considerably stronger Fire Services than would be .required in peacetime in the main ports of entry and industrial centres.4. It must also be borne in mind that men and women retained in the civil defence Services are making a by no means negligible contribution to theindustrial effort of the country. Thus, in the N.F.S. a considerable number ofmen are regularly engaged in building work for N.F.S. purposes, for keeping inrepair the fleet of pumps and motor vehicles and other equipment, while in allthe Services men and women who can be spared temporarily from other dutiescontribute in various ways, e.g., by undertaking productive (including munitions)work at their stations or depots, on release for short periods to work in house-building, agriculture or other industry, or by performing non-Civil Defenceduties for &quot;the local authorities who are nominally their employers. further reductions in Civil Defence personnel would certainly cut into this contributionto the productive effort of the country, and leave certain of the essential work undone4.[26475]
5. As regards the main proposition that the Services should be cut by afurther 50,000 in the first half&apos; of 1944, I, and the other Ministers concerned,accepted the cuts of July last and reorganised the Services on the understandingthat, until we had received a new appreciation of the risks of air attack to justifyfurther reductions in strength, the Services would remain at the strength thenfixed for them at the end of this year. Moreover, when the last reductions were settled, no account was taken, of the possibility of new forms of attack. As Istated in W.P. (43) 520, if rocket attack were developed on any large scale,military reinforcements in considerable strength would be required to deal withthe resultant loss of life and damage to property. As, however, the soldiers would consist mainly of men who had not been trained in rescue and first-aid work, theywould want expert guidance in the intricacies of rescue and other CD. opera-tions. It would therefore be a very serious step to deplete further the civil defence Services of their trained personnel, for, although in some areas theServices may be found in greater strength than is now required for purely localemergencies, it is from these areas that reinforcement would have to be obtainedif rocket bombardment or exceptionally heavy raids were to take place in london or the South of England, or if raiding were to be resumed in areas which haverecently been regarded as relatively immune. There is the further point that, ifthe enemy knew that we had denuded these&apos; areas, in which it is proposed, in anycase, to weaken their anti-aircraft defences, of their Civil Defence resources, he might be tempted to make a special effort to attack them.8. We are now approaching a period at which certain parts of the country may be .subject to heavy attack in connection with the preparations for, orexecution of, overseas operations. It is clear that a considerable strength ofN.F.S. personnel will be required to provide, additional protection for portinstallations, transport and munitions in certain coastal areas, and possibly alsooverseas, with the result that, so far as I can estimate, the N.F.S. strengths in therest of the country will have to be depleted by over 50 per cent, by the end of June.These measures may well be vital to the success of the military operations; atany rate, the reinforcement of these special target areas is a precaution whichcannot be neglected. Similar considerations apply in a greater or less degree inthe case of the other Services, and if (as stated above) the anti-aircraft defencesin the less vulnerable areas are being depleted at the same time as substantialcuts from, the Civil Defence Services become effective, the result will be to denudeour resources in the less vulnerable areas of both passive and active defences atthe same time.7. In all the circumstances. I cannot for the time being assent to theproposed cuts, which I regard as dangerous to the well-being of the civil popula-tion. If. however, the Cabinet decide that the sacrifices are necessary, I shouldbe failing in my duty if I did not stipulate that, if any further reduction is tobe made in the strength of Civil Defence, it must rest with the Ministers concernedwith the administration of the Services to say which men and women within theprescribed total can be released, and from what areas they should be taken. Wemust protect ourselves against the loss of the key-personnel and of all the morerobust and younger element of the Services; if this proposition is not accepted,the Government as a whole must be prepared to accept responsibility for anybreakdowm in civil defence organisation.8. The Civil Defence (General) Services have been combed out for skilled and strong men and for young mobile women, on several, occasions, and, apartfrom the Rescue Service and, to a less extent, the Ambulance Service, they nowcontain very few people under late middle age. Those remaining in the service as a whole, apart from the younger men still retained, in the Rescue Services,have, I fear, little industrial value. There are already on offer to the Ministerof Labour and National Service as part of the cut decided in July last some 5,000men and women for whom he cannot easily find employment. In the police service it would, in my view, be unsafe to let any more regulars join the forces or go into industry the regular personnel are below peace-time strength and forsome time recruiting has stopped and only the younger auxiliaries can beregarded as satisfactory substitutes for the regulars. Accordingly, any cut fromthe Police Service must be at the expense of the auxiliaries and mainly the olderones. My view as regards the police is reinforced by that of the Regional Commis-sioners, some of whom have made strong representations to me that the existingstrength, of the police in their Regions is inadequate, and that it would be veryprejudicial to the interest of law and order if any further cuts in their strength
were made. The presence of large numbers of American soldiers in this countryand the special problems arising therefrom have added considerably to the burdensfalling on the police.9. The National Fire Service stands in a special position. It contains ahigh proportion of men under 40, and a number of young mobile women, manyof whom must be available for reinforcement duties away from their homes.Youth and good physique are required to fight fires, and I must be very careful not to lose too many of the younger and stronger men. If, as may well prove to be the case, the Army, at the outset of further overseas operations orsubsequently, finds itself under the necessity of strengthening its fire-fightingresources in this country or abroad, the i^young trained personnel of the N.F.S.are the most obvious source of reinforcement. If. in the interval, these youngelements have been dispersed to non-specialised formations of the fighting services or absorbed into industry, however important, they will be lost to fire fighting and cannot be recalled.   And that would seem to me to be most unwise.10. For a number of reasons, the chief of which is that the Civil defence services must be able to put forward the maximum effort of which they are stillcapable when the time of severest trial in&apos; store for them arrives, I should find itless difficult to make reductions if they could be postponed until the second half ofthe year, particularly as regards the National Fire Service.11. To conclude : if in all the circumstances the Cabinet insist on theproposed cut, I would ask (a) That, apart from normal wastage, the reductions should be deferred tothe second half of the year.(b) That the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself make the selection within the prescribed total, though we will,of course, consult the Minister of Labour and National Service with aview to affording him the maximum, assistance possible.(c) No regular  Police should be released  and not too many youngerauxiliaries.(d) That the normal wastage from ail the Services occurring throughout thewhole year, amounting to, perhaps, 28,000 per annum, should be takenfully into account, even if the releases can be accomplished before theend of the year.(e) To the extent necessary to provide substitutes for some of the whole-timepersonnel released, the Minister of Labour and National Service shouldcontinue to direct men and women into the part-time Civil defence services as required, and that, in particular, now that the supply ofsuitable men and women for part-time duties is approaching;exhaustion in many areas, younger men from, the Flome Guard shouldbe directed into the part-time Civil Defence Service as necessary.12.
