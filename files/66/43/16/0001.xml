THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 516.12th November, 1943.WAR CABINET.AIR RAID CENSORSHIP.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and the Minister of Information.ARISING out of the detailed newspaper reports of the dance-hall incidentin last Sunday night&apos;s air raid, we were invited, at a Meeting of the WarCabinet on the 8th November last (WM. (43) 151st Conclusions, Minute 2), toconsider an amendment of the procedure of reporting air raid incidents on thefollowing lines :  (a) That the rule about publication of casualties should be strictly adhered to, i.e., that there should be no publication of casualties in particularraids except by special Cabinet direction.(&amp;) That the newspapers should be prevented from publishing detailedaccounts of particular incidents without special authority.2. About the first point there need be no difficulty. One press report of lastSunday&apos;s incident, without being a technical breach of the existing security rule,did convey an impression of heavy loss of life by its comparison with an earlierincident for which the death roll had been published. This passage was notsubmitted to censorship. The offending newspaper has agreed that it should havebeen submitted and was an evasion of the rule, and has apologised for it. Therewill be no difficulty about issuing a reminder to the press of the importance ofthe casualty rule and of its observation in the spirit as well as in the letter.3. The second proposal presents more difficulties. The basis of the censorship is a Defence Regulation forbidding publication of information of value to the enemy. This has always been construed as covering only information of technical value to the enemy in his military operations, not the value to the enemy of reports depressing to our morale or encouraging to his. The newspapers havebeen quick to detect and resist any restriction in this latter sense, though theywill often accept advice and guidance from the Government about questions ofmorale, explicitly put forward as such.4. The only way in which the censorship could be operated to prevent such reports of particular incidents as those now in question would be to make a new defence Regulation. The press would resist it strongly and publicly. They wouldhave on their side the point that the whole of the blitz was weathered without aprovision which it was now proposed to introduce in the latter phase of the war.They might also argue that there have been times when the Government has feltthat the national interest was served by emphasising rather than minimising theextent and severity of particular raids or their effects.5. In our view a more normal procedure would be to send a letter of guidance to editors asking them, for given reasons, to place little emphasis on the effects of small-scale raids and of particular incidents resulting from them. It could be pointed out that accounts of a big incident which might be the only result of aparticular raid would be of greater value to the enemy than a similar account ofan incident which was one of many in a big raid.[26408]
6. It should, however, be realised that such a request, however well argued,might at the present juncture strike the press as inconsistent with earlier requeststo place full emphasis on such reports for the sake of reminding the public thatthe risk of air attack was still real. Nor does it appear to accord with theattitude of the Government to the recent statement by Sir Walter Citrine.The press might be expected to ask whether it was not in fact in the national interest to keep the public reminded that the war is still very much on our door-step and that the need for readiness is still urgent. It is notable that severaldifferent papers in their editorial comment on Sir Walter Citrine&apos;s recent speechused the severity of last Sunday night&apos;s incident as the best and most practicalrefutation of his thesis.7.   There is another point.   Fairly full accounts of Sunday night&apos;s incident&apos; were cabled from here to America, and no doubt given proportionate space in&apos; theAmerican press.   They serve as valuable reminders of the difference betweenAmerica&apos;s situation and our own in relation to the war.8. On balance, we advise against the issue of a request to the press to placeless emphasis on reports of particular big incidents. The incident that gave riseto the present difficulty had exceptional dramatic possibilities and was givenundue prominence for want of other and more significant news. We do not ratevery highly the risk of untoward effect if no further action is taken.n. m.B. B.12th November, 1943.
