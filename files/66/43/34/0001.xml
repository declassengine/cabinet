(43) 534.25th November, 1943./war CABINET.MAN-POWER FOR THE NAVY IN 1944.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE Navy&apos;s original needs for man-power in 1944, set out in W.P. (43) 448and amounting to 247,000 men and 41,500 women, were worked out on the basis that it was unsafe to assume the defeat of Germany in 1944, but that the situation would allow the re-orientation of forces from Europe to the Far East to be started in that year. Furthermore, it was accepted by the Prime Minister and thePresident that planning should aim at accomplishing the defeat of Japan withintwelve months of the defeat of Germany.2. The man-power situation has led to the proposal of a new hypothesis;namely, that the maximum impact should be applied to Germany in 1944, andthat against Japan in 1944 we shall make only our &quot;provisionally agreedcontribution &quot; to operations. This is the hypothesis on which the SinclairCommittee have worked in their report (M.P. (43) 3).3. The Committee propose that the Royal Navy should receive 40,000* menin 1944. The Committee show that this allocation will result in a reduction inthe strength of the Navy from 759,000 at the end of this year to 750,000 at theend of next, i.e., an allocation of 40,000 men would be rather less than sufficientto make good wastage.4. The Admiralty will naturally do their best to secure the largest possibleimpact upon the enemy from whatever allocation is finally made to them.Nevertheless, they are satisfied that an allocation of the order suggested by theSinclair Committee will involve the acceptance of serious strategical risks, andthey consider it highly important that before the War Cabinet decide to accept that particular recommendation, or one in any way approximating to it, theWar Cabinet should be fully aware of the probable consequences of anysuch action.5. After allowing for every possible economy, the Admiralty estimate thatthe Fleet will require, in addition to the 194&quot; allocation in full, 67,200* men ifit is to have a reasonable prospect of fulfilling the minimum tasks arising fromthe hypothesis on which the Committee have worked, i.e., &quot; the maximum impact on Germany in 1944 while fulfilling, so far as they are already planned to hefulfilled in 1944, our agreed contribution to operations against the Japanese.&quot;6. (i) This figure of 67,200 can only be made to cover the minimum require-ments on the assumption that there will be no increase after March 1944 in our naval strength in any category except Fleet destroyers (of which there will always be a chronic shortage) and minesweepers. This will mean that, except in so faras the new ships can be manned by savings from ships lost or from paying offolder ships (in addition to those mentioned in sub-paragraph (ii) below), theywill have to be laid up under care and maintenance until the end of the war withGermany at least. Included among the new ships completing in 1944 will beseven Light Fleet Carriers.* Note. Both of these figures exclude 1,800 men for Merchant Navy training.[26476]
(ii) In addition to the paying-off of new ships completing after March 1944contemplated under (i), the estimated requirement of 67,200 men assumes that thefollowing existing ships will also have to he paid off, in most cases with no provision for care and maintenance :  Capital Ships.Resolution. Royal Sovereign. RamilUes.Revenge. Malaya. Rodney or Nelson.Aircraft Carrier.Furious.Cruisers.Thirteen, including three heavy cruisers, or their equivalent in other types.20 Town Class Destroyers.Minelayer A dventure.Pegasus.Two converted Merchant Ships and a number of Patrol vessels.These cuts are estimated to produce 14,000 men.(iii) The figure of 67,200 also assumes further cuts, some of which will haveto be arbitrary, in shore establishments : estimated saving 11,000 men.(iv) Further, it is assumed that the two Mobile Naval Base DefenceOrganisations will be disbanded, and that (v) Further cuts will be made in the Royal Naval Patrol Service, over and above those in (iii) above, saving approximately 3,000 men.(vi) There will remain certain services which will have to be met out of this figure of 67,200 men :  (a) The provision of personnel on a small scale for Continental bases andcertain highly special tasks requiring a very few men;(b) the adjustment of the complements of existing ships to enable full use to be made of progress in Radar and fire control;(c) the provision of a care and maintenance organisation for the new shipslaid up under (i) (but not for old ships);(d) the provision of all the air personnel for the approved expansion of theFleet Air Arm, but only of such general service personnel as isnecessary to man, on a care and maintenance basis, new carriers andshore stations not required for the war against Germany. this measure is essential, owing to the length of the training period, if thelaid-up carriers are to be used against Japan with the minimumdelay after the defeat of Germany, assuming that this will occur in 1944.7. It will be seen that even the figure of 67,200 men would involve heavysacrifices in many directions. It is undeniable that they would entail risks.One of the most notable would be the loss of training facilities for higherratings through the paying-off of the capital ships and cruisers : this mighthave serious effects in the future. Nevertheless, these risks the Admiralty mustreluctantly accept.8. Once, however, the intake for 1944 falls below 67,200, the risks mountrapidly and these extra risks the Admiralty cannot accept on their own responsibility.9. It is difficult to say what the exact effect of any particular short-fallwould be. Much would depend upon the timing of the major operations contem-plated for next year and this is still uncertain. The position can, perhaps, best be explained as follows : 10. The major naval commitments arising from the hypothesis adopted bythe Sinclair Committee are (i) the protection of sea communications in areas of British Strategicresponsibility (including convoys to North Russia),(ii) &quot;Overlord.&quot;(iii) the support of operations in the Mediterranean.
(iv) our agreed contribution to operations in the Far East, which is assumed in this paper to be &quot;Buccaneer.&quot;(w) the preparation of the F.A.A. for the continuance of our contributionagainst Japan.(vi) such of the services mentioned in paragraph 6 (vi) above as do not fkrwfrom the other commitments just mentioned.11. It is assumed that, of these commitments, &quot; Overlord &quot; is the one inwhich any shortcoming will be least acceptable. The Navy will make every endeavour to see that there is none. But, if we are given less than the number ofmen which we estimate to be the minimum requirement, we may not be left witha free choice as to the detailed disposition of our resources. Suppose, forexample, that &quot;Buccaneer&quot; is launched first. Once committed to it, we arelikely to be faced with demands arising from it which w^ould conflict, particularlyin special categories of personnel, with &quot; Overlord.&quot; In this connection it mustbe remembered that only in the last few weeks have orders been given to increase by 75 the number of Landing Craft to be manned for that operation.12. Conversely, once &quot;Overlord&quot; is launched, it is impossible to foreseewhat demands it may make, or how long they will last. We estimate that if,instead of 67,200, the Navy were to receive only 50,000 in 1944, the overall deficitaccumulating by the end of the year would entail reductions in Fleet strengthsequal to the paying off of Queen Elizabeth, Valiant, Renown (in addition to thecapital ships mentioned under paragraph 6 (ii) ), 12 more cruisers, 24 destroyers and 42 escort vessels. If this reduction bad to fall entirely on the Eastern Fleer,it would mean the abolition of that Fleet. Such ships as remained in the far east would have to be withdrawn to East Africa, Ceylon would have to be abandoned as a Fleet base and we should revert to the 1942 position in the indian ocean before the formation of the Eastern Fleet. In short, the start of our full contribution to the Japanese war would be put back to much more than sixmonths&apos; notice. Obviously, if any substantial part of this deficit had accumulatedbefore the Far Eastern operation were launched, and in the circumstances of themoment had to be taken by the Eastern Fleet, that operation could not take place.13. On the other hand, if the present timetable is adhered to, we might be committed to both &quot;Overlord&quot; and &quot;Buccaneer&quot; without hope of reducing our effort in support of either of those operations for a considerable time. In that case, the short-fall (which would be cumulative until men could actually be released from either of these operations) would be bound to affect one or more ofthe services mentioned in paragraph 6 (vi). If these were spared, then we shouldbe faced with a situation in which the general wastage in the Fleet could not bemade good, and our effective strength would fall in one or more of the theatres of&apos; war. As already indicated, we might not be free to apportion this declineat will, and if in the circumstances at the time it could not be taken out of&quot; Overlord &quot; or the Eastern Fleet, then it would be bound to affect the size of theforces available in the Mediterranean or for the protection of sea communicationsgenerally. For example, it might conceivably be necessary to meet part of the deficit by reducing the number of cruisers in the Home Fleet to such an extent that there would be none available to meet attacks on convoys crossing the bay of Biscay by the Narvik destroyers based on the Bay ports. In view of theextreme importance of these convoys, this is a risk which the Admiralty them-selves consider unacceptable and could not run without Cabinet approval. On theother hand, a reduction in Home Fleet cruiser or destroyer strength might preventthe running of North Russian convoys, supposing that for political or other reasons it were desired to continue them throughout next year, or to revive themtowards the end of 1944 before Germany had been defeated. Again, it might befound that the decline in naval strength here postulated would have to be borne,wholly or in part, by our anti-submarine escort forces. The U-boat picture is satisfactory at the moment; but I must remind the War Cabinet, firstly, that evenif we get 67.200 men in 1944 there will be no increase in our escort forces afterMarch next, and secondly, that so far this year the Germans have built moreU-boats, even if not many, than we have been able to destroy.Any unforeseen contingencies, which have always been plentiful in the past,would aggravate this problem.14. The Admiralty recognise that a very substantial proportion of thedifference between the minimum requirement of 67,200&apos; and the allocation1&apos;ecommended by the Sinclair Committee is represented by the provision which
it is desired to make for the continued expansion of the Fleet Air Arm (seeparagraph 6 (vi) (d) above). It is essential that trained air and maintenancepersonnel should be available for the laid-up carriers if there is to be noundesirable postponement of the date when our forces can be deployed in fullmeasure against the Japanese; it has been generally accepted in the hypothesis that this date should be six months after the defeat of Germany.15. It is the purpose of this paper to show that the allocation which theSinclair Committee propose is not in itself sufficient to enable the Navy to fulfil the conditions of the hypothesis on which the Committee worked as thusinterpreted. In paragraph 10 of their report, the Sinclair Committee admit that a strict interpretation of the hypothesis. would require, not an allocation to the R.A.F. for the year 1944. but a net release of 22,500 men and 23,000 women.The Committee, nevertheless, recommend an allocation of 50,000 men to the R.A.F.solely because, without it, the effects on the R.A.F. combat strength in 1945 wouldbe serious if the hypothesis were falsified by events. The Admiralty do not dissent from this view. They feel, however, that the insurance can be applied evenmore profitably. At present it only insures the R.A.F. against the risk thatthe war with Germany will continue into 1945. It can also be made to insurethe Navy against the opposite risk and the one postulated by the hypothesis that Germany will be defeated in 1944 and that large carrier-borne forces willhave to be sent against Japan as early as possible in 1945. This could be doneby diverting to the Navy sufficient men out of the proposed R.A.F. allocation to meet any deficit on the minimum naval requirement, The Admiralty would undertake that if Germany were not beaten in 1944 these men, or such of them as the R.A.F. needed, would be lent to the R.A.F. for the further duration ofthe war in Europe, after having received naval air training. By this methodone set of men would at the same time provide the necessary personnel for theNavy if Germany is defeated in 1944. and for the R.A.F. if she is not. Noother method would provide so good a two-way insurance for a single premium.16. .* It would be preferable to pay that premium into the Navy because theR.A.F. expansion virtually reaches its peak in 1944, wdiereas the F.A.A. expan-sion will be in full swing. It would, therefore, be simpler and quicker for theR.A.F. to infiltrate a (for them) comparatively small number of trained Navalflying and maintenance personnel into existing squadrons than it would be forthe F.A.A. to take on a (for them) relatively large number of R.A.F. personnelwithout the basic sea training and weld them into new squadrons fit to operatefrom carriers.A.
