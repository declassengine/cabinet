TIiIL ?.^IENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1943.SECRET.GEN 22/2.3rd November, 1943.WAR CABINET.CIVIL AFFAIRS ORGANISATION.OUTLINE OF PROPOSALS.I. Introductory.1. This outline of proposals has been drawn up with primary reference to europe and should be so read. Much the same principles would apply to the far east, but some modifications of the organisation would be required. For example,in the case of liberated Colonies the Colonial Office (and in the case of Burma, the burma Office) would assume the responsibility for political and administrativequestions assigned in this scheme to the Foreign Office. It follows that theCommittee membership set out in Section III would be extended to include theMinisters and Officials of the Departments immediately concerned.Again, the outline of proposals speaks of Control Commissions. this procedure applies particularly to conquered areas, and requires substantial modification in regard to liberated areas.2. Three Stages. We have to deal with at least two, and probably three separate stages.3. The first stage is when military operations are being carried out in an area. The planning of the administration for this stage and its execution is essentially a military function, for which the Commancier-in-Chief must have theresponsibility. The War Office must, therefore, be the responsible department for the first stage of military administration, working in consultation with thepolitical and other Departments concerned.4. The final or third stage comes when the area is no longer of operationalsignificance, and the War Office need no longer be burdened with responsibilityfor its administration. At this stage, the responsibility clearly becomes apolitical matter which should be entrusted to the Foreign Secretary in consulta-tion with other Ministers concerned.5. There is probably also a second or intermediate stage when theadministration of the area passes from the military government to a control commission, which will exercise a less direct supervision. During this second stage, however, the military authorities must retain absolute power over certain questions, e.g., transport facilities or the use of ports; and it follows that duringthis stage the Secretary of State for War must remain the Minister responsible(e.g., vis-a-vis Parliament) for the actions of Control Commissions.At the same time, during this second or intermediate stage an increasing number of questions of political and economic importance will arise, which canonly be settled after consultation with  the Foreign Secretary and other ministers concerned.II. Departmental Organisation.6. In the light of the above, the, responsibilities of the Departmentsconcerned are as follows : The War Office are (i) Responsible for Administration during the military stage,(ii) Responsible for Supplies during the military stage (as defined for thispurpose).(iii) Primarily  responsible  for  Control  Commissions  as  the  organ  of administrative government during the second stage.[26360]0 &amp;Copy No. 10 7
The Foreign Office are  &apos;(iv) Responsible for general external policy and political questions thrownup by Control Commissions,(y) Responsible for post-hostilities Relief, recently taken over from theBoard of Trade.(vi) Primarily responsible for Control Commissions during the third stage.The Ministries of Production and Food and the Relief Department of theForeign Office are responsible generally for (vii) Ensuring the provision of the necessary supplies after the end of themilitary stage, including such supplies as are needed for reviving theeconomic life of liberated and conquered areas, and for securing thebest use of the available resources of these areas in the interest of theUnited Nations. In this field, the Minister of Production acts as thegeneral co-coordinator of the Supply Departments by virtue of hisposition as Chairman of the North American Supply Committee.7. The work over the whole field will be co-ordinated by two Ministerial andtwo Official Committees. It involves the closest day-to-day contact between the sections engaged on the duties set out in paragraph 6. It would be of great assistance, therefore, if all these sections could be accommodated in the same or inneighbourino&apos; buildings.III. British Committee Organisation.8. A Ministerial Committee on Armistice Terms and Civil administration was set up on the 4th August, 1943, comprising the Deputy Prime Minister (inthe Chair), the Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State for War. other ministers attend meetings as and when necessary.*The terms of reference are &quot; To consider and where necessary advise the War Cabinet on mattersof detail and execution connected with armistice terms and instruments of surrender; with the Military administration of occupied enemy territory;with the liberation and handing over to territorial Governments of enemy-occupied territories: and with the discussion of such matters with our allies.&quot;It is proposed that the Minister of Production and the Minister of state should be added to this Committee. The Terms of Reference .do not require modification except in two particulars. First, the word &quot; administration &quot;should be added after &quot; liberation.&quot; Secondly, it should be understood that theCommittee will not handle supply matters to be dealt with by the committee referred to in the ensuing pa paragraph.9. It is proposed to set up a Ministerial Committee on Supply questions in liberated and Conquered Areas A The Minister of Production will be theChairman and the Minister of State the Vice-Chairman (thus ensuring inter-locking with the A.C.A. Committee). Members would include the SupplyMinisters, the Ministers of Food and War Transport, the Secretary of State forWar, the President of the Board of Trade, and other Ministers as necessary.On occasions, no doubt, the two Ministerial Committees would meet together to consider questions affecting both Committees.10. The A&apos;.C.A. Committee would be assisted by a Committee at the official level for the purpose of dealing with matters which require inter-departmentalconsultation, but need not be referred to Ministers, and for preparing material for submission to the A.C.A. Committee.As this Committee would not deal with supply matters, it would be a much        1smaller body than the A.T.E. Committee, which it would replace.   It would bean instruction to this Committee that matters which cannot be settled at theofficial level without protracted discussion should be remitted, without delay, tothe A.C.A. Committee.To ensure liaison, this Committee would have a link on the secretarial levelwith the A.C.A. Committee and with the official Supply Committee, referred to inparagraph 11.* W.P. (43) 350.-j- This committee will necessarily be concerned with questions affecting the Europeanneutrals, and its responsibilities for &quot;supply questions&quot; will be as interpreted in the sense ofparagraph 0 (vii).
11. The Minister of Production proposes to appoint an official committeeto deal with supply questions in liberated and conquered areas. This committeewould comprise members of the Supply Departments, the Ministries of war transport and Food, the War Office, Foreign Office, Board of Trade, and otherDepartments as necessary. It would be presided over by a permanent Chairman,who would be a member of the Minister of Production^ staff, and would be assisted by a strong co-ordinating secretariat, which might also form part of theMinister of Production^ organisation, but would include representatives of theForeign Office and other Departments concerned.It is not proposed that this committee should take over from the War office the responsibilities of that Department in regard to supplies during the militarystage, but the closest touch would be maintained with the War Office in regardto such supplies. For this purpose the War Office have a member on the committee.It is contemplated that work on the estimation of requirements shall be carriedout by working parties, organised as hitherto by the Relief Department of theForeign Office in accordance with general principles agreed by the official committee. Once the scale of Supplies to be provided has been generally agreed,responsibility for placing the resulting demands on the Supply departments would rest upon the Relief Department, so far as the orders were to be financed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.12. None of the arrangements set out in this Memorandum affect thefunctions and position of the Post-Hostilities Planning Sub-Committee, which remain as set out in their Directive (C.O.S. (43) 199).IV. Combined Organisation.13. A Combined Civil Affairs Committee has been set up in Washingtonas an agency of the Combined Chiefs of Staff. At the present time the americans are claiming that all civil affairs matters within the sphere of the combined chiefs of Staff must go through the C.C.A.C. in Washington. They are making this claim even in regard to matters which have been worked out in detail inCommittees in London at which the Americans have observers.The time has come when we should make it clear that we regard this arrange-ment as both unreasonable and inconvenient, so far as concerns European areas,for the following reasons :  14. In the first place, civil affairs are not really matters for determinationby the Chiefs of Staff. Most of the questions raised are of a political nature,and should be settled by reference to the Governments concerned.15. Secondly, it is convenient to deal with them in London, where are mostof the exiled Governments of the European States.16. Thirdly, the planning of operations in Europe is being carried out inthis country-and it is inconvenient that the detailed planning of the related civil affairs questions should have to be referred to Washington.17. In the fourth place, the establishment in London of the tripartiteEuropean Advisory Commission makes London the obvious centre, since itwould be-to this Commission that the political questions, affecting Armistices, &amp;c,would be referred.18. It is therefore proposed that a Combined Civil Affairs Committeeshould be set up in London to deal with civil affairs questions in Europe,including the Balkans.* The British side of the Committee would be drawn from the members of the British Committee set up in paragraph 10. TheForeign Office and State Department would both be represented. So far asEuropean questions are concerned, this would take the place of the C.C.A.C.in Washington.If it is agreed that the London C.C.A.C. should be an official Committee,then provision would have to be made for Anglo-American meetings on the ministerial level. This might be considered in connection with the establishmentof the tripartite European Advisory Commission mentioned in paragraph 17.19. It can, of course, be made clear that we should be ready to agree thatall questions arising on the London C.C.A.C. which have any operationalsignificance should be referred to the Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington* The A.T. (B) Committee in Cairo would be made into a combined body and would work under the general guidance of the London C.C.A.C.
before any final decisions were reached. For the most part, however, questions arising on the London C.C.A.C. would be political, administrative or financial questions, which would be referred, where necessary, to the British, and UnitedStates Governments for decision and not to the Combined Chiefs of Staff.20. The question whether it is necessary to set up in London a fully com-bihed Committee on supplies will require further consideration.21. The proposals set out in Sections II and III of this note are shown inthe diagram attached.Offices of the War Cabinet,Great George Street, S.W.1,3rd November, 1943.
