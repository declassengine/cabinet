This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, December, 1943SECRETW.P. (43) 5482nd December, 1943DEMOBILIZATION OF THE army memorandum BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR WARI. History and Development of W*ar Office Plans.1. Preliminary work upon demobilization problems was begun in the War office in the autumn of 1940. The lesson of 1918 had been taken to heart and it was thought to be prudent to avoid, so far as careful planning could avoid, the mistakes of thatyear which led to unrest and acts of indiscipline.2. Early in 1941 the Ministerial Reconstruction Committee set up an Interdepart-mental Committee of officials to establish the frame-work of a demobilization schemeand to consider the machinery required to put it into effect. In the following May theCommittee issued an interim report embodying a plan based on a scheme of demobiliza-tion priorities depending on the two main factors of age and length of service duringthe war. This plan was endorsed by the Ministerial Committee and further details were filled in by another report of the Official Committee in October, 1942.3. In November, 1942, the War Cabinet considered both reports and gave themgeneral approval as the basis for preparatory work on demobilization planning(W.M. (42) 155th Conclusions, item 5). Shortly afterwards the Paymaster-General(Sir William Jowitt) made a brief statement in the Debate on the Address to the effectthat a plan had been drawn up providing, subject to military needs, for the demobiliza-tion of the forces on a plan based in the main on age and length of service.II. Principles and Machinery of the War Office Plan.4. The guiding principles which have been followed in the War Office and whichare vital to any scheme of demobilization are:  (i) It must be accepted by the Army itself as being fair by and large,(ii) It must similarly be accepted by the general public, including wives, families and dependants of soldiers and potential employers.(iii) It must be simple to administer.(iv) It must not promise more than it can perform.(v) Once approved and announced it must not be altered.5. For the purpose of simplicity and intelligibility it is the War Office view thata scheme of demobilization must be based on the application of broad and well under-stood principles of priority rather than upon any detailed and involved selection of individual classes or types of personnel. The factors of age and length of service inthe present war do, in fact, provide such a broad and well understood principle.6. In considering the merits of the War Office plan itself and of the counter-proposals, to which reference is made below, it is necessary to have an appreciation of the machinery by which the demobilization of the individual soldier will be governed.Here again simplicity is important.   The two fundamental requirements are:  (a) that the War Office, given an order to demobilize, say, 500,000 soldiers, shouldbe able to translate that order into simple instructions to units which will result in that number only being demobilized;(b) that the unit, on receipt of the War Office instructions, shall have no difficultyin carrying them out.For these purposes, at the War Office end of the chain, there is a card index coveringevery member of the Army. The cards (on the punched card principle) are so markedas to enable the demobilization authorities to calculate swiftly and accurately the numerical product of each and every demobilization group. Thus, if at the end of thewar with Germany the Government decides to demobilize 500,000 men from the Army,it will be a simple matter for the War Office to decide and to announce how manyage plus service groups will be affected.Copy No.WAR CABINET
At the other end of the chain is the Officer Commanding the unit. This officer is a busy man wherever his unit is situated. If he is in the face of the enemy he willbe particularly busy, and it is necessary that he should be armed with the most.simpleinstructions and with the means of carrying them out. The means are found in theArmy Book 64 which is carried by every soldier and from which the commanding officer can easily calculate the age and service group into which the soldier falls. the commanding Officer can then select the soldiers falling into the prescribed groups andsend them down for dispersal under detailed arrangements made from the CommandHeadquarters.III. State of Readiness of the War Office Plan and Stages of Carrying ii Out.7. If the War Office plan is accepted it can be put into operation at once (subjectto a period of notice to which I will refer in discussion). The actual execution will fall roughly into three stages:  (a) a decision by the Government as to the number of men who can be demobi-lized having regard to further operational requirements,(b) calculation by the War Office from the central card index how many age plusservice groups will produce that number, and the issue of the necessary orders to Commands at home and abroad,(c) Commanding Officers arrange their men into age plus service groups and onthe instructions of the Command send them for dispersal in the appropriategroups. Forecasts of shipping requirements will have been made in advance by the War Office from the card index.It is worth noting that the two-stage ending of hostilities, if realized, while raisingsome difficult questions, e.g., by the retention of men for the Japanese campaign whowould otherwise be demobilized, will simplify the actual process of demobilization byspreading it over a longer period.IV. Recommendations of Sir William JowiWs Committee.8. In August, 1943, a Committee of Junior Ministers was appointed under thechairmanship of Sir William Jowitt &quot; to carry out a general survey of our demobiliza-tion plans on the basis of a two-stage ending of the war &quot;. The Committee accept,though with some reluctance, the broad hypothesis that demobilization will not beginuntil after the period of notice to which I have referred, and that it is unlikely that more than about half a million men will be available for demobilization during the first six months. But in at least three important respects the Committee are making recommendations which, it is no exaggeration to say, will put the whole demobilizationscheme of the Army and the possibility of its prompt implementation in jeopardy.9. Weight for overseas service. The Committee suggest that in establishingpriorities of demobilization some weight should be given for overseas service, but onlyto those men who happen to be serving overseas at the time of demobilization.The idea of weight for service overseas is not, of course, novel. On the contrary, ithad been examined with the greatest care by the War Office before the Committee wasassembled. Putting on one side the objection which the other two Service Departmentsmay possibly see to this special treatment for the Army, the following objections areimmediate and obvious :  [a] Men who happen to be at home when demobilization begins will, under theCommittee&apos;s plan, not enjoy any benefit from their previous overseas service,though they may have spent three or more years in North Africa, Italyor the Middle East.(b) Sick and &quot;wounded who may have spent a lengthy tour of duty overseas and,after a comparatively short period in hospital and on home service, have again been sent overseas as reinforcements, but have less than, say 12months&apos; overseas on their second tour of service there, would be ruled out.In the War Office view if weight is given for overseas service it must be given forall such service.But there are two overriding factors which make such a proposal inacceptable.First, as regards machinery, the War Office central card index does not, at present,show the periods of service overseas of each man. With the aid of considerable extrastaff, and after six months&apos; work, the index could be made to record these periods.Bui not only would this initial work be necessary, i.e., virtually forming a new index,but the records would need constant revision. In addition the documents at the disposalof the Officer Commanding the unit, namely, the Army Book 64, do not give this information. It would, therefore, be impossible without lengthy preparation for tireOfficer Commanding the unit to be put into the position to know which of the men serving under his command fell into the prescribed groups.
(B43/181)    100   12/43   W.O.P.   .15901In the second place, on the information available it is likely that if weight is givenfor overseas service the proportion of men in the early demobilization groups serving abroad will be markedly increased, that is to say, that of every 100,000 men in thehigher groups a greater number will be found to be in garrisons abroad if weight isgiven for overseas service than would be found if no such weight is given. Two results would follow. First, those units and formations which were nearest the enemy inthe East would be most heavily milked of their personnel to the detriment of the warin the East. Second, the demands upon shipping to bring the men home and to takeout replacements might be so greatly increased as to make the transfer impossible.Thus one of the first principles vital to any scheme of demobilization, namely, that itmust not promise more than it can perform, would be vitiated.Moreover, there are other and less inconvenient ways in which overseas service,as such, might be recognized. It is already recognized in the Royal Navy by theentitlement to foreign service leave, and the other two Services have suggested thatthis entitlement should be extended to them.10. Weight for Marriage. The Committee suggest that additional priority shouldbe accorded to married men and widowers with dependent children.The first proposal would presumably refer only to men married before the date of announcement, or even before some date prior to that. It would presumably be operated by assuming for the purpose of demobilization that any married man was so many yearsolder than his real age.I am not personally convinced that the arguments in favour of earlier demobiliza-tion for married men are sound, and I would observe, first, that there are many men serving overseas who, if &quot;they had not been posted there, would have contractedmarriages at home, and, second, that as a matter of social policy it might be preferable to get the young unmarried men home first. On balance I am opposed to giving anypreference to married men, though as a matter of machinery it would not be difficult todo so given sufficient warning.As regards widowers with dependent children, considerable administrative difficulty would follow from any preference. Children grow up, family circumstances constantlychange and it is not easy to maintain records in a state of current accuracy. I thinkthat these cases ought to be dealt with by individual consideration, since the circum-stances of each case [e.g., as to whether the children are well carel for by a relative)vary so widely. The Army is already accustomed to dealing with these -cases on an individual basis by way of compassionate releases.11. Block Releases. The part of the Committee&apos;s report which has the most serious effect upon the Army&apos;s demobilization plan is that which leaves open the question ofpreferential block releases on occupational grounds. The Parliamentary Secretary tothe Ministry of Economic Warfare has put in a reservation to the report in the formof a strongly worded plea for the considerable modification of the age plus service plan in favour of block releases to industries, such as mining, building, etc.There are without doubt strong arguments on the Parliamentary Secretar3-&apos;s side, butthe plain fact is that the introduction of large scale industrial releases in 1919 was the source of the major troubles and discontent which accompanied demobilization then.If block releases are admitted the numbers so released will be so large as to take up all ormore than the permissible, numbers to be demobilized when the war with Germany is overand the result would inevitably be the suspension of all ordinary demobilizations until theend of the war with Japan. I am quite certain that the surest way to provoke discontentin the Army would be to release large numbers of men on industrial grounds to the prejudice of those whom age and service would otherwise place in a high priority for release.I would be ready, however, to agree that a percentage of key personnel (each case to beconsidered individually) to the extent of, say, 2 per cent. (i.e. 10,000) of the first half amillion released from the Army should be permitted. Beyond this in my opinion it wouldbe most unwise to go.V. Conclusion.12. I therefore ask the War Cabinet to decide that the plan upon which the WarOffice demobilization- scheme has been based, namely that of age plus service, a plan which has been elaborated by experts in the light of the experience of the last war, and theprinciples of which have already been announced in Parliament, should now finally be approved, and that in particular the proposals for block releases should be negatived. I askalso that if the War Cabinet is of the opinion that overseas service as such should receive some special reward, the reward should be found elsewhere than in the field of demobilizationpriority. On the question of weight for marriage, I ask for a decision on the principle. if that decision is in favour of such weight, the precise amount of the weight to be given willhave to be worked out with regard to its likely effect on personnel serving abroad and theconcomitant factors of shipping availability and operational requirements in the Far East.The War Office, P.
