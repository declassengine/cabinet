THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC mAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.&apos; June 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 238.June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this documerWAR CABINET.THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN.Memorandum by the Minister of Information. ,THE &quot;doubts&quot; which the Secretary of State for India ascribes to me inparagraph 9 of his paper W.P. (43) 232 are only the expression of my feeling that an inter-departmental Committee on this subject ought not to be set upunless it can do useful and effective work, and in regard to Home opinion I donot think that it can under present conditions.It is all very well to say &quot; We must educate the British public to regard theJapanese as if they were Germans, and war in the Pacific as if it were war inEurope.&quot; But, while the Japanese remain many thousands of miles away, theGermans have been for three years only twenty miles distant from our shores and,too often, vertically overhead. Interest and feeling follow where friends andloved ones are fighting, and for the time being attention centres of necessity onNorth Africa and what is to come after it in Europe. Lastly, Europe is verymuch a home concern, whereas knowledge of or interest in the Far East is sparselydistributed in this country;Given these conditions I do not think that any Committee could do much to alter the &quot; state of morale &quot; of people in this country. The people have been leftunder no misapprehension by the Prime Minister that it is their duty to turn toand tackle Japan when the time comes, nor, so far as my observations go, is there any general misunderstanding on the subject. Apart from that we can try, asthe Ministry of Information has been trying for some time now, to spread by the medium of lectures and films a wider awareness of the Pacific situation, the achievements and prospects of China, the strategy and geography of the Far Eastarea, &amp;c. : but I do not know that an inter-departmental Committee would take usvery much further towards our goal.B. B.11th June, 1943.[25563]
