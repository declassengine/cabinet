THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1943SECRET.W.P. (43) 226.1st June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.ADMINISTRATION OF LIBERATED AND CONQUEREDTERRITORIES.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT the meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 22nd March, 1943 (W.M. (43)44th Conclusions, Minute 3) I was invited to examine, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, whether the existing arrangements for the administrationof territories liberated as the result of operations by the forces of the united nations were satisfactory or called for amendment.2. Preparations for the administration of countries likely to be liberatedor conquered as a direct result of operations for which the British are responsible,and in which effective Military control is established, are in the hands of the WarOffice, who have had considerable experience in this respect in the territoriesliberated from Italian rule in Africa. Within the War Office a Directorate ofCivil Affairs is being set up to deal with civil affairs questions in all theatres,including the Far East. The necessary liaison is maintained with other depart-ments in London through the A.T. (E) Committee described in W.P. (43) 78 andits Shipping and Supply Sub-Committee. In Cairo the Commander-in-chief has established a similar Committee, known as the A.T. (B) Committee.3. A civil affairs division of the United States War Department has alsorecently been established. This division will be the United States War Depart-ment Agency for all matters other than those of a strictly military nature in enemy territory or enemy-controlled territory occupied as ,a result of military operations for which the United States are responsible. The question of the machinery required to deal with matters relating to the civil administration of territoriesliberated or occupied as a result of combined Anglo-American operations is being actively considered through the machinery of the Combined Chiefs of Staff.Meanwhile, matters relating to civil administration in &quot; Roundup &quot; territories are being dealt with by the A.T. (E) Committee, on which there is some Americanrepresentation.4. It is contemplated that each Military Commander entering territorypreviously occupied by the enemy will have on his staff a Chief Civil AffairsOfficer, who will, on his behalf and under his general authority, assume responsi-bility for the re-establishment and control of civil administration in the liberatedterritory. Local municipal police and other authorities will be utilised as far aspracticable. The Chief Civil Affairs Officer will, however, be assisted by civil affairs Officers who will be specialists in the main branches of civil administra-tion.   Personnel to fill these posts are at present being earmarked by the War&apos;   [25513]
Office in consultation with the appropriate Government departments, and, where necessary, are being trained at a special training centre which has been establised for that purpose. The importance of selecting a good proportion of first-classmen for these posts and of giving them the right kind of training cannot, in myopinion, be over-stressed; and this is an aspect of the matter to which the WarCabinet may wish to draw the attention of all departments concerned.5. In liberated territories, with the exception of the actual combat zones,it will be the policy of the War Office to hand over as soon.as possible to a&quot;territorial&quot; Government the responsibility in whole or in part for civil administration, subject to the necessary safeguards as to military security andlines of communication, thus bringing to an end the first phase during which theCommander-in-Chief is supreme in civil as well as in military affairs. It isconceivable, however, that, in some liberated territories, it may prove impossibleto effect any such transfer for some considerable time. In such cases theresponsibility for civil administration will have to remain with the Commander-in-Chief, since there can, of course, be no question of any liberated territory being-administered by a third party other than a National&apos; Government or a military government established by virtue of military occupation.6. Throughout the period before the setting-up of a &quot; territorial &quot; Govern-ment to which civil administrative responsibilities are to be transferred,responsibility for administration in economic and supply matters, as in other fields of civil administration, will rest with the Military Commander and willbe exercised by him through the appropriate members of the Staff of his ChiefCivil Affairs Officer. As soon as the operational situation in a liberated territorypermits, he may, however, whilst retaining that responsibility, wish to availhimself of such facilities in the shape of both supplies and personnel as the united nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, if it has by then been estab-lished, may be able to provide. It has been agreed that the timing and extent ofany application to U.N.R.R.A. for such assistance would only be decided by theMilitary Commander after reference to the War Office, who would consult theother departments concerned as might be necessary.7. Estimates of the supplies which it will be necessary to make availableto liberated territories in Europe in order to provide the necessities of life and to restore the normal life of the territories have been compiled by the Inter-AlliedCommittee under Sir F. Leith-Ross, which will presumably become the EuropeanCommittee of U.N.R.R.A. as soon as the latter has been set up. These estimateswill be examined through the machinery of the Combined Boards and will betaken into account in production planning. They have also been taken intoconsideration by the War Office in calculating the amount of supplies which itwill be necessary to procure and transport to liberated territories in order toprovide the essentials of life for the civilian population during the period duringwhich this will be a military responsibility. In general, it is not contemplated that separate reserves will be earmarked for liberated territories, whose require-ments will have to be dealt with together with those of other claimants throughthe normal allocation machinery.Whilst the needs of conquered enemy territories will naturaly take second place to those of liberated territories, the A.T. (E) Committee are asking the ReliefDepartment of the Board of Trade, in conjunction with the Ministry of economic warfare, to assist in an approximate assessment of their requirements so far asthey may be relevant to future operations.8. This brief review will serve to show that satisfactory arrangements arebeing made for the administration of countries likely to be liberated or conqueredas a direct result of operations. There is, however, a possibility that invasion ofcertain areas by forces of the United Nations may lead to the evacuation by theenemy of other areas. Under existing arrangements no preparations are beingmade for the administration of territories liberated in this way as an indirectconsequence of military operations although their relief requirements are being-explored by the Inter-Allied Committee and the Relief Department. The WarOffice point out that limitations of man-power render it impossible for them toprovide adequately for the administration of the whole of Europe, and that thefirst call upon our resources must be in respect of those areas directly liberatedby United Nations forces and where our responsibility is thus clear.
There is much force in this argument. Moreover, one may hope that in themajority of cases some form of territorial government would at once emerge, andthat U.N.R.R.A. would be able to provide it with the necessary supplies. Thepossibility of disorder and civil war, possibly promoted or exacerbated by famineconditions, is, however, One which cannot be entirely discounted and which itmight be impossible for us to tolerate for reasons connected both with our prestige and with the security of our communications.Whilst, therefore, I am disposed to share the views of the War Office in thismatter, i feel bound, nevertheless, to draw attention to what may prove to be agap in our preparations.J. A.Privy Council Office,Great George Street, S.W. 1,1st June, 1943.
