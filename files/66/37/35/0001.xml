These documents comprise :  (a) A covering letter dated 9th June, 1943, from the Foreign Secretary tothe Soviet Ambassador. (Similar letters, mutatis mutandis, have been addressed by the United States Secretary of State and the CanadianPrime Minister to the representatives of the U.S.S.R. in washington and Ottawa.)(b) A draft Protocol, for signature on a date to be fixed later, by Plenipotentiaire-tentiaries of the four contracting Governments. It has been agreedthat this Protocol shall be signed in London, since the first twoProtocols were concluded at Moscow and Washington respectively.(c) Three separate schedules of supplies and shipments setting out the storeswhich each of the supplying countries can offer. The schedulesalso contain detailed stipulations governing the conditions of supplyand allocation of tonnage.3o   The operative clauses of the draft Protocol are : (a) Article II the Shipping Clause which restricts the commitments of theUnited States and the United Kingdom by reference to specified con-contingencies, i.e., shipping losses, lack of escorts, deficiencies in the capacity of routes, the necessities of other operations, and the&quot; exigencies of the situation.&quot;(6) Article III the Return Cargoes Clause which engages the U.S.S.R. tosupply such materials as they can towards the war requirements of theother three Governments.(c) Article IV the Financial Clause-which continues the existing arrangements, but leaves the financial issues between Canada and russia to be settled separately.id) Article V-the Variation Clause the. first paragraph of whichempowers the supplying countries to decide between themselves, in the. light of the varying strategic, supply, and shipping situation, by whatroutes and from what sources the various items are to be despatched.This Article also provides for a revision of the schedules in an upwardor downward direction, as circumstances may require.[25544] B
4. The Schedules have been drawn up on the basis of a request for suppliespresented simultaneously on behalf of the Soviet Government to the United StatesGovernment and to His Majesty&apos;s Government on 30th March last. this request has been carefully examined by the two Governments, in consultation between themselves and with the Canadian Government. For the first time, andat her own request, Canada joins in the Protocol as a contracting party. Thepassage of the Mutual Aid Act now enables Canada to supply goods and services to other members of the United Nations for the joint and effective prosecution ofthe war on any terms (ranging from repayment to free gift) which the canadian government deems appropriate.5. Negotiations in Washington with the United States and canadian authorities have been conducted on the British side, under the supervision of theAllied Supplies Executive, by the Minister Resident for Supply, assisted by aCommittee of the British Supply Council.6. The United States schedule offers to make available for shipment4^ million short tons of stores (2,700,000 short tons for shipment in Soviet Flagvessels by the Pacific route, and 1,800,000 short tons for shipment in Americanvessels). The rate of delivery, subject to Article II of the Protocol, is to be225,000 short tons per month by the Pacific and 150,000 short tons per month bythe Northern route or the Persian Gulf. These 4^ million tons are to be selected from a total of 7,080,000 short tons offered in the Schedule.The major military stores include : Aircraft 1,200 single-engine P.39 fighters.1.200 A-20 light bombers.144 B-25 medium bombers.240 C-47 medium transport planes with spare parts.Trucks &apos;10,000 for each of the first six months.12,000 for each of the second six months.24,000 jeeps.3,000 prime movers for Artillery.12,000 motor-cycles.Naval Stores 200 3-inch/50 Naval A. A. Guns.50 20-mm. Oerlikon guns.900 - 50 twin machine guns.7. The Canadian schedule contains offers of propellant, machine tools,medical supplies, aluminium and other metals, and half a million tons of wheat.8. The United Kingdom schedule meets to a substantial extent the Russianrequests which are on a much reduced scale as compared with last year, offers of major military items from United Kingdom production being restricted to anundertaking to provide 300 Hurricanes over the next six months, and a maximum of 3,000 tanks over the year. The exact number of tanks has not yet been*deter-mined, as the Soviet authorities have not made a final choice of the types whichthey will accept, but it may well be that a large proportion of those selected winbe Sherman M.4.A2s., with diesel engines, which the Americans have offered tosupply. The aircraft to be provided over the second&apos; six months remain to besettled in discussions now about to start in Washington.9. The total volume of supplies for which British-controlled tonnagerequires to be allocated should not amount to more than half a million tons overthe year if two-thirds of the tanks are Shermans from United States production.Almost all of this tonnage will be loaded in the United Kingdom for despatch,either by the Northern route, if and when, that is reopened, or, by arrangement with the United States authorities, via the Persian Gulf. In the latter event,the supplies will be despatched through the Mediterranean, subject to places being found in the convoys using that route.10. The goods included in the British schedule do not represent the full extent of the help which we shall extend to Russia during the next twelve months.Ever since the establishment of the Allied Supplies Executive we have always beenready to examine in the most generous spirit any requests.put forward by the
Soviet Government for &quot;extra-Protocol &quot; supplies. We have, in fact, been ableto meet the large majority of these requests, and we propose to continue thispolicy, so far as our resources permit without undue interference with our ownessential needs. We have, for example, undertaken to provide 200 Albemarletransport aircraft and a great variety of other miscellaneous naval, military,air and civil supplies, including tea and other food-stuffs from India and theColonial Empire.A.

However, the United Kingdom reserves the right to limit the size of such individual stockpiles either by control of production or diversion of product or both, when in its judgment such action is in the best interest of thecommon cause.

The foregoing availability will be reduced to theextent that offerings of other parties to the protocol are carried in the shippingreferred to hereinafter.The United States will supply the shipping tonnage which, with the Soviettonnage presently employed, will lift 225,000 short tons per month via the Pacificroute, on the understanding that the turn-around is to be of 75 days&apos; durationand that the United States will lend every assistance to the Union of soviet socialist Republics in order&quot; that this may be achieved, and on the further under-standing that, should any untoward events close the Pacific route to the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics or restrict its use, United States tonnage trans-ferred to the Soviet flag for employment on this route will be used on otheravailable routes to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for lifting protocolsupplies, for the shipment of which the United States is responsible.The United States will undertake to lift by either the Northern route or thePersian Gulf route, whichever in the light of changing conditions proves fromtime to time to be more efficient, a total of 150,000 short tons a month.The foregoing commitments as to shipping will include the movement ofsupplies selected from Canadian offerings and froni United Kingdom offerings of wool and lead originating in Australia and New Zealand, and such suppliesoriginating in North America, as, by agreement between the Governments of theUnited States and United Kingdom,&quot;are to continue to be carried in United Statesvessels, as well as shipments from such sources as may become necessary in meeting the commitments of the United States. All shipping commitments are subject to the provisions of Article II of this protocol.
The Government of the United States offers the following schedule ofsupplies, aggregating some 7,080,000 short tons, from which it will be necessaryfor the Soviet Government to select, as promptly as practicable, a program ofparticular supplies for dispatch which does not exceed the shipping limitationsoutlined above, i.e., 4,500,000 short tons, exclusive of fly-away airplanes, to whichmay be added 500,000 short tons for stockpile and carryover, or a total of5,000,000 short tons. This program should include all cargo to be transported inthe shipping referred to above from the United States, or from other sources,after the 1st July, 1943, including protocol and non-protocol items on hand, on order or to be ordered. Protocol and non-protocol material delivered but notexported as of the 30th June, 1943, will be available for selection within the limitations as to tonnage.It is appreciated that reasonable stockpiles of stores must be maintained inthe United States so that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics can, from month to month, select cargo for shipment that is most needed to meet the ever-changingrequirements of war. However, the United States reserves the right to limit the size of such&apos; individual stockpiles, either by control of production or diversion of product, or both, when in its judgment such action is in the best interest ofthe common cause. In taking such action, due consideration will be given tothe expressed needs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.When production is curtailed or material is diverted, the arrearages in thevarious items involved will be given all possible consideration in conformity withfuture realistic shipping programs, Soviet desires, other urgent war require-ments and reasonable production schedules.The offerings made in the United States&apos; schedule of supplies are subjectto specifications which shall be in accord with current United States&apos; conserva-tion and production practices and practicable and specific material scheduling.The United States stands ready, through appropriate officials, to discuss with Soviet representatives in Washington all detailed questions pertaining tothe schedule of stores and services and any reasonable adjustments that may be.desired.. *A supplementary request has been submitted by the Union of Soviet socialist republics. The offerings in this schedule include responses to this request forcertain of the items. The remainder are under investigation, and information regarding the possibility of supply will be furnished as soon as practicable.Above all, the United States desires again to assure the Union of soviet socialist Republics that it has a full understanding of the vital importance ofthe Soviet front and the urgent necessities of moving supplies to it in the highest possible volume and in the shortest space of time.ARMAMENT AND MILITARY EQUIPMENT.(All Weights in Short Tons.)(Except as otherwise specified, amounts are to be provided in equal monthly instalments as nearly as practicable.)A irplanes.Requested : 8,160.A irplanes :6,000 pursuit planes, &quot; Aircobra.&quot;1,200 light bombers, Type A-20.600 medium bombers, Type B-25.360 transport planes, Type C-46; C-47.Spare Parts:Spare engines : 30 percent of number of planes.Spare propellers : 30 percent of number of planes.Airplane spare parts : 20 percent of value of plane.Engine spare parts : 15.percent of value of plane.Propeller spare parts : 15 percent of value of propeller.Offered:  2,784.
