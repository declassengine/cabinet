THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 205.May 14, 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister Resident in West Africa.I have read all the memoranda collected, in the print entitled &quot; Papers on post-War Commercial Policy,&quot;* and the joint memorandum to the War Cabinet,by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and the President of the Boardof Trade (W.P. (43) 136), and I should like to offer the following observations : (1) An expansionist policy in trade is essential for the United Kingdom andthe British Colonial Empire. If we can be sure of obtaining a large increase inthe volume of world trade, it is worth sacrificing Imperial preference and makingconsiderable concessions in our power to restrict imports.(2) I believe that the International Clearing Union t will be a much morepotent factor in securing this expansion than any Commercial Union. Indeed,I do not believe that any reduction in tariffs will create the desired flow of tradeunless the credit and facilities of the Clearing Union are available. Nor do I see how impoverished and debtor countries could accept and honestly operate theCommercial Union without the security and reinforcement of the Clearing Union.(3) I therefore consider that the Clearing Union, the commercial union andan agreed plan for the International Regulation of Primary Products^ shouldbe treated as an integrated whole.(4) I agree that it is most important, commercially and politically, to carry the Dominions with us.(5) I agree generally with, the Colonial Office memorandum (chapter 9 in&quot; Papers on Post-War Commercial Policy &quot;).(6) As trustees we are in duty bound to pursue a policy which is in the beneficial interest of the Colonies themselves. But I believe that any policy whichincreases the sales of colonial products at a fair price will benefit British industry.Subject to a later observation on Japanese competition, I would prefer, in theinterest of British industry, increased colonial trade with reduced preferences,or even without preferences at all, to a restricted volume of colonial trade withpreference.(7) It is important that the Colonies should have the opportunity of developing simple secondary industries, which are locally economic. They shouldalso be (as under the stress of war they are becoming) more self-supporting in food-stuffs which they can produce economically. Neither agriculture norindustry need or should receive artificial protection; but they should have theright to fair protection against; uneconomic slaughter.This local colonial development will, on balance, benefit British industry.The standard of living and purchasing power of the Colonies will be increased;* Unnumbered, dated March 5, 1943. f Cmd. 6437. % Of.

and their imports will be concentrated more on the kind of finished goods whichthe United Kingdom produces.(8) If we can get a real expansion in world trade, British industry shouldbe prepared to take its chance in world markets. But there is one form of corn-petition which must be treated separately, namely Japanese. The Japanesestandard of living before the war was so low that no civilised country couldcompete with its products. The only effective means of protection was the quota,which was adopted by India and in the Colonial Empire.It would be a travesty of justice if the victorious nations adopted a plan which chiefly benefited Japan. I am sure that all civilised countries would accept special restriction on Japan, provided they had a fair field inter se.S.Achimota, Gold Coast, May 1, 1943.
