Target.Essen......      27/28 518 472Wuppertal    ...      29/30 719 610Wuppertal, with a -population of 411,000, is about 15 miles E. of Diisseldorfand was formed in 1929 by the amalgamation of Elberfeld and Barmen. Themain industrial targets are the Jaegar ivorks (ball and roller bearings) and theI.G. Farben Industrie (chemicals and dyes), and there are four important textilefactories.A blind-bombing attack was made on Essen. The sky-marker flares were clearly seen by the crews. A highly concentrated attack developed; the glow offires reflected on the clouds increased in intensity as the attack proceeded andmany large explosions were observed.The weather over Wuppertal was fine, but there was some industrial haze.The attack was delivered against Barmen; the marker bombs were dropped veryaccurately and were well maintained, enabling the Main Force to deliver a concen-trated attack on the centre of the town. The crews of aircraft which arrived overthe target towards the end of the attack report many explosions, large concentratedfires and dense smoke rising to 10,000 feet.Leaflets were dropped on Paris. Lille, Rouen and other French towns.Intruder patrols were flown over Holland, Belgium and Northern France.Mediterranean.Italy and Sicily.32. The heaviest individual attack of the week was made on Leghorn by92 Fortresses (B. 17) which released 224 tons of bombs.

Three heavy raids were made on the airfield and railway centre atFoggia by a total of 67 Fortresses (B. 17) and 88 Liberators (B. 24); hangars,barracks, and other buildings were hit and set on fire and aircraft on the groundwere destroyed. Enemy opposition to these attacks, all of which were carried out without any escort, was not on a large scale; 16 enemy aircraft were shot down forthe loss of one Fortress (B. 17).- In Sicily the bombers concentrated on enemy airfields. The heaviest attack was made by 55 Fortresses (B. 17) on Comiso. Other airfields bombed wereCastelvetrano, Sciacca, Borizzo, Biscari, Gela and Trapani, a force of between24 and 36 aircraft with fighter escort being engaged in each raid. reports indicate that dispersal areas were well covered by fragmentation bombs and anumber of aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground. Enemy fighters were encountered in fair numbers but met with little success; 22 were destroyed in combat against Allied losses of two bombers and five fighters. Augusta wastwice bombed at night by Liberators (B. 24) and Halifaxes which released 60 tonsof bombs on the harbour installations.Intruder -operations over Sicily were carried out at night by Mosquitoesfrom Malta,Sardinia and Pantelleria.33.

The greatestconcentration of damage, mainly caused by fire, is in the centre of the old town^in the urban districts immediately to the north, and in the dock area to the north-west. In the 45 acres of industrial devastation, 28 factories are involved. Thereis,severe damage to the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. (Dortmund Union) where thef25532] &apos; c
blower house, two rolling mills and a machine shop have all been hit; and toHoesch A.G. where a rolling mills and a large workshop have been partially destroyed, and three sheds and a shop completely wrecked. Other factoriesdestroyed or damaged include electrical firms, engineers, millers, three railwayworks and four breweries. Pithead buildings of two collieries have also been hit.A great many warehouses have been destroyed, both on the quaysides of the inlanddocks, and adjoining the railway on the east side of the town.. In the main passenger station there is severe damage to the main entranceand booking office, and to two goods sheds. At Dortmund Enscheder Bahnhofthere are 2\ acres of severe damage to railway workshops and there are manydirect hits on railway tracks, roadways and canal embankments.The main telegraph offices, the Deusen gasworks, the Dortmund airfield andthe Rathaus have all been damaged, and it is estimated that over 1,600 houses and buildings in the town and its immediate surroundings have been destroyed or damaged.Photographs taken on the 29th May show the attack on the 23rd-24th to havebeen outstandingly successful. Damage is highly concentrated and very severe.A preliminary interpretation shows that the main weight of the attack has fallenround the main station and that important industrial concerns have been affected,including three branches of Hoesch A.G., and Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G.(Dortmund Union). Residential damage is very severe and includes onedevastated area of over 80 acres and several other large areas.Bochum. In addition to damage already reported, a final1 interpretation of photographs shows that, in all. sixteen industrial concerns have been affected,including three branches of Vereinigte Stahlwerke, five engineering works and four collieries. A main line railway bridge has collapsed as a result of at least onedirect hit. Public buildings damaged include the town administrative buildings,the agricultural school and the central prison. Altogether some 400 business and residential buildings have been destroyed and about 280 damaged.Wilhelmshaven. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the28th May shows that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. daylight attack on the 21st Mayconsiderable damage was done to the western half of the Marine Werft Shipyardon both sides of the Bauhaf en and that damage extends to the town area north andsouth.In the Marine Werft Shipyard about eleven buildings are involved, and these include the lathe and joiners&apos; shop, the smithery and joiners&apos; shop, the machineshop, the general stores, the north electric power station and the boiler shop andfoundry.Czechoslovakia.Pilsen. It is now known that in the first attack 200 German soldiers in abarracks at Dobrany were killed.In Nyrany a power station which was a source of supply to the Skoda Workswas hit and is expected to be out of action for a period of two to three months and this caused power difficulties in the works.   A lignite mine was damaged.Italy.. Naples. Photographs taken on the 3rd April showed a very large area of damage&apos;centring on the remains of a large merchant vessel alongside the PontileVittoria Emmanuelle. This vessel had apparently beep blown up and the explosion had destroyed two very large portions of the adjacent quays. two other merchant vessels nearby were damaged by the explosion and a large numberof lighters sunk. Destruction among warehouses was considerable, and at the gas works not far distant only one gas holder of the six apparently escaped damage and other parts of the plant were affected. Many commercial and other buildingsnear the dockside were destroyed. The whole area affected forms a rough semi-circle with a radius of about 1,300 yards from the point of the explosion.On the 4th April a further attack was made by the U.S.A.A.F. and photo-graphs only of a small scale were obtained on the 5th. From these it was seenthat considerable further damage had been caused to the port, shipping. and harbour installations. Three large merchant vessels had been very severely damaged, one having capsized, and the liner Lombardia of 616 feet had received-some damage. The dry docks, the port superintendents office, the GraniliBarracks and Pattison&apos;s Engineering Works all suffered varying degrees of damage.
Grosseto: Photographs taken on the 1st May show that as a result of the attack on the 26th April seven barrack buildings on the north boundary of the airfield have been destroyed, and nine others partly destroyed or severely damaged. In another barracks group opposite the main entrance, one building hasbeen destroyed and four partly destroyed. In addition eight aircraft have been damaged.Sicily.Marsala. Photographs show severe damage over the town and portresult of attacks on the 6th and 11th May. In the seaplane station four buildings have been destroyed and several others damaged. The Fascist Headquarters,wine warehouses, Molo di Ponenti, and boulevards and quays have all been seriously damaged. Many city blocks of business and public property have been destroyed or damaged, and there are many direct hits on roads and railways..Palermo. Photographs taken on the 18th April (covering the town anddock area) show that as a result of the attacks on the 16th and 17th April two areas to the north-west and north of the Gala covering approximately 11 acreshave been three-quarters devastated.
