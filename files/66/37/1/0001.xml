THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT^  Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 190.SECRET. I I Copy No.    gW.P. (43) 201.May 13, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON ELECTORAL MACHINERY.THE Committee was set up, by decision of the War Cabinet at their meetingon the 29th March (W.M. (43) 46th Conclusions, Minute 5), to consider questionsof policy raised by the Report of the Departmental committee (Cmd. 6408)appointed to consider-the possibility of establishing special electoral machinery to meet the situation resulting from war conditions.2. The questions for settlement were summarised in paragraph 8 of w.P. (43) 125.  Our recommendations on these questions are as follows : (a) Will the National Registration system be kept in being for a sufficiently long period to cover a post-war general election?In our view, the answer to this question is &quot; yes.&quot; Even in the unlikely event of food rationing being discontinued as soon as the war ends, it is probablethat the National Registration system will have to be kept in force for thepurposes of military service. We feel no doubt that it would continue to functionat any rate for long enough to cover the period in which the first post-war generalelection would be held.(b) Shall the preparation of the Register for the Armed Forces be started atan early date? Shall, however, the use of this Register be deferred until a date at which it is nearing completion, or shall use be made of itat any by-election, despite the &quot;fact that particulars of a proportiononly of members of the Armed Forces who will be entitled to vote inthat constituency may at that date have reached the electoral registration Officer?The Committee are satisfied that the creation of a Register for the armed forces is essential to ensure that the Armed Forces are put into a position, to casttheir votes (by post or proxy) at any election, no matter what voting arrange-ments may be decided on for civilians. We accordingly recommend that the compilation of an Armed Forces Register should be begun at an early date.It must inevitably take longer to secure the registration of those membersof the Armed Forces overseas than those members of the Forces stationed in thiscountry. In these circumstances, we do not consider it equitable that membersof the Forces in this country, although registered, should not be allowed to voteuntil registration is complete in respect of the remainder of the Armed Forces.We accordingly recommend that members of the Forces should be entitled to voteas soon as their names have been entered on the Armed Forces Register.(c) Shall the preparation of the continuous registration scheme be postponedand treated as a matter for consideration next year at the earliest?We considered this question together with the following question also referred to us : Is the Bill to provide that the system of. voting by the production of aNational Registration Card shall be applied not only to a war-time generalelection, should, one occur, but also to any by-elections? ,We are unable to recommend, either for by-elections or for a possible war-time-general election, the adoption of a procedure whereby a person votes on production&apos; [25424]
of a National Registration Card. Under such a system, with no Registeravailable, it would not be possible for candidates effectively to conduct theircanvass, nor would they be able to send polling cards to voters. These cards notonly indicate the voter&apos;s number on the Register, but also state where he oughtto go to vote; and in their absence we think that a large proportion of voters,especially women, would not bother to vote.We take the view, however, that arrangements should be made to improve themethod of voting at by-elections. We are satisfied, from the information put before us, that it would not be possible in present circumstances, owing to lackof facilities and shortage of man-power, to print Registers conforming; to the continuous system of registration proposed in the Departmental Committee&apos;sReport; but we consider that it would be practicable for Registers to be compiledfor by-elections, based on the continuous registration system, which would beduplicated instead of printed.   The procedure&apos; we have in mind is as follows : Arrangements should be made to set in motion as early as possible the initial stages of the system of continuous registration proposed i.n the DepartmentalCoinmittee&apos;s Report, i.e., the stages by which the necessary material would besupplied by National Registration Officers to Electoral Registration Officersthroughout the country and this material would be kept up to date. We recognisethat this will entail some clerical work, but we think this is justifiable. There. would, however, be no compilation of an Electoral List until a vacancy occurred in a particular constituency. On the occurrence of a vacancy, the registration officer for the constituency would duplicate an Electoral List. It is estimatedthat, in most constituencies, a list so duplicated could be compiled in a fortnight,though in certain remote constituencies Registration Officers might be in need of clerical assistance, and to meet this difficulty it might be necessary to providea reserve of mobile labour. After the list had been compiled, it would be necessaryto provide&apos;for the disposal of claims and objections, and we think that anadditional fortnight would in general be adequate for this purpose, providedthat Registration Officers were given power informally to dispose of these pointswithout the need, as at present, to hold Registration Courts with the right ofappeal to the County Court, or, in Scotland, the Sheriff. . Any claim sustainedwould be entered on a supplementary list, while any objection sustained wouldresult in the erasure of the name in question from the original list. The ElectoralList so amended would become the Register, and it would not be necessary toreduplicate it after claims and objections had been disposed of. In order toensure that a Register will be ready when required and to cover those cases whereits compilation may take a little longer than usual, we think that the Bill should contain provisions to ensure that there shall be some minimum interval betweenthe date at which a vacancy occurs and the date at which a writ is issued for aby-election. We further consider that a three months&apos; residence qualification^1&apos;should be applied to voters at by-elections, and we understand that the machineryoutlined above could cover this point, although it would entail slightly more workfor Registration Officers. The Registers should, in our view, be made availableto the Party Agents.In these circumstances we recommend that there should be legislationproviding for a scheme of continuous registration; that this scheme should beset in motion at the earliest possible moment; and that the proposals of theDepartmental Committee should be modified so as to enable a roneoed Registerto be prepared in any constituency as soon as a vacancy occurs in thatconstituency.We consider that, if there were a war-time general election, it should be conducted on the basis of a roneoed Register, applying to the whole country.Considerable practical difficulties of typing and duplicating would arise, butthey would have to be faced and, in our view,, would not be insuperable.For a post-war general election we think that, provided there is a substantialinterval of time between the termination of hostilities and the date of the election,it should be possible to make arrangements for the printing of an ElectoralRegister.We recommend, therefore, that no provision should be made in the Bill foran election by means of production of National Registration cards.* Since the meeting at which the Cabinet Committee agreed on three months, it has been represented to me that the Departmental Committee recommended two months, that this was an agreed compromise, and that it would be advantageous to accept the DepartmentalCommittee&apos;s proposal of two months. H.M.
(d) Shall the Bill provide for the assimilation of the Parliamentary andLocal Government franchises?Whatever may be the arguments for abolishing in present circumstances the variation between the Parliamentary and Local Government franchises,legislation on this subject would almost certainly be controversial. We think,therefore, that the question of assimilation ought not to be dealt with in a bill dealing with electoral machinery, but should be deferred for consideration whenother aspects of electoral reform, which are also bound to be controversial, fall to be reviewed. It will in any event be necessary to decide this question beforelocal elections are resumed.(e) // the two franchises are not assimilated, should the majority or the minority recommendations of the Departmental Committee he acceptedon the method of preparing the Parliamentary and Local GovernmentRegisters respectively?Since it is recommended that the question of franchise assimilation should be deferred, in our view it is not necessary at present to decide between the twosystems of continuous registration recommended by the Departmental Committeeso long as no provision has to be made for a local government register. It will,however, be necessary to decide between these respective recommendations if itshould eventually be decided not to assimilate the two franchises.(f) Ls it agreed that there shall be no change in the voting age?We are aware that, in the last war, men serving with the Forces were allowedto vote from the age of 19, but we do not consider that, in the changed conditionsof to-day, any departure from the present electoral age would be warranted.(g) Shall the Bill contain provisions as to machinery for redistribution, butprovide that actual redistribution shall wait till a later date?There are obvious advantages in providing permanent machinery to effectredistribution which would enable cases requiring attention to be disposed of as and when they arise. At present, difficulties are allowed to accumulate until they become so widespread and serious that some-ad hoc machinery4 has to be created. We therefore recommend that the Bill should contain provisionscreating the permanent redistribution machinery recommended in the Report ofthe Departmental Committee.We have considered the recommendations made in the Report regardingpossible redistribution procedures in war-time. Under this head the Report makestwo alternative recommendations. First, it suggests the completion of a full redistribution-tribution scheme on a 1939 basis, supplemented by the later revision of individualconstituencies if this should be necessary. It recognises, however, that there might be serious obstacles to a full redistribution scheme being effected in war-time and draws attention to the labour which would be required for this operation.Alternatively, it suggests that it might be possible to carry out a redistributionin the light of conditions existing in 1939, but limited to those constituencieswhich by 1939 had already exceeded the acceptable limits of ideparture from the.average and by using all reasonable means of circumscribing the effect of changes made. Under this latter procedure a comprehensive redistribution of allconstituencies in conformity with Local Government boundaries would be reservedfor the more settled conditions which may be presumed after the first post-wargeneral election.After full consideration we were unable unanimously to recommend theadoption of either of these two suggested procedures. A small majority of the,Committee considered that some measure of redistribution should be adopted! \forthwith in order to remove the anomalies which are at present notorious in] Icertain constituencies. A minority of the Committee considered that any such&apos;step in war-time would be incomplete and unscientific, and would caus^controversy and party dissensions which would outweigh any direct advantage to be obtained from such action. &apos;We accordingly feel that we must leave it to the War Cabinet to decide whether any steps should be taken to carry through some measure of redistributionin war-time.3.. As it is possible that circumstances may arise which cannot at present be foreseen and which may affect any proposed electoral procedure, we recommend
that a provision should be included making the Act capable of amendment byorder. Such orders should be subject to the maximum Parliamentary control, andshould, we think, require approval by an affirmative resolution of Parliament.4. An undertaking has been given that a statement will be made inthe House of Commons at an early date. I attach, in the Appendix to this paper, a draft of the statement which I am proposing to make.Signed on behalf of the Committee :HERBERT MORRISON.May 13, 1943.APPENDIX.Electoral Machinery.Draft of a Statement to be made by the Home Secretary.The Departmental Committee on Electoral Machinery has recommendedthat, for the purposes of a post-war General Election, there should be preparedan Armed Forces Register to enable members of the Forces and Merchant Seamento vote either by post or by proxy, and that, as regards.civilians, each electoral registration Officer should be notified through the National Registrationmachinery of the voters residing in his constituency, and kept informed throughthe same machinery of arrivals and departures. By these means the material forcompiling an electoral register for each constituency can be kept continuously upto date. The Government propose to submit to Parliament the necessary legis-iation to enable effect to be given to this scheme, and as soon as the scheme is inoperation it can be used not only for a General Election but for any by-election.It would not, however, be practicable for the purposes of by-electionsoccurring during the war. to print electoral lists for every&apos; constituency throughoutthe United Kingdom. Such a task would involve a greater diversion of man-power than could be justified under war conditions. The plan contemplated isthat when a vacancy occurs the Electoral Registration Officer for that particularconstituency shall prepare from the material already supplied to him an electorallist by a process of typing and multiplying; that the Business Piwuses qualifi-cation shall be obtained by claim; that claims and objections shall be dealt with,swiftly by the Electoral Registration Officer under a simplified procedure; andthat the list, with such corrections as may be effected in this way, shall become the electoral register for the by-election.When this scheme is in operation it will provide effective machinery toenable votes to be given at any election by persons who have attained the age of 21.If they are in the Armed Forces or Merchant Navy, they will have been registered in the appropriate constitutency and will be able to vote by post orby proxy. If they are civilians, they will be entitled to vote for the constituencyin which they are residing, provided they have been resident there for a specifiexdperiod. For this purpose it is suggested that a period of three (? two) months would be appropriate.Time will be required to complete the arrangements by which the national registration Officers will notify each Electoral Registration Officer of the civilians resident in his constituency, and for compiling the Armed ForcesRegister, but every effort will be made to hasten the preparation of the Bill andthe subsequent administrative arrangements.[It will be necessary to add a statement about redistribution. The termswill depend on the War Cabinefs decision.]
