WAR CABINET.SHIPPING.Note by the Prime Minister.THE following letter on the subject of shipping has been sent to me by thePresident.(Initialled) W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,7th June, 1943.The White House,Dear Mr. Prime Minister, Washington, May 28, 1943.WHEN you were with us during the latter part of December 1941 and thefirst few days of 1942, after we had become active participants in the war, plans for a division of responsibilities between your country and mine became generallyfixed in certain understandings. In matters of production, as well as in othermatters, we agreed that mutual advantages were to be gained by concentrating,in so far as it was practical, our energies on doing those things which each of us was best qualified to do.Here in this country in abundance were the natural resources of criticalmaterials. Here there had been developed the welding technique which enablesus to construct a standard merchant ship with a speed unequalled in the history[25545]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1943. \ ^ 4&quot;9 OSECRET. Copy No. ^ ^W.P. (43) 234.7th June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document
of merchant shipping. Here there was waiting cargo to be moved in ships to your Island and to other theatres. If your country was to have carried out itscontemplated ship construction program, it would have been necessary to movelarge tonnages of the raw materials that we have here across the Atlantic to yourmills and yards, and then in the form of a finished ship to send them back to our ports for the cargo that was waiting to be carried.Obviously this would have entailed a waste of materials and time. It wasonly natural for us then to decide that this country was to be the predominantcargo shipbuilding area for us both, while your country was to devote its facilities and resources principally to the construction of combat vessels.You, in your country, reduced your merchant shipbuilding program and directed your resources more particularly to other fields in which you were more favourably situated, while we became the merchant shipbuilder for the two of us and have built, and are continuing to build, a vast tonnage of cargo vessels.Our merchant fleet has become larger and will continue to grow at a rapidrate. To man its ever increasing number of vessels will, we foresee, present difficulties of no mean proportion. On your side, the British merchant fleet hasbeen steadily dwindling. Depending upon the way in which the calculation ismade, it has shrunk somewhere between six to nine million deadweight tons sincethe war began, and you have in your pool as a consequence about 10,000 trainedseamen and licensed personnel. Clearly it would be extravagant were this bodyof experienced men of the sea not to be used as promptly as possible. To fail touse them would result in a wastage of man-power on your side, a wastage ofman-power on our side, and what is of equal importance, a wastage of shipping facilities.  We cannot afford this waste.In order that the general understanding that we reached during the early days of our engagement together in this war may be more perfectly carried out,and in order, as a practical matter, to avoid the prodigal use of man-power and shipping that would result from pursuing any other course, I am directing theW.S.A., under appropriate bareboat arrangements, to transfer to your flag for temporary wartime duty during each of the suggested next ten months a minimum of fifteen.  I have, furthermore, suggested to them that this be increased to twenty.We have, as you know, been allocating to the British services on a voyage-to-voyage basis large numbers of American-controlled ships. What I am nowsuggesting to you, and what I am directing the W.S.A. to carry out, will be inthe nature of a substitution, to the extent of the tonnage transferred, for theAmerican tonnage that has been usually employed in your war program. Thedetails of the arrangements we can properly leave to the national shipping-authorities for settlement through the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board,whose function it is to concert the employment of all merchant vessels and will,in accordance with its usual practice, do so in connection with these particularships.Always sincerely,FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.
