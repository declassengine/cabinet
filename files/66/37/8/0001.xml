(43) 197 of the 10th May, 1943,on the above subject,- I attach extracts from a letter from General Headquarters,India, dated the 26th February, 1943.A copy of this letter, which is addressed to the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, only reached me after I had written my memorandum. It contains asummary of the main events and developments in the India Command betweenNovember 1942 and February 1943.The extracts show that Congress activities had had little effect upon indian troops and that their morale continued to be good, although they were concernedby the economic situation and its effect upon their families.The extracts bear out what I stated in the first paragraph of my memorandumof the 10th May that no bad situation has so far actually arisen in regard to the morale of Indian troops, and stress the importance of the economic factor towhich I drew attention.L. S. A.India Office,May 17, 1943.Extract from G.H.Q., India, Letter dated February 26, 1943.Morale.34. Morale amongst both British and Indian troops in the Army in Indiacontinues to be good, and in certain field formations may be fairly described as high. The present Allied offensives in North Africa, Russia and South-west pacific, combined with the feeling that the United Nations are daily becomingstronger in man-power and material, have had a heartening effect, especially on british troops.35. The improved political situation, which has relieved practically alltroops from Internal Security duties and has, consequently, permitted a returnto normal training, has been welcomed. This, combined with the introductionof the green envelope, the free air-mail letter-card for Christmas, mobile cinemas,canteens, and a marked extension of welfare work in general has helped to keeptroops in good spirits. Indian units have welcomed the introduction ofregimental reading rooms, War Information rooms, and Brains Trustdiscussions.Copy No.[25451]
36. Troops are, however, concerned over high prices, which primarily affectjunior married personnel, and shortages of staple commodities, which exert their most marked effect upon the families of Indian troops. There is universalbitterness against profiteers.39. Congress activities have had very little effect upon Indian troops, andtheir &quot;grouses&quot; are mainly economic. The effect of the food situation hasalready been mentioned; other factors are complaints, mainly relating to ruralpost, offices, of delays to family allotments and mail, the charging of: unauthorisedcommission by petty officials on money orders, difficulties over road travel resultingfrom the petrol shortage, and annoyance and even hardship over the all-prevailinglack of small change.
