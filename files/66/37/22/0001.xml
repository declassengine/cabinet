Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 222.2Qth May, 1943.WAR CABINET.GERMAN MORALE IN TUNISIA.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister ofInformation.WE circulate for the information of our colleagues the annexed notes on thePsychology and Morale of German troops in Tunisia prepared by Major Con0&apos;Neill of the Political Warfare Mission in North Africa. Major 0&apos;Neill&apos;snotes were prepared last month before the last battles had been fought.&quot;       A.    E.    ;    &apos;B. B.2Qth May, 1943.Psychology and Morale of German Troops.1. The average.The main impression made by German troops is their extraordinary stupidity,indifference, docility and patience. They have forgotten how to think. They arephysically tough and mentally calloused. . They have become so accustomed to theprivations, hardships and dangers of war that they have ceased even to be aware ofthem as of anything exceptional. They are docile and patient to an extraordinarydegree. They expect to go for days without food, and make no complaint. they expect to be ordered by their officers to die where they stand rather than withdraw,and they do so. They are physically exceptionally hard. It is their combination of long experience, great physical toughness and absolute uncomplaining docilitywhich makes them, under their good leaders, such formidable soldiers, even thoughthe morale of most individuals, judged by our standards, is very low indeed.They take no interest whatever in politics, and very little even in events. Theyhave a maddening escapist modesty. Most prisoners, if asked to express an opinion about the course of the war, reply : &quot; What have things like this to do with a simple soldier such as me %&apos;&apos; They rather pride themselves on this general attitude of ignorant patience and docility. Their traditional description of themselves is: &quot; Stur wie die Panzer &quot; (stolid as the Panzers). The word&apos;&apos; stur &apos;&apos; is always on their lips.Two stories to illustrate their docility and indifference. A prisonercommented on the fact that some Italian soldiers with whom he had been billetedhad, when given poor food, shouted and rattled their mess-tins till their officersgot them something better. The prisoner rather admired these tactics, but said :&quot; We Germans would no more dream of doing that than of striking an officer.&quot;Another prisoner, unusually intelligent, had spent some time in a big transitbarracks in Tuids,&apos; full of German troops. On the wall were pinned up copies ofthe daily German Wehrmachtbericht and the German short-wave news programme.He had watched for some time and had not seen a single German soldier look ateither. This is evidence not-or certainly not primarily-of scepticism, but rather of sheer brutish indifference.;.      [25494] b
It is interesting to observe the contrast between German prisoners and thePoles or Slovenes in German units who are captured here, or desert in somenumbers. The latter are often full.of life, energy and curiosity. The germans are dull and wooden to an extraordinary degree..What these German prisoners want is always the same peace, and to gohome. They are usually very pleased indeed to be taken prisoner, and alwaysready to admit that they have &quot; Die Schnauze voll &apos;*&apos;&quot; (are &quot; fed-up &quot; to the teeth).But none of them has ever thought that it is only his patience which standsbetween him and peace. None has ever dreamed that he has any choice but to goon suffering and dying for as long as his leaders demand it.On the whole, when forced to consider the war, they are pessimistic. Itwould be untrue to say that the majority realise they can no longer win it; butit is a near thing. Those who realise they will actually lose it are a minority of perhaps 20 per cent. leaving out of account the Poles, Slovenes, &amp;c, and theA ustrians.They have ceased altogether to think of themselves as individuals. Theirindifference seems to extend, often, to the sufferings of their families at home.They take it all as a necessary part of their fate, which they don&apos;t like, but against which they, as individuals, neither can, nor should be expected to, do anything.2. The exceptions.The above average picture is deliberately overdrawn to emphasise the norm.There are exceptions.   They are considered under the following headings : (a) Age Groups. Older men are on the whole more discontented thanyounger and quite a high proportion of combatant German troops out here(% 25 per cent.) is over 30. They are more capable of reasoning than the youngerones.. But at the other end of the scale it is possible just to perceive a gleam ofhope. The 19-year-olds also numerous- are, if anything, less enthusiastic forthe war than those in their middle twenties.(b) Married Men. ^These are more anxious than the rest to. get the war over,and more ready to consider the war in individual terms. But they are corres-correspondingly less ready to take the risk, e.g., of deserting, for fear of reprisals ontheir families.(c) Old Soldiers. Men who have been with the army uninterruptedly for or 6 years and there are not a few such-are noticeably more critical than therest.   Their exasperation has stung them into thought.(d) Enthusiasts. Now and again, in all units, you get a typical 1940prisoner &apos;&apos; I leave it all to my beloved Fuhrer, and he will astonish you yet.&apos;&apos;But this sort of confidence and defiance is exceedingly rare among prisoners fromaverage units, and by no means universal among those from some of the crackregiments and some of the very best&apos; troops in the German army, e.g., theHermann Goring Parachute Regiment are here. In general, most prisoners are ready to talk freely on all subjects, military and political. The N.CO.&apos;s, thoughby no means always, are apt to be more reticent, but this is from a sense of dutyrather than because they think differently from the rest. It may here be mentioned that the status of N.C.Os. in the German army, from Unteroffizierupwards, is carefully preserved and distinguished. The ordinary soldier isconscious of a very considerable gulf between himself and his section leader. Ifyou could undermine the status and the loyalty of the Unteroffiziers you wouldhave gone half-way to destroying the German army.(e) Austrian Troops. These deserve a paragraph to themselves,(f). Foreign Elements. So do these.(g) Deserters. And these.3. A attitude to Russia.There is a painful unanimity among German troops on this subject, and itis very rare to find, a prisoner who does not accept in full the present german propaganda&apos; about the Bolshevik menace to European civilisation, and who doesnot agree with Goebbels that every degree of sacrifice and suffering is preferable to defeat at the hands of Russia. There is a general and vague, but very real,dread of the consequences which this would involve. It far outweighs anyanxiety that may exist^-iand it is often hard to trace any at all- as to the revengethat the peoples of occupied countries might take on Germany were she to be defeated.    The experience of German soldiers on the Russian front and
probably at least 50 per cent, of those serving in von Arninfs army have beenthere has only reinforced these convictions. The ordinary German soldier&apos;spicture of Russia is of a country incredibly primitive and, above all, dirty,inhabited by savage, barbarous, verminous and incalculable creatures, who fightwith astonishing tenacity and violence, who use every unfair and uncivilisedmethod of warfare, and who are always able, though you kill a million, to.replace them with a million more. They feel themselves as soldiers incomparably superior to the Russians, and they can&apos;t understand why they have not beaten them.Indeed, they feel they have beaten them a hundred times, but though the russians are dead they won&apos;t lie down. All Germans recognise that Stalingrad means themost serious crisis of the war so far; but it has served.only to increase their dreadof a Russian victory and therefore their determination to fight on against Russiaanyway. They dread the thought of Russian captivity, and all seem to believethat the Russians kill or mutilate their prisoners. Even men who have desertedto us here assert they would have gone on fighting to the death had theybeen in Russia. T have yet to find a prisoner here who is ready to express anvsympathy for Russian political ideas.4. A attitude to England.Very different. Almost all Germans still hope for, and still believe in thepossibility of, a compromise peace with England. They have a respect for uswhich they believe we reciprocate. They are even ready,to regard us as fairlygood soldiers; and each prisoner repeats : &quot;Die Englander sind Kulturmenschen,nicht Tiere wie die Russen &quot; (the English are civilized beings, not animals likethe Russians). One prisoner even observed that in his opinion we always.fought&quot; Kameradschaf tlich &quot; ! (in a comradely spirit). There is very little trace ofbitterness resulting from our bombing &quot; es ist eben Krieg &quot; (it is just war) isthe usual reaction but one P.W. who experienced the raid on Berlin, on the2nd March observed that the Berliners were very embittered as a result. As heappeared to dislike them cordially himself, this may be reliable. They do notrealise that we are determined to make no agreement with them of any kind.5. The German soldier and the news.German soldiers on this front are incredibly badly informed about the warin general. They never hear wireless; they sometimes, but by no means always,get the daily Wehrmachtbericht read.to them; they get old newspapers fromGermany; they get very irregularly a daily paper published for them in Tuniswhich contains next to no news but mostly a lot of trashy feuilleton stuff. Itprobably well reflects their taste, for the fact is that they take little interest evenin events which affect them profoundly. As an intelligent prisoner observed,&quot; Der Landser ist so stur gewprden, dass wenn nach dem Kriege eine neueRegierung in Deutschland an die Macht kommen sollte, er wurde es einf ach nichtmerken.&quot; (The footslogger has grown so stolid that if a new Government came into power in Germany after the war, he simply would hot notice it.)6. Religion.It appears to be true that religion is coming to play a more important partin the German soldier&apos;s life than before the war. Most will admit as much: but an unusually high proportion of German troops on this front are&apos; fromCatholic parts of Germany. The German army makes very little concession toreligion. In Russia, there seems to have been one chaplain per Division. Herethere appear only to be one or two in base hospitals, and none at all with thetroops.7. Casualties.(. It is not the case that German soldiers as a whole, even those who have servedlong in Russia, have the feeling that Germany has suffered appalling casualties.Most will admit they have been severe; few will believe Hitler&apos;s recent figureof 542,000; but almost as few.would be ready to agree, that the total of german war dead can be over 1,.500,000. Most think.it must be about a million. Therehave been a few prisoners thinking otherwise, including one deserter obsessedwith the slaughter of his generation. But in general they do not think of their losses as appalling, and. in any case regard them with the same brutish indiffefehcewith which they confront all subjects.[25494] b 2
8. Air raids.While not denying that very severe damage has been caused, most prisonerstake this as1 all in the War&apos;s work. Indignation is almost entirely absent, orthreats of revenge. Most prisoners readily admit that they began the large-scalebombing of big cities. One new moral consequence of our raids on germany was suggested by one P.W., who seemed to welcome them. If your home was destroyed or your wife killed, at least you got a chance of compassionate leave.9. Wounds.There is a surprising dread of being seriously wounded and crippled amongGerman soldiers. This is due probably to the fact that men with no legs or noarms have become a common sight in Germany since the Russian war began.Most prisoners declare with apparently sincere conviction that they would ratherhave been killed than crippled. While there may be a sexual element in this, thereason given is always : &quot; What chance has a cripple of getting a job and soleading his own life after the war?&quot;10. Distrust.German soldiers distrust one another. Even when two men are alone in a weapon-pit for days, as like as not the one will not dare tell the other what hereally thinks and feels, if his feelings are at all unorthodox. Each suspects theother may be a &quot; Spitzel &quot; (an Informer). There is a strong consciousness of&quot; Spitzel &quot; within the unit, though few P.W. are able to suggest just whatindividuals may be filling this role. There is an equally strong realisation thatthey fight - under a perpetual &apos;&apos; Druck and Zwang &apos;&apos; (pressure ana compulsion)from officers and N.C.O.&apos;s, but most seem to regard this as normal.11. Officers.There is no trace of a general cleavage between officers and men. The attitudeof the men towards the officers depends entirely on the merit of the latter. Onthe other hand, many men out here have almost no contact with officers. ManyGerman infantry battalions here have six officers only CO., Adjutant,4 Company Commanders. This increases the importance of the N.C.O.s&apos; position;and, on the whole, their morale and influence remains good. A bad, incompetentor over-severe officer is always disliked, and the morale of his battalion or companysuffers accordingly.12. Politics.Very few soldiers have any interest in politics of any kind. Even thoseold enough to remember the pre-1933 parties or trade unions take little interestin them. Very little adulation of Hitler or other leaders. There is much morereadiness to indulge, or at least concur, in disparaging comment on national socialist personalities than there was two years ago. But here again that attitudeOf bleak and stubborn indifference, of patience, ignorance and conscious personalinsignificance, recurs and predominates.13. Propaganda.It is worth mentioning that propaganda in battle is no new idea to theGerman soldier, at least to those who have fought in Russia. They could scarcelyimagine a campaign without leaflets, for in Russia they seem to have been literallydrenched with them at all times. And with no effect whatever, if they are tobe believed. In view of their general attitude to Russia this seems credible;and it certainly appears that virtually no steps were taken in Russia to stop themreading leaflets. Their officers seem to have had complete confidence in theirimperviousness to Russian propaganda.14. Foreign elements.There is a considerable proportion of Slovenes and Poles--especially thelatter-among German troops in Tunisia. Many infantry battalions have or hadup to 6 or 7 per cent, of Poles. The Germans are conscious of their presence asa weakness, and it reacts adversely to some extent on their own morale. ThePoles themselves are all anxious to desert. Many have managed it, but to find the opportunity is not easy.  They are carefully watched.
15. Deserters.The number of deserters from the German army in Tunisia has beenastonishingly high. At a guess it totals well over 100 already, though of thesesome 40 may be Poles. Probably at least 20 more were Austrians. They havedeserted for different reasons, but chiefly because they are simply utterly fed up with the war. Desertion has been the deliberate intention of some ever since they came to Africa; for there is almost no apprehension of bad treatment by us.But desertion is not easy to achieve, and demands a man of some resolution.Undoubtedly many married men are deterred from deserting only by the fear that, were they known to have deserted, their wives would lose all allowances andmight suffer in other ways. It is, however, certain that.many are waiting theopportunity, if not to desert, at least to get themselves taken prisoner at the first opportunity. The margin between deserters&apos;and. prisoners has already often been difficult to define, and it will become more so.16. Austrians.There is a most remarkable difference between the morale of German and of austrian troops. The Austrians are like beings from another world. They canthink, laugh, criticise, argue and discuss. They are almost all convinced thatGermany has lost the war one man described how, when he was last in Viennaand asserted the contrary, he was simply laughed out of court by all his familyand friends and they do not seem to care much. They do not this is the mostimportant distinction feel themselves implicated in Germany&apos;s fate. They donot, good Catholics though they are, share Germany&apos;s horror of Russia andBolshevism. They think that after the war Austria will &quot; get away with it,&quot;and in some vague fashion become independent and happy again. I have yet tomeet an Austrian prisoner who wants to maintain the &apos;&apos; Anschluss &apos;&apos; withGermany after the war. I have been surprised at the number who have spoken of &quot; Kaiser Otto &quot; as the solution of Austria&apos;s problems -all simple privatesoldiers, &quot;or N.C.O.&apos;s. They feel they have no quarrel with England. They havebeen much the most effective subjects for propaganda so far.17. Morale.The morale of the German soldier as an individual is bad; nevertheless, itis not as an individual that he is formidable. The fighting force which hecomposes is still immensely strong. But the strain to which its parts, theindividual soldiers, are being subjected, and will be subjected, in this campaignare great. He has had more than enough of war already; he wants above all elseto go home perhaps rather to have the assurance of going home one day; he isdoubtful, to put it no higher, of his country&apos;s victory; he is fighting here against an enemy whom he does not dread, and whom he respects; he is far away fromGermany, on the wrong side of the sea, and he is nervous of the sea; he is beginning-to see that things in Tunisia are going wrong for his side. It is his duty to fight to the last man and the last round, and in Russia he has oftendone so. There he might do so still. Here he probably will not. He is beginning to think in terms of the personal advantages he will gain by not doing so. He is beginning to think of this battle as uneven, and thus trying to justify the surrender he has half decided on.
