THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT ---.-.-    2 i iPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET. - / Copy No.    33W.P. (43) 249.17th June, 1943.WAR CABINET.if.ALLIED GOVERNMENTS IN LONDON.    PUBLICATION of newspapers AND BROADCASTING.Note -by the Minister of Information. .IN compliance with the conclusions of the War Cabinet on the 27th April(W.M. (43) 59, Minute 1 (3)), I circulate herewith a memorandum about thepolicy and future practice of the Government in regard to journals published in this country by foreign Governments or Authorities resident in London. Thememorandum covers all foreign language papers published in this country withthe support of the Ministry of Information, whether published, by governments and official organisations or by private persons and groups, for the problems raisedare common to them all.The proposals in paragraph 7 are endorsed by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, with whom the matter has been fully discussed.2. The position in regard to broadcasting is that the B.B.C. has enteredinto agreements with a number of Governments whereby, certain periods areallotted to them daily for the expression of their views to their people. Allmaterial transmitted during these periods is subject to policy and security control by the B.B.C. Policy control is based on direction from the Political WarfareExecutive and security control on the censorship regulations laid down by theMinistry of Information. While difficulties have occasionally arisen with theGovernments concerned, the&apos;Foreign Secretary and I are agreed that the presentsafeguards against abuse are adequate and we clo not recommend any change inthe present policy.B. B.17 th June, 1943.FOREIGN LANGUAGE JOURNALS.In the past three years the Ministry of Information have provided facilitiesfor the publication in this country of some 70 foreign language journals and periodicals. These facilities have been granted usually at the request of an AlliedGovernment, but sometimes at the request of a British Government Department.Only four of these journals are dailies and twelve are weeklies; the remainderare published either fortnightly or monthly or even less frequently. Thirteenseparate languages are involved and the publications are variously devoted toliterature, culture, news and politics. A number are produced solely for sectionalinterests, e.g., a paper for Norwegian merchant seamen produced with the supportof the Ministry of War Transport. The total consumption of paper is relatively small about 170 tons a quarter, which is -05 per cent, of the total consumptionof this country.2. Security censorship is covered under the existing voluntary system, buteffective political censorship in advance of publication would involve staff andadministrative problems of such magnitude that we have not regarded it aspracticable. The introduction of political censorship would put these foreignpapers under a regime different from that which applies to British papers and periodicals, and would saddle His Majesty&apos;s Government with responsibility for anything which might appear in them. This would be a very awkwardresponsibility.[2558*6]
3. Short of pre-censoring the whole output of each publication, it isimpossible to keep an immediate check on. the day-to-day output. We can,therefore, only learn of an indiscretion after the event: too often through theprotest of some outraged Ally. Hitherto there has been no staff regularly chargedwith the duty of reading the foreign language output, but the Foreign Office haveagreed to make available the services of the Foreign Office Research Departmentto review and report periodically on all foreign language newspapers and periodicals published in this country and to make recommendations for summaryaction when it appears that any one of them has transgressed certain lines of conduct which, as temporary residents enjoying Government facilities, they may reasonably be expected to observe.4. Indiscretions of a foreign organ such as would justify the intervention of His Majesty&apos;s Government may be held to fall under three main heads :-(a) Attacks on its own Government or National Authority carried to a pointcalculated to impair that Government or Authority&apos;s power tocontribute to the war effort of the United Nations.(b) Attacks on another member of the United Nations likely to prejudicegood relations and by so doing impede our common war effort.(e) Attacks on the Government of this country.5. There is no general power in His Majesty&apos;s Government to suppresspublications except under a Defence Regulation (2 (c) and (d)), which would be unlikely to apply to these cases. Intervention by His Majesty&apos;s Government couldonly take the form of summary revocation by the Ministry of Supply of thelicence to publish which is required for all papers and periodicals first published in this country since the 16th August, 1940. That date covers all except a few of the publications concerned. I understand that the Ministry of Supply is willing to act in these matters on the authority of a recommendation from theMinistry of Information, backed where necessary by the concurrence of any othersponsoring department.6. I do not advocate the suppression of any existing journal for recentindiscretion, although if repeated they would certainly render it liable to actionin the future. The lack of any comprehensive review in the past makes it difficultto be sure that we should be acting with fairness It is better to overlook the pastwhile making clear our intentions for the future.7.   I propose, therefore :(a) that they should be formally warned in writing that, in the interests ofthe cause of the United Nations, His Majesty&apos;s Government will infuture require a proper measure of restraint to be observed by all foreign publications appearing in this country, and that failure todo so will expose those publications to summary revocation of theirlicences to publish or withdrawal of any supplies of paper from theMinistry of Information ration. At the same time they should be reminded that they can always obtain advice and guidance from theMinistry of Information.(b) that a systematic survey of foreign language newspapers and periodicalspublished in this country be undertaken by the Foreign Office, whowould arrange to let the Ministry of Information have periodical reports as to the line taken by these papers and to advise the Ministryat once of any failure to observe the standards required.8.   These proposals do not close all loopholes : (a) The few foreign papers which commenced publication before August 1940cannot be made subject to suppression by withdrawal of licences.(6) We may still be confronted from time to time by clandestine broadsheetsand other private publications of limited circulation produced on paper obtained from a printer&apos;s own ration.(c) There is a possibility that occasionally a British newspaper may makeitself the mouthpiece, directly or indirectly, of some controversy of a nature that would provoke suppression in&apos; a foreign language paper.(d) The. measures we may take in this country cannot prevent the publicationof even worse indiscretions overseas by, for instance, the Poles inthe United States of America or in Canada. To meet this last pointI suggest that we should inform the Governments of those countries ofthe measures that we are taking in case they feel disposed to follow a similar course.
9. The Foreign Secretary has asked me to include in this report two further points to which he would like attention to be drawn :---(1) There is a danger that foreign Governments may now hold His Majesty&apos;sGovernment more directly responsible for attacks made on them inthe foreign language Press on the ground that our measures of controlgive us the power to dictate the courses that should be pursued.(2) Seeing their own newspapers to some extent controlled, Allied Govern-ments may also prove even more sensitive than in the past to attacks upon them in uncontrolled papers such as the Daily Worker.10. Despite these drawbacks we agree in feeling that the courses which are recommended in this paper are the best ones to pursue in the circumstances.
