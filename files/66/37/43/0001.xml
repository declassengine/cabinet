(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)s e ore tW.P.(43)  245COPY NO.    cI5TH june, 1945WAR cabinet memorandum by the Minister of A^irpraft ProductionARMISTICES AND RELATEDOBLEMS1.     While I agree with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P.(43) 217) that we should not initiate anyinter-allied discussions of a theoretical character concern- &apos;ing the constitutional framework of international co-operationafter the war until we have reached some measure of agreementwith our major Allies on more immediate issuess I do notthink that the War Cabinet can - with safety - postponeindefinitely consideration of the issues raised in the paper7/.P. (43)31 &apos;The United Nations Plan&apos;,      It would.be unwise to take too short a view, of immediate practical issues.Surely they should be considered against the background of long-term policyl     Moreover, we may at any time during thenext twelve months be confronted with American or Russianproposals relating to long-term international political organisation and it is important that we should have clearedour own minds on the general principles and objectives ofBritish foreign policy before we become involved in inter-allied conversations on those matters.      I hope, therefore,that there will be an early opportunity of considering the revised version of W.P.(43) 31 which the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs has promised.2.      I am in general agreement with the principles which theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggests should govern our approach to &quot;Armistices and Related Problems&quot;subject to one important qualification.      I am not happyabout the suggestion that occupied territory should be divided into three main zones,, convenient for administrationby ourselves, United States, and U.S.3.R.      I recognise that from the point of view of military administration there ismuch to be said for an arrangement of this kind.      It appearsto&apos;me, however, that there are sound reasons for a &quot;mixed1form of United Nations administration throughout the occupied territories:-(i) There is great force in the American argument thatthe allotment of large areas to any one power could only result in the creation of zones of influence which would not be conducive to harmonybetween the Big Three and which might b&apos;ecome aserious embarrassment when at a later stage, a definitive settlement has to be reached.administered by men with such ^fg^nt^ ^administrative tradm a. aratlvslyAmericans, and ourselves.

slight differences between ourselves, the French,  andthe Belgians had very unfortunate consequences in thezoned administration of the occupied Rhineland in1919 and after.      This time the differences will bemuch greater.(iii) The success of the United Nations idea will depend uponthe development of habits of co-oxoeration in*practicalmatters serving mutually agreed purposes; and, even at the cost of some administrative &apos;efficiency&apos;,  it-is desirable that British, American, Russianofficials (and officials from the smaller allies)should learn to work side by side and acquire commonloyalties to the job in hand.      Only on the basis of *intimate collaboration of this kind will it bepossible to create a new tradition of disinterestedinternational administration.3.     I agree with the suggestion that a United nations commission for Europe should be set up for the purposes set outin 4(j) but I think that the functions of this Commission shouldbe defined more clearly.     Surely in each liberated Alliedterritory domestic Governments would come into existence.      Towhat extent,  if any, would these Governments be related to theUnited Nations authority so far as the administration of theirown territory was concerned?     Unless the relationship is -clearly understood and accepted there will be endlesspossibilities of friction.(Intld.)    R.S.C.Ministry of Aircraft Production, S.W.115TH JUNE,  1943.
