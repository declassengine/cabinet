THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.SECRET. Copy No, 123C.D.C. (43) 18.3Is  May, 1943.WAR CABINET.Civil Defence Committee.AIR RAID WARNING SYSTEM.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security and the Secretary of State for Air.THE arrangements made before the war for the issue of air raid warningsto the civil population and to industry included the appointment of Air raid warning Officers at Eighter Command Headquarters, to issue warnings for thewhole country on the information available there. It was considered by the AirMinistry that the Air Raid Warning officers should be appointed by, and beresponsible to, the Home Office, but it was eventually agreed that the Air ministry should appoint the Warning Officers and. be responsible for issuing warnings.The Home Office undertook responsibility for advising the Government on questions of policy in regard to air raid warnings. This system continued fora year and a half after the outbreak of war.2. In October, 1940, a Committee, under the chairmanship of Air Vice-Marshal R. H. Peck, examined the warning system and suggested two mainchanges : (a) Devolution of responsibility for issuing national warnings from a centralpoint at Fighter Command to the six Fighter Groups, and(6) Setting up a local alarm system operated, from Observer Corps Centresto assist essential industry to work on after the &apos;&apos; Alert&apos;&apos; until an&quot;Alarm&quot; of imminent danger^was received.3. The Committee also considered whether national warnings could be given from Observer Corps Centres instead of from Fighter Groups, but came to the-conclusion that the information available at Observer Centres was not then wide enough for this purpose.4. The War Cabinet, on the 14th October, 1940 (W.M. (40) 270,th conclusions), approved the recommendations in the Committee&apos;s report, (see.P. (40) 417), subject to further consideration being given to the questionwhether the officers appointed to operate the alarm scheme should be responsible to the Ministry of Home Security or to the Air Ministry.5. It was finally decided that the Ministry of Home Security should take all responsibility for the alarm scheme, and officers of that Ministry were appointed at most Observer Centres, where they use the information there avail-able to issue alarms.6. The position then created was that for the national warning scheme theMinistry of Home Security were responsible for policy, but actual warnings were issued by Fighter Command officers stationed at Fighter Group Headquarters,while for the alarm scheme the Ministry of Home Security were responsible both for policy and for the issue of alarms through their Alarm Controllers at royal observer Centres. In addition, the Alarm Staff of the Ministry of Home Securitynow issue national &quot; red &quot; warnings for hit and run raiders in coastal areas in daylight as a means of providing an earlier warning for raids which avoidradiolocation by flying low.[25505]
7. Thus it has come about that there are two separate warning systemsworking side by side, operated by separate agencies not in immediate contact with one another. Industry gets both types of warning, and in certain towns onthe south and east coast, where the local &quot; Alarm &quot;is sounded publicly, the whole population receives both. It frequently appears to those who hear both sets ofsignals that they are unsatisfactorily co-ordinated. Each type of warning showsup the short-comings of the other and invites criticism. It has frequentlyhappened in sudden raids that alarms have been given to factories before an alerthas been received by the public and on occasions bombs have been dropped after a factory alarm has been given and before a national alert has sounded. Thishas resulted in demands from factory workers that their wives and families shallhave the same warnings of enemy air activity as are received in the factories.When the normal sequence of &apos;&apos; Alert&apos;&apos; followed by &apos;&apos; Alarm &apos;&apos; is not followed, theconfidence of the public in the protection which warnings are intended to give them is shaken.8. Since the Peck Committee considered the possibility of issuing nationalwarnings from Observer Centres, the &quot;Yellow&quot; (preliminary) warning which required a very wide range of information has been abolished, and the royal observer Corps now have in hand the provision of tables at each Observer Centreon which will appear plots over land told from neighbouring centres and plotsover sea told from Group Filter Rooms. The additional communications toprovide for this are being made available.For example, at Bromley Observer Centre information will then be available of the movement of enemy aircraft in the whole of S.E. England bounded bya line from Orford Ness-Bicester-Isle of Wight, as well as at sea off the coasts.This information is wide enough to enable national warnings to be issued from.Bromley to the warning districts in the London area. All the other ObserverCentres will have similarly wide information.9. From a detailed examination which has been made of the range ofinformation which will be available at Observer Centres, when the Observer Corpsreorganisation is complete, it is clear that the national messages, &quot; purple,&quot;&quot; red &quot; and &quot; white &quot; can be issued from these centres to all the warning districts in the country at the ranges at which they are at present given.At. present national warnings are issued at Fighter Groups and the speedat which they can be issued depends mainly on two factors : (a) How quickly information of enemy aircraft can reach and be plotted atFighter Group, and(b) How quickly the warning messages can be distributed from FighterGroups to siren points and other recipients.As regards (a) above, the receipt of information at Observer Centres will be appreciably quicker than at Fighter Groups when the aircraft is over the areadirectly served by the Observer Centre, and a little quicker where the aircraft is over a neighbouring area. The receipt of information over the sea will be thesame in both cases.As regards (6) the distribution of warning messages from Observer Centres,passed on direct lines to the distributing exchanges of the warning districts, willbe appreciably quicker than in the case of messages passed, as at present, fromFighter Groups by trunk telephones, because of the elimination of the earlier stages of their passage.11. Further advantages of a devolution of national warnings to ObserverCentres are the avoidance of duplication and a saving in man-power.At present Fighter Command warning officers at Fighter Groups issuenational warnings&apos;, - and Ministry of Home Security Alarm Staff at ObserverCentres issue alarm messages to some 10,000 establishments in various partsof the country. Under the new system both national warnings and alarms to industry could be issued from Observer Centres by the existing Ministry of home security Alarm Staff, who, after 2  years&apos; experience of issuing warnings, are well qualified to do the work and are in fact issuing national warnings for hit and run raids in coastal areas. In this way the whole field of warnings wouldbe closely co-ordinated and many of the difficulties which in the past have arisenfrom dual control of warning messages would be removed by ensuring that altwarnings would be handled on the same information, by the same agency, fromthe same point.
12. There would also be a saving in man-power at Fighter Command andat Fighter Groups, where some 29 officers and 49 other ranks are engaged.Additional staff required by the Ministry of Home Security at Observer Centreswould be small and confined to a few special cases.The Air Ministry and Ministry of Home Security consider that if thetransfer of responsibility is agreed, one or two senior warning officers of fighter command should be seconded to the Ministry of Home Security to securecontinuity in the method of issuing national warnings.13. As regards communications, some direct lines of short or moderatelength will be required from Observer Centres to the distributing exchanges of warning districts, but, on the other hand, lines of much greater length fromFighter Groups to existing main distributing centres can be given up as well as &apos;the lines interconnecting the Fighter Groups which are provided for warningpurposes.   The General Post Office can provide the necessary communications.14. &quot;We, therefore, consider that national warnings in Great Britain shouldbe decentralised to Observer Centres and that the Ministry of Home Security,through their Alarm Controllers, should be responsible for their issue as for thealarm scheme. It is recognised that the efficiency of the warnings will depend to a large extent on the quality and speed of the information provided at ObserverCentres, and the Air Ministry accept the responsibility for maintaining the levelof quality and speed of this information as well as for making available thebenefits of any improvements which may be made in the future.15. No change is proposed in Fighter Commands responsibility for issuingwarnings in Northern Ireland, where there is no Observer Corps and the new arrangements are therefore not applicable.16.   We accordingly recommend that : (i) The issue of national air raid messages in Great Britain, which are atpresent   issued   from   Fighter   Group   Headquarters,   should   bedecentralised to Observer Centres.(ii) The responsibility for issuing national air raid messages be undertaken by the Ministry of Home Security through their Alarm Controllersat Observer Centres, who are at present responsible for issuing localalarms.(iii) The transfer of responsibility should be arranged between the two departments concerned as and when the new tables at ObserverCentres are brought into operation.H.
