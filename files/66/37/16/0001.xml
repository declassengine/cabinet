Successful attacks were made on Duisburg, Essen and Dortmund,but it has not been possible to obtain day photographic cover. Daylight attacks were made on railways and industrial targets- in&apos; occupied territory, those onIjmuiden achieving particular success. An exceptional mining effort was madeon the nights of the 27th/28th and the 28th/29th April.Night Operations.DuisburgEssenDortmundTarget.Day Operations.Julich  &quot;]Lingen  ^railway workshopsTours   JIjmuiden coke oven plant, blastfurnaces and steel worksThionville marshalling yards   ...ijmuiden power     station    and royal Dutch steel worksAmsterdam power stationHague power station and targetin Holland ... .......Abbeville marshalling vardsTubize (S.W. of Brussels)-way workshopsBoulogne marshalling yardsDate.26/27 April30&apos; April/I May4/5 May&apos;26 AprilAircraftDespatched.561305596i\2 May2-rail-o345722224-761261256In addition, 71 aircraft were despatched on anti-submarine patrol.Mining.On the nights of the 27th/28th April and 28th/29th April, 1,055 mines were laid in enemy waters. This compares with 1,055 laid in the whole of 1941.The cost in missing aircraft was 24 as compared with 26 in 1941.-   [25484] b
2On the first night 160 aircraft laid 459 mines in areas off the French Westcoast and the Frisian Islands.On the second night, 226 aircraft laid 596 mines in the Heligoland Bight, offHaugesund, in the Kattegat and Baltic approaches, and in the channels and offBaltic ports from Kiel to the Gulf of Danzig.In these operations a new type of mine was employed, mixed in every areawith mines in current employment. The task of sweeping presented to theGermans is, therefore, colossal, and covers waters from the Spanish frontier tothe Eastern Baltic. There is serious danger to U-boats entering and leavingFrench West Coast bases, and using the Baltic training areas, and interferencewith the activities of blockade runners and armed merchant raiders using theGironde. It has already been reported that the Swedish train ferry Malmo,plying between Malmo and Copenhagen, was mined near the Swedish Coast andbeached. It will probably be some time, however, before any clear picture of the damage achieved is available.Previous mining successes reported are as follows : On the 5th March, the Danish Ingrid (100 tons) was damaged by a mine inthe Great Belt.On the 6th March, the Danish cutter Jorma was mined and sunk 25 miles.S.W. of Graadyb Barre.On the 16th March, the Danish Norsdoem was mined and sunk 3 miles N.W.by W. of Graadyb Barre Buoy.On the 9th April, the Swedish A bisco was mined and sunk near Borkum.On the 28th April, two German salvage boats and a pontoon were mined and sunk in the Sound.On the 29th April, a steamship of unknown tonnage is reported to have been mined and sunk 4 miles S. of Spodsbjerg in the Langelands Belt. (This may bea result of the mining on the 28th/29th April.)Bombing Achievements.&quot;Recent Bomber Command operations have been notably successful againstthree critical factors in the enemy&apos;s war effort against Russia : (i) The supply of raw materials to the Ruhr. Intensive mining has very seriously dislocated and, in some cases, temporarily cut the supplyof foreign raw materials by water, notably iron ore. River transport in the Ruhr area itself has been attacked at Duisburg, its main port and the centre of the Ruhr coal industry.(ii) The output of munitions from the factories of the Ruhr.Attacks on Essen and Duisburg further dislocated productionand interrupted attempts to reorganise after the devastation pro-duced by previous attacks.(iii) The flow of tanks, guns and other armament to Russia.As a complement to the recent successful attack on the industryand port facilities of Stettin, sea communications throughout the west and South Baltic have been mined. This is a further blow to thesupply line to Finland, and the wdiole northern sector of the eastern front.There is no alternative to the Ruhr production and it cannot effectively betransferred elsewhere. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Germans continueto expand their night-fighter force in the West, which has now attained a first line strength of more than 500 aircraft.Duisburg (26th/27th April).Weather was good, though smoke interfered with visibility in the later stages. Night photographs confirmed crews&apos; reports that built-up areas to theE. and E.N.E. had suffered heavily. The Thyssen steel rolling mills at Mulheimsuffered very heavy damage, so few buildings being unaffected that work was completely stopped. Damage was also caused to the Duisburg municipal waterworks.Essen (30th April/Tst May).This was a blind bombing attack made through 10/10ths cloud, and a greatdegree of concentration was not expected. This technique is only used in areas where useful damage must result, even if the attack is spread. The Germancommunique reported considerable damage in Essen.
The total weight of bombs despatched to Essen now exceeds 10,000 tons.This is more than the quantity dropped on Greater London in the whole of the1940/41 attacks.Dortmund (4th/5th May).Weather conditions for this attack were favourable. 780 tons of H.E. and679 tons of incendiaries were dropped. The attack of the main force was concentrated within a period of 53 minutes. The plot of night photographsconfirms the crews&apos; reports that a good concentration was achieved. An unusuallylarge number of big explosions was reported, including two particularly largeones. The flak defences seem to have been saturated and to have died down asthe attack developed.In the plot of photographs, the largest concentration is seen in the closelybuilt-up area near the centre of the town. There is also a large concentrationabout two miles N.N.E. of the city centre. This covers an important group ofindustrial targets, namely, the works of Hoesch-Koln-Neuessen A.G. The steeiworks of this firm have an annual capacity of 1,500,000 tons and its finished products include shells and forgings for tanks. An important coal mine and asynthetic benzine plant as well as extensive marshalling yards are included in thearea.The German communique admitted considerable damage to buildings in thetown. There is every reason to suppose that this attack was extremely successful in putting the bulk of another important Ruhr town out of action for sometime, but no further details can be given until day photographic cover is obtained.Prints Nos. 1 and 2 show the plot of night photographs during the attack,and fires over the centre of the town.Ijmuiden (2nd and 3rd May).Day photographic cover shows that these attacks by 24 arid 6 aircraft respectively were extremely accurate and successful. In the works of theM.E.K.O.G. (which, in pre-war days, supplied gas to the Royal Dutch steelworks) the coke-oven plant has been severely damaged at one end, a building(covering an area of 2,500 square yards) engaged on ammonium sulphate produc-tion and ammonia distillation, has been almost completely destroyed, the compressorhouse has been severely damaged, and the roof of the ammonium sulphate silohas been destroyed over an area of at least 150 feet x 100 feet.In addition, a workshop (160 feet x 40 feet) of the Velsen Generating Stationhas been almost completely destroyed, while a direct hit has severed the railway line serving the steel works.Results of Previous Raids.Berlin.Photographic evidence of the success of the raid of the 1st/2nd March hasnow been considerably amplified by reports from intelligence sources. There is evidence from several sources that the damage was severe and, in particular, thatthe heavy concentration of bombs on the administrative centre, which is believed to have included considerable destruction at the Air Ministry, made a greatimpression on public morale.A remarkable number of high priority targets were hit and notably good results were obtained on railway workshops, radio and telephone equipment and theproduction of precision and optical instruments. The engineering industryalso suffered considerably. An area of 22 acres of the railway repair shops atTempelhof was gutted. The effect of this was not only to destroy about 30 loco-motives, actually under repair, at the time of the attack, but also to eliminateurgently needed repair facilities for three or four months. During this period the works would normally handle some 150 locomotives.At the same time the Schoeneberg Depot, which, houses most of the Berlinunderground locomotives and rolling-stock and is always full at night, was-severely hit. The elevated railway is said by intelligence sources to have had several direct hits, and the result must have been a major interference with theinternal railway traffic of Berlin over a considerable period.Six undertakings in Berlin engaged on M / T repairs were put out of action for at least two months. This is important, as the German High Command isknown to be greatly exercised by the shortage of M/T repair facilities and thishas grown more acute as a result of heavy losses sustained in Russia.

This is important, as the German High Command isknown to be greatly exercised by the shortage of M/T repair facilities and thishas grown more acute as a result of heavy losses sustained in Russia.   It is[25484] b 2
unlikely that the work of these undertakings could be transferred elsewhere, andthe result is therefore equivalent to the loss to Germany of the vehicles they wouldhave turned out during that period.The damage done to the Telefunken works at Zehlendorf has specialsignificance because of the destruction which has been caused in the complemen-tary Siiddeutsche Apparatfabrik at Nuremberg. Telefunken, which had alreadybeen hit in January, were pioneers in R.D.F. development, and one of the blocksdestroyed contained their research establishments. It is further reported thatthe important Telefunken works at Tempelhof suffered heavy damage, but no details are available.Three other Berlin factories engaged on radio and telephone production werebadly damaged. Taken in conjunction with our successful attacks on the Phillipsworks at Eindhoven, this damage may well have serious effects on the Germanoutput of radio apparatus.Severe damage was done to important departments of Askania Werke (whoare believed to produce most of the aviation instruments in use by the G.A.F.)at Steglitz and Mariendorf. The Mariendorf branch of Siemens was also badlyhit, In view of the great sensitivity to bomb blast of precision instruments (suchas altimeters, flak predictors and range-finders, which are made at these works),the loss incurred is thought to have been heavy.Mannheim.The damage done to the I.G. Farben works (the most important chemicalproducers in Germany) by the attack on the 16th/17th April, includes threebuildings destroyed and 18 others damaged, six of them seriously. 5^ acres inthe works, of Jospeh Vogele A.G. (tanks, M.V. and tractor components) aredevastated. Over 700 residential and commercial buildings were destroyed and damaged. The dock area was badly hit, and quantities of material destroyedboth in the warehouses and in the yards and quays.As a result of damage to railway yards in this attack, all through traffic,including-coal to Italy, via that all-rail route had to be diverted via Schwetzingen,and dislocation was felt as far as Freiburg.Duisburg.Among the factories damaged in the attacks on the 8th/9th and the 9th/10th April were the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. (important munitions producers),where three separate branches of the works had workshops and buildings hit.Another factory producing electrical apparatus was also badly damaged:The Goods Station was partially destroyed and a workshop at the locomotiverepair shops has suffered.Stuttgart.Ground sources report that the damage caused in the attack of the 14th/15th April included a factory producing ball-bearings, where  300,000 of damage was done. This is presumably V.K.F. Norma in Bad Cannstadt, whichphotographs show to have sustained several hits. In all, 40 industrial and commercial undertakings were hit, the generator at the power station was gutted,and over 400 houses are seen to have been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable.Damage to the main station and to railway facilities in the neighbourhoodcaused severe dislocation in traffic working. Three important trunk lines were still not open to traffic on the 17th April. Eight locomotives were put out of action and the signalling system, which is power-worked and, in consequence, veryvulnerable to air attack, was again badly damaged. In addition, many of thelines in the Stuttgart area are electrified, current being obtained from overheadwires, and damage to these added considerably to the general dislocation.Stettin.Photographic cover shows that about 100 acres of closely-grouped industrial buildings in the South of the town have been completely devastated in the attackon the 20th/21st April. The principal undertakings which have been wreckedare a large chemical works (Chemischer Producten-Fabriken Pommerensdirf-Milch) and two factories producing edible oils.Three shipyards and the Naval Base (BredOwer Werde) have all been damaged, and military and police barracks have suffered badly.,Residential property destroyed or rendered uninhabitable is estimated at,700 flats and at least 320 houses.
Reports in the local press show that on the 22nd April the gas and water supplies were out of action. An intelligence source reports that the fire-fightingorganisation was entirely inadequate to cope with the number of fires which broke out and was compelled to concentrate on saving public utilities and the docks and harbour area. An appeal to Berlin was refused. This was directly due to thediversionary attack on Berlin by Mosquitoes, which successfully deceived theauthorities there into expecting a major attack.Rostock.Photographs Nos. 3 and 4 show the Heinkel works photographed during the night attack on the 20th/21st April and the old town photographed on the3rd May, 1943.German Morale.Study of the effects of continued air attack on German morale during Aprilleads to the following general conclusions : (i) Progressive deterioration of German morale as a result of air attackhas continued. In the Ruhr this has assumed grave proportions, whileelsewhere the general sense of insecurity noted during March has been maintained. There is insufficient evidence to judge the degree ofdemoralisation effected in South-Western Germany, though it isbelieved to be considerable,(ii) The problems of rehousing and evacuating the civilian population inbombed areas have become more acute, and the latter has tended to spread the disruptive influence of attacks over a wider area than hitherto.(iii) In Essen the organisation of relief has functioned less efficiently than during the preceding period, but there is as yet no direct evidence ofrioting or agitation.(iv) The tendency to attribute to Hitler and the Party the ultimate responsi-bility for air attacks has become more pronounced,(v) The German authorities have manifested greater alarm at the direct and indirect effects of air attack on the war effort than in any previousperiod.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, May 24, 1943.
