(42) 163rd Conclu-sions). Since December, strategical and tactical developments have taken placewhich have involved further demands upon naval man-power. Some of these commitments have been met at the expense of our present allocation of man-power; others remain to be met during the course of the year. The resultingdemands have been the subject of close investigation by a sub-committee of theBoard of Admiralty, and for the last six months all services making demands upon Naval man-power have been scrutinised by a senior Flag Officer actingindependently of the Naval Staff. This process is continuing as demands arise.The additional requirements which are now put forward are the lowest theBoard Of Admiralty feel able to accept, having regard to the need to maintainthe efficiency of the Fleet.The requirements may be divided into : (a) Purely Naval commitments;(b) Demands arising from the manning of Merchant Navy defences:(c) The needs of Combined Operations; and(d) Demands on the W.R.N.S.(a) Our strategy in the Mediterranean has put a heavy burden upon theNavy. Few of the naval personnel drafted for operation &quot; Torch&quot; have been returned, most of them having been absorbed into the naval organisation in north africa. These must be replaced. In addition, I am faced with a further demandfor 3,000 men in connection with further operations. Port parties, communica-tions ratings and maintenance ratings must all be provided, and demands tendto increase daily. Coastal Forces staffs must also be provided for the north african ports already in our hands. Tactical developments also play their partin increasing the demand for man-power. The policy of fitting more Bofors guns in certain sloops, corvettes and destroyers, and more Oerlikons in battleships,aircraft-carriers and other ships, means finding crews for these guns. Seamen,R.D.F. and radio mechanics must be found to control the system of FighterDirection in ships, which is gradually coming into operation. The complementsrequired for the Kaiser class escort carriers which we expect to obtain from america have proved larger than was expected. These expansions carry withthem the further requirement for increased numbers of commission and warrantcandidates and for staffs to man the additional training establishments.   The[25488]
total figure for purely naval commitments, the greater part of which is accountedfor under the foregoing heads, amounts to 23,000, and I would point out thatthis figure has only been achieved by increasing the number of men with morethan one action station, on the assumption that the whole armament of a ship willnot often be in action at the same time.(b) In addition to these purely naval requirements, the increasing tempo ofthe war against the U-boat and the execution of our counter-measures have involved further calls upon naval personnel. New weapons and devices are beingfitted in merchant ships and must be manned by naval personnel, e.g., smokeapparatus, R.D.F. and Asdics. Bases for fitting merchant ships with net defence equipment are also to be manned by naval personnel. After the severest scrutiny,I consider that the minimum requirement on this account is 2,000.(c) The heaviest demand is for landing-craft crews, maintenance personnel and other needs of Combined Operations. I consider that the time has now arrived when these demands should be treated entirely separately from thedemands for the Navy and the Merchant Navy. As our offensive strategy developsthese demands grow, and no amount of pinching and saving at the expense of theNavy can supply even a small proportion of the present requirements. At theend of 1942 the figures agreed were worked out on the understanding that no more men would be required from the Navy after the 31st May, 1943. The maximumadditional numbers now asked for in 1943 to be available by February 1944 amountto some 60,000. Even if these were made available for recruiting, the navy would have the greatest difficulty in finding suitable officers or instructors to give them their ab initio training, and it would probably be necessary to pay off ships or to dilute the Fleet to an unacceptable extent for this purpose. There is thefurther difficulty of finding a large number of extra training establishments forthese personnel. I therefore consider that these numbers can only be achievedand trained in time if the Army undertakes to provide men who have done theirrecruits training and C.C.O. trains them in landing-craft duties. The navy would stjill have to provide 5,000 special ratings, such as motor mechanics, boat-wrigKts&quot;, &amp;c. The maximum number required from the Army would amount to51,000 (including officers) while the Navy would have to provide 4,000 W.R.N.S.in addition to those already supplied. In urging that this new commitment shouldbe undertaken by the Army, I wish to point out that of these 51,000 officers andmen the vast majority are required for landing craft. They will be usefullyemployed in landing troops, &amp;c, for perhaps two or three weeks in any singleyear; for the remainder of the year they will be surplus to Naval requirements and wasted to the nation. On the other hand, if they are provided from Militarysources they will be available to the Army for the whole year, and when the landing craft are not in use or are no longer required, these officers and men can be usedfor defensive purposes at home or trained for offensive employment overseas.Whatever uniform they wear, they will come from the same source-civilian life,and, as now, they will receive their only seamanlike training from the combined operations&apos; Organisation. I must emphasise that this new commitment forCombined Operations cannot be met by reductions in the Navy (proper) withoutthe very gravest risks.(d) I am also faced with an additional demand for 10,000 women to meetunforeseen commitments of the W.R.N.S. This includes 4,000 for combined operations expansion.2. To sum up, I have to put before my colleagues additional Naval require-ments of man-power as follows : Royal Navy     .................. 23,000Merchant Navy          ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 2.000Combined Operations (on the assumption that theNavy is not required to meet CCOs.&apos; generalrequirements after the 31st May, 1943) &quot;      ... 5,000W.R.N.S.Admiralty, S.W.1, 23rd May, 1943.30,00010,000A.
