The crew were stated to be returning to Lubeck.Operational Achievements.Dortmund (23rd/24th May).Weather conditions were favourable for the attack and 2,260 tons of bombs were dropped on the city. Day cover shows that this raid was an outstandingsuccess, although detailed assessment of the widespread damage has not yet beencompleted. The two largest steel works in the Dortmund area, Hoesch A.G. Steel-works and Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG. (Dortmunder Union Steelworks), whichhad both suffered considerably in the first attack on the 4th/5th May, have again been damaged. 9 other unidentified factories concerned with engineering and theproduction of machine tools have also been hit. Destruction of housing, public buildings and public utilities is so comprehensive that production of all kinds islikely&quot; to be virtually at a standstill for a considerable period. Prints 1-3 showsome of the damage caused.dusseldorf (25th/26th May).It is probable that considerable damage was caused in this attack, especiallyin the S.W. part of the city, but no day photographic cover has yet been obtained.Numerous fires occurred and several factories engaged on war production were hit. The German communique reported that bombs also fell on the Wuppertalcities of Barmen and Elberfeld to the east of dusseldorf.Essen (27th/28th May).518 aircraft attacked Essen and dropped 1,428 tons of bombs on the city.The German communique admitted severe damage and partial day cover showssubstantial additions to the destruction caused by earlier attacks. It is not easynow to discriminate between new and previous havoc in Essen, but Krupps was again hit in several places.
Barmen (29th/30th May).The Wuppertal cities of Barmen and Elberfeld, though not containing verylarge-scale undertakings like Krupps and Thyssen, are of great importance in theproduction of smaller components and consumer goods. They had not previously been attacked and therefore constituted one of the few sources from which relief for the Ruhr and Rhineland might still be forthcoming. On the 29th/30th May.719 aircraft were despatched to attack Barmen. Crews&apos; reports indicated thathighly successful results were obtained and the first night photographs receivedconfirm this.Jena (27th May).Fourteen Mosquitoes were despatched for a dusk attack on the Carl Zeiss andSchott optical works at -Jena. A balloon barrage and intense light flak preventedsome of the aircraft attacking the primary target and these bombed alternativetargets in the neighbourhood, but three aircraft claimed hits on the glass grindingand polishing shops at Zeiss, and at the Schott works bombs were seen to straddlethe main shop.Results of Previous Raids,Moehne and Eder Dams.A study of the photographs from the point of view of damage to railwayshas been made. The damage is severe and will necessitate much heavy reconstruc-tion work. The largest single item is the Fferdecke Viaduct. Traffic dislocation,especially in the Ruhr, must be considerable and serious congestion may well occuron the alternative routes through Dusseldorf and Duisburg. The Wuppertal area is particularly affected, since most of its direct connections northwards to theMulheim-Essen-Bochum-Dortmund area have been severed. The cutting of theSchwerte-Frondenburg line means the temporary abandonment of that route as one of the three main eastern rail exists from the Ruhr. The remaining twoeastern exits (via Ffamm and Soest) will now have to bear the whole weight ofthis traffic. It is reported that the Todt organisation are taking away 1,000 oftheir men from Le Havre and Dieppe for repair work on the dams.The National-Zeitung of the 18th May states that in Essen water must beboiled before it is used. (This contamination of water supply must certainly have occurred in many other places also.)Dortmund.A final interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the4th /5th May shows that the greatest concentration of damage, mainly caused by fire, is in the centre of the old town, in the urban districts immediately to thenorth, and in the dock area to the north-west. In the 45 acres of industrialdevastation 28 factories are involved. In the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. thepower-house, 2 rolling mills and a machine shop have all been hit, and at HoeschA.G. a rolling mill and a large workshop have been partially destroyed, and threesheds and a shop completely wrecked. Other factories destroyed or damagedinclude electrical firms, engineers, millers, 3 railway works and 4 breweries.Pithead buildings of 2 collieries have also been hit. A great many warehouseshave been destroyed both on the quaysides of the inland docks and adjoining therailway on the east side of the town.In the main passenger station there is severe damage to the main entranceand booking office and to two goods sheds. At Dortmund Enscheder Bahnhofthere are 2-^ acres of severe damage to railway workshops, and there are manydirect hits on railway tracks, roadways and canal embankments. The maintelegraph offices, the Deusen gasworks, the Dortmund airfield and the Rathaushave all been damaged, and it is estimated that over 1,600 houses and buildings in the town and its immediate surroundings have been destroyed or damaged.Bochum.In addition to damage already reported, a final interpretation of photographsshows that 16 industrial concerns have been affected, including 3 branches ofVereinigte Stahlwerke, 5 engineering works and 4 collieries. A main-line railway bridge has collapsed as the result of at least one direct hit. Public buildingsdamaged include the town administrative buildings, the agricultural school,andthe central prison. Altogether, some 400 business and residential buildings havebeen destroyed and about 280 damaged.[25584] b 2
Duisburg.As a result of the attacks on the 26th /27th April and the 12th/13th Maymany of the important industrial concerns in the suburbs of Duisburg have suffered damage. Four factories of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. (AugustThyssen) have been affected, two of them very severely, and a coke and benzolpurifying plant has apparently been put out of action. Extensive damage is seenalso to a tar distillation plant, the largest in Germany. Other firms damagedinclude chemical works, zinc and sulphuric acid plant, ships&apos; boiler works, wireworks, cotton and cellulose weaving mills, silk fabric factory, soap works, maltworks and two collieries.Many warehouses and store sheds on the quaysides have been destroyed and stores of timber burnt out. Many barges have been sunk, others damaged, and alarge building yard destroyed by fire. Railway tracks in the marshalling yards and sidings have been disrupted by direct hits and rolling-stock scattered.Communications have been further interrupted by direct hits on branch lines, bysevere damage to a lock-gate on the Rhein-Fferne Canal, by damage to two railwayviaducts and especially by severe damage to the main passenger and goods station.The most severe damage to residential property, apart from the old town andPapendell, is found in the districts of Meiderich and Hamborn, areas N.E. of the docks, and in the district of Neudorf, S.E. of the town centre. In the former some850 buildings, and in the latter district some 300, have suffered demolition orsevere damage the.&apos;greater part, of them being of the workers&apos; dwelling type.Altogether, over 2.000 houses or other buildings are seen to have been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable by fire or H.E.Pilsen.It is now known that in the attack on the 16th/17th April 200 Germansoldiers in a barracks at Dobrany were killed. In Nyrany a power station, whichwas a source of supply to the Skoda Works, was hit and is expected to be out ofaction for a-period of 2 or 3 months. A lignite mine was damaged.General.The following extract from the Vblkischer Beobachter gives some indication of the state to which the Ruhr is being reduced.&quot; The Ruhr has now become the front. It is usual to call this districtGermany&apos;s heart and this heart is what the enemy wants to hit when heattacks the population .... Three years ago, the British were raiding the ruhr nightly, dropping bombs at random. Now, not only single houses aredestroyed but entire districts are burnt down. Streets or business houses are roped off because on both sides only smoke-blackened fronts of buildingson the point of collapse remain. Squares are surrounded by faceless ruins;there are entire districts where one meets hardly a living soul because thehouses are hollow, split, or completely gutted.&quot; A current saying is, &apos; What is a coward? &apos; &apos; Anyone from the Ruhrwho volunteers to go to the front.&apos; &quot;A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, 17th June, 1943.
