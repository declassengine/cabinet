E.Foreign Office, 12th June, 1943.INFORMATION recently received from a source in Stockholm, which has proved reliable in the past, makes it possible to piece together the story of hungary&apos;s recent relations with Italy and Germany and to fill in the background of Premier Kallay&apos;s adjournment of the Hungarian Parliament a month ago..Some of this information has already been confirmed from other sources.2. Before Kallay&apos;s visit to Mussolini early in April the Germans had hopedthat it might be possible to make use of the occasion to bring further pressure-to bear upon Hungary to mobilise her economic resources and man-power more fully in the interests of the German war effort. It was suggested to Mussolinithat he should speak to Kallay accordingly.3. Mussolini appears, in fact, to have asked Hungary for troops, but he made it clear that in his view they should be used not on the Eastern Front butin the Balkans in order to enable Italian divisions to be withdrawn to Italy.Kallay resisted this proposal. Nevertheless the conversations appear to have proceeded&apos; in an atmosphere of great cordiality, and Mussolini is said to haveexpressed complete understanding of Kallay&apos;s aim to maintain Hungary&apos;resources in being inside the country against possible future developments.Mussolini is also said to have confided in Kallay that he himself would have certain demands to make of the Germans.4. At Mussolini&apos;s meeting with Hitler shortly afterwards the former isstated to have made the following proposals for avoiding an Axis catastrophe : (i) Axis strategy should concentrate on the defensive;(ii) More lenient methods should be adopted in the occupied territories, therights of the small nations should be proclaimed and Poland grantedless drastic treatment and a measure of independence;(iii) A conciliatory attitude should be adopted towards religion and the churches.12054 &apos; [25565]
Hitler rejected all these demands peremptorily. He made, however,concessions on paper as regards the rights of small nations, and he agreed tocertain of Mussolini&apos;s demands for military assistance, especially anti-aircraft equipment.i    5.   When Admiral Horthy subsequently visited Hitler at BerehtesgadenHitler, in his turn, presented a written list of formal complaints and demands :-(i) The Hungarian army had fought badly on the Eastern Front and hadvirtually sabotaged the efforts of the German army. To make amendsfurther Hungarian troops should be placed immediately at Germany&apos;disposal. It was claimed that the Hungarian Chief of Staff,General Szombathelyi, had committed himself, during his visit to berlin a month before, to the despatch of Hungarian troops to the balkans in return for the cession of the Banat to Hungary.(ii) Hungary&apos;s standard of living was too high.   Her economic life must be organised on a total1 war basis as regards both production anddeliveries to Germany.(iii) Jews in Hungary were still allowed a dangerous degree of freedom, andthe military training, of Jews was an insult to the nations of Europe.Measures must be taken for the total solution of the Jewish problem.(iv) The indulgent treatment of the left wing movement was playing intothe enemy&apos;s hands. The left wing movement must accordingly be liquidated and, in particular, the Social Democrat organisationsdissolved.(v) Germany possessed irrefutable proof that the Hungarian Governmenthad been in contact with the British and the Americans. Suchcontacts must stop, and Ullein-Reviczky, the head of the PressDepartment, who is known to have been behind some of the recentapproaches to us, must be dismissed. Kallay himself must also go. and a Prime Minister be appointed who was prepared to throwHungary&apos;s entire weight into total warfare.6. Horthy was incensed at these demands and particularly insulted by thedisparaging references to the conduct of the Hungarian troops on the eastern front.  He refused the demands in toto and returned to Budapest.7. Shortly after his return the remnants of the Hungarian divisions fromthe Eastern Front were welcomed back to Budapest with considerable ceremony.The Germans also at once began to turn on the heat through the Imredy party.Even while Horthy was still at Berchtesgaden there had been indications thatthe Imredy group were preparing a Parliamentary coup, and Kallay had orderedreliable troops to Budapest. Direct action was prevented, but pressure continued.From the little information available the. demands made by Imredy and rightwing opposition seem to have followed remarkably closely the line of Hitler&apos;demands to Horthy. On the 30th April M. Jaross, the Vice-President of theImredy party, moved in Parliament that a debate should be held on domestic policy, and particularly on the activities of the Social Democrat party and &quot; thewhispering campaign conducted by the Jewish minority.&quot; His colleague,M. Rajliss, also accused the Government of being pro-Jewish and of pursuing a &quot;leftist &quot;. policy. The motion for the debate was narrowly defeated and only because the parties of the Left, including the Social Democrats, voted for theGovernment. For the next session two members of the Imredy party put downquestions directed against a particular Minister. The Government felt that these would raise such difficulties that they decided to adjourn Parliament. The lower house was prorogued on the 4th May and the Upper House on the 7th May.Adjournment in the middle of a regular session is permitted under the HungarianConstitution but unparallelled in recent Hungarian history. The Budapestradio, on the 4th May, reported Kallay as having explained that it was theunshakable decision of the Government to maintain the initiative with regardto the problems connected with foreign policy and the prosecution of the war.8. There seems little doubt that the adjournment of Parliament was primarily a defensive move against pressure from the Right organised by theGermans. Although two important committees of the House will remain in being and although, so far as we know, the parties of the Left have not been disbanded,it seems inevitable that the latter&apos;s activities will in future have to be carried on-less openly. The fact that for tactical reasons they have given Kallay a measureof support should probably not be taken as meaning that they have abandoned all
opposition to his policy, or that they intend to give &quot;up their pressure for a more liberal social policy at home and a less subservient attitude towards Germany inforeign affairs.9. Against the above background the full significance of several passages ina speech made by Kallay on the 29th ]\lay is more readily seen.10. As regards foreign affairs, Kallay emphasised that his supreme aim was-to safeguard Hungarian national life and the existence of the HungarianState. Hungary wished to live within her o Wii bo j &apos;d G X&apos; s as an independent nationaccording to her own traditions and with her own institutions. He went out ofhis way to defend the rights of small nations and declared that Hungary couldonly bear sacrifices in proportion to her strength. Although there was the usualformal reference to the defence of Europe against the Bolshevik onslaught, no direct mention appears to have been made of Germany&apos;s role. Kallay was at pains to defend Hungary&apos;s recent annexations of territory, which he described as the^restoration of her thousand-year-old possessions.11. As regards the provision of Hungarian troops, Kallay explained thatthe decision to participate in the Russian campaign was taken before his termof office. Hungarian troops had always been the last to leave the field of battle(there has been very strong feeling in the Hungarian army over the way in whichthe Germans abandoned them on the Eastern Front to fight rearguard actions withinadequate equipment).12. On the subject of domestic policy, Kallay stated that despite the adjournment of Parliament he would continue to consider the Parliamentarysystem as the basis of national life. He promised that the competent ministers would shortly inform the country of their proposed social and financial measuresto balance and improve living conditions. He stressed that the whole nation wasunited as never before behind Admiral Horthy. Only on the subject of the Jewsdoes Kallay appear to have made any concessions to German demands, although these were mainly verbal (he is reported himself to be deeply in debt to Jews).He stated that the final solution could only be the deportation of the Jews. this could, however, not be done as long as .no place had yet been found in which toresettle them. Hungary would undertake nothing which conflicted with herChristian civilisation, and would maintain the humanitarian outlook which she had always displayed in questions of race and religion.13. The whole speech is a good example of the equivocal policy which Kallayhas striven consistently to maintain : the maximum resistance to German andItalian demands consistent with the maintenance of correct relations and the safeguarding of his own position inside Hungary, accompanied by friendlygestures towards the Americans and ourselves and to a lesser extent towards the finns and the Turks the whole governed by the one aim of preserving, againstthe inevitable day of reckoning, as much as possible of Hungary&apos;s existingeconomic resources, social structure, political system and territorial gains.D.
