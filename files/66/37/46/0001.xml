THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet. &apos; June 1943SECRET. Copy No 3W.P. (43) 246.*.17th June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Minister of State.EVERY informed observer, official and unofficial, British and Allied, whohas been in contact with Palestine affairs during the last twelve months is nowconvinced of one thing, namely, that the country is heading for the most seriousoutbreak of disorder and violence which it has yet seen, and that the explosionis timed to go off as soon as the War ends in Europe, or possibly a few monthsearlier. Opinions differ as to the form the outbreak will take, whether civildisobedience, revolt, civil war or an attempted coup d&apos;Etat, and as to how andby which side the actual shooting may be started. But of the certainty, of theoutbreak, unless it can be averted by some action of the British Government, thereis no doubt.2. I do not intend to go into the historical rights and wrongs of the&apos;&apos; Palestine problem &apos;&apos;; they have been most fully dealt with in a series ofState papers, which reached its peak in the brilliant analysis by the 1937 RoyalCommission. I am concerned solely with the facts of the situation which faces usto-day, the most important of which is the change which has come over politicalZionism in recent years. In brief, Zionism has embarked upon an expansionistprogramme, which it is, it appears, prepared, if necessary, to try and carry through by force.3. It may be convenient to deal first with the force available to the leadersof Zionism in Palestine if they wished to use it to carry out their policy. Over40,000 Jews are enlisted in the British Army and various Police formations&apos; inPalestine, where they have received training in the use of modern weapons. Ata time of crisis in the political future of Zionism, the loyalty of these men tothe nominal Government of the country could not be relied on. The maininstrument which the extremist leaders have at their disposal is, however, theHagana, the illegal quasi-military organisation, which has been in existencefor many years. Its strength is now believed to be about 80,000 men, organised in a territorial defence force and a striking force of more highly trained and equipped regiments, to whom commando units have recently been added. TheJewish Agency has recently been spending about 15 per cent, of its annual budget of over  1 million on a service described as &quot;internal security,&quot; which is, infact, the organisation, training and equipment of the Hagana. modern equipment, including machine guns and possibly mortars, has been acquired insubstantial quantities; the existence of caches of arms in Jewish settlements inPalestine is openly admitted by official Jewish leaders, though they have consistently refused to disclose their whereabouts, and resistance has been offered to attempts by the military authorities to seize such arms as have been located.There is reason to believe that the bulk of the arms are controlled and distributedunder the central direction of the Jewish Agency.    A similar, though much* Circulated originally ns ii Middle Eastern War Council paper (M.E.W.C. (48)-2).[25550]    - b
smaller, para-military organisation, known as the Irgun Tzvai Leumi, ismaintained by the Revisionist Party; it has lately been reported that a jointcommand for this organisation and the Hagana has been set up against the coming&quot; trouble.&quot; It is clear enough that these preparations go far beyond the scale ofprotection which scattered Jewish settlements might need against bandit raidsin a time of disturbance.4. The purpose of these elaborate preparations and the use to which theymight be put in given circumstances by the present Zionist leaders can only beinferred from a study of the recent trends in Zionist policy. Zionism began asa humanitarian and liberal movement. It was linked from the start, however,with racial and narrow national concepts, which are now in danger of leading it into the familiar course taken by many similar liberal-national revivals inEurope. The official organs of the movement are now pledged openly to the&quot; Biltmore programme,&quot; which demands the immediate creation of a JewishCommonwealth &quot; in Palestine. Not many years ago Mr. Ben Gurion (Chairmanof the Jewish Agency Executive in Palestine), describing the Jewish rejection of the British Governments White Paper, said that the Jews &quot; obeyed a higherlaw,&quot; which must over-ride &quot; the law of Britain &quot; if the two came into conflict.More recently (July 1942), Mr. Golomb, a member of the Histadruth Executive,spoke as follows to a closed Zionist Meeting : &quot; We have managed to acquire a legal, armed Jewish force within thePalestine Police.....But our duty is not thereby completed.   This legalarmy must be supported by the Homeland, that is by the entire Yishuv. our principal duty is, in case of emergency, immediately to strengthen this legalarmy with an illegal one.   We all know that the Zionist problem will haveto be solved one day by force of arms.....    It can never- be solved by political arguments; only by a fight. We must prepare ourselves, bothspiritually and materially, for this decisive struggle.&quot;The &quot; spiritual &quot; side of the preparation has meant that, in the past threeyears, the Jewish community in Palestine has been more and more regimented ontotalitarian lines, and any Jew who openly opposes the &apos;&apos; party line&apos;&apos; is now in personal danger. The object of this united front was avowed by Mr. Ben Gurionhimself, speaking in February 1943 :&apos;&apos; After the announcement of the Biltmore programme I was informedthat its implementation would cause disturbances in Palestine. I repliedthen,   and  I   repeat  to-day,   that   I  am  certain   that   there   will  bedisturbances.....   The weeks and months following the collapse of theHitler regime will be a time of uncertainty in Europe and even more soin Palestine, and we must exploit this period in order to confront Britainand America with a fait accompli.&quot; &apos;5. There can, I think, be no mistaking the tone of these and many similarstatements which could be quoted, read in conjunction with the military preparations described above. There are many admirable qualities about theJewish National Home, both in the conception and in the way it has been carriedout. But under the present leadership of the small group of very practicalfanatics who dominate the Jewish Agency, the Histadruth and the other Jewishnational organisations, it seems clear enough that Zionism is set on anuncompromising course which, if not checked, is bound to lead to conflict withthe peaceful development and security of the Middle East as a whole.6. It will no doubt be agreed that, whatever the rights and wrongs of thematter, an open revival of the Jew v. Arab conflict in Palestine would very seriously damage the political basis of our influence in other parts of the middle east. The real sympathy of the Iraqi or Egyptian governing classes with thePalestine Arabs can perhaps be exaggerated. But the Zionist issue in palestine is at least a useful pawn in the game to the Governments of these countries. by providing a stimulus of fear to transform pan-Arab feeling into anti-british feeling, and at the same time occupying British attention in a military sense,it offers to those nationalist quarters who desire it a useful means of puttingpressure on His Majesty&apos;s Government to obtain concessions towards freeingEgypt and Iraq more completely from all British influence.7. In so far as we can gain the good-will of the so-called Arab States (aswe have that of Ibn Saud) by fair dealing in their own domestic problems, this aspect of the Palestine danger might to some extent be neutralised.   But the
time is passing for that remedy to be effective, even if it ever could have been to any great extent. The reason for the change is the aggressive behaviour of the zionists in Palestine themselves. Where there was formerly no more thansympathy sentimental and perhaps largely artificial-for the Palestine Arabs,it is now possible to observe the growth, particularly among the younger educatedclasses in Syria and. Iraq, of a real fear of Zionist infiltration and dominationin their own countries. This, of course, is seen as a direct challenge to the hopes of national progress which the Arab.countries entertain for themselves. Educatedyounger Arabs of Damascus, Aleppo or Baghdad, would not be content Ibr their countries to become a race of contented peasantry and, leave industry, commerce and the apparatus of western civilisation to the Jews, however able and well-intentioned the latter might be. Precisely.because they are alert to the advantages of Western civilisation, they wish to do these things for themselves. the compromise which Dr. Weizmann and, others have sometimes pictured, involving the peaceful penetration of a Middle Eastern &quot; Lebensraum&quot; by a highly-^industrialised Jewish community based in Palestine, is no longer practicalpolities, if it ever was. Fear that the British and American Governments maypermit, or even encourage, these Jewish expansionist aims after the Warconstitutes the one serious challenge to the moral and political leadership of theUnited Nations in this part of the world.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot be expected to take long-rangedecisions regarding the future of Palestine while the War is still in progress.Nevertheless, the development of the situation in Palestine, as I have attempted to describe it above, makes it urgently necessary to examine what are the alterna-tives before us between now and the critical period, at the end of the war, and what their respective consequences would be.9. The first alternative is to do nothing and say nothing, and hope for thebest when the time comes, with the aid of such force as we can muster to preserveinternal security. If we pursue this course, I think it would be deluding ourselves to suppose that an attempt will not be made, in some form or other, to bringabout Mr. Ben Gurion&apos;s fail accompli. The extreme Zionist leaders are placinggreat hopes on the effects of the vigorous propaganda campaign they are atpresent conducting in the United States and Great Britain, particularly theformer. They hope by this means to produce conditions in which the Britishand American Governments would, acquiesce in a Zionist fait accompli, either byactually converting influential political circles to their own exclusive presentation of the Palestine case, or at least by so dividing and confusing public opinion(as Goebbels did during the years of Germany&apos;s &quot;peaceful expansion&quot;), thatthe Governments would be unable to act. In this way the adherents of theBiltmore programme would hope to be able to take the decision into their own hands without fear of interruption. There is a considerable, though silent, mass of moderate Jews in Palestine who distrust and fear the present &apos;&apos; national&apos;&apos;leadership, but accept it because they see no alternative, because they aredragooned into doing so, and because it seems to succeed. (Again the parallel with pre-war Germany can be noticed.) If the British and American Govern-ments remain silent in the face of the growing propaganda and pretensions ofthe Zionist extremists, these moderates will continue to lack the opportunity ofmaking their voices heard and their influence felt. It need not be supposed thatwe can safely sit tight and rely simply on retaining a large military force inPalestine to suppress impartially any disorders that may arise. In a complexsituation like that of Palestine, military force is an admirable preventativeagainst disturbance of internal security, but it is little use as a cure. We should certainly maintain a substantial garrison in the country whatever else we do; butit will have failed in its first purpose if it ever has to be used. The extremeZionist leaders would not be deterred by a display of military force alone, lackingany indication of the policy which it was stationed in Palestine to implement.They would rely on the obvious political embarrassment in London and washington which would be entailed in ordering .British (or for that matterAmerican) troops to &quot; put down a Jewish rebellion &quot; or even to fire on Zionistdemonstrations. However inconsistent with the actual facts of the situation to-day in. Palestine, there is a body of opinion amongst members of the Britishand American public which regard the Jews in Palestine as an &quot; oppressed &quot; and&quot; defenceless&quot; people. The entire force of the world-wide Zionist propagandamachine would be mobilised, in these circumstances, to present events in Palestinem this convenient emotional light and so to paralyse any effective action by-security forces whose only directive was to &quot; maintain order.&quot; The unfortunate[25550] ,      - &apos; 1 B 2
British Army might well find itself in the position of the Berlin Police on the night of the Reichstag Fire.10. The second alternative, if His Majesty&apos;s Government considered it justor expedient to do so, would be to come out openly to a greater or less extent insupport of the extreme Zionist programme. It is sometimes said, mainly by-Zionist leaders of the type of Dr. Weizmann, that &apos;&apos; a little firmness &apos;&apos; ,is allthat is required in Palestine, and that if only His Majesty&apos;s Government were to announce clearly and decisively enough that they intend to support the Zionistinterpretation of the Balfour Declaration and all that it implies, there wouldbe &quot;no trouble from the Arabs.&quot; I have found no support whatever anywhere in the Middle East for this view. In fact, I believe the exact contrary to be thecase. Not only would the Arabs of Palestine rebel with the fanaticism and violence born of despair; but their cause would engage the active sympathy of allthe surrounding Arab States, probably expressing itself in &quot; intervention&quot; onthe model of the Spanish Civil War (for example, elements of the Iraqi Armydisguised as &quot;volunteers&quot;). The Arab States have been given the most clearassurances that the White Paper of 1939 remains the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. An open repudiation of that policy would be impossible to explainconvincingly and would be read everywhere as a deliberate breach of faith. in short, we should find ourselves at war, in varying degrees, with the whole middle east.11. It goes without saying that either of the above alternative courses would put right out of court any question of peaceful constructive development in theMiddle.East generally on the lines suggested in my paper on the creation of a middle East Economic Council. Instead, whatever the outcome of the actualfighting, we should have to contend everywhere with the bitterest anti-british feeling and an utter refusal to co-operate in any kind of orderly system underthe leadership of Britain and America. (Incidentally, an ideal opportunity wouldbe presented to the U.S.S.R., if they desired it, to usurp our leadership andincorporate the Middle East in the Russian sphere of influence.) Our positionin the Middle East, in so far as we were able to maintain it, would rest on forcealone.12. There is a third course open to us; and that is to&quot; face now theconsequences of allowing national extremism to develop unchecked in Palestine,and to take provisional measures decisive enough to give a good hope of retaining the initiative in our own hands. Uncertainty as to the future is the curse of thesituation in Palestine. If things are left as they are, the uncertainty will be resolved by direct, and violent action by the strongest party on the spot. We canonly seek to prevent this by coming forward with a clear forecast of our ownintentions. What I have in mind is that the British and American Governments,with all the prestige which they and their leaders possess, should declare publiclyand. categorically (a) that, subject to the fulfilment of the strategic requirements necessary to preserve world peace, they are prepared to accept any solution of&apos;thePalestine problem which may be fully agreed upon between the arabs and Jews of Palestine; but(b) that, in any event, they have no intention of permitting or surrenderingto forceful changes of any kind in the administration of Palestine;and, in particular, they would regardrthe forcible establishment of a jewish State as contrary to the Atlantic Charter and to the principles on which the peace settlement must be based.13. I believe that such a declaration would clear the air in two important respects : First, by showing that the British and American Governments haveno intention of being stampeded into acquiescence in a fait accompli, it would much diminish the prospects of the fait accompli being attempted. It woulddepress the prestige of the extremist Jewish leaders and correspondingly raise thehopes and influence of the Jewish moderates. Secondly, by reassuring the Arabsgenerally on the intentions of the United Nations, it would check that slide intoxenophobia and morbid hostility to the West and everything it stands for whichthere is otherwise serious reason to fear.14. This paper is concerned first and foremost with the dangers of thesituation facing us now and at the end of the war. I do not think it is necessary,or indeed possible, to examine at length the policies, aside from this one centralissue, which His Majesty&apos;s Government should follow in Palestine when the war
is over. I cherish no illusions of any early or simple solution of the positiveproblem of teaching the two races to live together. It is something which theymust learn for themselves; it may be a generation before Palestine is at all a&apos;&apos; normal&apos;&apos; country. During the interval it may well be necessary to retain aconsiderable degree of outside control; and it will certainly be necessary for.HisMajesty&apos;s Government to keep a substantial garrison there for some years tocome. But we can at least create conditions in which the lesson can be learnt. Itmay then be possible to foresee a continuance of Jewish immigration into palestine (should there be any substantial demand for it in post-war conditions),subject, of course, to regulation according to the economic state of the country,and to provisions against any sudden unco-ordinated inrush such as provoked theoutbreak of 1936-38. One would also like to see the Palestine Government putin a position to embark on a programme of social services on a scale comparable with modern European standards, in order to attract the moderates of bothraces particularly the Jews towards co-operation in economic and socialbetterment and away from too exclusive dependence on purely &apos;&apos; national&apos;&apos;institutions. (This would mean, of course, public expenditure on a scale far beyond normal colonial standards, which are, in any case, quite inapplicable tothe circumstances of Palestine. Considerable assistance from home would berequired, but I should regard that as no more than could be expected from us inview of our international responsibilities for Palestine.) Finally, it is generally agreed that some substantial measure of constitutional advance is long overdue;no country can be politically healthy which has had to be ruled for a quarter ofa century exclusively by an alien bureaucracy, however benevolent and impartial.These developments, however,, lie in the future.R. G. C.Cairo, 21st April, 1943.
