NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   There have been no outstanding naval events during the week.One U boat has been sunk, four probably sunk and two probably damagedShipping losses have been light.Naval forces have bombarded Panteleria harbour.U.S. troops have landed on Attu Island in the Aleutians.Home Waters.2. On the morning of the 14th M.T.Bs. torpedoed two out of four torpedo-boats or minesweepers which were escorting a south-bound enemy convoy off theHook of Holland.Early on the same day H.M.S. Tuscan (destroyer) was damaged, probably by mine, in the Bristol Channel and was towecl into port.Minesweeping trawlers destroyed three enemy aircraft off Harwich on the14th, and on the 15th H.M.S. Queen Empress (auxiliary A/A ship), of the local defence flotilla, and the Roughs Fort each shot down a F.W. 190 in that area.Mediterranean.3. Early on the morning of the 13th H.M.S. Orion (6&quot; cruiser), escorted byH.M. Destroyers Isis and Petard, shelled the harbour of Pantellaria while lightcraft patrolled inshore to intercept any enemy shipping. Two shore batteriesreturned the fire without effect.  Naval Albacores illuminated the target.Destroyer and coastal craft patrols were maintained round the Cape Bonpeninsula during the 14th and 15th, prisoners captured bringing the total forthese operations to 879 since the 9th. An appreciable contribution to the successof, the final Tunisian operations was the minelaying improvised by a flotilla ofM.T.Bs. which laid U.S. mines with the assistance of a U.S. minelaying party.4.   The following attacks have been reported by H.M. submarines : Safari, on patrol north-west of Sardinia, sank a small coaster on the 2ndand a trawler on the 6th; and on the 8th fired two torpedoes into Porto Torresharbour, sinking a 2,500-ton ship. Tactician sank a -500-ton schooner south-east of Elba on the 5th. Trident probably torpedoed a ship north of Corsica onthe 12th.5. The Italian hospital ships Laurana and Konstanz were intercepted byH.M. destroyers in the Sicilian Channel and escorted into Malta. A thirdhospital ship, Toscana, bound for Kelibia, was intercepted and ordered to proceedto Trapani.Three islands off the Tunisian coast have been occupied since the 12th,Zembra, Plana,- and Galita, the last-named by the French.The cable between Malta and Tripoli has been restored.H.M.S. Ilex (destroyer) was slightly damaged during an air raid on Boneon the 14th.Pacific.6. On the 11th U.S, troops were landed on the north and south coasts ofAttu Island. Fog hampered the landing of supplies and made air supportdifficult, but the two forces met in the middle of the island in spite of stubbornresistance. The Japanese appear to have withdrawn to Chicagof Harbour atthe eastern end of the island.In Far Eastern waters, U.S. submarines have sunk a destroyer, a small escort vessel, a transport and three cargo ships, and have damaged a large tanker.U.S. ships hombarded Vella and Munda (New Georgian Islands) during the night of the 12th/13th.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. Sixty-five attacks on enemy submarines, have this week been reported,52 of them by aircraft and the remainder by ships.. One attack was made inthe Mediterranean,
On the 17th U.S. destroyers and a Brazilian aircraft sank a U-boat off Baia, 47 survivors being landed.- H.M.S. Lagan (frigate), escorting a convoy, probably sank a U-boat inthe S.W. Approaches on the 13th; and on the 15th and 16th Halifax aircraftprobably sank two others in the same area. H.M. Ships Duncan (destroyer) andSnow flake (corvette), escorting a home-bound, convoy, probably destroyed a U-boatin mid-Atlantic before dawn on the 19th, and later in the day -Sennen (cutter), oneof a support group covering the same convoy, probably seriously damaged a U-boatsome 30 miles further south. A United States Army aircraft probably damagedanother west of Madeira.8. Since the inception of the special air offensive in the Bay of Biscav onthe 13th April, 91 sightings and 62 attacks have been made : two U-boats have been sunk and three probably sunk.Enemy Intelligence.German.9. Photographic reconnaissance of Kiel on the 19th showed nurnberg andKoln present.Japanese.10. Photographic reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 13th showed a light cruiser, seven destroyers, nine small naval craft and 25 merchant ships totalling117,000 tons. At Wewak, five ships totalling 27,000 tons were seen and 90 barges.At Kavieng there were a destroyer and three cargo ships.U-boats.11. The number of U-boats operating was reduced this week by the returnto port of a large number of those which last week attacked two Atlantic convoys.Enemy Attack on Shipping.12. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked ten ships, ofwhich seven are known to have sunk.A ship in an outward Atlantic convoy was sunk east of Cape Farewell, andtwo ships, one of them a tanker, north of Cuba. Two ships were torpedoed in an outward convoy in the Mediterranean; one was sunk and the other arrivedsafely at Algiers. Two ships, one sailing independently north of the Azores,and the other in an escorted, convoy north-east of Durban, were sunk. A tankerand another ship were torpedoed in the Fiji area. The hospital ship Centaur(3,222 tons) was sunk off Brisbane; there were 56 survivors out of a total of 326.A coasting collier was damaged by a mine off the East Coast.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending the 16th 837 ships were convoyed. Of these275 were in ocean convoys and 562 in British coastal convoys. Eighty-four destroyers (including 14 TJ.S. destroyers), 133 sloops, frigates, cutters and corvettes (including three U.S. cutters), one armed merchant cruiser, one oceanboarding vessel, three escort-carriers and one anti-aircraft ship were employedon escort duties. -During the week 85 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in Home waters without loss.14. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 15th totalled 896,000 tons, compared with 669,000 tons during theprevious seven days, and an average of 693,400 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 228,000 tons were mineral oils of various grades.British Minelaying.15. During the week mines were laid by surface craft in the Channel andin Northern Waters, and by aircraft off the German North Sea Coast and in the bay of Biscay.. [25463] b 2
Enemy minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. Aircraft have this week shown more activity than for several weeks,and minelaying was suspected on three nights off the East and South Coasts andin the Bristol Channel, where the port of Cardiff was temporarily closed.Twenty-one mines were destroyed off the East Coast, chiefly off Orfordness.In the Mediterranean H.M.S. Speedy (minesweeper) was extensivelydamaged by a mine off Malta and was towed into harbour. Clearance of theBizerta approaches has continued and 39 mines have been destroyed.The mine totals are : 4,308 ground and 2,523 moored.Spanish Intelligence.17. As the result of a very serious fire at Ferrol Dockyard, which destroyedequipment and irreplaceable electrical gear, the Spanish 6-inch cruisers Galicia,Miguel De Cervantes, and Mendez Nunez, and the destroyers Alsedo and Lazaga.are likely to be out of commission for the rest of the war.Enemy Merchant Shipping.18. The Norwegian s.s. Bygdoy (1,252 tons), carrying timber to Germany,has been mined and sunk in the Kattegat.Twenty-nine of the small ships engaged in the Bilbao-Bayonne ore tradeare reported to have arrived at Bilbao, and 23 ships, including the SpanishKauldi (3,153 tons) and three German ships, Livridia (3,094 tons), Bordsee(959 tons), and Sperber (889 tons), to have left.The Italian tanker Celeno (3,741 tons) was expected to arrive at Istanbulon the 16th from the Black Sea. The loading of chrome into the Bulgarians.s. Balkan (3,838 tons) at Panderma has been delayed by bad weather.MILITARY SITUATION.Tunisia.19. The First Italian Army was formally surrendered by Marshal Messeat 1045 hours on Thursday, the 13th May, 1943. The unconditional surrender ofthis force brought the North African campaign to a successful conclusion. Onthe previous afternoon General Von Arnim had been surprised and captured bythe 4th Indian Division in the neighbourhood of Ste. Marie Du Zit.Once the enemy commanders had surrendered, the Axis soldiery appears tohave had little desire to continue the fight, and from the 9th, when a stiff battlewas fought in the Hammam Lif area, the rank and file were surrendering in largenumbers. By the 17th, 224,200 prisoners, captured since the 5th May, had beencounted.The Russo-German Campaign.20. Russian attacks and German counter-attacks near Lisichansk were apparently on a,small scale and do not seem to have resulted in any importantchanges, although it is possible that the Russians have regained one or morebridgeheads.In the Taman Peninsula the Russians continued their attacks south-west-wards towards Novorossisk until about the 13th. In spite of heavy artillerybombardments, however, the Germans held their ground and later counter-attacked, regaining some at least of the positions they had lost in the previousweeks.Burma.A arakan.21. Following our withdrawal from Buthidaung the Japanese began tomove round the left flank of our positions at Maungdaw, thus threatening ourlines of communication. Accordingly, after all stores had been evacuated, our troops withdrew from the town. The withdrawal began on the morning of the12th and was carried out without interference from the enemy. It is thoughtthat the Japanese have had to withdraw part of their forces from the Buthidaungarea owing to supply difficulties, and our patrols operating to the roadButhidaung-Maungdaw on the 15th saw no enemy.- On the night of the 16th/17th a British raiding party landed at Maungdaw,where they encountered stiff opposition. P^ighteen out of 20 Japanese, whocounter-attacked with the bayonet, were killed.
On the 18th, in an action five miles north of Buthidaung, two platoonsattacked and routed an enemy force estimated at 150, inflicting 27 casualties.Upper Burma.22. Fighting continues, and in two engagements in the Sumprabum areaour levies claim to have inflicted 28 casualties on the Japanese.South-West Pacific.New Guinea.23. Australian patrols operating in the area of Mubo and Bobdubi (three miles south-west of Salamaua) have killed 130 Japanese during the week.AIR SITUATION.General Review. *24. Bomber Command aircraft effectively breached the dams across the riversMohne and Eder, and made a heavy attack on Bochum.U.S. heavy bombers, operating from this country, flew a record number ofsorties.Allied aircraft attacked enemy bases in Sicily, Southern Italy and Sardinia.United Kingdom.25, Enemy activity during daylight was on a very limited scale, only14 aircraft being reported over this country, and these were engaged onreconnaissance.   One was attacked by a Spitfire at 39,000 feet and destroyed.At night 139 enemy aircraft crossed the coast. Of these 87 were probablyfighter-bombers, which operated, over East Anglia, S.E. England, and greater london. Other small-scale attacks were made in the areas of Chelmsford,Tyneside and Cardiff. A total of 14 enemy aircraft were shot down by fighters and A A. fire, and one forced-landed.Coastal Operations.28. Two attacks were made on convoys off the Dutch coast; Beaufighterstorpedoed two ships, one of which was last seen on fire and heading for the shore,and Hampdens torpedoed two medium-sized ships which were later seen withdecks awash. In addition, three escort vessels were set on fire by cannon and machine-gunfire.  Two Hampdens failed to return.Off the south-west coast of Norway, a torpedo Hampden probably damaged a 3,500-ton ship, and night attacks by Hampdens resulted in an 8,000-ton tankerbeing torpedoed and probable damage, by bombs, to two other ships.Whirlwind bombers, operating at night in the Channel, seriously damaged a2,500-ton ship and damaged a 2,000-ton ship and five minesweepers.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 85 were despatched, laid 288 sea-mines;two bombers were lost.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day. . ^27. In favourable weather conditions, heavy bombers of the U.S. VlllthAir Force attacked on five days of the week, a total of 973 aircraft being dispatched against the following targets : -Aircraft      Attacked   TonnageDespatched.

Damage done at Meaulte, Antwerp, Keroman, Lorient, Bordeaux, Flensburg,Courtrai, and in the first attack on Kiel, is referred to in Appendix VI.The naval dockyard at Wilhelmshaven was not located but, as an alternative,73 aircraft dropped 154 tons of H.E. on Heligoland and Dune Island. From the attacks on the airfield at St. Omer and the port area of Emden and from thesecond attack on Kiel, no specific results are reported. In the week&apos;s operations,the bombers destroyed in combat 202 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 90, and damaged 102. Fighters operating in conjunction with these operations destroyeda further 21 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 12 and damaged 31 for the lossof 14 aircraft.U.S. Marauders (B. 26), operating for the first time from this country,attacked Velsen power station at Ijmuiden, but a second attempt to attack thesame target was unsuccessful, ten of the 11 aircraft despatched being lost.A total of 124 escorted medium, light and fighter bombers made 13 attacks on airfields in Northern France. The 57 squadrons of fighters acting as escortdestroyed 14 enemy aircraft and damaged others; our losses were six bombers and seven fighters. Attacks were also made on the railway centres at Boulogne andEu. and on a merchantman in Cherbourg docks.Fighter sweeps resulted in the destruction of a further ten enemy aircraft for the loss of four Allied fighters.Night.28, On the night of the 16th/ 17th, 19 Lancasters, from a squadron speciallytrained for the operation and each carrying a 9,000-lb. mine, were despatched toattack four dams, east of the Ruhr, on the rivers Mohne, Eder, Sorpe and Schweim.The results were highly successful. The Mohne and Eder dams, attacked by fiveand three aircraft respectively, were breached down to the lake beds and, as aresult, the lake at the former is now virtually empty and at the latter only one-eighth of the water remains; the normal contents of these reservoirs were about \ and 7 thousand million cubic feet of-water respectively, the &quot; Eder &quot; being thelargest in Germany. The resultant floods have caused enormous damage, theextent of which it is not yet possible to assess, but from the Mohne dam floodinghas now extended 60 miles west as far as Duisburg and, from the Eder dam, about20 miles eastwards to Kassel. Numerous power stations and bridges are knownto have been demolished and, amongst important damage, is the fracture of therailway viaduct near Herdecke carrying the main line between Dortmund andHagen. On the afternoon of the 20th it is reported that one of the main bridgesconnecting Oberhausen with the inland port of Duisburg has been swept away.Two aircraft attacked the Sorpe dam which, with a capacity of about^ thousand million cubic feet, is supplementary to the Mbhne and of entirely different construction, consisting of a concrete core faced on each side with anapron of earth, sloping down to a base of about 1,000 feet in width. The crownof the dam is known to have been damaged, but if the concrete core has also been damaged well below the crown, results from water seepage may take time to havemarkedly visible results.No results were seen by the aircraft which attacked the Schweim dam.  -The Eder dam was built to prevent flooding of the River Weser in theKassel, Minden, Hameln and Munden areas, and to store the surplus winterflow of the Eder. It is of no importance as a source of water supply. TheMbhne and Sorpe dams, on the other hand, are of the greatest importance to thewater supply of the Ruhr area, both for industrial and domestic purposes. Theirdestruction would leave the Ruhr dependent to a large extent on seasonal rainfall.Eight of the 19 aircraft failed to return.On the night of the 13th/14th, 442 bombers were despatched against Bochum,which was attacked in excellent weather by 351 aircraft; 967 tons of H.E. andincendiaries were dropped. A heavy and well concentrated attack was deliveredaround accurately placed markers, and damage, as assessed from photographs,is referred to in Appendix VI. On the same night, 168 heavies operated againstthe Skoda Works at Pilsen, where 486 tons of H.E. were dropped in goodvisibility. The factory was clearly identified by flares, but observation of resultswas rendered difficult by smoke and industrial haze. From the two operations33 bombers are missing and two crashed in this country.Small-scale attacks, by Mosquitoes, were made on Berlin on four nights ofthe week.. Weather was favourable for intruder operations, and 247 aircraft, of whichseven are missing, were despatched; two enemy aircraft, two small ships, twolocomotives and five barges were destroyed, and 84 locomotives, 20 trains andthree ships were damaged.
Mediterranean.Italy and Sicily.29. In daylight on the 13th Fortresses (B. 17) and U.S. medium bombers,with a strong escort of Lightnings (P. 38), made two concentrated attacks onCagliari and dropped 394 tons of bombs; large fires were started and damage was caused to piers, the railway centre, gas works and hits were made on at least two ships. Nine enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of one Lightning(P. 38).   The attack was continued at night by 23 Wellingtons.A successful raid by Fortresses (B. 17) was made on Civita Vecchia, whenthree medium-sized vessels were sunk and six others were damaged, in additionto which&apos; two large warehouses, fuel installations and other objectives were hit.Another attack was carried out on Trapani and nearly 100 tons of bombs were released causing damage in the dock area and town, and hits were observedamong six ships, one of which exploded;, this raid was intercepted by enemy fighters, five of which were destroyed, and one Fortress (B. 17) and six Lightnings(P. 38) are missing. A night attack on the same target by Wellingtons resulted ina large explosion believed to have been caused by a hit on the gas works. A forceof 52 Liberators (B. 24) bombed Augusta Harbour; the target was well covered,and direct hits and near misses were made on a number of vessels.Effective night attacks by a force of approximately 20 Wellingtons weremade on Naples, Palermo, and the sea-plane base at Lido di Roma. Duringsome of these raids leaflets were also dropped.Mosquitoes from Malta carried out intruder operations each night overSicily and Southern Italy. Numerous attacks were made on trains, locomotives,M.T., railway stations and sidings/factories and other military objectives.Sardinia and Pantellaria.30. On the 14th a large force of U.S. medium bombers and Lightnings(P. 38) carrying bombs attacked targets in Sardinia. Over 50 tons of bombs were dropped on Olbia Harbour, and two ships were hit and rolling-stock and storeswere damaged. At Porto Ponte Romana a carbonization plant was hit. bombs were dropped at the mouth of a tunnel S.W. of Sassare and the tunnel is believed to have been blocked. Two hits were made on a ship at Porto Torres and12 aircraft were destroyed on the ground at Alghero. Severe damage was caused to a factory north of Busachi. During these operations four enemy aircraft were shot down and six Lightnings are missing.On the 18th over 80 U.S. medium bombers with fighter escort attackedPantellaria and obtained hits on docks, jetties, barracks and grounded aircraft.aegean Sea.31. Beaufighters continued to attack shipping in the -aegean Sea. Fivecaiques were destroyed and five others were damaged. A vessel of 3.000 tons was probably torpedoed by a Wellington.32. Enemy attacks were made on Algiers and Bone but no serious damage,has been reported. On the night 13th/14th 30 raiders participated in a raidon Algiers, but most of the bombs fell outside the breakwater;. five enemy aircraft were shot clown by AA. fire and four others were probably destroyed.Operational Sorties and Battle Casualties. ....33. During the week 4,500 sorties were flown in the Mediterranean area and the following casualties are reported : Tunisia.Destroyed orMissing.     Damaged.Allied21 31EnemyDestroyed.60Probable.18Damaged.No account is taken of aircraft destroyed on the ground.
Russia.34. The Soviet Air Force effort against railway junctions and enemyairfields has been on a reduced scale. In the Kuban support has been providedfor the Russian land forces, and airfields and communications have been defendedagainst enemy attacks.Russian bombers attacked Warsaw and a number of trains are reported tohave been hit and large explosions were observed.The German Air Force has attacked the Soviet railway system behind, thefront, particularly in the Donetz sector. Cannon aircraft have been employedwith apparent success against Russian landing-craft attempting to form a bridge-head behind the German lines at Temriuk in the Kuban area.Burma.35. In North Burma, Kittyhawks (P. 40) destroyed five buildings, believed to contain stores, at Kamaing (32 miles W.N.W. of Myitkyina) and startedseveral fires at Sumprabum. Liberators (B. 24) bombed an enemy headquarters atMyitkyina.In Central Burma, Mitchells (B. 25) made ten attacks on railway installa-tions and other objectives in the Mandalay area and one on Zigon (118 miles .N.W. of Mandalay) where considerable damage was done to rolling stock andto the centre of the railway^ yards. Wellingtons made two night attacks on the airfield at Kangaung (25 miles S.S.W. of Mandalay) which was also attacked by hurricanes and Hudsons in daylight.In the Mayu Peninsula and Akyab areas, escorted Blenheims attacked enemy occupied towns and villages, supply dumps and river craft; 25 sampanswere sunk and many others damaged.In the South, Liberators (B. 24) dropped 26 tons of bombs on the Syriamrefinery at Rangoon causing considerable damage. Bassein, Prome andMartaban were also effectively attacked; at Martaban, severe damage was done to docks and warehouses.. Thirty-six escorted enemy bombers attacked Kunming destroying two air-craft on the ground; war hawks (P. 40) intercepted and destroyed 13 enemy aircraft and a further ten were probably destroyed.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.36. Apart from two attacks by medium and light bombers on Lae airfield,where several aircraft on the ground are believed to have been set on fire, Alliedactivity has consisted mainly of attacks by single aircraft on targets in theFinschafen area.Enemy activity was on an increased scale. Two attacks, each by about20 escorted bombers, were made on Wau and 64 aircraft made two attacks on our positions south of Salamaua. Twenty escorted bombers attempting to attack OroBay were intercepted by fighters which destroyed 16 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further six; two Allied fighters were lost.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week :-Germany.Dortmund.-Photographs obtained on the 13th May show the town .and harbour covered with light cloud but nevertheless an immediate interpretationreveals heavy damage in the town centre, on the N.E. side of the town and on theN.W. side around the harbour. Many important works are involved and on theE. side of the Kanal Hafen there is an area of industrial devastation of - 45^ acres.Amongst factories severely damaged are the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G.and the Hoesche Eisein und Stahlwerke A.G. There is also severe damage and destruction to sheds in the railway workshops at Dortmund Enscheden Bahnhof.Duisburg. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the13th May shows considerable further damage in the town and surroundingdistricts/the main concentrations being in Papendell and Neudorf, particularlyaround the main Duisburg railway station, which has received a number of direct hits.. In south Hamborn, the district west of the Duisburg-Meiderich station was largely obscured by smoke and considerable fire damage may be expected inthat area.The Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. has been damaged over two acres and there is serious damage to the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. railway workshops.In the Oberhausen and Mulheim areas, photographs of fair quality showsevere damage to several large workshops of the Babcock and Wilcox boilerfactory, and to a possible extension of the Thyssen works. A road bridge over theriver Ruhr has collapsed as a result of a direct hit and the main building of theSpeldorf railway station has been burnt out. There are several hits on railwaytracks, and many incidents of damage to residential property.Essen. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 14th may show further damage to the Krupps works as a result of the attack on the30th April/1st May.On the west side of the works, some large machine shops have been destroyedover an area of 8,700 square yards. The roofs of several other machine shops havebeen partially destroyed, one of them over an area of 16,000 square yards, andthere is glass damage to two railway shops. A three-bay shed to the N.E. ofthe factory area has been destroyed over half its length, and in the central partof the works the roofs of two bays of the sheet-rolling mills have been destroyed,over an&apos; area of 900 square yards, and several other bays have been damaged by blast.Bochum. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the 14thand 15th May shows widespread damage, due mainly to fire, and most severe inthe town centre. In the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. one large building is almostentirely demolished and four others very severely damaged. Two branches of thisworks at Weitmar have also been affected, and amongst other industrial buildingsdamaged are the Gebruder Eickhoff (mining machinery) at Hunscheidtfeld, theDeutsch Lux Bergwerk at Wiemelshausen and buildings belonging to the PrinzRegent mine.Immediately north of the main railway station, an area of approximately12 acres of business and residential property has been devastated, while smallerareas totalled about five acres. There are at least four direct hits on the main station buildings and the roundhouse has been damaged. At the North Station ianother roundhouse has been damaged and, at&apos; Bochum South marshalling yard,some sheds have been destroyed. Amongst public buildings hit is the Town Hall,which has been severely damaged.Kiel. Photographs taken during the attack by U.S.A.A.F. aircraft on the14th May show that the main weight of the attack fell on the Germania ship-building yard, the southern part of the Deutsche Werke yard and on the areaimmediately to the east of these yards.
