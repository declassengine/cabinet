NAVAL SITUATION.General Review..1. Shipping losses have been light. To some extent this is probably due tothe increasing use of escort carriers, which have had some success against U-boats.Two U-boats have been sunk, two probably sunk, four possibly sunk, and fourprobably damaged.Bizerba, although badly damaged, is now partly usable.The main strength of the Japanese Fleet has been concentrated in their home waters at the expense of the S.W. Pacific.Home Waters.2. On the night of the 23rd/24th, a group of eight E-boats which wereminelaying south of the Isle of Wight was attacked by Naval Albacores. two -boats were sunk and two others damaged.On the night of the 26th/27th, M.T.Bs. engaged four armed trawlers offthe Dutch coast and set one on fire.  There was one casualty in the M.T.Bs.Mediterranean.3. Two eastbound convoys have passed through the Sicilian Channel duringthe week without incident.The following attacks have been reported by H.M. and Allied submarines : Papanicolis (Greek) sank two caiques by gunfire and ramming, north ofCrete, and took ten prisoners on the 8th. Shakespeare sank two small schoonerssouth-west of Corsica on the 13th and shelled the airfield at Calvi (W. Corsica)on the 20th. Unruly torpedoed a northbound 4,000-ton ship off the east coast ofSicily on the 16th.H.M.S. Laforey (destroyer) sank a 400-ton vessel in the Sicilian Channel onthe 23r.d.H.M.S. Eggesford (destroyer) shot down an enemy aircraft north of Boneon the 21st and took three of the crew prisoner.H.M.S. Fantome (minesweeper) was damaged by a mine while sweeping offBizerta on the 20th and was towed into port.   There were three casualties.4. At Carriere (Bizerta) three underground fuel tanks, with a totalcapacity of 30,000 tons, appear to be sound. Deep berths for two large cruisersare available alongside. At Ferryviile three berths of 200/250 feet in lengthalongside the quays remain clear. All the five jetties have been badly damaged.The docks are obstructed, although berths are available in two of them. Therewas much general damage, but about half the machine, carpentrjr and foundryshops are already serviceable.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. Reports have been received of 56 attacks on U-boats during the week;43 by aircraft and 13 by surface craft. All of these attacks were carried out inthe Atlantic, except for four in the Mediterranean and one in the Pacific. Detailshave not yet been received of a number of additional attacks which were made bythe surface escorts of two Atlantic convoys.On the 22nd aircraft from the U.S.S. Bogue (escort-carrier), which was witha support group escorting an outward-bound convoy, attacked three U-boats in mid-Atlantic. One U-boat, from which survivors were picked up, surrenderedand sank; one was probably, and the third possibly, damaged.On the following day a Swordfish from H.M.S. Archer (escort-carrier), witha support group escorting a homeward-bound Atlantic convoy, sank a U-boat&quot;from which 11 survivors were rescued.*HM. Submarine Sickle, south of Toulon, probably sank a U-boat on the 20thand possibly another on the 21st.Other U-boats were possibly sunk by the U.S.S. Nields (destroyer) off theAlgerian coast, by H.M.S. Ness (frigate) west of Cape Finisterre and by aU.S. Catalina (PBY) west of Casablanca.Aircraft probably damaged U-boats in attacks on the 17th and 19th south-west of Iceland (C).A Japanese U-boat was probably sunk on the 14th in the North Pacific bythe U.S. destroyers Farragut and Edwards.
387Enemy Intelligence.German.6. Photographic reconnaissance on the 21st showed the Hipper at Pillauand the Prinz Eugen at Gdynia. The Scheer was seen on the 20th to have leftSwinemunde, but is believed to be still in the Baltic.A floating dock, 400 ft. in length with a capacity of 10,000 tons, is reportedto have left Copenhagen on the 24th for Narvik.Reconnaissances have confirmed recent reports that E-boats and landing craftare being passed from the French ^Channel coast to the Mediterranean by way ofthe Seine and the Rhone.Japanese.7. There is a heavy concentration of the Japanese fleet in home waters,which includes four 16&quot; battleships, six 14&quot; battleships and seven aircraft-carriers with a total capacity of 366 aircraft. There appears to be no movementnorthward towards the Aleutians.Photographic reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 20th showed 23 merchant ships, including two tankers, with an estimated total of 150,000 tons.U-boats. .8. The casualties, recently inflicted on U-boats on the main convoy routesare believed to have reduced the number in the North Atlantic from 90 to about 70.There is estimated to be a total of 100 now at sea in the Atlantic and IndianOceans.Enemy Attack on Shipping.9. Only two ships, both tankers, are reported to have been torpedoed by -boats during the week. One was sunk north-east of Ascension and the otherwas sunk south of New Caledonia, in the South-West Pacific. So far as is known,no ship has been attacked in the North Atlantic.A tanker was sunk and another ship was damaged in an air-raid atSunderland on the night of the 23rd/24th, and a ship was sunk by air attackoff Cape St. Vincent on the 22nd. ..Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ended the 23rd, 1,010 ships were convoyed. Of these275 were in ocean convoys and 735 in British coastal convoys. Ninety-six destroyers (including 19 U.S. destroyers), 122 sloops, frigates, cutters and corvettes(including three U.S. cutters), three escort-carriers (including one U.S. carrier)and one anti-aircraft ship were employed on escort duties.During the week 121 ships in four ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters.Two ships were sunk:11. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 22nd totalled 513,000 tons compared, with 896,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 737,500 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 216,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.British minelaying.12. During the week mines were laid by surface craft in the Channel andby aircraft off the German North Sea coast and in the Bay of Biscay. mines were also laid in the Central Mediterranean.Enemy minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. E-boats laid mines on one night of the week off the South Coast.minelaying by aircraft took place on one night off the Tyne.The clearance of the Tunisian war channel has continued and 69 moored mines have been swept off Cape Bon.   Progress is slow owing to anti-sweepingdevices.   The total number of mines destroyed off Tunisia since the 9th is 123.&apos;Part of the Tunisia-Tripolitania war channel has been cleared.  Mines have been sighted in Bizerta Lake and a clearance sweep is in progress.The mine totals are : 4,320 ground and 2,599 moored.Japanese aircraft are believed to have laid mines on the 20th off RussellIsland in the Solomons. There have been no previous reports of minelaying by aircraft in the Far East.       ([25487] &quot; b 2
Enemy Merchant Shipping.14. Photographic reconnaissances show that between the 1st November,1942, and the 30th April, 1943, ten keels for merchant ships of 2,000-3,000 tons were laid down in German shipyards. A similar ship which was begun theprevious July Was the first cargo ship to be laid down for three years.Two tankers carrying a total of 17,000 tons, of &quot;oil are reported to havereached northern Norway recently in convoy.Thirteen arrivals and 17 sailings of ore ships have been reported from Bilbaoduring the week. ^15. During the period the 16th to 30th April, 33 enemy ships totalling103,120 tons were sunk, captured or became constructive total losses, 10 ships of23,313 tons were seriously damaged and a further 13 ships of 16,300 tons were damaged. The total number of enemy merchant ships which have been sunk,captured or become constructive total losses since the beginning of the war is1,536 ships of 5,373,972 tons, of which 676 ships of 2,204.839 tons have beencasualties in the Mediterranean.vichy Merchant Shipping.16. It is estimated that by the 15th April, the amount of Vichy tonnagetransferred to enemy ports had risen to 389,000 tons of non-tanker, and104,000 tons of tanker tonnage and that the total of Vichy shipping, bothnon-tanker and tanker, remaining in Southern France had fallen to 315,000 tons.According to enemy reports the Vichy s.s. General Bonaparte (2,796 tons),which was employed on a regular passenger service between Nice and Corsica,was torpedoed on the 19th; 145 survivors were landed at Toulon.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.17. It has again been a quiet week, but there has been some slight increaseof local activity on various sectors of the front. The Germans have made a minorlocal advance near Velikie Luki and there have been Russian attacks on a small scale on the north side of the Orel salient.It now appears that the Russians hold bridgeheads across the Donetzimmediately south of Balakleya and at Isyum, but that they have no bridgeheadat Chuguyev as was previously thought.On the 19th, the Russians resumed their attacks in the Taman Peninsula,but these soon ceased and during the last few days activity here has not been ona large scale.Burma.A raJcan.18. There has only been patrol activity since the Japanese took up theirforward positions on the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road. The enemy has show no intention of advancing, but rather the reverse. This is due, no doubt, to supplydifficulties and dysentery which is believed to be prevalent.On the west side of the Mayu Range on the 22nd, one of our patrols inflicted12 casualties on the enemy without loss to themselves just north of Maungdaw.On the east side of the hills on the 18th, one of our patrols killed 15 japanese and captured two: the remainder withdrew. Parties of enemy have beenreported N.W. of Buthidaung but there has been no engagement.Upper Burma.19. In the Chin Hills the Japanese have displayed rather more activity andhave advanced from the north-east towards Fort White, some 30 miles west ofKalewa.South-West Pacific.New Guinea.20. The Japanese have brought fresh troops into the Salamaua area andhave strengthened their positions south of the town. During the past week 70Japanese have been killed in the Mubo-Komiatum, area.
North Pacific.Aleutians.21. United States forces have captured a partially completed airfield onAttu Island, and have driven the Japanese forces into three isolated positionsnear Chicagof Bay, the main harbour on the .N.E. coast of the island.AIR SITUATION.General Review.22. Bomber Command delivered its heaviest single attack of the war, when,within an hour, over 2,000 tons of bombs were dropped on the coal and steel centre of Dortmund.  Another large force of bombers attacked Dusseldorf.Allied aircraft made heavy attacks on enemy airfields and bases in Sardinia,Sicily and Pantelleria. &quot; -vUnited Kingdom.23. In daylight, 56 fighter-bombers flew overland and two attacks inmoderate strength were made on south coast towns. On the 23rd 20 F.W. 190smade a low-level attack on Bournemouth and a small force simultaneously raidedHastings and Bexhill. A sharp attack by 25 fighter-bombers was made onBrighton. A formation of 12 F.W. 190s, while approaching Folkestone, was intercepted by six Spitfires and forced to jettison their bombs. Fourteen enemy aircraft were destroyed, of which seven were shot down by A.A. fire.At night. 14 fighter-bombers flew over S.E. England, a few of whichpenetrated to the London area. Nine long-range bombers made a fairly concen-trated attack on Sunderland.  Two enemy aircraft were destroyed.Coastal Operations.24. Whirlwind bombers sank a 3,500^ton ship and an armed trawler offCherbourg and severely damaged a ship of 1,000 tons and an armed trawler offthe Channel Islands, where another ship was damaged by escorting Spitfires/Twenty escorted Beaufighters of Coastal Command, some carrying torpedoesand others bombs, attacked a southbound convoy of six ships with 11 escort vesselsoff the Dutch coast. The results of the torpedo and bombing attacks wereinconclusive, but many hits were made with cannon and machine-gun fire. OneBeaufighter is missing.A total of 105 aircraft of Bomber Command laid 359 sea-mines in enemy waters.   Four aircraft are missing and one crashed.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.25. On the 21st, high-level attacks by Fortresses (B: 17) were carried out against ports in North-West Germany. Over 200 tons of bombs were dropped by77 aircraft during an attack on the naval dockyard at Wilhelmshaven and 138 tons were released at Emden, where the United steelworks was the target for45 aircraft. There was haze over both objectives and, at Wilhelmshaven, an effective smoke screen was in operation; the results of the attacks are described as &quot;fair.&quot; Twelve bombers are missing from the 162 despatched. Thedestruction is reported of 78 enemy fighters, in addition to 11 probably destroyed and 23 damaged.Eleven escorted Venturas. (B. 34) attacked the coke and benzole plant atZeebrugge. Five escorted Mitchells (B. 25) bombed Abbeville/Drucat airfield.Two bombers and two escorting fighters did not return.Spitfires, Mosquitoes and Mustangs (P. 51) damaged 13 locomotives in occupied territory.   Four Thunderbolts (P. 47) are missing from offensive sweeps.Night.26. On the night 23rd/24th, Bomber Command despatched 826 aircraft to bomb Dortmund; 39 are missing. Weather conditions were favourable and,generally, bombing was well concentrated around the accurately-placed markers,apart from a slight drift towards the north and north-east of the city, A verylarge area was reported to be left burning and many heavy detonations occurred
at intervals amid the explosions of the bombs; in the later stages, ground detailwas obliterated by dense volumes of smoke. More than 2,040 tons of H.Es. andincendiaries were dropped, the former including 11 x 8,000 lb. and 313 x 4,000 lb.This tonnage exceeds by 25 per cent; the maximum weight of bombs previouslyreleased during any single operation and brings the gross total dropped by aircraft of Bomber Command on Germany alone since the declaration of war to over100,000 tons. Bombs fell at the rate of approximately 35 tons a minute, and the weight of this attack overwhelmed the ground defences. One enemy fighter was shot down by a Lancaster.Two nights later, 759 aircraft were despatch to attack Dusseldorf. Layersof heavy cloud, together with industrial haze, affected the precision of the bombing. Fires seen were numerous but scattered, although a few clusters were reported by late arrivals. A total of 1,959 tons of bombs was dropped.Twenty-seven bombers are missing. Three enemy night-fighters were destroyed and another damaged.On two nights, Mosquitoes dropped bombs on Berlin.Aircraft of Fighter Command and Army Co-operation Command, during&quot; intruder &quot; operations over occupied territory, destroyed three locomotives and damaged 22 others. Other transportation targets were successfully attacked and one enemy aircraft was destroyed and two were damaged over their ownairfields.  From these operations two Mosquitoes are missing.Mediterranean.Italy and Sicily.27. Six attacks were made on the ferry terminus at Messina by Wellingtons,Liberators (B. 24) and Fortresses (B. 17); the heaviest of these was on the 25thwhen a total of 350 tons of bombs was dropped. Hits were made on the ferryterminus buildings, the railway station, the naval oil depot, and the town. Over120 tons of bombs were released on Reggio di Calabria and on San Giovanni,where many hits were reported on the ferry terminus and railway sidings, anda tanker was set on fire. Enemy fighters which attempted to intercept the bombers suffered heavy casualties, 25 being shot down for the loss of threeFortresses (B. 17).An attack, which appeared to be very successful, was carried out on Grossetoairfield (90 miles NW. of Rome) by a force of 54 Fortresses (B. 17); bursts were seen over the entire target. In Sicily the airfields at Sciacca, Castelvetrano,Borizzo and Bocco di Falco were heavily bombed and well covered. A numberof aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and in combat 24 were shot downagainst our loss of 10 Lightnings (P. 38) and one Wellington.A raid on Porto Empedocle was carried out by 36 Marauders (B. 26) and- hits were reported on a Power house, a refinery and a railway junction.Malta-based  aircraft  carried out intruder operations over  Sicily and.Southern Italy. Locomotives, goods trains, station buildings, industrial buildings,hutted camps, an E-boat and other targets were attacked.   Sea mines were successfully laid at the entrance to Catania harbour, and as a diversionWellingtons bombed the town.Naval Albacores south of Cape Granitola obtained four hits on a ship of4,000 tons which burst into flames. A tanker of 10,000 tons S.E. of Catania was hit twice.Sardinia and Pantelleria.28. A heavy scale of attack was made against airfields and harbours inSardina by escorted TJ.S. bombers in daylight and by Wellingtons at night. Theprincipal airfields affected were Villacidro, Decimomannu, Alghero, Monserrat,Elmas, Milis and Olbia. Up to 60 aircraft were seen in the dispersal areas ofsome of these airfields, and the targets were well covered with fragmentationand HE. bombs. The attacks were considered to be highly successful, and hits were made on hangars, administrative buildings, fuel dumps and on groundedaircraft, a number of which are known to have been destroyed, but the totaldestroyed and damaged is difficult to assess. These raids were intercepted andmany combats ensued during which 61 enemy fighters were shot down for the lossof 11 U.S. fighters and four bombers. A formation of Marauders (B. 26) withLightning (P.38) escort, returning from a raid on Decimomannu, encounteredseven Me. 323s, which they destroyed.Formations of approximately 50 Fortresses (B. 17) bombed the harbours atTerranova and La Maddalena; damage was caused to harbour installations arid

All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) Apart of the tonnage in these columns&apos;brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3) ).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on. Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other, than United Kingdom and Eire

Four casualties.25th May - L.C.T. 626 and L.C.T. 624 damaged in collision.The following casualties to naval personnel have been reported :: Officers : 6 killed; 5 missing; 8 wounded.Ratings: 25 killed; 19 wounded.APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Germany.Flensburg. -Small-scale photographs taken on the 19th May after theU.S.A.A.F. attack earlier in the day show considerable damage to the newshipyards of the Flensburger Schiffsbau and to a .lesser extent to the oldshipyard.In the new Shipyard, which is engaged on the construction of U-Boats andfloating docks, four buildings have been damaged, including the frame andangle-bending shop (750 ft. by 125 ft.), which was destroyed over an area of830 sq. yards, the smithery and the shipbuilders&apos; shop. Four submarine slipsare damaged, each by one or two direct hits.In the old shipyard,, engaged on fitting out U-Boats from the new shipyardand repair works to M/Vs.,-three sheds were severely damaged, and a multi-bayquayside building (450 ft. by 200 ft.) was hit. West of the old shipyardwarehouses, covering an area of about six acres, were devastated, and south ofStrand Weg three other warehouses Were partially destroyed. In addition, aquay near Strand Weg was destroyed over a length of 250 ft., while the mainbuilding (300 ft. by 100 ft.) of the quarantine station in Branevel Weg was morethan half destroyed. *       ;
Public utilities suffered severely in that three main buildings of the gas works in Batterie Weg were gutted, and two buildings of the slaughterhouse in Brauerei Weg were destroyed or partially destroyed.There is damage to the infantry barracks and the mechanised units. barracks, to residential property south-west of the shipyards, and to the AktienBrewery.Heligoland. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the15th May show that seven barrack blocks were damaged by H.E., two of themseverely. The naval signal station was destroyed, and there is considerable damage to houses. . .The Mohne and Eder Dams. A study of the photographs from the point ofview of damage to railways has been made. The damage is severe and will:necessitate much heavy reconstruction work. The largest single item is theHerdecke Viaduct. The reconstruction of damaged embankments and the rehabilitation of silted-up crack will necessitate a heavy call on labour and materials. Traffic dislocation, especially in the Ruhr, must be considerable and serious congestion may well occur on the alternative routes through Dusseldorrand Duisburg. The Wuppertal area is particularly affected since most of itsdirect connections northwards to the Mulheim/Essen/Bochum/Dortmund areahave been severed. The cutting of the Schwerte/Frondenberg line means thetemporary abandonment of that route as one of the three main Eastern rail exitsfrom the Ruhr. The remaining two Eastern exits (via Hamm and Soest) will now have to bear the whole weight of this traffic.The National Zeitung of the 18th May had a notice stating that in Essenwater must be boiled before it is used.(This contamination of water supply must also certainly have occurred inmany other places.)Kiel. A final interpretation of photographs taken on the 16th May confirms the severe damage caused by the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 14th May. Damage is concentrated within the comparatively small area E. and S.E. of Die Horn,between the naval arsenal and the light railway. station S. Kiel. As alreadyreported, practically every building in the Germania yards has been affected insome degree, and they include four boiler houses and both power stations.In addition to the buildings involved in the Germania and Deutsche Werkeyards and the naval arsenal, there is important damage to shipping with a direct hit on a 1,600-ton U-boat and probable damage to five 740-ton U-boats (two ofwhich have capsized) and two 500-ton U-boats. A small vessel of 150/200 feet is .almost completely submerged with only the stern above water; a 380-ft. floating dock in Die Horn is partly submerged with one side resting on the bottom and a125-ft. floating workshop has capsized.Communications in the damaged area suffered considerably. There are morethan 20 direct hits on roadways in built-up areas and also a number on the main railway lines and the railway servicing the shipyards. Outstanding items ofrailway damage are (i) The station building of the light railway station on Lubecker Strasse,which received two direct hits and is damaged by fire over an area of1,260 square yards;(ii) The bridge carrying Wiese Strasse over the railway, which was hit by heavy IT.E. and blocked the tracks below; and(iii) The bridge carrying Lubecker Strasse over the railway.The very severe residential damage in areas bordering on the shipbuildingyards was caused chiefly by H.E. Some 25 acres have been devastated and approximately 220 houses or business premises were destroyed and 150 seriously damaged.Czechoslovakia.Pilsen. In the attack on the night of the 13th/14th May damage was causedat the Skoda Works and to property in the neighbourhood. Particulars of the damage and casualties caused are not vet to hand.France.Lorient. A final interpretation of the photographs confirms the very severe damage to the.north power station. Two open slipways of the radial slips were severely damaged and the gantries wrecked, while store sheds and supplies stacked
in the open in this area were damaged. Destroyed and damaged buildings in the south-western part of the arsenal were further wrecked, and the Frebaultbarracks have again suffered. The sorting sheds of the fish market received adirect hit, and five or six hits have cut almost all the tracks (damaging passengercoaches and trucks) in the approaches of the Port de Peche station.Bordeaux. It is now reported that half of the inner lock gate was blown tobits. The berths for submarines at the torpedo stores are not now accessible, andthe base for the Italian submarines on the South Quay is unserviceable. FiveItalian and six German submarines are trapped in the Basin. It is believed thatthe casualties among German and Italian personnel were as many as 400 killed.A further report stated that ail submarines will be blocked at least for several days. They are at present in their pens and when able to leave will only be ableto do so at high tide; even then it will be a delicate operation.The Bugatti and Achard factories have also been hit. Rolling stock in theGare St. Louis was destroyed.Locomotive Attacks.French railway sources reported in mid-March that on an average fivelocomotives per day were being put out of action by R.A.F. attacks. This report is confirmed by other sources.Holland.Rotterdam. It is reported that in the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 4th march the northern of the two parallel steel bridges carrying the railway over the riverSchie between Viaardingen and Schiedam received a direct hit and collapsed.Restricted traffic was only possible on the southern bridge which itself sufferedsome damage.Sea Mining.The German liner Gneisenau of 18,160 tons struck a mine in the Baltic atthe end of April.
