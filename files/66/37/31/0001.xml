In addition, very successful attacks were made on two more Ruhr towns, Duisburg and Bochum, Harassing operations by small forcesof Mosquitoes were conducted against Berlin (four times), Kiel, Cologne,Dusseidorf, Munich and Munster.Night Operations.Target.DuisburgBochumPilsenBerlinMoehne and Eder DamsDay Operations.Boulogne (Outreau)Cherbourg No. 6 Dry DockIjmuiden    ...       ...Poix airfield       ...       ...Caen (Carpiquet) airfieldMorlaix/Ploujean -airfieldCaen / Carpiquet airfieldTricqueville airfieldCaen / Carpiquet airfieldAbbeville / Drucat airfieldTergnier-locomotive worksAbbeville / Drucat airfieldOrleans -marshalling yardsNantes St.    Joseph    locomotiveworks   ...       ...       ...       ...Date.12/13 May13/14 ,,13/14 ,,13/14 ,,16/17 ,,13 May1314 ,,1515 ,,16 ,,16 ,,16 ,,17 ,,18 ,,20 ,,212122 ,,aircraft dispatched.572442168121961262412126613132124In addition, 78 aircraft were despatched on anti-submarine patrol.Mining.707 mines were laid.   The following successes are reported : On the 6th May a German steamer of medium size was mined and sunkin the channel east of Moen off the East Coast of Denmark[25533] B
On the 7th May the Swedish Sirvall (1,469 tons) was mined and beachedoff Arcona.On the 12th May a Swedish steamer was mined and sunk in the channeleast of Moen off the East Coast of Denmark. There is good reason to believe thatthe mining effort of the 27th/28th April and the 28th/29th April has so far cost the enemy from 40,000 to 50,000 tons of shipping.The following table summarises the known results achieved by the miningcampaign in the first four months of 1943 :-Sunk.

She hadbeen employed in German waters, probably as a transport for men and material to the Russian Front. At a time when the enemy is acutely short of tonnage andhis transportation greatly overloaded, this is a serious loss.Operational Achievements.Duisburg (12th/13th May).Weather conditions were favourable for this attack, and 1,559 tons of bombs were dropped on the city. Night plots show that the central city area was verybadly damaged and that the vitally important inland harbour also suffered. Daycover shows that the main railway station is almost completely destroyed.Damage to public and private buildings of all kinds throughout the area appearsat first sight to be so extensive as to disorganise completely the civicadministration.The main areas in which heavy industrial damage is believed to have been produced by tohis attack and the previous one on the 26th/27th April (seePrints 1 and 2), including the inland port and the Homberg zone west of the rhine, were not covered by the first day photographs. Serious damage to housing,however, was already seen in the industrial suburb of Oberhausen (N.E. ofDuisburg). Measures similar to those previously taken at Essen (closing of schools, extra distribution of emergency rations, &amp;c.) are reported. Later daycover shows that the centre of Duisburg-Ruhrort is burnt out.Miilheim (S. of Oberhausen) is also reported by the German High Commandto have suffered in the first attack, but details of the damage there are not yet available.Bochum (13th/14th May).442 aircraft attacked Bochum, the large city between the Ruhr and the rhine-Ems canal. Weather conditions were good except for heavy ground haze,which prevented visual identification of targets or results. Night plots show,however, that a heavy and well concentrated attack was delivered. Smoke fromnumerous fires prevented photographs taken on the following day from giving an adequate picture of the damage done, but it is established that the industrial area on the N.W. of the city centre has been badly hit.A summary of the industrial undertakings so far known to have been whollyor partly destroyed in Dortmund, Duisburg and Bochum is attached at appendix A.Pilsen (13th/14th May).168 heavies were despatched to attack the Skoda works at ^-ilsen. Elevennight photographs are plotted on the aiming point, but the main concentration,
which in itself is outstandingly good, is away from the works. Although, there-fore, some damage ha-, no doubt been done, important results are hardly to beexpected.Berlin (13th/14th May).The small force of 12 Mosquitoes which attacked Berlin on the same night asthe heavy attacks on Bochum and Pilsen achieved its purpose of confusing the defences, and it probably did some small but useful damage.Moehne and Eder Dams (16th/17th May).On the night of the 16th/17th May, 19 Lancasters carrying special 9000-lb.mines were despatched to destroy the Moehne and Eder Dams. The less important dams on the Sorpe and Schwelm were also to be broken if enoughweapons remained after the Moehne and Eder dams had burst. For an effectiveattack it was necessary that the reservoirs should have been filled by winter rainsand the approach of the dry season would enable full benefit to be obtained fromsuccess. The extreme accuracy of attack required made perfect weather con-ditions a further essential.The primary purpose of the Moehne Dam which controlled the level of the ruhr was to store the winter rains and thus maintain the supply of water for domestic and industrial purposes in the Ruhr even in dry periods. It was105 feet high, 2,100 feet long*and its thickness increased from 25 feet at the topto 112 feet at the bottom. The content of the reservoir above it was about 134million tons of water. This dam was attacked by 5 aircraft. In spite ofaccurate placing the first three aircraft, as was indeed expected, achieved noimmediately visible result but undoubtedly loosened the masonry. The fourth and fifth caused adjacent breaches estimated to cover 150 feet of the dam.The Eder Dam stored water to compensate the River Weser for the amounttaken to feed the Mittelland Canal and to prevent winter flooding in the Kassel,Miinden, Hamelin and Minden areas. It was 139 feet high, 1,310 feet long, 19feet thick at the top and 115 feet thick at the bottom. The content of its reservoirwas greater than that of the Moehne Dam about 202 million tons of water.This dam was attacked by 3 aircraft, two of which reported observing breachescaused in the structure.Two aircraft which attacked the Sorpe Dam were successful in hitting it.This dam, which also belongs to the Ruhr system, is of different construction fromthe Moehne and Eder Dams and is not susceptible of being breached. Theintention was to cause leakage on a sufficient scale to force the Germans to emptythe reservoir in order to effect repairs. It is clear that some leakage was caused,but it is not yet known whether the enemy can make good the damage withoutwholly or partially emptying the reservoir.The single aircraft which attacked the dam of the Schwelm produced novisible results.Eleven of the attacking force returned safely. Three of the missing aircraft attacked their targets.The most noticeable results- of these attacks shown by photographs taken onthe following days (see Prints 3-8) were the obliteration of power stations and villages in the course of the inundations and the large-scale destruction of roads,railways and bridges in the Ruhr and Eder valleys. These incidents, taken together, would constitute a disaster of considerable magnitude, even if no other factors were involved. The loss of life and livestock and the flooding of large areas of agricultural land is also heavy. Most important of the immediateconsequences were that the success of the operation added very materially to the atmosphere of general disaster and panic in the Ruhr and helped to spread itover other parts of Germany.The breaking of the railway viaduct over the Ruhr, which carries the line from Hagen to Dortmund, and the destruction of the road bridge (previouslydamaged by a bomb) between Duisburg and Oberhausen are important and willadd to the immediate and pressing problem of getting supplies into and refugeesout of the bombed cities N. of the Ruhr. It is hoped that the Ruhr itself maybe unusable for water transport for some time as a result of silting and destruc-tion of embankments. The Eder floods have inundated the low-lying parts ofKassel and have also waterlogged the airfield at Fritzlar the largest in thearea. r[25533] B 2
All these results are, however, unimportant as compared with the long-termimplications of the operation. As the summer progresses it is hoped that therewill not be enough water in the Ruhr and Weser to meet the needs of domestic and industrial consumers and also supply the inland waterways with their essential supply. A spell of hot, dry weather would be catastrophic, since thesupply from wells and other sources,&apos; though sufficient to prevent an immediatecrisis, will not see the population through to the winter rains. The situation ismade worse by the pollution of filter beds in the course of floods and by thesilting-up of docks and canals. At the very best, from the German point of view,very large resources of labour, which cannot be spared without serious damage to the war effort, will have to be directed to clearance and rehabilitation work.Results of Previous Raids.Dortmund.Day photographic cover confirms the evidence of night photographs that heavy damage to residential and industrial property was caused by the attack on 4th/5th May. The centre of the city has suffered devastation on a large scale,and the industrial area in the western outskirts has been badly hit. The Hoeschsteelworks (two miles N.E. of the town centre), which the night plots suggest mayhave been subjected to a considerable concentration, are not yet properly covered,but are already seen to have sustained heavy damage. The VereinigteStahlwerke A.G. have also suffered heavily, and at least twelve other identifiedfactories are already known to have been hit.Print No. 9 shows damage to the main railway station.Nuremberg.The following summarised extract from the Ministry of Economic Warfare&apos;sreport for March is of interest:  The damage done to the two Siemens Schuckert branches inNuremberg is likely to be of considerable importance. One of these inparticular specialised in the manufacture of transformers. It is more thanlikely that the process of rebuilding will be a major operation and that thegreater part of the equipment under manufacture has been damaged beyondrepair. Existing production capacity is known to be hard pressed, and it isdifficult to see how this loss can be made good.&quot;Sterkrade-Holten (N.E. of Duisburg).Considerable damage has been done to the Chemical Works and synthetic oil Plant. The gas-water generators have been hit and the main gas-holderwrecked.   The main silo for storing nitrogenous fertiliser is largely destroyed.Internal Conditions in Germany.The following is a summary of an article recently published in Switzer-land :  &apos;1 Germany is no longer able to conduct the war &apos; normally &apos; or as originally planned. Whereas the growth of the Allied strength is commonknowledge, the weakening of Germany&apos;s production power is resulting inimprovisations and disquieting special measures which are felt not only byParty Leaders and factory managers, but by every German citizen. U-boatyards and aircraft factories are forced to wait for weeks for parts from a factory that has supplied them with materials for years. Manufacturers are naturally disturbed when a factory making railway trucks can fulfil only acertain proportion of its programme. The German people are universallyaffected by the latest cut in electric current, and by a further reduction in thef&apos; tobacco quota to cigarette manufacturers. Factory workers know from theirown experience or from that of friends that production from time to timesuddenly stops because another factory, damaged by air raids, has been unableto deliver necessary goods, or it may be that essential raw materials arelacking. Later work is resumed because the managers always arrange even-tually to get what is needed so far.&quot; Directors, inspectors and bank managers naturally know more thanthe workers, and though it is high treason for them to state productionfigures, even the most Party-minded finds it difficult to hide his pessimism
and anxiety. The planned estimates of German factories are seldom fulfilled,often scarcely reaching 50 per cent., the average being about 70 per cent.This percentage is despite the fact that production figures for this year were fixed at considerably lower than for last year.&quot; The most striking factor for the fall in production is the transportcrisis. The development of transport was unable to keep step with the tremendous extension of Germany&apos;s &apos; economic space.&apos; Locomotives, trucksand grease are lacking. Air raids on important railway lines, especiallyjunctions, create avalanches of confusion and loss of time. It is now almost impossible to carry out the required transports and movements of troops.The necessary quantities of coal, food and other goods for the war industriescannot be transported in sufficient volume or quickly enough, and it has beensuggested that all private trips and holiday traffic should be stoppedimmediately.&apos;&apos; On all fronts the shortage of. German materials is showing itself. Therecent rise in the export price of Roumanian oil by 40 to 50 per cent, showsthat Bucharest knows that Germany is prepared to pay any price for petrol,in spite of the great output of synthetic fuel from factories in the Bohemianbrown coal area and in Upper Silesia an output considerably greater than was generally supposed.&quot;A. n.
