(43) 71st Conclusions, Minute 3) instructed me toarrange with the Secretary of State for Air for a technical review of theprogramme of aerodrome construction with a view to seeing whether it waspossible to secure . further economies in man-power and materials, and higherspeed of construction, by accepting lower constructional standards or by othertechnical means.2. A careful and detailed survey shows that the standards to which theAir Ministry is now building are as economical as is generally practicable, andin a number of instances compare favourably with the other Service Depart -ments. There do not appear to be any material reductions possible in thenumber or size of buildings that are required on an aerodrome; and practicallythe whole construction is now of standard hutting type.3. It is noted, however, that the Air Ministry has not accepted the samestandard of austerity as the War Office in the sleeping of other ranks. The WarOffice allowance is now 18 men to a Nissen (or 36 to a Standard) hut, against which the Air Ministry allowance is only 15. If it were found possible to workto the War Office figure, it should mean a reduction of some importance in thelabour demands in the immediate months ahead.4. It appears, from observations of the actual carrying out of the AirMinistry&apos;s phased programme, that, in a number of cases, labour does not becomeredundant as quickly as they have indicated. This is apparently due partly tothe carrying out of small works and extensions after the completion of the maincontract, which are within the competence of the Command to authorise. It issuggested that, during the next few months at any rate, the amount of new worksthat the Commands authorise should be drastically curtailed.5. There are certain minor works on airfields which the Air Ministry haveagreed could be deferred, which would, however, only produce a saving of a few thousand L man-months. In addition, it appears that some further .saving ispossible in regard to the improvement and strengthening of approach roads, whichare carried out by the Ministry of War Transport for the Air Ministry. If a lower standard were accepted here at least for the present it would release1,000 men or more.6. The Air Ministry has a maintenance force of about 13,000. Any reduc-tion, permanent or temporary, in this would produce labour to^meet the deficitcaused by the proposed cut. - ,7. The Air Ministry promised to the United States Air Forces a total of70 airfields, in addition to which the United States Army airfield constructiontroops are to build&apos; 12 airfields (originally it was to be 20). Only one is finishedand all are, I understand, behind original dates. If the United States construc-tion were more up to time, it would have been possible for the Air Ministry to postpone somewhat some of the airfields which have now to be brought intooperation by September.P.Ministry of Works,May 25, 1943[25490]
