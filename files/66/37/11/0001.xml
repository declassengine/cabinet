THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1943.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (43) 211.May 18, 1943.WAR CABINET.FRENCH OPINION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to see the annexed note byMr. W. H. B. Mack, of the Foreign Office, who was until recently british civil Liaison Officer on General Eisenhower&apos;s staff.A, E.&apos;Foreign Office, May 18, 1943.ANNEX.I travelled to Algiers in the company of General Catroux on the 18th April.As we had been held up together owing to weather since the evening of the16th I was able to have several talks with him, and I was glad to have theopportunity of helping to entertain him during this period.General Catroux had evidently absorbed quite a lot of the ginger which wasadministered to him by General de Gaulle and other members of the national committee during his visit to London. He told me that General Giraud wouldhave to agree to share the Chairmanship of the proposed committee withGeneral de Gaulle and would have to take into account General de Gaulle&apos;position in France. General Catroux had seen M. Queuille, the former french minister of Agriculture, who had been one of the outsiders discussed for the presidency of the Republic in the spring of 1938 or 1939. M. Queuille had alwaysbeen connected with the interests of the fay sans, among whom he enjoyed greatsupport. M. Qneuille had only just arrived from France and his information wastherefore thoroughly up to date. He had said that 80 per cent, of the paysanswere behind General de Gaulle, and that less than 20 per cent, were behindGeneral Giraud. This was also borne out by reports from other recent arrivalsfrom France. General Catroux had. also received indications that Americanpopularity in France was declining and that General Giraud had not gatheredany strength. He was regarded as the man of the Americans, to whom it wasconsidered he entirely owed his present position in North Africa. One of thereasons for American unpopularity in France.was the inaccurate bombing tacticsof the United States Army Air Force. Bombs were dropped by day in villages,-fields and all over the place, and the French drew a very unfavourable comparison between the methods of the Royal Air Force and those of the Americans. (Isubsequently heard this criticism from other Frenchmen, one of whom had leftParis as recently as the 5th April.) General Catroux had seen General Starkbefore he left. London and had spoken to him on the subject-1 gathered withgreat moderation. General Catroux told me that he was resolved to take a firmline with General Giraud, and he was hopeful.that he would be able to inducehim to agree to share the Presidency of the proposed central committee withGeneral de Gaulle.I asked General Catroux about the position of General Nogues. Fie saidthat Nogues would have to go, but that General Giraud&apos;s difficulty was to find asuitable successor.   The two names which had been mentioned were M. Helleu12038   [25454]
2(former French Ambassador at Angora and now in Syria) and M. de St. Quentin,the Vichy Ambassador at Rio, who had expressed his intention of - joiningGeneral Giraud, but who was not allowed by the Brazilian Government to leaveBrazil, I said that General Catroux&apos;s name had frequently been mentioned.This extracted the interesting reply that General Catroux considered that whenunion between the two Generals had been accomplished, the two most importantposts would be in London and Washington, and General Catroux clearly indicated that he regarded himself as the man for London.General Catroux saw Mr. Macmillan several times during the fortnight whichI spent at Algiers, but I made no attempt to see him again.At Gibraltar I met a General Suffren, who had escaped from France viaBarcelona and was on his way to London to join General de Gaulle. He described the latter&apos;s position in France as very solid.Mr. Rives Childs, the United States representative at Tangier, told me thatan independent Frenchman at Tangier, who had been very helpful to him duringthe last few years and has supplied him with accurate information, told him after a recent visit to France that France was now 105 per cent, or 110 per cent.VxauiiiSl/.There were some indications in Algiers that the Americans are beginning totake notice of the constant reports which are coming in of the strength ofGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s position in France, but the effect on some of them at least is,I think, to make them more apprehensive of General de Gaulle&apos;s presence on theNorth African scene.W. H. B. MACK.May 14, 1943.
