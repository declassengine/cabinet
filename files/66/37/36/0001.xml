THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOUERNMIfHTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1943XMOST SECRET. \j Copy No.W.P. (43) 236.11th June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.SUPPLIES TO TURKEY.(Previous Reference : W.M. (43) 51st Conclusions, Minute 1.)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE War Cabinet, at their Meeting on the 9th April, 1943, invited the allied supplies Executive : (a) To report the quantity and type of military and civil stores which wereavailable in the Middle East for shipment to Turkey in April, Mayand June.(b) To investigate and report what could be done in these three months toprovide from our resources in the Middle East and Persia/IraqCommands vehicles, tractors or any other special items of which theTurks stood in particular need and which were not available in the stocks at present earmarked for them.(c) To make ail arrangements so that high priority stores could be shippedto Turkey through the Mediterranean as soon as possible after theopening of that route.Shipments.2. I have waited to report until I could present a clear picture of theprospects up to the time of arrival in Turkey of the first regular shipments fromthe United Kingdom and North America.3. I attach (Annex &quot; A &quot;) a list of the military and civil stores which havebeen or will be made available for shipment to Turkey in April, May and Junefrom the Middle East and Persia/Iraq and Indian Commands. The total tonnage involved is a little over 100,000 tons.4. Before delivery of these stores is completed, the special convoy which left the United Kingdom in May should arrive in the Middle East, probably about themiddle of June. This carries about 20,000 tons of weapons and stores for Turkey(see Annex &quot; B &quot;) and 846 vehicles.5. Taking into account some 12,000 tons of materials which the middle east Command is providing in July for our Own operational dumps and construc-tion parties in Turkey, and releases of 5,000 tons of cereals from Egypt inaddition to the tonnage in Annex &quot;A,&quot; the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,estimates that the intake capacity of the Turkish ports and railways can be keptoccupied until August.6. Ships and stores have been made available to begin regular deliveries from the United Kingdom and North America by the earliest date that the naval situation in the Mediterranean will allow. It is, however, impossible, in theopinion of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, to send a further convoythrough the Mediterranean until the first week in August. If, therefore, the[25548]
present estimate of the Commander-imChief, Middle East, of the Turkish intakecapacity proves correct, there may, at the beginning of August, be a slight shortageof cargo for delivery from the Middle East to Turkey, pending the arrival of thefirst regular shipments. This situation will, of course, be worsened if there are any losses in the special convoy. Further releases from the Middle East, Persia/Iraq and Indian Commands are impossible consistently with the commitments of these Commands.7. I see no alternative to accepting this situation. The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, will of course be instructed to spread out deliveries in sucha way as to avoid a sudden cessation of deliveries to Turkey.8. After the first regular shipment, shipments will continue at the rate of40-50,000 tons a month, and these will enable us to deliver, by the end of the year,the military supplies we have promised for 1943.Vehicles.9. I attach a statement (Annex &quot; C &quot;) of the lorries, cars and tractors whichare being sent to Turkey from the Middle East Command and by the specialconvoy. No vehicles are available from the Persia/Iraq or Indian Commands.The War Office have been very closely into the position in the Commands concerned and are satisfied that no more vehicles can be supplied. I consider that the totalof 2,146 vehicles is a reasonable number for us to send to Turkey in the four months April to July.Summary.10.   I invite my colleagues to take note (a) That all possible steps have been taken for the delivery of stores-to Turkeyfrom April onwards.-(b) That there may, nevertheless, be a slight shortage of cargo for delivery to Turkey from the Middle East in the early part of August,(c). That a total of 2,146 vehicles will be sent to Turkey before the arrival of regular shipments from the United Kingdom and North America.&quot;.: . :        &apos; &apos;; :&apos;. . -   \ ---- -: A.
