This is-generally conceived in terms of our experience in the last war, i.e., of a war endingsimultaneously over the whole field and of a more or less united body of victorsmeeting together to draw up a peace settlement. But we are, in fact, confrontedby the probability of the war in Europe ending a year or more before the war against Japan. The situation that will develop in the interval may well have so important an effect upon the whole. international and domestic position that it isworth while attempting, even at this stage, some preliminary examination of itspossibilities.2. Let me assume that the European Axis Powers collapse some time beforethe end of 1944. The critical question for-the subsequent European settlementwill be : on which front will that collapse take place ? If it is on the eastern front and victorious Russian armies have not only liberated Russian soil, but arein occupation of Poland, Roumania. Hungary, possibly of Bulgaria and yugoslavia, or even of Eastern Germany, they will no doubt set up governments on the Soviet model as against existing Governments, whether on the spot or inexile. The area of sovietisation may even extend some distance beyond the actualarea of Russian occupation. This may be only a phase, and local nationalism may prove too strong for- anything in the nature of a permanent incorporation of eastern and Central Europe in the Soviet system. But as an immediate possi-&apos;bility it cannot be ruled out of consideration.3. A less difficult situation will arise if the German armies hold in the eastwhile British and American forces, helped by local uprisings, successively occupyItaly, the Balkans, France, and finally the central core of enemy resistance. Evenin that event, however, we must be prepared for strong Russian, objection to any policy aimed at European consolidation, more particularly at anything in thenature of a Balkan or Danubian-Polish federation. Such a consolidation is inour own interest, so far, at any rate, as a united and peaceful group of States inthe Balkans covers our Mediterranean highway. But it is no less essential to thefuture peace of Europe. Otherwise Eastern Europe will inevitably offer atempting field for the revival of German ambitions and for another war. in either event, we must be prepared for the possibility, or rather the probability, ofmore or less strained relations between ourselves and some, at any rate, of ourpresent Allies on the one hand, and Russia on the other.4. This position of strain over the European settlement will almost inevitably be further complicated by Russia&apos;s attitude towards the Far Easternwar.  Russia has remained at peace with Japan and&apos;is not likely to depart- from:[25496]
her neutrality except for good consideration, whether in Europe, in Persia or inthe shape of a Russian occupation and sovietisation of Manchukuo. In any case,she may think it good business to rest and recuperate for some time while theAnglo-Saxon Powers&apos;.are tiring themselves out, and in the hope of securing better terms for her support later on. She may even find it better business at this stagetot do a deal with Japan. She has, in the shape of air bases close to Japan, a bargaining asset of whise value she is well aware.5. Neither the European nor the Far Eastern aspects of Russian policy arelikely to improve relations between Russia and the United States. Americansuspicion of Russia will be aggravated by&apos; the resentment of Polish and other national elements in the United States, and by the Catholic fear of Bolshevism,possibly also by pro-Chinese sentiment if Russia occupies Manchukuo. Theefforts we shall no doubt make to come to some sort of terms with Russia overEurope may very well also put a strain on Anglo-American harmony andcontribute to the tendency, bound to.get stronger and stronger, for the american public to clamour to cut away from greedy, selfish, quarrelsome Europe and concentrate upon the Far Eastern War. Whatever the outcome of the nextpresidential election, it looks as if the United States may settle down to a compromise between isolationism and interventionism in the shape of concentra-tion upon intervention in Northern Asia. The inclusion of the Pacific, north ofthe tropics, and of its coastal Asiatic countries in some sort of expanded monroe doctrine would only be a natural development of American history and instinctivepolicy. Nor need such a development be incompatible with continued Anglo-American co-operation on the basis of an elementary division, of labour westanding, in the future as we have in the past, behind the American monroe doctrine, and America correspondingly giving general support, or at leastapproval and acquiescence, to us in our corresponding sphere of interest. Thatsphere might be defined as the countries of Western and Southern Europe, theso-called Middle East, and the countries lying round the Indian Ocean fromCape Town to Invercargill.6. What about our own people, here and in the Empire % By the autumn of 1944 we shall have been at war for five years. We shall have stretched ourselvesfarther in the reorganisation of our lives for war than any of our Allies. by then, too, we may have incurred casualties comparable to those of the last war.How is the spirit of our people, on service and at home, to be Sustained for yetfurther efforts and sacrifices of unknown extent and duration ? What note canits leaders strike in order to counteract the inevitable disillusionment about a new world order based on the unselfish co-operation of the United Nations ? To whatideals can they appeal ? Not least, what proof can they give of interim advance towards that goal of a better state of things, in the world and in their home life,which they believe to be the only real justification of the present struggle ?7. What I would suggest is that we cannot afford to lower our standards.What we may be obliged to do is to limit to some extent the range of their application and substitute for the vague and unfulfillable conception of our duty to set the whole world right our more specific and realisable duty.and responsi-bility towards that part of the world which comes within our orbit, i.e., first andforemost the countries of the British Commonwealth, and secondly those withinwhat I have described above as the area of our British Monroe Doctrine. If we wish our people to see through the war with Japan we must make themappreciate, not only what Australia and New Zealand did for us in our darkesthour, but what they may yet become in the fuller and closer partnership of thefuture. We must make them realise not only the difficulty and complexity ofour problem in India, but the immense possibilities for the security of the Empireand for the peace of the world in its satisfactory solution. In the conception of empire unity, not merely as a self-regarding scheme of mutual insurance, butas an instrument for directly promoting the peace, welfare and freedom of vastareas and populations outside its frontiers, we can put forward something that should appeal to every instinct of our peoples, to their broad idealism as well asto their sense of the practicable and to their deep underlying patriotism.8. It is not, however, enough to put forward a more precise and positiveideal unless at the same time we also give evidence of our own belief in it by ouractions. So far as Europe is concerned our peoples will expect of us a treatmentof Germany drastic enough to put danger from that quarter out of the picture for at least two generations if not for all time. That cannot be done by long-termpolicies of repression relying for their fulfilment on the continuance of an agreed
United Nations policy, for by then the prospect of any such continuance may welllook very uncertain. It can only be done by some immediate drastic.surgery whoseeffects will be permanent. The kind of thing I mean is the cutting down of theeconomic and military basis of the German State by the annexation of substantialareas like East Prussia and Upper Silesia, the expulsion of the whole of theirGerman population and their displacement by neighbouring peoples. I do notbelieve that this is a matter that can wait for some general peace treaty. unless it is done in the hour of victory it will not be done at all, and only if it is done thenwill it give real encouragement to our people to go on.9. Similarly, we should, I believe, get on as quickly as possible, at themoment of victory, with such measure of consolidation as we believe to be essentialto the future peace of Europe, and not hold back for some general agreement which will never materialise. If we are first in the Balkans we should push onthe setting- up of a Balkan Confederation then and there, while things aremalleable and our influence at its highest. Similarly, we should try to bringsabout a Danubian-Polish federation, if the Russian position allows it. AScandinavian union, and a working arrangement between Holland, Belgium,France and Italy may also lie within the scope of possibility. I am not, however,arguing so much for specific schemes as for the necessity of prompt and decisiveaction in remodelling Europe immediately after the German collapse in theinterest of its own peace and our security and to hearten our people for their future tasks.10. Similarly in the Imperial field we shall have to show to our own people and to the rest of the Empire that we mean to assert our leadership in a policy,of closer Empire co-operation by taking every practical step that the conditionsof the time allow. Such a subject, for instance, as Empire air and sea com-munication cannot be left &quot; in the air &quot; without a policy merely for fear of cutting across American ambitions in that field. The right of the BritishCommonwealth to have a policy of its own in this and in other matters, economicand defensive, is one of the things we must increasingly assert if that Common-wealth is to believe in itself. And we shall certainly be in a stronger positionto assert it once the European war is over and America begins to realise herdependence upon our help in what will be essentially her war.11. There remains the domestic field. If the present national coalition isto last it cannot treat the end of the war in Europe as merely an incident and continue postponing social problems to the return of a general peace. It may,indeed, prove to be the case that none of the major social problems can be solved by compromise on national lines. In that event a return to party govern-ment may become inevitable after the collapse of Germany. But if they areto be solved on national lines it must be by bold and early action. To let the carrying out of the Beveridge plan, for instance, or the initiation of our futureagricultural or educational policy, wait upon a consideration of our financialposition after the capitulation of Tokio is, I believe, quite impossible. If thenation is to take breath and face the continuance of the struggle, then recon-struction at home will have to begin, and on the boldest lines, the moment wehave beaten Germany and will have to be financed, as we have financed the war,by the same far-reaching expedients and with the same confidence in the eventualoutcome. -L.
