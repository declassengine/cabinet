THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1943. --: --- :-^---5SECRET. Copy No. 33W.P. (43) 215.May 21, 1943./WAR CABINET.CHURCH BELLS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.1. Church bells may now be rung only for the purpose of summoning persons to public worship on a Sunday, Christinas Day or Good Friday. Their ringingfor any other purpose, e.g., weddings or funerals, or on any other day is prohibitedby the Order I made on the 21st April to give effect to the War Cabinet&apos;s decisionof the 19th April &quot; that the present restrictions on church bells should be somodified as to enable the bells to be rung on Sundays and other special days to summon worshippers to church &quot; (W.M. (43) 56th Conclusions, Minute 10). ThePrime Minister considered it necessary to retain a prohibition on sounding onodd occasions in order to avoid alarm and dangerous incidents, as the public had for a long time been trained to regard church bells as a raid warning; he also considered that, as soon as it could reasonably be held that the public had been sufficiently educated not to regard the ringing of church bells as a raid signal, theneed for the present restrictions would disappear.2. The Prime Minister said in the House on the 22nd April that the significance of invasion no longer attached to the ringing- of church bells, andthis statement has been widely reported in the Press. Since the new Order wasmade the bells have been rung on seven occasions (Good Friday, the five followingSundays and at St. Paul&apos;s and St. Giles&apos;, Edinburgh, on the 19th May).3. There have already been Parliamentary Questions asking whether theOrder could be amended to allow :- (a) The ringing of bells for practice purposes.(b) The ringing of an Angelus bell.(c) Discretion to ring them on week days.4. Many enquiries have been received asking why the bells cannot be.rungon other days (e.g., Ascension Day) and on other occasions (e.g., weddings, funeralsand the installation of a new incumbent), and there has been correspondence&apos;and comments in the newspapers. In particular Lord Quickswood, in a letterto The Times published on the 17th May, stated that as Ascension Day is observed,according to the Prayer Book, in precisely the same way as Christmas Dajr, he isassuming Ascension Day&apos; to be included in the Order and is directing that thebell in Eton College Chapel shall be rung on Ascension Day. This is a Weekdayand not one of the special days at present included in the Order.5. It seems, therefore, that there should by now have been sufficient timefor people to readjust their reactions to the ringing of church bells. The bells,were, in fact, never used as a raid signal, and it is, therefore, perhaps less difficultto forget that they ever had that meaning. The bells of St. pauls were rung onWednesday, the 19th May, without notice and with no observable ill-result,6. The retention of restrictions on the use of bells, although they are no.longer used as a raid warning, is looked upon in some quarters as unnecessarybureaucratic interference when no matter of public security is at stake, and isalready giving rise to unfavourable comment. *[254661
7. As there are grounds for thinking that the public are now fully aware&quot;that church bells are no longer to be used as a raid warning, I suggest that therestrictions on their ringing should be completely removed and publicity givento the decision. The effect of revoking the present Order would be that theringing of church bells and other bells of a similar type would be permitted forany purpose at any time, provided that their sound would not be liable to bemistaken for &quot;a signal .... to indicate that an air raid by, the enemy isexpected or is in progress, or has ceased, or that noxious gas is present or thatdanger from such gas has ceased&quot; (Control of Noise (Defence) (No. 2)Order, 1939).8. If the decision should be against relaxation, I shall wish to have theviews of my colleagues as to the action to be taken if Lord Quickswood and othersarrange for the bells to be rung on Ascension Day.n. m.Home Office,May 21, 1943.
