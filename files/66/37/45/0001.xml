Note on the Protection of Dams and Reservoirs in the United Kingdom.Action by the Ministry of Home Security&apos;.1. Immediately the results of our attacks on the German dams were made public, the Ministry of Home Security, in consultation with the appropriated departments and experts, reviewed the vulnerability and importance of all themore vital reservoirs, dams and sluice gates in this country, bearing in mind thatthe enemy is now more &quot; water-minded.&quot;2. Taking into account the fact that the new weapon is probably effectiveonly against masonry dams, this review took a special account of the extent of the damage likely to be caused by a breaching of the masonry clams to (a) the war potential of the country;(&amp;) the lives of the population;(c) the effects of the loss of water on industry and domestic life.3. The Ministry of Home Security reported to the Chiefs of Staff (Anti-Aircraft) Sub-Committee that damage to those dams and reservoirs shown in the annex would have serious consequences and that these should be considered, inthe first instance, for A.A. defences. In addition, it was thought desirable toinclude the more exposed impounded reservoirs, such as the London Reservoirs,which have earthwork retaining walls and which are vulnerable to ordinaryprecision bombing.4. Meanwhile, Regional Commissioners have been instructed to make a detailed examination of the vulnerability and importance of all water under-takingsjn their Regions, with particular reference to the possible extent of damage to life,&apos; property and the war potential caused by the breaching of any dam. Inthis connection the Regional Commissioner of No. 2 Region has with the WaterEngineer carried out a personal reconnaissance of all the major water under -takings in the West Riding of Yorkshire in order to determine the possible extentof damage, in the areas concerned.5. In the view of the Ministry of Home Security, the danger of flooding inunderground tubes has in no way altered, and this risk remains of the sameimportance as at any time during the war.Action by the C.O.S. (A.A.) Sub-Committee.6. The C.O.S. (AA.) Sub-Committee were of the opinion that importantdams and reservoirs should be classified in the same way as other key-points.Having agreed which are the most important from the civil aspect, it was for theSub-Committee to decide on the vulnerability, likelihood of attack and correctdisposition of defences within the resources available. At the same time, due regard should be paid to the relative importance and defence requirements ofother vital key-points.
7. With these considerations in mind, the Sub-Committee took action asfollows :  (i.) Light A.A. guns and searchlights are considered the best method ofdefence immediately available. These defences have been allocated tothe dams and reservoirs in the Annex, and defences are now in action as set out.(ii) Balloons were considered as an alternative defence, but, in view of thefact that they might serve as target indicators, are not proof againstthe &apos;&apos; Kutonase &apos;&apos;; difficulties in siting and the existing lack of resources in relation to the claims of other vital areas, the committee agreed that the provision of balloons was not justifiable at the presenttime. For similar reasons it was also decided net to employ smokescreens. Reconnaissances for balloons and smoke screens have, how-ever, been carried out at these dams and reservoirs in the Annex sothat these forms of defence may be quickly deployed should further developments make this necessary.(iii) Certain dock gates at ports are also vulnerable to the new weapon and action has been taken to redispose searchlights and guns in their defence where necessary.(iv) The Admiralty are exploring the possibility of using observation mine-fields to protect dams against low-flying attacks. It was suggestedthat these minefields should be laid some 300-400 yards from theupper side of a dam and there was evidence to show that they wouldprobably be lethal to low-flying aircraft.(v) A small Committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Merton, scientific adviser to the Ministry of Production, and of which Lord Cherwellis a member, is investigating possible scientific antidotes to the newweapon.Further Action.8. The Ministry of Home Security is keeping the whole question underobservation and will forward to the C.O.S. (A.A.) Sub-Committee any furtheradditions to the list of dams and reservoirs which are deemed to be of sufficient importance to merit some scale of A.A. defence.9. On receipt of these additions and the results of the researches now beingcarried out by the Admiralty and by Dr. Merton&apos;s Committee, the C.O.S. (A.A.&quot;)Sub-Committee will review the existing defences of dams and reservoirs and suitable adjustments in the scale and type of defences will be made.10. The Chiefs of Staff have taken note of the action already taken andhave invited the C.O.S. (A.A.) Sub-Committee to report, making recommendations for permanent defences on completion of the review in paragraph 9 above.
