NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. The passage of naval forces to and from Spitzbergen and North Russiacovered by the Home Fleet has been carried out without incident.Naval forces have covered the occupation of Pantelleria and Lampedusa.One Japanese and three German U-boats have been sunk, one JapaneseU-boat probably sunk, three German U-boats possibly sunk and one probably damaged.Five ships have been reported sunk during the week. U-boat concentrationshave moved south from the N.W. Approaches.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. During the week the Home Fleet has been operating in Northern waters to cover the passage of naval forces to and from Spitzbergen and North Russia.Two cruisers and two destroyers left Iceland (C) on the 7th and arrived atBarentsburg (Spitzbergen) on the 10th. Relief personnel and stores for theNorwegian forces were landed; return personnel were embarked, and on thefollowing day the force sailed, arriving in Home Waters on the 14th.H.M. Corvettes Bluebell and Camellia sailed from Murmansk on the 9th and arrived in Home Waters during the night of the 15th/16th.H.M. Destroyers Musketeer and Mahratta proceeded to Murmansk, wherethey - discharged stores and embarked passengers and mail, returning to theUnited Kingdom on the 15th.Throughout these operations no enemy ships were sighted and there was no interference from enemy aircraft or U-boats.3. On the 11th the Jan Van Gelder (Dutch depot ship-tender) was damaged in collision off Belfast, and on the same day H.M.S. Leamington (destroyer), whileescorting a homebound Atlantic convoy, was damaged in collision and returned toNewfoundland.Mediterranean.4. During the night of the 6th/7th, a raid by our light forces in an attemptto destroy the R.D.F. station on Lampedusa was frustrated by enemy mortar and small-arm fire.After a bombardment of Pantelleria by two destroyers at dawn on the 11thand intensive bombing, assault forces from Sfax and Sousse, covered by a forceof cruisers, destroyers and M.T.Bs. from Malta, approached the island, whichsurrendered shortly after midday. Five destroyers and 14 other ships were employed transporting prisoners to Africa. The only naval casualty,H.M.S. Largs (landing ship, headquarters), was slightly damaged by a near miss.During the following night, Lampedusa was repeatedly bombarded by a forceof cruisers and destroyers in conjunction with bombing attacks. Shore batterieswere active, but on the evening of the 12th the island surrendered.Linosa Island, north of Lampedusa, surrendered to H.M.S. Nubian(destroyer) on the 13th. A landing party was put ashore and 140 prisoners taken.It was too rough to land on the island of Lampion, which appeared to have been abandoned.On the 14th enemy aircraft sank an M.G.B. and a water carrier offPantelleria.5.   The following attacks have been reported by H.M. submarines : Trespasser torpedoed a small tanker in an eastbound convoy off Toulon onthe 8th. Unruly sank an eastbound ship north of Messina on the 14th. Taurussank six caiques while on patrol in the ^gean. On the 15th she &quot;found a single-engined unoccupied Italian aircraft drifting west of Beirut.
Black Sea.6. During May, Russian naval and air forces sank three ships totalling15,000 tons, three schooners, four motor launches and 13 lighters. Twenty-fourother light craft were sunk or damaged. In addition one ship was sunk on the3rd June.Pacific.7. A U.S. submarine has reported that she has sunk, in the Pacific and far Eastern Waters, one destroyer, one large transport, one patrol ship, one small supply ship, two small merchant ships and one large trawler; a largetanker and a destroyer were damaged.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. Reports have been received during the week of 37 attacks on U-boats;16 by land-based aircraft, five by carrier-borne aircraft and 16 by ships.On the 11th a Fortress aircraft (B. 17) sank a U-boat south-east of Iceland (C).The Fortress was badly damaged by gunfire and was forced to come down in thesea, but not before the U-boat had been seen to sink stern first, leaving over20 survivors in the water.  The crew of the Fortress were rescued on the 14th.On the 12th aircraft from the U.S.S. Bogus (escort carrier) sank a U-boat500 miles south-west of the Azores. Seventeen survivors were picked up. Onthe 14th H.M.S. Jed (frigate) and H.M.S. Pelican (sloop) sank a U-boat in theN.W. Approaches.On the 10th U.S. Submarine Chaser No. 48% destroyed a Japanese U-boat inthe North Pacific, and on the following day the U.S. Destroyer Fraziev probably destroyed another in the same area. vThree U-boats were possibly sunk in mid-Atlantic by aircraft from U.S.S.Bogue on the 4th and 5th, but no details have been received. On the 6th a U-boat was probably damaged by a Fortress aircraft (B.17) south of Iceland (C).Enemy Intelligence.German.9.   Leipzig was reported at Libau on the 5th.Reports of the conversion of U-boats for the carriage of freight to the far east were confirmed on the 10th when a large Italian U-boat left Bordeaux witha mixed cargo.  Another U-boat similarly laden wasTeported to be ready to sail.Photographs taken on the 5th show that the caissons of the new locks at la Pallice and St. Nazaire were undamaged by the daylight air raid on the29th May.Italian.10. One of the 6&quot; cruisers has left Taranto and may have gone to theNorthern Adriatic.It is reported that the Fiume torpedo factory has been transferred ,toLeghorn.. Japanese.11. Reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 15th showed a Yubwi class light cruiser, seven destroyers, a tanker and 31 merchant ships totalling about135,000 tons.The movement of troops and supplies to New Britain and New Guineacontinues.U-boats.12. Of the 90 U-boats estimated to be at sea- in the Atlantic and IndianOceans, only ten are now operating in the N.W. Approaches. Several groups of u-boats outward bound have been sighted in the Bay of Biscay, the majority ofwhich are considered likely to reinforce those operating south-west of the Azores,and to form a heavy concentration on the convoy route from the U.S. to Casa-blanca. Group sailing of U-boats has presumably been adopted to counter the increasing threat from our aircraft to U-boats on passage through the Bay of biscay.  One or two U-boats are operating off the east coast of Brazil.[25588] .   &apos; B 2
Enemy Attack on Shipping.13.   Five ships are reported to have been sunk by U-boats during the week.In the Mediterranean a British tanker and a Dutch ship were sunk off thecoast of Palestine and a ship in an eastbound convoy off Bougie. A U.S. tankerwas sunk off the coast of Florida and a U.S: ship off the east coast of Australia.One ship in convoy from Lisbon was damaged by aircraft off CapeSt. Vincent.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending the 13th, 884 ships were convoyed. Of these,234 were in ocean convoys and 650 in British coastal convoys. Eighty-four destroyers (including 16 U.S. destroyers), 131 sloops, frigates, cutters and corvettes (including two French sloops and one U.S. cutter), two escort carriers,one merchant aircraft-carrier and one ocean boarding vessel were employed on escort duties.During the week 87 ships in two ocean convoys arrived in Home waters without loss.15. During the week ending the 12th imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 691,000 tons, compared with 1,837,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 807,100 tons during the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 266,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.British Minelaying.16. During the week surface craft laid mines off Iceland (C) and the dutch coast.  Aircraft laid mines off the Frisian Islands and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy. Minelaying, British Minesweeping.17. E-boats were operating in Lyme Bay on the night of the 11th/12th andon one night during the week enemy aircraft were possibly minelaying off the humber. Fourteen moored mines were destroyed off the Needles and 25 in an areawest of Portland. During the week 14 ground and 42 moored mines have been destroyed.The mine totals are : 4,365 ground and 2,907 moored.18.   In the Mediterranean minesweeping operations in an area east of CapeBon Peninsula resulted in the destruction of 33 mines between the 3rd and 5th.The mined area off Sousse has been cleared.Enemy Merchant Shipping.19. During the summer of 1942 the average quantity of shipping present at Rotterdam was 100,000 tons and at Emden 39,000 tons. At the end of May1943 reconnaissance showed 37,000 tons of shipping at Rotterdam as comparedwith 90,000 tons at Emden. In the main, Scandinavian ore was carried toRotterdam and coal from the Ruhr from Rotterdam.This transfer of shipping may be attributed to the following causes :  (a) The increasing success of our attacks by aircraft and light naval crafton convoys off the Dutch coast. &apos;     . ..(&amp;) The greatly increased number of sea mines laid by our aircraft off the frisian Islands.(c) The dislocation of communications caused by recent air raids on the. Ruhr.20. Sailings of blockade runners to and from the Far East appear to havebeen held up for the time being.21. Eight arrivals and nine sailings of ore ships have been reported fromBilbao during the week.22. The German tanker Wilhelmsburg entered the Black Sea on the 13thbound for Constanza. The Italian tanker Celeno (3,741 tons), fully laden, sailed from Istanbul on the 14th for the iEgean. It is reported that the Germans.s. Elbe (ex French PLM 16, 3.754 tons) has been damaged by enemy action andbeached off Odessa.
Expansion of Naval Personnel.23. The following comparative table shows the expansion of naval personnelbetween the outbreak of war and the 30th April, 1943 :  Officers- Sept. 3, 1939.

By 1330 hours on the 11th June, the landing of the 1 British infantry division was complete, only slight opposition at scattered points having been encountered.The population was found to be very short of food and had been withoutwater for three days. The defences of the island were of a formidable nature,including 110 heavy A.A. and coast defence guns, the majority of which werein permanent emplacements. There were also 70 light A.A. guns and numerousmachine and anti-tank gun positions. So far 11,199 prisoners have been counted,of which 78 are Germans.Lampedusa.25. Upon the surrender of the island on the 12th, one company of british infantry was landed.   About 4,000 prisoners were taken.North Africa.26. On the night of the 13th/14th, 40 enemy parachutists were dropped inthe Benghazi area, of whom 19 were captured the following morning, and 21 were dropped in the Oran area, of whom all but one have been captured. It is reportedthat further parties have been dropped.. AH those captured so far have beenItalian, and their mission is stated to have been airfield sabotage.Burma.Arakan.27.   The monsoon has restricted activity other than patrolling.Chin Hills.28. The Japanese are digging in to the east of Fort-White. Heavy rainsare causing difficulties in keeping open the Tiddim-Fort White road.The Russo-German Campaign.29. Fighting has taken place on various parts of the front in the Volkovsector, at Velizh, north and north-east of Orel, near Byelgorod and in theMius area but it has all been of a local nature and there are no developments ofimportance to report. &apos;.&apos;Russian attacks against the Eastern Front of the Taman bridgehead dieddown and have not so far been renewed.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.30. Bomber Command aircraft made heavy night attacks on industrial centres in North-West Germany.Fortresses (B. 17) attacked in daylight the naval dockyards at Wilhelmshaven,Cuxhaven, Bremen and Kiel.An intensive air bombardment was carried out against Pantelleria. airfields in Sicily were heavily bombed.Heavy Russian attacks were made on enemy airfields. Soviet industrial targets were attacked by enemy long-range bombers.United Kingdom.31. Enemy daylight activity was on a minimum scale; one F.W. 190,carrying out a reconnaissance at 33,000 feet, was shot down by a Spitfire overCanterbury.At night, activity was somewhat greater than of late; a total of 43 long-range bombers and 16 fighter-bombers crossed our coast. A sharp attack by 15 bombersconcentrated against Plymouth, and the following night 25 bombers flew overLincolnshire and Yorkshire, the main target apparently being Grimsby. Fighter-bombers operated over South-East England, and some penetrated to the london area. Eight enemy aircraft were shot down, including two by A.A. fire, and two others were probably destroyed.Coastal Operations.- -32. An enemy convoy of eight escorted ships was attacked off the dutch coast by torpedo- and bomb-carrying Beaufighters of Coastal Command, escorted by Spitfires. A ship of 5,000 tons was torpedoed and a smaller ship was sunk.Several of the escort ships, including a minesweeper, were left on fire.A Naval Swordfish attacked five E-boats off Alderney; three of the vessels were straddled by bombs.Spitfires damaged three armed trawlers off the Dutch coast and Whirlwindbombers damaged two others off Cherbourg.- Bomber Command aircraft, of which 93 were despatched, laid 183 mines in enemy waters; 2 bombers are missing.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.33.

The marker bombs were well placedand maintained, enabling the Main Force to deliver a concentrated attack.  Many ^extensive fires were observed.The attack on Munster, which was also oarried out in good visibility, wasvery successful.   (See Appendix VI.)At Bochum, where visibility was also good, the first marker bombs wereaccurately placed, but the initial concentration of markers was not fully main-tained; in consequence bombing tended to divide into two concentrations, thegreater of which was in the vicinity of the main railway station, and the otherto the north of the target area.   There were many large fires.Blind bombing attacks were made on Oberhausen and Cologne. AtOberhausen the sky marker flares were punctually and accurately placed and bombing was well concentrated. At Cologne the markers were rather widelydispersed and in the prevailing weather conditions were difficult to see; con-sequently the attack was spread over a wide area. At both places the glow ofmany fires was seen and several explosions were observed.Mosquitoes dropped bombs on Berlin, Duisburg, Cologne and Dusseldorf.Intruders flew over Northern France, the Low Countries and Denmark.Six airfields were bombed, several railway trains and barges were damaged and four enemy aircraft were shot down.Leaflets were dropped on Paris, Lille, and other French towns.Mediterranean.Pantelleria and Lampedusa.35. From the morning of the 9th to the time of surrender on the 11th, theair bombardment of Pantelleria was intensified. Fortresses (B. 17), medium bombers and fighter-bombers maintained a succession of almost continuous attacks,during which a total of over 3,000 tons of bombs was dropped, almost half ofwhich were released on the 10th.  Fighter escorts flew over 1,500 sorties.Enemy fighters attempted to intercept our bombers, but met with the minimum of success. Thirty-one enemy aircraft were shot down against our loss of two.S. Spitfires and two night-flying Wellingtons.At 1137/11th, a white-cross surrender signal was observed on the airfield.The air attack was then turned against -Lampedusa and during the next24 hours, up to the time of surrender on the 12th, over 750 tons of bombs were released.Italy and Sicily.36. After the surrender of Pantelleria and Lampedusa, the main weight ofour air attack was directed against enemy airfields in Sicily.The heaviest raids were on Castelvetrano and Bocca di Falco, where two attacks were made on each target by a total of 90 Fortresses (B. 17). Other air-fields bombed were Trapani/Milo, Sciacca, Borizzo, Catania and Gerbini. Inthe majority of these attacks 20-lb. fragmentation bombs were used, nearly 7,000of which were released in a single operation. The reports received were satis-factory, in most instances the targets and dispersal areas were well covered bybursts, hangars, administrative buildings and barracks were hit and in some instances put on fire, and a number of aircraft on the ground are known to havebeen destroyed. At Garbini three enemy aircraft attempting to take off ran intobomb bursts and were destroyed, in. addition to which 30 aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Only moderate enemy opposition was encountered and sevenenemy fighters were shot down against Allied losses of. four bombers and threeescorting fighters. Most of these airfields were also attacked at night, including one at Eeggio di Calabria.
A night raid by 50 Wellingtons was made on the ferry terminus, railwayyards and harbour of Messina. Many bursts were reported in the target area andsome large fires were started.Lightnings (P. 38) attacked two radio stations near Marsala, one of whichwas left smoking and the other blew up. Spitfires from Malta obtained direct hits on three factories in Sicily and bombed the airfields at Comiso and Gela. at night Mosquitoes carried out intruder operations against enemy communications.Sardinia.37. Villacidro airfield was attacked by 24 Lightnings (P. 38) and bursts were seen among dispersed aircraft and a bomber and one^ Me. 323 were hit.A similar force of Lightnings (P. 38) bombed barrack buildings and gun positions at Serbariu (31 miles SW. of Cagliari).North-West Africa.38. It is estimated that some 50 enemy bombers took part in a night raidon Sousse, but as the bombs dropped clear of the harbour no damage was sustained by shipping.- Two attacks were made on Bone by 15 and 10 enemy aircraft; no serious damage has been reported and five of the attackers (one by A.A. fire) were shot down.sEgean Sea and West Coast of Greece.39. Long-range fighters and medium bombers destroyed or seriously damaged 16 sailing vessels.   One Wellington is missing.Battle Casualties and Sorties.40.   During the week ended the 15th June a total of 9,560 sorties was flown.Sixty-five enemy aircraft were shot down. Fifteen Allied aircraft are missing.Russia.41. In the Kuban the Soviet Air Force provided strong support for the land forces.A series of offensive Russian bombing operations at night have been made against enemy airfields. In daylight a heavy attack was made on the railway junction at Orel, where several trains were reported to have been hit, and a numberof raids were made on railway stations south of Balakleya on the northern Donets.In the course of the raids on airfields the Russians claim to have destroyed or damaged over 300 aircraft, chiefly on the ground. The official claims for theweek ended the 12th June were 498 German aircraft destroyed for the loss of153 of their own.German raids on industrial targets far behind the front were maintained,and although the claim to have made 1,000 sorties against Gorki is now thought to have been exaggerated, most recent attacks were on a considerable scale.Targets attacked include Mitschurinsk (200 miles east of Orel), where the mainweight of attack was directed against the railway junction, rubber works atJaroslav (N.E. of Moscow), oil refineries at Saratov on the Middle Volga (about450 miles E. of Orel), and the tank works at Gorki.This offensive against industrial targets was in addition to normal bomberactivity against railways, marshalling yards and communications behind the front.A recent feature of German policy has been sustained attacks on Sovietairfields from Orel southwards. These attacks probably represent the Germanreaction to the increased weight of Soviet offensive air operations and an attemptto ground the Soviet Air Force; there is no evidence that they have succeeded in reducing Russian bombing attacks or weakening Russian fighter defences.India and Burma.42. In the Arakan, fighter bombers made daily attacks on enemy targets inthe Akyab, Mayu and other areas. At Akyab, an important building occupied bythe enemy was demolished and a W/T station and a jetty were damaged.In the Upper Chindwin, medium and fighter bombers attacked villages,stockades, M.T. and communications, especially near Kalewa and Kalemyo; abridge was destroyed and a generator station was damaged. Attacks were also made on small craft on the Chindwin River, several of which were destroyed or damaged.  Supplies were dropped for our troops in the Chin Hills.
In the Mandalay area, heavy, medium and fighter bombers carried out severalattacks on railways. A total of 36 tons of bombs was dropped on the railway centres at Thazi and Ywataung and on dock and railway installations atMandalay. The northern approach to the Myitnge bridge was destroyed and much damage was caused to rolling-stock, petrol dumps and river boats.In the Magwe area, successful attacks were made on enemy shipping and oil installations on the Irrawaddy River.Railway installations at Thanbyuzayat (90 miles NW. of Rangoon) were attacked by six Liberators (B. 24); tracks, warehouses and supply dumps were hit.Four Liberators (B.&apos;24) dropped two tons of bombs on radio installations onDiamond Island (143. miles S.W. of Rangoon), destroying one building and damaging several others.China and French Indo-China.43.   In the Hankow total of 21 Kittyhawks (P. 40) attacked therailway bridge at Puchi and 50 troop barges and two gun-boats between Shasiand Yochow. Other Kittyhawks attacked warehouses, barracks and a camp nearLungling in the Province of Yunnan.Nine enemy bombers and 17 fighters attacked Kiehsow airfield (340 miles.S.E. of Nanking), scoring hits on the runway.In French Indo-China six escorted Mitchells (B. 25) dropped eight tons of bombs on Hongay (90 miles E. of Hanoi); locomotives, a transformer station anda railway repair shed were hit. Road and rail transport near Hanoi was successfully attacked by Kittyhawks (P. 40).Pacific Zone.New Guinea.44. Enemy airfields were again successfully attacked, also the seaplanebase at Babo. Attacks were also made on enemy positions and communications in the Lae, Salamoa, Babo and Komiatum areas.A 3,000-ton ship was damaged in Kokas Harbour, a small ship was probably sunk in Humboldt Bay and several barges were destroyed or damaged offFinschhafen and the Huon Peninsula.New Britain.Heavy bombers made several attacks on airfields and landing grounds nearRabaul, causing many fires among buildings and aircraft. Gasmata airfield wasalso attacked.Solomon Islands.The airfields at Munda (New Georgia) and at Kahili and Ballale (Bougain-ville Island) were attacked by heavy bombers. A medium size ship was damagedoff Buka.Allied fighters, which intercepted 45 Japanese aircraft off Russell Island,destroyed 25 for the loss of six (four pilots safe).Timor.Heavy and medium bombers attacked Koepang and the airfields at Dilli andPenfoei. At Koepang, a power house was destroyed and fires started in the fuel dumps. A 5,00O-ton ship in Waingapoe Harbour (Sumba Island) was damaged.Aru Islands.Seven Beaufighters attacked the seaplane base at Taberfane (25 miles S. ofDobo) destroying seven float planes and damaging two others.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.45.   Enemy attacks on this country have occurred on four nights.On the 12th/13th Plymouth was attacked; 53 fires were started, and adistillery and a gas-holder were burnt out. Considerable damage was done to house property. Incidents also occurred in the London area at East and West[25588] ; - .l&apos; t$y c
Ham; at the latter place a 20-pump fire involved a truck of oil and other rolling-stock.On the 13th/14th, Grimsby and Cleethorpes were bombed, a large number ofincendiaries and anti-personnel bombs being used. At Grimsby serious damage was done to a transport depot; 70 houses were badly damaged, and some damage was done to the L.N.E.R. car sheds. Ail railway traffic to Cleethorpes was stopped and there was considerable damage to property in the town. In bothplaces together there were 126 fires, 2 of which were serious.On the 14th/ 15th bombs dropped at Ealing caused some damage and casualties. On the 15th/16th bombs were dropped at Ramsgate, causing a briefinterruption of the electric light supply in that town. Minor incidents alsooccurred at Margate and Broadstairs.Casualties.46. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours onthe 16th were 101 killed and 191 seriously injured; of these there were 65 killed and 110 seriously injured at Grimsby on the night of the 13th/14th.
Appendices I, II, III and IY will be published periodically.APPENDIX Y.Casualties to H.M. Auxiliary Vessels and Naval Personnel.The following casualties to naval personnel have been reported: Officers : 11 killed; 3 wounded; 9 (including 2 prisoners of war) killed,previously reported missing.Ratings: 9 killed; 4 missing; 4 wounded.APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have.been received during the week : Germany.Dortmund. A final interpretation of photographs covering most of the townand suburbs shows that in Hoesch A.G., although only two-thirds of the works have been covered, 22 buildings have been destroyed and 22 others damaged, 11buildings in the Vereinigte Stahlwerke (Dortmund Union) have been damaged.Amongst other works more or less severely affeGted are three other branches ofHoesch A.G., C. H. Jucho (constructional engineers), E. Willmann (boiler works),Eisenwerk Rothe Erde (ironworks) and Both u. Tillmann G.m.b.H. (railway wagons). Five breweries and many dock and railway warehouses have also been damaged. The main railway station has received further severe damage, and goods sheds, repair shops, rolling stock and tracks in four other stations havebeen hit. Fifty-three workers&apos; huts have been destroyed by fire and H.E.Amongst public utilities and buildings hit are the municipal power station, the gas works, the municipal car park, a telegraph office and the main fire station. -Damage to business and, residential property has been especially heavy inthe central area of the town, where at least 115 acres have been devastated, mainly by fire. Some. 880 buildings and at least 1,250 houses have been destroyed orseverely damaged.The town itself was not affected by the floods. In the Hoesch Works finishedparts, awaiting despatch, for 30 tanks of the latest type (stated to be over50 tons) were severely damaged.. Since the 27th May, travel to and fromDortmund has been suspended, save for those with a special permit and it isexpected that this prohibition will last until the 1st July.In the attack on the 4th/5th May the destruction of signal boxes and railway lines at the main station prevented any train leaving on the following day. Twotrains present, at the time of the attack were burnt out. Both of the station air raid shelters were hit and casualties were severe.Kiel. A detailed interpretation of photographs taken between the 14thand 20th May shows that in the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 14th May the 1,600-tonU-boat on the open slips in the Germania Yards was severely damaged.The smoke screen and bomb bursts on the photographs taken during the attack prevented an exact analysis of the U-boats present at the fitting-out jetties,but a close examination indicates that at least one U-boat niust have been hit.
The presence of special salvage craft at these jetties on the 19th and 20th Maysuggests that one or more U-boats were sunk.In the Deutsche Werke there were three 500-ton U-boats and one broacl-bearned U-boat fitting out at the north-west and south-west quays of the innerdockyard basin at the time of the attack, and photographs taken during the raidshowed two bombs bursting apparently on one of the 500-ton U-boats. On the19th May photographs show two salvage vessels in place of one of the 500-tonU-boats, &quot;of which there is no sign, and there are grounds for belief that this vessel was also sunk.Flensburg. In the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 19th May direct hits were obtained on the electricity works, three barracks and two battery positions, whiletwo barrage balloons were shot down.
