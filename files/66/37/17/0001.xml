THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-  Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.SECRET. Copy No. 24W.P. (43) 217.May 25, 1943. - .TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.ARMISTICES AND RELATED PROBLEMS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Cabinet still have before them W.P. (43) 31, covering a paper entitled the United Nations Plan.&quot; I have not as yet asked my colleagues to take any decision on this paper, which was circulated to them as a first indication ofthe way my mind was working after consulting certain members of the cabinet who had valuable suggestions to make. As a result of my conversations in washington and Ottawa, however, it seems likely that the paper will have to be substantially revised, and discussions are now taking place on an official levelbetween my Department and the Dominions Office on the question how best an approach to the Dominions (which is obviously the first step) should eventually be made.2. In the meantime, I am becoming increasingly impressed by the importanceof defining our own views oh what I would broadly call &apos;&apos; Armistices and relatedproblems,&quot; and with the need for conveying these views to the Russians and the americans, and, after obtaining their agreement, to the minor Allies.3. It is now time to consider what form an eventual armistice with germany should take, and what the means of giving effect to it should be. We should decide, too, what system would, from our point of view, be best for co-ordinating the activities of the United Nations authorities, military and civil, and for maintaining order in Europe generally in the period immediately following theend of hostilities. On this subject there has already been an informal exchangeof views between Foreign Office officials and their American opposite numbers(see the attached memoranda). What is now required is some definite statementof the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government which could, be communicated notonly to the Americans but to the Russians as well. It is evident that agreementbetween the three major Allies is essential if confusion is to be avoided. More-over, such agreement, if reached, would go a long way towards preserving the unity of the United Nations and laying the foundations for any future WorldOrder that may be established. It follows that we should go slow with discussions of a rather theoretical nature on the most desirable substitute for the old Leagueof Nations, and proceed with strict reference to certain practical problems, asolution of which cannot in any circumstances be unduly delayed. By such meansit is more likely that we shall be able to establish real co-operation between ourselves, the Americans and the Russians. In this way they might even bydegrees be induced to undertake obligations which they would otherwise be unwilling to accept.  .4.   I would accordingly ask my colleagues to agree to the following principles governing our approach to &quot;Armistices and related problems&quot; and to the eventual12043   [25491j    &apos; b
communication of a memorandum embodying them to the United States and theSoviet Governments. Such a communication might well be made both throughthe diplomatic and the military channel: (A) The terms to be imposed on any European member of the Axis should be presented as one comprehensive document covering all the united nations at war with that member, and embodying the principle ofunconditional surrender.(B) If there exists a central enemy Government with which we are preparedto treat, a fully accredited representative of that Government shouldbe associated with its Commander-in-Chief for purposes of signature;or alternatively the Armistice should not come into force untilconfirmed by that Government.(C) If there is no such Government the Armistice should be signed by theenemy Commander-in-Chief only. In that case provisions Avhich theenemy Commander-in-Chief lacks authority to execute would have tobe omitted from the Armistice, which would thus be primarily amilitary document. Non-military provisions should so far as necessary be embodied in a Declaration or Proclamation issued bythe United Nations.(D) If there is neither an enemy Government nor Commander-in-Chief with whom we can or are prepared to treat, military resistance would presumably be brought to an end by a series of local capitulations.It would, however, probably be desirable that the United nations should issue a Declaration stating their intentions in respect of thedefeated Power. This would be followed by a series of Proclamationsissued by the Allied Commander-in-Chief containing instructions tothe local authorities and population.(E) The&apos; administration of any Armistice should be placed in the hands of. an Inter-Allied Armistice Commission, the President to be alternatelyrepresentative of the United States, U.S.S.R. - and the UnitedKingdom. The Commission would establish its headquarters in the axis country concerned, and would be responsible for controlling theexecution of the Armistice terms; in the first place, the disarmament and demobilisation of enemy armed forces, the collection and disposalof surrendered war material and other mobile property and the handing over of fortifications and other fixed property. Repre-sentatives of the Armistice Commission , would be despatched toliberated Allied territory to perform a similar task in respect of theenemy troops there located and to regulate their evacuation orinternment.(F) In the absence of an Armistice (see paragraph  (D)), a  control commission should administer the appropriate portions of theDeclaration.(G) Any Armistice or Declaration would presumably provide for theoccupation, whether total or partial, of the country concerned.Germany, in any case, should be totally occupied, and might be dividedinto three main zones, convenient for administration by ourselves,United States and U.S.S.R. In these zones the occupying forces would be predominantly British, United States and Russian respec-tively, but would in each case include forces of the other Allies andbe under Inter-Allied Command. The principle of a joint united nations occupation would then be maintained, but problems of supplyand administration would be simplified.(H) The United Nations Commander-in-Chief in any occupied country should have complete responsibility for the maintenance of law andorder.(J) There should be established a supervisory body entitled &quot; United nations commission for Europe,&quot; composed of high-ranking political repre-sentatives of the three major Allies, of France and the minorEuropean Allies, and possibly of any Dominion prepared to contribute to the policing of Europe. The &quot;Commission should be situated at someconvenient point on the Continent.The Commission would act as the supreme United Nationsauthority in Europe to direct and co-ordinate the activities of theseveral Armistice Commissions, the Allied Commanders-in-Chief andany United Nations civilian authorities that may be established; andto deal with current problems, military, political, and economic,connected with the maintenance of order.
A &quot; Steering Committee,&quot; consisting of the representatives ofthe three major Allies and of France, if she recovers her greatness,,should be established as the directing body of the Commission. In the&quot; Steering Committee &quot; the unanimity rule should apply.(K) It is likely that a number of civilian authorities will be set up by agree-ment between the United Nations^ some on a world and others on a european basis. Apart from the United Nations Relief and Rehabib-tation Administration and the Inter-governmental Committee whichmay emerge from the Bermuda Conference, the establishment of a. United Nations Shipping Authority and a United NationsInland Transport Authority for Europe have been suggested.Analogous bodies may well be required to control telecommuncations and propoganda, and to handle reparation and restitution and othereconomic problems. These authorities might, in respect of theirEuropean activities, establish their headquarters in the same city asthe United Nations Commission for Europe, to whom they would be**responsible and provide the necessary technical advice.5. It seems that, unless we are to contemplate the signature by the soviet union of a separate armistice and the creation of a situation in which russia would organise an independent system of her own in Eastern Europe, the aboveprinciples are a prerequisite of any concerted effort to cope with the chaoticsituation which will follow the collapse of the Axis in Europe. Even though itmay seem that we are aiming high in trying to get the Russians and the americans to agree to them, I am certain that the effort must be made, and, further, that itshould be made in the fairly near future.- 6. As will be seen from the attached record of conversations between officials in Washington there seems reason to suppose that Americans for their part would, welcome some system based on the principles which I have outlined.I would certainly not despair of eventually getting Russian agreement to them also, r/political considerations will, of course, always be present in the Russianmind. It may not be. easy to arrive at agreement with them in advance as to,e.g\, the future of Germany. On&apos;the other hand, the method of approach whichI have suggested has the merit of not raising such awkward problems as these,and of concentrating simply on the establishment of the machinery which wouldseem to be necessary, whatever policy is pursued, provided only that the necessityfor Great Power collaboration is admitted. It may be, of course, that the Sovietwill refuse to discuss even these matters at present, and even eventually go theirown way in Europe without regard for our wishes or those of the Americans.But I cannot see that we shall lose anything by at least suggesting to them acontrary course.7. There is also this wider consideration. Unless we can harmonise the policies of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States, andprobably unless we can get some machinery established, to ensure such harmony,no settlement of any kind is possible. In that case we should have very shortly!after the conclusion of this war, to set about preparing for the next. I suggest tomy colleagues that the most likely way to effect such harmony is by the constitutionof some body such as the United Nations Commission for Europe, and I would ask them to bear these wider considerations in mind when considerino- theproposals which I have made.A. E.Foreign Office, May 25, 1943.Annex.I discussions with the United States Administration on Armistice Problems.(Secret.)Mr. STRANG and I saw Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ray Atherton this morning inthe State Department.2. After some other business had been disposed of, Mr. Strang asked me totell the meeting what our organisation was in London for the consideration of&quot; Armistice &quot; problems-and how it worked. This I proceeded to do, and at theend of my remarks we handed to our American colleagues two papers by ProfessorWebster, the first on Procedural Problems and the other on the moral to be drawn[25491] ; &apos; b 2
from what happened at the end of the last war. We made it clear that these werenot official expressions of opinion. Mr. Dunn expressed great satisfaction on receiving these papers and promised to read them and to show them to Mr. Norman3. A discussion then followed on the sort of problems which would arise onthe termination of hostilities in Europe and on,the sort of machinery which we ought to create for the purpose of studying them. There was general agreement that an effort should at some stage be made to bring the Russians into the discus-sions, and that the only real hope for establishing order in Europe immediatelyafter the war would lie in three-Power collaboration, subject to the proviso that, if France recovered her strength, she might be associated with the three Powers on abasis of equality.4. Mr. Strang and I then sketched out the conception of a United nations commission for Europe, which might in the first instance co-ordinate the activitiesof the various armistice commissions. It seemed to us that three-Power action inthe war would lead necessarily to three-Power concern with the terms of capitula-tion, and this in turn to three-Power collaboration in the re-establishment of order after the cessation of hostilities. Our American colleagues showed great interest in this idea, and seemed to attach particular importance to the suggestionthat problems of, for example, European transport as a whole could only be satisfactorily handled if some such organ were established. It was further suggested that the minor European Allies would have to be associated with thecommission, though they would not actually be full members of it in the same way as the three (or four) Powers- would be.5. Mr. Dunn (speaking off the record) said that it was, in his view, essential for some machine to establish order being set up fairly soon after hostilitiesceased : otherwise there would be a danger of the Americans getting the impression that Europe was hopeless and pulling out altogether.6. Finally, Mr. Strang said that we had reached a stage in our studies ofthe military aspects of armistice problems when we thought some exchange ofideas with the Americans would be useful. If the United States authoritiesagreed, the next step might be for Admiral Bellairs to come out to washington in order to exchange notes with his American opposite numbers. It was agreedthat this suggestion should be conveyed to Mr. Norman Davis, who would makethe necessary enquiries.7. The whole conversation was entirely unofficial and exploratory, andMr. Dunn said that, up to the present at any rate, the State Department had notbeen very closely associated with the Security Sub-Committee, which, under thechairmanship of Mr. Norman Davis, had been working on a report on&quot; Armistice &quot; problems. He hoped, however, that progress on the Americanside would now be more rapid. We shall try to find out more about the actualactivities of this committee at ,our next meeting.Mr. STRANG and I saw Mr. Norman Davis and Mr. Dunn this afternoon in order to follow up our preliminary talk with Mr. Dunn and Mr. Athertonyesterday. Mr. Norman Davis, who did nearly all the talking, gave expression to the following views : 1. Armaments and Disarmament. -It seems that the American authorities have considered these questions ina preliminary way,- but have&apos;not yet made up their minds. Mr. Davis said thathe personally was not sure that the Presidents idea of denying any arms tothe minor Allies was practicable. On the contrary, the smaller Allies ought insome way to contribute physically. to some general or regional security system.It would, of course, be desirable for them not to exhaust their exiguous resourcesimmediately after the war in piling up armaments, but it was fairly evidentthat if they had none, whereas the major Allies continued to be heavily armed,they would eventually be in a favoured position, at any rate economically. Inany case, some scheme for the regulation of armaments after the war was essential, and the Americans had been toying with a scheme whereby all powers should have enough for internal police purposes, and over and above that should contribute on an agreed scale towards some internationally regulated policingDavis beforGLADWYN JEBB.March 24, 1943.(Secret.)
system. He agreed with us in thinking that it was to the interest of GreatBritain and the United States that France should be strong.With regard to disarmament, it was common ground that the enemy powers should be completely and finally disarmed; the only question was how these provisions were to be enforced. Mr. Davis expressed the view that inspection of factories should not be very difficult, nor would a very complicated system for achieving it be necessary, provided only that the United Nations and moreparticularly the three Great Powers were in a position to insist on inspectionsof any particular factory and have the force available for overcoming anyresistances.    . &apos;2. The Dismemberment of Germany.Mr. Davis said that although he knew that the President favoureddismemberment and that this idea found favour in various high quarters elsewhere,Mr. Hull had not made up his mind about it, and the American Chiefs of staffs and incidentally he, himself, were by no means convinced that it would be goodpolicy. They took the view that an enforced dismemberment would be likely in the long run to encourage centripetal tendencies and might increase ratherthan diminish the danger of the re-cmergence of an unified and bellicose Reich.This was not to say that people who thought like this on the Americanside would be against encouraging particularist or, indeed, separatist-tendencies, if these manifested themselves at the end of the war; but it wouldbe preferable, he thought, for us to try to convince the Germans that they wouldbe really better off in some rather loosely united confederation than as part ofa Nazi unitary State.3. Occupation of Germany.Mr. Davis said that he, himself, had until recently been rather attracted by the idea of the three major Allies each occupying separate areas, but thatGeneral Strong had argued powerfully in favour of a &quot;mixing up&quot; of theAllied ^occupying forces. Thus, the Russian, American and British wouldoccupy strategic points all over Germany. They would hot (we understoodMr. Davis to say) actually be in the same towns; but there would be no specificarea allotted to any one Power. The idea- had not yet been fully worked out and it obviously would present certain administrative difficulties; but it was thought, on the American side, that the allotment of large areas to any onePower could only result in the creation of zones of influence and that this, inthe long run, would not promote harmony between the Big Three. Moreover,it was likely that the Russians would treat the Germans far more brutally thaneither the Americans or the English. This would, in itself, probably give riseto difficulties and a more unified policy in regard to the treatment of the popula-tion might be possible if the &apos;&apos; mixing up &apos;&apos; theory were adopted than if thecontrary system were applied.4. United Nations Commission for Armistice and P&apos;ost-Armistice Problems inEurope.Mr. Dunn asked me to develop this idea, which I did on the lines of myrecord of yesterday&apos;s meeting, saying it was of course only an idea we werethrowing into the pool, and not an official proposal. The idea seemed to be a newone to Mr. Davis, but he reacted quite favourably, more especially when it was explained that the members of this commission would probably be civilians andnot soldiers. He said frankly that there was in Washington and he thought there was quite likely with us some division of opinion as to the extent to whichthe military should be responsible for the administration of occupied enemy areas,and I here made some allusion to the problem of the relations between thecommander-in-chief and the armistice commissions, and between both of themand any United Nations body that might be established. He. knew thatMr. Sumner Welles had ideas for dealing with the political aspect of militaryoperations. It was at this point, if I remember correctly, that Mr. Davis said he thought it was of the highest importance that ideas should be exchanged between us before schemes crystallised on either side.5. Proposed Visit of Admiral Bellairs.Mr. Dunn referred to this question, and Mr. Strang said that it had beensuggested to us that the admiral might come here in&apos; the near future to confer with the American military authorities on purely technical, as opposed to
political, matters connected with the termination of hostilities, if the Americansthought the moment was ripe. Mr. Davis said that he would certainly confer with General Strong and let us know what he thought. He could see that the visit might well be useful, and he was only worried lest the Russians should get it into their heads that we were fixing things up behind their backs. Mr. Strangsaid that we saw the force of this, and that he would consult the Secretary ofState; but it was agreed that, if the admiral did come, it ought to be possible toavoid any rumour of his mission getting around to the Soviet Government.Mr. Davis said that he supposed that the admiral could not speak for the army,but we told him that he would be able to represent the military sub-committee as a whole, and consequently all three services.6. Collaboration with Russia.Mr. Davis said that he knew there was a general assumption that we shouldcontinue to be friends with the Soviets, and that our relations would be increasingly warm. He personally always has had some doubt about this, but heentirely agreed that the greatest possible efforts should be made to bring Russiainto the peace and to work out arrangements with her in advance. He seemed tothink, however, that Russia would be determined to build a large navy, and thatwe would have difficulties with her in that respect. He agreed with the theorythat the Soviet Government had not, as yet, made up their mind on the exactpolicy which they would pursue after the war, and that it might be that, if weshowed that we had confidence in them now, they would generally wish to&quot;co-operate. On the other hand, if they did not decide on co-operation there was little doubt but that they could play old Harry with their Communist propaganda.The right course, he thought, was to talk very straight with Stalin, whoappreciated the direct method. In any case, the United States was certainly not going to war with Russia for the Baltic States or indeed for any frontiers in eastern Europe.The whole interview was entirely informal, and both sides stated franklythat they had no authority for any of the views expressed. Mr. Davis recognisedthat the Foreign Secretary might shortly have another interview with  hePresident, at which unity of views on the highest political matters might be forthcoming; but he said that his latest information was that the President was again inclined to the side of caution, and that possibly he. would not want to gomuch further than he had already gone before the Foreign Secretary left.Already there were signs of a pretty vigorous reaction on the part of the smallerPowers against what was referred to as &quot; four Power dictation &apos;&apos; (Mr. Dunn heredrew attention to M. van Kleffens&apos;s recent letter to The Times), and it might bethat in view of this the President might prefer to &quot;let things grow&quot; ratherthan come out with any cut-and-dried scheme.GLADWYN JEBB.March 25, 1943.
