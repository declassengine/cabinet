aIDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.MOST SECRET.Copy No. ti oW.P. (43) 210.May 17, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.GOVERNMENT BUILDING PROGRAMME FOR PERIOD APRIL to september, 1943.THE Minister of Production^ proposal in W.P. (43) 196 involves a loss of nearly 100,000 man months in the building programme of the Air Ministry.2.   This programme and the labour force to complete it have successfullysurvived the exhaustive reviews of recent months.3. The Minister of Production in W.P. (43) 68 reported that all the airfieldsnow under construction would be needed to meet the expansion of the Royal AirForce and the increasing movements of the U.S.A.A.F. units to this country.Subsequent developments have not diminished this need. The item then out-standing, eight new airfields, .was subsequently approved by the DefenceCommittee (Supply).4. It has been accepted that the labour force is planned on most economicallines. It is already severely limited in size in view of the general labour difficulties. A continuance of good fortune and the satisfaction of our require-ments in regard to the distribution of labour will be needed to complete thephased programme in time.5. Disregarding adverse effects after September next, the result of theproposed cut would be to delay from September to November the completion of34 new bomber stations 19 British and 15 American and of essential extensions to 36 bomber stations-23 British and 13 American. Accommodation would be -lacking in September for 50 R.A.F. bomber squadrons, and for 20 AmericanGroups. In addition, essential projects in Fighter, Coastal, Flying Training,Transport and Maintenance Commands would also be seriously delayed.6. The proposals could not be implemented without grave consequences,more especially to the Anglo-American bomber offensive which, under. agreed policy, takes equal priority with the development of operations in the Mediter-ranean theatre.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry,May 17, 1943.
