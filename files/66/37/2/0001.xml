One gunboatand one transport were probably sunk, and one cargo ship was damaged.Anti-Submarine Operations.6.- During the week 73 attacks on U-boats have been reported : 41 by aircraft, one by a submarine, and the remainder by ships. &apos;Seven U-boats have been sunk, five probably sunk, five probably damaged and one possibly damaged.
On the 4th H.M. Trawler Cbverley struck a submerged object west of cape finisterre. Later some survivors were rescued, and it is considered that aU-boat was sunk.During the night of the 5th /6th 24 attacks by U-boats were made on a convoy400 miles east of Belle Isle. All the attacks were repulsed and six successfulcounter-attacks were carried out : H.M. Ships Oribi (destroyer) and Sunflower(corvette) each rammed a U-boat, Snow flake (corvette) claimed to have destroyedone with depth-charges, Loosestrife (corvette) depth-charged another which blewup, and Vidette (destroyer) damaged another. Pelican (sloop), one of the supportgroup, probably destrojred a U-bo.at. A full report is awaited, but. meanwhile,the attacks are considered to have resulted in three U-boats being sunk and threeprobably sunk.On&quot; the 11th H.M. Ships Fleetwood (sloop) and Mignonette (corvette) sank a U-boat&apos;which had previously been attacked by aircraft north-west of cape finisterre.   Forty-five prisoners were captured.During the night of the llth/12th two U-boats were sunk by H.M.S. ^Hesperus (destroyer) and the escorts of a homebound convoy north-west of the azores.   On the next day the escorts of another homebound convoy probably sank a U-boat north-east of the Azores.  A Liberator-(B. 24) probably damaged another in the same position.A Liberator (B. 24) probably sank a U-boat in mid-Atlantic on the 4th.Two U-boats were probably damaged by aircraft in the S.W. Approaches, andUS. aircraft probably damaged two others in the N.W. Approaches&apos;. H.M.S.Jonquil (corvette) may have damaged a U-boat west of Finisterre on the 4th.Enemy Intelligence.German:7. On the 10th a Russian photographic reconnaissance of Alten Fjordshowed one large ship, -presumably &apos;Scharnhorst, lutzow, and four destroyerspresent. A large ship, possibly Tirpitz, was seen in Lang Fjord but notphotographed.Italian.8. The 6&quot; cruisers Garibaldi and Abruzzi have arrived at Genoa fromTaranto. One of the two 6&quot; cruisers Montecuccoli and Eugenio Di Savoiawhich had been repairing at Genoa is now at Spezia. A new &quot; Regolo &quot; classcruiser was seen at Taranto on the 8th.It is estimated that, during the last days of the enemy occupation of Tunisianharbours, 4,500 tons of shipping arrived in convoy.Between 200 and 250 caiques of over 100 tons are estimated to be operating in the ,/aegean on behalf of the enemy. Between 10,000 and 15,000 tons ofsupplies are carried each month by these craft.J apanese.9. On the 3rd 11 ships and one destroyer were sighted in the Buin area.On the 8th a convoy of four merchant ships, escorted by a light cruiser and two destroyers, was sighted en route&quot; to Rabaul.  &apos; . &apos;The heavy cruiser of the &apos;&apos; Aoba &apos;&apos; class, which was recently damaged by aircraft at Kavieng, may have been towed to Truk.- *U-boats.10. Over 120 U-boats are estimated to be operating in the Atlantic. Thisis the largest number so far reported.About 14 of the 1,600-ton supply U-boats built at Kiel are now completed;these carry fuel, 30/40 tons of general stores, and a small number of torpedoes.&apos;About 20 of the 1,000/1,200-ton long-range U-boats built at Bremen are considered to have been completed.On the 10th it was estimated that the disposition of Japanese U-boats was approximately as follows: one in S.W. Pacific, three off the east coast ofAustralia, six in the New Britain area, one in the Solomons area, one in. theS. Pacific, probably two between the Friendly Islands and Fiji, and one in theNew Hebrides.[25432] - &apos;        B.
Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending midnight the 9th 903 ships were convoyed.Of these, 201 were in ocean convoys and 702 in British coastal, convoys.Seventy destroyers (including seven U.S. destroyers), 127 sloops, cutters,corvettes and frigates (including three U.S. cutters), one escort carrier, one oceanboarding vessel and one anti-aircraft ship were employed on escort duties.   &apos;During the week 98 ships in three convoys arrived in Home Waters without loss.12. During the week ending the 8th, imports into the United Kingdom in ships in convoy totalled 669,000 tons compared with 337,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 690,600 tons during the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports 264,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.13. During April, ten inward ocean convoys, of 234 ships arrived without loss, and six, originally of 283 ships, lost 16 ships before arrival, four of themstragglers. Nine outward ocean convoys of 182 ships reached their destinationwithout loss, and four, originally of 137 ships, lost six ships, including onestraggler. In addition, two outward convoys still at sea at the end of the monthhad each lost one ship.In the West Atlantic and Caribbean 134 convoys, comprising 1,764 ships,were escorted without loss.fEnemy Attack on Shipping.14. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked nine ships,of which five are known to have sunk.Two ships in a homebound Atlantic convoy were sunk and two stragglersfrom another homebound convoy were torpedoed north of the Azores. One ship in a homebound convoy from Freetown was sunk south-west of Cape Finisterre.One ship was sunk and another torpedoed south-east of Freetown. One ship was sunk south of Durban and another torpedoed west of Ceylon.Aircraft damaged a ship in a raid on Murmansk.Three ships were damaged in Gibraltar Bay by external explosions. Subse-quent examination by divers revealed clamped bombs, and human torpedo gearhas been recovered in the vicinity.15. Shipping losses from enemy action during April, as recorded to date,amounted to 313,000 tons, which was less than half the total for March. U-boatscaused the loss of 300,000 tons, of which 215,000 tons occurred in the north atlantic. Losses caused by Japanese U-boats in the Pacific and Indian Oceanamounted to 67,000 tons.Losses due to aircraft, mines and surface craft, amounted to only 10,000 tonsFive tankers, totalling 39,000 tons, three of which were British and two U.S.,were lost during the month.British minelaying.16. During the week mines were laid by surface craft in Northern Waters,and by aircraft off the German North Sea coast and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy minelaying, British Minesweeping.17. minelaying by aircraft took place on one night of the week betweenHarwich and Flamborough Head. E-boats were operating off the South Coaston the night of the 5th/6th.Sixteen mines have been destroyed in the approaches to Bizerta.The enemy is reported to have laid mines in the Grecian Archipelago.The mine totals are : 4,287 ground and 2,484 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.18. Eleven arrivals and 14 sailings of ore ships have been reported fromBilbao during the week.It is reported that the German-controlled Norwegian s.s. Trondhjejnsfjord(6,753 tons) has recently been sunk in the Skagerrak. The Italian s.s. Mauro Croce(1,049 tons), recently damaged by one of our submarines off Valencia, arrived atBarcelona on the 8th. .-:The Italian s.s. Alba Julia (5,701 tons) sailed from Istanbul on the 4th, andentered the iEgean the next day.   The Italian tanker Celeno (3,741&apos; tons) arrived
at Istanbul on the 6th, and left the same day for Constanza to load for the^aegean. The Bulgarian ships Balkan (3,838 tons) and Bourgas (2,940 tons) alsoarrived at Istanbul on the 6th. The former, which had come from the Piraeus,left again the same day for Panderma, where she will load chrome, after which she is expected to sail direct for Burghaz; the latter left the same day forBurghaz.19. During the period the 1st to 15th April 25 enemy ships of 68,853 tons were sunk, captured, or became constructive total losses, eight ships of 23,600 tons were seriously damaged, and a further 14 ships of 48,788 tons were damaged.Of these 17 ships of 36,458 tons were sunk and six of 22,000 tons were seriously damaged in the Mediterranean. The total number of enemy merchant ships which have been sunk, captured, or become, constructive total losses since thebeginning of the war is 1,501 ships of 5,266,716 tons, of which 650 ships, of2,135,325 tons, have been casualties in the Mediterranean.20. It is estimated that during the period June 1942 to the 15th April,1943, blockade runners from the Far East have probably delivered approximately the following cargoes in ports in German-occupied Europe: 16,000 tons of rubber, 10,000 tons of vegetable oils and animal fats, 1,000 tons of tin, 1,500 tonsof tea, and 100 tons of tungsten. Some of these goods were probably destined for italy. Cargoes lost are estimated at 29,000 tons of rubber, 20,000 tons ofvegetable oils and fats, at least 6,500 tons of tin, 250 tons of tea, 200 tons oftungsten, 40 tons of quinine extract, and 30 tons of quinine bark. If these estimates are correct Germany and Italy have obtained less than one-third of the vital raw material for which they had been hoping.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map of the Tunis area is included as an inset).Tunisia.21. The outstanding event in this period is the advance of the British forceseastwards from Medjez El Bab via Tunis to Hammamet and the correspondingadvance of U.S. forces in the north upon Bizerta, which have culminated in theend of organised enemy resistance in North Africa. On the evening of the5th, preceded by very heavy intense aerial bombardment, our forces attackedDjebel Bou Aoukaz feature which commands the Medjerda valley on the southernside. By last light all objectives on.this key hill had been secured. This featurewas the hinge to the doorway through which early the following morning FirstArmy&apos;s attack was launched.22. The 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Indian Division from the eighth Army, together with the 201 Guards Motor Brigade, had been switchedfrom the east to add more weight to the thrust in the Medjez sector. At0300 hours on the 6th these forces, together with those already in the area,attacked north-eastwards in the general direction of the Medjez El Bab-Tunisroad. By 1100 hours first infantry objectives had been secured, and the village of Frendj was reported clear. Two armoured divisions were then passed throughthe infantry, and by-passing the Furna area, which was later cleared up by the infantry, reached Massicault by 1800 hours. By 0830 hours the following morningSt. Cyprien had fallen and by 1540 hours armoured cars from the two armoured divisions were entering Tunis. This marked an advance of 30 miles in .36 hours a veritable thunderbolt. The attack was supported by what has been officiallydescribed as the heaviest air offensive of the war, as well as an. exceptionally heavy artillery bombardment. On the 8th one of the armoured divisions waspassed to the south-east and the other to the north of Tunis. The former was engaged all day in the Hammam Lif area, where the enemy rearguard foughthard to protect their lines of retreat into the Cap Bon Peninsula. By the 10th,however, enemy resistance appeared to be disintegrating on this front and by1700 hours on that day Grombalia was in our hands, Hammam Lif, Cretevilleand Soliman having fallen. To the north and north-west of Tunis mopping uphad continued. In Tunis itself all fighting ceased on the morning of the 8thand the Tricolour was raised by a French regiment, who also took over the policing-of the city. During the 11th there was a further deterioration in the enemy&apos;position and a tendency to surrender in groups became more pronounced.Reconnaissance and other mobile units made the circuit of the Cap Bon Peninsulaby way of the coastal road.   An Italian armoured division surrendered en bloc[254321 - . . b 2
during the morning, and on the following day General Von Arnim himself was captured. Further south our leading armoured forces reached Bou Ficha, someeight miles from the Eighth Army, along the coastal road, and on the following-day contact was formally established between the two armies. With the completeencirclement of the remaining Axis forces organised enemy resistance was broken down and only scattered bodies were holding out in the hills.23. In the north, the 2nd U.S. Corps had met with similar success.Throughout the 6th and 7th the advance along the north and south shores of lake Achkel had continued when many prisoners were captured. The advance was continued further south, east and south-east of Mateur. On the 7thFerryville was captured, and later that same afternoon Bizerta fell. Throughoutthe 8th the clearing up of the peninsula south-east of Bizerta went forward untilthe 9th, when the German General Krause unconditionally surrendered all german forces in the area between Bizerta Lake and Porto Farino. Fighting inthe Bizerta Peninsula ceased at 1100 hours. Formations which surrenderedincluded the 15th and elements of the 10th German Panzer Divisions, and tworegiments of artillery. By the 11th, 37,998 prisoners, of whom 34,498 areGermans, had been checked through U.S. cages.24. In the French sector, west of the Eighth Army, the French troopscontinued their advance and. occupied Pont Du Fahs on the 7th. The following day a French armoured group advanced through heavy opposition to takeZaghouan, but resistance continued in the neighbourhood of the town up to the11th, when the German Commander in that area surrendered unconditionally tothe French Commander. This surrender marked the end.of organised resistance in this sector and by nightfall a further 25,000 prisoners had been captured anda general advance in a north-easterly direction was made.25. The Eighth Army have conducted only limited operations during theperiod under review, the ground on this front being extensively mined. However,owing to the general disintegration of the enemy forces to the north and to thewest &quot;organised resistance has ceased over the greater part of the Eighth Army&apos;sfront and only pockets of resistance remain to be cleared.26. Prisoners are expected to exceed substantially the present figure of120,000, and captures of guns, tanks and all forms of M.T. have been veryconsiderable.The Russo-German Campaign.27. Apart from small local attacks, particularly by the Germans in theLisichansk area, fighting has again been confined to the Taman Peninsula.Since the capture of Krimskaya, the Russians have continued to attackstrongly against the northern front of the bridgehead and from Krimskayasouth-westwards towards Novorossisk. The Germans offered stubborn resistanceand made numerous counter-attacks, but the Russians have nevertheless made some progress, and have inflicted heavy casualties on the defending german forces.Burma.Arakan Front.28. During the past week Japanese activity has increased east of the MayuRange. Attacks in the Buthidaung area forced our troops to withdraw and theenemy are now firmly esconced in Buthidaung. In the centre sector enemy thrustswere directed against the Buthidaung-Maungdaw road. Here, again, in spiteof counter-attacks, the Japanese have succeeded in cutting the road near Letwedet.West of the Mayu Hills operations have -been confined to patrol activity, andthere is little change in dispositions.Upper Burma.29.   There has been skirmishing round Sumprabum where the Japanese have suffered some casualties.South-West Pacific.- 30.   Australian patrols are, operating within three miles of Salamaua.   In ja series of ambushes they have inflicted considerable casualties on the Japanesewhile suffering negligible casualties themselves.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.31. On the Western Front, bad weather prevailed until the last night of theweek, when Duisburg was successfully attacked with a heavy weight of bombs.Allied aircraft gave full support to our land forces in Tunisia and madeheavy attacks on Pantelleria and on harbours and airfields in Sicily.United Kingdom.32. During daylight, a total of 71 enemy aircraft carried out attacks with bombs and machine guns, mainly on two East Anglian ports. On one night, eightaircraft operated over scattered districts of Southern England and, on another,six aircraft raided a coastal area in Suffolk. Anti-aircraft fire destroyed three,four others were destroyed by causes which are not established and fighters sho?down two more, one of which was intercepted over its own airfield in France.Coastal Operations.33. Mustangs (P. 51) of Army Co-operation Command, damaged threeflakships off Texel. and an armed trawler off the Hook. Spitfires (one is missing)damaged a probable minesweeper, off Ushant.Nineteen aircraft of Bomber Command laid 62 sea-mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.34. Mustangs (P. 51) of Army Co-operation Command and Spitfires of fighter Command damaged 16 locomotives, nine goods trains and four aircraft on the ground during offensive operations over Northern France.Night.35. Activity against land targets was restricted by unfavourable weatherto one large-scale attack on the night of the 12th/13th. The target was Duisburg.A total of 1,559 tons of H.E. and incendiary bombs was dropped in good weatherby 479 aircraft. A highly-concentrated attack was delivered on the centre.of the;town, only a small proportion of the bombs spreading to the north and north-west.The resultant fires, including many large ones&apos;, were reported to have stretchedover the whole of the target area and reconnaissance, on the following day, was rendered abortive by the heavy pall of smoke still present over the city. Fromthe total of 572 aircraft despatched on this operation, 34 are missing and twocrashed.Mediterranean.Italy, Sicily and Sardinia.36. In seven attacks on Marsala, 500 tons of bombs were dropped. One ship was sunk, two others were set on fire and at&apos;least six Siebel ferries were hit; con-siderable damage was caused to railways and jetties in the dock area and toworkshops and barges at the seaplane base.Two attacks were made on Palermo on which 440 tons were dropped; a shipblew up and railway yards and buildings were seriously damaged.A total of 230 tons of bombs was dropped on Messina, Catania and Tripani.At Messina, hits were scored on the ferry terminus, on fuel installations and ongun positions; at Catania, an ammunition ship blew up, two other ships were seton fire, and fires were started along the whole length of the main mole; and atTrapani, the re-fuelling plant and the naval magazine were hit. Nearly 40 tonsof bombs were dropped on the harbour at Favignana (an island off Trapani) where two ships were damaged. Attacks were also made on Empedocle harbour, wherethe power and railway stations were hit, and on Marettimo.Fortresses (B. 17) made heavy attacks on the airfields at Milo and Borizzoand Wellingtons bombed Biscari airfield. Spitfires bombed railway targets atLicata.
In Italy, 133 tons were dropped on Reggio Di Calabria, where three ships were set on fire and fires started on the water front. Mosquitoes and Spitfiressuccessfully attacked railway buildings and trains in S.W. Italy.In Sardinia, Wellingtons dropped 18 tons of bombs on airfields at Villa-cidro, Decimomannu, Elmas and Monserrata.Sicilian Channel.37. Allied aircraft made many attacks on enemy shipping in the SicilianChannel.One large and three small ships, a destroyer and four Siebel ferries were sunk; one medium size and one small ship were probably sunk; one medium sizeship, two small ships, and one destroyer were set on fire, and several ships ofvarious sizes were damaged. Attacks were also made on other shipping, butresults were not observed.Six Mitchells (B. 25), escorted by 17 Lightnings (P. 38), encountered, sixescorted S.M. 82 (transport aircraft) in the Sicilian Channel. All the transport aircraft and three fighters were destroyed for the loss of two Lightnings.Tunisia and Pantelleria.Allied aircraft gave our land forces the fullest support throughout the week.On the 6th, the heaviest scale of air effort ever made in Africa was given insupport of the First Army, 2,188 sorties being flown.Enemy positions in the battle area, troops and M.T. concentrations in the back areas and lines of communication, especially congested road junctions, were heavily and continuously attacked. A large number of vehicles was destroyed or damaged and heavy casualties were inflicted on troops. The weight of these attacks may be gauged by the fact that, on the 8th, 83 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped on troop concentrations near Korbeas in the Cape Bon Peninsula.Heavy attacks were made on the remaining enemy landing grounds, all ofwhich were captured by our troops before the end of the week. Many aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground.On the 5th, heavy bombers attacked the harbour and railway yards at Tunisand the harbour at La Goulette, where barracks, oil installations and severalships were hit. Medium bombers attacked jetties at Kelibia and fighter-bombers attacked the harbour at Thonara (8-^ miles S.W. of Cape Bon).A large number of offensive sweeps were carried out by our fighters. Anoticeable feature of the week was the reluctance of enemy fighters to engage our fighters in combat.Pantelleria was attacked on four days by a total of about 470 medium, light and fie&quot;hter-bombers: 12 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground, large fires were started, in the petrol dump area and several E-boats and small craft inthe harbour were hit.As the result of Allied victories, the German Air Force had been compelledby the 7th to withdraw their main force to Sicily and Sardinia, leaving onlya small fighter force in the Cape Bon Peninsula. By the 9th, the remainingaircraft had been withdrawn.sEgean Sea..38. Beaufighters made daily attacks on enemy shipping in the ^gean; an800-ton ship was set on fire, five caiques were sunk and 12 other caiques were damaged. Beaufighters also attacked a harbour on Syros Island, scoring hits onquays and buildings.Operational Sorties and Battle Casualties.39. During the week, 14,233 sorties were flown in the Mediterranean area and the following&apos; casualties are reported.: Destroyed orMissing.      Damaged. ,Allied      ...      ...... 46        .100 uUDestroyed.     Probable.     Damaged.Enemy      ......       ...      95 21 53No account is taken of aircraft destroyed on the ground.
Russia.40. The main feature of Russian air activity was the daily bombing ofrailway junctions and airfields behind the German lines, from Novgorod on LakeIlmen in the north to the Sea of Azov in the south, and as far west as Brest-Litovsk. Stretches of railways between important railway junctions were also attacked. These raids were very successful and large numbers of german aircraft were destroyed on the ground and many troop-carrying trains and railway installations were severely damaged. More than 150 tons of bombs were dropped on Brest-Litovsk, where serious damage was done to trains, repair shops and barrack buildings.In the Kuban, the Soviet Air Force was actively engaged in attacks on enemyland forces and in battle with enemy aircraft.The German Air Force was forced to maintain a considerable scale of effort in the south because of continued Russian pressure against Novorossisk and of anumber of landings behind the German lines in the Crimea.On the rest of the front there was increased strategic bombing by theGermans of railways, airfields and centres of communication, particularly in the&apos;&apos;sector between the Kirsk salient and the Sea of Azov.   Long-range bombersraided the town and harbour of Murmansk.Burma and India.41. Offensive operations, which were maintained at a comparatively high level, were directed principally against railway installations, bridges andindustrial targets in the Mandalay region and in harassing attacks, in supportof our troops on the Upper Chindwin and Akyab fronts and along the Mayuriver. In five days over 140 tons of bombs were dropped, the heaviest operationsbeing carried out by Liberators (B. 24), which, during two attacks on Toungoo,released a total of 52 tons of H.E.; railway tracks and rolling-stock were hit andthe town was severely damaged. A railway bridge near Mogaung was hit withfour 1000-lb. bombs dropped by Kittyhawks (P. 40). Mitchells (B. 25) made threehits on a bridge over the Mu river and six hits on Myitnge bridge and itsapproaches.An average of approximately 35 sorties were flown daily by fighters onoffensive sweeps and in raids on villages in Japanese occupation, on enemy supplycolumns and on small river craft, of which more than 50 were either destroyed or seriously damaged.Twenty-four enemy bombers caused some damage at Dohazari airfield(India), which, however, remained serviceable. Japanese dive-bombers, with fighter escort, attacked Bawli Bazar in south-east Bengal, but details are notavailable.China Zone.42. Twenty-six escorted heavy and medium bombers (one escorting fighteris missing) attacked the airfield at Sama (Hainan Island) dropping 25 tons of bombs; the runways were hit and fires were started in the dock area and an oil refinery. A similar force raided Tienho and White Cloud airfields at Canton;heavy damage to hangars resulted, five aircraft were destroyed on the ground and,in addition, 16 intercepting enemy fighters were shot down in the air, five more probably destroyed and two damaged. One Allied bomber was lost and one of theescorts force-landed away from base. Nine Mitchells (B. 25) bombed dock instal-lations at Haiphong (French Indcv-China), where warehouses and an ammunitionstore were hit.Enemy bombers attacked Kienningfu (360 miles N.E.  of Hong Kong),damaging the runway.Pacific Zone.Neiv Guinea.43. The airfield at Madang, where intense activity had been observed, was bombed on&apos; three occasions; in this area, an east-bound troop-carrying ship of1,000 tons was sunk and a small tanker damaged. On two nights, Catalinas(PBY) attacked Babo, in the McCluer Gulf, which is becoming one of thelarger Japanese air bases behind their advance line&apos; of airfields; explosions and fires were seen on wharves and in the dispersal areas, where three aircraft were destroyed on the ground and a further 13 were machine-gunned.
Aru Islands.44. Beaufighters (one is missing) destroyed nine waterborne seaplanes anda lugger at Taberfane, 24 miles S.S.W. of Dobu.A australia.45. Millinginibi airfield, on the north coast, was raided twice by Japanesebombers. In the first attack slight damage only was caused. In the second, aBeaufighter on the ground was destroyed and a small supply ship, lying off shore,was sunk. Allied fighters, one of which is missing, shot down two of the raidersand destroyed or seriously damaged three others.Solomon Islands.46. An attack by Dauntless (A. 24) dive-bombers on enemy destroyers is dealt with under &quot;Naval Situation.&quot;Aleutian Islands.47.

APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week :-Germany.Stuttgart. It now appears that the damage to the main station and to railway facilities in the neighbourhood, after the attack on the 14th/ 15th April,resulted in a more severe dislocation in traffic working than the photographic reconnaissance would have led one to believe. Three important trunk lines were still not open to traffic on the 17th April. Eight locomotives were put out ofaction and the signalling system, which is power worked and in consequence very ^vulnerable to air attack, was again badly damaged. (It required nearly eight weeks fully to restore the signalling system after the November attack.) Inaddition, many of the lines in the Stuttgart area are electrified, current being-obtained from overhead wires, and damage to these added considerably to thegeneral dislocation.Duisburg -In the attack on the 26th/27th April, the Thyssen Steel RollingMills at Mulheim suffered very heavy damage. So few buildings were unaffectedthat work was completely stopped. Damage was also caused to the Duisburgmunicipal waterworks.Mannheim. As a result of damage to railway yards in the attack on the16th/17th April, all through traffic including coal to Italy via the all-rail routehad to be diverted via Schwetzingen and dislocation was felt as far as Freiburg.France,Lille. The damage caused to the locomotive repair shops at Hellemmes inthe attack on the 13th January, 1943, by the U.S.A.A.F. was so extensive that work at these shops has not been resumed, and the staff have been distributed among other locomotive shops in France.A ulnoye. As a result of the daylight attacks on the locomotive repair shopson the 4th and 8th March, the main shop was so badly damaged as to render itunserviceable and it was estimated that repairs would take at least two months.Holland.Ijmuiden. Photographs taken on the 4th May show damage caused by the daylight attacks on the 2nd and 3rd May. In the works of M.E.K.O.G. (whichin pre-war days supplied gas to the Royal Dutch Steelworks) the coke oven plant was severely damaged at one end,, an L-shaped building (covering an area of2,500 sq. yards) engaged on ammonium sulphate production and ammoniadistillation was almost completely destroyed, the compressor house severely damaged, and the roof of the ammonium sulphate silo destroyed over an area of atleast 150 ft. by 100 ft.In addition, a workshop (160 ft. by 40 ft.) of the Velsen Generating station was almost completely destroyed while a direct hit severed the railway lineserving the steelworks.
