(43) 71st CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 3 (1)).Note by the Minister of Production.IN the annex to Paper W.P. (43) 196, the position in regard to the AirMinistry building programme was stated as follows : Requirements Allocationstated. -     proposed.(A) (B).(thousands)30th April   ............

Actually the labour force on this programme has been maintained at orslightly above the level of the figures in column A for April and May and. it wouldnot now be possible to scale it down at once to the lower level of column B.In fact, having regard to the requirements of efficient working, it would not nowbe practicable to scale it down more rapidly than is indicated by the following : &apos; (C)(thousands)110105958580803. I have therefore asked the Secretary of State for Air to examine theconsequences to his programme of a labour force as at (0) above. He has informed me that the effect would be to delay the provision of accommodation for some 50 R.A.F. squadrons and 20 U.S.A.A.F. groups, together with essentialprojects in Fighter, Coastal, Flying Training, Transport and MaintenanceCommands, all of which were due to become available during the month ofSeptember, by three or four weeks as compared with two months under theprevious allocation&quot; (column&quot;B in paragraph 1). A large number of projects due for completion after September would be similarly delayed.4. This calculation takes no account of difficulties in moving labour to the required places (which have already delayed the programme) nor of other setbacksin construction, which experience shows almost inevitably occur.5.   The Secretary of State, while grateful for the improved prospects shown by the revised figures, nevertheless remains unable for his part to accept the grave consequences, more especially to the Anglo-American bomber offensive, which are involved.   He has pointed out that failure to provide accommodation for the[25498]let.   May 1943.//\ copy No-   OO30th April31st May.......30th June        ..:31st July......31st August30th September ...
American formations may well result in the transfer of these forces to the Pacific.Alternatively, if the American programme of arrivals is adhered to and accom-modation is provided for them at the required elates, the expansion of the RoyalAir Force would be still further impeded. The result would be that the increasedAmerican day bombing effort would be achieved at the expense of our own Britishnight bombing offensive, and an increased, number of British aircraft with trainedcrews would remain idle and unused.6. The position in regard to the call-up of men for the Forces is summarizedin the Annex. It will be seen that even if the call-up is modified to the maximum possible extent, we cannot now maintain the Air Ministry building labour force at more than 95,000 from the end of June onwards (80.000 plus 15,000).7. The question for decision is, therefore, whether the Air Ministryconstruction programme should be delayed by a few weeks or whether we shouldmitigate this delay by deferring the call-up of 15,000 men to the Forces so as toretain them in the building industry at least until the end of September.O. L.Ministry of Production, S. W. 1,28th May, 1943,ANNEX.ON existing plans the Army and the R.A.F. will have received by the end,of June practically the whole intake to which they were entitled for the 18 months to the end of December 1943. The Admiralty will still have a considerable numberof men due to them.2. For this reason, and because of the overriding necessity of manningships as they become available, it seems reasonable to assume that any modificationof the call-up must affect the Army and/or the RA.F. only.3. The greater part of the call-up from the building industry to the services for the 6 months, April to September, was due to fall in the months of April, Mayand June. Arrangements for the first call-up day in June have already been set in train. The maximum number whose call-up could now be deferred forthe benefit of the building industry would be about 15,000 men. of whom 7,000are due for call-up in the second half of June and che remainder in the following three months.4. If the call-up of this number of men from the building industry were tobe deferred, this could be off-set to a small extent by calling up men more rapidlyfrom other sources; but it cannot be stated at all precisely how far this would, bepossible and so far as it might be decided to draw more men from those sources inthe months from June to September, there would be so many fewer men to come forward in the later months of the year. If, therefore, the building labour force is to be left with some 15,000 additional men at the end of September, the Armyand the R.A.F. would have to go short by substantially the whole of this amount&apos;.5. This would not mean that the intake into the Army and the R.A.F. wouldbe substantially, if at all, below the numbers approved, for them by the WarCabinet last November. It would, however, interfere to the extent indicated withthe maintenance of these Services at the strengths at which they have beenaiming in recent months. The question of further recruitment for these services will fall to be considered in connection with the further review of man-powerprepared, by the Minister of Labour (L.P. (43) 115).28th May, 1943.
