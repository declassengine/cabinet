THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.67SECRET.Copy No. 2W.P. (43) 218.May 25, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.AUSTRIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate herewith to my colleagues a paper on the future of Austria.As the tide of war turns increasingly in our favour, the possibility of causingembarrassment to Germany by encouragirfg resistance and sabotage in Austriaimproves. At present our efforts are hampered by the fact that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have no declared policy as regards the future of Austria. In thefirst place, therefore, I seek the general approval of my colleagues for the con-clusions set out in the last paragraph of the paper.If these conclusions are approved, I would then propose to communicatecopies of the paper to the Dominion Governments and, at the same time, to enterinto discussion with the United States and Soviet Governments with a view to securing their agreement with the policy described. If general, agreement is secured, I shall hope that it may be possible to issue in due course an. agreeddeclaration promising a free and independent Austria with suitable politicaland economic safeguards.1.   Article 80 of the Treaty of Versailles reads : &quot; Germany acknowledges and will respect strictly the independence of Austria, within the frontiers which may be fixed m a treaty between that State and the principal Allied and Associated Powers; she agrees thatthis independence shall be inalienable except with the consent of the Councilof the League of Nations.&quot;Article 88 of the Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye reads :  &apos;&apos; The independence of Austria is inalienable otherwise than with theconsent of the Council of the League of Nations. Consequently Austriaundertakes, in the absence of the consent of the said Council, to abstain from any act which might directly or indirectly or by any means whatevercompromise her independence, particularly, and until her admission to membership of the League, of Nations, by participation in the affairs of another Power.&quot;2. During the years 1919 to 1938, His Majesty&apos;s Government at various times made it clear that they regarded-the maintenance of Austria&apos;s independenceas an interest of their own, and that they would take a most serious view of anyviolation of the treaties which would be calculated to imperil Austria&apos;s freedom.A. E.Foreign Office, May 25, 1943.Introduction.12044   [25492]b
3. On the 11th March, 1938, German troops marched into Austria. HisMajesty&apos;s Government protested in the strongest terms both in London andBerlin against the use by the German Government of coercion, backed by force,against an independent State in order to create a situation incompatible withits national independence. But on the 2nd April, 1938, His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Berlin was instructed to inform the German Government thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to withdraw His Majesty&apos;s Legationfrom Vienna and to replace it by a Consulate-General. Thenceforward, HisMajesty&apos;s Government may be said, for all practical purposes, to have recognised the annexation of Austria by Germany.4. The present attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Austriawas most recently stated by the Secretary of State in the House of commons on the 9th September and the 16th December, 1942. On the 9th September,Mr. Eclen said: &quot;The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Austriawas stated by my right honourable Friend the Prime Minister at the MansionHouse on the 9th November, 1940, when he said that Austria is one of thecountries&apos;for whom we have drawn the sword and for whom our victory willsupply liberation. While His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot, of course, commit themselves at this stage to recognise or support the establishment in the futureof any particular frontiers in Central Europe, I must make it plain that HisMajesty&apos;s Government do not regard themselves as being bound by any changeeffected in Austria in and since 1938.&quot; On the 16th December Mr. Eden said :&apos;&apos; In my speech at Leamington on the 26th September, I referred to the existingPolish-Czechoslovak and Greek-Yugoslav agreements and said that, so faras we were concerned, we should continue to foster agreements of this kind andto encourage smaller States to weld themselves into larger, though not exclusive,groupings. Whether it will be possible or desirable-to include Austria and hungary within a federation based&apos; upon Poland and Czechoslovakia must clearly depend, amongst other things, upon the views of the Polish and Czecho-slovak Governments and peoples and upon the future attitude of the Austriansand Hungarians, who are now fighting in the ranks of our enemies.&quot;Historical Review.5. Situated at the geographical centre of Europe, Austria is intimatelyconcerned in many of the most vital issues of European politics and economies.The Latin, Slav and Teutonic worlds meet within or at the Austrian frontiers.A great Power which gains control of Vienna and the Austrian Danube is likelyto be the economic master of Danubia. Strategically, either Austria can providethe German salient by the use of which an aggressive Germany can destroy allresistance in Danubia; or, together with the Bohemian bastion, Austria can formthe only line of defence for Danubia against such a Germany. Again, Austriaforms the strategic extension of Switzerland and can serve to separate germany from Italy and to cut the line of the Axis which, in this war, has shut Danubiaoff from Western Europe. Austria is, from several points of view, the keystoneof the European arch.6. .The Austrians are a German people, sharing the inheritance of Germanthought and art. But their vocation through more than five centuries has beenDanubian, and, living as they do at the crossing of so many ways, they are, bytradition, Europeans. This perhaps helps to explain why the great majority ofAustrians can hardly be said to have been nationally conscious before 1918.7. After the last war the majority of Austrians desired inclusion inGermany. The reasons are not far to seek. So determinedly did the DanubianStates shake the dust of Austria from their feet that to the Austrians it seemed clear that their eastern mission had ended. Their ship had. foundered and sunk.They were as men huddled in mid-ocean on the raft of German-Austria. Mostnaturally they welcomed the chance of scrambling on to another vessel to whichthey were invited in their own language. Further, it was apparently a new andwholly changed Germany which extended, the invitation. The Social-Democrats,who were at first in charge of the Austrian Government, saw their Germanfellow-Socialists in power in Berlin and promulgating the charter of liberties ofthe German workers. To them, moreover, the only chance of rendering their control of Austria permanent seemed to be in a union, with the great German socialdemocratic republic. The Christian Socialists saw the beginnings of that con-siderable influence which their colleagues of the Centrum were to exercise inGermany for the next fourteen years.  Thus the two great parties which between
them had the support of six-sevenths of the Austrian electorate, saw their respec-tive causes flourishing in the Reich; while the remaining seventh consisted of theGerman Nationalists, for whom union with Germany was their basic politicalprinciple.8. The Allied and Associated Powers forbade union with Germany, yet tookno effective steps to ensure that Austria should enjoy at least some economic co-operation with the other Successor States. It was not until 1922, when theeconomic situation had become desperate, that the Western Powers awoke to austria&apos;s need of support if she was to bear the burden of the independence whichhad been forced upon her. The necessary loans were supplied in return forguarantees of Austrian independence, and three years later, after the applicationof the League of Nations scheme, Sir W. Layton and Professor Rist submitted a paper which bore testimony to the recovery made by Austria. The recovery wenton for a short time, and although it was not fully maintained, Austrians began tohave a certain confidence in their country, especially as they observed thedifficulties with which Germany had to struggle. Even before the advent of theThird Reich, the idea of an A nschluss with Germany had lost some of its appeal.When Dr. Schober tried to achieve the customs union with Germany in 1931, heacted without the support either of the Social Democrats or of the ChristianSocialists.9. Already in 1926 the Austrian Nazis were affiliated to the Hitlerite Nazis,and in 1930 and 1931 Hitler shewed, by his appointment of a Gauleiter for Viennaand then of a Reich German as Inspector of the N.S.D.A.P. in Austria, that hewas as devoted as ever to his intention to effect the Anschluss. As soon as the nazis gained power, a stream of threatening propaganda began, then Germantourists were forbidden to visit Austria. A legion of Austrian Nazis was formed in Germany and the organisation of violence in Austria itself developed. ManyAustrians, particularly amongst the disinherited intelligentsia and the students,who feared future unemployment, responded to the Nazi appeal. But a large body of Austrian opinion swung over rapidly from a disinterested attitude topositive opposition to the A nschluss.10.   Yet, when at last Hitler struck, the plebiscite of the 10th April, 1938,recorded over 99 per cent, of votes for the A nschluss.   The apologists for Austria,claim that, deserted by the Western Powers, the Austrians were cowed by theclatter of German guns and tanks and overwhelmed by the roar of Germanbombers; that long before the plebiscite all the leading opponents of the A nschlusswere either dead or imprisoned; that infected by the lust of sensation theysuccumbed to Nazi showmanship; that they had not fared so well under the versailles system that they might not hope to fare better in association withGermany; and, finally, that Hitler&apos;s plebiscite meant nothing but the surrender ofthe majority of the Austrians to force.   There is, of course, something in all this.But it would be foolish to ignore the fact that the Austrian Republic of 1919-38did not succeed in arousing the patriotic devotion of its citizens.   The majorityof them gradually came to acquiesce in it, but few of them felt any strong positiveloyalty towards it.   Nor is this surprising.   German-Austria was no long-established historical entity.   There had never been a State consisting of theGerman-Austrian provinces of the Dual Monarchy, and when the new Sta,te was set up it could appeal to no deep-rooted national sentiment.   In another respect the new State had a bad start.    The extensive and desperate poverty which followed the end of the last war led to a loss of morale, particularly among themiddle classes, who never fully recovered their position.  The western democracieswere slow to realise their responsibility towards the new State and, in fact, nevershouldered the burden squarely.   It was left to the Dolfuss dictatorship to seekand obtain the support of Italy.  With the withdrawal of that support after theestablishment of the Rome-Berlin Axis, the regime, which could speak for neithera democratic nor a united Austria, became more and more shaky in the face ofGerman pressure and probably nothing could then have saved it except the armedintervention of the Western Powers.   It is true that in the very last days of austrian independence signs of a genuine Austrian patriotism did emerge.   Butit.seems for the most part to have been a negative emotion derived from oppositionto Nazi ideology and Nazi methods, rather than a positive enthusiasm for independent Austria as such; and, even so, it was not shared by the whole population.11. Immediately after the occupation of Austria by German troops inMarch 1938, Austria was declared a &quot;land&quot; of the German Reich under[25492] - p 2
an Austrian Federal Government in Vienna, with Seyss-Inquart at its head. Atthe same time the first steps were taken to transform this status into one of com-plete absorption into the administrative system of the Reich. On the 15th march the German law of the 30th January, 1934, for the Reconstruction of the Reichwas declared valid in Austria. This meant the abolition of representative govern-ment and the transfer of the sovereign rights of the former Austrian State to the reich. The Austrian Federal Government became the Austrian provincial government and Seyss-Inquart received the title of Reichsstatthalter in Austria.The next step was taken by the Ostmark law of the 4th April, 1939. This set out a plan of administration by provinces, converted into Reichsgaue, which was putinto operation on the 1st April, 1940. The effect of this measure was to destroyAustria as a territorial unit of administration. Some time later even the termOstmark, the last symbol of Austrian unity, was dropped and all laws relating toformer Austria used the phrase &quot; Alpen and Donau Reichsgaue.&quot;12. Despite the Anschluss, Austria remains to-day, in many respects, adifferent country from the Reich. The feeling in Austria that &apos;&apos; Austrians are different from Germans &quot; not only persists, but is growing stronger. Already in1941 there were growing doubts as to whether the Anschluss was worth it at theprice of war. During 1942 this disillusionment increased and ripened, thoughit has not yet taken any clear political form. There have been signs recently of growing discontent. But the grip of the Gestapo on Austria is strong : Austriantroops continue to fight against us, and Austrian industry works full time for theGerman war machine.13. There is probably nothing Austrians desire so much as the end of thewar, and there is certainly less fear in Austria than in Germany of the conse-quences of defeat. But, while the majority of Austrians are very probablyunited in their dislike of the Nazi regime, there seems no agreement as to whatthe future of Austria should be; and there is little evidence that Austrians.anywhere are prepared to make violent exertions for the sake of their freedom.The Future of Austria.14. Austria&apos;s future will be one of the most difficult questions with whichstatesmen will be faced after the war. Austria has been at different times theleading State in a German confederation, the head of a largely non-german empire in South-East Europe, an independent State and an integral part of a unitary German State. Her history and her geographical position offer littleguidance, therefore, as to her future destiny. It is very likely that, invokingarticles 2 and 3 of the Atlantic Charter, Austrians will claim the right to decidetheir own future.-  15.   It is proposed in the following paragraphs to examine the four mainpossible solutions of the Austrian problem which merit serious consideration.These are (1) The association of Austria with Germany, either as an integral part ofthe Reich or on a federal basis;(2) The inclusion of Austria in a south German confederation;(3) The restoration of Austria as a free and independent State; and(4) The inclusion of Austria in a Central or East European confederation.(1) Association of Austria with Germany.16. It is difficult to estimate what the attitude of the Austrian populationtowards Germany will be after the war. It is highly probable that they will behostile to continued inclusion in a National Socialist Germany; it is not socertain that a regenerated democratic Germany might not still exert a strong-pull, especially in Austrian Socialist circles. However, the condition of Germanyafter the war, both politically and economically, is not likely to be such as toencourage a small State, provided it is offered satisfactory economic and politicalguarantees, to link its fate with hers. It is probable, therefore, that Austrianopinion will be opposed to maintenance of the status quo, the more so as, whereasGermany will suffer the consequences of defeat even more than after the last war,Austria may well hope to escape her share of responsibility and retribution byrepudiating Nazidom. Positive steps could and. should be taken to stimulate thishope by a policy of deliberate differentiation between the treatment accorded bythe United Nations to Germany and Austria when victory is won.
17. The political and strategic arguments in favour of detaching Austriafrom Germany are very strong. Vienna is the political, economic and strategicgateway to South-Eastern Europe. German control of Austria constitutes apermanent threat to Italy and to the Succession States. It is true that, if thefuture peace settlement leaves Hungary less aggrieved, she would not necessarilyagain threaten Czechoslovakia from the rear; but, even so, the possession byGermany of upper and lower Austria robs the western frontiers of Bohemia ofmore than half their defensive value, and the German-Hungarian frontier,however drawn, would be practically indefensible by Hungary. Further, theTyrol separates Germany from Italy and gives Italy valuable additional protec-tion, even if she still retains the Brenner frontier.18. It should also be taken into account that Germany without Austriacontains several millions fewer Germans and that the German war potential ispro tan-to reduced.(2) Inclusion of Austria in a South German Confederation.19. If Germany is split up, it is possible to envisage the creation of a southGerman State. In this new State Austria might be associated with Bavaria, with or without Wurtemberg and Baden. The result would be a predominantlyCatholic State. The creation of such a south German State could, however, onlybe undertaken if it received strong positive support from the people immediately concerned.20. The Bavarians and Austrians dislike the Prussians, but this is toonegative a sentiment on which to build a union between them. Feeling betweenBavarians and Austrians has, in fact, never been particularly friendly. both countries, it is true, are predominantly Catholic, and there are cultural affinities;but there is also cultural rivalry. There are monarchist elements in both, but their loyalties are directed to different dynasties. After the last war the specialties drawing Bavaria and Austria together were to be found rather among-the extremists of the Left and Right and they were used by these groups, especially the latter, as weapons in the political conflict raging within their respective countries. The Soviet Bavaria of Kurt Eisner naturally saw in &quot; red Vienna &quot;a possible ally in its fight against what it regarded as the reactionary pseudo-socialism which held power in the Reich. But Eisner did not go to the pointof advocating the creation of an Austro-Bavarian State; his aim was a federation including Germany and Austria. Similarly, the reactionary Bavariaof Kahr, who was backed by Ludendorf, saw a. possible ally in its struggle againstthe Weimar regime, in the Conservative provinces of Salzburg and the Tyrol,which for a time seemed prepared to contemplate separation from Austria andunite with Germany. But concrete proposals on the part of those provinces forunion with Bavaria, as distinct from the Reich as a whole, took the form ofadvocating only what was considered an &quot;economic union.&quot; The plebiscitesheld in Salzburg and the Tyrol in 1921 yielded a substantial majority for union with Germany; the question of union with Bavaria was not raised.21. More generally, it is clear that, owing to the preponderance it.wouldgive to the German element, a German State stretching from Vienna to Stuttgartand Freiburg, or even from Vienna to Munich, could not be a member&apos; of a south-East European confederation. By joining it, Austria would forfeit herclaim to be treated as a Danubian State, and would be thrown permanently into that close association with Germany which it should be our primary aim to break.(3) Austria as an Independent State.22. It is be accepted that it is our primary aim to wean Austria from hertraditional association with Germany, we must clearly reject the first two ofthe four possible solutions put forward in paragraph 15 above, viz., the associationof Austria with Germany and the inclusion of Austria in a South Germanconfederation. Excluding the possibility of the partition of Austria, it wouldseem to follow that we must then accept as the only practicable alternative therestoration of an independent State of Austria, which might either stand alone or form part of a Central or South-East European confederation. But this will prove no easy solution; involving as it does, firstly, the re-creation of an AustrianState and, secondly, a sustained effort on the part of the Great Powers to ensureits survival.23. We are faced at the outset with the handicap that there is no austrian government in exile representing the Austrian unity that has been destroyed or[25492] b 3
ready to return and take control through the period of re-creation. Nor is therethe slightest prospect of building up a representative Austrian Council orCommittee from the material available in this country, in the United States or elsewhere outside Austria. Not only is there no unity amongst the rival Austrianrefugee groups, even if unity were achieved, there are, with the possible exceptionof Dr. Dobretzberger, no personalities whose names carry any weight at all un austria to-day. The Austrian people themselves will have to throw up the firstresponsible Government of restored Austria. . -24. It is very difficult to assess the strength of the support in Austria forthe Habsburg cause. It is certainly not widespread. But in any case therestoration of the Archduke Otto is virtually excluded by the fact that Austriaunder a Habsburg ruler could not hope for any kind of relations with Poland,Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia or for inclusion in any conceivable confederation.25. Austria will probably not need to make any special effort to detach itselffrom Germany. The machinery which links the Austrian Beichgaue with theCentral Government of Germany is of recent creation, it is closely associated withthe Nazis and it is largely manned by Nazi personnel. Consequently it would very likely be shattered by a revolution which drove the Nazis out of Austria.Further, when the United Nations occupy Germany, it will rest with them whether to administer Austria as part of Germany or not. In the later event,they could do much to help Austria to complete her disentanglement fromGermany and to rebuild an independent Austrian Constitution and administration.26. But what of the Austrian people ? Will they be willing to assume once more the responsibilities of independence ? On the whole it is unlikely, at all events in the early stages, that they will wish to maintain their association withGermany even if they were allowed to do so. The position is likely to be radicallydifferent from that which prevailed in 1918 (see paragraph 7 above). If anindependent Austria emerges after this war, she will do so .by emancipatingherself-from a tyrannical German rule which, so far from giving Austria thefederal status which was the least that even Germanophil Austrians hoped for,destroyed her unity even as an administrative region. Moreover, whereasGermany will suffer the consequences of defeat more heavily than after the last war, the Austrian people may well hope to escape them almost altogether byrepudiating Nazidom and, of course, with Nazidom, Germany.27. It will be appreciated, however, that it is not possible to build verysolidly on a negative basis of this sort. Will the years of subjection to Nazityranny have strengthened or killed altogether the tender plant of Austriannational sentiment which even before the access of the Nazis to power wasbeginning to make growth and to deprive the conception of an Anschluss of someof its appeal ? It is impossible to say. It can only be noted that the circumstancesattendant on the re-establishment of a responsible independent Government un austria are likely to be difficult. Particularist sentiment, which has always bsenstrong in Austria, may well be reinforced by local political antagonisms, as, forinstance, between a Conservative south-west and a predominantly Socialistnorth-east; and clashes between Republicans and Legitimists are possible. Eventhough the majority of Austrians may be in favour of the restoration of their independence, there will inevitably be dispersion of loyalty and effort which mightmore profitably be concentrated on rebuilding the State.28. It would thus be foolish to expect an easy evolution of the politicalsituation in Austria after the war. But, assuming that, with the help and encouragement of the United Nations, an independent Austrian State successfullyovercomes its political teething troubles, what are its economic prospects ? It isclear that the disentangling of the Austrian economy from that of the Reich,with which it has become more and more closely integrated in the course of thewar, will in the early stages cause considerable dislocation. But when these difficulties have been overcome, what are the long-term prospects? A careful examination of the Austrian national income and of movements of the standardof living makes it clear that Austria in the inter-war period did not solve her economic problems. This was due partly to the failure of the various AustrianGovernments to pursue an active policy of finding employment for the labour and capital resources of the country, and partly to the various forms of trade barrierswhich impeded economic relations with the outside world. The two causes wereinter-related, since, owing to the restrictions on foreign trade, the pursuit of an
active internal policy would inevitably have increased the adverse foreign balance.It is none the less true that, theoretically, a sound internal economic policy wouldhave made it possible to maintain, and even slightly increase, the national income,even in spite of. the conditions prevailing in world trade, and that internationalloans to Austria might have been used as a lever to encourage the adoption ofsuch a policy. But this would have required a Government strong enough toassert itself against vested interests and to demand and secure a great and concerted effort on the part of all classes. Political conditions at the time made this practically impossible, and the prospects, even if it could have been done,were not rosy enough to overcome the general pessimism about the future ofAustria as an independent State. If the conditions of the period 1918-38 are reproduced after this war, the same conclusions win follow : Austria could existand under wise Government could prevent a deterioration of her economic position. But she would have little hope of securing substantial improvement,and the bask set to her Government would be an exceedingly severe one. It willbe seen, therefore, that to be prosperous Austria, more perhaps than most States,will be dependent on a satisfactory solution of the wider problems of post-warinternational trade.29. To sum up, there may well be a fairly strong movement in Austriaafter the war in favour of the restoration of Austrian independence. But this movement will probably be inspired at least as much by a reaction from.Nazityranny as by any positive national sentiment, and the evolution of a responsibleAustrian Government is likely to be attended by great difficulties. On the longer term view, it would be foolish to underestimate the attraction which a regeneratedGermany might still exert, in certain circumstances, on Austria. The ties of blood and language are strong and the restored independent Austrian State willhave to be assured by the Great Powers of a degree of political and economicsecurity not substantially lower than she might expect from association withGermany, if she is to have the will to maintain her independence. If Austria isrestored, this is a responsibility that the Great Powers must face squarely.Inclusion of Austria in a Confederation.30. National unity and internal political stability are as essential forAustria as a member of a confederation as they are for Austria, as an independent state. Membership of a confederation would not, therefore, solve any of theimmediate problems with which an independent Austria will be faced after thewar; it could only help to assure to Austria some part of that political andeconomic security without which the Austrian people may come to regardindependence as not worth maintaining. If it led to the re-establishment of austrian trading, financial and other connexions with all or large parts of theformer Habsburg territories, it would clearly link Austria more closely with hereastern and south-eastern neighbours &quot;and thus weaken her connexion withGermany.31. But what advantages would the inclusion of Austria confer on aconfederation which, for arguments sake, might consist of Poland, Czecho-slovakia, Austria and Hungary? And how would the other partners view herinclusion in it? Politically, Austria might be able to render important services to such a confederation. The Austrian people are less nationalistic than most ofthe peoples of Europe, and they might be able to exercise a moderating influence on their Danubian neighbours. From the cultural point of view, the contribution of Austria as a whole and of Vienna in particular would be of the first importance. Finally, the acceptance of Austria into such a confederation mightbe expected to strengthen her in her resistance to German domination, which it isclearly a. paramount interest of the - neighbouring States to encourage.Strategically, the domination of Austria by Germany presents a permanent threat to South-Eastern Europe. Conversely, effective measures for the defence ofAustria could probably best be taken if considered as an integral part of thedefence measures of South-Eastern Europe as a whole. An independent Austriaon the 1919-38 model could never have the necessary military strength to defendherself. The strategic protection which her territories provide for the exposedfrontiers of her neighbours could only be utilised to the full if she were includedin an East European Confederation, disposing of very considerable militaryforces. Economically, it is probable that an East European Confederation wouldbe strengthened by the inclusion of Austrian industries. The natural economicconnexions of Eastern Austria are with the Middle Danube area, Before 1918the bulk of its trade was with other parts of the Dual Monarchy.   Vienna was
the banking centre for the whole of the Monarchy and for the Balkans as well.Moreover, the easiest communications between Bohemia and Poland on the onehand and South-Eastern Europe on the other pass through Vienna. Despite theeconomic changes which have occurred in Austria since 1918, these fundamentalgeographical facts and their economic consequences remain unaltered.32. There are, of course, also important arguments on the other side. TheSouth-East European peoples, if they are prepared to admit Austria at all totheir confederation, would only admit her as an equal, not as a senior partner.Probably, Austria would have no desire to claim for herself the dominant positionformerly held by the Germans of the Austrian Empire; but the other peoples ofthe Confederation may well feel some doubts on this point, however unfounded,and they may in particular be nervous of the development within the confederation-tion of an Austro-Magyar alliance reminiscent of the old Austro-HungarianDualism. Moreover, during the inter-war period,-the successor States have beenbusy building up their own industries and banking systems. They will no doubt have some anxiety, if Austria is admitted to membership, that even if she makes no effort to regain the political hegemony, her geographical position, herindustries and her banking system may give her economic predominance in thispart of Europe. Perhaps most important of all there is likely to be a very livelyfear that Austria might become a centre of disturbance within the confederationby serving as a stepping stone for German penetration and as a camouflage for activities pursued in Germany&apos;s interests. Nor can the possibility be ignored of arapprochement at a later date between Austria and a revived and reformed,Germany. In recent years many East europe on States possessing Germanminorities have found them a source of great trouble and danger. In some ofthese States the idea of expatriating these minorities, should opportunity offer, is becoming widely popular. They may well feel that the fewer Germans the confederation contains the safer -it will be, and that on that ground alone theywould prefer a confederation which did not include Austria.33/ As regards the attitude towards Austria of the individual potentialpartners in a Confederation, there is no reason to believe that any of them con-siders the inclusion of Austria essential to its success. President Benes hashowever stated that Czechoslovakia would not oppose the admission of a demo-cratic Austria and would indeed welcome it. General Sikorski has expressed himself in favour of the establishment of a Free Austria, but it is known thatPolish circles are not at present favourably inclined to the idea of the inclusionof Austria in a Confederation, mainly on the grounds that she might constitute a dangerous fifth-column element. The Hungarian Government has of coursemade no official pronouncement on the subject, but there has been an indication that official circles in Hungary recognise that the future of Hungary may lie in association with a Confederation which&quot; would include Austria.34. It is very difficult to strike the balance between the advantages and dis-advantages of the inclusion of Austria in a Central or South-East EuropeanConfederation. Much will depend on political and other factors, which are atpresent incalculable. It is indeed by no means certain that any such confederation-tion will come into being, anyhow immediately after the war. It would thenclearly be foolish to reckon on partnership in such a Confederation providing an easy and immediate solution of the Austrian problem. In the circumstances, itwould seem that the first step must be the restoration of a free and independentAustrian State, standing alone. It must however be realised that whateverinternational guarantee such a State receives, it will inevitably be weak and there-fore a potential danger spot. Anything that can be should be done to strengthenAustria&apos;s international position, and to this end the way should be left open forher inclusion if circumstances permit, in whatever form of international orregional structure may develop in Central and South-Eastern Europe.Conclusions.35.   The foregoing study would seem to justify the following conclusions : (i) In the interests of peace and security in Central and South-eastern europe, it is essential to encourage and maintain Austrian resistance to domination by German)&apos;.(ii) The first step to this end must be the re-creation of an independentAustrian State. In the absence of an Austrian Government in exileand of any pronounced Austrian national sentiment, this step will need careful planning and execution.
(iii) Once restored, an independent Austria must from the start be given -preferential treatment as compared with Germany. Austria will onlysurvive if the United Nations are prepared not only to eschew penal-ising her for her past misdeeds but actively to afford her sustainedsupport and encouragement both in the political and economic field.Failure on the part of the United Nations to shoulder this responsi-bility will almost inevitably result in the end in the return of Austriato the German fold.(iv) The best chance of maintaining Austrian independence probably lies inthe ultimate association of Austria with some form&quot; of Central or south-East European Confederation. But this consummation must obviously depend largely on the way which such a confederationevolves, and on the wishes of the partners in it.(v) Meanwhile any plans for relief and reconstruction in the Central andSouth-Eastern European area should include Austria within theft&apos;scope. It should thus be possible so to direct Austria&apos;s internalreconstruction that subsequent inclusion in a confederation, ifcircumstance made it desirable, would represent a fulfilment of thepolicy which had been pursued in the interim and not a reversal of it.
