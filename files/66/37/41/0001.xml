THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GQYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,        n      M   3SECRET.------------- Copy No-dIt is requested that special care may be taken toansure the secrecy of this documentW.P. (43) 241.15th June, 1943WAR CABINET.VTHE TWO STAGE ENDING OF THE WAR AND DEMOBILIZATION,.MILITARY AND CIVIL.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio.THREE memoranda have recently been submitted to the War Cabinetdealing with problems which will arise&quot; if the War in Europe comes to an endappreciably before the collapse of Japan, two of these being by the Secretary ofState for India (W.P. (43) 223 and W.P. (43) 232), and the other by the Secretaryof State for War (W.P. (43) 239). In regard to the proposals in the last-mentionedmemorandum I would say first, that I entirely concur in the suggestion to recon-stitute the Interdepartmental Committee on the Machinery of Demobilizationwith a view to reference to it from time to time of demobilization problems, calling for interdepartmental discussion and advice.2. One of the problems which I am anxious that the Committee shouldreconsider at an early date, is that of the relative weight to be given to;,service at home and overseas. In its Report the Committee adopted the unanimous viewsof the Service Department representatives against attempting any discrimination between service in different countries. There are weighty arguments in favour ofthis course, but it has been called in question on several occasions since last autumn, the last being the Debate on the adjournment before the Easter recess,when I promised that the matter would be fully considered before any finaldecision was arrived at. As the Secretary of State for War says in his memor-andum, interest is being taken in this matter by a Parliamentary group. Ipropose to ask the Machinery of Demobilization Committee to reconsider it in thelight of later developments and to report to the Reconstruction ProblemsCommittee at an early  date.tj3. Whether or no it is found practicable to work out a satisfactory schemefor giving special weight to service in some or all foreign theatres of war, therecan be no doubt that the problem will be proportionately reduced by adopting thesuggestion of the Secretary of State for War, for such exchange of troops serving abroad for those at home as military and shipping considerations permit.4. The possible continuance of the War in the Far East after the collapse of Germany raises a much more difficult demobilization question. In his broad-cast of the 21st March, 1943, the Prime Minister, in discussing the probablecontinuance of the War in the Far East after its ending in Europe, stated:However vigorously the War against Japan is prosecuted there will certainly be a partial demobilization following the defeat of Hitler.&quot; It has been generally agreed throughout the official discussions on demobilization that military needs must be paramount and that the scheme of demobilization can onlyaPPty to those whose services are no longer required for military purposes. Nodoubt it will be possible to secure acceptance of this principle by the Forces andby the public generally as long as no great difference in the date of demobilizationis involved, but the continuance of the War for some considerable time in the far east may put a great strain on such acceptance. On military grounds it will-pro-bably be necessary to continue the fight against Japan very largely with troopswho are now out East and are already trained and acclimatised to local conditions,and it will hardly be possible to apply to them any partial demobilization schemeput into force at the end of the War in Europe. The proposal of the Secretary of[25554] . v-
State for War in regard to drafts-if it can be substantially carried out will do much to meet the hardest cases; for the rest it may be worth considering whether we can, with -the goodwill of employers, work out a scheme whereby these men could be given some assurance that a fair share of the more permanent positions in civil life would be available to them on their return, so that they might feel thattheir future prospects were not being prejudiced by the delay in theirdemobilization.5. Difficult as it may be to apply fairly a scheme of partial demobilization inthe military sphere, the problems which a two-stage ending of the War will createin civil demobilization are, if anything, still more difficult. Those in the armed forces will, at any rate, still be under military discipline and they can probablybe relied upon to accept a decision which obviously and honestly seeks to reconcileequity with military necessity. But far greater difficulties will arise in the civilsphere. The data are not yet available on which to make any clear forecast of the magnitude of these problems, but their general character can.be foreseen, and Irecently had the opportunity of discussing some of them with my ReconstructionJoint Advisory Council (comprising representatives of the Trades UnionCongress, the Federation of British Industries, and the British Employers&apos; Con-federation) ; the matter having been raised, in the Council, by the Federation ofBritish Industries..; 6. While certain forms of war production, notably shipbuilding, will need tobe carried on at full stretch after the collapse of Germany, it is inevitable that many other forms of war production should show a large decline of varyingdegree. No doubt the first step in adjusting productive capacity to reduceddemands in these spheres will be to cut out overtime, night shifts, Sundaywork, &amp;c, but there will be many branches of production in which the continuingneeds will only require the services of a fraction of those now engaged. Thequestion will then arise : should this production be concentrated on a number of firms wholly engaged on war work or should it be spread more or less evenly overthe whole section of industry concerned 1 In most cases the latter alternative would make for great inefficiency and greatly hamper the change-over to peace-time employment in that section of industry and under such conditions it must clearly be rejected, except possibly as a purely transitional measure.7. The concentration of production on a limited number of firms must,however, involve discrimination, both between firm and firm and between theirrespective employees. Many of the workers, especially women, are being held to their present employment under war-time powers, and their immediate release from all restriction on the signing of an Armistice with Germany might gravelydisorganise war production. On the other hand, the immediate cessation ofall Government orders to the firms not selected must give rise to considerable,if temporary, unemployment. After the tide of War had receded 10,000 milesit would be politically impossible, as well as manifestly absurd, to continue the compulsory retention of unwilling workers in the selected firms for any longer period than is essential to recruit voluntary workers to take their place. even this degree of extension of control will not be easy&apos;: it only needs a sufficient number of people to break a law at the same time for it to become a dead letter.In this, as in so many other problems of the period of partial demobilisation,:mucb will depend on the education of public opinion before the crisis develops.8. As regards those firms which are released from war work, problems will arise as to their share of materials in short supply, especially those materialsstill required for war production, and it is clear that war-time controls willhave to continue in such cases. Undue discrimination in regard to profits betweenfirms on war work and those to be released will no doubt be largely prevented by continuing the Excess Profits Tax, but this will not avoid the inequality of allowing some firms to get into the post-war market while others are still held to war work. On this ground, as well as on that of public requirements, it maybe &quot;necessary to continue a large measure of State control as to what these firmsshall manufacture, favouring, for example, the production of utility lines ofgoods.9.   The revival of the export trade under these twilight conditions willhave its own special problems, some of them involving international difficulties.Questions will arise as to the allocation of material between home and export- markets, as to the use of Lend-Lease material, &amp;c.
10. I have said enough, however, to indicate the gravity of the problems which will arise from this two-stage ending of the War. In order that further study may be given to them I would suggest that the Chiefs of Staff should beasked to make available, as far as this is possible, the anticipated requirements of personnel and material involved in the prosecution of the Far Eastern campaignafter the defeat of Germany. Thereafter, a joint committee of the production department, the Ministry of Labour and National Service, the Board of Trade,the Treasury and the Reconstruction Secretariat should consider the implications of these requirements on our industrial policy in this difficult peribd. It should further be a general direction to all departments in working out their reconstruc-tion proposals to give special attention to the bearing upon them of the probability of the War coming to an end in two distinct stages as indicated bythe Prime Minister.W.
