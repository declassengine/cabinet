THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty  &apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.secret.P. (43) 225.28th May, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 1943 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA. BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.CANADA is at present showing keen interest in plans for the post-war period. There is widespread discussion of the problem of preserving unity among/the Allied nations when the war is over, with particular reference to the questionof relations with Russia. Canada&apos;s part in plans for the solution of post-warproblems in connexion with world supplies and with relief schemes for thestricken countries of Europe is also being given consideration. The future ofcivil aviation is also under discussion, and it has been urged that Canada shouldstake out her claim in this field without waiting until the end of the war. TheBermuda Conference on plans for tackling the refugee problem aroused interest,and Canadian opinion seems to be in favour of an open-handed policy.2. At home the labour situation and man-power problems have been the chieftopics of discussion. The labour situation shows certain disquieting features : forinstance, although strikes are relatively few, the English press in Eastern canada is playing up isolated disputes in an effort to embarrass the Government and to-turn the public against the Unions. Pressure is also being exerted to increase theinfluence of the Roman Catholic Syndicates in Quebec, and this is likely to add to the trouble with the international Unions. The dispute over which mostemotion was generated was a strike of the Montreal tramways&apos; employees as aresult of various grievances over wage rates and Union recognition. Through the offices of a Government conciliator, the strike was settled after two days, but theGovernment has had unlimited abuse thrown at its head by the Conservative press for allowing a conciliator to effect a settlement in what was technically an illegalstrike. Another dispute, at the Arvida aluminium plant, was averted in the same way.3. The decision of the National War Labour Board on wages in the SteelIndustry has been published. The basic wage rate is to be 50 cents an hour, which means that, with the present cost-of-living bonus, the net wage will be 59 cents,but that, even if the cost-of-living index drops, the net wage is not to fall below55 cents. This is a significant ruling, establishing, as it does, a minimum wragefor an industry on a national basis.4. The National War Labour Board has announced, that it will shortlyconduct public hearings on matters relating to collective bargaining and condi-tions of employment, with a view to getting from labour and employeesconstructive suggestions for the overhaul of present conciliation machinery, andto seek ways of preserving industrial peace at the same time as maintaining the[25476] b ^Copy No.
wages ceiling policy. The hearings may well serve a useful purpose, and represent an important step forward in Government policy.5. The most pressing man-power problem is that of supplying adequateagricultural labour for this season. Various measures to supply the deficiencies,e.g., the formation of women&apos;s land armies and plans for using the services of school-children during holidays have been announced.6. Major-General Victor Odium, the first Canadian Minister to China, has arrived at Chungking, and Major-General G. P. Vanier, the newly-appointedMinister to several Allied Governments in England, has taken up his duties inLondon.7. Brigadier W. Foster, D.S.O., has been appointed a Special Commissionerfor defence projects in North-West Canada. His duties comprise the supervision and co-ordination of the activities of Canadian Departments dealing with thispart of Canada and liaison with all United States Government agencies in thearea.8. A delegation from Canada has arrived in this country to discuss plans for a war-time Transatlantic Air Service.Naval, Military and A ir A activities.9. At the recent Atlantic Convoy Conference in Washington it was agreedthat Canada would assume responsibility for the naval and air protection androuteing of North Atlantic trade convoys between the United States, Canada andthe United Kingdom, west of the Western Ocean Meeting Point.10. The Commanding Officer, Atlantic Coast, has now been appointedCommander-in-Chief, Canadian North-West Atlantic Approaches.11. The above arrangement for the transfer from the United States to canada of responsibility for trade convoys does not in any way affect the strategicresponsibility of the United States for the whole Western Atlantic area.These changes took effect on the 30th April.12. The activity of R.C.A.F. squadrons during April was slightly less thanin February and March owing to a spell of unfavourable weather. Losses werecomparatively heavy, 17 fighters and 54 bombers being reported missing. A newsquadron, No. 432, is to form on the 1st May and will be equipped with Wellingtonbombers.13. No. 403 Spitfire Squadron had a particularly successful month and claimed ten Focke Wulfs 190 destroyed. No. 405 Halifax Squadron is now engaged on &apos;&apos; pathfinder &apos;&apos; duties.14. No. 408 Halifax Squadron flew 646 hours of operational flying and lost12 aircraft. No. 413 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron is equipped withCatalinas and is stationed in Ceylon; no details of operations for April have beenreceived. No. 417 Spitfire Squadron was in action with the Eighth Army in tunisia. No. 419 Halifax Squadron flew 705 operational hours, from which fivecrews were reported missing. No. 425 French Canadian Squadron flew 688 opera-tional hours and lost five aircraft.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.General Position. ... -15. During April there was a general impression in Australia that the war situation in the Pacific was easier, and demands for more help were somewhat lessincessant. There is, however, still an undercurrent of criticism of the &quot; holdingwar &quot; policy, and a good deal of obscurity and some uneasiness in the public mindabout the real facts of the Pacific situation, owing to contradictory statementsabout the magnitude of the threat from Japan made by high officials in Washing-ton and in the South-West Pacific area. &quot;Grave warnings&quot; by AustralianService chiefs and Ministers about the massing of Japanese forces, were somewhatbelied by General MacArthur&apos;s perhaps over-encouraging communiques, and mostAustralian newspapers made reservations which suggest that they were not entirely convinced that the facts justify the fears expressed, and some of themsuggested that Japanese losses had been over-estimated. The visit to Washingtonof the Commonwealth Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Evatt, was expected to affect Pacific policy, and aroused hopes for more aid, particularly aeroplanes,
from the United States, and for greater offensive action against the Japanese. InDr. Evatt&apos;s opinion, the Japanese are a &quot;greater threat to the -European,Austral ian and American way of living than Germany.&quot; The Minister was, how-,ever, criticised by some newspapers on the ground that Australian claims had not-been too wisely expressed. The Minister took occasion to enlighten the american public about the Australian part in the fighting in the Pacific, by pointing outthat, on a population basis, the armed forces of the Commonwealth were equivalentto a United States army of 14 million.16. Mr. Wendell Willkie has been invited to visit Australia and his .pro-visional acceptance, subject to approval by the United States Government, wasreceived with pleasure.17. A split has taken place in the ranks of the United Australia party. TenSenators and seven members of the House of Representatives (including Mr.Menzies) have withdrawn from the meetings of the joint Opposition parties andhave formed a &quot; national service group.&quot; The new group calls for reorganisation of the United Australia party under new and vigorous leadership and, in a state-men t of policy, asked for &quot; loyalty to the British Commonwealth and greaterappreciation of the war effort of Great Britain.&quot; Most members of the grouphave been consistent advocates of Right-wing opinion and, while it has had some support from the press, from other quarters it has been regarded simply as a move to restore a greater measure of political leadership to Mr. Menzies. The secedingmembers were sharply attacked by Mr.-Hughes, the present leader of the UnitedAustralia party.18. A new Food Executive has been appointed to deal with the problem ofSupplies for the Pacific and, in conjunction with New Zealand, for the UnitedKingdom.19. Industrial troubles in Australia are grave. Coal mine stoppages andstrikes in vital war industries are common, and on one day recently 67,000 workersin various industries were said to be idle. The press strongly supported the recentaction of the Prime Minister, who ordered the use of military personnel to &quot; keepships moving&quot; by taking the places of dockers who were on strike. Althoughmore men are employed on the wharves than the amount of work necessitates,labour is often unobtainable except at times when penalty rates of pay are inoperation. The Government appears either unwilling, or unable, to take effective action to remedy the unsatisfactory labour situation, and public opinion is becoming increasingly outspoken in its demands for a stronger line to be taken.Naval, Military and Air Activities.20. H.M.A.S. Stawell (minesweeper) was launched on the 3rd. H.M.A.S.Nambucca (auxiliary minesweeping vessel) was paid off on the 19th.21. In consequence of the recent military reorganisation referred to in thelast report, Australian military forces in Australia are now in course of beingdisposed as follows :  - -New Guinea. Three jungle divisions for holding areas of strategic importance and to provide a small force for reinforcing such areas or other points as may be threatened.Queensland. Torres Strait and Merauke forces. One armoured division and three jungle divisions are en route or in training.Darwin. One infantry division and ancillary units.Western Aiistralia.-One infantry division, one armoured division and ancillary units.New South Wales. One infantry division (mainly under age personnel)and ancillary units, one armoured brigade group and one armoured tankbrigade.22. The names of 2,266 Australian personnel held as prisoners of war byJapanese have been received through the International Red Cross Committee atGeneva. Of,these, 1,300 are reported to be in Borneo, 775 in Malaya and theremainder in Japan, Korea and Formosa.23. At the end of April, there were 154,518 United States forces inAustralia, of which 108,935 were ground troops.[25476]: b 2
Economic and Financial.24. The third Australian Liberty Loan of  A. 100 million has been fullysubscribed. The terms offered were 2\ per cent, for five-year bonds andper cent, for sixteen-year bonds. This loan brings the total of new moneysubscribed to public loans this financial year up to about  A. 183 million. nine months ago, when the deficit on the Commonwealth Budget for the current financial year was estimated at  A. 300 million, the Commonwealth Treasurerset a target of  A. 240 million as the amount to be raised by the end of Junefrom public loans. Revised estimates have recently been made showing that thetotal deficit is likely to be  A. 390 million. It appears, therefore, that theTreasurers hopes of avoiding a large increase in the floating debt are likelyto be disappointed.NEW ZEALAND.General Position.25. There is no echo in New Zealand of Australian suggestions that the pacific theatre of war is being neglected, and Australian demands to the UnitedStates for more aeroplanes tend to be regarded as importunate. Furtheroffensive action against the Japanese would, however, be greatly welcomed.Statements made by Mr. Walter Nash, the New Zealand Minister in Washington,have helped to strengthen the opinion that Allied efforts made against theJapanese at the present time amount to something more than a &quot; holding war,&quot;but the public is perplexed about the Pacific situation as a whole, owing to thedifferent presentation of affairs in General MacArthur&apos;s communiques, and inofficial statements from Washington.26. There has been a cooling recently in the attitude of New Zealand tothe United States. Stories of bad relations between United States and NewZealand troops have been current, while the methods of the United States NavalCensorship have been adversely criticised. Because of mistrust for themonopolistic character of United States business methods, the New Zealand MeatBoard has passed a resolution expressing &apos;&apos; perturbation &apos;&apos; at the possibility ofan American company acquiring control of leading meat works. The &quot; Christ-church Press &quot; expressed the view that the attitude of the United Kingdomtowards the Fighting French had cooled as a result of United States influence.27. At home, a certain amount of labour trouble is occurring, e.g., whenUnited States troops were called in to unload United States ships, owing to the refusal of Auckland dockers to do the job in the rain.28. Mr. Jones, Minister of Defence, has stated that one-tenth of NewZealand&apos;s population, numbering 160,000, is now mobilised in the forces. Interesthas been aroused by the arrangements which have been made to enable all Servicemen and women to vote at the general election, which is expected to take place,later this year, irrespective of whether or not they have reached the age of 21.29. A curious incident took place at the funeral of-Mr. Paikea, the lateMinister for the Maori war effort, when the Prime Minister, Mr. Eraser, tookexception to a Maori leader&apos;s statement that the Maori people &quot; definitelywished &quot; any additional troops sent overseas to be directed to North Africa, andnot to the Pacific theatre. After a heated exchange, the incident closed whenthe participants in the dispute shook hands before the Maori assembly.30. Mr. L. W. Brockington&apos;s visit to New Zealand is reported by theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner to have been very successful. Mr. Brock-ington made a great impression by his speeches, broadcast talks, and interviews,on both the Government and the general public.Naval, Military and Air Activities.31.   H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles is undergoing refit in United Kingdom.32. H.M.N.Z.S. Leander is operating under Commander, South pacific area.     . .33. At the start of the month the 2nd New Zealand Division was with the eighth Army in touch with the enemy holding the Wadi Akarit position. the eighth Army attacked at 4-15 a.m. on 6th in complete darkness : this attack was completely successful, all main objectives being captured by 11 a.m. The2nd New Zealand Division was thus able to be passed through at the head of
the 10th Corps the same morning. In spite of heavy fighting and determinedcounter-attacks, the enemy was forced to withdraw northwards, followed up bythe 10th Corps, with the 30th Corps on its right astride the Gabes-Sfax road.By the 9th leading elements of the New Zealand Division had reached La Hencha,between Sfax and El Djem, an advance of between 80 and 100 miles. FromEl Djem the left column was directed north-westwards upon Kairouan, leaving the main column to capture Sousse on the 10th. The pursuit of the enemycontinued until our patrols came up against a definite defensive position on the approximate line Enfidaville-Djebibina. Although Enfidaville itself was captured on the 19th, operations of Eighth Army, including 2nd New Zealand division, now became more or less stabilised while preparations were goingforward for the operations leading up to the final offensive by the whole18th Army Group.34.   New Zealand forces in the Pacific are now disposed as follows : New Caledonia. One division of three infantry brigades and thefollowing divisional troops : a field regiment, a heavy regiment, a light?anti-aircraft regiment, a heavy anti-aircraft regiment, two anti-tankbatteries, two field companies; ancillary services. Total New Zealandpersonnel 14,367.Tonga. Local defence force is now one brigade group, of whichNew Zealand has provided command and staff, also key personnel for : afield battery, a heavy anti-aircraft battery, two light anti-aircraft batteries,two heavy coast batteries, one works service maintenance section, two Tonganinfantry battalions; ancillary services.  Total New Zealand personnel 18,000.Norfolk Island. The garrison comprises New Zealand Home defence units, namely, one infantry regiment (less two rifle companies), one heavybattery, one composite anti-aircraft battery, one troop of field artillery, oneworks service maintenance section, one section field company, ancillary services.   Total New Zealand personnel 1,430.Fiji. Local defence force consists of one brigade group, for whichNew Zealand has provided command and key personnel; also two anti-aircraft batteries to be relieved: by United States forces. Total New Zealandpersonnel 1,600.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.General Position.35. A General Election will be held in July. Parliament has now risen,and members are devoting time to electoral preparations. On the Governmentside the Labour Party have entered into an arrangement with the United Partyby which the latter will give Labour a clear field in 10 constituencies. SomeLeft-wing members of the Labour Party, however, disapproved of this arrange1ment, and intend to stand as Independent Labour candidates. The Governmentis, however, fairly Confident that it will maintain, and even increase, its presentmajority. The Opposition parties continue their manoeuvres in the hope forming a united front against the Government, but, so far, their efforts have not met with much success. Mr. Pirow and his New Order group announced that&quot; in the interests of Afrikaner Unity &quot; they would withdraw their candidatesand throw their weight into the struggle against &quot;Smuts and Communism.&quot;DrJ Malan, the Nationalist leader, welcomed the announcement as an earnest of support for the Nationalist Party, but it is by no means certain that theNationalist Party will benefit. Mr. Pirow has made the support of his New Ordergroup conditional upon the Nationalist ^Party reaching agreement with both theAfrikaner Party and the Ossewa Brandwag and to this Dr. Malan so far refusesto commit his Party. *&apos;36. The Nationalist Party&apos;s attitude to Jews has been laid down. Itexcludes Jews from membership, demands immediate cessation of Jewishnaturalisation or immigration, and declares that all &apos;&apos; undesirable or illegal&apos;&apos;Jewish immigrants will be repatriated to their countries of origin. It alsoenvisages the institution of vocational quotas. These evidences of anti-Semitismhave no doubt been partly responsible for the resurgence in the Union of the zionist agitation for Palestine       Jewish State37. It is reported in the press that a new system, under which soldiers willvote.for parties instead of individuals, may be instituted at the forthcomingelection. The diverse.origins of the troops, it is explained, makes the normalsystem of balloting impossible.
38. The Union Government has decided on large increases in army pay..on the recommendation of the Select Committee. These are widely regarded as asop to the electorate with an eye on the pending election, and the Natives&apos;representatives are strongly attacking the Government on account of thedisproportionately low increases given to natives in the army.39. A Cape Coloured Permanent Commission has been set up by theGovernment, ostensibly as &quot; a means of getting a closer exchange of views betweenthe Government and the coloured community.&quot; The Cape coloured people,handicapped by their mixed racial origin, which combines European, Hottentot&apos;and Malay elements in varying proportions, have long struggled, amidstconditions of social and economic backwardness, to assert superiority over the&quot; native &quot; community and to approximate more nearly to a white standard ofliving. They are bitterly opposed to the establishment of the new Commission;which they regard as yet another measure of racial discrimination, which, they say, has been increasing in recent years.40. The Governments legislation to peg the question of the acquisition byBritish Indians of real estate in European urban areas (chiefly in Natal), until a judicial Commission had reported, has led to discussion of the wider question ofthe status of British Indians in the Union. They were originally introduced inorder to save the sugar industry. They settled and prospered, and the time isnow approaching when it must be decided whether they are to be looked upon asan integral part of the South African nation, with a share in representative government, or what alternative prospect is open for them. The question hasbeen discussed in the press with a surprising lack of prejudice. Much of the blame for the present position was laid on the Government, and also on theDurban City Council, as no adequate arrangements or facilities, e.g., in housing,had been made for the development of the Indian community. It is evidentlyrealised that the present legislation is no more than a temporary palliative, andthat it will be necessary to evolve a constructive long-range policy if the content-ment and progress of Indians in the Union is to be secured. The Oppositionpress exploited to the utmost the division of opinion in the Government ranksover the interim measure, and have been swift to point out the &quot; dangers to theUnion &quot; of &quot; British liberal ideas.&quot; In these and in other quarters, suggestionsappeared that the position should be dealt with without reference to possibleBritish embarrassments in India, though regret was expressed by the pro-Govern-ment press that the question should ever have been allowed to develop into a major political issue in time of war. The Labour Party criticised theGovernment Bill on the ground that it was a &apos;&apos; purely racial measure which might lead to unfortunate precedents in the history of discrimination.&quot; The discussionswithin the Cabinet over the proposed legislation led to the resignation ofMr. Hofmeyr, the Minister of Finance. He was induced to reconsider this, but his position has since remained somewhat ambiguous.41. The Prime Minister, in a speech in Parliament on the 7th April, saidthat volunteering for service outside Africa was going on quite well, but it would always be necessary to keep large forces inside Africa. South Africa was in thewar to the end, because only when final victory was won would South Africabe safe. &quot;It was no good dreaming of peace when so much remained to bedone. The end of the war might be sudden, but he (General Smuts) thoughtthat it would probably go on until the end of next year.&quot; He then praised the lease-Lend arrangements with America, which he characterised as a&quot;magnificent gesture which had made possible many things which would otherwise have been impossible.&quot;The Union High Commissioner in London, Colonel Reitz, in a speech at birmingham on the 15th April, praised British achievements in South Africa inthese phrases : &quot;Asa South African Dutchman, I have suffered from your faults,but I have also benefited by your virtues. I have found the British, with all theirfaults, the fairest-minded, the most generous, and the most just nation in theworld. In South Africa we are as free as any country, thanks to Britishgenerosity.&quot;NEWFOUNDLAND.42. It has been announced in the House of Commons that arrangements were being made for a small Mission, composed of three Members of the House(Mr. C. G. Ammon, Sir Derrick Gunston and Mr. A. P. Herbert), to visitNewfoundland during the summer.   It was explained, in making the announce-
merit, that war conditions make any formal enquiry into the Island&apos;s future constitution inappropriate at the present time, and that the Mission would not-be a formal body charged with a specific enquiry, constitutional or otherwise. Itwas felt, however, that such a Mission would be valuable both in order to make available to Parliament fuller knowledge of Newfoundlands Avar effort and of theproblems likely to face the Island after the war, and also to give theNewfoundlanders a first-hand picture of the war effort of this country.43. The budget for the new financial year in Newfoundland, commencingthe 1st . April, provides for a revenue of approximately $22,180,000 andexpenditure of $20,510,000. For the shortened financial year of 9 months ended the 31st March a surplus of $3,681,000 was secured, as compared with theoriginal estimate of $848,500. This result was mainly due to the continuedincrease in the customs revenue, which it had been thought desirable toestimate conservatively. The surplus which has been accumulated during the past three years amounts to about $11^ million, a sum approximating to the normalrevenue of the Island in the years immediately prior to the war.EIRE... 44. Speaking at a meeting of the National Planning Conference held atthe Mansion House, Dublin, at the beginning of April, Mr. de Valera promised that the Eire Government would do everything possible to make rural life more attractive and to keep the people on the land. Although the Government was doing its own planning, it was of tremendous value that there should be a bodylike the National Planning Conference considering these plans. The State ought not to interfere more than was necessary. The Government regretted every timethe State had to interfere.45. Cardinal MacRory, speaking at the Cathedral Chapter of ClogherDiocese on the 5th April, said : &quot;I regard the division of one country by another.as an intolerable injustice, and in Ireland&apos;s case this injustice is heightened bythe fact that it followed upon centuries of confiscation and persecution. Partitionseems intended to keep our people divided into something like two hostile camps,and this is the aspect of it that I most dislike.&quot; Continuing, the Cardinal said :&quot; The Atlantic Charter gives a solemn undertaking, which, in case the Allieswin the war, should be certain to bring partition in Ireland, to a speedy end.The. undertaking is given in the third point of the Atlantic Charter and runs asfollows : &apos; Third, they respect the right of all people to choose the form ofgovernment under which they will live.&apos; .Now, if Ireland is free to choose herform of government, it is quite certain that she will chose not provincial orsectional government, but a central and national government for the entirecountry, and, no matter how you understand the phrase &apos; form of government,&apos;this undertaking of the Atlantic Charter would be a fraud if, in spite of it, thepeople of any country could still be obliged to live under governmental conditionswhich they abhor. What would happen to us in the event of an Axis victoryI; cannot, of course, say, but I have hopes that&apos;they would see the folly andabsurdity of dividing or partitioning a small island like ours, made by one God.&apos;&apos;46. Mr. Grant, the Northern Ireland Minister of Public Security, said, inreply to Cardinal MacRory in Belfast on the 7th April, that the Cardinal forgotthat Northern Ireland was a small country and was entitled to the rights andliberties secured under the. Charter, and to remain a member of theCommonwealth.47. Dr. 0&apos;Higgins said in a public speech oh the 18th April that the policy&apos;6f Fine &apos; Gael was that &apos;&apos; our position as a free country, associated with theCommonwealth through a common link, gave us all the national advantages of independence, and all the material advantages of association; that only oneParliament, the Dail, could make laws, and only one Army, under Parliament,could function; and that British trade and markets were vital to our people.&quot;48. A deficit is shown of  3,317,482 in. the Eire exchequer figures for theyear ending the.31st March, 1943. Revenue was  39,728,364 and expenditure 43,045,846. Compared with the previous year, revenue showed an increase of 2,748,705 and expenditure was up by  2,421,279.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.49. No political developments of major significance occurred during April.But while nothing occurred to revive the fortunes and prestige of the congress party, the influence of the Moslem League was obviously growing. Late in themonth the Governor of Bengal was able to cancel the Proclamation which hehad issued less than four weeks earlier on the resignation of the Huq ministry,taking the administration into his own hands. Ministerial Government was resumed under a Ministry formed by Sir Khwaja Nazim-ud-din, the local moslem league leader. The Ministry is a coalition, as is inevitable in Bengal, but the predominant party is Moslem Leagjie. Three Moslem League Premiers are nowin office, in Bengal, Assam and Sind, and with a considerable influence in the punjab Ministry the League has a weight which it did not previously possess. Itheld an impressive session its thirtieth on the 24th April in Delhi. Mr. Jinnahmade a lengthy speech, in which he offered to settle with Mr. Gandhi at theprice of Pakistan; &apos;&apos; Why should not the country say, Unite and drive the Britishout?&quot;50. Public opinion on the progress of the war was steady on the whole,and Mr. Churchill&apos;s tribute to the exploits of the 4th Indian Division in Tunisiawas warmly appreciated. But the failure of the campaign in Burma and theJapanese air activity in South-Eastern Bengal caused renewed expectation of invasion and doubt of India&apos;s ability to resist it. High feeling was excited bythe enactment of legislation in South Africa to check the acquisition of propertyby Indians in Durban and the Transvaal, which dealt a serious blow to faith inthe professions of the United Nations.Indian States.51.-&apos; An important announcement during April of a scheme for the mergerof the smaller States in Western India had a generally favourable reception.Some 400 petty States are effected by the scheme which provides for their attach-ment to Baroda and five other of the larger States for administrative purposes.It had long been felt that the traditional policy of treating as independent unitsthese numerous petty States which emerged at the beginning of the 19th Centuryfrom the collapse of the Mahratta power in western India was out of conformitywith modern conditions, and that these little territories could not satisfy the finaltest of the fitness of any State to survive its capacity to secure the welfare of itsown subjects. The attached States will benefit from the resources and adminis-trative efficiency of the foster States; for the time being they will preservenominally their separate identity, but their ultimate end, unless the scheme beliesexpectations, will undoubtedly be complete absorption into the larger State.52. Communal disturbances, from which British India has enjoyed formany months an unexpected and welcome freedom, occurred in three Statesduring the month, and a serious food riot in Hyderabad resulted in firing and five deaths. Apart from these and from some minor incidents of sabotage themonth has been generally quiet.External and Frontier relations report.53. Afghanistan, Sir Francis Wylie had an interview with the PrimeMinister, at which he explained that His Majesty&apos;.s Government proposed towithdraw him from Kabul about June next and&apos;to replace him by Mr. G. F.Squire, who is at present serving as Counsellor in the Tehran Legation. ThePrime Minister very courteously expressed his regret at Sir Francis Wylie&apos;stransfer and his willingness to welcome Mr. Squire as his successor. The reasonfor this somewhat early change of Minister is the desirability of making availableto the new Viceroy when he arrives Sir Francis Wylie&apos;s experienced services as political Adviser.The main event of importance in Afghanistan during the month was the arrest by the Afghan Government both in Kabul and in the north of the country of about 100 emigres from Russian Turkistan who had been engaged in an anti-Soviet conspiracy organised and directed by the German Legation in Kabul. Thechief local agent in the plot was one Tirazi, an official in the King&apos;s Secretariat,and he, with his son, was among those arrested. Tirazi was also in touch witha group of Bokhara emigres in Delhi, and it is clear that this branch of the
organisation was directed against ourselves. There has also been intensifiedGerman intrigue on the Indian frontier. It is not clear whether Afghan action was prompted by Russian pressure, but on the whole it seems improbable. Thequestion whether any intervention by His Majesty&apos;s Government is now desirableis under consideration..54. The no. 7&quot;th-West Frontier. The North-West Frontier has been quietexcept for occasional raids in the settled districts by gangs of bad characters andthe usual Spring seasonal increase in sniping and other incidents in Waziristan,which is widely attributed locally to the receipt by the Faqir of Ipi of a freshsubvention from the Axis. There were indications that the Faqir was planning to raise a Lashkar to operate in the Shaktu area. Political pressure havingfailed, it was necessary to take air action in a selected area of Bhittani tribalterritory in order to secure the release of two officials kidnapped by a Bhittanigang on the 1st April.The Viceroy, during a tour of the frontier, visited the headquarters of NorthWaziristan. He was presented by tribal leaders with a purse of money for the wounded and prisoners of war, and was assured that in spite of recent lapsesthe tribes were at heart friends of Government.55. Tibet. The Government of India found it necessary to draw theattention of the Tibetan Government to the fact that their officers had beenencroaching over the agreed frontier (the McMahon Line) between India andTibet in the Tawang area, and to protest against their activities. It was reportedthat a Tibetan military officer of high rank, accompanied by Tibetan troops, had arrived in Tawang, that he had summoned residents from British villages to appear before him, and that he had been attempting to collect revenue from thesevillagers. The Government of India asked for an assurance that the Tibetan officer and troops would be at once withdrawn from the Tawang area south of the border.The Tibetan reply has not yet been received. In view of these troublesomeencroachments which have been going on for some time, the Government of india have been considering the desirability of taking steps to render the McMahon line the effective frontier with Tibet by permanent occupation of focal points in theunadministered territory between Assam and the McMahon Line. As China isalso interested in view of her claim to suzerainty over Tibet, and has neverrecognised the McMahon Line, the Government of India feel that there wouldbe advantage in coming to a definite settlement of the Indo-Tibetan frontier inadvance of the peace settlement.The Tibetan Government, in the absence of any further progress with thepack transport negotiations for supplies to China, apparently in March held upall goods for China, whether consigned to the Chinese Government or not. Theywere advised to permit passage of all civil supplies for China so long as theChinese Government refrained from sending inspectors or communication experts to Tibet, and a recent letter received from them reported that orders to that effect had been issued. Meanwhile, there were signs of Chinese exasperation at what they considered to be Tibetan intransigence in this matter, and Lhasabecame alarmed by reports of concentrations of Chinese troops on their border.The Tibetan Government have now sent a note to our representative in Lhasain which, after drawing attention to reports that Chinese troops have arrived on the border with most aggressive intentions, they request that their great Ally,the British Government, through the Government of India, will render themevery possible assistance to uphold and maintain their independence. It isproposed as a first step to approach the Chinese Government with a request thatthey will confirm our assumption that there is no foundation for these rumours of Chinese troops being concentrated against Tibet.56. China. The Viceroy drew attention to statements made to press correspondents in the United States by Mme. Chiang Kai-Shek in which, after-eferences to the problem of India&apos;s constitutional development, she expressedher opinion that Nehru ought to be released. The Viceroy asked that theimpropriety of such intervention in the internal business of a foreign and Alliedcountry by a person in Madame&apos;s position should be brought to the notice of theChinese Government and Lord Halifax has spoken informally to Mr. T. V. Soongon the subject.57.   Nepal. The Nepalese Government rejected out of hand the scheme fora Customs union with India which was explained to them in broad outline by-Sir Alan Lloyd, who the Government of India had sent to discuss the matter with the Nepalese at Katmandu..  It was clear that their objective was to obtain&apos;[25476] . c
a formal agreement securing the maintenance of the status quo on the Indo- &apos;Nepalese frontier as a guarantee against possible unfavourable treatment bythe future Government of India following upon constitutional changes in thatcountry. Sir Alan Lloyd explained to them the difficulty that the Governmentof India would experience in conceding a permanent safeguard of this naturewithout violating their international obligations and without attracting the critical scrutiny of the Indian legislature. It is hoped that his explanation onthese points may have had some effect.The Maharaja sent a message to the Prime Minister expressing his gratifica-tion at the appreciative mention of the services rendered by Gurkha troopsincluded in the Prime Ministers message to the Indian Army.58. United States. Mr. Phillips has been recalled to Washington toreport to the President. In farewell discussions with the Viceroy, he made itclear that he favoured some interim solution of the constitutional problem, though he admitted the difficulties involved, on which the Viceroy laid stress. before leaving India he stated, in reply to a question by -the Press, that he had approached the proper authority for permission to see Mr. Gandhi, but had failed to obtain that permission.A somewhat embarrassing request has been made by the american ambassador in this country for the appointment of an American Consul toBahrein, in view of the considerable American interests represented by the oil company operating in that State. To admit a foreign Consul in Bahrein would open the door to similar appointments by other Powers both in Bahrein and inother Gulf States, and might seriously undermine our whole position in thePersian Gulf.Finance.59. Indmn Budget. The Indian Budget proposals for 1943-44 wTeresummarised in the Report for February 1943. The proposals, with oneunimportant change, have been duly passed by the Indian Legislature.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.60.   R.I.N. The following vessels were due to be completed in India during march, 1943-One trawler (Basset).One 105&apos; M.M.S.Four fair miles.Two 72&quot; MLs. r-.- 61. Military. The 4th Indian Division distinguished itself by the part itplayed in the 8th Army&apos;s successful operations against the Mareth Line and theAkarit position. Tribute to its work was paid in a congratulatory telegramfrom the Prime Minister to his Excellency the Viceroy.Our forces in the Mayu Peninsula have been gradually withdrawn to positionsSouth of the line Maungdaw-Buthidaung. The enemy, having regrouped their forces, attacked our forward positions, but with only limited success. Theysustained fairly heavy casualties and our main positions remained unchanged.Attempts by enemy patrols to infiltrate into and round our positions continue.On the Upper Chindwin Japanese activity has revived after a lull of somemonths. Our positions on the West bank have been shelled from South ofHomalin, but no attempt to cross the river has yet been made.Patrol encounters have continued in the Chin Hills. There has been noimportant change in the Myitkyina area.62.   Air. The increased -merny air activity mentioned last month continuedup to mid-April.   Since when it has declined very considerably.   This enemy activity accomplished little except to draw back a proportion of our fighters tc; )defend airfields.   R.A.F. claim enemy aircraft losses to the 10th April to be Destroyed 6, Probably destroyed 15, Damaged 34../The RAP. have operated continuously in support of the troops in Arakanand in defence of airfields. In addition R.A.F. light bombers and bombers of theUnited States Air Force have continued their attacks on enemy airfields, supplydumps and communications. The port of Rangoon wras heavily raided on several occasions and its use has been practically denied to the enemy during the month.Six power launches full of tx-troops were sunk off Ramsee Island.
General.63. A further reorganisation of the Eastern Army area has been carriedout. It has been divided into three areas, each commanded by a Major-General.These areas correspond with the Provinces of Bengal, Assam and Bihar andOrissa.64. Direct telephone and teleprinter services were opened during April toBombay and Bangalore. A military telegraph line has been opened between general Headquarters New Delhi and General Headquarters Simla.65. A small Public Liaison section with a staff of six officers has been created in the Directorate of Public Relations. Its object is by personal contact and oralpublicity, to foster friendship and mutual relations between the public and thefighting&quot; forces, and, from a military point of view, to assist, where possible, thecivil authorities in developing support among the public for India&apos;s war effort.It is hoped, through the medium of Public Liaison to bring about goodwill, under-standing and fuller co-operation between Indians of all creeds and classes, and thereby gain for the United Nations an enhanced war effort from India.66. The Section is at present concentrating its efforts in Assam. its activities will be reviewed at a later date with a view to further expanding thisscheme or otherwise.67. A Christmas gift scheme for British troops similar to one introducedlast year was repeated and was a success. Under this scheme all British troopsin Ceylon, Eastern Army, and the forward areas of Southern Army received a(suitable gift at Christmas.   A similar scheme was run for Indian troops.68. Local entertainments for British troops are being encouraged as muchas possible. Funds to finance such projects are at the disposal of Commands andArmies. As this has proved inadequate for the increasing numbers of Britishtroops, four concert parties are being raised by General Headquarters.69. The issue of Fortnightly Welfare Education and Current Affairspamphlets to British units has been commenced. Discussions groups, locallectures, hobbies and handicrafts and visits, to local places of interest are being implemented in all British units.   The necessary finance is being made available.70. Morale among both British and Indian troops continues to be generallygood. The improved political situation, which has relieved practically all field army troops from internal security duties and has, consequently, permitted a return to normal training, has-been welcomed. The introduction of Informationrooms, where the fortunes of the war on all fronts are closely followed and dis-cussed, has been most successful in many units. This shows that the Indian soldiertakes considerably more interest in the progress of the war than was perhaps atone time realised. Congress activities, including efforts to undermine discipline,have had very little effect upon Indian troops, whose &quot;grouses&quot; are mainlyeconomic. Shortage of staple commodities, which exert their most marked effecton the families of Indian troops, cause concern. There is universal bitternessagainst profiteers.71. Service in India cannot be described as popular amongst British troops.Both officers and men are beginning to think about their future prospects in civilian life and to weigh up their chances of demobilisation after the war.The situation in the East after the last war is remembered, when those held upbelieved they were worse off than their comrades serving in other theatres. Thetendency to regard Germany as the main enemy, and the belief that Germany willbe beaten before Japan are factors which probably influence the outlook of many men.72. To understand the British soldiers&apos; feeling towards Service inIndia it must be appreciated that the attitude of the Indian urban population is hardly calculated to make him enthusiastic about their defence, and that hehas nowadays to compete with more highly-paid American troops for a share inthe few &quot; bright lights &quot; which an. Indian city offers for his entertainment.73. The Chinese Forces under training in India consist of 10,000 whichwithdrew from Burma and 26,o00 that have been flown in from China. Thepresent strength is 34,000, 2,000 having become non-effective i through beino-evacuated back to China, death, &amp;c. 0 tof25476] . c 2
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occupied Burma.74. A Vichy broadcast in Annamite stated that during his recent visit to japan Ba Maw signed a Pact with Tojo, providing for economic and military co-operation-operation and a Japanese guarantee of Burma&apos;s independence.75. Ba Maw celebrated his return from Tokyo by making a speech at a NewYear Rally of the Dobama Sinyetha party. His speech made the familiarexpressions of gratitude to Japan and called for unity from all Burmans.76. The Japanese are setting up a &quot; Public Relations Service &quot; under whicha census of the population will be taken, and anyone wishing to move his residencemust beforehand report his name, religion and his reasons for the move.77. In a broacast in English from Tokyo on the 25th March Tojo announcedthat the Shan States and Karen areas will be excluded from independent Burma.Frontier Administration.78. The Japanese still hold Sumprabum in the Northern Myitkyina area and were last reported operating some 16 miles north of that place. In the ChinHills the supply problem is still acute, but within the limitations of transport,rice and salt are being brought in, to tide the population over the monsoon months.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.-(Note. Jn this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.79. The food situation in a number of Colonial territories, more particu-larly Ceylon, Mauritius, Seychelles, East Africa and Northern Rhodesia, hascontinued to be closely watched.Ceylon.80. The Government of India agreed to the diversion to Ceylon of a steamercarrying a cargo of bulk wheat for India, and this vessel has now arrived. TheGovernment of India have also agreed that a steamer which was to take a cargo of wheat for India from Australia should load there for Ceylon instead, and theship is now loading.81. These two shipments, together wdth two cargoes of flour in the shipsdiverted from the United Kingdom programme, which were mentioned in lastmonth&apos;s report, and the consignments of rice from Egypt, the first of which arenow expected to arrive early in May, wall meet the immediate situation. It isessential, however, that the arrangements for meeting Ceylon&apos;s requirements should be put on to a more stable and lasting basis as soon as possible, and at my request the Secretary of State for India has telegraphed to the Viceroy to ask whether, in view of the more favourable food situation in India, the Governmentof India could again make themselves responsible for meeting Ceylon&apos;s needsWhatever may be ultimately decided, it still remains desirable that CeylonVreserves should be built up to a level which will give time for alternative arrange-ments to be made should supplies from one particular source fail.East Africa.82. Against the 46,000 tons representing the civilian and Service cerealimport requirements for the three months March, April and May, approximately34,000 tons have so far arrived or are in transit, and it is hoped that the balancewill be met by additional supplies of manioc starch, tapioca and beans fromMadagascar.
83. Although final information is not yet available, the latest reports*which I have received from the Chairman of the Governors&apos; Conference indicatethat there may be a partial failure of the main rains in certain areas of EastAfrica, with a consequential adverse effect on the coming harvest. In view ofthis it is important that reserves should be built up, and the position generallymust continue to give cause for some anxiety. The final arrangements. for thesecond charter of the Swedish ship to carry a further cargo of maize or wheat from the Argentine still await the sanction of the Swedish Government, but itis hoped that this will.be obtained very soon. I have received information also from the Governor of Northern Rhodesia that 4,000 tons of maize may be availablein May-June in Lourenco Marques, and it has been suggested to East Africa thatthey should endeavour to secure these supplies. It is also hoped that some maizemay be available from&apos; Madagascar and Ethiopia, but further information isawaited as to the quantities likely to be available for export.84. As stated in the following paragraph, we were disappointed in ourhopes of obtaining Angola maize for East Africa, and such maize as isimmediately available in Angola will be taken by Northern Rhodesia.Northern Rhodesia.85. The local maize crop is expected to become available at the end of June,and it was hoped that the position would be met without difficulty in the mean-time by supplies of maize from the Congo and also Angola. Unfortunately, thequantity of Congo maize available is less than was expected; about 6,500 tons havealready been received, and a recent telegram indicates the possibility of a further,000 tons. As regards Angola, it was hoped some time ago that up to 10,000 tons would be available at once, but the latest reports show that only 3,000 tons areimmediately available, and of these 2,000 tons may be taken by Southern Rhodesia.The Northern Rhodesian Government are taking steps to secure maximumsupplies from Angola, and it is hoped that further quantities.will soon be available from that source as the new crop comes in. The position in Northern Rhodesiamust, however, be closely watched until its own crops become available.Mauritius.86. The steamer from Australia carrying 6,500 tons of flour is now expectedto reach Mauritius early in May, and, subject to her safe arrival, requirements will be met up to the middle of June. It has now been agreed that, in order tomaintain supplies, a further cargo of flour should be loaded in Australia forMauritius as early as possible in May, and 3,000 tons of manioc starch are alsodue to be shipped from Madagascar.Seychelles.87. Subject to the safe arrival of the 1,000 tons of flour from Australiareferred to in last month&apos;s report, the position will be assured until August and,in addition, about 600. tons of composite meal are being obtained from EastAfrica.Defence.Mauritius.88. With reference to paragraph 106 of the report for February, approvalhas now been given to the transfer of the Mauritius military forces to the adminis-trative and financial control of the War Office. The Mauritius Regiment (the newtitle under which the Territorial Force is being reorganised) was established by defence Regulations on the 22nd April and placed under War Office control by a, (Tel. 412 frcproclamation dated the 24th April. It is intended that the transfer shall be given Mauritius),retrospective effect from the 1st July, 1942, by the enactment of an ordinancewhich will also enable the force, if required, to operate under local law outsidethe Colony. As from the effective date of transfer the Colony will pay a blocksum of Rs. 4,083,000 a year, for two.years, in the first instance, to the imperial exchequer as its contribution towards the cost of military defence.Fiji.89. Steps have recently been taken in accordance with the Colonial naval defence Act, 1931, to place the personnel and vessels of the Fiji Naval Volunteer* A later telegram from Nairobi, dated 2nd May, indicates that crop prospects are definitelybetter as a result of the favourable development of monsoon conditions.
Force at the:disposal of His Majesty for general service in the Royal Navy. Theforce, which now becomes the Fiji R.N.V.R., was established in 1939 and has a present strength of approximately 340, made up of Europeans and Fijians. Itis engaged on the manning of local patrol launches and is responsible for thesecurity of ships in Suva Harbour. It also provides most of the complement ofH.M.S. Viti. The Admiralty intend that the force shall continue to discharge itspresent functions, and have arranged with the New Zealand Naval Board that thelatter shall exercise operational control and administrative responsibility in.respect of the force on their behalf.West Indies.90. The Governors of some of the Colonies have been asked by the localUnited States Commanders whether there would be any objection to replacement of United States white troops in the Bases by Puerto Ricans. The Governor ofJamaica has. reported that this would be strongly resented by the local popula-tion, especially as there is no intention of withdrawing United States whitetroops from Puerto Rico and entrusting Puerto Ricans with defence of their ownisland. There would be similar objections, though not perhaps to the same extent,in other Bases Colonies. In view of the risk of disorder involved by the proposal,it was felt desirable to make the objections known to the United States in washington, and the Joint Staff Mission have now taken the matter up with theUnited States War Department.91. The Governor of Trinidad has reported a further serious mass clash between the local population and United States negro troops in that Colony. TheGovernor has been told that the question of making representations to the UnitedStates for the removal of these troops will be considered here if he recommends it.92. Arrangements are being concerted with the War Office, the two MilitaryCommands in the West Indies and the Governors of the Colonies in that area forthe recruitment of A T.S. for service in Washington and in the West Indies.As it is understood that the United States would object to the employment of coloured A.T.S. in Washington, recruitment for service there will be restricted to white women. Apart from this, there will be no discrimination in the arrange-ments and terms for the recruitment of white and coloured A.T.S. in the west indies.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.93. There have been no developments in Arab politics, though discussions regarding the formation of an Arab political body, to which reference was madein the last report, have continued intermittently.94. On the Jewish side interest is focussed mainly on the rescue of Jewsfrom Europe and on the Government&apos;s proposals for post-war development and reconstruction. Initial reception of the latter by both Arab and Jewish presswas not unfavourable, but subsequently Mr. Ben Gurion made a bitter attack onthe proposals in a speech to the elected assembly of the Jewish community. he urged the Jewish community to adopt an attitude of non-co-operation. A similarattitude has been adopted by Revisionists and Others. Objection to the proposalsappears to derive largely from the fact that they are not based on the promise of Palestine as a Jewish State.95. A particularly disturbing feature of Jewish activity is that there hasbeen a series of thefts of arms, ammunition and explosives from military establish-ments on an even more serious scale than previously, including two consignments of some 300 rifles each, 22 machine guns, 8,640 lbs. of high explosive and 8,000detonators. Evidence points to the existence of large-scale arms stealing racketorganised by the Jewish authorities with branches throughout the Middle East:There has also been collusion by Jewish units of regiments employed on guardduties, and by British military personnel who have been bribed to work on behalfof the organisers. The ring is directly connected&quot; with the Hagana (one of theJewish illegal &quot; armies &quot;) and the object behind these thefts is clearly theequipping of Jewish illegal military organisations.96. Tension among industrial workers ea,sed with the advance publicationof the sections of the Wages Committee report dealing with the cost of living.The Manufacturers&apos; Association and the General Federation of Jewish Labouragreed to discussion of revision of industrial award on the basis of the Com-
mittee&apos;s report under the Chairmanship, of the Controller of Man-Power and negotiations proceeded with difficulty, but agreement (with reservations) has beenreached.97.   There was no improvement in Jewish or Arab recruiting.Ceylon.98..   Additional Labour for Rubber Estates. The Government of India, on (Govt. of Indialearning that the Government of Ceylon had decided to defer returning any cToyio^tei. No.definite decision on their conditional offer to release labour for Ceylon pending an 2584 of 2.4.43).attempt to recruit a sufficient force locally, have informed the Governor of Ceylonthat the negotiations must be regarded as at an end and the offer as withdrawn.Fiji.99.   Sir Philip Mitchell, Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner for the ^Western Pacific, returned to his Headquarters at Suva, Fiji, on the 17th April,after seven weeks&apos; leave in New Zealand.Mauritius.100. Proposed Prolongation of life of Executive Council of Government. Owing to war conditions general elections to the Council of Government were not held in Mauritius in 1941, but the life of the Council was prolonged for threeyears. The Governor has now recommended that, in order to avoid political controversy detrimental to the war effort, and as the majority of the presentElected Members would probably be returned, the life of the Council should beextended for a further three years. The Governor has been informed that, whilethe Secretary of State agrees in principle to the extension, it is desired that theGovernor should consider whether a period of one year only would be preferable,with further extensions from year to year, if necessary.101. Nomination of an Indian Member to the Executive Council. TheGovernor has proposed the nomination to the unofficial side of the ExecutiveCouncil of an Indian Member, and this proposal will be recommended to HisMajesty for approval in due course. This is the first occasion on which an Indianhas been appointed to be a Member of the Executive Council of Mauritius.Bahamas.102. I am watching carefully to see the attitude which the Legislature takesup towards the recommendations in Sir Alison Russell&apos;s report on the recentdisturbance. So far as this report recommended the introduction of certain socialmeasures regarding trade unions, &amp;c, there is reason to believe that the Legisla-ture will enact the necessary Legislation. But there appears little likelihoodat present that they will introduce the measures of direct taxation which wererecommended.- Bermuda.103. The Governor had a semi-official enquiry from the local United states authorities about a proposal put forward by one&apos;of the United States service departments for the evacuation of United States nationals from Bermuda, Theobject of this,proposal was stated to be the saving of shipping space for importsof food. The matter was discussed with Lord Knollys, the Governor, on his visit to this country, and it was decided to discourage the United States from putting forward the proposal officially.Uganda.104.   The jubilee of the proclamation of the Uganda Protectorate was( celebrated on the 1st April.   Ceremonies were held in Kampala, and messageswere exchanged, with His Majesty The King, the Secretary of State and.Lord Lugard.Gold Coast.105. The activities of M. Beretta of the Fighting French movement werementioned in the Cabinet report of May 1942. Officiallv he was attached to theFighting French Mission in the Gold Coast but was not a member of it, his duties being those of looking after the interests of th*e Jamahene and his followers who had sought asylum in the Gold Coast.   In February and March of
1943 a number of Fighting French sympathisers entered Gold Coast territory &apos;at Half Assini from the Ivory Coast and on the 21st March a further party ofthree entered the territory at Berekum. The Resident Minister has reported that,although it is not established that any of these individuals were enticed over bythe Fighting French Mission, there is no doubt that M. Beretta assisted theirescape. In the instance of the Berekum party he had gone so far as to write toa priest warning him of the impending arrival of the fugitives and also to arrangefor a car to meet them. The Resident Minister, who feels strongly in the matter,has accordingly pressed for M. Beretta&apos;s removal. The Foreign Office, throughthe British Mission to the French National Committee, have suggested that M.Beretta might be found employment elsewhere in order to avoid further friction.No reply has yet been received. Commandant Blan, who is acting head of theFrench Mission in Accra, has said that he would seek instructions on the matterfrom the French National Committee in London, and meanwhile he has agreed toarrange that M. Beretta should not leave Accra.Refugees.106. A conference opened at Bermuda on the 19th April between representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the United States to con-sider the refugee problem. The United Kingdom delegation was led by Mr.. Law,Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The delegationswere the guests of the Bermuda Government. This is the first international conference to be held at Bermuda, and the Government of Bermuda hope thatit may be followed by others. Sir Bernard Reilly, of the Colonial Office, was attached to the United Kingdom delegation to represent Colonial interests
