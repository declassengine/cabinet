THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-    .   --------- )Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1943.SECRET. Copy No.   33/W.P. (43) 209.May 17, 1943.WAR CABINET.WOLFRAM.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.I invite the attention of my colleagues to the increasing importance of wolfram and of our attempts to deprive the enemy of it. Its uses are too wellknown to need detailed description : as a component of high-speed steels; as the raw material from which filaments are made and, above all, as the essentialconstituent of tungsten carbide for tipping &quot;machine tools and for cores for anti-tank armour-piercing projectiles, it is of vital and increasing importanceto the enemy&apos;s war effort just as it is to our own.2. Wolfram is widely produced in many parts of the world, but is foundonly to a negligible extent in Axis Europe. With the loss of Burma and the partial interruption of supplies from China, our own supply position was for atime somewhat precarious. It.has, however, improved beyond expectation, and during 1943 we can count on acquiring 6,650 tons in terms of 65 per cent,concentrates, against a consumption estimated at 6,320 tons. Our stock at theend of 1943 should be 9,680 tons. The American position is also satisfactory,,though somewhat less secure than our own.3. The enemy&apos;s supply position, on the other hand, is precarious in theextreme. His basic requirements are estimated at 6,000 tons this year, though he could certainly use much more to our disadvantage. His stocks at the beginningof the year probably did not exceed 500 tons. Production in Axis Europe isestimated at 250 tons. There is reason to believe that the Japanese will not beable to spare more than 1,000 tons, and there is of course no certainty that theywill succeed in running the blockade with any particular shipment. The enemymust, therefore, try to secure something like 5,000 tons from the iberian peninsula. ...4. Spain and Portugal, with productions of some 4,000-4,500 tons and5,000 tons respectively, are also our biggest suppliers. The Ministry of Supply .count on obtaining 3,400 tons from Portugal and (very conservatively) 1,000 tons from Spain in 1943, nearly two-thirds of our expected acquisitions in 1943. Sothere are important supply reasons as well as purely pre-emptive reasons forsecuring the greatest possible quantities of wolfram from these two countries.5. So far as Spain is concerned, our pre-emptive campaign, after a shakystart, is progressing very favourably; we may well get from Spain this year about,000 tons, possibly even 3,000. We may reasonably hope to limit Germanacquisitions to 1,500-2,000 tons. The extent of our purchases of wolfram (nowcosting something like  7,000 a ton in Spain) is, however, limited by two factors,namely, the amount of pesetas we can earn, and the willingness of the SpanishGovernment to allow us to buy and export freely. In practice, these two limitingfactors mean that we must maintain our export trade with Spain at the highest possible level consistent with blockade considerations in order to secure thenecessary currency for our purchases; and that we must supply Spain with sufficient raw materials and other goods, however difficult our own supply position,to ensure that the Spanish Government place no impediment in the way of ourpre-emptive campaign.-[25450]
26. The position in Portugal is very different, since the amount of wolframwe acquire does not depend on the success of our own pre-emptive efforts, buton the Portuguese Governments decision as to the proportions in which theirwolfram is to be divided between the two groups of belligerents. Dr. Salazarhas signed, an agreement with the Germans under which they are apparently toreceive up to 2,100 tons. This is approximately the same amount as was actuallyexported to Germany during the previous &quot; wolfram year &quot; i.e*, the year ended the 28th February, 1943-and our hopes of reducing German acquisitions duringthe current year by negotiation have thus been frustrated from the outset. the seriousness of the step taken by Dr. Salazar is enhanced by the fact that last yearalso he signed an agreement with the enemy behind, our backs, and that he hascompletely ignored the various requests made to him during 1942 and the early part of 1943 that he should not commit himself to the Germans until he had fully considered our own claims.7. I do not wish at this moment to ask my colleagues to consider theappropriate reaction to this latest unfriendly act on the part of our oldest ally.I desire only to emphasise that as Germany has already reduced to a minimum the use of wolfram for other purposes, her output of the most effective type ofarmour-piercing projectiles would be substantially decreased if she could be deprived altogether of Portuguese wolfram e.g...-by Portugal declaring war on germany.   I would like, however, to make two concrete&apos;suggestions : (a) As regards Portugal, that the Chiefs of Staff should be invited to take note of the strategic importance of wolfram and of Dr. Salazar&apos;transaction, in order that this factor may be taken into due account in their consideration of other strategic questions involving Portugal, and. inorder to enable us to concert action with the United StatesGovernment.(b) As regards Spain, that the attention of all departments concerned shouldbe drawn to the conditions under which successful pre-emption in thatcountry has to be conducted, and to the vital importance of maintainingsterling area exports at the highest possible level. It would perhaps be convenient for a directive to be given to the departments concerned that they should consider the whole question, establish any necessary machinery and take any necessary steps to achieve this object.S.Ministry of Economic Warfare,May 17, 1943.
