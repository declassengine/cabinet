THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1943.SECRET. Copy No.- //-    /WAR CABINET.CEYLON CONSTITUTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MY colleagues will remember that when I brought this matter before them at the end of March (W.P. (43) 129), the War Cabinet invited a Committee underthe Chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council to examine the draft statement which it was proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make on the question of Constitutional reform of Ceylon.2. My colleagues on this Cabinet Committee have now completed their examination of the draft Statement and an amended form of the draft is annexed to this Memorandum which embodies alterations designed to meet the criticismsraised by the Cabinet and suggestions put forward by the Committee. TheGovernor of Ceylon has also expressed his concurrence in the draft.3. Particular points which were the subject of special comment at our last meeting were : (a) The safeguarding of minority rights, and(b) The protection of the commercial interests of British subjects not resident in Ceylon.These matters are specifically referred to in paragraph 5 of the draft statement as now amended under which any Bills in relation to them are to be reservedfor the signification of His Majesty&apos;s Pleasure.4. As regards the likelihood of a Statement in this form being acceptable to Ceylon Ministers, the Governor has reported that it is impossible for him toadvise with any certainty what the reactions of individual Ministers are likelyto be, though he is satisfied that there is a large body of moderate opinion whichwould be against any demand for complete independence as opposed to consti-tutional reform, and that, in its view, apart from absorption by India, the only other possibility for Ceylon&apos;s future is internal home rule within the BritishCommonwealth of Nations with His Majesty&apos;s Government prepared, ascontroller of her external relations, to arbitrate if need arises between the conflicting claims of India and herself. The Governor considers that if no promise as to internal home rule within the. British Commonwealth of Nationsis given now, the trend of all Ceylonese opinion will be towards throwing in theirlot whole-heartedly with the Indian Nationalists, and of making the best termspossible with them. The Governor and the Commander-in-Chief have no hesitation in recommending that, as the proposed Statement goes further towardsinternal home rule within the British Commonwealth of Nations than anythinghitherto published, it should be made.5. The Board of Ministers in Ceylon have urged that a final reply to their request for reconsideration of the draft Statement approved by the War Cabinetin December last .(W.P. (42) 564) should be made before the 25th May when theState Council reassembles and the question of constitutional reform will immediately be raised. The Governor has reported to me that notice of a motiondemanding complete independence has already been tabled. The present Ministers[25444] vW.P. (43) 204.May 15, 1943.
who champion the British connexion will be the subject of an attack by theNationalist hot-heads unless the Leader of the State Council is in a position tomake a satisfactory statement on this subject.6. My colleagues on the Sub-Commitee have unanimously approved of the amended Statement being submitted to the Cabinet with a view to its receiving the formal approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and I trust that this will nowbe forthcoming.O. S.Colonial Office,May 15, 1943.ANNEXURE.Draft Statement.IN 1941 the following assurance was given to the Board of Ministers in ceylon : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under further consideration thequestion of constitutional reform in Ceylon. The urgency and importanceof the reform of the Constitution are fully recognised by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, but before making decisions upon the present proposals for reform, concerning which there has been so little unanimity, but which areof such importance to the well-being of Ceylon, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould desire that the position should be further examined and made thesubject of further consultation by means of a Commission or Conference.This cannot be arranged under war conditions, but the matter will be taken up with the least possible delay after the war.&quot;After further consideration, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided thatit is in the general interest to give greater precision to the foregoing statement with the object of removing any doubts regarding His Majesty&apos;s governments intentions. Accordingly, His Majesty&apos;s Government have asked the Governor to convey to the Board of Ministers the following message : 1. &quot; The post-war re-examination of the reform of the Ceylon Constitution,to which His Majesty&apos;s Government stands pledged, will be directed towards thegrant to Ceylon by Order of His Majesty in Council, of full responsible Govern-ment under the Crown in all matters of internal civil administration.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government will retain control of the provision, construc-tion, maintenance, security, staffing, manning and use of such defences, equipment,establishments and communications as His Majesty&apos;s Government may deem necessary for the Naval, Military and Air security of the Commonwealth,including that of the Island, the cost thereof being shared between the twoGovernments in agreed proportions.3. Ceylon&apos;s relations with foreign countries and with other parts of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations will be subject to the control and directionof His Maj;esty&apos;s Government.4. The Governor will be vested With such powers as will enable him, ifnecessary, to enact any direction of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to matters within the scope of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Declaration; and his assent to local measures upon these matters will be subject to reference to HisMajesty&apos;s Government.5. The present classes of reserved Bills in the Royal Instructions will be largely reduced under a new Constitution. Apart from measures affectingDefence and External Relations it is intended that these shall be restricted toclasses of Bills which (a) Relate to the Royal Prerogative, the rights and property of HisMajesty&apos;s subjects not residing in the Island, and the trade and shipping of any part of the Commonwealth :(b) Have evoked serious opposition by any racial or religious community andwhich in the Governors opinion are likely to involve oppression orunfairness to any community :(c) Relating to currency.
6. The limitations contained in the preceding) paragraph will not be deemedto prevent the Governor from assenting in the King&apos;s name to any measurerelating to, and conforming with, any trade agreements concluded with theapproval of His Majesty&apos;s Government by Ceylon with other parts of theCommonwealth. It is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Island&apos;commercial relations should be settled by the conclusion of agreements, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be pleased to assist in any negotiations with thisobject.7. The framing of a Constitution in accordance-with the terms of this declaration will require such examination of detail and such precision of definition ias cannot be brought to bear so long as the whole of the energies of theservice and other Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government must remainfocussed on the successful prosecution of the war. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill, however, once victory is achieved, proceed to examine by suitable commissioner Conference such detailed proposals as the Ministers may in the meantime&quot;&apos;have been able to formulate in the way of a complete constitutional scheme,subject to the clear understanding that acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof any proposals will depend.First, upon His Majesty&apos;s Government being satisfied that they are infull compliance with the preceding portions of this Statement; and secondly, upon their subsequent approval by three-quarters of all members of the State Council of Ceylon, excluding the officers of State andthe Speaker or other presiding officer.8. In their consideration of this problem His Majesty&apos;s Government have very fully appreciated and valued the contribution which Ceylon has made andis making to the war effort of the British Commonwealth and the United Nations,and the co-operation which, under the leadership of the Board of Ministers andthe State Council, has made this contribution effective.&apos;&apos;
