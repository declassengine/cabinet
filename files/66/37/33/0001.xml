THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.RECORD OF A CONVERSATION AT LUNCHEON AT THE BRITISHC EMBASSY, WASHINGTON, ON 22nd MAY, 1943.THE Prime Minister met the following at luncheon at the Embassy on the22nd May, 1943 :-The Vice-President (Mr. Wallace), the Secretary of War (Mr. Stimson),the Secretary of the Interior (Mr. Ickes), the Chairman of the Foreign relations committee of the Senate (Senator Connally) and the Under-Secretary of State(Mr. Sumner Welles).World and Regional Councils.In the course of a general talk about the structure of a post-war settlement,Mr. Churchill said that the first preoccupation must be to prevent furtheraggression in the future by Germany or Japan. To this end he contemplatedan association of the United States, Great Britain and Russia. If, as he under-,stood, the United States wished to include China in an association with theof her three, he was perfectly willing that this should be done; but howevergreat the importance of China, she was not comparable to the others. On these powers would rest the real responsibility for peace. They together with certain other Powers should form a Supreme World Council.Subordinate to this World Council there should be three Regional Councils,one for Europe, one for the American Hemisphere and one for the Pacific.Europe.Mr. Churchill thought that after the war Europe might consist of sometwelve States or Confederations who would form the Regional European Council.It was important to re-create a strong France, whatever we might think aboutFrench deserts or the probable difficulty of achieving our purpose. For theprospect of having no strong country on the map between England and russia was not attractive. Moreover, the Prime Minister could not easily foresee theUnited States being able to keep large numbers of men indefinitely on guard in.Europe. If such an experiment were tried he could not believe it would last for more than one Presidential election. Great Britain could not do so either.No doubt it would be necessary, and he thought it would be possible, that theUnited States should be associated in some way in the policing of Europe, inwhich Great Britain would obviously also have to take part; but France alsomust assist.Then there would be.Spain and Italy. He also hoped that in South-eastern europe there might be several confederations; a Danubian federation based onVienna and doing something to fill the gap caused by the disappearance of the austro-Hungarian Empire. Bavaria might join this group. Then there shouldbe a Balkan federation. .He would, like to see Prussia divided from the rest of Germany, forty millionPrussians being a manageable European unit. Many people wished to carry the process of division further and divide Prussia itself into component parts,but on this question the Prime Minister reserved judgment. Poland and Czecho-slovakia, he hoped, would stand together in friendly relations with Russia. Thisleft the Scandinavian countries and Turkey, which last might or might not. be-willing, with Greece, to play some part in the Balkan system.Mr. Wallace asked about Belgium and Holland, suggesting that they mightjoin France. Mr. Churchill said that was a possibility, or, alternatively, theymight form a group of the Low Countries with Denmark. Mr. Wallace askedwhether the Prime Minister contemplated the possibility of Switzerland joiningwith France, but the Prime Minister was disposed to regard Switzerland as aspecial case.In his view each of the dozen or so of the European countries should appoint a representative to the European Regional Council, thus creating a form ofUnited States of Europe. He thought Count Coudenhov-Kalergi&apos;s ideas on thissubject had much to recommend them.[25547]^
The A merican Hemisphere.Similarly, there might be a Regional Council for the Americas of which thePrime Minister thought Canada would naturally be a member and would repre-sent the British Commonwealth.The Pacific.There should, be a Regional Council for the Pacific in which he supposedthat Russia would participate. He thought it was quite possible that when the pressure on her western frontiers had been relieved Russia would turn herattention to the Far East.Relation of the Regional Councils to the Supreme World Council.The Regional Councils should be subordinate, in.the Prime Minister&apos;s view,to the World Council. The members of the World Council should sit on the regional Councils in which they were directly interested and he hoped that inaddition to being represented on the American Regional Council and the PacificRegional Council, the United States would also be represented on the EuropeanRegional Council. However this might be, the last word Would remain with theSupreme World Council, since any issues that the Regional Councils were unableto settle would automatically be of interest to the World Council and bring theWorld Council in.Mr. Wallace thought that the other countries would not agree that the world council should consist of the four major Powers alone. Mr. Churchill agreed, and expressed the view that to the four Powers should be added others by election in rotation from the Regional Councils. The central idea of the structure wasthat of&apos; a three-legged stool the - World Council resting on three RegionalCouncils. But he attached great importance to the regional principle. It wasonly the countries whose interests were directly affected by a dispute who couldbe expected to apply themselves with sufficient vigour to secure a settlement. Ifcountries remote from a dispute were among those called upon in the first instance to achieve a settlement the result was likely to be merely vapid and academicdiscussion.Mr. Wallace asked what in practice would be the procedure if, for example,there were a dispute between Peru and Ecuador. Mr. Churchill said that such a dispute would fall to be dealt with in the first place by the American RegionalCouncil, but always under the general overriding authority of the World Council.In the instance chosen the interests of countries outside the American Hemispherewould hardly be affected; but plainly a dispute which threatened the peace of theworld might very well not be susceptible to being treated only on a regional basis and the Supreme World Council would quickly be brought in.Neutrality.Mr. Churchill was asked whether the association of nations which he contemplated would be confined to the United Nations, or include the neutrals.He said that in his view there was advantage in trying to induce those nations at present neutral to join the United Nations before the end of the war. Hethought we ought to use all possible persuasion and pressure to secure thiswhen it could be done with safety to the nation concerned. An example wasTurkey. His policy was to help Turkey to build up her own forces to the point where, at the right moment, she could and would effectively intervene. Whenthe United Nations brought the guilty nations to-the bar of justice, he could seelittle but an. ineffective and inglorious role for Mr. de Valera and others who might remain neutral to the end.The Lessons of the League of Nations.Mr. Churchill maintained that we had much to learn from the experience ofthe League of Nations. It was wrong to say that the League had failed. Itwas rather the member States who had failed the League. Senator Connallyagreed, and pointed to the achievements of the League in the years immediatelyafter 1919. Mr. Stimson also agreed, and thought that if the original guarantee to France had not fallen through, subsequent French policy, and also the historyof the League, would have been very different.National and International Forces.Mr. Churchill said that force would clearly be required to see that peace waspreserved. He suggested that there should be&apos; an agreement between the united nations as to the minimum and maximum armed forces which each would
Maintain. The forces of each country might be divided into two contingents, theone to form the national forces of that country and the other to form itscontingent to an international police force at the disposal of the RegionalCouncils under the direction of the Supreme World Council. Thus, if one countryout of twelve in Europe threatened the peace, eleven contingents would be readyto deal with that country if necessary. The personnel of the internationalcontingent provided by each country would be bound, if it were so decided bythe World Council, to undertake operations against any country other than theirown. Mr. Wallace said that bases would be required for these contingents.Mr. Churchill agreed, In this connexion he said that he would place a total prohibition for an indefinite time upon the practice in the enemy countries, and certainly in Germany, of the art of flying. There should be international airlines, for example, operating in and through Prussia which would give thePrussians as good&apos;a service at as cheap rates as obtained elsewhere, but they shouldneither be allowed to fly themselves nor to build aircraft.Fraternal Association between Great Britain and the United States.Mr. Churchill said that there was something else in his &apos; mind which wascomplementary to the ideas he had just expressed. The proposals for a world security organisation did not exclude special friendships devoid of sinisterpurpose against others. He could see small hope for the world unless the UnitedStates and the British Commonwealth worked together in what he would callfraternal association. He believed that this could take a form which would confer on each advantages without sacrifice. He would like the citizens of each, withoutlosing their present nationality, to be able&apos; to come and settle and trade withfreedom and equal rights in the territories of the other. There might be a commonpassport or a special form of passport or visa. There might even be some commonform of citizenship, under which citizens, of the United States and of the. BritishCommonwealth might enjoy voting privileges after residential qualification andbe eligible for public office in the territories of the other, subject, of course, to the laws and institutions there prevailing.Then there were bases. He had himself welcomed the Destroyer-Bases deal,not for the sake of the destroyers, useful as these were, but because he felt itwas to the advantage of both countries that the United States should have theuse of such bases in British territory as she might find necessary to her own defence, for a strong United States was a vital interest of the British Common-wealth and vice versa. He looked forward, therefore, to an extension of thepractice of common user of bases for the common defence of common interests.Take the Pacific, where there were countless islands possessed by enemy Powers.There were also British islands and harbours. If he had anything to do withthe direction of public affairs after the war, he would certainly advocate thatthe United States had the use of those that they might require for bases.American opinion.   Importance of concluding an agreement during the war.All the American guests present said that they had been thinking on moreor less the lines propounded by the Prime Minister, and thought that it was not impossible that American opinion would accept them or something like them.The Ambassador asked Mr. Welles whether he thought that the establishment. ofa Regional Council for Europe would have the effect of leading United Statesopinion to disinterest itself in European affairs. Mr. Welles was not afraid ofthis, having regard to the overriding responsibility of the Supreme world council and the relation between it and the Regional Councils. Mr. IStimsonsaid most emphatically that, in his opinion, there would be a tendency to relaxafter hostilities ceased, and a reluctance to embark upon new internationalexperience. He believed that it would be much easier to secure American agree-ment during the war; indeed, that it was a case of during the war- or never.The others were disposed to agree, and all felt that the best approach to futureco-operation was to present such plans for the future as a continuation of theco-operation now in force, and to do so while the war was still proceeding..Mr. Surnner Welles reiterated this to the Ambassador as he was walking out,and put to him certain suggestions which are recorded in&apos; Annex A to thismemorandum.The Prime Minister made two other suggestions, both of which carried thewarm assent of those present. First, that after the war we should continue thepractice of Combined Staff conversations, and second, that we should by.constant
contact, take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that the main lines of our foreign policy ran closely together.Mr. Wallace said to the Ambassador as he left that it was the most encouraging conversation in which he had taken part for the last two years.Mr. Churchill on all occasions stated that he was expressing only personal views.Following subsequent conversations with the President and Vice-President,the Prime Minister made a note which forms Annex B to this memorandum.ANNEX A.1. As he was leaving after luncheon to-day, Mr. Sumner Welles said to methat in his view Mr. Stimson had been entirely right in underlining the import-ance from the point of view of American opinion in trying to secure the adoptionof at least the essentials of the post-war security order before the end of the war.After the war relaxation would set in, and a tendency towards isolationism.He therefore suggested the conclusion during the war of two protocols :(1) a protocol between the four major Powers agreeing to assume joint responsibility for keeping the peace after the war, and containing anundertaking to maintain minimum and maximum forces for thepurpose;(2) a protocol between the United Nations, by which they would agree toco-operate for the preservation of peace. .2. .In reply to a question from me, Mr. Welles said that the protocols wouldrequire the agreement of the Senate, but that this would be more readily obtain-able during the war than later.3. Mr. Welles was unwilling to put his suggestion on paper, as he had notbeen able to submit it as yet to the Secretary of State or the President. But i hope-you may be able and willing to sound the President out on it. It might bea real sta^e in our business.ANNEX B.Note by the Prime Minister.The Vice-Presiclent in conversation with the President. and me next dayseemed a little anxious lest other countries should think that Britain and theUnited States were trying to boss the world. I made it perfectly clear * they ought not to be put off necessary and rightful action by such suggestions. I thinkhis thought would also be that foreigners should adopt the citizenship of thecountry in which they settle. It is the essence of my idea that citizenship wouldbe retained in the Anglo-American sphere even if this were wholly exceptional.The President liked the ventilation of these ideas, especially the military aspect.We both thought it essential that the Anglo-American Combined Staff institutionshould be continued for a good long time after the war, at any rate until we canall be sure the world is safe.

He reverted to thequestions discussed at the Prime Minister*s luncheon ofwhich I sent you record with my letter of 28th May concerningthe possibility of getting the four major powers and all theUnited Nations to hind themselves by suitable protocols totake   action for post-war security system.     He againemphasised  *his view of the urgency, partly for reasonspreviously stated,  of greater promise of getting this sort of thing through while the war was on and also for the reason of taking advantage of the present good atmosphere with the soviets.     He developed, his ideas of supreme world counciland regional councils in greater detail than he had done tothe Prime Minister and hoped to be able to get the President&apos;approval of his plans so that he could let us have it all on paper.     Shortly, his idea for the composition of the supremeworld council is -(a) four major powers;(b) two members elected by European and Americanregional councils respectively fx*om panel of accepted names;(c) one elected by the Pacific regional council;(d) one elected by Kiddle East and North Africanindependent countries;(e) one elected by the British Commonwealth ofNations.Eleven in all.2, He would make it a condition of action by supremeworld council that there should be unanimity between the fourgreat powers.     This in his view would only be recognisingrealities but would, also be valuable from the point of viewof United States opinion.

3. Ho expressed strongly the view that we need not be greatly afraid of United States public opinion seeking to pullout of responsibility for talcing action at some later date ona commitment bo assumed, if we got so far.     American opinion would (grp. unclec.) be unwilling to go back on engagements   -once made and also the feeling of responsibility for makinga show that was largely American work, would pull morepowerfully in the right direction.4. Ho was full of praise for the way in which Lawhad handled the food conference and I have seldom seen himmore expansive or clearly appreciative,5. He repeated what the President has said before thatthey looked forward to further conferences at not too distanta date dealing with metflla;      certain key materials likerubber and jfcin and civil aviation.     But particularly withregard to this lasf-&quot;lie &apos;sai&amp;^ijhrey would certainly attempt toreach agreement with us.6. Ho said that he was more and more impressed withthe way in which public feeling in the country as regardspost-war co-operation was ahead of Congress.7. The one matter on which he foresaw difficulty and which he thought we ought to straighten out soon was how we should treat the French Committee of Liberation if and when wo went into Prance.     He was very clear that wemust not invest it with even provisional authority in theway of treating it in any sense like a provisionalgovernment.     To do this would in effect saddle theUnited States and ourselves with the responsibility for manythings that we should have deprived ourselves of power tocontrol.3, This led him to a good many reproaches on thebasis of linos that are very familiar to you from the lipsof Mr, Hull.     To all this Lav/ and I made the familiar repliesbut it was interesting to get it from Welles as showing howdeep all that has cut.9, Law will be able to expand.(Copies sent to Prime Minister)Pjlstributi.on: :..The KingWar CabinetChancellor of the ExchequerLord privy SealS/S for IndiaService MinistersMinister of Aircraft Production
