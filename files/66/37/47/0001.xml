E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,17th June, 1943.Introductory.1. (a) Apart from the problematical role which Russia may seek to play inthe future, the principal threats to the peace and stability of the Middle East andthe maintenance therein of the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government arise from (i) The presence in the Middle East of two discordant elements, the jews in Palestine and the French in Syria and the Lebanon.(ii) The danger of economic disorder and collapse.The dangers arising from either of these factors, or from both in conjunction,may lead in the immediate post-war period, or even sooner, to such disorganisation-tion and hostility on the part of the Middle East peoples as would jeopardiseour own position and further give an opening for other interested Powers(e.g., Russia) to fish in the troubled waters.(b) In considering methods designed&apos; to counter these dangers the middle eastern War Council have viewed the problem primarily from the standpoint ofour imperial interests, as they exist now and will continue to exist after the war,and their several resolutions, to whatever country or problem specifically related,are intended to be read as closely inter-connected. They believe that the cause ofimperial security cannot fail to be greatly assisted by a wise and imaginativetreatment of the economic and administrative problems arising, and that such treatment is equally demanded by the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government andof the countries affected.(c) In particular, they believe that a strong contributory factor to the stability of the Middle East may eventually be found in the establishment of a regional Council, related to any wider international organisation that may be created. The membership of such a Council would include, in addition to repre-sentatives of the Governments of Middle East territories, representatives of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, of the United States, and of such other countries as maybe deemed appropriate. -Signed on behalf of theMiddle Eastern War Council:Cairo, 12th May, 1943. &apos; &apos; R. G. CASEY.
Resolutions.The following series of Resolutions have been adopted unanimously by theMiddle Eastern War Council : I.-Palestine.1. As a result of Jewish extremism and Arab reactions to it the menaceof armed conflict in Palestine is becoming increasingly grave. The most likelytiming for an outbreak will be as the war in Europe draws to a close. On theother hand, it may be precipitated by any chance incident, or if our armed forcesin Palestine are inadequate.It is possible that if the right action is taken now, the outbreak may be averted. -The principal reasons for these conclusions are contained in the attached memorandum.2. In the interests of our present and future position in the Middle East,it is essential that a conflict in Palestine should be averted. Fighting in Palestine,which we should have, of course, to suppress, would be likely to cause simultaneousoutbreaks in Iraq and Syria, would have immediate repercussions in Egypt andSaudi Arabia, and would affect for many years to come our relations with countries containing Moslem populations, including India.3. There is no hope of agreement between the Jews and the Arabs beforethe war in Europe ends. It is impossible at present to impose any fresh compromise-mise solution which would not either be regarded as a breach o&apos;f faith by theArabs, or be so completely unacceptable to the Jewish leaders as to be impracticable.4.   In the interests of security, the following steps should be taken : (a) To make a resort to force unprofitable to either party, the British forces available for Palestine should not be allowed to fall below the equivalent of one infantry division in Palestine and one division,including a proportion of armour, on short call.(&amp;) Before the 1st April, 1944 (lvhen the Jewish immigration quota ends),the above forces should be increased by one division, including a proportion of armour.(c) The British police force in Palestine should be brought up to full strength,and a British gendarmerie should be created on lines alreadysubmitted.(d) Efforts should be intensified to discover and seize hidden arms (whetherJewish or Arab) and to combat the traffic in arms.(e) A clear public warning should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthey have no intention of submitting to any attempt to alter theadministration of Palestine by force of arms, and that action willbe taken to deal with those responsible for incitement to violence.5. At the same time these measures are unlikely in themselves to be fully effective unless accompanied by a clear statement of policy. Deviation from theprinciples laid down in the White Paper would&apos;almost inevitably provoke an outbreak, and we recommend the reaffirmation by His Majesty&apos;s Government ofthe basic principles of their declared policy for Palestine, supported if possiblehy the Government of the United States of America.Supporting Memorandum.Palestine.1. The immediate menace to internal security arises from the fact that theJews are arming and preparing to fight, if necessary, to gain their political ends,of which the foremost and most dangerous is the demand for mass immigration and a Jewish State. The Arabs are at present quiet, but would take up armsagain if their essential interests were at stake. Both in Palestine and in the neighbouring States they are equally alarmed by the danger of being swamped byJewish immigrants. Jews and Arabs alike regard their respective interests, both political and economic, as irreconcilable and are prepared, in the last resort, to use force to maintain what they believe to be their rights.
Z012. On the Jewish side, hardly a week passes without an inflammatory speech in secret session of one or other of the official Zionist organisations, to the effectthat unless they can achieve their purpose otherwise, resort to force againstanyone who stands in their way (not excluding His Majesty&apos;s Government) isessential, and that this is the policy of the Zionist organisation and has beenprepared for.3. There are about 33,000* Jews trained in the use of arms in the british forces and in the various police formations in Palestine. There are also secretJewish forces (the Hagana, the Irgun Tzvai Leumi and the Palmach) containingover 80,000 trained men. These latter include many Jews serving either in theBritish forces or in police formations in Palestine.4. Both Jews and Arabs hold large quantities of illicit arms. TheCommander-in-Chief, Middle East Forces, on information supplied by theGeneral Officer Commanding, Palestine and the Palestine Chief of Police, is satisfied that the Jews have tens of thousands of rifles and pistols, hundreds of machine guns, a number of mortars and a large quantity of ammunition, explo-sives, grenades, mines and bombs. These are hidden in substantial cachesdispersed throughout the country. Action to increase these illicit stockscontinues, mainly by organised thefts from the British services. In March thetotal stolen by organised theft was 600 rifles; 23 machine guns; 3 tons of highexplosives and a large quantity of ammunition.5. Although the Arabs are unorganised politically and militarily, they are known to have illicit supplies of small arms. It is believed that they have sometens of thousands of rifles and pistols of all types, mainly held individually.6. The Arabs are easily excited, have the habit of banditry, and would readily come together in bands of increasing size throughout the country ifprovoked.7. Both parties have the means to enter into armed conflict. It is unlikelythat the Arabs will revolt without provocation, but there is a definite risk thatthey will be deliberately provoked. The principal danger lies in an endeavour onthe part of the Jews,, who are rapidly producing a highly organised militarymachine on Nazi lines, to seize the moment which is most favourable to themselves for the prosecution by force of their policy of establishing an exclusively jewish state in Palestine.II. Syria.The continued presence of France in the Levant is incompatible with our political and military interests in the Middle East as well as with the peacefuldevelopment and well being of the Arab&apos;countries.From the long-term strategic angle the presence of an unco-operative andunreliable foreign Power in the Levant States represents a permanent danger.The possibility of a revolt against a weak France at the end of the war, when for strategic or other reasons (e.g., disorders in Palestine) the British troops in the levant States had been greatly reduced, cannot be ruled out.2. Any form of closer political association between the Arab States or evenbetween the States of &quot;Greater Syria &quot; (i.e., Syria, Lebanon, Palestine andTransjordan) a development to which His Majesty&apos;s Government have declaredthemselves sympathetic, is hardly possible as long as the French maintain any direct influence, political or military, in Syria and the Lebanon.We recognise that our existing undertakings to the French, details of whichare given in the attached memorandum, render it an extremely difficult task tosecure the withdrawal of the French from the Levant States. Short of an offer of territorial compensation elsewhere, which we regard as impossible duringthe war, the only steps we can take now; are : (a) to continue to strengthen the independence of the States by all the means in our power so that they themselves, at the end of the war, mayachieve genuine national status in the spirit of the Atlantic Charter.. For this reason we should make every effort to discourage the signature of treaties between the Governments of the States and the fighting french or any other French administration that may be set up;* PIub approximately 8,000 outside Palestine.[25549] [I b 2,&apos;&quot;
(b) to reinforce our own prestige in the Levant:by insisting on the existing rights of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, in regard to all issuesappertaining to the conduct of the war;(c) to avoid any suggestion that we do not intend to carry out pledges given tothe States themselves such as, for example, our undertaking that theyshould be included in the sterling bloc.3. We consider that the policy outlined above is fully justified by the factthat the French have made and are making no sincere attempt to carry out theprovisions of the mandate or the spirit of their undertakings to the two Statesand, far from co-operating with us in the Levant, have pursued a self-interestedpolicy which has often resulted in impeding the war effort.Supporting Memorandum.Syria.1. It is difficult to envisage the possibility of any form of closer politicalassociation between the Arab States of the Middle East, or even of &apos;&apos; GreaterSyria &apos;&apos; in the future so long as the French, by right of treaty or otherwise,maintain influence and their military position in the Levant States. The Frenchare not only extremely unpopular in these States, but owing to their bad recordand their manifest reluctance to implement their promises to the States, their presence is also deeply resented by the other Arab countries.2. From the military point of view, the unco-operative and often obstructiveattitude of the French towards ourselves, at a time when their every interest andduty should have been to help us to a victory spelling the liberation of France,augurs ill for the co-operation we could look to from them under peace conditions.There is no doubt that the Middle East must remain a major British militaryinterest in the future, and it would be most unwise to encourage the continuedpresence in this, territory of a nation whose co-operation with us has been, andmust remain, anything but assured.3. The basis of our relations with the French in the Levant to-day is thePrime Ministers statements in the House of Commons on the 15th July and the8th September, 1941, and the Lyttelton-de Gaulle Agreements of the 25th July,1941. The essence of these was that we recognised the historic interests ofFrance in the Levant, and we stated that we had no interest in Syria or the lebanon excepting to win the war. We stated further that we had no desire toencroach in any way on the position of France, and that when the pledge byFree France and Great Britain in regard to the independence of Syria and the lebanon had been fulfilled we freely admitted that France should have the predominant and privileged position in the Levant among all European nations,although not that previously enjoyed by Vichy France.4. In view of these definite pledges, the only direct means of inducing theFrench to relinquish the position thus conceded to them would appear, to be tooffer them territorial compensation elsewhere. It has been suggested that theymight be willing to agree to withdraw from the Levant in return for the transfer to French control in some form or other of, for example, Tripolitania. This is,however, doubtful, and anyhow there would be insuperable objections to this orany other offer, at any rate during the war period, of a transfer of territory.5. The only course open to us now would therefore seem to be to do our utmost to strengthen the independence of the States, a policy to which we and,indeed, the French are pledged, and to prevent the French from obstructing any steps the States may wish to take towards closer political, financial or economic association with the other Arab countries.6. For example, we should seek to discourage any. further attempts on thepart of the French to induce the Syrian or Lebanese Governments to sign treaties:during the war on the model of the abortive 1936 Treaties. From the legal point &apos;of view, no treaty which the Syrian or Lebanese Governments could sign withthe Fighting French or any French administration outside France and not recognised -nised by the United Nations as the de jure Government of France could affect the;future of the mandate. Moreover, no such treaty could be held to be binding on a future French Government, which would be entitled to repudiate the whole or part of it. Once elections have been held we should therefore inform the french authorities in Syria that if such a step were contemplated we should feel iii
duty bound to tell the Governments of the two States that, for the above reasons,it would, in our view, be most unwise for them to attempt to negotiate treaties-untii the end of the war.7. Irrespective of the post-war situation, and merely on the basis of immediate war-time necessity, it seems necessary, on military grounds, that weshould lay far more stress than we have hitherto done on our military rights under existing agreements, which cover both offensive and defensive operations,including Article 1 of the Supplementary Lyttelton-de Gaulle Agreement, whichrecognises that the British Commander-in-Chief is empowered to take all measures of defence against the common enemy, as to the necessity of which he must obviously be the sole judge. In contrast with the attitude adopted hitherto,the right of the Commander-in-Chief under this Article should be fully recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government in practice as well as in theory, with theconcomitant implication that his actions or decisions will be fully supported bythem in the event of a reference by the French in Syria to General de Gaulle-&quot;under paragraph 2 of the same Article. Such support, at all times essential,would be particularly so if for any reason it should at some future date become necessary though this would undoubtedly be politically most undesirable -toreduce the number of British troops in the Levant and thus revive the Frenchagitation for transfer of the command.8. It is of paramount importance that His Majesty&apos;s Government should themselves scrupulously, observe all their pledges to the Levant States, as, forexample, the assurance that those States would be included in the sterling bloc,which was given in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s declaration of the 9th June, 1941,endorsing General Catroux&apos;s declaration made prior to the advance into Syria.The flight from the franc into goods which would undoubtedly follow a breach ofthis undertaking would have the most calamitous effect on security and on theeconomic and political situation not only in the Levant but in neighbouring countries. The withdrawal of the Levant States from the sterling bloc would alsorender most difficult or impossible any proposal for the establishment of a currency or customs union between the Levant States, Palestine and Trans Jordan,which would have obvious advantages, both immediate and long-term, and would ibe a natural corollary of any form of closer economic union between these States.III. Arab Confederation.1. The political confederation of Arab countries on a wide scale is impracticable at the present moment owing to the conflicting aspirations of thevarious countries and to the present peculiar status of Palestine and Syria..,2. While the initiative must be left to the Arabs, the most practical course is to encourage efforts towards economic and cultural unity, out of which some form of political confederation, at least in &quot;Greater Syria,&quot; may ultimatelyemerge.IV. Future Economic Policy.1. The economic stability and consequent social and political content-ment of the Middle East is a major strategic interest of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and&apos;thus of the United Nations. To achieve&apos;this purpose fully it isnecessary to consider the Middle East as a regional unit. The foundations of sucha conception have been laid on a war-time basis by the work of the Middle EastSupply Centre as an Anglo-American regional planning agency.2. As a result of world supply, transportation and monetary difficulties, andthe necessity for provisioning liberated countries and other deficient areas, Anglo-American controls over supplies and distribution will have to remain in being inthe Middle East until some considerable time after the end of the war. If theyare to operate effectively, it will be politically necessary from now onwards tomake them more acceptable to the Middle East Governments by a progressiveprocess of consultation and partnership accompanied, where possible, by a gradualrelaxation of restrictions.3. On a longer-term basis, it will be in the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-;ment, and of the United Nations generally, to call into being some form of regional economic organisation for the Middle East for implementing policies in;harmony with the Atlantic Charter, and in order to provide a means of advising
and guiding the Middle East Administrations in handling their common war1and post-war economic and monetary problems which they are incapable ofsolving alone. In the absence of an organisation of this nature, there is grave risk of economic collapse in the area as a whole, with its consequent effect on security. ;4. Our ultimate objective should be to create a Middle East economic council, as a consultative body representative of the Middle East governments and of the Governments of external Powers (principally Great Britain and theUnited States) with major interests in this region. This body would play thepart of an &quot; economic parliament,&quot; linked with and served by an executive and planning agency which could be developed out of the existing Middle East SupplyCentre, adapted and liberalised to meet the changing circumstances. The successof any such arrangements would depend to a marked extent on the quality and quantity of British and American personnel which can be made available in theMiddle East.5. This objective should be approached by stages, and the timing of thesuccessive stages, including the launching of the Council itself (which, to be effective, should be in being before the end of the war) will require careful handling in the light of events. The two main ways of approaching the objective,and at the same time of serving the short-term purpose described in paragraph 2,will be -(a) to take immediate steps to bring the local Governments, both collectivelyand individually, into consultation by means of conferences on subjects of interest to them, such as transport, food production, rationing,statistics, &amp;c.(b) to build up gradually a regional economic secretariat which would at the outset be linked to the Middle East Supply Centre, would providestatistics, documentation and the like of commpn interest to the Middle&apos; -&apos; East, and some at least of the personnel of which would be drawn fromthe territories concerned. This secretariat might eventually become the office of the agency described in paragraph 4.6. The Middle East Governments are unlikely to respond unless they see thatthey are likely to obtain more practical advantages from planned and co-ordinatedaction and from a progressive reversion to economic nationalism. The mainmeans of convincing them of this are (a) by relaxing (as we shall soon be in a position to do) some of the purelyrestrictive functions of the Middle East Supply Centre, and organi-sing, through the Centre, the procurement of supplies for war-timeconsumption;(b) by providing and interchanging expert advice, experience and informa-tion, directed increasingly towards reconstruction problems;(c) by facilitating after the war the co-ordinated procurement of supplies,particularly for development projects.7. The realisation of these objectives calls for an early initiative on the partof His Majesty&apos;s Government, preferably in association with the United StatesGovernment, if the present opportunity is not to be lost. This opportunity isprovided by the widespread but, as yet, incoherent desire for closer association between most of the Middle East States, which itf is generally agreed can best be approached on economic lines. It is desirable, in any event, for this movementto be guided into healthy and fruitful channels, in order to prevent it degenera-ting, as it may otherwise easily do, into a form of acute nationalism hostile to our influence. Provided the political problems of Palestine and Syria are resolved insuch a way as to make co-operation between the Middle East countries and HisMajesty&apos;s Government possible, these proposals offer one of the most hopefulmeans of keeping the general initiative in the Middle East in our hands.V. Inflation and Currency Problems.1. The Middle Eastern War Council has had under review the continualrise of prices, expansion of note issues, profiteering and other symptoms of inflation brought about by shortage of goods and heavy military expenditure, andviews with concern the dangerous possibilities latent-in the present situation,particularly in Persia and Syria. Unless drastic remedial action can be success-fully applied in these countries, there is serious risk of economic collapse leading:to strike, riots and even a breakdown of the machinery of government.
2. The. Council have not reviewed in detail the numerous proposals forcombating inflation which have been under consideration for some time past and are the subject of current discussion with London. They desire, however, togive their support to the particular proposals referred to below.3. The Council strongly support the recommendations recently made by theMinister of State that the methods of financing Allied military expenditure inthe Middle East should be reviewed in London and Washington, and that some means should be found for mobilising stocks of gold in the United States for war purposes. In particular, the Council urge that sufficient gold should be madeavailable for sale in local markets in the Middle East to bring down the priceof the sovereign from its present level of between  5 and  6 to the reserve pricefixed by the Treasury for sales in Persia from time to time.4. The procedure of selling gold at market prices would not only go some,way to offset the excessive and growing burden thrown on British taxpayers owingto the high prices and wages which have to be paid by the armed forces, but would also provide a popular and traditional medium for attracting savings fromthe peoples of the Middle East; and thus reinforce other measures, includingtaxation and price control, which local governments are being constantly urged to put into force in order to check inflation. &apos;5. In view of the critical currency situation in Syria and the Lebanon theCouncil have considered the possibility of establishing a currency union betweenPalestine, Transjbrdan and the Levant States, which would have obvious economic advantages, both immediate and long-term, and would be a natural corollary ofany form of closer economic union between these States. The Council recommendthat a special committee should be appointed in the Middle East to investigate the technical implications of the proposal. It is urged that a senior official of theTreasury or of the Bank of England should be associated with this enquiry.VI. Cultural Activities.1. There is a widespread and deep-seated desire in the Middle East forfurther opportunities for education. The comparative failure of Great britain to meet this need, and the active propaganda of the Axis countries, combinedin the pre-war years to dispose the younger Arab educated classes towardssympathy with Fascist ideas. In the future, assistance by British agencies inthe cultural field would be both welcomed locally and beneficial to all concerned,by fostering goodwill and encouraging the development of Arab thought on lines. in harmony with Western civilisation.2.   It is consequently essential that close study should be given by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and by British authorities in the Middle East, particularly the British Council, to the best means of bringing British influence to bear upon- this development.   This study should be co-ordinated in the Middle East by theMinister of State so long as his office exists:, 3.   Particular attention should be given to the practical possibilities andfinancial implications of (a) The strengthening of the British Council, both now and after the war.(&amp;) The encouragement of secondary and higher education, especially inbackward areas, including such measures as the development of english and Anglo-Arab Schools.(c) The stimulation of agricultural and technical education in the middle east, and, in particular, the creation- under British auspices of an agricultural College.(d) The appointment in sufficient numbers to suitable posts in the middle east of qualified British personnel, including first-class scholars.(Several vacancies already exist and should be filled immediately.)(e) The establishment in the Middle East of an Academy of Higher Studieswhere British (and other Europeans) and Arabs could work togetherupon Arab problems (social, economic, political, intellectual and; religious).(f) The development of Arab studies in England.
