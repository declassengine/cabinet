May9&quot; I945o COPY NO.V/;-. : CABINET,01 II.   ^^^IJ^^IOi OP OCCUPIED&apos;&apos;   TERRITORY.-Memorandum by, the Secretary,.of State for Foreign Affairs..The UoSc. War Department have submitted to the joint staff Mission in Washington the draft of a general directiveregarding the civil administration of HUSKYLAND when in Allied Military occupationsThis draft directive reveals a serious divergence of policy on one particular point,,  We had originally proposedthat it should be laid down that the leading Fascist officials should be replaced by subordinate Italian officials to be chosen because their sympathies were not fascist and becausethey wore capable administra&amp;or so The U.S. war department disagree with this policy, and their reasons are summarised as follows by the Joint Staff Mission:-&quot;The War Department object strongly..   Minor officialscan be left in their positions (President1s original draft called for exclusion of all members of the FascistPar-&apos;:y from office, but this was reversed)    but holders ofimportant offices such as Prefects and Mayors of importanttowns will inevitably be Fascists and will have to beremoved:-.    Americans clearly think that to replace themwith other Italians would involve us both in politicalcomplications similar to those which arose in north africa., and that the proper concept is to set up a purely military:, Government.     They, therefore, thinkthat the powers previously exercised by the holders ofthese major positions will have to be handed over to allied officers who would issue orders in their ownname So    They could use any Italian officials they wishedto guide or assist them, but such Italians should nothave any official position and no orders should go outin their names.-.&quot;The point at issue,therefore^, is whether we should accept the American concept that a purely military governmentshould be set up0      I am in favour of doing so, whilereserving for the Generals on the spot wide latitude as to how to interpret it when the time comes in the light of localconditions-?Since the Americans agree that &quot;minor officials can beleft in the;&apos; :. positions&quot;, the occasion on which the actualdivergence of policy&apos;will arise is when it comes to replacing the Prefects.) Mayors, and high officials, who by generalagreement must be removed.    Are they to be replaced by allied military officers (the American proposal^, or by subordinateItalian officials (our original proposal)?   The chief objectionto the American proposal    is that it would prove in practice

unworkable j, because there are    not enough qualifiedAllied administrators, and that we should have toaccept a flood of untrained and unsuitable Americansof Italian origin to take over the civil government?which might lead., if not to the breakdown of themachinery of government, at any rate to seriouslyimpairing its efficiency0I have therefore attempted in the attached draft telegram to His Majesty1s Ambassador, Washington,to reach a compromise between   the two th.eses0   we recognise the ijtierican principleP which is ofconsiderable value for political reasons both here ^and in America;     while at the same time safeguarding the efficiency of the local administration by givingthe Generals on the spot full latitude to choose between Italians and Allied officers, when the time comes, in the light of local conditions0The overvdhelming argument in favour ofacquiescing in the American view is politicaloIt is very desirable that the Americans should betaking the line? as they are, that we must at all costs avoid a repetition in HUSKYLAM) of thepolitical complications which arose in North Africa.,We do not want to get ourselves into the positionof having opposed the Americans on this point andthen finding political complications arising inHUSKYLxdJD.AoEoForeign Office,   S.W.1,20th May, 1943*

ANNEX,D1L--PT TELLl;-]AM TO HIS MAJESTY&apos; S AMBASSADOR. WASHINGTONoI agree; with American view that concept at which weshould aim is that of a purely military government, but i fear that the War Department underestimate the difficultiesof providing from Allied sources sufficient qualifiedadministrators who understand not only the Italian languageand conditions but also tie intricate working of a foreign civilservioe*   War Office estimate that over 2,000 officers will berequired :;o replace holders of important offices such as Prefectsand Mayors, as against only   about 400 under our proposal02a     In my view therefore we should face the possibility that we may have to fall back on employment of Italians Incertain cases and ciroumstancesc    For the purposes of theproposed directive; following wording would perhaps meet thepointB3*     &quot;All prefects and all mayors of important communitiesshall be removed?,    They shall be replaced by military officersof the occupying forces whenever this can be done without prejudicing the requirement, of the Force Commander that thelocal civil administration should be as efficient as possiblesShould it prove necessary for    administrative or other reasons to j)lace Italians in any of these posts, these will be selected from ame^g subordinate officials, preferably non-Fascist or who if Fascist at all, had only been so in namebecause their livelihood depended on it, and not fromconviction^    It shall be made clear to any Italians soselected and to all governmental officials and employees thattheir retention is solely on basis of satisfactory co-operation,performance and behaviours&quot;4o      Attention of the UoSo Government should be drawn tothese considerations,.    I shall be grateful if you will discussthe matter with the Prime Minister, who may    decide to take it up with the Presidentc50      You should press for inclusion in the directiveitself of our proposed interpretative passage (paragraph 3 ofJ.S.I\ru 938)0    It is not necessary to bother the PrimeMinister wi th this pointo6o      Comments on remainder of JCS.M6 938 will be sentthrough military channels,,
