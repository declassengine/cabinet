THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET. \ / Copy No.   21W.P. (43) 244.15th June, 1943WAR CABINET.THE  RELATION  OF  THE  BRITISH  COMMONWEALTH  TO  THEPOST-WAR INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ORGANISATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THERE are some points in relation to the future position within the BritishCommonwealth of Nations and its position in the international field to which Ishould like to call the attention of my colleagues.2. Our High Commissioner in Canada, in a memorandum which I circulatedrecently as W.P. (43) 115, has set out very clearly the general considerations which arise, and I do not wish to go over the same ground again except to say that -1agree generally with what he has said, and commend his observations to thecareful consideration of the War Cabinet.3. I take it to be a fundamental assumption that, whatever post-war inter-national political organisation is established, it will be our aim to maintain theBritish Commonwealth as an international entity, recognised as such by foreigncountries, in particular by the United States and the Soviet Union. If we are tocarry our full weight in the post-war world with the United States and U.S.S.R.,it can only be as a united British Commonwealth. At the same time, it will benecessary to satisfy the legitimate claim of each of the Dominions to rank in theworld as an independent nation.4. The problem of reconciling these two requirements arises immediately on consideration of the type of organisation to be set up. The question by whatmethod the British Commonwealth is represented in an international political system must depend on what international system we should aim at in the interestsboth of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth as a whole. TheDominions will expect to be represented in some form, their co-operation will be needed in whatever international system is to be established, and it will be hope-less to aim at a system which does not take account of their views. Any proposalfor a system which did not take account of their position would risk forfeitingtheir confidence and co-operation.5:   British Commonwealth representation in an international system.Four possibilities are : (1) Representation of the whole Commonwealth by the United Kingdom.This would be a reversion to the pre-1914 arrangement, before the dominions were regarded as possessing an international status different from that of Colonies.It may be argued that it corresponds with the machinery which has beenestablished since December 1941 for the direction of various war activities ofthe United Nations by combined United Kingdom United States bodies. But,although the Dominions have accepted a &quot; combined &quot; principle in the strategicdirection of the war and for certain other war purposes, they have done so,especially Canada and Australia, with reluctance, and they are most unlikely to[25576] &apos;
agree to its permanent adoption in the post-war world. Their reasons are, briefly,that such an arrangement (a) obscures their independence of status;v (b) denies them the share in the direction of affairs to which they areentitled in virtue of their population and resources and the contribu-^tion they can make to the post-war world organisation;(c) may result in imposing obligations on the Governments and peoples ofthe Dominions without their being consulted.These objections, particularly (a), are not overcome by intra-Imperialconsultation before policy is enunciated and while it is being executed, nor by including Dominion representatives in the United Kingdom representation, as at versailles in 1919.There is the further disadvantage, from the United Kingdom point of view,that such an arrangement does not bring home to the Dominions that they, as wellas: the United Kingdom, have a share in the responsibility for the peace of theWorld.(2) Separate representation of the United Kingdom and of each Dominion.This system, embodying the legal concept of the equality of all States, wasadopted at the League of Nations Assembly and at international Conferences inthe inter-war period. It will be essential to retain it at conferences on technical matters, and there should be no difficulty in retaining it at internationalassemblies open to all the United Nations or all nations of the world. But, once it is necessary to make a selection among the nations, the inclusion of all theDominions is clearly unacceptable to foreign governments.(3) Representation of the Commonwealth by the United Kingdom plus one of theDominions.This system was effectively established on the League of Nations Council, ofwhich the United Kingdom was a permanent member. The Dominions wereeligible for election to non-permanent seats, and after the first few years it alwaysproved possible to ensure that one of them was elected. The Dominion on theCouncil for the time being was not regarded as representing the other Dominions,but the arrangement had the advantage of making plain to foreign countries andto the peoples of the Dominions themselves that the Dominions were independent of the United Kingdom. It has the disadvantage that it is only suitable forbodies in whose appointment a moderate, though not a drastic, degree of selectioncan be exercised, since, if there is a Dominion representative as well as a UnitedKingdom representative, smaller foreign countries consider themselves alsoentitled to claim representation.(4) Representation of the Commonwealth by one member, not necessarily theUnited Kingdom,, nor always the same Member.This method has not yet been tried. At one stage in the negotiations over.the membership of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration,when the United States and Russia were insisting that the members of theCentral Committee must not exceed four and Canada was holding out for membership, the suggestion was tentatively mentioned by the United kingdom to Canada as a pis aller that the &quot;fourth member, besides the United States,the U.S.S.R. and China, should be Canada, rather than the United Kingdom.The Canadian Government at once ruled out this solution. Although theoreticallyattractive as a practical demonstration of the parity of status of the membersof the Commonwealth, it would be open to the disadvantages that  &apos;  (a) The Dominions are more jealous of each other than of the UnitedKingdom and, while in the last resort each may, on occasion, be ,prepared to entrust its interests to the United Kingdom, they havenot, so far, shown any disposition to entrust them to another.Dominion;(b) In almost any^subject which may come before an international body,the Gnited Kingdom has more at stake than any one of the Dominions,and public opinion here would be unlikely to agree to United kingdom interests being represented, by another country, even a Dominion.     v
6. It is, of course, possible&quot; that no satisfactory world settlement will beachieved without considerable modifications in existing political thought in fhetheory and practice of independent sovereignty, both in this country and in theDominions. It may be that in time some system of grouping, involving&apos;1/the surrender of some part of the rights of independent sovereign States may growup. But this development is for the future, and the Dominions cannot fieexpected to lead the way in reversing their progress to independent States.7. Of the alternatives described in paragraph 3, the first, representationof the whole Commonwealth by the United Kingdom, has, from the UnitedKingdom angle, much to commend-it. But, although the wheel may in time comefull circle, the Dominions, who have only in the last generation succesfully assertedtheir status as independent nations, are not likely at present to be convinced thatthe time has come to surrender it.8. It is also probable that, in so far as representation of international bodiescould be organised on a functional basis, Dominion aspirations to an internationalrole would be more easily satisfied. On this basis^ it should be possible to secureDominion recognition of the preponderant interest of the United Kingdom inforeign policy and strategy, whilst the Dominions should, with our support, beable to establish a claim to ampler representation on any international economic-councils concerned with the commodities which they produce; If the post-war world sees a great extension of international co-operation in, e.g., trade, com-munications, nutrition, health and research and in the general control of theresources of the world in the interests of mankind at large, there should be morescope than before the war for international organisations in which the Dominionscould play an independent part on a functional basis.9. Similarly, if provision can be made for problems affecting more directlya particular area to be dealt with on a regional basis, any Dominion in that area would naturally be represented on any regional organisation.10. But probably the most practicable of the above&apos; four alternatives,representing the minimum that would be acceptable to the Dominions and themaximum acceptable to foreign countries, is that, to the greatest possible extent,international committees should comprise a representative of the United kingdom as well as a representative of one Dominion selected for that purpose as beingthe Dominion best qualified to deal with the subject in hand, The Dominionrepresentative would speak only for his own Dominion and the United kingdom representative only for the United Kingdom. But, provided that the system ofBritish Commonwealth co-operation and consultation were working effectively, hewould, in fact, do so with the confidence that his views would be broadly accept-able to the members of the Commonwealth not represented. If arrangements onthese lines were made on a general scale, and full weight given to the functionaland regional considerations described in paragraphs 8 aud 9 above, it would bepossible to obtain Dominion acquiescence in the reservation of the major politico-strategical issues for the major powers only on the argument that security isparticularly a function of the Powers possessing and ready to exercise thenecessary force.. 11. An important consideration would be that all international organisa-tions should in some way be presented as functioning by delegation from the whole body of nations, or from all the United Nations. In such circumstances, the stateof affairs in which Dominions are not separately represented or are not allrepresented would be easier to justify than one in which such bodies wereconstituted by the &quot; major &quot; Powers themselves of their own mere motion.12. It would also be easier to secure acceptance by the Dominions of, theproposal recommended if groups of foreign countries were prepared to delegatetheir representation to a selected member of the group, e.g., if some of thecountries of Western or Central Europe could agree on one &quot;member to present their collective point of view.^ 13. The suggestions in this paper are made with particular reference to canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Their relation to india would need consideration in the light of the international status of India at the
time. Eire would no doubt eventually have to find a place, but this would clearly not arise in the near future. It is assumed that the Colonial Empire would continue to be represented by the United Kingdom, Colonial representatives being included where necessary among the United Kingdom representatives.. 14. These are issues which, subject to the views of the Cabinet, are.eventually for discussion with Dominion Prime Ministers themselves at an early stage. As my colleagues will be aware, the proposal has now been made that an imperial Conference should be held during the course of this year. It would bewell, I suggest, that opportunity should be taken of this gathering to consider and discuss fully the problems which I have outlined above. If any such discussion between Prime Ministers could be preceded by informal andexploratory talks between United Kingdom and Dominion officials in order to clear the ground, it would, I think, be of great advantage.C. R. A.Dominions Office, 15th June, 1943.[Note. The above was in draft before the note of the Prime Minister&apos;sconversations at Washington [W.P. (43) 233] was circulated. But the considerations set out herein must, I suggest, be borne in mind in examining the issues raised in that paper.]
