THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted&apos;for the War Cabinet.  June 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 232.5th June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.MORALE AND THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.IT will be remembered that at the Meeting of the War Cabinet on the morning of the 29th April (W.M. (43) 61st Conclusions) Field-Marshal Wavell raised thequestion of the attitude of the British soldiers and airmen in India towards the continuation of the war against Japan after Germany had been defeated, andthe Prime Minister directed Field-Marshal Wavell to take up the problem with me.Field-Marshal Wavell has explained that the British troops in India werelooking over their shoulder &apos;&apos; and thinking that, when Germnay had been defeated, the war, as far as they were concerned, would be over, and they would return to their homes. The Field-Marshal is doing what he can in India toeradicate this view and to impress upon the British troops that there would be along and hard fight ahead against Japan, in which they would be called uponto play a leading part. But the effect- of any action taken in India on thissubject would be very limited and it is essential, if real success were to be attainedand the morale of the British troops made what it should be, that action shouldalso be taken in this country. In his view it is essential that people in this country should be so imbued with the conviction that after Germany was defeated thefull war effort of the Allied Nations must be turned upon Japan and in this effort the British forces in India would play a major part, that this view wouldbe reflected in letters to soldiers and airmen in India and in newspapers andjournals reaching them. This could only be done if prominence to this aspect ofthe war was given in speeches by Ministers and other prominent persons, andin newspaper articles and broadcast talks.2. In my opinion the question of Service morale after the defeat of Germanycovers a wide field. We should not deal with it only in relation to British troopsin India. Indeed, it might only have a depressing effect upon these troops if,by addressing ourselves too directly and exclusively to them, we gave them theimpression that they and they alone would have to stay in the Army and go onfighting the Japanese after those nearer home have returned to civil life. Thereare many other categories whose war service will not be ended by the defeat ofthe Axis in Europe, e.g., the two other Armed Services, the Merchant Service and various classes of civilians employed overseas. Even the general public inGreat Britain can only look forward to a gradual relaxation of the war-timeregime. And though the Far East will, of course, be the principal and certainlythe most arduous and irksome arena of continued military service, it will not bethe -only .onet...as.. there wiU.be much clearing up to be done and there will be theneed for military occupation in various parts of the World........   .....

3. We must therefore inculcate the idea that while, of course, our firstobject is to defeat Germany, much will remain to -be done, especially in theFar East, in order that the job may be finished once and for all and that peace-loving people all over the world may be assured in the years to come of fullyattaining the object of the sacrifices made by the present generation. It willnot, I think, be difficult in this process of educating our people to avoid playinginto the hands of those in America who favour early and extensive measures against Japan to the possible prejudice of our operations in the West. Indeed,I suggest that it would assist the concentration in the immediate future of ourjoint efforts against the Axis in Europe if we make it as clear as we possiblycan that there will be no relaxation of our efforts when the menace which threatensus more immediately and directly than it threatens America has been removed, andthat the destruction of Japan is no less a part of our whole purpose than thatof Germany and Italy.4. Our object should be to make it clear that Japan is just as much theenemy of the ideals for which we are fighting as are Germany and Italy, andthat the principles at stake in the East are the same as those in the West, and thatit all hangs together. The defeat of Japan is part of the cause for which america is fighting with us in the West and for which we are fighting and must continueto fight with America in the East, and for which Russia and China are alsoengaged in a world-wide effort. Our own kinsmen in Australia and New zealand and in Canada face in the Pacific area the same menace as we have faced inEurope and the Atlantic; they have been holding on, while the common enemy isdisposed of in the Western Hemisphere, much as we held on in 1940-41 tillAmerica was stirred by that common enemy&apos;s blow in the East to join with us;it is up to us to help our fellow-members of the Commonwealth, who are of thesame blood and the same ideals as ourselves, to deal with the enemy threateningthem as they came to our aid in 1939 and 1940. The forces of India herself, aswell as our own forces in India, will be in it together with those of the Dominionsand. let-us-hope, to an increasing extent with those of the Dutch and the French.5. In this way the British, forces in India, on whom undoubtedly much will depend, will be brought to feel that the services that they will be called uponto render are not of a different nature from those which will have resulted in the defeat of Germany and are not directed to a less worthy and inspiring cause; itis not at all a question of merely recovering territory, nor of re-establishingeconomic interests for the benefit of private individuals or concerns. The defeat of Japan is necessary if the full fruits of victory in the West are to be reapedand if the peace of the world is to be established on sure foundations.6. This is what we have got to get understood by the men and equally important by their friends and relatives at home. But there are certain points which will require special attention in order to make it easier for the men serving in the East to digest and reconcile themselves to this unpalatable conception ofwhat is required. In the first place, our forces in the East will naturally expect to be satisfied that such measures as may be practicable are taken to ensureequality of sacrifice. Those who have been far from their homes for a long time will be discontented if we fail to take such measures as may be open to us to replace them with those who have been more fortunate elsewhere. Secondly, if partialdemobilisation occurs and many of those brought into the armed forces for thewar are released to resume their position in civil life, those who have to stay mayhave an undeniable claim to some form of compensation for the additional sacrificethey are being called upon to make. Thirdly, special attention should be givento the provision of amenities which have hitherto been more freely available tothose nearer home, including postal facilities which, indeed, form an invaluablemedium for putting across in the form least savouring of &quot;propaganda&quot; theunderstanding of the situation as sketched in paragraph 5 provided that thatunderstanding has been properly taken by the people at home. Fourthly, weshould consider whether any assurance as to their prospects can be given to those whose return to civil life will, be delayed, and what steps are possible to safeguardtheir interests in this respect.7. If my proposal meets with general approval, it will need to be worked out in detail as to the matter and method of its presentation. I suggest that theWar Cabinet should set up a committee, under a Ministerial chairman, withrepresentatives from the various departments concerned, for the purpose of considering the need for cultivating the state of morale necessary to ensure the
completion of our military operations after the defeat of the Axis in Europe,and the best means of achieving the required results. .8. The same objective faces us in relation to the Indian forces, on whom a great share in the continuing task of waging war against Japan will fall. Themethods to be adopted will no doubt need adj ustment to Indian needs, and thatwill be my and the Government of India&apos;s responsibility. But I doubt whether there is much hope of discharging it successfully unless the British public takethe required attitude and unless the British forces in India can be prevented from&quot;looking over their shoulders.&quot;9. The First Lord, the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary ofState for Air concur generally in this memorandum. The Minister for Informa-tion has, I understand, doubts as to the desirability of setting up at present theCommittee suggested in paragraph 7.L. S. A.India Office, 5th June, 1943.
