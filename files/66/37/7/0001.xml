The presence of numbers of Spanish trawlers in the declared area, despiterecent broadcast warnings, is a serious impediment to aircraft on anti-submarinepatrol, causing them to lose about 10 per cent, of their effort.Very shortly it is expected that the French tunnymen will start fishingalso. We are anxious to avoid shooting up these Frenchmen, since they are mostlyBretons friendly to our cause.3. The inconvenience of the presence of these vessels in the Bay was onlyseverely felt towards the latter end of the season last year, and instructions were then issued that the French tunnymen could be attacked without warning in the declared areas west of the line indicated on the attached chart. Neutral fishing vessels, however, were to be attacked throughout the sink-at-sight area indicatedseparately.4. At a later stage, an attempt was made to capture a proportion of thetunny fleet, but in fact the operation took place too late in the year and only some three vessels were secured.5.   The. following action is being taken this year : (a) Leaflets have been dropped on the tunny ports.(b) Leaflets will be dropped over a limited period on any- tunnymen found at sea and, at the same time, warning shots will be fired.(c) After that limited period, tunnymen will be attacked without warningin the area described in (d) below.(d) The area in which tunnymen may be attacked at sight is being extendedto cover the south-eastern portion of the Bay, leaving only a limitedarea of free water off the coast for inshore fishermen (see attachedchart).6. Spanish and other neutral fishing vessels will, however, be liable to attackthroughout the whole sink-at-sight area. Indeed, our present standinginstructions, which date back to July 1942, permit such attacks. The naval attache, Madrid, has been asked to ensure that all authorities concerned are aware of the warning to fishermen which was broadcast on the 20th April, and,in addition, leaflets are being prepared for dropping on any Spanish trawlers-encountered. These will inform the fishermen that on and after the 1st Junefishing vessels found in the area will be attacked and sunk without further-warning.7. The Foreign Office have expressed concurrence in the. above proposals.,which have been noted with approval by the anti-U-Boat Committee.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1,*.
