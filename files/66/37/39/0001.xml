The Secretary of State for India has recently put to the War Cabinet a paper(WP(43)232) in which he draws attention to the feeling that appears to exist among theBritish troops in India that once the war with Germany and Italy is won, the war sofar as they are concerned will be over and they can return to their homes. He urgesin this paper the necessity for eradicating this idea and impressing upon not only thetroops in India, but upon the nation as a whole the fact that Japan is as much theenemy as Germany and that until she is defeated the war is not and cannot be over.In short, he stresses the importance of stimulating the national morale towards wagingwar with Japan until that country is completely defeated. The Admiralty are alsoapprehensive as to the effects upon their naval personnel of continued service in the far east and feel the need for fortifying the will to fight against Japan after the defeat ofthe Axis in Europe. I agree that propaganda to this end is highly desirable and isultimately the only possible means of achieving the object in view, but I wouldemphasize that such propaganda should be based not merely upon the necessity, ofdefeating Japan as an indispensable preliminary to peace, but also upon the theme thatour destiny as a great Imperial power in the future as in the past, demands that weBritish should recover, stabilize and develop our Imperial possessions in the East.Moreover, we should remind our countrymen that Australia and New Zealand madegreat sacrifices and took grave risks in coming to our aid when we were hard pressedin the West by that same evil of aggression which now in another but no less formidableand dynamic manifestation threatens the East and will, unless finally and utterlydefeated, spread over the whole world.2. There is, however, one essential factor in the maintenance of morale amongstthe fighting Services and that is the ideas that are prevalent in their minds on the subject and prospects of demobilization. This paper is directed to draw attention to certain difficulties involved in the accepted scheme for demobilization which affect the Army ina particular degree and to perhaps a greater extent than the other two Services.3. The general scheme approved by the Government for the demobilization of theforces of the three Services was framed to a large extent on the assumption that the war would end in all theatres at approximately the same date and that consequentiy an orderly system of demobilization could be applied to troops in ail theatres alike.4. The probability, however, that the defeat of Germany and Italy will precede the defeat of Japan and that it will be necessary for our forces to continue the war in&apos; theFar East while, as the Prime Minister stated in his broadcast on 21st March, 1943,&quot; there will certainly be a partial demobilization following on the defeat of Hitler &quot;,has introduced problems and difficulties which were absent from the original conception of demobilization. The object must be to find some solution of these difficulties which,while maintaining the general principles of the existing scheme, will provide at any ratea partial, if not complete, alleviation of a situation containing the possibilities of serious trouble.5. The common thread which runs through all these difficulties is briefly the retention-tion on foreign service of men who will have been separated from their homes forprotracted periods, while other men who have not served abroad at all, or have onlyserved abroad for short periods, are being demobilized. Under the demobilizationscheme as it exists at present no extra weight attaches to service overseas per se ascompared with service at home.
6. This issue has been raised in different quarters from different aspects. All-ofthose who have raised the issue have naturally viewed it from their own angle of visionand any suggestions that are made tend only to touch one point of a problem whichcannot be divided in this way but must be dealt with as a whole.7. Certain Members of Parliament have sponsored the claims of the armies in north Africa to have some priority of demobilization in respect of their services in that theatre, and it is understood that there is a Parliamentary Committee on Demobilizationwhich leans towards the view that additional weight should be given for overseas service;particularly, it is understood, for service in actual theatres of operation. In this respectit is worth bearing in mind that if a large number of the troops now serving in thiscountry land on the continent and are engaged in severe fighting, the feeling of disparityand inequity of treatment existing in the minds of those now serving overseas maytend to disappear.8. General Alexander has suggested that a percentage of the First and EighthArmies should be brought home and replaced by a similar number of soldiers from home Forces. His object in making this suggestion is rather to stiffen the forces now serving at home by introducing among them men who have had battle experience; but of course this would also provide relief for those who have been serving in North Africa.9. The Adjutant-General, who has recently returned from India, feels that there isconsiderable disquietude among British troops who are mainly employed upon theuncongenial task of internal security and who fear that they may be left marooned andforgotten after the war in Europe is over, while their comrades in the western hemisphereare being demobilized. He also considers that there is need for some publicity ondemobilization to be combined with the propaganda measures outlined in paragraph. 1above.10. As.I have^ indicated above, these difficulties all have a common thread runningthrough them and they all impinge from different angles upon our demobilization policy as a whole.- After considering the question with my advisers I feel confident that the onlysatisfactory solution in so far as the Army is concerned, is to accelerate the system, onwhich w.e have already made a start, of relieving those individuals who have servedabroad for the longest period.At present this system is confined to the return of those regular soldiers who havea claim to be brought back after serving 6 years abroad. We should complete the years&apos; men as quickly as possible, then bring back all those with over 5 years&apos;, over4 years&apos;, etc., etc., thus introducing a general roulement of reliefs. This would mean that when the war with Germany finished the hardest cases of prolonged separationwould have been dealt with and would be at home, and the eventual problem wouldbe correspondingly diminished.It is unnecessary to point out that any such scheme must be begun soon. In orderto achieve an appreciable result it must be in operation as long as possible beforehostilities cease in Europe.Such a scheme would not result in the earlier demobilization of the men brought back, but it would relieve the hardship of prolonged separation from home, and would thus weaken any claim for prior demobilization on the ground of service overseas, sinceonce these men were back in the United Kingdom, their claim to priority of demobili-zation over those who had suffered no separation from home through overseas service would be largely discounted. The scheme, moreover, would not impair the general principles of the existing demobilization plan, which it is highly desirable to maintainas far as possible intact.11. The operation of the scheme depends, of course, upon the availability ofshipping and it is not possible to produce off-hand any useful estimate of the tonnagerequired. Although statistics are available showing the existing figures of army personnel with any given number of years&apos; continuous service, overseas, any question ofshipping availability immediately touches the requirements of the other Services andany estimate will involve detailed consideration by the Departments interested in thelight of strategical and other considerations.12. Finally, I think that in view of what I have said above it will be agreed thatthere should exist some piece of interdepartmental machinery whereby the various departments, Service and others, concerned in demobilization problems can, in con-sultation, co-ordinate and formulate proposals on matters of common interest for submission to Ministers. My Department has already suggested that the Interdepart-mental.Committee originally, presided over by. Sir G. Chrystal and later by Sir A. Hurst,. which..is.now.in abeyance, should, be reconstituted in a slightly modified form for thispurpose.-- Such.a. Committee would also be the body best suited to advise on the desirabilityand extent, of publicity in regard to demobilization policy.&apos;    &quot; &apos;;; . &quot;    &apos;   P. J.
