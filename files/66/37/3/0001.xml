INDIA.Mr. GANDHI&apos;S REQUEST TO SEE Mr. JINNAH.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate herewith the text of a letter which Mr. Gandhi has asked theGovernment of India to forward to Mr. Jinnah (Appendix I). It purports to respond to an &quot; invitation &quot; made in the latter&apos;s speech to the Moslem LeagueConference on the 24th April. The relevant extract is given in Appendix II,together with further points from the speech as reported by Reuter. TheViceroy&apos;s appreciation of the issues raised and his proposals for dealing withthe matter is given in Appendix III.2. The Viceroy&apos;s main point is that we cannot afford to allow ourselves, in face of&apos;repeated expressions of our desire for a settlement, to be fixed with responsibility for the continuance of the present deadlock or accused ofdeliberately sabotaging constructive efforts to end it by one or other of theprincipal parties. Gandhi occupies the most comfortable position in this matter;he has nothing to lose and will be quick to take advantage of the consequenceswhether we withhold or forward the letter. If we refuse to forward it, bothGandhi and Jinnah will fasten the blame on us. If we send it on, it is likely tobe an embarrassment to Jinnah, for it is non-committal on Pakistan. He maynot be able to ignore it, but he must see the danger to his own ascendancy andto the principles of Pakistan which any settlement with Congress would involve.The Viceroy, in short, thinks it very improbable that Gandhi&apos;s move will resultwithin any measurable time in a Congress-Moslem League settlement, though there may be consequences causing embarrasment to Government. These, he thinks, must be faced, and is prepared to face them. But his main point is that,believing as he does that the negotiations which might result from allowingGandhi and Jinnah to meet would be quite infructuous, it would at once serveour present purpose of maintaining the status quo until the war with Japan iswon and post-war constitution making can begin, and save us from the odium ofwrecking in advance an attempt to bridge the Congress-Moslem League gulf, to let the letter be delivered. His Council have not yet been informed of the matterbut must be taken into confidence very shortly, and he expects that the Indianmembers will be disinclined to face the consequences of refusing to forwardGandhi&apos;s letter. The Viceroy thinks the present issue can be readilydistinguished from the recent unsuccessful requests to make contact with Gandhi,which were declined either because the persons concerned had no politicalfollowing (Rajagopalachari, &amp;c), or because it was impossible to discriminatein favour of a foreign representative (Mr. Phillips).3.   Paragraph 15 of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram summarises his conclusions.[25434] BPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1943.20SECRET. Copy No.- 1W.P. (43) 203.May 14, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
4. As I see it, we have decided, for the time being at any rate, that gandhi and the Congress leaders have put themselves out of court by their action, andthat, unless and until they show some sign of a change of heart, or at least of a recognition that their own policy has failed, they should be kept entirely discon-nected, and that any political negotiations that may take place must take place without them.5. If Gandhi is. allowed to write to, and consequently see, Jinnah thatdecision is, in fact, reversed. There can be no resisting the obviously reasonablefurther demand that the Congress Working Committee should also join in thediscussion, Or, indeed, anyone else whom Gandhi might wish to see. Nothing inJinnah&apos;s speech or in Gandhi&apos;s reply would suggest that there is any prospect ofany sort of agreement or that the discussions could lead to anything exceptadvertising Gandhi and Jinnah.6. I am not impressed by the distinction which the Viceroy draws&apos; between his proposed concession in the case of Jinnah and his refusal in the case ofPhillips or of other Indian politicians. I think the American public will almost certainly be annoyed and our own public puzzled. I am strengthened in myreluctance to make this concession to Jinnah in view of the truculent tone of his speech, in which he says that the Government will not &apos;&apos; have the daring to stopsuch a letter if it is sent to me. It will be a most serious thing if such a letter isstopped.&quot;7. My own advice to the Viceroy would be to stop the letter and to tell his council that he has done so in pursuance of the general policy approved of bythem. The fact that this has been done should at the same time be made public and justified by reference to the Government of India&apos;s general policy and to theaction taken in previous cases.L. S. A.India Office, May 14, 1943.
Mr. Gandhi&apos;s Letter to Mr. Jinnah, dated May 4.Dear Quaid-i-Azam,When, some time alter my incarceration, Government asked me for a list of newspapers I would like to have, I included Dawn in my list. I have been receiving it with more or less regularity. Whenever it come [sic&apos;\ to me, I was(corrupt group) careful. I have followed the proceedings of League as reportedin Dawn columns. I have noted your invitation to me to write to you. Hencethis letter.I welcome your invitation. I suggest our meeting face to face rather thantalking through correspondence.  But I am in your hands.I hope that this letter will be sent to you, and, if you agree to my proposal,that the Government will let you visit me.One thing I had better mention. There seems to be an &quot;if&quot; about yourinvitation. Do you say I should write only if I have changed my heart? Godalone knows men&apos;s hearts.  I would like you to take me as I am.Why should not both you and I approach the great question of communalunity as men determined on finding a common solution and work together to make our solution acceptable to all who are concerned with it or are interested in it ? Yours sincerely, M. K. Gandhi.APPENDIX II.Mr. Jinnah&apos;s Invitation in his Speech of April 24.Nobody would welcome it more than myself if Mr. Gandhi is even now reallywilling to come to a settlement with the Moslem League on the basis of Pakistan.Let me tell you that it will be the greatest day both for the Hindus andthe Mussulmans. If he has made up his mind, what is there to preventMr. Gandhi from writing direct to me? He is writing letters to the Viceroy.Why does he not write to me direct? Who is there that can prevent him from doing so ? What is the use of going to the Viceroy and leading deputations and carrying on correspondence ? Who is to prevent Mr. Gandhi to-day ? I cannotbelieve for a single moment strong as this Government may be in this country you may say anything you like against this Government I cannot believe thatthey will have the daring to stop such a letter if it is sent to me.&apos;&apos; It will be a very serious thing indeed if such a thing is done by the Govern-ment. But I do not see evidence of any kind of change of policy on the part ofMr. Gandhi or Congress or Hindu leadership.&quot;Further points from the speech as reported by Renter were : &quot;Mr. Gandhi gets all information and knows what.is gping on.&quot; If there is any change of heart on his part, and he informs me, the moslem league will not fail, whatever may have been our controversy in the past.&quot; Let us sit as two equals and come to a settlement. That is now the problemof problems.  &apos;&quot; How oan you keep on saying that it is the British who have kept us apart \Of course I grant that the British take advantage of our folly. But we havedevices of our own which are better than any devices the British government can fashion to keep us disunited.&quot; Why should not the country say : &apos; Unite and drive the British out.&apos; Itis of no use appealing to the other nations of the world.&quot; Whatever may be our views, there is no doubt that India is in the war. Isit more in the interests of the British and the United Nations, or, is it more inour interest that we should be reduced to the position of helpless spectators ?Who is more likely than we Indians to suffer from defeat?&quot; It is therefore dishonest on the part of the British Government to say thatwe are not co-operating in the war effort.&quot;Mr. Jinnah argued that the British Government had declared Congress arebel organisation, but had done nothing as regards the rest of India, despite the&apos; [25434] . &apos; &apos;      &apos; B 2
fact that they said they were anxious to move in the direction of handing overpower to the people.&quot; That means you are successfully being held up by Congress. It is aconfession of failure on your part.&quot; People in India either back Congress or not. If the overwhelming majoritydo not and one hundred million Moslems certainly do not then what is youranswer ?&quot; The British say that in resisting Congress they are protecting us, but wedo not agree, because we do not believe they love us so much. If there is agree-ment between Moslems and Hindus, then the British Government know that thenet result will be that they will have to part with power.&quot; If we cannot secure power as a United India, let us get it as a dividedIndia.&quot;With regard to the war effort, Mr. Jinnah said : &quot; We are accused of nothelping the war effort, and are threatened by the Government that &apos; those who arenot with us are against us.&apos;&quot; I say that as far as Moslem India and the Moslem League are concerned,our cup of bitterness is nearly full.&quot; Once more I draw the British Governments attention to the situation,which is very^ serious. I inform them from this platform that the bitterness anddisappointment and shabby treatment meted out to Muslim India is a danger tothem.&quot;Therefore reconsider your position; guarantee the Moslem right to self-determination; and pledge yourselves to abide by the plebiscite of Moslems forPakistan.&quot;Referring to Mr. Gandhi&apos;s civil disobedience movement, Mr. Jinnah said :&quot;If it had been our own Government, I would have put these people in gaol inorder-to prevent a powerful organisation from letting loose an anti-war campaign.&quot; Pakistan was imperative, and it was no good having a loose federation,&quot; hesaid. &quot;There is no such thing as a loose federation; when the Central Govern-ment is established, it will tighten until the units are reduced to the same status as the Indian States have now.&quot; We are opposed to any such scheme, which is bound eventually to lead tothe emasculation of the entire Moslem nation, socially, educationally, culturally,economically and politically, and to the establishment of a Hindu Governmentin this sub-continent. Therefore dismiss from your minds any idea of this kind which might lure you.&quot;APPENDIX III.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated May 13, 1943.1159-S.Personal. I have telegraphed separately text of letter received from Gandhifor forwarding to Jinnah. It has been received under covering letter fromGandhi to my Home Department, and it has been forwarded through the Govern-ment of Bombay. &quot; Invitation &quot; from Jinnah to which it purports to reply is contained in my immediately succeeding telegram.*2. Our present policy vis-a-vis of Congress is (as was clear toRajagopalachari) that Gandhi and Congress must resile from their attitude oflast year and give satisfactory assurances before business can be done with them.Our present general policy is, as exemplified by our attitude towards theProvincial Ministries, that it is a precondition of invitation to any individualto assist a Governor in forming a Provincial Ministry that any &quot;Ministry soformed must be prepared to give fullest support to war effort.3. In the case of Gandhi there have been at least 3 recent attempts to make contact with him.(a) Rajagopalachari&apos;s attempt of last November.(&amp;) The approaches that have been made to -me by Phillips.(c) The recent deputation from Rajagopalachari and other persons on behalfof No Parties Conference.* First two paragraphs of Appendix II.   .
4. In the case of (a) I declined (informing my Council subsequently) on theground substantially that Rajagopalachari represented nobody but himself.5. In the case of (&amp;) I declined, since it was in my judgment quite impossibleto discriminate in favour of the representative of a foreign country when we had declined to allow Indians themselves to contact Gandhi; as undesirable to giveGandhi advertisement involved; and since in any event I regarded it as highlyimproper that the personal representative of the head of a foreign country shouldbe given special facilities to interview a man who was in detention forendeavouring to organise a rebellion. Phillips has now, .of course, stated publicly that he has been refused permission to see Gandhi. Matter has not been mentioned to or discussed in my Council, which showed no interest in it with the exceptionof Srivastava, who has expressed personal doubts to me but did not pursue them.6. In the case of (c) I made it clear that it was open to Gandhi to expresshis regret and repentance for what had taken place, and to give suitable,assurance for the future, and that in that event matter could be - considered further. But it was made clear that initiative rested with Gandhi and that ifhe wanted to make such communication, to me there was nothing to prevent him from doing so. I made it clear also that the persons who approached me on behalfof the No Parties Conference represented nobody but themselves, were in no sense generally representative, and. did not represent a solid platform on which to work. I did not consult my Council (? before) replying to deputation, sincemy reply was in line with policy to which my Council and I have been working.7.   I review below position arising out of Gandhi&apos;s new letter to Jinnah.8. I would premise that there is, in my judgment, no analogy betweenforwarding to Jinnah of a reply from Gandhi himself to a public challenge orinvitation by Jinnah, and a request by irresponsible individuals such asRajagopalachari or members of Bombay Conference to be allowed to see gandhi and discuss future with him; or again an approach by a person such as Phillipswho is not directly concerned, and who represents a foreign country. Jinnahis after all the leader of the second most important party in India. Our settled policy has been not to stand in the way of anything that should reasonablyfacilitate advance towards a settlement, and you have yourself repeatedlyindicated in Parliament anxiety of His Majesty&apos;s Government to see a settle-ment. I would not myself have anticipated any difficulty in such circumstances in justifying forwarding of this communication and of any reply from Jinnah.And I regard it as of great importance that we should avoid being manoeuvredinto a position in which responsibility for continuance of the deadlock can withany plausibility be maintained at our door.9. I now proceed to analyse the position. So far as Gandhi is concernedJinnah may prove to have exposed, an uncomfortable amount of surface by his speech and Gandhi characteristically has been swift to seize the opportunityoffered to him by Jinnah&apos;s challenge. That challenge is more welcome to ghandi because the stock of Gandhi and Congress is at present so low, thefall in their popularity has been so rapid, and damage done to them by ourhandling of the rebellion of gandhis fast and of deputation from No PartiesConference has been so great that it is essential from Gandhi&apos;s point of viewto do something to get back into the limelight; and,, he is, of course, on verycomfortable ground as regards Jinnah on the one hand, and the Government onthe other, in his present approach. If (? Government) decline to forward his letter to Jinnah they expose themselves to charge that they are standing in theway of a settlement (it is relevant that while I could decline to forward his letterto Jinnah without consulting my Council as to my decision on ground, that I was(1 merely) applying policy to which they and I have been working I would not regard it as wise or desirable to do so; but in any event they will have to be brought in very early and I comment further on this in para. 15 (g) below).10. Gandhi hopes no doubt also that if we decide not to forward letter weshall play into Jinnah&apos;s hands and make ourselves a target for Jinnah. If, onthe other hand, we do forward it, it may place Jinnah in an awkward position,and it is certainly likely to present the Government with difficult questions of tactics whether Jinnah responds to it or not. If Jinnah were to show signs ofresponding, Gandhi no doubt hopes to be in a position to bring pressure on us to let him out on conditions such as he could not otherwise have hoped for.  He has
nothing to lose in any circumstances by the move he has made, and he will be fullyalive to the possible&quot; advantage he can derive as a result of that move from (a) An arrangement with Moslems to take office.(6) Placing, without any question arising of taking office, Government and moslem League alike in a difficult position with progressive opinionhere, at home and in United States.(c) A scrap with Jinnah before public.(d) Even a snub from Jinnah and chance thereafter, once the facts become known, of dubbing Jinnah a die-hard. And, as usual, he has been atparticular pains not to commit himself on any point of substance, andin particular on Pakistan, despite the fact that Jinnah&apos;s &quot; invita-tion &quot; is to come to a settlement with Moslem League &quot; on the basisof Pakistan.&quot; Gandhi in a word is in much the most comfortableposition of any of the parties to this problem.11. As for Jinnah, I should have thought -that he and the Moslem Leagueprobably in their hearts would prefer things to stay as they are. They have nothing to gain by assuming any responsibilities for the war effort, or for Govern-ment of hereafter. They have everything to gain by leaving present Governmentto carry out that responsibility (including liability for protecting Mosleminterests, for imposing taxation, &quot;for running the war effort, &amp;c), while avoiding a definition of Pakistan or the facing of the practical difficulties in implementingof a Pakistan scheme. Gandhi&apos;s letter, particularly as it does not commit itselfabout Pakistan, is most unlikely to be acceptable to Jinnah, though it may result,once its existence becomes known, in a certain amount of pressure on him fromfollowers who see in it a chance to take office. On the other hand,&quot;were weto hold up the letter, we should, I am sure, play into Jinnah&apos;s hands just as muchas we should play into Gandhi&apos;s. He would certainly resent loss of face involvedin our accepting his public challenge to suppress a communication from Gandhito himself.12. Jinnah will in any event, I anticipate, be found anxious to abuseGovernment, as a shield against charge of being pro-British. My-own feeling isthat likelihood of any arrangement between him and Gandhi is negligible.Pakistan is now fundamental with Moslems, and I should be greatlysurprised if Gandhi himself were prepared to agree to any formula that Jinnahwould accept. Even if he did there would be a serious risk of a split inHindu camp, in which Hindu Mahasabha are already showing signs of muchuneasiness at possibility of a deal between Gandhi and Jinnah. As for possibilityof any intermediate solution, such as. an agreement between Gandhi and Jinnahto shelve Pakistan until the end of the war, and to ask for a Government inwhich Jinnah and Congress would divide their seats fifty-fifty (possibly with an understanding as regards the minorities that Jinnah would have a say as regardsselection of representatives), I would expect Jinnah to be very nervous ofrepercussions of any such arrangements on Provinces where his wicket is notparticularly good. Any serious disturbance of mind among Moslem minorityprovinces would stress their impending fate under Pakistan and might gravelyprejudice Jinnah&apos;s long-term tactics. And while Jinnah might, for all that, find that I (? could not) flatly (? omission) to reject any scheme which had the look ofSwaraj without grave risk to Moslem interests, he knows quite well that anarrangement with Congress, whatever its nature, must in the end be fatal to hisown ascendancy and to Pakistan, and rest of his present creed and platform.I would anticipate, therefore, that he would try to keep clear and leave the babyto be carried by Government.13. So far as Government are concerned Congress at the moment are beatenand disheartened. Jinnah and Moslem League are free with their criticisms :but I would anticipate no difficulty in holding position so far as they areconcerned. I am dear myself that it would suit us best to preserve status quohere until war with Japan is won, and post-war discussions, to which we arealready committed, can take, place. But our hand is not an easy one, and we must play it with great care. Here it is essential to avoid allowing so-called&quot; Progressive &quot; opinion (including at this stage The Times) at home, and inUnited States of America, to fix on us, however unjustly, responsibility forcontinuance of deadlock, or to suggest we are deliberately sabotaging constructiveefforts by one or other of principal Indian parties.14. Finally, we must give full weight to position and attitude of my council.  At one stage or other they will have to be brought in on this business.
I cannot be quite certain what their reaction will be. I should be surprised if intheir hearts any of them wanted to make way for a Congress-Moslem LeagueGovernment.&apos; They are sharply divided communally, and I suspect that Hinduelement is as hostile to Moslem League as the Moslem element is to Congress orto what they call &quot;Hindu Raj.&quot; They are.all of course (omitting Europeans)politicians; they have their political futures to safeguard : and while I have nodoubt that they would be ready to take a lead from me, I would expect that theywould, human nature being what it is, be anxious to safeguard their own personalpositions vis-a-vis of publication, and be anxious if possible to avoid shoulderingresponsibility for a decision which could be misinterpreted.15.   My own view on a reassessment of whole position is as follows : (a) I would let Jinnah have Gandhi&apos;s letter, under an official covering letterfrom Home Department to effect that this had been received fromGandhi and was being passed to him; and that if he wished to send ^a reply to Gandhi, arrangements would be made to forward it, butthat no publicity had been given to receipt of letter, or would be givento its receipt or to receipt of any reply from Jinnah, unless in the outcome that was the wish of both parties.(&amp;) I would give Jinnah no hint of what our response would be to a request from him to be allowed to see Gandhi.(c) If and when Jinnah were to reply asking if he could see Gandhi, I wouldmyself be prepared to let him see him.(d) If (which I think unlikely) (? there) were to be any likelihood of businessbeing done between Gandhi and Jinnah we should have to make it clear at appropriate time that we could consider no arrangement which didnot involve the participants in any Government giving fullest support- to war. Equally, it would have to be made clear by Congress thatthey had abandoned their&apos; policy of last year. This latter point is tosome extent covered by former. If Congress were parties to anarrangement ail parties to which were committed to 100 per cent,active support for war, it would in effect be a recantation, though weshould probably wish to make the recantation specific. But I doubt the advisability of elaborating that point at this stage, since it(corrupt group)s to me like being a very long way ahead, if, indeed,it ever arises.(e) In justifying allowing Jinnah to communicate with  Gandhi whenPhillips, Rajagopalachari, &amp;c, have been kept out, I would take theline suggested in paragraph No. 8 above.(/) If this correspondence between. Jinnah and Gandhi comes to nothing Iwould continue to keep Gandhi (and Working Committee) incom-municado. (I do not overlook that, if war with Japan were to lastanother three years, a situation might so develop as to make it difficultor undesirable to keep Gandhi shut up and cut off from world forall time. But here, again, I see no point in trying to take fences before we have reached them. Everything will turn on circumstances oftime.) .(g) I have carefully considered and have discussed with Maxwell, at whatpoint my Council should be put in the picture. In result, I think rightanswer will be to take them into confidence once I have the cabinet decision; and, on assumption (? that) that decision accepts my recom-mendations, before letter is sent on to Jinnah. There are serious risks of leakage once I tell Council, and leakage would play into Gandhi&apos;shands by giving him the advance publicity he wants. It might also give Jinnah an excuse for breaking (? off) discussions with Gandhi onthe ground that he had been placed in an impossible position. nor can (? we) exclude the possibility that, if Jinnah decides to return a negative reply to Gandhi,,he might be anxious to keep the existence of correspondence secret as long as possible. On the whole, however,I think we had better take our chance, and I would do all I could to impress on my colleagues importance from (I every) point of view,and not least their own, of complete secrecy while situation develops.We must accept it that it will be almost impossible to ensure secrecyas regards Gandhi&apos;s move for any material (? length) of time andleakage from any source, or disclosure by Jinnah once (? letter) reaches
him (and I would not exclude (1 that) possibility if he thought it suitedhis book), might create a very embarrassing situation for us and give me a much more difficult Council to handle. I think, therefore, thatwe had better face up to it (? at once). I think I can probably in that(? event) keep Council on right line, and I will, of course, do my best.16. To sum up, there are certain risks in passing this letter on. But Ithink they should be taken, and that is my advice to Cabinet. In my judgmentthere are far more risks involved in suppression. There are also certainillogicalities in position that results if we do pass the letter on. But they donot worry me and I am quite prepared to accept them. We may (? have) someembarrassing questions of tactics to handle i*f things go better between Jinnahand Gandhi than I myself expect them to do. But it is (? no) good -trying tosettle those in advance, and we must wait and do our best in the light of situation as it develops.&apos; 17. I should be grateful for earliest possible reply as I do not want to delaythis business unnecessarily. But I do not think another week need make anyspecial difference.
