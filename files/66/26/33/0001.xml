Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECRET.. -   Copy No.W.P. (42) 303. /,7^18,1942.WAR CABINET.CONSCRIPTION OF BRITISH SUBJECTS IN EGYPT.Memorandum by the Secretary of Slate for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for War.HIS Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo has represented strongly the view ofall the British authorities in Egypt, including the Service Commanders and leading members of the British civilian community, that the necessary steps should be taken immediately to enable British civilians in Egypt to be conscriptedfor military service or to be directed to perform part-time civil defence duties.Voluntary effort is said to be exhausted and compulsory powers required, both forthe sake of the additional man-power urgently required in the present emergency and as a proof to our Allies and the Egyptians that British resources are being fully mobilised for the war.2. Sir Miles Lampson has forwarded proposals for this purpose which are designed to cover all British subjects in Egypt (men and women), though herecognises that for constitutional reasons Dominion and Indian British subjectsmay have to be excluded. The bulk of the British subjects concerned originatefrom the United Kingdom, Malta or Cyprus and the following figures have been supplied of the numbers of persons concerned, which are exclusive of those already in the armed&apos; forces, but apparently inclusive of those already engaged in civil defence: Men.        Women.United Kingdom ......      3,100 3,200Maltese   ............      3,200 3,500Cypriot............      2,500 1,5003. The proposal submitted from Cairo is that all these persons should berequired to register, that their cases should then be examined individually bylocal Boards (on which the Embassy, the Services and the local British commu-nities would be represented), which would then decide whether the individualshould be called up for whole-time service in the armed forces or the Women&apos;auxiliary Services, or allotted to part-time compulsory civil defence duties, orexempted on account of the importance of their civilian work or for personalreasons. An appeal from the local Boards to a Central Board is proposed. Theidea is that all persons on whom notices are served calling on them to join the armed forces will be immediately subject to British military law under the Army,&amp;c., Acts and exempt from Egyptian jurisdiction under our Treaty arrangements with Egypt. Therefore, so far as service in the armed forces is concerned, themeasure can be enforced in Egypt. Sir Miles Lampson considers that theEgyptian Government, who already permit the authorities of certain AlliedGovernments in Egypt to enforce their own conscription laws, would have noobjection to arrangements on these lines. Service in civil defence cannot in any event be directly enforced locally in Egypt, but Sir M. Lampson considers that,)i it is made compulsory by the Government of the United Kingdom, a great improvement will be effected.11804   [24117]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOY^ERNMEnV
4. On the evidence submitted by Sir Miles Lampson, there is a case for theapplication of compulsion to British subjects in Egypt. The gain in man-power will be relatively small, although in the present emergency in Egypt all availablesources of British man-power should clearly be utilised to the full. The real case for these proposals is moral and political. There is evidence that the absence of conscription on the British community hitherto has led to considerable criticismamong the more zealous sections of the British community and among the Alliedcommunities, and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief has expressed the fear that it will make an adverse impression on visiting United States and Russianmissions. In short, conscription is required to place the British effort in Egypton a full war-time basis.5. So far as civil defence duties are- concerned, there is power under theEmergency Powers Defence Act to make a Defence Regulation compelling Britishsubjects in Egypt to perform these services, and we recommend that such a defence regulation applicable to Egypt only should be made. It is convenient and more suitable to deal with the civil defence duties separately from conscription intothe armed forces, which, according to the Attorney-General&apos;s advice, will have tobe done by Act of Parliament. Defence Regulations have already been madeapplying to British subjects abroad, e.g., compelling British employees of theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company, &amp;c, in Persia to remain at their employment.6. The kernel of Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s proposal is, however, the impositionon British subjects in Egypt of an obligation to perform military service. It is assumed that Parliament would insist upon this being done by extending to theBritish subjects concerned the obligations contained in the United KingdomNational Service Acts, subject to the necessary modifications in procedure, butretaining the rights accorded to the individual by those Acts in the matters ofconscientious objection and postponement of service on grounds of hardship.7. On the assumption that there is no question of an immediate generalextension of United Kingdom conscription to all British subjects residing outsidethis country, the Bill could take one of the following forms :  (a) A Bill enabling the United Kingdom National Service Acts to beextended by Order in Council to British subjects resident in anyparticular country or territory overseas, including the colonial dependencies, but excluding the Dominions, the Bill being immediatelyapplied to Egypt in the first place as a special and urgent case; or(b) A Bill enabling the Acts to be extended by Order in Council to Britishsubjects resident in foreign countries only, i.e., excluding any territorywithin the British Empire,^) the Bill being applied to Egypt in thefirst place as under (a); or(c) A Bill extending the Acts specifically to British subjects in Egypt alone and authorising the detailed procedure required to be laid down byOrder in Council.Whichever form is adopted the Bill will be a short one, leaving details to bedealt with by Order in Council. For the reasons given below we recommend, (b).8.   The following are arguments against the adoption of course (a)&apos;: (i) It is unnecessary to take by Act of Parliament these powers in respectof British subjects in the Colonial Dependencies because in all casesconscription can be enforced by local legislation and in some caseshas already been so imposed.(ii) If such power is taken by Act of Parliament there might be demands forthe application of conscription by United Kingdom Order in Councilin particular Colonial Dependencies where its imposition might beconsidered undesirable or unnecessary,(iii) In particular, there would be agitation for the imposition of conscriptionin Palestine by the advocates of a Jewish Army. (In fact, it wouldbe a breach of the Mandate to conscript Palestinians for service otherthan the defence of Palestine, whether such conscription were imposedunder United Kingdom Act of Parliament or by local legislation.)(l) Palestine and other mandated territories would, of course, be excluded along with colonial territories proper.
The following are the arguments against course (c) : (i) It is thought that the Egyptian Government might object to an Act ofParliament applying to Egypt only.(ii) It might be useful to have power to conscript British subjects in other foreign countries (e.g. South America) besides Egypt, which HisMajesty&apos;s Government may wish to conscript at a later stage in the war. (Conscription of British subjects in the United States is already covered by the arrangement&apos; that British subjects are called up for theAmerican forces unless they opt for His Majesty&apos;s forces.)9. In view of the objections summarised above to courses (a) and (c) weconsider that course (b) would, be more logical and more likely to be acceptable to Parliament. Although the National Service Acts passed during the present war, like those passed during the last war, only apply to British subjects resident in the United Kingdom, the Bill proposed now would not be making a completeinnovation by conscripting British subjects resident abroad. The MilitaryTraining Act of 1939 contained a provision empowering His Majesty by Order inCouncil to extend the military training obligations therein provided to Britishsubjects resident outside the United Kingdom, but in fact no use was made ofthis power as the Act was superseded at the outbreak of war.10. We understand that the Colonial Secretary has no objection to theconscription of British subjects of Maltese and Cypriot origin in Egypt along with other British subjects. British subjects of Colonial origin are conscriptedin the United Kingdom if they have been resident here for a certain period. Weconsider that it is better not to include British-protected persons, unless the bill were to take the form (a). --.11. Suitable provision will have to be made for the exclusion or exemption of British subjects of Dominion origin, and we presume that Indians will haveto be treated on the same footing as Dominion British subjects.Conclusions.12.&apos;  We recommend therefore (1) That a Bill be prepared and introduced into Parliament as soon aspossible, with a view to its becoming law before the end of the current session, to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to extend by Order inCouncil the United Kingdom National Service Acts to Britishsubjects resident in foreign countries, the actual procedure for callingmen up being modified by the Orders in Council as may be required,but the individual retaining the personal rights in respect ofconscientious objection and hardship conceded to him by the NationalService Acts.(2) That as soon as possible after the Bill has become law the necessary order in Council be made in respect of Egypt.(3) That a Defence Regulation be made imposing upon British subjects inEgypt an obligation to perform civil defence duties as directed by thecompetent British authority.A.
