A. FREE FRENCH.(i) Navy.Morale and Efficiency.THERE has been no further apparent effect on the Free French naval forces by the supersession of Admiral Muselier and retirement of his Chief ofStaff and three other officers, although, probably, many officers and men deeplyregret that matters should have come to such a pass. Photographs of admiral Muselier are still prominently displayed in most ships.2. Since Admiral Auboyneau assumed command he has carried out visitsof inspection to bases and ships at Dundee, the Clyde, Portsmouth, Cowes andWeymouth. The standard of smartness and cleanliness expected by him appearsto be high.3. The Free French corvettes employed on Convoy Escort duties are, on thewhole, well reported on.4. The maintenance of guns and short-range weapons is improving but is not yet all that can be desired.5. The discipline and fighting efficiency of the French-manned chasseursat Cowes remain good with the exception of one boat. Their participation inthe protection of convoys from air attack has given them some work for whichthey are well suited, but opportunity for more offensive action would benefit them.6. The general behaviour of French liberty-men ashore has been good.An unpleasant incident, however, occurred at G-reenock, when a fight devolped in the main street between Frenchmen and the civilian population. The origin of the disturbance is obscure, but it was noted that British Naval ratings whowere present sided with the French against the undesirable civilian elementsinvolved. A large patrol has now been organised and there has been no furthertrouble.Recruiting.7. The total of the E.N.F.L. personnel has now passed the 6,000 mark,an increase of 500 since March.8. It is expected that about 30 French Naval officers and 470 ratings,captured during the operations at Madagascar, will arrive shortly in the UnitedKingdom as prisoners of war. They will be given every inducement to join the Free French Forces.Successes.9. One of the Free French Chasseurs based at Cowes has been creditedwith the destruction of a German aircraft.Losses and Casualties.10 The armed trawler Vikings was torpedoed and sunk off the coast of Syria on the 18th April.  About 40-men were lost.11. The corvette Mimosa was torpedoed on the 9th June while on convoy escourt duty in the North Atlantic. She sank very rapidly and only one officer and 3 men were saved.12. M.L. 182 was attacked by enemy aircraft in the Channel. HerCommanding Officer and one rating were killed and practically all members ofthe crew were wounded.  She managed to return to harbour.13. - These, on top of the losses sustained last quarter, are heavy for such asmall Navy, but the French take them in the right spirit and are proud to have suffered in the fight against the Axis.Training.14. During the quarter about 70 recruits were sent to H.M.S. RoyalA rthar at Skegness.[24099] B 2

A certain amount of ammunition has been delivered, but shortage ofammunition has often prevented range-firing.&apos;28. A request has been made to the War Office for one 25-pdr. gun forinstructional purposes.15. Thirty ratings from the Free French Marines were also sent toSkegness for preliminary training as Commando troops.16. French officers and ratings attended the regular courses in variousTraining Establishments.Ships Commissioned and Refitted.17. The Corvette Commandant d&apos;Estienne d&apos;Orves (ex-Lotus) was corn-missioned on the 22nd May and is now working up.18. Three more M.L.s have been commissioned and the Free French Flotillawill soon be at full strength.19. Two of the Vedettes Rapides, Nos. 8 and 12, which were paid off last winter, have been brought back into service with Free French crews andattached to H.M.S. Tormentor, with a view to operating under the orders ofC.C.O. The third V.T.B., No. 11, will join them shortly. It is hoped that these and other craft will be employed on operations of this nature as soon as possible.Officers and men are only too anxious to take an active share in the in-shorefighting on the French coast. It may be added that the French Admiral andmany officers and men resent the lack of confidence we show in- them by notmeeting their aspirations more enthusiastically.20. The destroyer Leopard has completed an extensive refit and re-arma-ment at Hull, which occupied nearly a year. She is on the point of proceeding to the Pacific, where she will join the Triomphant.21. The submarine Junon has been under repair for the last three months,and the submarine Minerve has suffered from a considerable number of defects.22. The sloop Commandant Duboc has completed her refit and is awaitingorders to sail for the Eastern Mediterranean. The sloop Savorgnan de Brazzuis refitting on the Tyne, and the Auxiliary vessel President Houduce is refittingat Liverpool.Camp at Emsivorth.23 The construction of this camp, wfiich will take the place of the Depotships at Portsmouth, is nearing completion. It has been built to accommodateabout 400 men.Frenchmen in the Royal Navy.24. Transfers to the F.N.F.L. continue at the rate of about ten a month,and there now remain about 320 in the Service.
Employment.29. During the past quarter very few reinforcements have been sent overseas. With the prospect of operations in France, the Free French arepurposely restricting all drafts until further notice.30. The preparation of defence works for the locality to be held by the free french in the event of active operations has occupied much time, and satisfactory progress has been made.31. Useful exercises have been held, sometimes in conjunction with Britishtroops. A large-scale S.E. Command exercise held at the end of June 1942 was satisfactory from the French poiiit of view. Several instructional courses with british Schools and Training Units have been arranged, including attachmentsto British field units.32. A -further detachment of 20 selected men left recently to join aCommando Training Centre, and vigorous training is being carried out by specialunits under young officers who have been on Commando Courses, the idea being to select the best men for Commando work and also to extend the latest battlemethods to all combatant units.33. Two parties, each of 20 all ranks, spent three days at an A.F.V. Rangepractising firing 2-pdr. and Besa guns from British Cruiser Tanks.34. A gunnery class is being formed, and instruction in the 25-pdr. gun willbe given by officers trained at British gunnery schools as soon as the gun isdelivered.35. General de Gaulle inspected troops under training early in June and appeared very satisfied with all he saw.36. The Major-General in charge Administration, S.E. Command, inspectedthe quarters on the 16th May, 1942.37. The Cadet School has moved from Malvern College to new quarters inEibbesford Hall, Bewdley. Worcs.Security.38.   Satisfactory.Welfare.39. An English teacher has been attached to the Camp under the auspices of the Army Education Corps..Morale.40.   Good.(iii) Air Force.Recruiting.41. 9 Officers and 28 other ranks were incorporated into the Free French air Force, in the United Kingdom, during this period.Morale.42. Morale of air crews in the United Kingdom has been high that of ground tradesmen satisfactory.Training.  (See also Appendix VIII.)43.   During the period under review 26 Free Frenchmen entered Initial Training Wing.1 Free Frenchman entered Elementary Air Observer School.6 Free Frenchmen entered Air Gunnery School, to complete training as W.Op./A.Gs.10 Free Frenchmen qualified as Service pilots.23 Free Frenchmen entered Schools of Technical Training.General.44. No. 340 (Free French) Fighter Squadron arrived at R.A.F. Station,West Hampnett, on the 8th April, 1942, and has since then regularly taken part insweeps over France.
G45. General Valin has visited Headquarters, Middle East Commandprimarily to discuss with the Royal Air Force Staff the re-equipment of theLorraine Squadion. He carried out tour of inspection in Syria, and thenproceeded to French Equatorial Africa, whence it is believed he will shortlyreturn to the United Kingdom.46. As a result of General Valin&apos;s conversations, it is understood that oneflight of the Lorraine Squadron will be equipped with Blenheim V&apos;s for Coastalduties, and of the balance some crews will be given O.T.U. training, and someemployed on Ferry duties to India. This arrangement is provisional only, until such time as the Squadron can be reformed with new aircraft. There is at present no intention of bringing this Squadron back to the United Kingdom.47. The Alsace Squadron has been re-equipped with Hurricane I&apos;s and,has been doing good work on Coastal and convoy duties. It is hoped to re-equipthe Squadron with Hurricane IIs in the near future.48. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, was unwilling to release Free French pilots, now in his Command, in order that theycould form a Unit on the Russian front (see paragraph 35 of the TwentiethReport), and it is believed that the Free French Air Force authorities will not press for this proposal to be carried out in its entirety.49. It has been agreed to release 6 An sons for use of the Free French AirForce on Coastal patrol work off West Africa, These aircraft will be based onPointe Noire, and it is expected that they will be ready for despatch during august 1942.B. POLISH.(i) Navy.Morale and Efficiency.50.   The general state of morale and efficiency is excellent.51. Repeated convoy escort duties in the North Atlantic seem particularlytedious to the Polish temperament, but nevertheless the Destroyers at all timesperform their duties very efficiently.52. The Garland, which completed a refit at the beginning of May, hasshown a particularly high standard of efficiency in gunnery.Losses, Damage and Casualties.53. The Submarine Jastrzab was lost in Northern Waters on the 2nd May.The casualties were 5 killed and 6 wounded.   An enquiry is pending.54. The destroyer Garland, while escorting a Northbound convoy toRussia, was heavily attacked from the air on the 27th May and lost 25 killed and 43 wounded. She sustained some damage, but was able to proceed to murmansk.   She is due back in the United Kingdom shortly.55. The Destroyer Kujawiak struck a mine and sank off Malta on the15th June. Casualties were 7 killed and 14 wounded. Most of the survivorshave already reached this country.56. The Destroyer Blyskawica, which was under repair at Cowes, sustaineddamage by enemy air attack, and her completion at Portsmouth will now be delayed until the end of July.57.   The above casualties are heavy for the small Polish Navy.Successes.58. M.G.B. S 2, operating in the Channel, recently engaged six enemyE-boats single-handed and foiled them to withdraw.,59. The Admiralty conveyed their congratulations to the commanding officer of the destroyer Blyskawica on the promptitude with which her A.A. gunsgot into action in a raid on Cowes, and thanked him for the efficient rescue work done by his crew in the shipyard. The people of Cowes also expressed theirunqualified admiration of the Blyskawica&apos;s crew.

The Submarine Sokol, after serving for nearly a year in theMediterranean, is clue back m this country very shortly for refit and recuperationof the crew. While m the Mediterranean she formed part of a Flotilla whichsuffered very heavy losses.61. The &quot; Hunt &quot; Class Destroyer Slasjak (ex-Bedale) commissioned on the30th April, and after working up has now joined her Flotilla.62. The destroyer Burza will be recommissioned on the completion of herrefit in July.   ..63. The Admiralty have been asked to allocate a &quot; TJ &quot; Class submarine totake the place of the IT ilk, which is paid off.   This is under consideration.Recruiting.64. Recruits from Russia, numbering about 4,000, have now reachedDurban. I hey will come to this country as opportunities for passage occur andit is intended to absorb about 1,000 of them in the Polish Navy

A number of exercises have been held in the last three months. On17th May 1st Polish Rifle Brigade provided the &quot;enemy&quot; for an Expedi-tionary Force Exercise. On 14th May the Reconnaissance Group and a batteryof the 10th Field Artillery Regiment carried out a counter-attack exercise onMacMerry Aerodrome.73. On 31st May a very successful and useful Tactical Exercise withouttroops was held at the Headquarters of. the Training Brigade, attended by manysenior British officers, including the Area Commander, South Highland Area,Sub-Area Commanders and the Home Guard Zone Commander.74. On 3rd and 4th June a force consisting of Artillery, Infantry and reconnaissance units drawn from the 10th Armoured Brigade and SupportGroup took part in an exercise against our 44th Brigade from the 15th Division.75. On 10th June the Polish Engineer Company held an exercise &quot; Attackon Pillbox &apos;&apos; in the presence of the Chief Engineer, Scottish Command. Thetroops moved into position under cover of a smoke screen, and under coveringfire from machine guns, a miniature Bangalore torpedo was placed under theconcertina wire. A gap was made and the pillbox rushed under cover of smoke,grenades being thrown in through loopholes to destroy the pillbox.76. On 11th June the 10th Reconnaissance Group held an exercise inco-operation with fighters to practise dispersing their Carriers and repellinglow-level air attacks with L.M.Gs.Demonstrations.q !?&apos; 0lA l^ap&quot;1 Air Marshal Barret, who had inspected No. 309 (Polish)bquaaron, R.A.F., the previous day, saw a well-staged attack by the PolishParachute Brigade. Parachutists were dropped from Whitley Bombers on the rear of a system of beach defences which were holding up an imaginary seaIwSF&quot; wmd of about 30-40 m-p-h- was blowing at the time and the factthat there were no casualties among the men dropped testifies to the excellenceof their preliminary training.
78. On 4th May a company of the 1st Polish Rifle Brigade, with air support by the Polish Army Co-operation Squadron, gave a demonstration ofriver crossing by assault boats on the Tay, at Waulkmill, in the presence of theG-O.C.-in-C, Scottish Command, and the Polish Corps Commander. Coveredhy an Artillery barrage and M.G. fire, as well as support by dive-bombing, the demonstration gave a very realistic impression, the very efficient handling of thecraft and the speed of the operation being most noticeable.Artillery Practice.79.   The Polish Field and Medium Artillery Units have carried out fieldfiring practices.Courses.80. A number of officers and other ranks have attended courses of instruc-tion at the Polish Training Centres, and a large number have also attendedcourses at our Schools.81. At present the Poles are running a Senior Staff Officers&apos; course inScotland which is being attended by Czechoslovak and Yugoslav officers.82. Arrangements are in hand to move the Polish Staff College, at presentfunctioning in London, to a more convenient locality near Edinburgh.Special Training.83. The Poles have just completed their first course at their special TrainingCamp at Dunkeld, including assault boat training, swimming and rock climbing.84. An exercise was held recently to practise night marching, map reading and ability to re-group after carrying out individual sabotage tasks.309^ (P) Squadron. R .A .F.85. Two Fairey Battles have been received by 309th Squadron, who areto co-operate with our 52nd Division in dive-bombing. These aircraft are also available to work with the Polish Corps.86.   Two Mustang aircraft have also been received.87. The Squadron carried out an exercise with a British Brigade from4th-10th June, and co-operated with 4th British Divisional Artillery during athree-day shoot from 14th- 17th June.Teaching of English.88 225 Poles have now undergone instruction as teachers of English.English courses have been held in Edinburgh for Polish Regimental Commanders,2nds-in-Command and Adjutants.89. Eight different libraries, each of&quot; approximately 50 selected volumes,mostly English, have been distributed for the use of the Polish Forces.90. For the benefit of recent arrivals from abroad, short lessons in simpleEnglish are published periodically, and two trained Polish instructors in english are in permanent attendance for the benefit of new reinforcements.Arrivals.91. In May 7 officers and 153 other ranks joined the Contingent from canada. During May and June 40 officers and 1,248 other ranks ex Russiaarrived in Scotland. Further reinforcements, making a total of 5,500 ex Russia,are expected shortly.Drafts.92. Major-General Paszkiewicz, late Commander 1st Polish Rifle^rigade, and Major-General Kossakowski. late Deputy Corps Commander,,together with 276 officers, left for the Middle East on the 16th June.[24099] c
M edical.93. Arrangements have been made whereby the Polish 10th Brigade and polish 16th Tank Brigade will have the use of ambulance cars belonging to theEdinburgh Area Red Cross Motor Ambulance Convoy. This will enable theambulance cars of Polish Medical units to be conserved for use in active operations and field exercises.94. Dental Centres have been established at Duns, Gosford House Camp,Galashiels and Falkirk.Security.95.   Satisfactory.Welfare.98.   Satisfactory.97. Two F.A.N.Y. Canteens have been provided for the Polish troops,one at Kincardine and one at burnt island.Morale.98.   Good.Visits.99. A number of senior British Officers have visited the Poles in the last three months.100. In May the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, spent two daysvisiting units and establishments of the Polish Forces. He was accompaniedby Duncan Sandys, Esq., M.P. (Finance Member, War Office), the G.O.C.-in-C,Scottish Command, and the Inspector of Allied Contingents.101. The Commander, Royal Armoured Corps, spent two days in Junewith the Poles directing a elotih model exercise on the tactical handling of an armoured Division.Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.102. The formation of the Polish Division in their new locations south ofthe Forth goes steadily on, and the training of the very large numbers requiredfor the specialist purposes has been organised with imagination and skill.The Poles, who always help themselves, have established excellent schools oftheir own, in addition to making the fullest use of our schools, who are, asalways, so willing to help our Allies. They will, in my opinion, from now onwards absorb as many tanks as we are likely to be able to give them. ThisArmoured Division is being formed on the old model, as it is the policy oftheir Government to put together as many armoured units as possible with aview to the future.103. The Polish Parachutist Brigade is being stepped up in men andtraining, but not so far in material to the extent which it deserves. ThisBrigade has been approved in principle, and is made up of tough fightingsoldiers, potentially valuable to our war effort, and only requires to be equipped and trained on the lines of our air-borne troops. They have their own jumpingtower.(iii) Air Force.Order of Battle.   (See also Appendix III.)104. There has been no change in the number or equipment of PolishSquadrons, all of wfiich were fully operational throughout the period underreview.
Operations.   (See also Appendix V.)Bomber Command.105. The main bomber operations in which the Polish Bomber Squadronstook part were : Essen (7 occasions), Lubeck, Rostock (4 occasions), Cologne(3 occasions), Emden (2 occasions). Stuttgart (3 occasions), Hamburg (3 occasions),Dortmund (2 occasions), Mannheim and Bremen.106. The results obtained are believed to be comparable with those of theBritish Squadrons in the same group.107. All Polish Bomber Squadrons have, moreover, carried out sea-miningoperations successfully, and have been moderately successful in obtaining nightphotographs.108. The operational effectiveness of all the squadrons fluctuatesconsiderably at times, without any apparent reason, and it has been foundnecessary to remedy matters by intensifying squadron training from time totime.109. No. 304 Bomber Squadron was -temporarily attached to coastal command from the 13th May, 1942, and remains so attached.Fighter Command.110. A note will be found of operational sorties in Appendix V and ofsuccesses in Appendix VI.Coastal Command.111. No. 304 Squadron commenced operations in Coastal Command, on the18th May. after a brief period of training, and has been employed on anti-submarine sweeps.112. The crews were handicapped by inexperience of Coastal Commandprocedure and the language - difficulty. Communications therefore proved a bigproblem, particularly V/S communication with shipping.113. The primary task of hunting U-boats was well carried out, and thefaults here were, if anything, due to over-zealousness. Four attacks on suspected,U-boat wakes were carried out, and, if subsequent investigation showed thatsome of them were not justified, they did prove that a keen watch was being keptby the crews, and the main principles of attack were being grasped.Army Co-operation Command.114. A number of pilots of No. 309 A.C. Squadron had their first experienceof operational flying when they carried out three sorties in Mustang aircraft overFrance on three separate occasions during May. They attacked troops working onbeach defences, locomotives, a machine-gun post and a railway station. the pilots were, at the time, attached to a Royal Air Force A.C. Squadron, to gainexperience in Fighter reconnaissance work.Training.   (See also Appendix VIII.)115.   During the period under review:  54 Poles entered Initial Training Wing.23 Poles entered Elementary Air Observer School.44 Poles entered Signals School.69 Poles Afr^nnera j entered Air Gunnery School.157 Poles qualified as Service Pilots.25 Poles qualified for Flying duties.39 Medium Bomber Crews completed operational training.146 Poles entered Schools of Technical Training.[24099] c 2
116. As it has been decided to re-equip one of the three Flights of No. 309Squadron with Mustang aircraft, about the end of August, a number of the pilots in the squadron have been given conversion courses on Mustang aircraft and two Mustang aircraft have also been allotted to the squadron for training purposes. &quot;117 During the quarter the Royal Canadian Air Force authorities have accepted into their I.T.W. a further nine Poles, recruited in North Americabringing the total accepted to date to 51. Of these 23 have already proceeded to R.A.F. transferred E.F.T.S., 6 to A.O.S. and 13 have been returned to thePolish Depot in Canada as unsuitable.Polish Air Force Mission in North America.Recruiting.118. The total number recruited in North America as at the 1st July, 1942and sent to this country for training is now 206. Thirty of these recruits have!however, been repatriated and discharged from the Polish Air Force for various reasons, whilst there are a further 16 of United States citizenship whose transfer to the American Forces is under consideration.119. In addition to the recruits sent to this country, approximately 50 have,up to the 1st July 1942, been recruited and retained in Canada, for aircrewtraining.120. Recruiting in North America, which has always been on a small scale,has fallen off to a marked extent.Polish Air Force ex Russia.121. Approximately 40 officers and 1.100 airmen arrived in UnitedKingdom early in June. It is expected that the majority of these will be foundsuitable for service with the Royal Air Force.122. Acceptance procedure is now in progress. It is expected that of these,about 35 per cent, will be suitable for aircrew training.123. A further contingent of 7 Officers and 132 airmen are expected toarrive in the United Kingdom mid-July.Transfer of Polish Land Army Personnel.124. General Sikorski has recently intimated that he is. prepared to release1,500 suitable volunteers from the Polish Army in the Middle East for transfer to the Polish Air Force for aircrew duties.125.   This proposal is under examination.M or ale.126. The reports received from the operational commands indicate that thehigh standard of morale is being maintained in the Polish Air Force Squadrons.Bomber Command stress, however, that morale is higher in some Squadrons thanin others, and that a lack of replacements from O.T.Us. has had an adverse effect.127. Coastal Command have described as most impressive the high standardof morale of No. 304 Squadron during the six weeks this Squadron has been on loan from Bomber Command.General.128. In agreement with the Polish authorities, it has been decided to posta small number of Polish technical officers for engineer duties to the Middle east command, and it is not improbable that such Officers will also be posted to india for similar duties.129. It has been decided that one of the 3 Lysander Flights of No. 309Army Co-operation Squadron is to be re-equipped with Mustang aircraftbetween the 19th August and 2nd September, 1942.
13176C-DUTCH.(i) Navy.Morale.130. The morale in.Netherlands ships in home waters has remained high.An adverse report comes from abroad in the case of a cruiser, twenty-five mendeserting at Durban. The matter is in the hands of the NetherlandsCommander-in-Chief.Ships Commissioned, Building and Refitting.131. The destroyer Tjerk Hiddes (ex Nonpareil) was commissioned in Mayand is now working up at Scapa Flow. Her sister-ship, the Van Galen, has arrived at Colombo, and the Tjerk Hiddes is also to proceed there shortly.132. Another M.T.B. and a Motor Minesweeper have been manned bv theDutch.133. The submarines 0. 21 and O. 2A have completed their refits and willsail shortly for Colombo.134. The destroyer Isaac Sweers has returned to this country from Colombofor a refit.135.

The Dutch Military Authorities have had under consideration there organisation of their Contingent more suited to their strength, which remainsmuch below the establishment approved in March 1941 (paragraphs 136 and 137).Their proposals are now under consideration in the War Office. At present&quot;The Princess Irene Brigade&quot; consists of Brigade Headquarters,Brigade Signal Section,Armoured-Car Squadron,Two Infantry Battalions (weak),Ancillary Services.139. On the 1st May Major-General Phaff was appointed Inspector-Generalof the Dutch Forces, in succession to the late Lieutenant-General Noothoven vanGoor.140.

From the 21st March to the 29th April, 1942, No. 311 Squadronoperated on fifteen nights, carrying out 100 sorties, from which three aircraftfailed to return to base. During this period Essen was attacked on sixoccasions, and other targets included Hamburg, Dortmund, Cologne, lubeck ,Paris. Le Havre and Dunkirk.180. In addition, 1429 Czechoslovak Operational Training Flight pro-vided six crews for the two big raids on Cologne and Essen, and there were no casualties.181. A report from Bomber Command states that &quot; all Duties have beencarried out with keenness and resolution and morale has remained high.&quot;Fighter Command.182. A note will be found of operational Sorties in Appendix V, and ofSuccesses in Appendix VI.Coastal Command.183. At the end of April No. 311 Squadron was attached on temporaryloan to Coastal Command. It operated first from Northern Ireland, has nowmoved to South Wales, where, according to a Coastal Command Report, it &apos;&apos; hassettled down happily at uhe new station, and is eager to resume Coastal CommandOperations.&quot;Recruiting.184.   During the period under review 8 Officers transferred from the Czech Army for aircrew training.46 other ranks transferred from the Czechoslovak Army.1 airman transferred from the Polish Air Force.5 Officers from the Czechoslovak Army were commissioned in theR.A.F.V.R. for Ground Defence duties.3 airmen were enlisted in Canada.*N.B. Twelve others enlisted between the 23rd February and the4)th March, 1942, were not included in the last report, as they did not arriveft the Czechoslovak Depot until the 19th April, 1942.Training.185.

A recent report states that morale is very good throughout.E. NORWEGIAN.(i) Navy.M or ale and Efficiency.188. The morale of the Norwegians remains excellent. The efficiency of&quot;he former merchant seamen and fishermen has improved, and the manning oftwo &quot; Hunt &quot; Class destroyers and some of the new Type of M.L. has thus become possible.189. The Norwegian minesweepers continue to operate with zeal and efficiency.190. It has been decided that all minesweeping at Dundee shall be carriedout by Norwegian vessels instead of by a mixed force. A Norwegian Officer willbe appointed as Port Minesweeping Officer.191. The five Norwegian-manned Corvettes have been employed on convoy escourt Duties, mostly in the Western Atlantic. They are rendering excellentservice.Ships Commissioned and Paid Off.. 192. The &apos;&apos;.Hunt&quot; Class destroyer Glaisdaie was commissioned on the1st June.   She is now working up at Scapa Flow.193. The Newport has been handed back to the Royal Navy, and herNorwegian crew will commission the new &apos;&apos; Hunt&apos;&apos; Class destroyer Eskdale inJuly.194. The Norwegians are in the process of paying off 5 M.T.B.&apos;s and4 M.L.&apos;s, and will commission 8 of the new &quot; D &quot; type M.T.B.&apos;s in their place.195. The first of these has already been manned and the programme willbe completed by August.196. The destroyer Draug has been paid off, as she is no longer requiredfor submarine escort duties, and is not much good for anything else.197. The submarine Uredd has joined the 9th Flotilla. Her Officers are particularly well reported on, and when her crew have gained more experience itis expected that she will prove a valuable unit.Training.198. Seven Norwegian Midshipmen, who had completed their Sub-Lieutenants Courses in Gunnery, Torpedo and Navigation, have now gone to sea in British ships to gain experience.Recruiting.199. The total number of Norwegian Naval personnel has increased by 670during the quarter. Of these, a small number had escaped recently from Norway.One of these recruits remarked, &quot; Last year 90 per cent, of the Norwegian people were with the Allies, but when I left last month 99-9 per cent, were with them.

His Majesty King Haakon has recently inspected the various units ofthe Contingent.Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.215. A drastic reorganisation of the Norwegian Forces has been commenced.Their Government has appointed an overriding Commander-in-Chief (GeneralHansteen) of their Navy and Army and Air Force, and under him a Commander--in-Chief of the Army (General Beichmann), who, after consultations with theWar Office, has submitted in detail a plan for altering the existing organisationof the contingent by putting the Infantry Battalion and Machine-Gun Companyinto three &quot; Independent Mountain Companies,&quot; equipped for mountain warfare,with horsed transport (cart and pack). This plan has been approved in principle and is now well under way, and should greatly improve both the efficiency and confidence of these troops for action in their own country.216. The Norwegians have grouped the officers and men who have been toRingway in a Parachute company.   They are keen, handy and useful.(iii) Air Force.Re-equipment.217.

A small staff from our Liaison Headquarters at Malvern set up an advanced Liaison Headquarters for these units at Kidwelly.231. On the 4th May the Field Battery moved from Hereford to the DrillHall, Llanelly.232. The first week in J une the Headquarters of the Belgian Forces and the units located in Malvern and South Wales were all moved to the LeamingtonArea, where they are accommodated in huts, requisitioned houses and buildings.221. Thirty-two Norwegians during the period entered Schools of technical training in the United Kingdom.Morale.222. Morale remains high throughout, and Nos. 331 and 332 NorwegianSquadrons, now in No. 11 Group, have acquitted themselves well in offensive operations.

Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.243. The Belgian Contingent has been moved into Warwickshire, takingthe billets formerly occupied by the Czechs. Their 1st Battalion, Battery and armoured Car Squadron are up to strength, well trained, commanded andofficered. Their young officers continue almost without exception to get very goodreports from our schools and courses, which they attend in large numbers. the morale of these mercurial troops is an ever-varying factor, and constantlymentioned in discussions amongst themselves, and by their Commander, himselfthe most temperamental of them all. They require more attention than any ofour Allies and receive more. They will forget all their troubles if the guns begin to shoot.244. The Belgians have grouped the officers and men who have been toRingway into a Parachute company attached to their 2nd Battalion. This is awell commanded and very keen and useful unit, and will go to the Inter-AlliedCommando if it is formed.(iii) Air Force.Operations.   (See also Appendices III and V.)245. No. 350 Belgian Squadron has been employed on Convoy patrol,Fighter Sweeps and Bomber escort duties.&apos; i &apos;&quot;&apos;Recruiting.246. Further trained Belgian Air Force personnel have escaped to thiscountry, 6 of whom have been commissioned and 5 enlisted in the Royal AirForce Volunteer Reserve. Further personnel have been made available by theBelgian Army for training as aircrew.247. 11 recruits from civilian life and the Belgian Army have beenenlisted for training as maintenance personnel.Training.248.   During the period under review^ 18 Belgians entered Initial Training Wing.3 Belgians qualified as Service pilots.Morale.249.   Morale has been high throughout.G. GREEK.(i) Navy.Morale and Efficiency.250. In all 650 Greek Naval personnel have now arrived in this country from Egypt and India. 130 recruits were enlisted here, mostly from the GreekMerchant Service. This has enabled the formation of four complete crews for&quot;Hunt&quot; Class Destroyers and leaves a surplus of about 100 towards a fifth-crew,251. . The Naval ratings who came from Egypt and India, all of whom had previously served in the Greek Navy, have shown themselves keen and quick to learn. Their morale is excellent. Their discipline, judged by our standards, isslack, but, while the men may appear to resent strict discipline, they appear tobe able to do what is required of them in an efficient manner.252. The recruits from the Merchant Service have unfortunately given acertain amount of trouble and on one occasion 57 of them refused duty. Theywere joined by 19 of the regular Naval personnel. An enquiry was held. 28 men will probably be court-martialled. The principal grievance appears to be thatsome of the men from the Merchant Service, who were Mates, considered thatthey should have been recruited as Officers or Petty Officers, and not as seamen.Assurance that they would, in due course, be given opportunity to qualify for
higher rank did not satisfy them. General resentment to Naval discipline, anda large reduction in pay, were probably contributing factors. Otherwise thesituation is again normal.Ships Commissioned and to be Commissioned.253. The first Destroyer to commission was the Pindos (ex-Bolebroke), on 3rd June. Representatives of the Greek Government, accompanied by the archbishop, went to Newcastle for the naming ceremony. P.N.L.O. was also present. A telegram conveying the good wishes of the First Lord was muchappreciated by the Greek Authorities.254. The Pindos has completed her trials and has proceeded to Scapa Flowfor working up.255. The second, destroyer, Adrias (ex-Border), is due to commission on20th July, and the third, Hatherleigh, which the Greeks will call Kanaris, on27th July.256. The fourth, Modbury, to be called Miaoulis, will not complete untilmid-October.257. The four crews mentioned above have undergone, or are still com-completing, courses of training in all special branches. The majority of this training has been done at the R.N. Barracks. Chatham, which has been their headquarters.The engineering ratings have been/ sent to sea for short periods in. British&apos;&apos; Hunt&apos;&apos; Class destroyers.258. The crews for the second and fourth destroyers will have time available, between the completion of their training and commissioning their ships, for a period of general disciplinary training in H.M.S. Royal Arthur, atSkegness.   The first of these crews is there at present.259. The Admiralty have agreed to allocate two more destroyers and fourcorvettes to the Greek Navy7. Two of these corvettes, already in the Mediter-ranean, are being taken over by the Greeks there. The first one, the Peony, hasalready been transferred and re-named Saktouris.(ii) Air Force.Operations.260. The Greek Fighter and G.R. Squadrons are being maintained asoperational units in Middle East Command, and are doing satisfactory work.Training.261. On 25th May there were 111 Greeks awaiting training, or under training, in Southern Rhodesia. Training there had been progressing satisfac-satisfactorily until, in June, 72 Greek pupils, owing to grievances amongst themselves,refused to participate. Group Captain Vilos, of the Air Staff in Cairo, has gone to Southern Rhodesia to settle matters, if possible, on the spot.Morale.262. Except as indicated in the paragraph above, morale is good, especiallyin the Operational Units.General.263. Discussions as to the enrolment of Greek Air Force personnel intothe Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve are proceeding at Royal Air Force Head-quarters, Middle East Command.H. YUGOSLAV.(i) Navy.264. The crew of the Yugoslav Submarine Nebojsa, now in the Mediter-ranean, are not at present serving afloat. If it is decided not to re-man Nebojsawith her own crew, the Yugoslavs will probably ask the Admiralty for a Corvette.
(ii) Air Force.general.265. The crisis over the Yugoslav High Command, referred to in paragraph208 of the Twentieth Eeport, has now reached a complete deadlock. The greaterpart of the Yugoslav Air Force are interned in Cairo, and the remainder areno longer being actively employed. It appears likely that the whole Air force will shortly be transferred to Southern Rhodesia, but with little possibility oftheir being employed there for some time.Operations.266. It is understood that no Yugoslav personnel are being employed on operations pending the dispute over the Yugoslav High Command..Recruiting.267. Arrangements have been made to provide visas for 40 Yugoslavs, nowin unoccupied France, whom it is intended to send to Southern Rhodesia fortraining.Great George Street, S.W.I.,July 20, 1942.[24099]E
Notes on the various Allied-Navies.General State of Morale and Efficiency.1. Morale and efficiency continue, to improve in the Allied Navies and,speaking generally, the standard, is high.  In many cases it is remarkably so.The Allied Admirals.2. With the approval of the Commander-in-Chief, a visit to Portsmouthwas arranged for the Allied Admirals in May with the object of giving them anopportunity of keeping in touch with weapon development. Excellent andVernon gave full co-operation. It is intended to repeat this visit at 6 months&apos;intervals.3. The usual monthly meeting of the Allied Admirals, when V.C.N.S.explains the general strategical situation, continues. These meetings are most useful and are much appreciated, by our Allies.4. Visits for the Allied Admirals and some of their Staff Officers toarmament works at Birmingham, to the Ford Works at Dagenham and to theRoyal Arsenal, Woolwich, were arranged.
