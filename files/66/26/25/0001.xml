DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECRET. , Copy No.    0(JW.P. (42) 295.july 14, 1942.4WAR CABINET.VIEWS OF GENERAL DE GAULLE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I THINK that my colleagues may like to see the annexed account of someremarks made by General de Gaulle at&quot; a small dinner party given in his honouron the 3rd July by the British Representative to the French National Committee.A. E.Foreign Office,July 14, 1942.THE General said that, though the parties and parliamentary system inFrance were probably neither better nor worse in 1939 than they had been m1914, there had been a very real decline in the quality of French statesmen, andthat the Poincares, the Briands, the Millerands and the Clemenceaus were on afar higher level than the Daladiers, the Blums and the Reynauds. He thoughtthat above all the politicians prior to this war Mandel would be called upon toplay an important part in the reconstruction of France, but that he was not aClemenceau, for he had not the same deep roots in the soil of France. TheGeneral added : &quot; In the last war we had the luck to have a Clemenceau; in this war you have the luck to have a Churchill-you do not know how lucky you areIn talking of the cleavage between Right and Left in France, the General saidthat there were two sorts of Right: the petite noblesse decampagne and themoneyed classes. The former class (&quot; et fen stris&apos;&apos;) was inspired with the.highest form of patriotism and was willing to make any sacrifice for the gloryof France or for the good government of the country; many of the clergy belonged to this group. The latter class, composed of the very rich, was much moreself-interested and was bitterly hostile to the emancipation of the working classes.He agreed that the Parisian aristocrats, the racing set, the Comtesses de Noailles,the Ninas de Polignac, the Princesses de Faucigny-Lucinge-those titled ladieswho are the mistresses of Abetz or Darlan or who give receptions to welcometheir much-loved conquerors were on the same level as the rich industrialists :rotten through riches.2, Talking of French opinion about Great Britain, the General said thatafter the collapse of France it was thought that England was also bound tocollapse, and in consequence there was almost a feeling of pity for her sorryplight. Then came the Battle of Britain, and France was swept with a wave ofunglophilie, and the affairs of Mers-el-Kebir and Dakar did little to change this.Then Russia came into the war, and then America, and these countries now hadan equal share of France&apos;s sympathy. However, he had no doubt that Englandwould remain France&apos;s favourite Ally, &quot;car les Americains deviendront Propfa-tigants et les Rttsses trop inquietants.&quot;11797   [24106]
3 In reply to a question, General de Gaulle said he thought that Laval had much in common with Tallevrand, and when it was suggested to him that therewere not more than 5 per cent. Royalists among the population of France, heaoreed but said that the Comte de Paris had lost a priceless opportunity m notcoming out boldly as the head of those Frenchmen who wished to continue thestruggle.4. Asked at what moment he had decided to carry on the fight in thiscountrv the General said that it was at a meeting between Paul Reynaud andthe Prime Minister at Tours on the 11th or 13th June. Reynaud had been accompanied by Baudouin, and from the remarks made by the latter, the general had smelt treachery in the air for the first time, and thereupon made his decision.Asked whether General Spears had had anything,to do with this decision, general de Gaulle replied with great emphasis : &quot; Absolutely nothing.&quot;5. Talkino- of the war in general, General de Gaulle said that he thoughtit would be a great mistake to make a new front in France this year, it was true that the French people were very impatient and that the help which theycould give to a landing force would be considerable, but an attempt to gain afoothold in France which failed would be fatal. The Germans would not hesitate to give up at once all their ambitions in Russia and hurry back about 100 divisions to protect their French conquests.6. Talking of Libya, the General said that the battle now raging wastremendously important, though not vital. A battle of tanks against, tanks wasnot unlike a cavalry battle; the side which was outgunned could break off theaction, but if one side had superiority in anti-tank artillery, that was a veryserious matter. Rommel was one of&quot; those German generals who believed inVarmee de qualite. a small perfectly trained force of elite which could outfightthe enemy in the initial stages of the battle and thus prepare the way for othertroops of average capacity.   Rommel was the classic example of this school.
