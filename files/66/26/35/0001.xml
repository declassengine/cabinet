COPY NO.  3r/(48)  505.July. 1942,WAR    CABINET.MLRRENDIR IN the field.Note by tho gocx^otnry of the War CabinetuThe annexed Minute by the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster is circulated by direction of the PrimeMinistery(Signed)    E.E. BRIDGESreat George Street, S.W.1,PRIME MINISTER.I recently had a conversation with the new Londonrepresentative of the Chinese Ministry of Information, whom had known in the Par HastoHe had visited Chungking since the fall of Singapore,and reported that,  to his great regret, our popularity inChina had considerably diminished. .   This he believed to beprincipally due to the fact that the Chinese are quiteincapable of understanding the official surrender &quot;by aGeneral of his Army, with, apparently, the approval, or without the express disapproval of his Commander-in-chief and his Government0     He did not pretend that the Chinesewere braver than the British - he was, in fact, prepared to admit the contrary - but he said that it was with them anarticle of universal acceptance that a General must eitherescape with such remnant of his forces as he can extricateor, failing that., must commit suicideo      He himself, being aneducated man, knew that different ideas prevailed in Europe,but he said that he could not persuade the Chinese that thiswas so, and that he found it almost equally difficult toexplain the Chinese view to Europeans, who always assumed that ho was comparing European courage unfavourably withthat of the Chinese0The effect of a series of surrenders - St. Valery,Hongkong, Singapore and Tobruk are certainly a formidablecatalogue - cannot but have a discouraging effect, not onlyon our other allies,  but also upon neutral nations, which maylead them to the unjust conclusion that there is a greatertendency to surrender on the part of the British at tho pros-ent time that has existed in previous wars.     This conclusionmay be strengthened by the lack of any condemnation of the surrender by public opinion in this country       It is, no-1-

doubt, right that in most cases the responsibility should be thrown on the politician, who can defend himself, and who,should his defence seem inadequate,  can be superseded withoutignominy, but it is surely not desirable to proceed on theassumption that the soldier must necessarily be guiltless.Any Officer who surrenders is liable to court-martial, butcircumstances usually render court-martial impracticableuntil the war is over,, when the universal Inclination is to let bygones be bygones, and not spoil the victory by-recriminations about the pasteIt might, perhaps, be worth while considering whether there is a danger lest frequent surrenders may set an examplewhich will be followed by junior Officers in command of smaller units0     If there were such a danger;  how could it be averted?     It is obvious that political leaders must not laythemselves open to the charge of seeking to unload responsible-ility on to the shoulders of the fighting men.-,     It might,however, be possible for somebody of high authorits&apos;-, such asthe Prime Minister or the Secretary of State for War, to makea statement in which he would rebut the charge - even if ithad not been made - that the Generals- were necessarily to blame, and, at the same time,&apos; say that while it is impossibleto hold an inquiry at the present time;, when those concerned are in the hands of the enemy, such an inquiry will, nodoubt, be necessary later, if only in order - to demonstrate innocence of those who might otherwise be thought to havebeen at fault.Alternatively, it might be possible to raise the matter,primarily at any rate, in the press, either by means of a leading article or a letter signed by somebody whose namewould command respect3Headlines to-day tell us of fierce fighting in the streets of Voronezh.     There was no street fighting reported at Singapore or Tobruk.D.C. &apos;15.7,4S0
