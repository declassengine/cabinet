DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECRET.W.P. W 280-July 2. 1942.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-CZECHOSLOVAK   RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 18th July, 1941, His Majesty&apos;s Government gave full recognition to the Czechoslovak Government and to Dr. Benes as President of the Czecho-slovak Republic. They have since been treated in practice in exactly the same way as other Allied Heads of States and Governments now in this country.2. In my letter to the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister conveying thisrecognition, I thought it necessary, however, to make three reservations to meetthe special circumstances in regard to Czechoslovakia. These reservationsconcerned : (i) future frontiers;(ii) the juridical continuity of the Czechoslovak Government;(iii) the authority of the Czechoslovak Government over Sudetan Germansnow in British territory, whose leaders were at the time negotiating with Dr. Benes on. the subject of their entry into the CzechoslovakNational Council.3. Dr. Benes feels that these reservations imply a difference in statusbetween our Czechoslovak Allies and, our other Allies, and he has pressed forsome further declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government which would reassurehis Government and the Czechoslovak people on this score. He has, in particular,asked for an expansion of the Prime Ministers statement on the 30th September,1940, when he said that the Munich Agreement had been destroyed, by the Germans.Dr. Benes has also pressed for the withdrawal of the reservations set out inparagraph 2 above.4. The Czechoslovak position differs from that of other Allies in thathistorically and constitutionally there has twice been a break in their Govern-mental institutions : after the Munich Agreement and again after the Germanentry into Prague in March 1939. In the case of the other Allies we have notbeen called upon to proceed to any formal act of recognition such as took placeon the 18th July, 1941, in the case of the Czechoslovak Government and we have therefore been able to avoid any formal expression of opinion regarding their future frontiers. The Sudetan problem is in a special category inasmuch as the cession of the Sudetan areas resulted from an international agreement to whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government were a party, and Sudetan German and other refugeeswere welcomed to this country and have been the subject of special legislation.5. In view of the hard trials through which the Czechoslovak people havebeen passing since the death of Hcydrich, I consider it desirable, mainly forpsychological reasons, to give Dr. Benes such satisfaction as is possible. I donot propose to depart from the attitude of refusing to recognise particularfrontiers in Central Europe; and I should hope that Dr. Benes will leave aside the question oL juridical continuity, which is a matter of historical fact, andls in any case a question for the Czechoslovak people themselves and not one11783   [24051]Copy
on which His Majesty&apos;s Government should be asked, unilaterally or inagreement with Dr. Benes, to express an opinion. I therefore propose to concentrate upon a declaration (a) expanding the Prime Ministers statements of the 30th September. 1940, in regard to the effect of tine Munich agreement and (b) disposing of the only practical question between us, i.e., the relation ofSudeten Germans in British territory to the Czechoslovak Government. Thedeclaration which I would propose to communicate to Dr. Benes is annexed.The passage regarding the effect of the Munich Agreement, although it may help Dr. Benes, does not, in fact, mean any change in the existing situation orinvolve His Majesty&apos;s Government in any new commitments.6. The procedure which I. would favour would be the early publication ofthe declaration. But the paragraph relating to the Sudeten Germans would notbe published at present, and it would be understood with Dr. Benes that he could arrange for adequate Sudeten representation in the Czechoslovak national council in his own time and that meanwhile there would be no change in thepresent position.7. A question, however, arises which is of considerable importance in regardto post-war arrangements in Europe. One of the principal difficulties about the entry of the Sudeten German Social Democratic representatives into the Czecho-slovak National Council is Dr. Benes&apos;s views on a transfer of population fromBohemia and Moravia into Germany. Dr. Benes considers 3^ million Sudeten Germans to be too large a minority for successful absorption in a CzechoslovakState of some 15 million inhabitants. His general idea is, therefore, to allowGermany to retain the Eger triangle, and two other districts which are of littlestrategic importance and are inhabited almost exclusively by 600,000-700,000Sudeten Germans. Apart from this, he considers it necessary to retain the oldfrontiers of Bohemia and even to ask for minor adjustments in favour of czechoslovakia to compensate for the concessions set out above. He would thenlike to expel 300,000-400,000 Sudeten Germans as war criminals and to arrangefor the transfer of an additional 1 million, thus reducing the Sudeten Germanminority to about 1 million.8. Hitler has himself carried out compulsory transfers of populations ona large scale, and there will undoubtedly be pressure from many countries, andin particular from Poland and Czechoslovakia, for the transfer of Germanminorities fi&apos;om their territory after the war. Although it will in many cases be difficult to distinguish between Germans and the local population, it has beenreliably estimated that the total number of Germans whom it might be necessaryto transfer back to Germany from Central and South-Eastern European countries would vary between 3 million and 6,800,000, according to the completeness withwhich it was considered necessary to effect such transfers. Apart from Hitler&apos;sown actions and large-scale transfers carried out by the Soviet Government with little regard for the populations involved, there is no recent historical precedent for the transfer of populations on so large a scale. There were successfulexchanges of populations between Greece and Bulgaria and between Greece and turkey after the last war, but the largest number affecting any one country wasone and a half million persons absorbed in Greece. Germany and Greece,however, are not comparable in regard to either size or population. I do notthink that it will be possible to effect any substantial exchange, as distinct fromtransfer, of populations between Germany and her neighbours, as the nationalminorities within Germany are in most cases relatively insignificant.9. A population transfer on this scale would be a formidable undertaking.It will probably be impossible to avoid some measures of this kind in post-warEurope, but, if they are not carried out in an orderly and peaceful manner itis only too likely that the Czech and Polish populations will forcibly expel theGerman minorities from their midst. The question is whether we should nowcommit ourselves to the principle of such transfers, and let both Dr. Benes andthe Sudeten German representatives know that this is our view. I should notbe in favour of discussing the application of the principle until a muchlater stage.10. To sum up, I would propose to negotiate with Dr. Benes on the basisof the annexed formula, the first part of which would alone be published. Thesecond part would be withheld from publication pending the outcome of the
ANNEX.Draft Communication to the Czechoslovak Government.IN a letter to the Czechoslovak Minister for Foreign Affairs dated18th July, 1941, His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that The King had decided to accredit an Envoy Extraordinary and minister Plenipotentiary to Dr. Benes, as President of the CzechoslovakEepublic. Mr. Eden went on to explain that this decision implied that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom now regarded the juridicalposition of the President and Government of the Czechoslovak Republic asidentical with that of the other Allied Heads of States and Governmentsestablished in this country.The Prime Minister had already stated, in a message broadcast to theCzechslovak people on 30th September, 1940, the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in regard to the arrangements reached at Munich in 1938.Mr. Churchill then said that the Munich Agreement had been destroyed by theGermans. This statement was formally communicated to Dr. Benes on11th November, 1940.The foregoing statement and formal act of recognition have guided thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to Czechoslovakia, but, in orderto avoid any possible misunderstanding, His Majesty&apos;s Government now desireto declare that, as Germany has deliberately destroyed the arrangementsconcerning Czechoslovakia reached in 1938, in which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom participated, His Majesty&apos;s Government regard themselves as free from any engagements in this respect. At the final settlementof the Czechoslovak frontiers to be reached at the end of the war, they will notbe influenced by any changes effected in and since 1938.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government also desire to assure the Czechoslovak Govern-ment that upon receipt of a notification from that Government that adequateSudeten representation has been arranged in the State Council, and that Sudetenrepresentatives have taken their seats in the Council, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill be prepared to withdraw the reservations regarding the relationship betweenthe Czechoslovak Government and certain categories of former Czechoslovaknationals now in British territory contained in Mr. Eden&apos;s second letter toM. Masaryk of the 18th July, 1941.negotiations for the entry of Sudeten German representatives into the national council. I also request the approval of my colleagues for the general principleof the transfer to Germany of German minorities in Central and South-eastern europe after the war m cases where this seems necessary and desirable and authority to let this decision be known in appropriate cases.Foreign Office, July 2, 1942.
