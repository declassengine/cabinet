FOOD POSITION IN RELATION10 WAR POTENTIAL.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of economic warfare,There appears; to be some misconception about the effecton the Russian food position of the German occupation of Russian -territory.The position before the recent German advance,1. There is no doubt that, at least in the towns, russians have suffered food privation, but except at Leningrad actualstarvation has not been reported,2,     In June 1942, before the German break-through to the don, Russia still controlled 75$ of the pre-war grain area ofthe U. S.S.R.     The population which had to he fed from this area was also equivalent to about 75$ of Russia&apos;s pre-warpopulation.3.     The introduction of differential rationing assured asufficient ra.tion to those contributing most to the Russian war effort, and even if the shortage of skilled labour, draughtpower and agricultural machinery were to reduce the 194-2 harvestto 60 to 7C?&apos;o of normal, the rations of these privileged workers would have been assured.The position a:- affected by the recent and possible furtherWit \&apos;b.;..,:J.r/,&quot;&apos;4.     If Russia loses, in addition to the Voronezh area, thesurplus grain areas of Azov-Black Sea and North Caucasus (i.e, thearea North of the Caucasus watershed and South of a line Rostovto Astrakahn) without the loss of the deficiency areas in the centre and North, the food position would become worse, since Russia-  would be left with about&apos;60$ of&quot;its pre-war grain area but with65$ to 70$ of its pre-war population.5.     Transport difficulties, which have already increased, andare likely to increase in the event of further Russian withdrawals,may cause acute privation locally to non-privileged categories,i.e. to those not directly concerned with the war effort - the agedand infirm, and to the rural population.     Russians have, however,in the past, endured severe privation locally, and, except onthe assumption made in paragraph 4 above, the position is unlikely to be worse than during the lean harvest year 1936/1937.6.     Owing to the Russian system.of collective farming and state controlled collection and stocking, hoarding by foodproducers, which generally occurs elsewhere in times of short supply is very largely precluded.S.MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC WARFARE.21st July, 1942.
