HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942. O yIgCRET.LPi (42) 286.july 8, 1942     TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND  KFYIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this documentCopy No. 1 5WAR CABINET.FUTURE OPERATIONS.Note by the Prime Minister.I circulate for the information of my colleagues three Minutes about future operations, dated 8th, 13th and 15th June, 1942.w. s. c.10, downing  Street, S.W. 1.
General Ismay, for Chiefs of Staff Committee. rj lr,,&apos;OPERATION &quot; IMPERATOR.&quot;(Most Secret.)Your C.O.S. (42) 157 (O) (Final).1. The plan &quot; Imperator,&quot; which I have seen only in outline, proposes toland on the Continent a division and armoured units to raid as effectively aspossible during two or three days, and then to re-embark as much as possible ofthe remnants of the force. This is to be our response to a &quot; cri de coeur &quot; fron-Russia in the event of things going very wrong there. Certainly, it would help Russia if we launched such an enterprise, no doubt with world publicity and came out a few days later with heavy losses. We should have thrown awaivaluable lives and material and made ourselves and our capacity for making Wiridiculous throughout the world. The Russians would not be grateful for this,worsening of the general position. The French patriots who would rise in our aid and their families would be subjected to pitiless Hun revenge, and this wouldspread far and wide as a warning against similar imprudences in case of larger-scale operations. Many of those who are now egging us on would be the first topoint all this out. It would be cited as another example of sentimental politicsdominating the calm determination and common sense of professional advisers.2. In order to achieve this result, we have to do the two most difficultoperations of war first, landing from the sea on a small front against a highlyprepared enemy, and, second, evacuating by sea two or three days later thresidue of the force landed. It may be mentioned that this force would certain!]encounter near the place proposed superior German armour and good Germaitroops, by whom it would be accompanied on its inland excursion. When we sein Libya that it is only evenly, if evenly, that we fight with German armour, wmust regard the stay on shore of the landed force as very hazardous and costlyThe arrangements for bringing off the wounded would alone open up a vista oQ. problems, unless they are to be left where they fall virtually unattended.3. However, all this is to be regarded as &quot;bait&quot; to draw the Germafighters into combat with British Air fighter superiority. The idea is presumablthat the German Fighter Air Force will feel bound to face extermination rathethan let British armoured units go as far as Lille or Amiens. Would they,wise to make this sacrifice ? Surely having regard to the great superiority whicthey possess in armour and ground troops compared to the force proposed, t
tier they let them get into France and the more closely and deeply they letk   become involved the better.   They could, therefore, afford to use their Airr ce with great restraint, avoiding action and thus frustrating what they willdivine was our main purpose.4 Of course if this were one of a dozen simultaneous operations of a,-mjlar kind, very different arguments would hold. Such large establishments^ieht be built up and disturbances caused in France as to confront the enemy^ith a major danger, and cause him to use his whole Air power or even to bring back squadrons from the East. But a single foray of this kind would not have that effect on the mind of the German G.H.Q. and even if it did, as we are only,(.ayjno- a few days, there would be no time for any movements to take place. Infact the result on the fourth day, when our remnants returned to Britain a laDunkirk, would be that everyone, friend and foe, would dilate on the difficultiesof landing on a hostile shore. A whole set of inhibitions would grow up on our side prejudicial to.effective action in 1943.5. I would ask the Chiefs of the Staff to consider the following twoprinciples :  (a) No substantial landing in France unless we are going to stay, and(b) No substantial landing in France unless the Germans are demoralised by another failure, against Russia.It follows from the above that we should not delay or impede the preparations for &quot;Sledgehammer &quot; for the sake of &quot; Imperator secondly, that we shouldnot attempt &apos;&apos; Sledgehammer &apos;&apos; unless the Germans are demoralised by ill-successagainst Russia; and thirdly, that we should recognise that if Russia is in direstraits it would not help her for us to come a nasty cropper on our own.6. It would seem wuse that all preparations should go forward for&apos; Sledgehammer &apos;&apos; on the largest scale possible at the dates mentioned, but thatthe launching of &apos;&apos; Sledgehammer &apos;&apos; should be dependent not on a Russian failurebut on Russian success and consequent proved German demoralisation in theWest.June 8, 1942.W.

General Ismay, for C.O.S. Committee. tj -qq^The following note on &quot; Jupiter &quot; should be read by the Planning Commutein conjunction with my previous paper on the subject.   The Planners should setthemselves to making a positive plan and overcoming the many difficulties andnot concern themselves with judging whether the Operation is desirable or notwhich must be decided by higher authority.General Macfarlane should be consulted by the Planners, and it is possibbRussian troops might be used to come in behind a British high-class landing forceI must have a preliminary report by next Tuesday.W. S. C.13.6.42.OPERATION &quot;JUPITER/&apos;1.   There   are   two   important   differences   between   &quot; Imperator&quot; and I&quot; Jupiter.&quot;   First, in &quot; Jupiter &quot; we can certainly bring superior forces to bear Iat the point of attack and in the whole region invaded: secondly, if successfulwe get a permanent footing on the Continent of constant value to the pass;.of our convoys and oapable of almost indefinite exploitation southwards.  In Ifact we could begin to roll the map of Hitler&apos;s Europe down from the top. Oncelwe have established ourselves with growing Air power in the two main airfields,!we can attack by parachute and other means under Air cover the airfields to the!southward and make ourselves masters of this northern region, so that with the!Spring of 1943 other landings could be made, Tromso and Narvik taken, then!Bodo and Mo, by combinations of sea-borne landings under shore-based Air. NoBgreat mass of the enemy could be brought to bear upon them, except by inordinate!efforts over bad communications.   The population would rise to aid us as weBadvanced, and only as we advanced.   All this would be a convenient prelude andflaccompaniment to &quot; Round-up.&quot;   The distraction caused to the enemy&apos;s niove-Hments would far exceed the employment of our own resources.   The reactionsflupon Sweden and Finland might be highly beneficial.   Here is the best way offlacting in the autumn of this year as an alternative to &quot; Sledge-hammer &quot; ifjudge that the Germans in France are not by then sufficiently demoralized foflus to take the plunge.2. It has come to be accepted by us as an axiom that it is impossible tijflland anywhere against opposition, including Air opposition, however limitedH
., ut superior Air strength.   This is a hard saying which limits all use ofr to the very small portions of the French coast which are under home-and fighter cover, it may be questioned whether it is indispensable if the objectivej5 0f sufficient value and there is no other way. The lessons of the Norwegiancampaign in the Spring of 1940 must not be overstressecl. We had practicallv,10 anti-aircraft artillery and we exposed many scores of vessels for a month tothe enemy&apos;s Air attack Avithout any compensating Air defence. There werescarcely a dozen anti-aircraft guns available to us on shore. We landed over20.000 men at Namsos and Andelsnes and brought them off again without undueJoss, and the reason we came off was as much the military strength of the enemyas his Air power. It is not intended to press this argument too far, but there isno doubt that even merchant ships which have very powerful Oerlikon and otherflak defence can. for a while and for an adequate need, carry out an operation without total destruction. The last Russian convoy was attacked continuouslyfor four or five days with a loss of 20 per cent. It is a question whether it is better to land without fighter cover at a point where the enemy are very weakin armour and troops, or with fighter cover at a point where the enemy are very strong in armour and ground troops.  It is a question of emphasis and proportion.3.   Lately Mid-East Command gave us detailed calculations of the numberof sorties likely to be expected against &quot; Vigorous.&apos;&quot;   The estimate may be rightor wrong, but it is anyhow the way to look at these problems.   They must be faced in detail instead of our bowing to a general taboo.   Let us take September orOctober and examine the number of sorties possible by the German Air ForceMurmansk and Petsamo against an expedition of, say, 40 ships with escortwhich was approaching the coast.   The armada would probably be sighted atdawn of D. minus one, and would have to make the final approach during thedark hours of that day, assaulting before dawn of Day 0.   The protection of thearmada during the daylight advance would be by four or five auxiliary aircraft carriers, and every ship would have six or seven&apos;Oerlikons or other flak on theirdecks. The protection at the moment of landing and of the ships when anchoredor beached would be by six or seven beach defence ships with their trainedfloating flak.   These would also take part in the protection during the approach,lmilarly, the flak of the transports would be used in their own defence onmval. With all this, it seems unlikely that more than one-fifth or one-sixth of health  transports and covering craft would be sunk.  A military attack is not ruledtit simply because a fifth of the soldiers may be shot on the way provided thethers get there and do the job. ,4 Naturally, during the approach, British and/or Russian air forces fromurraansk would heavily attack any enemy airfields within range, and thisHould further minimize the losses of the armada.
5. The business of landing and assaulting and of capturing the airfiiiand other key-points is a matter for Combined Operations, and need&apos; nof \touched upon here.6. It is intended at the moment that the transports carrying the tronshould also carry a large part of their stores, and should also serve as th&quot;habitations and bases of the troops in so far as these cannot be found ashore t!is essential that the expedition should be self-contained for three months, so tinthe Navy is liberated from all need of convoys. Let me have calculations as tthe strength of the forces required, say, 25,000 men of high quality; 0f th!number of ships required to carry them; of the most convenient size of the saidships; and of the quantity of stores which they would have to carry for the threemonths&apos; reserves. Also, whether it would be bettter to send them altogether inone armada, or wait till the first lot have made a landing and then send a secondwave.7. As soon as the airfields are in our hands, our fighter aircraft fromMurmansk must occupy them. This may have to begin even before our own flai[is in position. We have to fight our way into the air as well as on to the shoreBut special arrangements to bring portable flak to the airfields at the earliest moment would be necessary. Three batteries of mobile or portable Bofors wouldbe needed for each airfield, and these should be in position in the first two days the heavier flak should come in as soon as possible. As we should only have twoairfields to work from at the beginning, it is essential that these should bristlewith guns.8.   As soon as the airfields are established with flak and fighter protect the heavy bombers would be flown from Scotland and would operate from theeairfields against the enemy airfields to the south.W.

It may also be shown to[the Planning Committee.2. The preparations of &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and &quot; Round-Up&quot; should be[separated from Commandei--m-Chief, Home Forces.   He has enough to do inved.w. s. c.15.6.42.other directions.  Pray show me how this can be achieved.simultaneity andAt least six heavyenemy should befavours them, mavof the enemy willin progress at oneOPERATION &apos;&apos; ROUND-UP.&apos;&apos;1. For such an Operation, the qualities of magnitude,violence are required. The enemy cannot be ready everywhere,disembarkations must be attempted in the first wave. Thefurther mystified by at least half-a-dozen feints, which, if luckfe exploited. The limited and numerically inferior Air forceShusbe dispersed or fully occupied. While intense fighting is* two points, a virtual walk-over may be obtained at others.2. The second wave nourishes the landings effected, and presses where theloing is good. The fluidity of attack from the sea enables wide options to bejprcised in the second wave.3. It is hoped that &quot;Jupiter&quot; will be already in progress. Landings orfeints should be planned in Denmark, in Holland, in Belgium, at the Pas deialais, where the major Air battle will be fought, on the Cotentin Peninsula,It Brest, at St. Nazaire. at the mouth of the Gironde.4. The first objective is to get ashore in large numbers. At least tenArmoured Brigades should go in the first wave. These Brigades must accept veryligh risks in their task of pressing on deeply inland, rousing the populations,pranging the enemy&apos;s communications, and spreading the fighting over the widest possible areas.5. Behind the confusion and disorder which these incursions will create, the:ond wave will be launched. This should aim at making definite concentrationsarmour and motorized troops at strategic points carefully selected. If fourfive of these desirable points have been chosen beforehand, concentrations atfehaps three of them might be achieved, relations between them established,and the plan of battle could then take shape.
6. If forces are used on the above scale, the enemy should be so disturb ias to require at least a week to organize other than local counter-strokes   fin,-that week a superior fighter Air force must be installed upon captured airfield and the command of the Air. hitherto fought for over the Pas de Calais m vbecome general.   The R.A.F. must study, as an essential element for its succe^must successthe rapid occupation and exploitation of the captured airfields. In the firstinstance these can only be used as refuelling grounds, as the supreme object is to get into the Air at the earliest moment. Altogether abnormal wastage mustbe expected in this first phase. The landing and installation of the flak at th*utmost speed is a matter of high consequence, each airfield being a study of itsown.7. While these operations are taking place in the interior of the countryassaulted, the seizure of at least four important ports must be accomplished.For this purpose at least ten Brigades of infantry, partly pedal-cyclists, but allspecially trained, in house-to-house fighting, must be used. Here again the costin men and material must be rated very high.8. To ensure success the whole of the above operations, simultaneous orsuccessive, should be accomplished within a week of Zero, by which time not lessthan 400,000 men should be ashore and busy.9. The moment any port is gained and open, the Third wave of attackshould start. This willlse carried from our Western ports in large ships. Itshould, comprise not less than 300,000 infantry with their own artillery pluspart of that belonging to the earlier-landed formations. The first and secondwaves are essentially assaulting forces, and it is not till the third wave that theformations should be handled in terms of Divisions and Corps. If by Zero 14,700.000 men are ashore, if Air supremacy has been gained, if the enemy is inconsiderable confusion, and if we hold at least four workable ports, we shallhave got our claws well into the job.10. The phase of sudden violence irrespective of losses, being over, thefurther course of the campaign may follow the normal and conventional lines of organisation and supply. It then becomes a matter of reinforcement and concerted movement. Fronts will have developed, and orderly progress will bepossible. Unless we are prepared to commit the immense forces comprised mthe first three waves to a hostile shore with the certainty that many of our attackswill miscarry, and that if we fail the whole stake will be lost, we ought not toattempt such an extraordinary operation of war under modern conditions.11. The object of the above notes is to give an idea of the scale and spiritin which alone they can be undertaken with good prospects of success.w. s. c.15.6.42.
