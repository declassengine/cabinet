LOCK AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS  OF  BOMBER  COMMAND for fortnight ENDING 1200 HOURS SUNDAY, JUNE 21, 1942.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.Weather.CONDITIONS were unsatisfactory on the whole. Cloud persisted over germany, with a slight improvement in conditions after Thursday, 18th June.Over the North Sea and the Coastal region of North-West Germany much cloudstill remained up to the 21st June.Operations.Night The Ruhr ...Day-Bruges DocksLannion AerodromeNight-EssenEmdenOsnabruck ...Enemy AerodromesEmdenDay-Le Havre ...8/9 June    170 aircraft81016/1719/2019/2019/2020/2120121110616828618512Mininq.-725 mines were laid during the period under review. ^ Of these,470 were dropped during the first week, the previous highest number m any one week being 299.  Effort was concentrated almost entirely off the Frisian Islands.Operational Achievements.The Ruhr (Night 8th/9tih June).-The attack by 170 aircraft on 8th/9th June was largely frustrated by cloud and smoke. It is now almost certain that Essen and. the Krupps works are protected by smoke screen, wtncn,together with the normal industrial smoke and haze makes identification ot tnetarget exceptionally difficult.[24066J
Emden. The attack on the city and port on 6th/7th June was very successful.The submarine building and repair yard (Nordsee Werke) suffered heavily. A pair of photos (Nos. 1 and 2) showing this yard before and afterthe attack is attached. The annotations on No. 2 photo point to the followingimportant items of damage :  A large new shop at the north end of this yard was gutted (A).Two other large shops in the south-west corner were also gutted andwere still burning at 1800 hours the next day (B).Nearby, two other shops were completely destroyed and a thirdpartially (C).At the south side of the yard a long erecting shop and the administra-tive block were both partly burnt out (D), while one end of a pair of shopswas severely damaged by fire (E).-The Sehulte and Bruns yard, which specialises in building small sea craft,was practically wiped out (photo No. 3 attached); 12 sheds of the HeringsFischerie were destroyed; 5 railway shops were gutted and several tracks cratered(photo No. 4 attached), and, in addition, many warehouses, sheds and offices were destroyed.A 2,000-ton ship is reported to have been sunk in the harbour.The subsequent attack on 19th /20th June is believed to have added to thearea of damage.Essen (Night 16th/17th June). Cloudy conditions were forecast on the night of this raid, and in view of the difficulty of identifying targets in this area,except in the best weather, it was decided to make a trial of &quot; blind-bombing,&quot;i:e., bombing by the sole aid of the new navigational instrument.Crews were instructed to attack Bonn if they found the sky clearing east of the Rhine.In the event, 15 crews attacked Essen, and 47 Bonn, but later photographicevidence does not indicate any notable results.Osnabruck (Night 19th/20th June).-This town and railway junctionof great importance to Ruhr traffic was an alternative target to Emden on the night 19th/20th June. &apos; Twenty-eight crews found clear conditions overOsnabruck and attacked with marked accuracy and success. Extensive firesshown on their night photographs are confirmed by photographs taken next day.Approximately 9 acres of commercial property in the centre of the old townare almost completely destroyed by fire; at least seven separate and seriousincidents of blast and fire damage are apparent in the southern half of the town;a 4,000-lb. bomb has hit the centre of the marshalling yard, destroyed a goods-yard building, and severely damaged the Klockner rolling mills and somewarehouses.Information regarding Previous Raids.Bremen (Night 3rd/4th June). This attack, apart from causing consider-able destruction&apos; in the dock and residential areas, effected important damage to oil refineries. Four large refinery buildings, all over 100 yards in length, were completely destroyed, together with two storage tanks.Cologne. A key photograph showing the devastated (as opposed to merelydamaged) areas of the city is attached.According to Vichy Press sources, Abetz, Hitler&apos;s representative in Paris,has stated that no less than 250,000 persons have had to be evacuated fromCologne out of a total population of 760,000, and that a census of all living accommodation in Germany is being undertaken with a view to forcing familiesto squeeze in this number of refugees. He said also that deaths amounted to between 11,000 and 15,000, and that nearly all the premises of the great banks,business houses, insurance companies and several of the largest industrial plantshad been totally destroyed. He emphasised the fact that the R.A.F. bombs were so powerful that even reinforced concrete shelters 30 feet below ground level hadbeen pulverised and hundreds of people trapped in them.
Mining.Reports have been received of a further eight ships sunk or damaged bymines laid by bomber Command. It should be emphasised that these represent only a proportion of the results which it is believed have in fact been achieved.In addition, the Swedish press has announced that the Ferry services between Kalundborg and Aarhus across the Samso belt and between Copen-hagen and German ports have been suspended since the 10th June.Mining frequently interrupts these important services.   The ships are highly specialised and not quickly replaceable,routes have been sunk or damaged : Copenhagen-MalmoHelsinghorg-ElsinoreSassnitz-TrelleborgSassnitz-TrelleborgGjedser-WarnemundeIt is known that ferries on the followingSunkDamagedSunkSunkDamagedMay 1940.November 1940.July 1941.February 1942.May 1942.A. H. M. S.July 6, 1942.[24066]There is no reason to disbelieve these statements, with the exception of thatrelating to casualties, which it is believed should relate to killed and seriously injured. Our own estimate of killed is 4/5,000, but the latest reports indicatethat bodies are still being dug out.Damage sustained by Industrial Targets in Occupied France.The following is believed to be substantially true, but allowance should bemade for possible exaggeration for propaganda purposes : A private report, dated the 15th June, 1942, states that the disastrous scale of destruction by the R.A.F. in France is shown by the computations for the assessment of insurance claims and estimates of the cost of reconstruction listed in French technical publications or mentioned in official communications. a preliminary estimate of the damage on the Renault works amounts to400 million francs. The total damage to French dockyards between the 7th and21st May is given as 300 million francs. The R.A.F. attack on the docks atNantes, including the Chantiers de Bretagne,- on the 8th May resulted in20 million francs damage; this includes the &apos;&apos; ateliers des pompes d&apos;alimentationet de reparations de locomotives,&quot; the &quot;ateliers de tracage des croquis,&apos;&quot;the &quot; bureau des etudes,&quot; and the &quot; prise d&apos;eau dans la Loire,&quot; ; the resumptionof work before the beginning of July is unlikely. Other conspicuous destructionsinclude the Gnome-et-Rhone works at Gennevilliers and the Fonderie SauteeLorraine. The Dietrich works are entirely destroyed, the Ericsson makers of navigation apparatus were gutted by fire. At Goodrich, all &quot;depots and hallscontaining spares and reserves w-ere destroyed. The Amiot aeroplane works were entirely destroyed. Matford at Poissy was entirely destroyed. At the Wormssubmarine factory at Tray-sur-Seine, about half the works were destroyed,including three submarines under construction. Between 150 and 200 workmenwere killed.
