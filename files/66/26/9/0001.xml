30CUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S G0V3RNMEST)rE^I42) 27? , .ijgn JULY. 1942o        . COPY NO. ^^JL  -I WAR CABINET&apos;proposed PUBLICATION OP LORD LONDONDERRY1S MEMOIRS.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal,At their meeting on the 16th June the War cabinet invited me to read the manuscript of a volume of memoirs byLord Londonderry, and to advise whether in my view it wasexpedient that permission should be given for the publicationof this bool:^    (W.Ii. (42)75th Conclusions, Minute I)2. I have now had the opportunity of reading carefullythrough the v/holo of this naruscript.      Its general purpose is an apule -;ia pro vl ja . sua   by Lord Londonderry,  consistingpartly of a number &quot;of commendatory letters that he hasreceived from Ministers and civil servants, partly ofargumentative justification for the policy which he hassupported at various times, and partly of criticisms of hiscolleagues, especially those connected with the Foreign Officeand Lord Baldwin during his term of office as Lord president and Prime Minister.3, The various categories of possibly objectionable materialare indicated in the Appendix to this memorandume      Two main questions are raised as to the advisability of givingpermission for publication.     The first is as to whether, and how far, official or semi-official State documents, largely in the form of letters from Ministers dealing with government policy,  should be allowed to be published;    and the secondwhether it is desirable to   relax any rules for the purpose ofpermitting the publication of a book which aims at justifyingone- particular Minister largely at the expense of his colloa0n&apos;&quot;&apos;r&quot;a number of whom are still members of the National Government,,There are also severe criticisms of the Deputy Prime Ministerfor the action that he took as Leader of the Opposition,,-40        Lord Londonderry&apos;s membership of the Government terminatedin the autumn of 1935 and there is, therefore nothing of alater date than that which has a direct bearing upon the first point.     1 understand that the gene rally a e cop ted rule (h.^-^on the Official Secrets Acts and the Privy Counsellors Oath;is that those who have held office as Ministers or theirconfidential adivsers are not at liberty to disclose orpublish Secret or Confidential information unless this canbe done without detriment to the public interest and permissionis du!,y obtained.,     In the casu of Cabinet proceedings,documents, etc, tho permission of the Sovereign is required,Since the&apos;end of the last war (fixed for this purpose as Is.November, 1919, or July, 1923, as regards Peace Treatydocuments), the general practico has been to withhold permission to disclose or publish Secret or Confidential informationbased on or derived from Cabinet   or other Ministerial proceedings,memoranda, etc. relating to events subsequent to the last wareIt must, however, be assumed that such permission would not beunreasonably withheld, that is to say for some secondary orirrelevant reasoi-o

,.The passages.in Lord Londonderry&apos;s,book to whichexception cbuxd oe taken are, for tne most part,  quotationsfrom semi--off ieial communi cat ions between Ministers on official matters re?itin ; to the pre-1925 emu     These arenow so remote in their bearing upon present day policiesthat there can bo -lb valid argument that it is reasonable to withhold the permission for publication, provided, ofcourse, the necessary permissions are obtained either fromthe writers of the. letters or frcy-. their cvocutcrc.      Thiswould apply&apos;to all the decvunents quoted emanating from Ministers5o A slightly different; question arises as regardscorrespondenee from officials, especially those who arestill members of the Civil Servicee     Some of those mightbe embarrassing to the civil servants and disclose a liability to uphold one Minister as against another, buton the whole I think that they would bo adequately coveredby the necessity for setting permission from the writers to publish, as I feel certain that if there were anything ofthis nature in the letters  he writers would withhold thep ormiss? on.,other ^. arc ceri,a:r? references to Cabinet Meetings and cabinet decision.&apos;: wlr..o;i by a flight adjustment of the textcould be made harmless60 The major quest:&apos;: an for decision is therefore, whetherit would be reasonable to withhold permission for   publicatiorion the ground that the publication of inter-Ministerialbickerings is undesirable, especially when a number of theMinisters attacked are still members of the national government and whether the publication,   of the book would start large-scale political wranglings us  to responsibilities for the past at a tame when it is most desirable to preservenational unity and to concentrate wholly upon the war effort-.70 The likelihood of the- book having such an effect dependsvery largely upon the public reaction to its publication andthe likelihood of Ministers or others feeling it necessaryin the light of that reaction to enter upon any justification of their pre-19 e   conduct3 &apos;   To some extent this might also apply to those who were then in the Opposition but who arenow members of the Government080 If this was the only aspect of the question a decisions would, I think,, bo easy and publication should bo rofused0V/e must, however, remember that the refusal of publicationmay itself create a public reaction and that it does raise a point of important principle as regards freedom ofpolitical discussion in the country,,     It may be argued thatsuch a book as Lord Londonderry1s, though written to justifyhis participation in public affairs, doss havo some value in clarifying the public mind as regards important political issues which may hav-h a considerable bearing \upon post-war policy^    and, had the criticisms of his colleagues been omitted, I don&apos;t   -hinlc that there could have been any validobjection to its publication,,9P The real objection, therefore, comes down to the factthat if Lord Londonderry:s book is given a wide publicity,those who are attacked in it may find it necessary to defend themselves as regards their past behaviour in order to maintainthe present confidence of the   people.

Owing, however, to the circumstances of the timesit is out of the question that Ministers, busily andvitally enr;u:;-ed in thu prosecution of the war, shoulddevote time to research into the past in order to justifyactions or lines of policy which are now no longer relevant.Such Linistoro v.-ould thus be placed in a ailemma.     Theyraus-, either OAsrocur 1 the attacJcs and appear to have no answer to them or el;;e they must waste time which theycannot 3pc.re ..n working out an argumentation which mustbo published in reply to the attacks.10.       In fairness,  therefore, to those who are attacked and in consideration of the necessity Id maintain theconfidence of the people    in the present members of theGovernment I do not think that there should be any relaxation of the rules in the case of this book0     Ifpermission is refused to publish the letters and cabinet decisions mentioned ih the first part of the book itseems unlikely that it could be re-drafted, as LordLondonderry seeks the main rjustification for his policies and actions in those statements and decisions.(Intdo)      R.S.G.Gwydyr House,Whitehall, S0&apos;.Volo2nd July, l94-20

It seems desirable that if thebook is to be published, Lord Londonderry should be advised that, at least in certain cases, he should ascertain whetherthe writers of the letters (or their legal personal representa-tives) are willing that their letters should be published,(5) Eerogatory comments on politicians, and on theForeign Office^Those, though not in themselves.important; may, ifthe book is published-  tend to focus attention of the questionwhether publication involves a departure from the practicehitherto&apos;&quot; adopted regarding the disclosure of confidentialdocuments or informationo

I asked Lord Hail sham, and J0Ho Thomas,both of whom were members of theGeneral Purposes committee,  and bothconfessed they knew nothing about thematter,,    The incident shows thedifficulties with which the Air ministry had to c ontendo    I also think it was an indication of the Prime Minister1 s mindat that time.    He was unwilling tohave another disagreement with hiscolleagues in the Cabinet who, for partyreasons, were attacking me through theRoyal Air Force&quot;.Page 189.

Almost alone in theCabinet, I had fought for the mainten-ance of the Air Force when there werepowerful, forces banded together againstthe very idea of its survival,&quot;LORD L0&apos;s INTERVIEW WITH Mi.  ramsay macdonald AND MR. BALDWINB&quot;Ramsay was more vague and elusive than usual, and he looked drawn and anxious.After some desultory conversations- I mentioned my difficulties,    Baldwinintervened with the remark &quot;You shouldnot :bother about the newspapers:    Inever take any notice of them&quot;.&quot;&apos;&quot;That was disconcerting enough but after a little I said, - &quot;The positionis thisj, Prime Minister, have I your.....confidence or not?&quot;&quot;

Description of Documcnt.To my intense astonishment MacDonalddid not reply.    There was an awkwardsilence, broken by Baldv/in when hesaid abruptly -&quot;Of course you have.    The Prime minister has confidence in all his Ministers&quot;,,Then a second silence, not less awkward?followed; and a little later Baldwinasked if he was wanted any more - asotherwise he would take his leave.I was extremely angry.   When Baldwinhad gone I was about to explain with someheat what I thought of the PrimeMinister&apos;s attitude, when he interruptedme.    He produced a letter and asked meto read it.    It was from Lord Horderhis doctor...    I went away with a very heavy heart.    I realised with regret that, probably at the end of the long,and strenuous fight for the Air Force,I was not to be responsible for it any longer.    It was obvious that my days atthe Air Ministry were numbered.......11tsopneni on Pages 310     &quot;It was always his (Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s)aous page. to 311. contention afterwards that both agreedto retire from their respective offices,and that although they might still be members of the Government they would serve under the leadership of neville chamberlain.&quot;It came as a tremendous shock to him personally when Baldwin decided to becomePrime Minister for the third time,which he did on 7th June, 1955.    In factI will go so far as to say thatMacDonald would have endeavoured tocarry on, even in his deplorable stateof health, had he thought for onemoment that Baldwin would be his successor.    In any case Ramsay did notforgive S.B.  to his dying day.Lents.Page.
