THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT      !       /Printed for the War Cabinet.   Jidy 1942.Copy No.   26W.P. (42) 307.July 22, 1942.WAR CABINET.SECRETPROPOSAL TO GRANT TO INDIAN COMMISSIONED OFFICERSPOWERS OF PUNISHMENT OVER BRITISH SERVICE PERSONNEL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.IN 1932, in furtherance of the policy of Indianisation, a new class of&quot; Indian Commissioned Officer &quot; was created. These officers receive commissionsin His Majesty&apos;s Indian Land Forces while King&apos;s Commissioned Officers of theIndian Army, whether British or Indian, received commissions in His Majesty&apos;s land Forces.The extent to which powers of command over British Service personnelshould be granted to this new class of officer was discussed with the War Office,and the decision which was reached is embodied in paragraph 193 King&apos;s Regu-lations which ends with the sentence : &quot; The power of command (i.e., of IndianCommissioned Officers over British personnel) will be the power of commandvested in officers of corresponding rank and status holding commissions in theLand Forces, but will be exclusive of powers of punishment..&quot; The same wordingis used in Indian Army Order No. 799 of 1935.On the 26th April of this year I received a telegram in which the Govern-ment of India urgently requested the immediate removal of this disabilityregarding powers of punishment. They pointed out that a number of units inIndia and overseas contained both Indian and British Service personnel, thatcertain Indian Commissioned Officers had now reached a stage of seniority and efficiency which rendered them the most suitable officers available for the com-mand of such units or sub-units, and that the undesirable effects were obviousof placing in command of units officers who were unable to punish equally all those who served under them. The awkwardness of the position was emphasised in the^ case of battle casualties. A typical case was mentioned of an IndianCommissioned Officer in Signals who had already been passed over for commandon account of this deficiency in his powers, and who, though fully qualified byseniority and ability, could not for the same reason take over Divisional Signalsshould his seniors become battle casualties.I was in entire agreement with the Government of India&apos;s views as to thepolitical and administrative desirability of removing this discrimination, andduly requested the concurrence of the Army Council and the Air Council, thelatter being concerned with the similar discrimination in the relations of the personnel of the R.A.F. and Indian Air Force.The Army Council&apos;s reply, received on the 12th June, was, to my regret,unfavourable. Briefly, their views were that, while they were not permanentlyagainst such a change, the present time is inopportune since there is every indica-uon that Gandhi is about to launch an internal civil disobedience campaign and]t is, therefore, possible that on the one hand the loyalty of &quot;some Indian Com-missioned Officers might be sapped thereby, and on the other that the Britishsoldier might be less disposed to accept punishment from an Indian Officer and!rffi t-en t0 aPPeal and press for a court-martial, with the result that thedifficulties of the situation would be exacerbated.[24131]
I was not prepared to accept this view, but before referring the question tothe War Cabinet I thought it desirable to obtain a further expression of the viewsof the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief in India in the light of the objec-tions raised by the Army Council. This I have now received worded asfollows : &quot;... Actual number of Indians having attained or about to attain com-mand is very small. Most of them are King&apos;s Commissioned Officers and there-fore already possess powers of punishment over British personnel. Such powers are fully understood by those concerned and have no adverse effect on prestige of white man in the East. On the other hand, the continued withholding ofthese powers from a handful of Indian Commissioned Officers creates ananomaly irritating to the officers themselves and to Indian public opinion,and likely to produce political consequences out of all proportion to numberof individuals affected. . . . Disagreeing with War Office, Commander-in-Chief and I hold that this is just the right moment to make change,which will excite little notice for reasons given above. . . . Reference to ghandi not understood. Even if he brings off mass disobedience ordered,and loyalty of Indian Commissioned Officers is thereby affected, which seemswildly improbable, the retention of this grievance will not mend matters.&quot;Since the Secretary of State for War is still unable to agree, I find itnecessary to place the matter before the War Cabinet for decision.I understand that the Air Council are prepared to accept the proposals ofthe Government of India. So far as the Navy is concerned, the orders which theAdmiralty have issued regarding the powers of command of officers of the RoyalIndian Navy contain no restriction regarding powers of punishment.India Office, July 22, 1942L.
