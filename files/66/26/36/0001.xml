Operational Achievements.Emden.   (22nd/23rd June.)4. A force of 225 aircraft attacked Emden on the night of the 22nd/23rdJune to follow up the successful raid on the 6th/7th June. The bombers weresupported by Intruder aircraft operating over enemy aerodromes from whichnight fighters were likely to operate.Weather conditions and visibility were good, ground haze being slightFlare dropping aircraft which opened the attack were of considerable assistancePhotographs taken on the day after the attack show that, apart from newfire and blast damage in the town, considerable additional damage was done to the submarine building yard, to the commercial dock area, and to rolling stoc^in the goods sidings. An annotated photograph is attached showing the damage in the port area, together with an explanatory list of the principal points affectedA second photograph shows the areas of heavy damage blocked out in white.Bremen.   (25th/26th, 27th/28th, 29th/30th June, 2nd/3rd July.)5. The first of these raids was the third occasion in a month on which a force of over 1,000 bombers was directed against a single target. This forceconsisted of 1,077 aircraft, including 103 from Coastal Command. In addition,71 aircraft, including 27 from Coastal Command, carried out Intruder operations against night fighter aerodromes.Since then, a further three raids have been launched on Bremen, two ofwhich were &apos;&apos; blind-bombing &apos;&apos; efforts designed in part to test the deductionsof the Operational Research Section as to the probability of successful attackswith low casualties by this method, against an isolated target of adequate size.As a result of these raids, considerable damage has been caused particularlyin the eastern part of the city, where approximately 40 acres of heavily built-up area have been gutted, and in the old town.The Focke-Wulf aircraft factory, wmich is turning out the latest Germanfighter in large numbers, sustained heavy damage, one of its largest shjops being destroyed by a direct hit with a 4,000-lb. bomb, as shown in the attachedphotograph.Photographs have also revealed further damage to industrial concerns,amongst which are&apos; two large sheds near the Gropelinger marshalling yard,four factories and 10 railway workshops in the Neustadt district, 17/20 industrialsheds and workshops in the Hasteder district.A photograph of the damaged railway shops is attached, areas in whichthere is complete destruction being ringed.Delmenhorst.6. During the big attack on Bremen several crews bombed the alternativetarget of Delmenhorst and photographs have now revealed extensive and important destruction in this town chiefly to the linoleum, jute and woollenfactories. A photograph of the very severe damage to the jute factory is attached.Flensburg.7. This attack on the submarine building yards was carried out at a very low altitude in daylight, by Mosquitoes, which have hitherto only been employedon high altitude photographic missions. One hour after the attack anotherMosquito bombed and photographed the target from 25,000 feet. Although the photographs were not very clear, they showed that serious damage had been caused to the gas works adjacent to the yards. A gas holder had beenpierced, one of its biggest sheds (180 x 65 feet) and 2 smaller buildings guttedand its main building damaged by fire; another building (120 x 50 feet) was still burning when the photographs were taken.Aerodromes in Holland.8. A low level attack by 4 formations, each of 3 Boston aircraft, wascarried out on the morning of 4th July. A feature of the attack was the manningof 6 out of the 12 aircraft by American crews from-Units already stationed inthis country.The targets were the fighter aerodromes at De Kooy, Bergen AlkmaaT,^Valkenburg and Haamstede.   Fires were seen in Hangars and administrative
buildings, and aircraft on the ground were attacked with machine-gun fire. AtHaamstede a parade of about 160 Germans in flying kit. was attacked, with good effect.Information regarding Previous Raids.Cologne.9. A report has been received that, as a result of the &quot; thousand raid,&quot; thelocal authorities were completely unable to deal with the situation. Emergencyfeeding, first aid, and evacuation measures all broke down, and some people hadto walk over 30 miles to find lodging. S.A. and S..S. officials deserted the cityunder the pretext of seeking emergency accommodation in the surrounding countryfor the homeless people.The raid, as was the case at Lubeck and Rostock, was considered a revengefor Coventry, and there was a noticeable bitterness among the population thatthey should have had to suffer for the Nazi Party misdeeds. Evacuees were&quot; reminded forcibly&quot; that their sufferings were personal and not typical ofgeneral events, upon which subject they must keep quiet.Mannheim.10. It is reported that in the raid of the 19th/20th May a large factory onthe left bank of the Rhine was burnt out completely. Damage was also caused to the large and important I.G. Farben-Industrie Chemical works, and therailway between the main station and the harbour was hit in six places.Immediately East of the Bimien Hafen two large warehouses were hit and burnt out. The report states that there were six hundred killed and wounded.Stuttgart.11. It is reported that during the two raids in the first week of May theBosch Works were damaged. They provide 90 per cent, of German requirementsof ignition generators and plugs.Nantes.12. Two sources have reported that the Chantiers de Bretaghe shipyardwas seriously damaged during the raid on 6th/7th May. This was a raid by&quot;Freshmen.&quot; .Mining.13. Further reports of ships sunk or damaged by mines laid by bomber command are given below : (i) One of Germany&apos;s latest minesweepers of 1,200 tons, fitted with anti-magnetic mine gear, was mined and sank on 11th May off Trelleborg,about 2 miles outside territorial waters.(ii) The Swedish S.S. Ekno, of 1,847 tons, was mined and sank about 5 miles south of Heligoland.References in the Foreign Press to the effect of our minelaying operations are becoming more frequent.  On 19th June a Swedish paper states : &quot; Terboven has demanded that Norwegian shipowners should order their ships, sailing for the Allies, to come home. It is readily understood that theGermans would be glad to get these ships, as the Board of Shipping in Oslohas now only about twenty seaworthy ships left. During one week in Maysix ships, representing 40,000 tons, were sunk between Germany and norway.&quot;A reliable diplomatic source in Stockholm reports that it is popular talk inGerman ports that at least one vessel a day, and sometimes as many as four, arelost whilst sailing between the Elbe and Rotterdam.The Swedish press of 22nd June announced the names of sixteen minedvessels whose crews have protested against sailing to Rotterdam.The Berlin correspondent of a Swedish paper said on the 27th June, that theferry boats between Trelleborg and Sassnitz still could not leave port. All threewere in Sassnitz awaiting instructions.Another Swedish paper reported on the 25th June that the crew of theSwedish Eknaes, which was sunk in the North Sea, told on their return to Sweden[24135] b 2
