naval SITUATION.General Review.1. A convoy from Russia has cleared Northern Waters with the loss of fiveships sunk by mines.An outward-bound convoy to Russia has been heavily attacked by aircraft and U-boats. Although some ships have reached Russians waters, many areunaccounted for and losses are likely to be heavy.Shipping casualties elsewhere have been considerable.Home Waters.2. An E or R-boat was attacked and damaged by M.G.Bs. early on the 6thoff Cape Gris Nez.Northern Waters.3. A convoy of 35 ships left North Russian ports at the end of June forthe United Kingdom. The convoy was shadowed by aircraft for some days, but no serious attack occurred. On the 5th July, when in thick weather, a portionof the convoy ran into a British minefield north-west of Iceland (C).H.M. Minesweeper Niger and five ships, totalling 31,200 tons, were sunk, andone ship was damaged but reached harbour.An outward convoy for Russia of 35 ships also sailed at the end of June.One of the ships went ashore on the west coast of Iceland (C), and a second was damaged by ice and forced to return. This convoy was also located by the enemy and was shadowed by aircraft and U-boats. Attacks developed when the convoy was in the vicinity of Bear Island on 4th July; and, in the course of the day,three ships were sunk and one damaged.Cover for both the homeward and outward convoys and close support andescort for the outward convoy was provided to the westward of Bear Island bythe Home Fleet and U.S.A. ships in Home Waters. Air reconnaissance on the3rd showed that the Tirpitz and Hipper had left Trondheim. On the night ofthe 4th/5th, in view of the threat of attack by surface craft, the convoy, then150 miles north-east of Bear Island, was ordered to scatter. On the evening ofthe 5th, the Russian Submarine K. 21 sighted the Tirpitz and Hipper with eight destroyers steering to the north-east off the North Cape. The K. 21 attacked and claimed two hits with torpedoes on the second ship in the line, which she believed to be the Tirpitz, but was later reported by H.M. Submarine P. 54 to be theHipper.Attacks On the scattered ships of the convoy by torpedo-aircraft and U-boats were reported on the 5th and 6th. The R.F.A.&apos; Aldersdale, the Rescue ShipZaafaran and six more ships are believed to have been sunk.Full information has not yet been received, but the latest report states thatsix ships are known to have been sunk, seven have arrived in the White Sea, sevenothers are proceeding under escort and one ship has reached the north coast ofNova Zembla. This would leave 12 ships unaccounted for, in addition to some ofthe escorting vessels.Air reconnaissance on the 7th showed the Tirpitz, lutzow and Hipper, withseven destroyers and a tanker, under way in Alten Fiord (south-west of theNorth Cape)&apos;.Mediterranean.n n?&apos;M&apos; Submarine Thrasher sank a 2,500-ton ship in an escorted convoy inthe Gulf of Sidra on the 23rd June and a south-bound auxiliary vessel of3,000 tons north-east of Derna on the 29th.Enemy shipping losses in the Mediterranean during the period the 1st june to the 2nd July are estimated to total 20,637 tons sunk and 32,000 tons damaged.During the week some 16,300 tons of French merchant shipping west-boundand some 9,500 tons east-bound have passed through the Straits of Gibraltarunder escort.
Indian Ocean.5. Early on the 2nd Mayotta Island, in the Mozambique Channel, was captured by our forces. I he trench authorities were taken by surprise and therewere no casualties on either side. rPacific.6. United States submarines claim to have sunk four Japanese destroyers and to have torpedoed and set on fire a fifth off Kiska, Aleutian Islands durum-the period the lst-5th July. &apos; 0The consolidation of the enemy&apos;s position in the Western Aleutians continuesand it appears that Agattu Island has now been occupied.Antl-Submarine Operations.7. Thirteen attacks on UJooats were carried out by aircraft and seven by surface craft during the week. Of these attacks, nine were made off the east coast of North America, four in the West Indies, four in the Bay of Biscay andthree in Home Waters. Attacks by H.M. Ships Veteran and Le Tigre off thecoast of Newfoundland and by a Whitley aircraft south-west of Ushant werepromising; but in no case was there definite evidence of destruction Five ofthe attacks were carried out by U.S.A. forces.Enemy Intelligence.German.8. Movements of craft suitable for a combined operation continue towardsnorthern Norway.Italian.9. The Destroyer Strale (1932, 4-4-7-inch) is reported to have goneashore off Cape Bon and to have been abandoned as a total loss.Of the liners Augusta and Roma, wdiich were being converted into aircraft carriers at Genoa, work is continuing on the Roma alone. She may be ready fortrials by the late autumn. One &quot; Regolo &quot; class cruiser (3,362 tons, 8; 5-3-inch)is now complete and has arrived at Genoa from Leghorn.There is no evidence of any concentration of shipping in the ^aegean for aseaborne expedition.Japan.10. It is estimated that the present effective strength of the Japanese fleet,after making allowance for casualties, is approximately : 9-11 battleships,8 aircraft carriers, 12 seaplane carriers, 26 cruisers, 102 destroyers and 85 U-boats(excluding midget U-boats).V-boats.U. The number of U-boats operating in the Atlantic has increased to atotal of over 60. They are particularly active in the western Gulf of Mexico,the approaches to Colon and the coastal routes off Florida and in other Americanwaters in which unescorted shipping is to be found. In Northern Waters a totalof some ten U-boats attacked the convoy to Russia. There has been no activitym the South Atlantic.Three Japanese U-boats are believed to be on patrol in the MozambiqueChannel. U-boats have also been reported off New Caledonia, the New Hebrides,,n New Zealand waters and off the west coast of North America.In French Atlantic ports there are 93 protected U-boat berths, of which62 are complete.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. During the week ending midnight 5th/6th July, 1,108 ships, includingjW8 Allied and 23 neutral, have been convoyed. Of these, 180 ships were inwean Convoys, 910 in British coastal convoys and 18 in Western Atlantic convoys.
One armed merchant cruiser, five anti-aircraft ships, 77 destroyers (includ&apos;three Russian destroyers), three submarines and 110 sloops, cutters and eorvpt?&quot;(including two US.A. cutters) have been employed on escort duty. 8Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekend&apos;4th July totalled 459,000 tons, compared with 824,000 tons during the previewseven days and an average of 621,000 tons for the past ten weeks.  Of the week8imports, 103.000 tons were oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.13. In an attack on a Channel convoy by E-boats and aircraft betweenPortland and Start Point, six ships were sunk. Two ships were sunk and a thirdtorpedoed in a U-boat attack on a coastal convoy in the mouth of the St. LawrenceRiver. Reports have been received of U-boat attacks during the week on twelveother ships, eight of which are known to have sunk. Nine of these attacks tookplace in the West Indies and Gulf of Mexico and one in the Eastern Mediter-ranean.  One ship was shelled north-east of Durban.Losses incurred in the convoys to and from Russia are reported under&quot;Northern Waters.&quot;Shipping losses from enemy action during June 1942, as recorded to datetotalled 681,000 tons, which is the third highest monthly total to date. U-boatsaccounted for 594,000 tons, or 87 per cent, of the total. Twenty-four tankers(184,000 tons) were sunk, 22 in the Atlantic (not 32 as stated in lasjt week&apos;resume) and two in the Mediterranean.The bulk of the losses occurred in the Atlantic.The revised figures for May 1942 show that in that month U-boats accountedfor 608,000 tons, also 87 per cent, of the total.Details are given in Appendix I.British Minelaying.14. During the week.mines have been laid by surface craft in the East Coastbarrage. Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out on an extensive scale offthe Frisian Islands and also in the Kattegat and Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesi&amp;eeping.15. Enemy aircraft have laid mines on three nights of the week off milford haven and possibly on one night off the Humber.Five acoustic and 45 magnetic mines have been destroyed during the week,all off the East Coast. The mine totals are 2,393 magnetic, 1,305 acoustic and1,373 moored.Foreign Waters.16. A number of minelaying raids by enemy aircraft have taken place offAlexandria and in the Suez Canal. Up to the present one mine has been destroyed in the Canal and two in Suez Bay. Twelve unexploded mines have been located.Traffic in the Canal has been interrupted.Russian Intelligence.17. Five new Russian destroyers and three old ones of the Russian black sea Fleet are believed to have been lost in the last six months, mainly in the courseof operations round Sebastopol. Some 14 Russian submarines are thought tohave been lost in the Black Sea since the beginning of the Russian war. Theseare not exact figures and losses may be overestimated.MILITARY SITUATION.Egypt.18. On the 2nd July, the enemy, having massed the major portion of his forces opposite the El Alamein position, subjected our troops in this areay?heavy shell-fire and dive-bombing attacks. The threatened attack, however., didnot mature, and our forces counter-attacked from the east and south. A generaengagement developed in the area 6 miles south of El Alamein, and late in &quot;ieevening the enemy was seen to be withdrawing his armour slightly westwards.
19. On the morning of the 3rd July, enemy forces, believed to be mostlyItalian, supported by banks and artillery, thrust southwards in the direction ofBab El Qattara. Our forces repulsed this attack, capturing 28 guns, 300 prisonersarid 100 M.T. In the afternoon, the enemy developed an attack upon our positionssouth of El Alamein, deploying tanks and being supported by artillery. Ourarmoured forces on this occasion destroyed 3 tanks and forced the enemy towithdraw.During the course of the day there were 24 tanks probably destroyed and44 guns and 300 prisoners captured.20. Operations continued during the 4-th July without any substantial change in the fortunes of the battle. An armoured engagement south of el Alamein concluded favourably to us and the enemy made a local withdrawal-During this fighting about 600 Germans were either killed or captured.21. Auction during the 5th July brought no substantial change to the general position. At last light the enemy anti-tank screen, including infantry and88-nun. guns, extended from a point 17 miles S.W. of El Alamein to a pointapproximately 6 miles south. This screen successfully held up our armouredunits, though it was continually engaged by our artillery. The enemy appearedto be extending his right flank westwards as far as a point 35 miles W.S.W. of el Alamein station.22. On the morning of the 6th July, 35 tanks, believed German, were reported stationary in the area 10 miles south of El Alamein with a body of about,000 M.T. slightly to the north-west of them. Columns of our infantry pushednorth during the morning, and by 1100 hours they reached a general line runningeast and west and just south of Deir El Harra.23. During the 7th July, it appeared that the enemy line in the south-eastsalient had been strengthened by German troops and his western flank had been extended with 88-mm. guns. Air reports showed there was heavy enemymovement of M.T. from the centre of his position towards the north and north-west. Columns of our infantry and armour were active, and they dispersedenemy columns, but there was no appreciable general advance. Some 20 enemyguns were silenced during the morning in the area approximately 12 miles south-west of El Alamein.Later in the day a force of enemy tanks, believed to be Italian, moved against our left flank, and our battle groups in that area were withdrawn slowlyaccording to plan. The following night (7th/8th July) one of our patrols carriedout a most successful raid on the central sector of the enemy position, killing14 Germans for certain and probably a further 40, destroying four 50-mm. guns,one 25-pdr., four gun tracks, and two troop carriers; nine prisoners were taken.On the same night one of our motorised columns carried out a successful raid onFuka landing ground. Forty enemy aircraft dispersed on the landing groundwere heavily shelled.24. Air co-operation during this week was on an extensive scale,,unprecedented in the present campaign.Russo-German Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Central Sector.25. The Germans have carried out attacks south-west of Rzhev and, on a smaller scale, in the neighbourhood of Gshatsk, on the railway line Smolensk-Moscow. The operations are probably designed to pin down the Russian forcesin this sector and to eliminate some awkward salients, while the major blows aredelivered further south. In reporting the offensive in the Central Sector, theGermans refer to the attack from Kursk. The Russians themselves have attacked in some strength north of Orel, doubtless with a view to influencing the Kurskbattle.

Apart from the destruction of the considerable Russian forces west ofthe River Don. the German pincer thrust in the Ukraine was undoubtedlydesigned to sever Russian communications between the North and Rostov.Voronezh lies on the main railway line from Moscow to Rostov, and the only other railway line to the Caucasus from the North runs 75-100 miles north-eastand east of Voronezh. Assuming that the Germans have captured the town,it is at least doubtful whether they will attempt to exploit the situation east ofthe River Don before they have disposed of the very large Russian forces west ofthe river and in the country between the Don and the Donets. The destructionof these forces will present no small task.India and Burma.29. The Burma-Assam frontier continues to be quiet. The evacuation ofthe Japanese from Homalin was only temporary. In the Chin Hills an enemydetachment (about 500) at Kalemyo is being reinforced.Floods on the Brahmaputra are receding but still handicap transport and supply movements.Certain Chinese forces are still in Northern Burma moving towards theAssam frontier. They are held up by swollen rivers and are being supplied fromthe air by U.S.A. aircraft. Other Chinese units also in Northern Burma are proceeding to China.Beyond Burma&apos;s eastern frontier, in Yunnan, the Japanese are still west of the Salween River, and have shown no signs of activity for some time.Pacific Area.New Guinea.30. On the night of the 27th/28th June Allied land forces successfullyraided Salamoa, inflicting 85 casualties and capturing equipment and documents,including a map of the defensive dispositions of Port Moresby; our casualties were two wounded.On the night of the 30th June / 1st July Allied land forces attacked a strongenemy outpost eleven miles from Lae. Enemy casualties were 41 killed and manywounded; our casualties were one killed, two wounded, but owing to the enemy ssuperior numbers our forces were subsequently obliged to withdraw.Fiji.31. HQ. and two brigade groups of 37 U.S.A. Division (less about 5,000all ranks still in New Zealand) have arrived in Fiji.A laska.32.   An additional U.S.A. infantry regiment has arrived in Alaska.
Intelligence.prance.33. The 15th and 106th Divisions have been identified in the Bordeaux andCalais areas respectively, to which they have been withdrawn from the eastern front. Both divisions have been reported to have suffered heavy casualties, andit can be assumed that they have been sent to the West to rest and refit. Itmay be the German intention, if circumstances permit, to offset the steady declinein quality of troops in the coastal areas by transferring one or two tired field-array infantry divisions in succession from Russia to France and the low countries. At the same time, reports of troop movements eastwards are stillbeino- received; and it appears that the arrival of 15th and 106th Divisions hasbeen&amp;balanced by the departure of two divisions in the series 300-350.AIR SITUATION.General.34.   Bomber Command aircraft attacked Bremen and Wilhelmshaven.Our air forces in Egypt continued to operate at maximum intensity insupport of our ground forces.Fighters at Malta were very successful in combats with enemy raiders.United Kingdom.35.   Fighter Command flew 685 defensive sorties by day and 362 by night.Enemy daylight operations against this country by bombers and fighter-bombers were slight; two Ju. 88s which dropped bombs in the Midlands were destroyed by Spitfires. Overland reconnaissance was fairly frequent, but was confined almost entirely to brief flights over the south coast.At night two attacks, each by approximately 25 aircraft, were made onMiddlesbrough, and other places between Tyne and Tees. Five enemy bombers were shot down, including one by A.A. fire, and two others were probably destroyed.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.36. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 778 and 18 sorties respec-tively, compared with 775 and 29 last week.Twelve Bostons attacked aerodromes in Holland. Six of these aircraft weremanned by crews of the U.S.A. Army Air Corps, and this marks the first occasion on which they have participated in operations from this country. Low-levelattacks were made at Bergen, Valkenburg and Haamstede. where a parade ofabout 160 Germans in flying kit was effectively machine-gunned.Mosquitoes bombed targets at Flensburg. Photographic assessment of the damage is shown at Appendix VII.From these operations five of our aircraft are missing, including two with.S.A. crews.Sweeps by Fighter Command aircraft were uneventful.flight,37. Bomber Command operated on two nights against land targets,639 sorties being despatched compared with 1,400 last week.The two principal targets were Bremen and the Naval dockyard willhelmshaven. At the former, 510 tons of H.E. and incendiaries were dropped and very many fires were reported, but owing to ground haze these were scatteredwer a wide area, particularly in the Oldenburg, Delmenhorst and Vegesackareas. Photographs taken on the &quot;following day revealed no fresh major damageln Bremen itself.At Wilhelmshaven, visibility was good apart from some ground haze. Aboutw tons of H.E. and incendiaries were dropped, and crews report that well-^ncentrated flares were of great assistance in. identifying the target. Manybursts were seen in the Bauhafen area and close to the Naval dockyard.From these operations 18 bombers are missing.Fighter Command despatched 22 aircraft on &apos;&apos; Intruder &apos;&apos; operations. three enemy aircraft were destroyed.
Coastal Operations.38. Coastal Command flew 565 sorties, 74 of which were engaged on convoy escourt.  Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 681 sortiesA Hudson attacked a 4,000-ton merchant vessel off Borkum, and this was later seen to be on fire from stem to stern.One hundred and sixty-four aircraft of Bomber Command laid 327 sea mines in enemy waters.  Four aircraft are missing.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.39. Light bombers and fighter bombers continued their harassing attacks on enemy gun positions, armour, motor transport and other military targets in the forward area. The effectiveness of these attacks has been confirmed byreconnaissance.On the 7th July one Boston was shot down; this is the first Boston to be lost by enemy fighter action since the present campaign opened, and is a tribute tothe effectiveness of the fighter escorts. From the 22nd May the two SouthAfrican Air Force Squadrons, equipped with this type of aircraft, have flownover 1,500 sorties.Long-range fighters attacked enemy M.T. on his lines of communication.Two successful raids were carried out between Tobruk and Sidi Barrani, whenapproximately 80 vehicles were destroyed or damaged; a number of these were carrying troops who were thrown into considerable confusion.On the 3rd July 680 sorties were flown, which is a new record. On this dayour fighters on offensive patrols destroyed 23 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed or damaged 21 others. Included in the total of destroyed aircraft werefifteen Stuka dive-bombers, one formation of 14 being almost entirely destroyedjust as they were peeling off to bomb our ground forces. On the following dayfive more Stukas were shot down, since when these aircraft have been little inevidence on the battle front. ,A series of succfessf ul attacks were made on German-occupied aerodromes atSidi Barrani, Fuka and El Daba. One surprise raid was made on El Daba by32 fighter bombers at a time when 10 Me.. 109s were refuelling. A bomb burstamongst these fighters and a large fire spread from one aircraft to another; inaddition, four other aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground. At thesame time 10 Me. 109s and Stukas were circling the aerodrome. Five of these were shot down and the remaining five were probably destroyed or damagedwithout any loss to ourselves. During another attack 22 enemy aircraft were damaged on the ground, and in all approximately 70 aircraft were claimed asdestroyed or damaged. The effect of these raids must have seriously affected theserviceability of German forces available in the forward areas.At night Wellingtons attacked enemy concentrations and dumps in the rear of the battle area. In some of these operations Albacores co-operated by droppingflares and very successful results were obtained. On one night two trains west of El Daba were set on fire and another was hit and four trucks blown up. Con-siderable damage was caused to a tank repair unit at El Daba.Heavy attacks were made on the harbours of Benghazi and Tobruk, in someof which U.S.A. crews participated in Liberators. In one raid 16 Liberatorsbombed Benghazi at dusk. During these attacks hits were made on two shipsoutside Benghazi harbour, and another vessel alongside Central Mole blew up with a violent explosion. Other bombs fell near three ships and on convertedwrecks which were being used as landing stages.enemy operations against our forces in the battle area were on a reduced scale, and not more than 30 aircraft operated &quot;at any one time. At night long-range bombers up to 50 in number were largely employed in minelaying operations in the harbour at Alexandria, at Port Said and in the Suez Canal. On one nightfive enemy bombers were shot down by Beaufighters.Malta.40. Attacks on Malta were much more frequent than for some weeks pastEnemy formations normally consisted of approximately five bombers escorted by
i- to 20 fighters. The aerodromes at Luqa, Hal Far, Kalafrana and Takali werethp chief targets, but no serious damage was caused and our fighters operatedffith oreat success against the raiders.On the 6th and 7th July 28 enemy aircraft were shot down, and duringtjje week a total of 54 were destroyed, 13 others probably destroyed and53 damaged.  Our losses in the air were 17 Spitfires, but eight pilots were saved.Sea Communications.41. On the night 2nd/3rd July six Wellingtons from Malta, armed with bombs and torpedoes, attacked an enemy convoy east-south-east of Cape SantaMaria di Lucca; one possible hit and several near misses were made on a vesselo/.5,000 tons.Beauforts and Wellingtons attacked another convoy, comprised of three ships of 7,000 tons escorted by eight destroyers, One vessel was hit with a torpedo and another was probably hit.Burma.42. Blenheims and Mohawks made six small-scale attacks on Kalemyo andtwo on Kwasan. R.A.F. and U.S.A. aircraft also dropped bombs at Allanmyo,Mogaung, Paletwa, Gangaw and Myitkyina, and on three railways stationsbetween Katha and Myitkyina.Supplies were dropped for Chinese forces at Shingbwiyang and at several other places in that area.Pacific Zone.43. U.S.A. and R.A.A.F. aircraft made a total of 11 attacks on targets atLae, and three in the Salamoa area. At the former, it is probable that an enemyheadquarters was hit, and at the latter, numerous fires were reported. In these operations, five enemy fighters were destroyed, two were probably destroyed and five were damaged for the loss of one U.S.A. Marauder.In Timor, attacks were made on Dilli (twice) and on Koepang aerodrome,where three enemy aircraft were probably destroyed on the ground.In the Solomon Islands, R.A.A.F. Gatalinas bombed Halata and Tulagi(twice).In the Celebes, TJ.S.A. Fortresses destroyed three enemy fighters on theground at Kendari aerodrome.Enemy aircraft made four attempts to attack Port Moresby but two of these were intercepted and turned back by U.S.A. Airacobras, four of which are missing. In the other two attacks, the only damage reported is the destructionof a quantity of oil and of one Airacobra on the ground. Small-scale enemy attacks were made on Wau (New Guinea) and Bulolo (110 miles N. of port moresby).Australia.44. Sixteen enemy bombers attacked Horn Island (Torres Straits) causingsome damage to ammunition stocks and transport.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.% day.45. During the evening of the 3rd two enemy aircraft dropped bombs at various points in Derbyshire and at one point in Nottinghamshire. damage was not serious, although some fires were started at New Mills in North Derby-shire and six people were killed at Hayfield, near New Mills.% night.46. Tees-side and Tyne-side were both raided on two successive nights, the&quot;th/7th and 7th/8th, and many fires were started at Middlesborough, Billinghamand Newcastle. On the other nights of the week there was nothing of importanceto record.
Damage.47. -Extensive damage was done to Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltdand the Eurness Shipbuilding Company at Billingham, and slight damage toDorman Long&apos;s, A clam, and Britannia Works at Middlesborough. fm,eechurches, a secondary school and a number of shops and houses at Middlesbroughand the Walkergate Hospital at Newcastle were set on fire. The CerebosSalt Works at Greatham and a gas holder and power-house at West Hartlepoolwere damaged.Casualties.48. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours the8th July are 16 killed and 25 seriously injured.
