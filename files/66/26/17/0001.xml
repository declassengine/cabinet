CUv-t*t/^kw     &apos; erf 7/DOCUiiSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.COPY NO.WAR CABINET.oPROLONGATION OF THE LIFE OF THE UNITED KING-DOMPARLIAMENT AND OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OF NORTHERN IRELAND.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.In the normal course the life of the Parliament of theUnited Kingdom would have expired on the 25th November, 1940,but in 1940 a Bill was passed extending the duration tillNovember, 1941, and in 1941 another Bill was passed extending the time till November, 1942.      The reasons for extending the life of Parliament during the war remain unchanged,  and a thirdBill will be required in the Autumn.I bring the matter before the War Cabinet at this datebecause ori this occasion the question arises of extending the life of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland.      Section 14(4)of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, provides that the Houseof Commons of Northern Ireland &quot;shall unless sooner dissolvedhave continuance for five years from the day on which the summonsdirects the House to meet and no longer&quot;.      The five years willexpire on the 1st March, 1943.Unless therefore there is to be a general election inNorthern Ireland in the early months of next year, legislation will be required in the Parliament of the United Kingdom;and provision on this subject should be included in the Billprolonging the life of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has already beenasked in his House whether any arrangement has been made withthe Imperial Government for legislation on this subject, and hewould be glad to have an early decision so that he may be in aposition to say what is contemplated.The general considerations which make a general electionundesirable in time of war arise in Northern Ireland as inGreat Britain,  and it would not be right for the Government onthe one hand to introduce legislation for prolonging the life of the United Kingdom Parliament till November, 1943, and onthe other hand by refraining from introducing legislation as to northern Ireland to force a general election on NorthernIreland before March, 1943.The question, however, arises whether any legislation onthe subject should be of an enabling rather than a mandatorycharacter, and should make the extension of the life of theNorthern Ireland House of Commons dependent on a resolution ofthat House.     Although the Parliament of Northern Ireland is a subordinate legislature and any amendment of the provisions ofthe Government of Ireland Act, 1920, is a matter for theUnited Kingdom Parliament,  it seems right that on such a question as the prolongation of the life of the House of Commons ofNorthern Ireland in the exceptional circumstances created by war conditions, the members of that House should be consulted.The position of the Parliament of Northern Ireland is not comparable to that of the council of a local authority,      the parliament of Northern Ireland is a legislative body with power^0 make laws for the peace, order and good government ofNorthern Ireland on all subjects except those which arespecifically reserved by the Government of Ireland Act, and the

decision whether the circumstances in Northern Ireland are such that a general election before March 1943 would- he undesirableought, I suggest, to he left to the Northern Ireland House,The Northern Ireland Ministers favour this course,  andthe Prime Minister of Northern Ireland tells me that he hasconsulted the Members of Parliament who sit in the UnitedKingdom Parliament for Northern Ireland constituencies and theysupport this proposal.The position of the Register of Electors is the same inNorthern Ireland as in Great Britain. No Register has beenprepared since that of 1939,No question arises about prolonging the life of theNorthern Ireland Senate.      The Senators are elected by theNorthern Ireland House of Commons.I ask for the authorisation of the War Cabinet to announce that the Government contemplate introducing legislation in the Autumn for prolonging the life of the United kingdom parliament for another year from November, 1942, and that they propose to include in the Bill a provision enabling the life ofthe House of Commons of Northern Ireland to be prolonged fora year from March, 1943, provided such prolongation is approvedby a resolution of the Northern Ireland House of Commons.H.M.HOME OFFICE.9th July 1942.
