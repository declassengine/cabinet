TS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC/MAJESTY1 S GOVERNM5ITC?);PY NO.,WAR CABINETCARRYING OF GAS MASKS BY THE    PUBLIC.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security.At a Meeting on 16th February last (W.M. (42) 21stConclusion) the War Cabinet considered a proposal Iin W.P.(42) 76 that there should be aexisting injunctions to the civilto carry their gas masks.    This policy was by a similar policy for the fightingservices.    The War Cabinet decided that the moment wasinappropriate for such relaxation.submitted to themrelaxation of thepopulation always to be accompaniedI feel that the time has come to ask the War Cabinetto reconsider their decision.    In my judgment the argumentsincluded in W.P. ( 42) 76 have been strengthened:(l) by the increasing seriousness of the rubber shortage,which renders it all-important to conserve the stocksof gas masks already issued and in reserve.    Owing torubber restrictions imposed,  the target figure of reserves which it is desired to reach cannot now in anycase be achieved before the end of 1942, and continuanceof any appreciable wastage will postpone it still further;(2) by the wastage which is occurring throughout the country,almost always arising from damage caused by the constant carriage of respirators.    This is particularlyexemplified in the case of schoolchildren, who are compelled to take their respirators with them to school.Gases are being reported of large areas in which the replacement of respirators carried by schoolchildrenamounts to 100 per cent,  and even more, per annum.    Itis impossible to deal satisfactorily with this problemso long as the Government1s declared policy is that thepublic should carry their respirators always.The essential thing is to ensure that everyone shouldpossess a well-fitting respirator,   in good order and readily available, of which he or she fully understands the use.    Thenecessity for maintaining such standard, so long and carefullyplanned to meet emergency, cannot be over-emphasised.    Thefragility of respirators has to be recognised, and from thatfollows the desirability of modifying, at this stage of thewar, a policy which was suited to previous circumstances.The fragility,  in the case of civilian respirators, probablyincreases with the age of the respirators, and rough usage isnow more serious than it was two years ago. . I therefore askfor a reconsideration of the proposals put forward on16th February and of the Cabinet&apos;s decision thereon.If it is decided to authorize a relaxation of theexisting practice the conditions set out in the Report of theHome Defence Committee attached to W.P.(42) 76 would apply.H.M,HOME OFFICE.Igth July.  1942.
