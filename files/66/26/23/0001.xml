SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.We summarise our conclusions as follows: (a) On the assumptions set out in paragraph 3 below (with regard to ship-building, losses, service requirements, civil requirements other than UnitedKingdom imports, and American assistance), total non-tanker ocean-borneimports may be estimated for the year 1942 at some 25  million tons and maybe provisionally placed for the iirst six months of 1943 at 9  million tons, giving a total of 35 million tons for the eighteen-month period. Of this figure importsof food and materials amount to 33 million tons.   (Paragraphs 3 and 4.)(b) The net consumption of importable food and materials for the sameperiod, assuming the continuance of our present consumption policy, would amount to 41-4 million tons, leaving a deficiency of 8-4 million tons. (Para-graphs 5 to 8.)(c) If stocks were reduced to the minimum by the 30th June, 1943, a saving of import requirements could be obtained of 6 -15 million tons. It would,however, in any case, be hazardous to run down stocks to this extent, and itwould be out of the question to do so unless we could rely on obtaining, duringthe second half of 1943, sufficient assistance from the United States to enable us to import on a scale which would cover our consumption. This is likely to benot less than 15 million tons (as compared with an expected import of 9  million tons in the first half of the year). This level of imports would be barely sufficientto meet current requirements and would leave no margin for building up stocks to meet- unforeseen emergencies.   (Paragraphs 10, 11 and 24.)(d) We have examined a number of possible methods by which theconsumption of imports might be reduced, as follows : (i) Obtaining additional supplies of food from home production.   (This isin large part dependent on factors, e.g., the weather, which are outside our control.)(ii) A further raising of the milling ratio.(iii) Dilution of bread with rye, oats and barley.   The use of the latter asa diluent would involve a serious reduction in the output of beer.(iv) Drawing upon the reserve of meat on the hoof.(v) Reduction in consumption of fertilisers.(vi) Reduction in consumption of materials (including steel) for purposes other than direct war production.   (Paragraphs 12 to 16.)[23962]B
(e) We have also examined the possibilities of economising shipping used forpurposes other than bringing imports to the United Kingdom. A large part ofour total tonnage is employed in the interest of the fighting services, and anveconomy here would bring substantial relief to the United Kingdom importposition. For example, it is estimated that, if 100,000 tons of cargo shipping-were transferred from combined military and importing use to purely importingwork on the North Atlantic for a period of twelve months, there would be a netgain of imports into the United Kingdom of 375,000 tons. (Paragraphs17 to 19.) s v(f) The extent to which it will be necessary to modify our present consump-tion policy in order to reduce import requirements will depend not only on thedemands of the fighting services but also on the scale on which we obtainassistance from the United States, both during the eighteen months ending30th June, 1943, and during the ensuing period. (See Conclusion (c) above.)5For example, without additional assistance before mid-194i3, we should be obliged to run down stocks to minimum levels, and, in addition, to effectdrastic consumption economies of the type listed at (d) above. If, on theother hand, we were to obtain from the United States sufficient tonnage tobring in an additional 2 million tons of imports in the first half of 1943, the gap could be bridged either by running down stocks to the full extent shown at(c) above (less any windfall supplies which might accrue from a good harvest) orby a combination of destocking and consumption economies. (Paragraphs20 to 24.)(g) It would, in our view, be unwise to await a precise intimation fromthe United States Government of the amount of tonnage they propose to make available for our assistance before taking action to reduce import requirements.We are of the opinion that steps should be taken at once to consider sucheconomies as will on any prudent view of the future be necessary to safeguard theposition.   (Paragraphs 25 and 28.). Part 2. REPORT.Introductory.1. By our terms of reference we are directed to prepare periodical reviews of the shipping situation.2. In this report we have attempted to survey the outlook for some distanceahead and to consider whether, on the evidence available, our present rate otconsumption of imported food and raw materials can be justified or whether thereis a danger that, in the early months of 1943, a situation might arise in whichwe should have to choose between the requirements of our military plans and theessential needs of civilian consumption.Importing Capacity of Available Shipping.3. Excluding any further American assistance, the amount of ocean-bornenon-tanker imports into the United Kingdom may amount to about 25^ million tons in 1942 (based upon an estimate by the Ministry of War Transport of importsfalling within the range of 24-27 million tons), and to about 9^ million tons inthe first six months of 1943. This estimate, which is necessarily provisional anasubject to relatively wide deviations, is conditioned by the following assumptions : (a) that the output of ocean-going non-tanker tonnage in the UnitedKingdom, Canada and Australia will be approximately 1 - 4 million gross tons in 1942 and -8 million gross tons in the first half of 1943;,(&amp;) that losses, from all causes, of ocean-going non-tanker tonnage operating in British interests will be about 3-3 million gross tons in 1942 andsomewhat less than half that figure in the first half of 1943;(c) that, as now foreshadowed by the War Office, the requirements of thefighting services for military purposes, including British comnnt-ments for shipments to North Russia and the Bolero movement, will call for an effective increase of not more than 1 million gross tons of ocean-going non-tanker tonnage during the period May to the end of 19*-&apos;and a further -5 million gross tons in the first half of 1943, exclusivein each case of vessels under repair.  (The Ministry of War Transport,
however, in framing their estimate of imports into the UnitedKingdom have made allowance for the fact that it is unlikely that allthe additional demands would materialise simultaneously and thatcertain of them would continue for limited periods only.)(d) that there will be no material alteration in the tonnage specificallyrequired for civil imports into areas other than the United Kingdom;(e) that, apart from tonnage accruing to this country under the ToddAgreement (-4 million gross tons, all of which is expected to become available during 1942), the existing measure of United states assistance will be maintained but not increased.4. Support is given to the above estimate of United Kingdom imports by an estimate for the first eight months of this year, based on achieved imports and on recent and prospective loadings. This indicates an import from january to August of between 16-j and 17 million tons.Consumption of Imports.5. The following table shows the estimated net consumption of importablefood and materials as expected to result from present plans and policies, excluding any consumption of food and materials consequent on new operations such asBolero. (It is assumed that these requirements will bs met from imports not included in the 25^ million tons mentioned in paragraph 3.) Net consumption in this context means consumption less home production less any imports from eire not included in &quot; home production,&quot; and can only be met from importsplus stock reductions.First half,        Jan. 1, 1942-1942. 1943.

The prospective import of &quot; Munitions and Miscellaneous &quot; (the formerBoard of Trade programme) cannot be closely estimated but may be pwt at11 million tons in 1942 and -9 million tons in the first half of 1943. Of thistobacco and other non-Government imports account for -22 in 1942 and -12in the first half of 1943.Imports and Consumption of Imports.7.   The import situation may therefore be set forth thus :First half, Jan. 1, 1942-1942.                   1943. June 30, 1943.(Million tons.)Ocean-borne imports    ...   25 - 5                9-5 35-less munitions. &amp;c    ...     1-1                  -9 2-0Import    of    food    and    i               -- -materials       ......   24-4                8-6 33 0Net     consumption     ofimportable   food   and materials       ......   27-5              13-9 41-4Deficiency ......     3-1 5-3 8-4Import Situation in 1942.8. The minimum import requirements for 1942 were fixed in Januaryat 26 million tons, but since then the milling ratio has been increased, estimates of home food production have been revised upward, certain reductions havebeen made in the consumption of materials and food, minimum stockrequirements of materials have been revised downward, and supplies of munitions to be imported have not reached the level expected. It now appears that withan importation in 1942 of 25^ million tons, or even 24 million tons (the lowestlevel envisaged by the Ministry of War Transport), stocks would not be reduced[23962] b 2
below minimum working levels by the end of the year. It would be dangeroushowever, to allow stocks to fall so far during 1942 that they would be inadequate to tide us over the subsequent half-year. It is, therefore, necessary to considerthe eighteen-month period to the middle of 1943 as a whole, and to see what steps have to be taken to bridge the gap of 8-4 million tons between-net consumption and imports.Import Situation tip to mid-1943: Means of Bridging the Gap.9. There are five principal courses of action which might be adoptedseverally or in combination to bring available imports and import requirements inthe eighteen months ending the 30th June, 1943, into equality:  (a) destocking;(b) reduction in consumption of imports (United Kingdom);(c) economising in the use of shipping for civilian purposes other than united Kingdom imports;id) economising in the use of shipping by the armed forces; and(e) obtaining assistance in shipping from the United States.(In view of the recent decisions, taken by the Defence Committee (D.C. (S.)(42) 3rd Meeting) regarding the priority status of shipbuilding, the transfer oflabour to shipyards and marine engineering establishments, and the order of priority within the Admiralty programme, we have not so far enquired into thepossibilities of relieving the shipping situation through increased merchant ship-building.)Destocking.10. It is estimated by the Ministry of Food that stocks could be reducedover the eighteen-month period by 1-05 million tons and by the Office of theMinister of Production that materials stocks could be reduced by 5-1 million tons, without cutting below the minimum working stocks set out in Tables I and ii respectively of Appendix A.11. Destocking of this order could, however, be safely embarked upon only if it were morally certain that the shipping situation of the United Nations inthe second half of 1943 and thereafter would be such as to permit us to importon a scale sufficient to cover our reasonable requirements without further drawingupon stocks. To ensure this our need of American assistance will be even greater in the second half than in the first half of 1943.Reduction in Consumption of Imports: Food.12. (a) 840,000 tons of wheat equivalent might on certain assumptions beobtained for human consumption from the 1942 harvest, additional to the quantityassumed in paragraph 5 above when estimating net consumption of importedfoods. The make-up of the increase, which is contingent upon target acreagesbeing attained, crop yields being average, and a smaller proportion of productionbeing retained on farms, is analysed in Appendix B. Perhaps two-thirds of theincrease is dependent upon factors, such as weather, which are beyond humancontrol, and only one-third on measures of policy. As partial offsets to this increase, some 60,000 additional tons of wheat equivalent may be required for seedpurposes, and some 25,000 additional tons of imports of concentrated foods maybe required to compensate for the reduction in home output of livestock productsresulting from the fall in the quantity of crops retained on farms.(b) If the milling ratio were increased to 95 per cent, now, a net importeconomy of some 265,000 tons might be achieved within the period, allowancebeing made for the import of concentrated foodstuffs to replace the consequentialfalling off in home output of livestock products and for extra consumption o.foods due to inability of the body to digest the full nutritional value of 95 percent, flour. If the milling ratio were raised to 90 per cent, some 150,000 tonsof imports might be saved.(c) Dilution of bread of 95 per cent, extraction by rye, barley and oats mightyield a net import economy of 530,000 tons in a full year. With an extractionratio of 90 per cent, the economy secured by dilution would be some 30,000 tonsmore. Dehusking machinery for the milling of oats might not be installed torsix months, but a start could be made before then in building up a stock of home-grown oats. The use of barley as a diluent (which accounts for some 250,000 tonsof the total import saving) would have the effect of cutting the beer output in halt.
(d) The reserve of meat on the hoof, including the breeding stock of thebeef herds and their replacements is estimated at not more than 486,000 tons.This estimate, however, is on the most favourable assumptions, and wouldirobably not be realised in practice. Moreover, the bulk of the additional meatwould be of low grade, suitable only for manufacture. The emergency slaughterof 10 per cent, of home-bred beef cattle, and 20 per cent, of ewes, all the wethers,and all lambs not required for replacement purposes, would provide in the twelvemonths to June 1943 an addition of up to 100,000 tons of home-produced meatover normal supplies, and would save shipping space for a corresponding volumeof imports. This, however, would be at the expense of reductions in supplies ofhome-produced meat in the following and subsequent years; and would raiseo-rave issues of agricultural policy that would need the most careful consideration.13. The saving in imports which would result from the full programme of consumption economies set forth under (b), (c) and (d) amounts to 895,000 tons.If 500,000 tons is added as a mean probable figure for the additional supplies offood from home production, which may be expected under (a), the aggregatesaving in imports would amount to approximately 1,400,000 tons. This aggregatewould be reduced by 85,000 tons if the milling ratio were raised to 90 per cent,only instead of 95 per cent.; by 250,000 tons if barley were not used for thedilution of bread; and by 100,000 tons if the slaughter policy were not applied.14.   In examining possible savings in the consumption of food imports wehave not considered any measure which would result in a reduction of the energyvalue of the people&apos;s diet below its present level which is regarded by the Ministryof Food as the minimum compatible with health and efficiency.Reduction in the Consumption of Imports: Materials.15. (a) If stocks of phosphate rock were allowed to fall to zero by mid-1943as a part of the reduction in stocks referred to in paragraph 10 above (see alsoAppendix A), imports of fertilisers from mid-1942 to mid-1943 would be about400.000 tons. Any reduction in imports below this figure would diminish thesupplies of superphosphate available for the 1942-43 season. A reduction of400,000 tons of imports of fertilisers (i.e., no imports after June 1942) would reduce the phosphates available for the 1942-43 season by about two-thirds.This would result in a loss in home food production for the 1943 harvest Whichcould only be made up by the use in the following year of between 2 and 3times the shipping space originally saved. The Minister of Agriculture has justannounced plans for a substantial increase in food production in 1943 in orderto save shipping, and any action that would reduce supplies of fertilisers below7the present programme might appear to be inconsistent with this policy.(b) It is unlikely that imports of steel and steel-making materials could bereduced by more than 400,000 tons without cutting into direct war production.This would involve a consumption rate of steel (including home production) of11-4 million tons in 1942 and 5-75 in the first half of 1943, and would mean that steel supplies would be restricted for purposes for which they are nowregarded as essential, e.g., the less vital needs of the Services Passive Defence,maintenance of productive and of transportation equipment. Long-term construc-tion programmes might also have to be postponed.(c) The Office of the Minister of Production considers that a saving of200.000 tons might be achieved by consumption economies in materials other thansteel. These economies would fall mainly on civilian consumption, which hasalready been reduced nearly to the limit.16. The economies mentioned under (a), (b) and (c) above amount, in aggregate, to about 1 million tons.Economies in Shipping for Civil Purposes outside United Kingdom.,17. A limited amount of British-controlled tonnage is employed in carryingcivil requirements to a number of areas other than the United Kingdom,wherever possible, however, such civil supplies are carried either as part cargoesHi vessels allocated for military stores or in vessels which proceed to the area for purpose of loading back for the United Kingdom import programme,programmes of essential civil requirements for the Middle East, Persian Gulf,hidia and West Africa are carefully examined both in the territories concernedaiid in London and are reduced to the bare minimum necessary for maintaining
the economic and political stability of the territories concerned. CertainDominion requirements have to be met, and these also have been drastically cutboth as regards bulk cargo and general cargo. British-controlled tonnage is alsoemployed in carrying re-export nitrate from Chile to the eastern seaboard of north America and in meeting the coal requirements of the Red Sea and indian ocean areas. Some of the shipping used for these purposes is not capable oftrading to the United Kingdom. We intend to give fuller consideration to thisquestion in the near future, but at first examination it does not appear probablethat further material reductions can be effected in the use of shipping for these purposes.Service Economies.IS. An important element in the total employment of shipping is thetonnage used for service purposes. The amount of British-controlled merchantshipping allocated to the fighting service at the end of March was 4-8 million gross tons (exclusive of ships under repair), of which some -85 million was engaged in the carriage of military stores on the outward voyage and would beavailable for carrying imports to the United Kingdom on the inward voyage.In addition, some merchant tonnage allocated to the fighting services is engaged on routes outside the United Kingdom, although not all of this is suitable fortrading to the United Kingdom; and substantial quantities of military supplies are carried as part cargo in liners not allocated to the fighting services. It is evident that any saving which could be made in this sphere would have aconsiderable effect on our importing capacity for the civil programme. Forexample, it is estimated that the transfer of 100,000 gross tons of merchantshipping from employment in carrying military stores on outward voyages fromthe United Kingdom and imports on homeward voyages to the United kingdom to import service on the North Atlantic route would, if the tonnage were retainedon the North Atlantic service for .12 months, enable us to import in that period,net, an additional 375,000 tons of food or raw materials. The corresponding reduction in military shipments to the East, in terms of vehicles, which have ingeneral determined the shipping required, would be about 6,000 vehicles perannum with present methods of packing. Actual shipments to the Middle East,Persian Gulf and India from the United Kingdom and North America duringthe first 4 months of this year have been at the rate of 220,000 vehicles per annum.It should be noted that the transfer of 100,000 gross tons in the mannermentioned above would involve a reduction on average of only about one half that amount in the tonnage &apos;&apos; Allocated to the Fighting Services &apos;&apos; shown in theMinistry of War Transport Employment returns. The reason for this is that thevessels are classified for the purpose of the returns as &apos;&apos; Allocated to the FightingServices &quot; only whilst they are carrying military stores, &amp;c, on the outwardvoyage from the United Kingdom.19. We have given some attention to possible economies in the use ofshipping by the Services. The issues raised are, however, either so wide in scope(e.g. the size of our forces in overseas theatres, the scale of reserves andmaintenance, &amp;c.) as to be beyond our competence, or, on the other hand, of sucha technical character (dismantling and packing of vehicles, aircraft, &amp;c.) thatwe have not been able to examine them in any detail. Questions of this latterkind are being examined by a departmental Committee recently set up by theMinistry of War Transport, on which the War Office and Air Ministry are represented. Already additional steps have been taken to improve the packingof load-carrying vehicles shipped from this country including a new economicalpack of 15-cwt. lorries. Reports are awaited from the War Office and AirMinistry on the breaking down and packing of certain technical vehicles.There is, however, scope for further economy in the use of shipping by the armed Forces in such matters as the source of supply and routeing of military stores, the packing of vehicles, the crating of aircraft and possibly some breaking&apos;down of landing craft. It is not possible to assess the results in figures and itseems desirable to treat any such economies as a partial offset against thepossibility of additional military demands on shipping due to unforeseen changesin the strategical situation, to which any forecast of Service requirements mustbe subject. We propose to keep this matter under review and hope to submit afurther report at a later date.
Situation in absence of further United States aid.20. It is appropriate to summarise the situation at this point before considering the remaining factor to be taken into account, viz., american assistance.[million tons)Food        Materials       TotalPossible destocking     ...       ...       x-05 5-1 6-15Possible    reduction    in    con-sumption of imports       ...       1-4 1-0 2-4Possible   reduction   in   import      _ _requirements        ...       ...      2-45 6-1 8-&quot;&quot;Original deficiency      ...       ... 8-4^Balance   ...      ...      . &quot;&quot;&quot;715The effect of the destocking and consumption economies on importing require-ments is shown in the following table:  Requirementsbeforeadaptation Requirements(-s-s net afterconsumption). adaptation.

It appears, therefore, that by the full application of the measuresdescribed, the &quot; gap &apos;&apos; would be almost exactly filled. This, however, would involvealterations in diet and drastic restrictions in other civilian consumption, serious location of agricultural and other production, a very close paring of steelrequirements, which in some circumstances would hamper the execution of programmes, and a running down of stocks to levels which would not be justifiedsave on the assurance of adequate American assistance from the second&apos; half of1943 onwards. Moreover, imports might well fall short of the target figure forthe eighteen months by as much as 2 million tons. This serves to emphasise theimportance of securing United States assistance in the first half of 1943. thoughit would be imprudent to rely entirely upon such assistance for a solution.United States Assistance.22. United States new building in 1942 (excluding vessels building for us)may amount, for non-tankers, to some 3-5 million gross tons. Losses of UnitedStates and of Allied and neutral tonnage not trading in British interests havebeen estimated for 1942 at 1 - 2 million gross tons. The net gain of United Statescontrolled tonnage over the year is hardly likely to be much more than2-3 million gross tons and might be less if the recent rate of losses were tocontinue. Expanded calls on United States shipping, in connexion with the newRussian Protocol, the Bolero movement and other military movements, may absorba large part of the net gains. It is unlikely that the United States will be ableto make available to us much, if any, non-tanker tonnage additional to that whichhas already been provided.23. In the first half of 1943 the outlook is more promising. United Statesproduction of dry-cargo ocean-going tonnage is programmed to amount to3&apos;8 million gross tons over the six months. Losses may amount to more than&apos;6 million gross tons, and net gain to rather less than 3-2 million gross tons.H one-third of this net gain could be devoted to our assistance, and were spreadgradually over the period, it would probably bring in about 2 million tons ofadditional imports.24. In the second half of 1943, the excess of United States building overlosses in the category of vessel under consideration should amount to almost4 million gross tons. This gives grounds for hope that United States assistance will be sufficient, together with our own resources, to enable us to import at least.
some 15 million tons in the second half of 1943. Only if we achieve this rateof importation can we run down stocks to the levels envisaged in Appendix A by mid-1943 without danger of an interruption of production in the subsequentperiod. Even then we should be running at a low level of consumption, withoutany margin for the rehabilitation of stocks or for unforeseen emergencies.Conclusion.25. Our conclusion is that there is a considerable gap between the consump-tion of imported food and raw materials as at present planned during the eighteen months ending the 30th June, 1943, and the imports which we may expect toreceive during that period. The gap can to some extent be bridged by running down stocks; but some reduction in consumption of imports appears on presentprospects to be inevitable. And a very early decision to enforce economies willbe needed if stocks are to be maintained at a level which will enable us to face the comparatively low rate of imports which on present information we areentitled to expect in 1943. If we had to depend on our own resources alone, the economies necessary would be of a most drastic kind. We consider, therefore,that a strong case could, if necessary, be made to the United States Governmentfor some further assistance in meeting our difficulties. The United StatesGovernment have, however, hitherto been unwilling to commit themselves inadvance to afford us any definite measure of assistance, though they have alwaysbeen ready to help us in meeting any urgent and specific need.26. Whatever the contribution to a solution of the problem which may beobtained from American assistance and from economies in civil consumption ofimports, it is essential that the greatest possible economy of shipping space shouldbe achieved in meeting Service needs, particularly since, in our view, we are approaching the limit of possible economies in civilian consumption.Signed on behalf of the Committee :HARCOURT JOHNSTONE.Great George Street, S.W.1,June 22, 1942.Chairman.

In the absence of experience ofworking with stocks at these levels it is impossible to say exactly what the degree of interferencewith production would be. It is thought, however, that delay to direct war production would be avoided.(b) The figures in the table are for stocks at steel works and at Ministry of Supply yards.Stocks with consumers might be approximately 2-J million tons.(c) Assuming full achievement of the steel substitution programme and of other economies.(d) It is assumed that stocks of phosphate rock for fertiliser have been cut down to nil andthe remaining stocks are for industrial purposes only. Such a step would bring the productionof superphosphates to a stop for the time being, but would not interfere with the consumption ofsuperphosphate in the 1942-43 fertiliser season. In order to avoid interference with the supplyof superphosphate in the 1943-44 season, imports of phosphate rock would have to be resumedearly in the second half of 1943, which would involve an additional burden on internal transporta-tion in the second half of 1943. There is, moreover, a risk that there might be some short fall,which would be reflected in a reduction of home food production at the 1944 harvest. If this expedient of a temporary cessation of superphosphates production were not resorted to, minimumstocks of phosphate rock would have to be set 100,000 tons higher.

The economies under paragraph 12 (a), so far as increased output from farms is concerned, 12 (b) and 12 (c), would have considerable repercussions on farming operations. There would have to be reductions in the numbers ofcertain kinds of livestock, mainly pigs and poultry, but also partly beef cattle,and these would in turn have serious consequences on crop production. Inaddition, the whole basis of the feeding stuffs rationing scheme would have to be revised in order to keep to the minimum any loss in milk production.xAliowances have been made in the calculations for the consequent loss of livestock products, but on the assumption that the livestock are feel entirely onthe feeding stuffs diverted to human consumption. In practice the livestocksubsist partly on swill and roughages, and the actual loss would be greater thanthe theoretical figures. On the other hand, no allowance has been made for anygain in meat supplies due to the immediate slaughter of additional numbers of beef cattle, partly because loss of feeding stuffs of this order would more probablyresult in slaughter at lower weights and/or lengthening of the fattening period,especially where the cattle are valued for the production of dung. (In the caseof poultry the increase of poultry meat due to extra slaughter would not be significant. In the case of pigs any immediate gain in pigmeat from extraslaughter would be more than offset within the )rear.)
