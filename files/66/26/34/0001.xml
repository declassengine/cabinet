THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1942.MOST. SECRET. Copy No.   13W.P. (42) 304.July 20, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.GERMAN ARMAMENT SUPPLIES TO TURKEY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.- (N.B. This memorandum is based in part on most secret and delicate sources and the utmost secrecy must be preserved regarding its contents.)THERE is ample evidence that the Germans have embarked on a policy inTurkey aimed at ousting us.from our position as the principal supplier of Turkishindustrial and military requirements, in the hope of thereby undermining thewhole Turco-British connexion. The most striking feature of this policy is theoffer by Germany of large quantities of war material, including nearly 200 tanks,several hundred anti-tank guns and light anti-aircraft guns, as well as fighter and bomber aircraft. The price demanded for this equipment is just under400 million marks.2. The original agreement for the supply of these armaments provided only for an expenditure of 100 million marks to be covered by a credit. The TurkishSecretary-General has assured His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that the TurkishGovernment will not accept anything that costs more than a total of 100 to 110million marks, but it is problematical whether the Turks will refuse the balanceof such valuable equipment, none of which we or the Americans can supply. Ifthese armaments are accepted by the Turkish Government, Germany will go far to renew the stranglehold she had on Turkish economy in the years immediately preceding this war. Already semi-official proposals are being discussed in Berlinbetween Dr. Clodius and a Turkish delegation to discover ways and means whereby the extra cost of these armaments, over and above the agreed 100 million markcredit, can be covered. These include some form of barter agreement which would cover a wide range of Turkish products at present purchased by us for supplyor pre-emptive reasons.3. There &quot;is no reason to doubt that the Germans are in earnest in theirpromise to deliver this equipment within, say, the next six months and, if they doso, the comparison of their supplies with those which we have delivered will be extremely unfavourable to us. In 1939 we and the French granted the TurkishGovernment an armaments credit of  25 million. To-day, three years later, no more than half of this has been used. If, therefore, the Germans fulfil theirpromises, they will be supplying Turkey in a sixth of the time with three times as much equipment as we have done.4. Present circumstances make it impossible for us to outbid this Germanoffer ourselves and there seems little we can do. But I felt bound to bring thesituation to the notice of my, colleagues, and I hope that the supply departments will do everything in their power at least to maintain the present flow of supplies to Turkey. &quot;A.
