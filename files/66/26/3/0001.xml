rOHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT. ):U2) 275, COPY NO,   ^j,Ufh June. 1942*I WAR_CABINET.IDISCUSSIONS IN WASHINGTON ON POST-W$R RELIEF0Memorandum by the Chancellor of ;:thp JE-r..^\c1;      I have three major points to raise regarding the  in*-stractions which it is proposed, in paragraph 5 or &apos;&amp;x*. iTar*^aa&amp;Tsa&quot;By the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,,, the ProGla.:?.&apos;;:!- ofthe Board of Trade and the Paymaster Senegal,  should do givento Sir Frederick Leith*Ross-0(i)    It is suggested that, if the question is raised as tothe contribution in food and raw materials which theU.K. are j)repared to make, Sir Fc Leith-Ross should refer to the Prime Minister1s statement in August 1940oThis statement was to the effect that we would arrangein advance for the entry of food into any area freed from enemy occupation and that we would do our best toencourage the x lilding up of reserves of food for thispurpose all over the world0    A good deal has happenedsince then and a reference to this statement would imply that it is the basis on which we have in fact been acting and propose to continue to act0    But theMinistry of Food have not found it practicable,, owingto all that has occurred since August 1940P to makeany arrangements of the type indicated.    Moreover,the statement referred to foodstuffs only and notto raw materials0    It seems to me therefore that a reference to this statement, the phrasing of which isno longer apposite to existing conditionsj, must create a misleading impression, and other wording must befoundo(ii)    I think it is desirable to draw a distinction betweenthe physical, or supply &quot;aspect of the problem andthe financial aspecti    otherwise we may well find ourselves drifting into onerous commitments withoutany cSLhar appreciation of their effecto    As regardsthe supply aspect,, we can properly promise to help to the fullest extent of our ability,;      The financial aspect is closely connected with the wider questionof the. problem of our balance of payments after thewar and of the whole series of questions which will come up for discussion in the course of the conversationsunder Article 7 of the Mutual Aid agreement    The-   distinction between the supply aspect and the financial aspect would be readily understood by the UoS0Administration since it is a favourite distinction of president Roosevelt&apos;s in connection with the war-timesupply problems of the United Nations0

(lii)    The statement that we shall be prepared to placeany stocks which are not immediately needed for ourown requirements at the disposal of theInternational Relief Organisation xs appropriate  asregards stocks.-in the u...K5 9 srhich can be sent to europe for immediate relief far more quickly thanstocks in distant overseas countries,-,    Theproposal made ir. the Memorandum submitted by thePresident of the Board of Trade to the ministerial Committee on Reconstruction problems on the 22nd May was that, subject to suitablesafeguards^  stocks in the UeK0 should be availablefor the urgent relief needs of other countries andthat such stocks should be subject to replacementwhen supplies are available from more distantsources0    I think that the instructions toSir P0 Leith-Ross should be in this sense0The question of stocks held Overseas.; eag,;  woolin Australia or cotton in Egypt; inevitably raisesthe question how far our post-war position willmake it possible for us to contribute an important part of our external assets as a donation to relief and not to use them to pay for  the i&quot; r;eifLv necessaryto maintain a tolerable standard of life in thiscountry.    This  is a matter on which we cannot enterinto commitments until progress has been made withthe conversations under Article 7 of the mutual aid Agreement,    It is doubtful whether there willbe any need to draw on these supplies to any considerable extent for urgent relief purposes andthe main importance attaching to them is therefore that of finance or foreign exchange,,    I cannotassent to the pledging at this stage for reliefpurposes of some of the most important of our few remaining foreign exchange assets0    I should add that the conception of replacement from more distant sources is not applicable to these supplies0The United States Administration will not be in aposition to enter into definite commitments until they have obtained the approval of Congress and itseems reasonable that we on our side should not beasked to enter into definite commitments on amatter of this kind at the present stage02*      I attach a suggested revise of paragraph 5 of theMemorandum to meet the above oointSo3e      In paragraph 6 the question is submitted whetherMinisters approve a promise that we will maintain a system of rationing and other controls in the U.k10   so long as necessaryto ensure the minimum supplies of the liberated countries, andwhether this should be either (l) announced by Ministers in theU*Ke  or (2) announced by Sir F, Leith-Ross in the course of his-      discussions in the United-States,    My view on this is that itwould be most undesirable if the general public in thiscountry should first hear of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on a matter of this kind through some prouncementby our representative in the course of discussions with theUnited States Administration in Washingtonj    and that anannouncement on the lines of the formula should be made, if A.M      all, by Ministers in this country.    I think- myself it would be undesirable that we should so pledge ourselves in advance.    Itwould, I think, be advisable to leave this matter for thepresentftK.WoNasury Chambers,I *&quot;th June, 19420

Suggested recast of paragraph 3C.The next question likely to be discussed is as to how supplies of fcod-stuffs and raw materials can be madeavailable to the relic:? organisation.    Sir Frederick Leith-Rossshould ascertain what proposals the United States Governmenthave :&apos; a mine on this subject and whether obey con template theextension of lease-lond supplies or the prevision of&quot;creditsor relief donations,,    Should the question be raised as tothe contribution which the United Kingdom Government areprepared to malce^ Sir Frederick Leith-Ross should point outthat the question has t-.ro aspects, the physical or supplyaspect, and the financial aspect,,    As regards the former,he should say that His Majosty5 s Government are ready to help to the fullest extent of their ability in making both supplies and shipping available.    But he should point out that wecannot say yet what our own position will be after the war,and what stocks will in fact be available over and above ourown needsf;    The supply of raw materials required for thepurpose of restoring industry and employment in the liberated countries is on a somuwhab different plane from the supplyof food and other necessities of life and raises wider andmore complicated issues,,    It would be necessary to ascertain the views and intentions 03? the Ut.S0 Administration,whichit will be remembered., will not supply us with raw materialseven in war time except under conditions intended to safe-guard their own export trade    Sir Frederick Leith-Rosscould, however,  say that, in so far as we hold any stocks and stores in this country after the war which are not immediately needed for our own requirements? we shall beprepared to place them at the disposal of the internationalRelief Organisation subject to replacement as soon as possible.As regards the financial aspect of the general question, our capacity to render assistance is necessarilyaffected by the prospect that we shall have ourselves to face a heavy adverse balance of payments after the warQLarge issues of policy are accordingly, involved, which will presumably be considered in wider discussionso    If pressed for any further statement on the subject, Sip Frederick should therefore, while stating that it will be the policy of HisMajesty?s Government to do all that we can to assist,-, say thathe is not authorised to enter into any definite commitments,expressing the belief that those matters could be more easilycleared up after the general economic discussions have been advanced farther0    The stocks and stores that may be held byHis Majesty&apos;s Government outside this country should in generalbe regarded as belonging to the financial rather than tothe supply aspect of the problem^    so that no definitecommitments with regard to them could be given at present.
