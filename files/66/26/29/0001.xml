ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 299.July 14, 1942.EVACUATION OF POLISH AND GREEK REFUGEES FROM THEMIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Minister of State in several recent telegrams has emphasised the dangers of the accumulation of refugees, chiefly Poles and Greeks, at various points in the Middle East. His concern is not with resident communities, for whom the general rule is that they shall &quot; stay put,&apos;&quot;&apos; but with the problem created by the war refugees who have arrived in or are on their way to Persia, Syria,Turkey and Egypt. Thus there are in Persia about 13,000 Polish civilians whoentered that country with the Polish soldiers from the Soviet Union, who arebeing temporarily accommodated; about 5,000 Greeks have arrived in Turkey andare being passed to Egypt via Syria; there are many hundreds of Greeks in cyprus, and these too have been passing to Syria.2. These abnormal additions of war refugees to the foreign population of countries in the sphere of military operations are embarrassing to our military&apos;effort, but they may also very well represent only the beginning of a movementwhich has really alarming potentialities. The Poles, for example, are very-anxious to pass out through Persia at least another 50,000 of their women andchildren who are stated to be starving in the Soviet Union; without meeting thePolish Government on this point it may prove impossible to obtain the three divisions of Polish soldiers which the Russians said they would be willing topermit to leave and whose services are urgently required by our MilitaryAuthorities. The number of Greeks who are capable of escaping to Turkey fromthe starvation conditions in the Greek islands runs to several thousands.Measures have, of course, been taken to prevent emigration from getting out of hand; the Polish Government have undertaken not to allow any of their people to get to Persia except in consultation with us, and an effort is being made,through supply of food to the Greek islands, to stop that particular exodusaltogether. But even if these refugee movements are slowed down or preventedaltogether we are still faced with accumulations which are serious enough, andit has been generally agreed that it is necessary on both military and political grounds that alternative destinations for all these people should be found.3. The difficulties of transport and accommodation are formidable. some progress has been made: the Government of India has agreed to receive athousand Polish children from Persia and the first 300 or so have arrived; theEast African Colonies and Northern Rhodesia have undertaken to receive a fewhundred Greek refugees, while Tanganyika and Uganda, after a conference atNairobi which the Chief Repatriation Officer at Cairo was sent to attend, haveagreed to accommodate 10,000 Polish civilians from Persia, spread over somemonths. The assistance in this matter of the United States, whose Ministry in cairo has been consulted by the Minister of State, and of the Belgian Government,m respect of the Congo, has been requested.11800   [24108]Copy No,/\ JWAR CABINET.
4. It is the Minister of State&apos;s view that the authorities in all the possibleareas of reception should have the problem presented to them with the utmosturgency and in terms of several thousands of refugees. His principal recom-mendations omitted India, no doubt because it is the military view that Polishadult refugees should not be sent there, but concentrate on the Union of SouthAfrica, East African Colonies with Northern and Southern Rhodesia, UnitedStates, Canada, Belgian and Portuguese Colonies and Madagascar. This last isclearly not an immediate possibility; and such investigation of the potentialitiesas may be set on foot would be purely provisional. As regards the other territories, however, the possibilities, given availability of shipping, are muchmore practicable, and I should be glad of the views of my colleagues on thefollowing recommendations : (a) That the South African Government (which agreed to receive 2,000 Greekrefugees but later withdrew this consent) should be requested to accommodate up to 50,000 refugees, chiefly women and children.(b) That the East African Colonies and Northern and Southern Rhodesiashould be asked to accept a total of 30,000 refugees; that is, thatwhile appreciation is expressed for the offer from Tanganyika and uganda to take up to 10,000 Polish refugees, the East AfricanGovernors should be requested to consider substantial additions tothis number over the next few months.(c) That the Dominion of Canada should be asked to share in the accommo-dation which, if the United States Governments response to therecommendations of their Minister in Cairo is favourable, would be accorded to refugees sent on returning United States ships.5. The problem as presented by the Minister of State is not so muchhumanitarian but military and political, and his apprehension is in no wayconnected with recent military developments in North Africa. Without theprospect of the reception of large numbers of Polish and Greek refugees in places where they will not be an embarrassment to our military effort it will beimpossible to plan the most convenient distribution of these people, but if theprinciple of accommodation is accepted, with the War Cabinets authority, onthe generous scale I have suggested, we shall be able to negotiate with greater freedom the necessary details, with the various Allied Governments and the reception authorities concerned.A. E.Foreign Office, July 14, 1942.
