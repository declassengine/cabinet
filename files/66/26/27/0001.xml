THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 297.July 18, 1942.WAR CABINET.THE NEED FOR A REVIEW OF THE MACHINERY OFGOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.IN view of the great extension of the field of Government action and the wide range of difficult problems which will call for solution through the agency of Government during the ten years which follow the conclusion of hostilities,it seems most desirable to institute an enquiry into the adequacy of our existing government machine to deal with the tasks ahead.2. It is now twenty-five years since the Haldane Committee on theMachinery of Government was appointed as a sub-committee of the Recon-struction Committee in July 1917. The Report of this Committee, which was published in 1918, was immediately recognised as being of outstanding quality and it has come to be regarded as a classical exposition of the problems withwhich it deals.3. Since the Haldane Committee reported there has been an enormousexpansion in the normal, as well as in the war-time, field of government activity.Many new problems have arisen. Many new Departments and public institutionshave been created. And the range of executive and administrative decisions,especially those affecting economic and social policy, has widened greatly. Thepresent war has in many ways acted as a forcing house of ideas and institutionsthe validity of which is unlikely to diminish with the end of hostilities. It seemsimportant, therefore, that the principles of the Haldane Committee should be reviewed in the light of twenty-five years&apos; experience and in the view of ouranticipations of post-war demands upon the machinery of democracy.4. The terms of reference of a new Committee on the Machinery of Govern-ment would require very careful consideration. I put forward the followingwording as a tentative suggestion :-&quot; To enquire into the responsibilities of the central Departments ofGovernment and of other central authorities engaged in the administrationof public services, and to advise on what changes in the existing machinery and management of executive government are needed to enable the Governmentto discharge its functions most efficiently in the years which follow the war.&quot;5. I therefore suggest that an enquiry along these lines should be instituted by a small number of Ministers (say three) under the Chairmanship of the lord president of the Council. These Ministers should be empowered to arrange forother persons whose experience would be valuable to them to be associated withthem in such parts of the enquiry as they may decide.The report would be made to the War Cabinet and would not necessarily bepublished.-   J R. S. C.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S. W. 1,July 18, 1942.[24107]
