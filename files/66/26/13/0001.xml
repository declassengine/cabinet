% A &apos;this document is the property of his britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECRET. Copy No.   ****W.P. (42) 283.July 6, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON MISSION TO INDIA.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.I THINK it is desirable for purposes of official record and for theassistance of any similar Mission to India in future that I should provide a detailed account of the discussions which I had with Indian leaders during myrecent visit to India.The purpose of the Mission with which I was entrusted by the War cabinet was to ascertain,, by personal consultation with the leaders of Indian opinion,whether the conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government embodied in the draft declaration* would meet a sufficient measure of assent to enable it to be promulgated-gated with reasonable assurance that this would promote the solidarity of indian opinion and would result during the war in the co-operation of representativeIndian leaders in the existing machinery of government. Two separate butinter-connected issues were therefore involved firstly, the acceptability orotherwise of the basic principles and the procedure proposed for the framing of the post-war Indian Constitution, and, secondly, the manner in which theimmediate and effective participation of Indian leaders might be secured underthe existing machinery of government during the war and pending the introduction of a new Indian Constitution. It was the intention of the War Cabinetthat, if I succeeded in securing a sufficient general measure of assent in principle to the draft Declaration as a whole, the Governor-General should discuss with indian leaders the precise manner in which their immediate participation inthe existing forms of government should be given expression. In the event,however, Congress leaders were not prepared to commit themselves in regard tothe Declaration without assurances in regard to the immediate future. Froman early stage the discussions with them centred on paragraph (e), and, althoughopposition to individual provisions of the long-term proposals was expressed,it was upon this paragraph that the breakdown of the negotiations came.Preliminary Conversations.I left England by air on Saturday, the 14th March, and arrived in NewDelhi at midday on the 23rd March. I had arranged to spend the first two daysat the Viceroy&apos;s House and subsequently to move to a private residence, where i could hold my conversations with the Indian leaders in an unofficial atmosphere.At my request, the Viceroy had invited the three Presidency Governors and the governors of the North-West Frontier and United Provinces and the Punjabto meet me and, during my stay at the Viceroy&apos;s House, I had valuable conversa-tions with them and with the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief. I disclosed tothe Governors the text of the Declaration and, with the exception of the governor of the Punjab, who repeated to me his anxieties regarding their effect on the communal situation in the Punjab, which had already been reported to the WarCabinet by telegram, they were on the whole favourably inclined towards theproposals.* See Appendix, p. 18[24009] b
The Governor-General had strongly impressed upon me the desirability 0ftaking his Executive Council into confidence before I disclosed the terms of theDeclaration to the Party leaders. I therefore arranged to meet the ExecutiveCouncil for this purpose on the morning of Wednesday, the 25th March, onwhich day I had arranged to meet the Congress and Muslim League representa-tives in the afternoon. At this meeting Sir Eirozkhan Noon pointed out that owing to the weightage given to minorities in the Legislatures, in the Punjaband in Bengal, the Muslims, although the majority of the population, had not a statutory majority in the Legislatures and that, therefore, the provision in theDeclaration enabling Provinces not to adhere to a new Indian union would beof no value to the Muslims if the decisions were to be by vote of the Legislature.As it was clearly necessary to find some means of meeting this point, I decidedto suggest to the leaders of the different parties, as I saw them, that each Provinceshould reach its decision by a vote in the Legislative Assembly on a resolutionthat the Province should join the proposed Union, and that, failing a majorityof 60 per cent, in favour of this resolution, the minority should have the rightto demand a plebiscite of the adult male population. In spite of the obviousdisadvantages of the plebiscite proposal this appeared to be the only satisfactorymeans of securing that the wishes of the majority of the population should be effective. This proposition was not dissented from by any of the party leaderswhen put to them. But in their final resolution the Muslim League demandedthat the plebiscite be confined to the Muslim majority of the population only, andthe Sikhs and the Hindu Mahasabha also opposed this method of reaching adecision on this point.The Viceroy had also impressed upon me the importance of my giving earlyinformation about the proposals to Sir Sikander &quot;Hayat Khan, the PrimeMinister of the Punjab, in view of his important position in relation to the war effort. As I was anxious to preserve strictly the position that the discussions were primarily with the principal party organisations, I felt some difficulty about this in view of the strained relations known to exist between Sir SikanderHayat Khan and Mr. Jinnah. It was arranged, however, that Sir Sikandershould come to the Viceroy&apos;s House ostensibly to visit Sir Bertrand Glancy, andI was able to receive him privately and discuss confidentially the terms of theDeclaration with him before I saw any of the Indian leaders officially. SirSikander&apos;s reactions to the draft Declaration were favourable and he did notappear to anticipate any serious difficulties in the Punjab. I had, however,been warned by the Governor of the Punjab that Sir Sikander frequently revisedhis original opinions after a period of reflection.Selection of Indian Representatives.At the suggestion of the Governor-General I had agreed during my journey-to India that he should invite the principal political organisations to nominatetheir own representatives to hold discussions with me. Accordingly,, theCongress had nominated for this purpose Maulana Kalam Azad, their President,and Pandit JawaJharlal Nehru, and the Muslim League had nominatedMr. Jinnah as their sole representative. The Chamber of Princes and the HinduMahasabha had also been invited to nominate delegations, and after my arrival in India I issued similar invitations to the Europeans, the Indian christians and the Justice Party. In order to secure representation of other sections ofopinion, I invited certain individuals chosen in consultation with the Governor-General, to meet me. These included Dr. Ambedkar and Mr. Rajah, whom Isaw together as representatives of the Depressed Classes, Sir Henry Gidney for Anglo-Indians, and Mr. Joshi as a representative of Labour. In the case of theSikhs, I dealt primarily with the delegation nominated by the Sikh All-PartiesConference, but since this delegation was not representative of some elements of Sikh opinion, I saw separately Sirdar Kirpal Singh, at the suggestion of theGovernor of the Punjab, and later, at the suggestion of Sir Sikander HayatKhan, Sirdar Dasaundha Singh and Captain Naunihal Singh.With the object of broadening the scope of my contacts and of hearingprovincial points of view without opening the door to all and sundry, I invited the Premiers of Provincial Governments aifd the ex-Premiers of the Provincesnow administered under Section 93 to come and see me. Not all of these were able to accept, but I had valuable discussions with Mr. Rajagopalachari and
Sir Sikander Hayat Khan, with whom, as I was dealing primarily with party organisations, I should otherwise have found it difficult to renew contact. I alsosaw Mr. Fazlul Huq, Premier of Bengal, and the Rajah of Parlakimedi, Premierof Orissa, Pandit Pant, Mr. Kher, Sir Muhammad Saadullah and KhanBahadur Allah Baksh, ex-Premiers of the United Provinces, Bombay, Assamand Sind, respectively, and Mr. Shukla, ex-Premier of the Central Provinces.I also invited Mr. Gandhi to come to Delhi to meet me, a step which wassuggested to me by Lord Linlithgow. I should, in any case, have felt it essentialto success, and was glad that the Viceroy felt no difficulty about it. In addition,I invited Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar to see me together, and at alate stage in the negotiations I received representatives of the National LiberalFederation and of the Andhras.Although in the later stages of the negotiations I interviewed a number ofother people, including Mr. M. N. Roy and Mr. Jamnadas Mehta andMr. Mohammed Yusafar, a Communist, recommended to me by Mr. Joshi, thosenamed above were all that I felt it necessary to consult as representative leadersof Indian opinion. So far as I am aware, no serious criticism of this selectionwas raised in any quarter. Naturally, I was pressed -to receive other interests,such as the Momins, landlords, and various rival organisations claiming torepresent the Depressed Classes, but I excused myself on the ground of lack oftime. I expressed my desire at an early Press Conference to meet representativewomen and young people. As a result, I saw a delegation of the All-IndiaStudents&apos; Federation. I heard subsequently that the Congress women&apos;s organi-sation had desired to come, but had been prevented from doing so by the congress party. I found it necessary to receive a separate delegation from HyderabadState, but otherwise I refused to receive representatives of individual States and dealt exclusively with the Chamber delegation, though I met informally theMaharajahs of Indore and Gwalior.During the last week of my stay, when the pressure of interviews had some-what relaxed, I saw all the members of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Councilindividually.Discussions with the Indian Leaders.At midday on Wednesday, the 25th March, I moved with my staff to 3 QueenVictoria Road, and immediately began consultations with the Indian leaders.During the opening days of these conversations, the text of the draftDeclarations was kept secret. It was clear to me that it would be most difficultto maintain this position for long owing to the pitch of public expectations atthe time of my arrival, which increased daily when the conversations started.In order to prevent leakage of the text after it had been disclosed to the indian representatives, I had had prepared a number of versions of the text whichdiffered in minor points of wording, and I let it be known that the texts givento different interests were not identical, so that, if there were any leakage, I shouldbe able to identify its source. This device was most successful in preventingleakages of the actual text, but it did not prevent the general sense of the document from reaching the Press. There was, in fact, a considerable leakageimmediately after the text had been read to the Executive Council. It was evident, however, that it could not be expected that secrecy could be maintainedindefinitely, and I felt that there might well be possibilities of securing public support for the proposals if publication were made. With the concurrence ofthe War Cabinet I therefore arranged for publication on the morning of Monday,the 30th March. There is, however, no doubt in my mind that considerable advantages were gained by disclosing the document to the party leaders before it was made public. It gave me the opportunity of making minor alterations inthe text to meet the views of individual leaders, and, as will appear, two suchalterations were in fact made. It also released the Indian Party leaders from thenecessity of making immediate press announcements of their reactions to thestatement before they had heard my explanation of it and had had time forreflection and consultation with their friends. As soon as the text was publishedthe minority representatives began to put out critical statements containing theirviews on the Declaration, and were no doubt impelled to do so to forestallcriticism from their followers.Before publication I had communicated the text confidentially to the repre-sentatives of all the main Indian interests with the exception of the Depressed[24009] b 2
Classes, the Indian Christians and the Justice Party, who, owing to their inability to arrive in Delhi in time, were unable to see me until the day on which the document appeared in the press.. I think it will make for clarity if I describe separately my discussions with each of the main parties or interests and their final attitude to the proposals,although, in fact, I dealt with them concurrently. Owing to the waiting attitude adopted by the Muslim League, the conversations with Congress were the crucialfactor throughout the discussions, and I have little doubt myself that, had the outcome of these been different, the final attitude of the Muslim League and theother minorities would have been considerably affected, if not entirely reversed.(a) The Congress.On the afternoon of the 25th March I received Maulana Kalam Azad withhis secretary, Mr. Asaf Ali, acting as interpreter, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehrubeing unable to come to Delhi owing to ill-health. At this meeting I gave theMaulana a text of the Declaration and offered to expound any points on whichhe desired explanation. He immediately raised the issue of the control of defenceunder an interim Government under paragraph (e) of the Declaration. He saidthat the Congress view was that it was necessary, in order to mobilise effectivelythe full force of the Indian people, to give them control of the defence of theircountry. I gave him a detailed explanation of the reasons why it was essential forthe efficient conduct of the war that the strategic and operational control should remain the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government acting through theCommander-in-Chief, and pointed out that we were offering to India represen-tation in the War Cabinet to enable her voice to be heard in the decisions madethere. The Maulana argued that, whatever might be necessary in the sphere of strategic control, some gesture, such as the transfer of the Defence Departmentto an Indian Member, was essential to enable the support of the Indian people tobe fully mobilised. The interview was extremely friendly and the Maulanapromised to see me again after consulting the Working Committee which was coming to Delhi.On the 27th March I had a 2^ hours&apos; interview with Mr. Gandhi, who had come to Delhi at my request to meet me. Throughout the conversation headopted a discouraging attitude, although he spoke entirely in friendly terms.Having explained to me that, of course, he was not now officially connected with congress, he expressed the definite view that Congress would not accept theDeclaration, owing, firstly, to the provisions regarding Indian States, and,secondly, those dealing with accession or non-accession of Provinces. He also(although more vaguely) questioned the retention of defence in British handsduring the interim period. So far as the States were concerned, he argued that congress could not tolerate the continued existence of autocratic States under the aegis of the British Government with the right to call upon the armed forces of britain to enforce the power of their Rulers. I pointed out that the first basis for any reform in States administration was the setting up of an independentBritish India, the influence of which would inevitably set up a movement ofdemocratisation in the States, and said that I was certain that under a Constitu-tion of the kind envisaged it would be the object of British policy toencourage a greater amount of democratic government in the States. I asked him what his positive proposals in regard to the States were, and he said he was against any idea of compelling them into an Indian Union, but would like to seethem converted into independent States with no reliance on British authority, as this would accelerate the movement for transfer of power to the States&apos; peoples.He did not wish to see the Rulers disappear immediately, but wished them to convert their States into constitutional democracies, the smaller ones beingabsorbed in the larger, or in the Indian Union. After a lengthy argument on thissubject, I thought that he seemed inclined to moderate his view of the document on this point.As regards the right of non-accession, he started by asserting that the document was an invitation to the Muslims to insist on the creation of a Pakistan.He acknowledged the great influence of Jinnah and admitted that the pakistan movement had grown greatly in strength, but he remained firmlyopposed to the division of India. I pointed out to him that the document was primarily based on the conception of a united India, and that it was only if
onoress failed to come to an agreement with the Muslims in the constitution-taking body that the danger of non-accession would arise. I said that I hadlways understood him to take the view that, if the British Government stoodside there would be no difficulty in reaching such an agreement, and stressedv belief that such an agreement was more likely if the Muslim Provinces had he option of not coming into a Constitution framed by a constituent Assembly.At the conclusion of our discussion Mr. Gandhi pressed me most earnestly,ot to publish the document. I told him that it was intended to publish it on the&quot;following Monday, and he urged me many times not to do so. He asked me whatrinnah&apos;s attitude to publication was, and I told him that Jinnah was in favourf publication before long owing to the risk of leakage. He interpreted this (ashad myself) as being an indication that Jinnah would accept the scheme. Iather formed the view that he was afraid of the pressure of public opinion ononoress to accept the scheme, which would to some extent deprive them of the ability to bargain in regard to it.On the 28th March I had an interview with Mr. Rajagopalachari, who cameo see me as the late Premier of Madras.  As he was not acting as a representa-ive of Congress, he was not prepared to discuss points of detail, but he stressedhree points which he thought were likely to prejudice the chances of success with the Congress:  firstly, the use of the word &apos;&apos; Dominion&apos;&apos;  in the openingjaragraph, for which he would like to see substituted &apos;&apos; free Member State &apos;&apos;;;econdly, the right of non-accession, which, however, he did not stress strongly;Jknd, thirdly, the question of defence.  Here he used the same arguments as Azad,laying that it was essential that the Indian leaders should be able to give someiarion call to their people which would stimulate them from their presentHefeatist attitude.  He argued that something should be done to improve the last paragraph of the document to this end, and was of opinion that the chances ofuccess would be much increased if it were made to read as follows : &quot; During the critical period which now faces India, the peoples ofIndia must take upon themselves the defence of their own country and thetask of organising this defence must fall upon the Government of India;yet His Majesty&apos;s Government must inevitably bear the full responsibilityfor the successful prosecution of the war in India both for historical reasons and by virtue of the world-wide nature of the war. They desire and invite, &amp;c.....&quot;f On the same day I saw Maulana Azad again and went over with him once more-&quot;the whole ground regarding the defence question.It was now evident that the question of defence would become the crucialIssue, and on the evening of the 28th March I consulted the Viceroy regardingthe possibility of an amendment of paragraph (e) of the Declaration in theTrection suggested by Rajagopalachari.  As a result we agreed upon the formulahich, with the approval of the War Cabinet, was included in the final text of theraft Declaration when the document was published on the following MondayIfnorning. This definitely stated that the task of organising to the full the military,Moral and material resources of India must be the responsibility of the Govern-Jnent of India with the co-operation of the peoples of India, while His Majesty&apos;sgovernment must retain control and direction of the defence of India.   A copyi the revised paragraph (e) was sent to the leaders of all the delegations to whom had given copies of the document itself, before the revised text was published.On the morning of the 29th March I invited Pandit Nehru, who hadRust arrived in Delhi, to come to breakfast with me and subsequently I wentIpith him to call on Mr. Gandhi at Birla House. Nothing except courtesies passedetween myself and Mr. Gandhi, but, at his suggestion, I had a conversation withandit Pant and Mr. Kher, which lasted for an hour and a half.   These two^rgued on the same lines as the other Congress representatives whom I had seen,Pandit Pant being particularly strong against the non-accession provisions as] j^ing an incitement to Pakistan.   After referring to the Indian States question,Ifh. Kher raised the defence issue.   I again went over the arguments as regardshe necessity for the unified control of operations and I think that I producedome impression on them, although they remained unconvinced that control ofP-rattan, by the War Cabinet was inconsistent with the transfer of the Defenceember&apos;s portfolio to an Indian.
Discussions regarding the Defence Formula.It was clear to me from all these conversations and from other sources ofinformation that, unless we could go some way to meet the Congress view on thedefence question, there was little prospect of success. The reception of the draft declaration by the Indian Press had been on the whole favourable, and I decidedto seek some means of compromise on the defence issue. On the 30th March i therefore wrote to the Congress President and to Mr. Jinnah the letter which is reproduced as No. 1 in the White Paper (Command 6350). The terms of this letter were agreed between myself and the Viceroy. The letter made it clear thatwhile the division of responsibility between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of India would be as slated in paragraph (e) of the Declaration, &quot;theViceroy would be prepared to consult with Indian leaders on this basis to see whether it were possible to designate an Indian to some office connected with theGovernment of India&apos;s defence responsibilities, without in any way impinginoupon the functions and duties of the Commander-in-Chief, either in his capacity as supreme Commander of the armed forces in India, or as the Member of theExecutive Council in charge of defence.&quot;On the 1st April I received further reliable information that the Congressintended to reject the proposals mainly on the defence issue, and I was privatelyinformed that they had already drafted a resolution in this sense. I thereforeinvited Maulana Azad and Pandit Nehru to meet the Commander-in-Chief inorder that they might receive from him in person an explanation of the difficultie;in the way of the transfer of the Defence Portfolio. I hoped that the personal opinion of the Commander-in-Chief would carry weight, and also that personalcontact with General Wavell would have the effect of increasing the Congres:leaders&apos; confidence in his personal collaboration on any interim Executive oiwhich they might agree to serve. The invitation was accepted, but on the samafternoon they came to see me and handed me the text of the Congress ResolutionThey said, however, that the Resolution would not be published at present amgave me to understand that, if they could be satisfied in regard to defence, thremainder of the Resolution might be subject to substantial modification.The interview between the Congress leaders and General Wavell took placon the evening of the 3rd April, but, although they called on me immediatelafterwards, I could form no estimate of the impression which had been produceupon them.   But however this might be, I felt that we should be wrong to lithe negotiations break down on the defence question without making everendeavour to reach a compromise.   I therefore despatched on the evening othe 4th April a telegram reviewing the general position and the possiblalternative courses of action, as a result of which I was authorised by theCabinet to offer the creation of a new portfolio connected with defence whitcould be held by an Indian Member of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive, anwhich would take over such functions of the existing Defence Department as ilViceroy and the Commander-in-Chief considered could be transferred withoimpairing the position of the latter.   Accordingly, on the 7th April, I wroteMaulana Azad and Mr. Jinnah a letter (No. 7 in the White Paper) whi(proposed that the Commander-in-Chief should remain a Member of the ExecutiCouncil, but should be entitled &quot; War Member.&quot;  In this capacity he would retsfull control over all the war activities of the armed forces in India.   A niportfolio, which could be held by a representative Indian, would be created, whiwould take over those sections of the Defence Department which couldseparated immediately from the War Department, and, in addition, the DefeiCo-ordination Department and other important functions directly relateddefence, such as economic warfare and denial policy.   The new member wouldentitled &quot; Defence Co-ordination Member.&quot;It was at this point that Colonel Louis Johnson, President Rooseve!personal representative on supply matters, who had just arrived in India Jparticipated in the conversations. From the outset he assured me that he&apos;giving his good offices as a go-between and was not in any way seeking to inter?as a representative of the President or of the U.S.A. He was, however, abfeforcible expression of his personal opinion that, if Congress broke oft&apos;conversations on the defence issue, they would forfeit all public support in&quot;U.S.A., to produce no small effect upon the minds of the Congress leaders.M
Colonel Johnson had, with the approval of the Viceroy, already had twoconversations with Pandit Nehru, at the latter&apos;s request. As a result of these,he came on the evening of the 7th April to tell me that he understood that theoffer we had made would be more acceptable to Congress if it purported at least to transfer the Defence Department to Indian hands, even though this were accompanied by the transfer to the Commander-in-Chief, as War Member, ofthose functions of the Defence Department which we held it necessary for theCommander-in-Chief to retain. After personal discussion between myself,Colonel Johnson and the Viceroy, the latter agreed to consider a formula on this basis. I then drafted a formula and showed it to the Viceroy, who simul-taneously produced a much longer draft of his own. The upshot was that a formula in the following terms was agreed with the Viceroy: &quot; In amplification of the Clause (e) of the draft Declaration, HisMajesty&apos;s Government make the following proposition upon the subject matter of the defence of India :- (a) The Defence Department shall be placed in charge of a representativeIndian member with the exception of functions to be exercised bythe Commander-in-Chief as War Member of the Executive Council.(p) A War Department will be constituted which will take over such functions of the Defence Department as are not retained by theDefence Member. A list of all the retained functions has beenagreed, to which will be added further important responsibilities,including the matters now dealt with by the Defence Co-ordinationDepartment and other vital matters related to the defence of India.&quot;The list of retained functions was the same as that already communicatedtthe Congress leaders in my letter of the 7th April, as being the functions ofe Defence Department which could be transferred to an Indian Member.This draft formula was handed to the Congress leaders by Colonel Johnsonany on the 8th April as one which, he understood, might be acceptable. On thevening of the 8th April Colonel Johnson came to see me again after a further^mversation with Pandit Nehru. He said that he now understood that theirmula would be more acceptable if, instead of defining the functions of theefence Department to be retained by the Indian Defence Member, it definedKie functions which the War Member would take over from the Defence Depart-ent.   This was, of course, only a change of form, the subject matter to be-tained by an Indian Defence Member being the same as before.    Colonelhnson and I then drafted a formula in the following terms : &quot; (a) The Defence Department shall be placed in the charge of a repre-sentative Indian Member, but certain functions relating to theconduct of the war will be exercised, until the new constitutioncomes into operation, by the Commander-in-Chief, who will be in control of the war activities of the armed forces in India and whowill be a Member of the Executive Council for that purpose.(6) A War Department will be constituted under the Commander-in-ChiefThis Department will take over such functions as are to be exercised by the Commander-in-Chief. A list of such functions has beenprepared and is attached.(c) The Defence Member shall be in charge of all other matters relating to defence in the Defence Department and those now dealt with by theDefence Co-ordination Department, in addition to other important matters closely related to defence.(d) In the event of any new functions falling to be discharged in relationto defence or any dispute arising as to the allocation of any oldfunctions, it shall be decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;List of War Department&apos;s Functions.&quot; The War Department, for which the Commander-in-Chief will be Member,W be responsible for the governmental relations of G.H.Q., N.H.Q., andjp-Q., which include : .(1) Examining  and sanctioning of proposals emanating  from G.H.Q.N.H.Q., and A.H.Q.
(2) Representing the policy of Government on all questions connected withthe war which originate in or concern G.H.Q., N.H.Q., or A.H.Q.(3) Acting as the channel of communication between the Government ofIndia and His Majesty&apos;s Government on all such questions.(4) Acting as liaison between these headquarters and the other departments of Government and Provincial Governments.&quot;The definition of the War Member&apos;s functions in this formula was taken from the Vice.roy&apos;s own draft, which had not been adopted when the first formulawas framed. Mr. Hodson, the Reforms Commissioner of the Government ofIndia, who was present when I saw Colonel Johnson, was asked to take copiesof the new formula to the Commander-in-Chief and the Viceroy, and ColonelJohnson went to communicate the revised version to the Congress leaders, againnot as a final offer, but as a formula which he understood might be acceptable!I did not consult the Viceroy before taking this step, as unless action was taken at once it was probable that the Congress would finally reject the proposals andthe formula included his own definition of the War Member&apos;s functions.Subsequently, the Viceroy asked me to make some alterations in the wording ofthis formula, and I was able when I saw the Congress leaders to secure these amendments without difficulty. The Congress leaders, however, asked for the omission of the words &quot; until a new constitution comes into operation,&quot; to whichI agreed. The final form of the formula which I understood to be acceptable tothe Congress leaders is published as No. 8 in the White Paper (Command 6350).The Congress Working Committee met to consider this formula on the morning of Thursday, the 9th April. An atmosphere of tense expectation pre-prevailed in Delhi at this time, and there is no doubt that there was very general public anticipation of an agreement. At lunch time on that day it was reportedthrough press channels that Mr. Rajagopalachari had said on leaving theCongress meeting that agreement was now certain.Consequently it was with some hope that I received. Maulana Azad and.Pandit Nehru at their request at 5.30 that afternoon. So far as defence was concerned, this hope appeared to be justified. The Congress leaders accepted theViceroy&apos;s amendments and raised no objection to the formula as so revised. Butit may be that the Congress leaders at this stage had determined not to reach agreement and did not dispute the proposed formula regarding defence becausethey had decided to break on other issues. In any event they turned, the conversation to the wider question of the general position of the Executive Council,and the Viceroy&apos;s powers under the proposed interim arrangements. At earlierinterviews this question had come up in a general way and we had discussed it from various aspects. I had, however, uniformly taken the view that this was amatter which I could not settle with them. I had stated that I was sure theywould be able to come to some agreement with the Viceroy, but that it was forthe Viceroy and not for myself to decide the actual terms upon which the new government would, be carried on.I stated that I was sure the Viceroy had in mind if representative Indianswere on his executive to treat it more as a cabinet than as an executive council.At this final interview, however, the Congress representatives brought up thesubject as a bar to further progress towards agreement and stated that they couldnot agree to the other matters unless I could then and there give them the assurances they asked for. I pressed them to accept the declaration provisionallywith any comments or reservations they wished to make, so that talks with theViceroy could be started on the implementation of paragraph (e).I pointed out that this could not bind them to accept any conditions laid downby the Viceroy, as it would always be open to them to refuse to enter the Executive,just as a person offered, a place in the British Cabinet could refuse if the PrimeMinisters conditions were not acceptable. I further pointed out that if as I understood they feared that the Viceroy might prove too difficult to work within practice, which I considered most unlikely, they would always have the powerto resign, which would put them in a strong position to press their point of view.The demand, which they made was that the Viceroy should undertake toaccept the majority decision of the Executive Council and should not do morethan act as a constitutional monarch. I pointed out that this was not possible but that the degree of compromise towards such a position could only
determined if they would, discuss it with the Viceroy on the basis of their general acceptance of the rest of the declaration.It seemed to me clear from the course of our conversation that they had comedetermined to find a reason for refusal and that, having discarded the earlierobiections as valid causes, they had been driven to find this new reason.&quot; On the following afternoon I received Maulana Azad.&apos;s letter (No. 9 in theWhite Paper) which, with my reply and Maulana Azad&apos;s rejoinder, closed thenegotiations with the Congress.D I think it is quite clear that the Congress decision to reject the proposals was a last minute change of front. I base this opinion not only on the reportedstatement of Rajagopalachari at midday on the 9th April, but also on a telephoneconversation which I had with Mr. J. C. Gupta on the morning of the 10th April.Mr. Gupta was then in Calcutta,&apos; but had been in Delhi and had played a valuable part as a go-between between myself and the Congress leaders. Hetelephoned to congratulate me on the decision of Congress to accept the scheme.He had evidently been informed that the Working Committee had come to such&apos;a decision on the previous day, but had not heard of the later developments as aresult of my conversation with the Congress leaders the preceding day. As heis one of Azad&apos;s closest friends I was certain he had been given this informationby Azad himself; in fact, he so implied, in the course of the conversation. Iattribute this change of front by the Congress to the personal intervention ofMr. Gandhi during the afternoon of Thursday, the 9th April.(b) The Muslim League.Mr. Jinnah was the sole official representative of the Muslim Leaguethroughout the conversations. I had my first interview with him on the25th March immediately after I had received the President of the Congress. Iopened the conversation by telling him that, while the views I had held about the muslim League&apos;s Pakistan policy two years ago were sincerely taken, I hadrevised them considerably during the past two years in view of the growingstrength of the support for the Pakistan policy of the League. Mr. Jinnahresponded very well to this, and the conversation thus began on an entirelyfriendly basis. I gave him a copy of the draft Declaration, and I think it rathersurprised him in the distance that it went to meet the Pakistan case. We hada long discussion as to the effect of the Declaration, especially as regards Bengaland Punjab. Mr. Jinnah was mainly interested in whether these Provinces wouldhave an effective right to opt out of the proposed Indian Union if they so wished,and I explained to him my proposal that there should be a vote of the Legislatureon a resolution to join the Union, and that, if there were a majority of less than60 per cent., the minority should have the right to challenge a plebiscite of theadult male population. Mr. Jinnah said that he thought a plebiscite was theonly fair idea, and that the only question was whether 40 per cent, was the rightfigure to apply to the minority. As regards paragraph (e), Mr. Jinnah did not seem to think there would be any insuperable difficulty provided the Viceroywould consult the Congress and himself on the composition of the ExecutiveCouncil, and would treat the Council as a Cabinet rather than as an Executiveaccording to the present constitution.The only substantial suggestion Mr. Jinnah made as regards any alteration in the document was that paragraph (c) (1) should make it clear that the status of the Provinces which did not accede would be in no way inferior to that of themain Union, and I was able to meet him on this point by an amendment beforethe document was published.After this meeting I saw Sir Sikander Hayat Khan, who told me that the muslim League Working Committee had accepted the scheme unanimously, andI am sure that this was true.I saw Mr. Jinnah again on the 28th March, when he came ostensibly forfurther elucidation of the document, but did not, in fact, ask an)&apos; questions whichhe had not asked before. It seemed clear from his attitude that the Muslimheague Working Committee had accepted the scheme in principle and wereprepared to proceed to settle the details, especially those under clause (e), withregard to which we had some general and rather vague conversation.After this interview Mr. Jinnah left Delhi to attend the Muslim LeagueConference,&apos; and he did not return until the closing stages of the conversations.1 had one further discussion with him before it was known that the Congress had[24009] c
rejected the proposals, though he then took the view that rejection was certainHe had asked me to let him know the Congress decision confidentially in advanceas he was anxious not to give the Muslim League decision till he was aware ofwhat Congress was going to do. He was obviously hard put to it to think outreasons for refusal. He was almost apologetic when he put forward thesuggestion in this conversation that the plebiscite on the question of accessionshould be confined to the Muslim population, as it was so obviously fantastic!The final resolution of the Muslim League which was eventually brought to m3by Mr. Jinnah was far more uncompromising than anything which he had saidto me in conversation. It takes exception both to the form of the constituentassembly proposed in the Declaration, and to my proposal that the question of accession should be decided by a 60 per cent, majority of the Legislature, failingwhich the minority might demand a plebiscite of the adult male population0On this point it demands that the plebiscite should be confined to the Muslimpopulation in order that they may have the right of self-determination.(c) The Indian States.In accordance with the Viceroy&apos;s advice, I dealt with the Indian Statesthrough a delegation nominated by the Chamber of Princes, but as a matter of form I received also a delegation from Hyderabad in order to conform with pastpractice.In the first instance I received on the 26th March the Chancellor of theChamber, H.H. the Jam Sahib, and the pro-Chancellor, H.H. the Maharajah ofBikaner. This was a short interview, at which I gave them a text of the draft declaration and a general explanation of its provisions. Subsequently I had two meetings with the full delegation, which, in addition to these twoMaharajahs, included the Maharajahs of Patiala and Bhopal and four Diwans.At these meetings a wide range of questions, many of them hypothetical,were raised. I assured the delegation in reply to specific enquiries that theStates would have not only the option of taking part in the constitution-makingbody, but, if they chose to take part, the option of refusing to adhere to theconstitution resulting from the deliberations of the constitution-making body;and, further, that if a State did. not adhere, its treaties with the Crown would remain unaffected save in such matters as railways, in which their presentrelations with British India might have to be revised in the new circumstances.I was asked whether the Governor-General and the Crown Representative would,in the new circumstances, be the same individual and replied that, so far as i could see, these offices would have to be held by different persons as the interests to be regarded by them would be quite distinct and sometimes antagonistic. if so, the Crown Representative might have to have his seat in one of the States.So far as the implementation of our obligations for the defence of the States was concerned, I said that the means by which this would be achieved would dependon the number and position of the States which did not adhere to the IndianUnion, but that there was no insuperable difficulty from the naval point of viewso long as we held Ceylon or, so long as we had aerodromes in some of the States,from the air point of view. We should have to make provision, in the treaty with the Indian Union, for any necessary facilities, such as passage of troops,which might be required to enable us to carry out this obligation. In general,we should stand by our treaties with the States unless they asked us to revokethem. So far as all matters of paramountcy were concerned,, if they wished theserelationships to be revised and for us to give up paramountcy, I indicated thatwe should be unlikely to take any objection.A point on which the delegation showed much interest was whether states which did not join the proposed Indian Union might form a separate Union underthe scheme, having the same status. I said that the scheme did not contemplatesuch a development, but only that the States could adhere or not to the IndianUnion. I added, however, that, if the scheme went through, I would submit thispoint to His Majesty&apos;s Government for consideration. It is clearly a point whichwill have to be considered in connection with any offer made in the future on thesame lines as these proposals, but its admission, while it might strengthen theposition of the States in the constitution-making body, would be likely to increasethe opposition of the Congress and of the Hindu Mahasabha to the proposals.I put it to the delegation that I understood that the scheme was generally satisfactory from their point of view and they replied that that was so.   The
delegation left with me a memorandum of points on which they desired writtenexplanations and in my replies to these I made, inter alia, the following main points : (1) The effect of adherence to the Indian Union upon a State&apos;s internalsovereignty and constitutional arrangements would depend entirelyupon the nature of the Union&apos;s constitution as framed by theconstitution-making body.(2) States which adhere will become part of the Union and the Crown will cease to exercise paramountey over them or to give them special protection, since the Crown clearly could not exercise such powers over a portion of the Union, which, as a whole, will enjoy dominion status. As regards the personal and dynastic affairs of a Ruler, these might by agreement with the Union remain subject to the jurisdiction of the Crown.(3) His Majesty&apos;s Government will make the necessary provision to implement their treaty obligations to non-adhering States not excluding thepossible use of force in the last resort.(4) Non-acceding States need have no fear that their treaties, so far as theseare concerned with their relations with the Crown, will be revisedwithout their own consent.(d) The Hindu Mahasabha.The Hindu Mahasabha delegation, led by Dr. Savarkar, expressed themselves as strongly opposed to the principle of non-accession. They asked whether theDeclaration must be accepted or rejected as a whole, as they were in favour of adeclaration on the lines of the first paragraph but opposed to non-accession. I told them that non-accession was fundamental, and gathered that on this basisthey would reject the proposals.As regards the defence question, they were strongly of the opinion that theDefence Portfolio should be put into Indian hands, but said that they could nottrust a Muslim Defence Minister, and would want two Defence Advisers, oneHindu and one Muslim, whose advice the Viceroy would undertake to accept.I pointed out that this was hardly practicable.The Resolution subsequently passed by the Hindu Mahasabha rejected theproposals on the grounds both that the right of non-accession and a constituentassembly based on the communal award were unacceptable. The MahasabhaResolution also emphasised the necessity for Indian control of Defence and the raising of Militias, their views on these matters being similar to those of theCongress.At the time when it appeared possible that the Congress might accept theproposals I became aware that they felt some anxiety lest, if they were to acceptthe proposals and co-operate in an interim government, they would be open toattack by the Hindu Mahasabha on the ground that they had sacrificed Hinduinterests to a dangerous degree. On the 9th April I therefore sent a telegram to dr. Savarkar through the Governor of Bombay, asking whether the Mahasabhawould be prepared to come into an interim government if the Congress and the muslim League were willing to do so. This telegram was in the following terms :  &quot; I am sorry that you have left New Delhi before the negotiationsterminated as I wanted to see you again before making an announcement onFriday morning. I expect to receive final answers from the Congress andMuslim League to-morrow and, if these are favourable, I shall have toadvise the Viceroy as to which parties are willing to come in on the basisof the document tor the formation of a new National Government&quot; undersection (e). If you are unable to appoint someone to see me on your behalf,will you please communicate your answer through the Governor of Bombayas to whether your party is prepared to come into a National Government onthe basis of the draft declaration, making such reservation as you deem fit.&quot;Dr. Savarkar&apos;s reply, was as follows: &quot; (1) If a National Government is to be formed for the period of thewar for carrying on the war effectively in the defence of India, then the hindu Mahasabha will have no hesitation in joining such a national government provided that: (a) this act does not bind the Mahasabha to[24009] c 2
accept every letter or clause of the Cripps scheme; and (b) that the rem^sentation of the Hindus in the National Government is more or [etproportionate to the strength of the Hindus in relation to that of tvMuslims. e&quot; (2) If a National Government is to be set up forthwith, then thePresident of the Hindu Mahasabha should be immediately informed as to how the seats will be apportioned, and how many representatives the HinduMahasabha will obtain. He wishes to be consulted about the choice ofmembers from the Hindu Mahasabha.&quot;In conversation with the Governor of Bombay Dr. Savarkar explained thatas regards the proportion of Hindus to Muslims in a National Government, hewould be prepared to regard representatives of the Sikhs and Depressed Classesas Hindus. He also said that he hoped that the declaration would be confined to the first and last paragraphs of the document, and that the Mahasabha andthe Sikhs would be prepared to abandon their anti-Pakistan campaign if theMuslims refrained from a pro-Pakistan campaign during the interim regime.As a result of this exchange of messages I was able to assure the Conoressthat the Mahasabha would come into the interim Government if the congress were willing to work the scheme.(e) The Sikhs.The main Sikh Delegation consisted of four members Sirdar Baldev Singh,Sirdar Ujjal Singh, Master Tara Singh and Sir Jogendra Singh, and wasnominated by the Sikh All Parties Committee.Their main interest seemed to be the possibility of having some redistribution-bution of Provincial boundaries in order to carve out a Province in which theSikhs would have a decisive voice as a large balancing party between the Hindusand Muslims. I pointed out to them the successive stages at which, under theprocedure proposed in the draft Declaration, they might reasonably hope to beable to exert pressure which would enable them either to bring the Punjab intothe main Indian Union, or to get some measure of autonomy within the secondUnion if one were &quot;formed.   These stages were (1) In the Constituent Assembly Congress would have at most only a smallmajority and would desire to get the minorities, such as the Sikhs,on their side by making the most ample provision for their protectionwithin the main Union. This would set a standard of minorityprotection which might well be satisfactory to the Sikhs, and might even entail the sub-division of the Punjab into two Provinces or the setting up within that Province of a semi-autonomous district forthe Sikhs on the Soviet model. If, however, the Sikhs did not getsatisfaction in this way, the British Government would be able to insist on minority protection clauses in the treaty, the terms of whichwould be a matter for negotiation.(2) If the Muslims were dissatisfied with the Constitution and wished the punjab to remain outside it, they would have to obtain a vote of non-accession by plebiscite, and would no doubt be anxious to increase their narrow population majority by securing the Sikh vote. Theywould therefore be likely to offer the most favourable minority pro-tection to the Sikhs to secure their support. There would then bethe second Constitution-making body in which the Sikhs could exerttheir influence, but there would also be a treaty between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the second Union in which we should be able to insist on minority protection clauses. I emphasised that, given theright of self-determination for India, there was no other means thantreaty protection by which we could give protection to the minorities.As regards the immediate future the Sikh delegation emphasised the needfor an Indian Member of the Executive to be in some way associated with defence, and wanted Sikh representation on the Executive. I told them thatthe latter was a matter for the Viceroy.On the 31st March I saAv the delegation again, when they said that theycould not approve the Declaration, as it did not give them sufficient protectionThey said that they would like a special Sikh area in which a vote could be take&apos;
as to whether, if there were more than one Union, the Sikhs should join themain Union or the Muslim Union.   I promised to bear this in mind.The delegation handed to me a letter and a memorandum giving a detailed statement of the Sikhs&apos; views. The full text of these documents is contained inthe White Paper and it is only necessary here to draw attention to three points.The first is their view that a plebiscite on the question of accession would lead to serious communal disturbances. The second is their claim for partition ofthe Punjab by the creation of a new Province consisting of the Ambala andJullundur divisions (which have a non-Muslim majority) together with theAmritsar, Gurdaspur and Lahore Districts (which have a halauced population).,This it is claimed would give a non-Muslim majority of 63 per cent, in the newProvince, while the Muslim majority in the remainder of the Province would be77 per cent. The third is the criticism of the proposal for Treaty protection onthe ground that the kind of protection desired, namely, political rights such as a fixed proportion of service appointments, a fixed proportion of representation inthe Central and Provincial Legislatures, and a maintenance of the Sikhs&apos;position in the Indian Army, can hardly be provided by means of a Treaty.(f) The Depressed Classes.I received Dr. Ambedkar and Mr. Rajah as representatives of the depressed classes on the 30th March. They pointed out that, under the present system of election of Depressed Class representatives to Provincial Legislatures imposed by the Poona Pact, the Depressed Classes would get very small representation in the Constituent Assembly, as most of their so-called representatives would beCongressmen. They asked me whether we considered the Depressed Classes tobe one of the racial and religious minorities, and I replied that we did. they then asked what kind of provisions were likely to be made in the Treaty for their protection. I said that these would be on the lines of the League of Nationsminority treaties, and that, if there were special provisions in the Constitution,these would probably be repeated in the Treaty, and that there would be someobligation to refer the matter to some outside authority in the event of a dispute,the Government of the Indian Union undertaking to abide by the decision sogiven. If the Indian Government failed to do so this would constitute a breach of treaty, and the British Government could take such steps as it considered wisein the particular circumstances. I said that, though this form of protectionmight seem to them inadequate, it was the only possible one, once granted theprinciple of self-determination for India.On the following day Dr. Ambedkar and Mr. Rajah wrote to me saying thatthe proposals were unacceptable to the Depressed Classes, as they would place them under an unmitigated system of Hindu rule, and would be resisted by themby all the means at their disposal. They requested me to convey their anxietiesto His Majesty&apos;s Government, and to impress upon them that the depressed classes would regard it as a breach of faith if a Constitution were forced upon them by His Majesty&apos;s Government which had not received their free and voluntary consent, and did not contain within itself the provisions necessary for safeguarding their interests.(g) The Europeans.I received a delegation of five representatives of the Europeans on two occasions. The delegation was led by Sir Henry Richardson. They were primarily interested in the protection of European interests, both during the transition period and under the permanent constitution of a new Indian Union.I explained that the whole spirit and intention of the draft Declaration wasthat we should give India complete freedom and self-government, includingfreedom to frame her own Constitution in her own way, and that the BritishGovernment had decided not to interfere with the form of the Constitution by insisting upon special rights for Europeans. I also told them that we had decided, as a matter of principle, that we would not demand safeguards for thecommercial interests of European British subjects in the main Treaty.  Suchatters would have to be dealt with in a separate trade or commercial agreement,the conclusion of which would not be a condition of implementing the new Consti-tution, but a normal trade agreement freely negotiated.  So far as possible, in suchegotiations, we should try to secure protection for British commercial interests.
The delegation enquired what would be the position of United KingdomBritish subjects who found themselves deprived of their livelihood in consequenceof the granting of self-government. I said that, in my opinion, there was noreason why such British subjects should not be allowed to continue to operate theirbusinesses&quot; in India under the new Constitution, but that, if as a direct result ofthe constitutional change individual British subjects found themselves deprived of their livelihood. I felt certain that the British Government would give due consideration to any claims they might put forward with a view to alleviating theposition of such persons. The delegates assured me of their desire to assist in-resolving the deadlock which prevented the co-operation of the mam parties inthe present Government, and their desire to help in mobilising Indian opinionbehind the war effort, the importance of doing which they fully appreciated. Theywere, however, insistent that the European community should be regarded as are recognised minority for the purpose of treaty protection under Clause (c) (ii) 0fthe draft Declaration. On. this point I informed them that, while EuropeanBritish subjects domiciled in India were clearly a racial minority, it would notbe possible under a Constitution framed as contemplated in the draft declaration to regard United Kingdom British subjects, who did not qualify as Indiancitizens under any legislation which might define such citizenship, as a racialminority for purposes of Treaty protection under Clause (c) (11). Before I leftIndia the delegation sent me a&apos; memorandum giving their views on this subject at some length. They argued that the Europeans, irrespective of domicile, had for years been regarded as one of the recognised political minorities, and, inparticular, had been so recognised for the purpose of representation in the Legis-Legislatures under the communal award. They therefore claim to be one of the minorities referred to by the Prime Minister in his speech in the House ofCommons on the 11th March, and entitled as such to Treaty protection on thesame lines as other minorities. They expressed their intention of pressing their claim to that position through their representatives both in India and in London,and contended that the recognition of this claim is in no way inconsistent with or damaging to the achievement of the general purpose of the draft Declaration.(h) The Anglo-Indians.I saw Sir Henry Gidney, as representative of the Anglo-Indian Community,on the 26th March. I explained to him that, as a very small numerical minority,the best that the Anglo-Indians could hope for, given that India was to have theright of self-determination, was that, with other minorities, they would receivereasonable safeguards from the majority in the Constituent Assembly. Sir Henryappeared to accept this position, but was anxious that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should render his community some special assistance, as they were likely,after the transfer of power, to be in a very difficult position, especially in regardto education. I told him that I could give no promise in regard to suchmatters, but that, if he put up some reasonable request, it would, I felt sure,receive consideration in view of the special position of his community.Subsequently Sir Henry Gidney sent me a considered statement of the viewsof the Anglo-Indians on the draft Declaration. This document, while acquiescing in the general purpose of the draft Declaration, expressed disagreement on thefollowing main points : -(1) The proposals for a Constituent Assembly are such that the Anglo-Indians, whose total membership in the Provincial LegislativeAssemblies is only 12 out of 1,585 seats, cannot under strict propor-tional representation expect any representation at all in theConstitution-making body.(2) While appreciating the reasons for including the right of non-accession,the Anglo-Indians feel that the position of smaller minorities, hithertostrengthened by the existence of a large Muslim minority, will be muchweakened by the partition of India and the exclusion of the bulk ofthe Muslims from the main Indian Union if this occurs.(3) They feel grave doubt as to the effectiveness of protection by means of aTreaty of the kind contemplated. If India has the right of secessionthey regard it as unlikely that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be
willing to quarrel with the Indian Government over the rights of asmall community, since this would increase the risk of India&apos;s secession.The history of the League of Nations does not promote confidence insuch minority protection.The community also ask that, in view of its special position and the responsibility which the British people owe to it, His Majesty&apos;s Government should, if theproposed policy is carried out, assist them specially in two ways : (a) By the grant of a substantial sum of money to enable the special needs&apos; of the community for European Christian education to be providedfor in an independent India.(b) By procuring for the community a substantial area of land to enable&apos; employment and means of livelihood to be provided for Anglo-Indianswho must inevitably expect to be displaced under an independentIndian Government from their present special position in government services.(i) The Indian Christians. &apos;A delegation nominated by the All-India Indian Christian Conference,consisting of Sir Maharaj Singh, Mr. F. X. DSouza and Mr. Rallia Ram, came to see me on the 30th March. I gave them a general explanation of the draft declaration, and they pointed out, as had the other lesser minorities, that theywould get very small representation in the constitution-making body. In replyto their enquiry whether they would be regarded as a religious minority, I repliedin the affirmative, and I gave them the same explanation as regards minorityprotection by the Treaty as I had given to the Depressed Classes representatives.Their general attitude was that, while there were points in the draft declaration with they could not easily agree with, they would not take any objection to it*as a whole.They asked whether they would be regarded as one of the minorities whomthe Viceroy was to consult regarding interim arrangements under paragraph (e).I said that this would be for the Viceroy to decide, but that I thought it unlikelythat they would be consulted.The delegation also raised the question of the control of defence and explained the reasons why we considered it essential to retain control of defenceduring the interim period.Indian Sttidents.These, together with the representative of the Communist Party whom I saw,were the most left-wring of all those whom I interviewed. They informed me thatthe Indian Students were split into two groups, the one to which they were attached, which was for an all-out war effort against Japan, and the other, strongespecially in Allahabad, which adopted the line of Mr. Gandhi. They were most anxious to do all they could to help in the Defence of India and I was able toput them in touch with the General Staff and the Government of India, whowere anxious to make use of their services. One of the matters of which theycomplained was that a number of their keenest propagandists and leaders werein detention owing to their left-wing views. I arranged with the Viceroy before i left for the liberation of a great number of them so that they might play theiractive part in forwarding the war effort.Indian Labour.I saw Mr. Joshi and Mr. M. N. Roy as representatives of Indian Labour.The former was whole-hearted in his support of the declaration. The latter wasvery impatient with the attitude of Congress and seemed to think that the realsolution of the Indian problem was to hand over to him the Government of India,in association with the Viceroy.I have always regarded Mr. Roy as an unreliable and self-seeking politicianand I do not think that he has any real influence in India.Indian Liberals.Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar came to see me twice and putforward ideas which Sir Tej had publicised before my arrival. Their subsequentcommunications to the press disclose their attitude.  They were both most anxious
for a settlement and were very insistent upon the necessity of placing the DefencePortfolio in the hands of an Indian. They did their best to get accommodationwith Congress and to help towards a settlement. The actual body of opinion which they represent is small, but Sir Tej has a personal influence and followingwhich is of value.The Press.From the time of my arrival in India I was careful to adopt as frank and friendly an attitude as possible towards the Indian Press. I held a press conference on the day of my arrival, at which I undertook to hold furtherConferences every other morning during my stay, and at all these ConferencesI answered questions. Indian journalists are a formidable audience, but theyresponded extremely well to frank treatment, The main Press Conference washeld on Sunday evening, the 29th March, when I disclosed the text of the draft declaration in preparation for its publication next morning, and was questionedon it for 2 hours. This enabled me to emphasise publicly the great advance overprevious proposals which the Declaration embodied, and undoubtedly secured for it a much more favourable reception in the Press generally than it would otherwise have received. The Press generally maintained a responsible and hopeful attitudetowards the proposals until the closing stages of the conversations, when it began to concentrate on the Defence issue and sought to suggest differences of view between the Viceroy, the Commander-in-Chief, and myself. I am sure, however,that the policy of treating the Indian Press with candour, as is now generallydone in this country, proved itself to be fully justified, and made possible a directappeal to the forces of public opinion in India.Conclusion.In retrospect, I do not find it easy to assess with precision either the causes which led to the failure to secure agreement or the width of the gap which laybetween the failure and success. From the outset there were powerful influencesworking against a settlement, the most powerful of which was Mr. Gandhi. Thedecline in confidence in our prospects of victory due to the Japanese successes inthe Far East, and especially our defeats in Malaya and Burma, had also aconsiderable effect. There- is no doubt that there was a wide-spread feeling,especially among Hindus, that if the Japanese were to be victorious it might bebetter for Indian interests if Indian politicians had taken no overt part inIndia&apos;s defence, and also, especially in Hindu business circles, a feeling that theprocess of defending India on a national basis would involve disproportionatelygreat material and financial losses which would not be offset by any political gain.On the other hand, there were powerful elements in favour of all-out resistance,which included some of the principal Congress Leaders such as Nehru as wellas the Muslims and Sikhs and. much Middle and Lef t-Wing opinion. I have nodoubt at all that Maulana Azad and Nehru, in addition to Rajagopalachari andBhulabhai Desai were anxious to find a basis on which Congress could join in thedefence of India, and would,, if agreement had been reached, have co-operatedto this end with complete loyalty. But throughout the negotiations Mr. Gandhiexerted his influence against any agreement. His motives are always difficult todiscern, but his non-violent doctrine alone made his opposition natural. Thiswould induce him to any course of action which would prevent Congress from being drawn into the active organisation of India for its own defence by violentmeans. Another factor of importance was Mr. Gandhi&apos;s appreciation of the challenge of his own position. Had agreement been reached he must have beensuperseded in his leadership of Congress by Nehru or some other supporter of violent resistance, and he may well have foreseen that in such circumstances itwould have been extremely difficult for him to stage a come-back. He was, there-fore, I think, determined to fight against agreement at all cost. In any event,Mr. Gandhi&apos;s followers in the Working Committee consistently opposed agreement and it is probably not without significance that on the afternoon of Thursday,the 9th April, on the morning of which day the Working Committee were reported to have decided, to accept the proposed basis of agreement on defence,a telephone conversation between the Congress Leaders in Delhi and Mr. Gandhiat Wardha lasting 2 hours was reported by the Government of India to have
taken place, after which there was a complete change in the Congress attitude.It is reported that before this conversation the voting in the Working Committeehad been 7 to 5 in favour of acceptance and that after it became  8 to 4I against.0 It is alleged by the Congress leaders that they were misled as to the positionawarding the Executive Council under paragraph (e) and had not understoodthat the Viceroy would retain all his statutory powers of overruling the Council.I am confident that what I said to the Congress representatives did not bear theinterpretation which they placed upon it, and my belief is that there was no realmisunderstanding but that, having decided to break off the conversations, theCongress chose this point as a better ground on which to do so than the defencequestion.The tactics of the Muslim League and Mr. Jinnah&apos;s own attitude, togetherwith Sir Sikander Hyat Khan&apos;s statement that the League had passed aresolution accepting the proposals, conclusively show, I consider, that the Leaguewould have been read)7 to accept the proposals if Congress had been prepared todo so. The Sikhs, the Hindu Mahasabha, the Depressed Classes and the Anglo-Indians all expressed strong opposition to the long-term proposals, though not onthe same grounds. While none of the minorities are prepared openly to oppose the claim for Indian self-determination, and all of them professedly support that demand, they are none of them ready to abandon the idea that the British Govern-ment should in some way interfere in the process of making the constitution of a free India to secure provisions in the constitution for their protection. I hope that my conversations have helped to bring them face to face with the inconsistencyof their position, and to a recognition that it is only by Treaty protectionthat we can, once granted the right of self-determination for India, secureminority rights. It must, however, be admitted that even had the congress and the Muslim League been prepared to accept the scheme it would havebeen difficult to say that the other minorities which had already expressedopposition were ill agreement with the scheme as a whole. But all ofthem would, I think, have been willing to co-operate in interim arrangements under paragraph (e) if it had been possible, with the co-operation of congress and the League, to proceed with the policy proposed in the draft Declaration.Their attitude, however, is to my mind conclusive evidence that if agreement byall of these minorities is made a condition of accepting a constitution framed by indians no such constitution will ever be acceptable and the road of progress is indefinitely closed.The correct attitude to adopt in these circumstances is, in my opinion, thatall we ask is the co-operation in the immediate Government upon the basis of themain part of the declaration. That is to say, that we have no objection to reserva-tions or criticism of particular provisions of the long-term proposals, provided it is accepted that we propose to proceed upon that basis, failing any agreementbetween the principal parties and communities in India upon some other alternative. If, accepting that basis, the parties were then prepared toco-operate with us in the immediate Government of India, we should have taken a very real step forward, and should have substantially overcome the deadlock.The fact that the various sections of Indian opinion then worked together on theimmediate problems would provide the best possible basis for an ultimatesatisfactory solution of the whole matter.I feel that, as a result of my visit, India has itself been made to face thepractical problem of self-government in a way that it has never had to face it before, and that, although there must be a period of great confusion of thought and difficulty as a result, this is a necessary stage through which we must pass.When the matter comes to be considered again this period of thought will, Ibelieve, help in making a solution more possible.(Initialled) E.
