THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 317.July 27, 1942.TO BE JKEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken &apos;.oensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES TO RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE War Cabinet will, be aware of the decision reached at the meetingof the Defence Committee (Operations) held on 13th July(i) that in the presentcircumstances the risks involved in sailing convoys to North Russian ports were so great that it would be unjustifiable to continue to do so. The concurrence of the United States Government was accordingly obtained to the diversion tothe Persian Gulf route of the next shipments of supplies to be provided underthe Second Protocol offer.2. Discussions between the Minister of War Transport and Mr. Harrimanhave resulted in agreement between the Combined Shipping Adjustment boards in London and Washington to recommend the adoption by the two Governmentsof the following principles : (a) Nothing should be shipped from the United Kingdom to the persian gulf for Russia that is capable of being produced in and shipped from the United States.In the application of this principle exceptions would be made only in respectof goods unobtainable from United States sources, or goods urgently requiredwhich cannot immediately be delivered in sufficient quantities from north america.&apos;(&amp;) Other supplies should be sent from the United Kingdom as and whenthe Northern route is reopened.3. These proposals are open to objection on political grounds because theimpression might be created that His Majesty&apos;s Government, who had found itimpossible to continue supplies by the Northern route, were further evading theirobligation to supply the U.S.S.R. by leaving it to the Americans to send suppliesvia the Persian Gulf. -4. After consideration of the matter at a meeting of the Allied SuppliesExecutive on the 24th July,(2) at which Mr. Harriman was present, I have reachedthe conclusion that the political objections, although substantial, are outweighed by the evident advantages of the plan proposed by the shipping authorities,because material shipped from North America to the Persian Gulf would reachRussia as quickly as supplies despatched from this country at the same time.It would be an obviously wasteful use of shipping tonnage to export from theC) D.O.

United Kingdom gbMs\bohtaihihg&apos; materials imported from North America.Further, much more economical loading can be secured in the United States, wherefoodstuffs and raw materials are available for deadweight.5. Moreover, the despatch by the Southern route of supplies against theBritish Schedule from North America (Canadian Valentine tanks, Bren carriers,aluminium, copper, zinc, ferrochrome and ferrosilicon) and of raw materials fromthe Indian Ocean and Australasia (rubber, sisal, tea, shellac, graphite, wool andlead) go far to demonstrate to the russians that we are continuing supplies fromloading areas from which shipment is possible.6. I therefore recommend that the War Cabinet accept the principles &quot;setout in paragraph 2 above subject to a particular exception being made toprinciple (a) in respect of four ships, which carry large cargoes of high-prioritygoods including about 100 Hurricanes and which had been intended for despatchby P.Q. 18, to be sailed this week for the Persian Gulf.7. The Air Ministry can undertake to assemble at Basra the Hurricanesloaded on these ships, but stipulate that the Soviet authorities must undertaketo send ferry pilots to fetch them from the assembly point. The Soviet Govern-ment have been asked whether they can operate and maintain these aircraft on theSouthern Front, but have not yet replied; I recommend, however, that the aircraft should nevertheless be sent without waiting for an answer on this point, since, ifthe Russians cannot take delivery at Basra or operate them on their southern front, good use can be made of them by our own air forces in the Middle East.8. As the supplies sent by the Persian Gulf route have hitherto consisted of relatively low priority goods, it is necessary now to draw up a new prioritylist. I am arranging for an examination to be made by the Departmentsconcerned with a view to working out such a list, which can be agreed with theAmerican authorities and communicated to the Soviet Government as the basis on which we would work pending alternative suggestions from them.9. The application of principle (b) in paragraph 2 above makes it necessaryto plan ahead for the reopening of the Northern route. Mr. Harriman has pointedout the necessity for having as soon as possible at least a tentative programme for the number of ships to be taken in. convoy during the winter months, inorder to help the United States authorities to adjust their production.to fit in-with the tonnage which can be escorted by that route. I have therefore asked that the Admiralty should be ready with such a.programme to be.brought intoeffect as soon as it is possible to forecast, however tentatively, the resumption of&apos;Northern convoys.10.   To sum up I propose :  (a) That we should adopt the principles recommended by the shippingauthorities as set out in paragraph 2 subject to the particularexception explained, in paragraph^;(b) That the 4 P.Q. 18 ships mentioned in paragraph 6 should be sailed bythe next southbound convoy;(c) That we should proceed with the preparation of a new priority list ofUnited Kingdom supplies to be sent via the Persian Gulf;(d) That the Admiralty should submit as soon as possible a plan for futureconvoy arrangements by the Northern route.. : If the: War Cabinet approve these proposals I would explain our decisions/to the Soviet Ambassador, and at the same time ask him for an early answer to thequestion about the operation of fighter aircraft on the Soviet Southern front.ei     . : . &apos; - &apos; &apos;   A.
