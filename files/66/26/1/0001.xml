(42) 255 of the 16th &quot;June, I circulate(Appendix I) for the consideration of the War Cabinet a telegram from theViceroy, giving his appreciation of the situation.I also circulate (Appendix II) a summary of a report of the discussion inthe Congress Working Committee on Gandhi&apos;s original draft of the CongressWar Resolution, the text of which will be found in W.P. (42) 255. This throwsmuch light on the differences of opinion in the Committee.L. S. A.India Office, June 27, 1942.   ,APPENDIX I.Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State for India,dated June 26, 1942.(Immediate.)1928-S.FOLLOWING is appreciation of present position vis-a-vis Gandhi and congress : 2. Cabinet will be familiar with recent happenings. Position as I see itis, briefly, that Cripps&apos;s negotiations disclosed (a) a certain readiness on thepart of Congress to retreat, which was danger envisaged by Gandhi and whichhe did his best to offset; (b) they also involved a much more formal acceptanceof the principle of Pakistan, &amp;c.; (c) when negotiations broke down Congresshad become involved in them to an extent which considerably weakened their position of entire refusal to accept bona fides of His Majesty&apos;s Government andof antagonism to retention of British connection with this country. Nehruhimself was as deeply implicated as anyone; (d) following on collapse of Cripps&apos;s negotiations Gandhi suffered defeat and consequent loss of face in Allahabaddiscussions over his war resolution.This was followed by defection of Rajagopalachari, who is still running hisown opposition campaign, for which he has received a measure of support.[24012] - &apos; b
3. I have always thought that two matters which weigh with Gandhi were,first, his personal vanity, and, second, his. desire to keep Congress together.Situation described in the preceding paragraph threatened both. Congressshowed signs of disintegration, had lost prestige and position in the country, andit had been made clear that Gandhi&apos;s words were no longer entirely authoritativewith it. He was bound in these circumstances either to let process of disintegrate-tion (and parallel process of increasing loss of face on his own part) continue,or to endeavour by dramatic gesture to reconcentrate attention on himself andto reconsolidate divided ranks of Congress.4. The first method of achieving these objects was &quot; Britain getting out &quot;slogan. To that very general (? refrain) he has endeavoured to (? hitch), firstly,general fears of Japanese with suggestion that were we not here India wouldhave nothing to fear about Japanese aggression; secondly, grievance, minor butobviously far more acutely felt by rank and file, which may arise in operationalareas in connection with orders to evacuate houses and holdings as result of ourdenial policy, &amp;c. He has secured utmost publicity both here and in UnitedStates for &quot; Britain getting out &quot; slogan, and a fortnight ago it looked as though,assuming that that slogan were a success, and that if it was followed by anappeal for mass civil disobedience movement, non-payment of land revenue orother move designed to interfere in our war effort, we might have to take on aserious battle with Congress in immediate future.5. The last fortnight, however, has, in my judgment, eased the situation.Gandhi, somewhat unwisely perhaps, made it clear that it was not only the Britishbut the Americans also who must leave the country. The Harijan contained aseries of somewhat insulting comments on American colour policy, treatment ofnegroes, &amp;c, while American soldiers have been bracketed with British asunwelcome. And while Gandhi has seen a large number of American press correspondents, the accounts in Harijan show that his talks with them have atleast on one occasion led to &quot; some exasperation &quot; on part of his visitor. Hehas not, so far as I am aware, had a good American press, and he is, of course,very sensitive to that. So far as India is concerned, unreal character of his proposals, failure to accept reality of Japanese menace, &amp;c.,has probably beencontributory cause of what is undoubtedly a fact, that he did not get too good a press even in Indian papers which support Congress. There are indications alsothat soundings taken of provinces had not been wholly encouraging from his pointof view : and while he has got Nehru and Kalam Azad on his side, bur informa-tion suggests that neither of them is prepared to go in for mass civil disobedience.Finally, Jinnah has now published statement, gist of which you have seen, which shows that he is not prepared to acquiesce in Gandhi&apos;s policy, or in any action by His Majesty&apos;s Government or Gandhi which may prejudice Moslem claims.6. The Mahatma&apos;s reactions to this position are shown by fact that in last ten days he has spared no opportunity &apos;&apos; to interpret &apos;&apos; (and in the process tocloud and befog) his original slogan. No metaphysician could now draw anyreally firm conclusion from original slogan read with variety of riders whichGandhi has passed upon it. He is thus, so far as broad policy stands, in position,which he always tries to create, in which he has the operation of a policy not clearly understood by either his followers or world at large and the definition ofwhich remains entirely in his own hands.7. At the same time, while he may not have had response for which he had hoped, he has with singular success again focussed attention in this country(and I should have thought also abroad) on himself. By securing support (underwhatever limitations) of Nehru and Azad, he has got the backing of main figures in Working Committee, and the attention concentrated on Gandhi has stillfurther detracted from significance and activities of Rajagopalachari. He hasthus secured without any open clash with us certain of objects which he may be presumed to have had in view in launching his present agitation, and to that extent the need for extreme measures may perhaps be rather less from his pointof view than it was at an earlier stage. It is very relevant, too, that Gandhi, sofar as I can judge, has lost none of his political astuteness, and I remain of theopinion that he is as unlikely as in past, particularly at his age and the somewhatshaky condition of Congress, to engage in a battle in which he does not feel fairlyconfident of victory.
8. I see no sign of any particular excitement in the country. As suggested above, I doubt if response to an appeal for mass civil disobedience by Gandhiwould be in any sense whole-hearted.  Nor do I think such an appeal likely.9. The next stage is meeting of the Working Committee of Congress on 6th July. There is at this moment no clear indication of what proposition Gandhiis likely to put before them. I doubt myself if he is really yet clear in his mind.Moreover, he is essentially opportunist. It may be that the course of Libyancompaign over the next fortnight will materially affect the line which theWorking Committee and Gandhi will take.   That we cannot judge.10. I am, however, advised that, whatever the Working Committee decide,it would be impossible for them to implement it, particularly if they have to gofor confirmation to All-India Congl&apos;es&quot;s&quot;&quot;Committee, within at least a fortnightfrom the date of their meeting. On that assumption, there-is-notra&quot;&apos;&apos;greaT3eal tobe gained at this stage by my examining for benefit of the Cabinet alternativepossibilities. I would prefer, on the whole, therefore, to wait until the working committee has met, and thereafter to advise you and the Cabinet in the light oftheir conclusion. There need be no delay about that, and I should be (? able to)avoid wasting your time by examining a series of hypotheses. Meanwhile, I will,of course, keep you in closest touch with any developments that may affect thegeneral situation.11. But I think I can properly at this stage record the following generalpropositions : (a) Neither His Majesty&apos;s Government nor I have any desire to take on Congress if we can avoid that consistently with maintaining war effort and provisions of the law, &amp;c. We have quite enough on our hands already, (b) Onthe other hand, if Congress attitude forces us to take them on, we must beprepared to do so and with the utmost vigour. That would be the case whetherCongress attempted a policy of mass or individual civil disobedience throughoutthe whole country, or, alternatively, to slow down work in connection with war effort, or, alternatively (perhaps in some ways as likely as any), issue instruc-tions to refuse to pay land revenue or to individuals in operational areas to get in the way of military arrangements for evacuation of areas, occupation of buildings, &amp;c, and denial policy, (c) We might be prepared to contemplate the arrest of Gandhi, and, if necessary, of other leaders, if circumstances so dictate. I attach, I fear, little importance to other leaders, but Gandhi is a special case. Ifwe are forced to arrest bim, alternatives are to intern him outside India or inIndia. I have carefully considered these alternatives. In result, I conclude infavour of interning him in this country on same line as we had in view previously,viz., in a comfortable house, probably in Bombay Presidency, and giving all due consideration to him. He will, in my judgment, have far less popular appeal ifhe is interned here and be far less of a focus. I think effect, too, in United states will probably be less unfortunate if he is kept in his own country in comfortablesurroundings than if he is deported to Uganda or the like. Finally, we avoid any risk, of difficulties over food, medical attention, physical strain on him of a longair or sea passage, &amp;c.12.   I would, however, also add following comments : (a) If we are faced with serious trouble here and are (? to come) through itsuccessfully, I must be assured of complete backing of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. My Council have made a very strong point of this. Theycomplain that when they are invited to go all out against Congresstihey cannot risk position being radically changed at a moment&apos;s noticewithout consulting with them by a mission sent such as Cripps&apos;s from home which concentrates on Congress, and they urge very strongly thatif they are to get on the platforms and expose the fallacies of Congresspolicy they should do so with an assurance that they will not be thrownoverboard. I recognise that politics being what they are there cannotbe any last word in matters such as these. But I should like to be ableto assure my Council that in the event of their taking the line (andpolitical risks to themselves) involved they would do so with completebacking of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(&amp;) His Majesty&apos;s Government must be prepared to prepare the way in UnitedStates and at home, and to do really active propaganda for our course[24012] b 2
of action. I thought your telegrams to Home Department 10853 and10854 admirable on those lines, but ground requires very carefulpreparation.(c) (5 We) must be prepared to take a much more rigid line as regards news,broadcasts, &amp;c. I am telegraphing separately to you about B.B.C.,and suggesting that a far greater degree of control over Indianmaterial put out by it is called for. I can do a good deal myself withReuters; but I should have to look to you and to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to help so far as they could with Reuter and with pressgenerally. I recognise that we cannot prevent people like Sorensen, &amp;c,from asking questions in Parliament.APPENDIX II.Summary of Discussion in Congress Working Committee on the CongressWar Resolution, finally adopted en May 1.Nehru urged that Gandhi&apos;s draft made the wrong approach. The Britishcould not reasonably withdraw their troops even if they recognised independence;withdrawal of troops and the whole apparatus of civil administration would create a vacuum which could not be filled immediately. Moreover, the conquestof India is in the Japanese plan. If the British withdrew, the Japanese would insist on certain facilities aerodromes, occupation of strategic points, passagefor troops to the Middle East. Acceptance of the policy in Gandhi&apos;s draft wouldmake India a passive partner of the Axis Powers. He repeatedly emphasised this last point and said that the Japanese could not be stopped by non-violent non-co-operation, while Congress would get hostility from every other element outsidethe Axis Powers. The whole thought and background of Gandhi&apos;s draft was oneof favouring Japan. It was Gandhi&apos;s feeling that Japan and Germany wouldwin. He thought Congress were agreed (1) on their reactions to Government;(2) on their total inability to co-operate with Government; (3) on their policy notto embarrass Government because that would help the invader.Points made by speakers who supported Nehru were : Pandit Pant: The language about condemnation of the Cripps proposals is highly exaggerated-if the proposals were so bad, why did we spend so much timeover them? We must do our utmost to defend the country and swallow manythings. If I can&apos;t co-operate with the British it is because it is not consistent with our dignity. But the approach in Gandhi&apos;s draft makes every soldier I see my enemy.Asaf Ali: Telling the British to withdraw will do nobody any good.Bhulabhai Desai: The resolution is inconsistent with our previous stand. Wehave said that if offered an opportunity we shall side with the Allies.Satyamurti: I do not agree with the objection to the entry of foreign soldiers.India may defend herself even with the aid of foreign soldiers.Rajagopalachariar also criticised the original draft and its amendment byRajendra Prasad. The new interpretation of Congress policy would go terriblyagainst them, and Japan would say : &quot; Excellent!&quot; Japan would fill, the vacuumcreated by the British withdrawal. &quot; Our reaction to the evils of Britain shouldnot make us lose our sense of perspective. Do not run into the arms of Japan,which is what the resolution comes to.&quot;But in spite of Nehru&apos;s criticisms the majority of the Working Committeesupported Gandhi&apos;s draft, as amended by Rajendra Prasad.Kripalani: The resolution will not necessarily lead to the passage of Japanesearmies through India. Congress have asked British and Americans to withdrawthejr armies, and so also they ask others to keep out of their frontiers. &quot; If theydo not, we fight.&quot;
Patwardhan: If we do not take decisions Nehru&apos;s attitude will lead to abjectand unconditional co-operation with British machinery which must collapse.Co-operation with Britain is an invitation to Japan. The war is an imperialistwar. Our policy can be that we take no sides. I would reconsider the position if the Allies could defeat the Axis. But I see clearly that Britain is going towardsthe deep.  We want to create neutrality.Vallabhai Patel: The British cannot defend India. We cannot defend-iteither because they won&apos;t let us. But if they withdraw there is a chance for us.Congress to-day is reeling under two blows, one Cripps and the otherEajagopalachariar&apos;s resolutions. I feel Gandhi is instinctively right in the leadhe gives in all critical situations. It is time the door (to negotiations with theBritish Government) was finally closed after the repeated insults heaped on us.Sarojini Naidu: The draft is good as an expression of our extreme disgustand dislike and hatred of the British Government.Bishwanath Das: The Cripps proposals if accepted would have kept us in permanent bondage. The appeal to Britain to withdraw is very proper.A. N. Deo: Whatever unreality there is in Indian politics is due to Britishrale. Let it go and the unreality will disappear. I am not interested in defeatingHitlerite Germany.Maulana Kalam Azad:(jve&amp;t Britain has made &apos;it impossible for us todefend our country. If I felt that Japan was better than Britain and herinvasion was for the good of India I would have said so in public. Gandhi&apos;sprescription is the only alternative, though I doubt its effectiveness.Gandhi&apos;s resolution,- as amended by Raj en dr a Prasad, and an alternativeresolution submitted by Nehru were put to the vote. The former was adopted atthe morning session on the 1st May, but the matter was reopened at the afternoonsession and Nehru&apos;s draft was finally adopted.
