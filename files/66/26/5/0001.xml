THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 275.(also O.M. (42) 11.)June 29, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.AIR SERVICE TO THE MIDDLE EAST.(Previous Paper: O.M. (42) 9.)Report of an Ad Hoc Committee^ARISING from a Memorandumt by the Secretary of State for the colonies as Chairman of the Overseas Mails Committee drawing attention to deficiencies in the Air Mail Service to the Middle East, we were invited by the War cabinet at its Meeting on the 3rd November, 1941, to examine what steps could be takenjto improve the Air Service to the Middle East, and by what date the improve-ments could be effected (W.M. (41) 108th Conclusions, Minute 10).2. This Memorandum! gave particulars of the service then provided byeight flying-boats, suggested that no substantial improvement in the MailServices to the Middle East could be achieved without a considerable increase in aircraft, and recommended an increase in the weekly capacity from the thencurrent figure of 6,600 lbs. to 21,160 lbs., of which 13,500 lbs. was to be allocated to air mails 7,000 lbs. for troops&apos; mails and 6,500 lbs. for civil mails. The WarCabinet agreed that the provision of an adequate air service to the Middle east was an important military interest, and accepted the proposals in the Memo-randum in principle as indicating the steps which ought to be taken with this end in view.3. We have reviewed the matter in the light of the aircraft available and ofthe many competing claims for such aircraft, and in the result the Secretary ofState for Air has been able substantially to increase the aircraft allotted and tobe allotted to this route for all purposes. In particular, he has arranged for theaddition of 12 Whitleys and 5 Liberators, and the Ministry of Aircraft Produc-tion has converted the 12 Whitleys.&apos; 4. As will be seen from the Annex, the average weekly weights carried by-air to the Middle East rose from some 4,700 lbs. in November 1941 to nearly12,000 lbs. in April 1942, though the figures for May, owing to the interruption of the Boeing schedules from causes outside the control of the Air Ministry are substantially lower. It is expected that air capacity on the route will reach14,000 lbs. in June, 16,000 lbs. in September, 18,000 lbs in December and 25,000 lbs.in March 1943. The aircraft required represent the maximum which under present conditions the Secretary of State for Air is able to allocate to this route.* Secretary of State for the Colonies [in the Chair).First Lord of the Admiralty.Secretary of.

5. On the other hand, there has as yet been no improvement in the Air MailService. The allocation for all-air mails remains at its previous level of 1,200 lbs.a week, devoted wholly to airgraphs and thin postcards for the troops; theremaining capacity is allocated to urgent military freight, high prioritypassengers and Government despatches. The Secretary of State for Air proposes that when the figure of 14,000 lbs. a week is reached the allocation for air mailsshall be increased to 1,600 lbs. : and he takes the view that in present circum-stances the all-air service for troops mail should be limited to airgraphs and thinpostcards.6. The Postmaster-General points out that the increased allocationproposed for troops mail represents simply the growth of traffic owing to troopreinforcements, with no improvement in facilities. He maintains that theairgraphs and thin postcard services are palliatives which cannot meet the realneed for troops mail, and in this view he is supported by the Overseas MailsCommittee, on which the three Services are represented.* As evidence of thedemand for a speedy sealed letter service, he points to the substantial number of letters sent by the sea-cum-air service via West Africa (though the charge isIs. 3d. and the transit time 7^ weeks, as compared with 3d. and 2 weeks in thecase of airgraphs) and the great number of letters still sent by surface mail(though they go round the Cape and take some 10-12 weeks in transit); the latteramounts to about double the total number of airgraphs and thin postcardscombined for the same destinations. He accordingly urged that as soon as a weeklycapacity of 14,000 lbs. was available the allocation for troops mail should beincreased to 7,000 lbs., which would enable him to provide an adequate sealedletter service for the troops. He offered to forgo for the time being all claim tothe 6,500 lbs. needed for the carriage of civil mails by air.7. The Secretary of State for Air, with the support of the representativesof the Admiralty and the War Office present at our meeting, was not prepared, toagree to the view of the Postmaster-General and Overseas Mails Committee,maintaining that in present circumstances urgent military freight such as tankspares, high priority passengers, and Government despatches, should take priority over troops mail.8. Since it proved impossible for the members of the Committee to reach agreement on the question of allocation, the Chiefs of Staff were consulted as tothe proportion of the increased capacity which should be devoted, to troops mail.The Chiefs of Staff replied that they were unable to support the Postmaster-GeneraFs contention as the maximum capacity on the overseas air routes,particularly on the route to the Middle East, was required for urgent militaryfreight and high priority passengers.9. In conclusion, we are able to report that the total Air Service to theMiddle East has been improved and that further improvements are in prospect.But with regard to the specific question referred to us, the condition of the AirMail Service, our efforts have as yet failed to produce any improvement. Theincrease in the total Air Service has been almost wholly absorbed by the increasein the requirements set out in paragraph 7, and the only increase proposed formails, 400 lbs. a week, has already been absorbed by the growth of traffic owingto troop reinforcements. In the view of the Postmaster-General, unless and until a minimum weekly capacity of 5,000 to 7,000 lbs. is allocated to troops mail, itwill be impossible for him to make any substantial improvement in the presentservice.C.On behalf of the Committee.Colonial Office, S.W.1,29th June, 1942.* CM.
