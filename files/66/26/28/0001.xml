COPf NO.[12) 293juiy 17, WWAR cabinet report ON HOME OPINIONMemorandum &quot;by; t he Minister of InfomationAt the time of my last report, five weeks ago, I recorded a surge oforitimsni in the country, and a widespread belief in -the probability of the-ir&apos;s ending this rear.     Events have lost no time in correcting this tendencyConfidence has fallen, and the war is now once more expected to be a long one.The earlier over-confidence was brought to a head much more by the inauguration of our 1,000 bomber raids on Germany than by any other singlefactor,     The Libyan campaign was watched with a good deal of reserve by thepublic, even when official assurances were taken to be encouraging.     Reverseswould probably not have caused the depth of feeling they did had they notbeen marked by the fall of Tobrulc.     The past record of Tobruk, the comparisonwhich the public, without allowing for essential differences, drew between itand Sevastopol and the rapidity of the surrender combined to produce a sense of indignation quite independently of any feelings aroused by theParliamentary debate.     The debate itself did not substantially alleviatethis indignation.     Blame was freely distributed among a wide number ofrecipients, among whioh &quot;the generals&quot; and &quot;our leadership11 were certainlythe commonest.     Even when the survey shifted to questions of equipment and production, the emphasis was on the supposed failure of the &quot;authorities&quot; to plan the right types of weapons,     I stress this growing tendency to blameleaders or authorities for anything that goes wrong, for it is serious inits implications.     The dissatisfaction is certainly not centred on particulariiidividuals but seems to be directed at the whole range of Government orauthority,2. A widespread rumour of recent weeks is to the effect that the fall oflohrulc was due to &quot;fifth column&quot; work on the part of the South Africans or their commanding officer. An authoritative account of the fall of Tobruk:is badly needed.3.    Naturally these events aroused a great deal of public dissatisfaction with the way that the news load been presented to them.     I allow for thefact that criticism of news presentation invariably attends bad news; butthe natter is too important for mo to leave there.     A careful review of thewhble output of news over the period establishes that the officialcommuniques from the field are not to be blamed for misleading optimism.The general public, however, does not distinguish carefully between the varioussources of news, and it regards as in some way official the great bulk ofmat it reads in the papers or hears on the air as coming from the theatre ofj^t.   Some of its criticisms are justified.     In the result the distrust of official&quot; news has received further impetus,     War correspondents on the spotWfc a necessary feature of a campaign fought by a democracy, but a warcorrespondent who gets bad official guidance does more harm than good.     Onlt? other hand a war correspondent without official guidance at all is0^-y half as useful as he might be,      I note the present dissatisfaction since&quot; is a not unimportant element affecting the relations between Government^d public in the country.The Anglo-Russian communique referring to the Second Front in Europe in*k seems to have been generally understood as containing a formal obligation. our^side to open one.     Nevertheless it is not a subject which has aroused :J-yid interest yet, nor can it be said that there has been any noticeable10 olamour for action.     It seems to have fallen back for the time beihe29
to the TDlacc it occupied in the public mind before the joint declaration;it is tree ted as something desirable and inevitable but to be achieved only at the time raid in the manner sanctioned by those with expert knowledge.The Libyan reverses and the Parliamentary debate contributed to a furtherfeu-aping down of enthusiasm for a second front; but whether this lias beenoffset by the impact of recent events in Russia it is as yet too early to say.5.     The C-government&apos; s campaign for voluntary fuel economy is new under way and there is a widespread interest in the avoidance of waste, at any rate on the part of others.     Fuel rationing itself does not seem to be regardedas a menace to be avoided by large numbers of domestic consumers, and thereis no doubt that, if the voluntary appeal is to succeed in affecting the savings hoped for, a major and long-sustained effort is called for from theGovernment.6       The last matter of current public feeling to v.hich I feel that I oughtto draw attention is the difficulty over the provision of holiday travel.Prom many narts of the country complaints have come that, whereas theGovernment&quot;is arjocaling to the public to take holidays at home, facilities are still being&quot;made available for holiday travel to pleasure resorts at no great distance.      I am not seeking to suggest any view as to whether thereis substance or no substance in these complaints but they are certainly taken as evidence of a process which never fails to irritate the public; appeals from the Government for a course of action on the one hand and, on theother, maintenance of conditions that tend to defeat the purposes of the appeal.17th July, 1942B.B.
