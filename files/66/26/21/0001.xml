ills DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OPII13 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO:WAR cabinet british SUPPLY ORGidTI3ATI0N IN WASHINGTONNote by the Minister of ProductionIn paragraphs 13 and 14 of my Report on my visit to theUnited States (W.P.(42) 268),  I stated that it had become necessary for me to appoint a Deputy, who would act on mybehalf in Washington, and I made certain proposals relatingto the future of the British Supply Council.2,     The appointment of Sir Robert Sinclair as my Deputy in washington has already been announced.     He will represent meon the Combined Production and Resources Board,  the terms ofreference of which were given in Annex I to W.P.(42) 268.      Inorder that my Deputy may effectively perform his duties inrelation to the Combined Production and Resources Board,  it isessential that he should have authority to deal v/ith all aspects of the production picture - Navy, Army, Air, RawMaterials, and civilian programmes,  other than food.3.     As the British representative on the Combined Productionand Resources Board, Sir Robert must not be burdened withadministrative responsibility over the Supply Missions.      he must, however, be in.a position to call for the collaboration of those Missions and to directtheir work in such manner asin his judgment will enable him to carry out the mandate thatthe Prime Minister and the President have given to the combined Production and Resources Board.     The agreement of theMinisters responsible for those Missions is necessary.     my proposals may be summarised as follows:-&quot;The Minister of Production, British Memberof the Combined Production and resources board, has,  as has already been announced,appointed Sir Robert Sinclair as his Deputyon the Board.His Majesty&apos;s Government consider thatthe proper and prompt fulfilment by the combined Production and Resources Board of themandate entrusted to it by the two governments is of^the utmost importance for the conductof the war.

It is essential that in the fulfilment of his task, Sir Robert Sinclair shouldreceive the full co-operation of all theBritish Supply representatives in Washington,;ind that he should have the authoritynecessary to fulfil his mission^The Heads of the various Supply Missions,other than Pood, while remaining responsible in their procurement work to their Ministriesin London, will follow the directions which sir Robert Sinclair, under the authority ofthe Minister of Production, may find itnecessary to give them in the fulfilment ofhis function as defined by the Directiveestablishing the Combined Prodviction and resources Board.      Sir Robert Sinclair may callon the Supply llissions for any information,help, and assistance.     He has the authorityto form copimittees and to appoint such persons to committees as in his judgment, theci rcums tance s re qui re *The Joint Staff Mission will co-operatefully with Sir Robert Sinclair in his task.He will be a member of the british supply Council.,;4i     In paragraph 14 of W.P. (42)  268,  I proposed that myDeputy should assume the chairmanship of the British supply council in Washington.     For the present, however, I am ofthe opinion that Sir Robert Sinclair1s duties as british representative- on the Combined Production and Resources board will not leave him sufficiently free to do more than be amember of the British Supply council      In view however ofthe scope and nature of my responsibilities in America as  minister of Production it is important that it&apos; should berecognised that the Chairman of the Supply Council is responsible to me..      At a later date it may be foundadvisable that my Deputy should become Chairman of theSupply Council.5*     To sum up,  I recommend:-(i)  that the position and powers of my Deputy inthe United States of America ahould be as&quot;laiddown in paragraph 3 above(li)  that it be recognised that the appointment ofthe Chairman of the British Supply councils within my authority,  and that he is responsible to me*I ask my colleagues&apos; agreement to these recommendations,\ltdV) 0rL.... &apos; ii$peat George streetv SVvyv3-V10TH JULY, 1942.
