2The Chiefs of Staff to the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East.(97079.   24/6.)For Commanders-in-Chief from Chiefs of Staff, No. (M.E.) 276 :-The action taken in Middle East in releasing the ban on making comments on operations has resulted in a flood of criticism from correspondents in middle east and published in London newspapers to-day. Tone is extremely critical and enquiries are demanded both in Press and Parliament.2. The Government are not in possession of information with which to answer criticisms which have been made, and have delayed a debate by promisingas much information as possible early next week.3. We are most reluctant to ask for information of past operations when we know you have so many preoccupations, but we feel that we must ask you toprovide as an interim measure answers to the following questions which are nowbeing asked in Press and which are most likely to be asked in Parliament. Forour own information we should like your replies to be as full and explicit aspossible.  Matter which it is undesirable to publish will not be quoted here.4.   Questions (1) To what extent did the close defence of Tobruk enter into the generalscheme of defence when the Army originally stood on the Gazalaposition ?(2) When was decision to hold Tobruk taken ?(3) Is there any truth in statement that an alleged last-minute decision to throw troops into Tobruk led to disorganisation in defence?(4) In view short resistance Tobruk what were grounds for consideringgarrison adequate ?(5) How  in  fact  did our  equipment,  in  particular  tanks,  anti-tank(2-pounder and 6-pounder) and 25-pounders, compare with enemyequivalents ?   How many of each type were available 25th May inforward area?(6) Is Grant tank entirely satisfactory?(7) M.E. 109 alleged superior our fighters.   Is this so?(8) Air co-operation with Army is said to have been excellent.   But howis it that little interference with major enemy moves or supply seemsto have been caused ?(9) Was tank recovery and repair satisfactory and was there difficulty inmaking, right type of spare part available when required ?(10) Was every step taken to supply vital defences Bir Hakheim, includingstrong armoured escort for convoy?   Was there 75-mm. ammunitionavailable to send?(11) Was our armour used in small packets and not in bulk ?(12) What are facts of our losses in armour on 13th June alleged due torunning into enemy anti-tank guns.  On face of it appears that theremust have been inadequate reconnaissance.   This is being quoted in press as turning-point of battle ?(13) Was our training of staffs and junior commanders satisfactory?(14) Was there indecision on the part of higher commanders resulting in lossof opportunity?(15) Was there any lack of aggressive spirit?(16) Is there any explanation other than of exhaustion of our troops forfailure to follow up our initial success ?(17) Has failure of operation had any adverse effect on morale of Army?If so, is this due to any particular cause ?If there is any other important consideration not mentioned, we hope youwill include it in your reply.Answers are required by 28th
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-SECRET. Copy No.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.The Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, to the Chiefs of Staff.(CC/71.   25/6.)Reference CCS. (M.E.) 276, 24th June.Following for Chiefs of Staff from Commanders-in-Chief :  Answers to your questions are as follows :  1. The positions of 8th Army covering Tobruk comprised the Gazaladefences, Bir Hacheim and an intervening position occupied by 5( ?)th infantry brigade. This was extended in depth by the defences of Tobruk and preparedpositions of El Adem and Acroma, so that whole area Gazaia-Tobruk-BirHacheim formed one defensive system. Throughout operations Tobruk wasgarrisoned by approximately one division, whose task was to defend the perimeter against an enemy thrust which might penetrate the forward positions,and also to defend the port and base against seaborne or airborne attack.2. The defences of Tobruk, with El Adem and Bel Hamed formed a defensive position which General Ritchie, was ordered to hold should evacua-tion of the Gazala position become necessary. Although the possibility of thetemporary isolation of Tobruk had to be accepted, it was intended to prevent itsinvestment and attack by operation of our armoured and. mobile forces from south and south-east. The rapid attrition of our armoured forces, however,necessitated the evacuation of El Adem and Bel Hamed, and enabled the enemy to establish himself on the escarpment and hold off our mobile forces, whichwere then too weak to interfere seriously with attack on Tobruk. The garrison of Tobruk synchronised position to meet attack before the evacuation of el Adem L (?), and Bel Hamed. The prolonged investment of Tobruk by enemy-was not contemplated, as it was considered that with our main forces holding theSidi Rezegh-Bel Hamed area, and also prepared positions in Salum-Maddalenaarea, it would be possible rapidly to reorganise and rebuild our armoured forcesso as to resume the offensive without appreciable delay, while our mobile forcesprevented enemy staging a strong attack on Tobruk.3. No, since main part of garrison of Tobruk was 2nd South AfricanDivision and 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, both formations having been inTobruk since battle began. Other formations entered Tobruk, having withdrawnfrom fighting at El Adem L and Knightsbridge in understandable disorganisation-tion, but these should have occasioned no difficulty to garrison Commander.4. The garrison which remained in Tobruk was practically the samestrength in men and weapons and tanks as that which held Tobruk during greaterpart of last year, and they had supplies and stocks adequate for 90 days&apos;resistance. This was the largest garrison which could be spared without undulyweakening the main body of the 8th Army. The defences were as strong, if notstronger, than last year, and there was every reason to suppose at the time thatour general defensive position would hold and plaj&apos; its part in defence of the fortress.  The reasons why garrison was not able to hold out are not yet known.5. Equipment. In terms of equipment, the only tank capable of meetingGerman tanks on anything approaching equal terms is Grant. We deployed138 Grant against 320 Mark (III) and (IV) German tanks. All other tanks.Crusader, Stuart, Valentine, Matilda, now hardly count in armoured battle, for[24014-2]
lack of a more powerful weapon than the 2-pounder. The 2-pounder anti-tankgun does not penetrate German frontal armour, and the German tactics ensurethat their A.F.Vs. did not present their vulnerable flanks and rear. The 2-pounderis therefore of doubtful value except in large numbers at short range. the-pounder did well. The 25-pounder in its proper role remains a first-classweapon. At beginning of battle 8th Army deployed 516 2-pounders, 1126-pounders, and 464 25-pounders, and 138 Grant tanks.6. 823 Grant tanks is a fine fighting army, which stands up to heavypunishment; its main defect is that its 75-mm. gun has a very limited traverse.To that extent it is not entirely satisfactory. This defect is remedied in latermodels not yet available in Middle East.7. The Me. 109 is superior in all-round performance to our Hurricanes,Kittyhawks and Tomahawks. The Spitfire is generally equal in performance at most altitudes, but only six were available for battle.8. Air co-operation throughout action was admirable, and we know theenemy suffered heavy casualties through our confirmed action. But troops movingdispersed in open desert do not present decisive targets to air action, howeverpowerful, and are unlikely ever to do so. The enemy naval liaison officers act aswell as we do.9. &apos; Until 13th June, 1942, tank recovery very, satisfactory 460 recovered,200 repaired in field, 130 evacuated, 130 under repair in forward workshops.After this date, through battlefield, recovery was impossible in most cases.Since commencement battle 250 have been evacuated from workshops and 153have been written off destroyed. Spare-part situation was reported to be atforward workshops throughout as result special air and road delivery to fieldpositions. Notable exception was spares and assembly for Grant tanks, of whichnone had been received prior to battle, and only 22 and 30 cases engine sparesreceived during battle. You will appreciate this necessitates cannibalisation.Result is to-day, 40 tanks are without engines, and a further 15 tanks arestripped of guns, suspensions and engines.10. The full story of Bir Hacheim is not very well known. It is, however,clear that garrison was fully supported by every means which military situationpermitted, and in spite of hostile investment, supplies and water entered BirHacheim. Supplies were also flown in by air. There was sufficient 75-mni.ammunition. When garrison was withdrawn there were still supplies andammunition available in post. The withdrawal from Hacheim was supportedby mobile troops, including tank units.11. The organisation of armoured regiments included squadrons ofCrusaders or Stuarts and squadrons Grants on basis one Grant squadron to two squadrons of Crusader type. It was hoped this would strengthen fighting powerof all armoured units engaged. In retrospect, the Crusader-type tanks showedsuch low fighting value that burden of battle in all units was borne by Grants.To that extent, therefore, Grants were not used in mass. This lesson has beenlearned, particularly since Crusader mounting a 2-pounder is no longer fit to face the modern German tank. It is noteworthy that practically all armoured fighting took place in triangle Acroma-El Adem-Knightsbridge, and mainstruggle was on south side of Trigh Capuzzo, near Knightsbridge. Ourarmoured divisions do not appear to have been unduly dispersed in this fighting.12. We have not yet been able to examine facts armoured action of13th June, and it is possible crucial (corrupt group) counter-stroke on enemy&apos;snorthern flank met powerful anti-tank flank guards which he used with consider -able skill... It cannot be said there was inadequate tactical reconnaissance,particularly under abnormal condition armoured fighting was in barren and verydusty area, where at an early date moves look very much alike at even 476 yards,and it is almost impossible to distinguish friend from enemy. This condition isseldom understood by critics. It is quite possible that much of the damage was done by powerful self-propelled 88-mm. anti-tank dome anti-aircraft gun, whichGermans alone possess and which we badly need ourselves. It is probable ourarmoured defeat on 13th June was turning-point of a long passing through battlesince (corrupt group) the enemy secured an armoured superiority in open country,it was also clearly necessary to withdraw infantry of 8th Army from a dangerousposition.
13. It is possible to train staff officers as such in war time quickly andthoroughly, and there had been no complaint about staff working, which appearsto be very satisfactory. It is impossible to train junior commanders so quickly and a tactical sense is sometimes long development, particularly in quick mobilearmoured action. Training of commanders has been continuous^ even in foremostarea, but we are still largely an amateur army fighting professionals.14. So recent is battle, and so much to be done since, that there has notbeen time to review little evidence we possess. Certain phase commanders havebeen replaced, and this must be regarded as normal in any long passing throughbattle. We find no indications of indecision on part highest command on available evidence.15. None. Men fought to end and continued attack in full realization ofdisparity in equipment between ourself and enemy.16. Our initial success was, in fact, a repulse of enemy&apos;s massed attack.The enemy was by no means beaten and drew off from battle in good order coveredskilfully by powerful anti-tank weapons, to which we have referred to in para-graph 12 above. Definite attack on these weapons by tanks failed. An infantrycounter-stroke designed to clear aside this anti-tank screen and make way for an(corrupt group) penetration of Cauldron began well, but petered out owingenemy&apos;s disposition in depth and eventually succumbed to heavy interveningcounter-attacks, significant our own armour was inadequate to protect flank of infantry. The major fact of battle is that, though on first day the 8th Armychecked and threw back enemy&apos;s massed armoured assault, its own armour sufferedso seriously in that encounter as to make it impossible for General Ritchie both to contain enemy in area to which he had recoiled and to develop a counter-offensive against his rear. A little better fortune on this first day might have left us with a margin superiority sufficient both to contain enemy and to counter-attack. The exhaustion was British material rather than physical or moralexhaustion, since it was clearly evident that greater part of our tanks had very low fighting value. This fact has prevented (?) subsequent operations, and wiilcontinue to do so until we attain equality in Grants or rearm Crusaders with6-pounders.17. There is no indication that our failure has had any adverse effecton the 8th Army. All formations and units fought tenaciously even when(corrupt group) run and may be expected to continue to fight in that way. Wewould like to stress that this battle was won by a small but very well-armed and well-organised body of German troops, the equivalent of two armoured andone mechanised division. There victory is due to better equipment in hand of highly trained troops. Undoubtedly the day of large infantry formation in western Desert is past. It is perfectly possible to re-organise our forces onan armed and mobilised basis which should be at least as effective as the Germandesert( ?) battle( ?) we are engaged in now, but it will mean considerable modifica-tion of the replenishment organisation which so far has restricted the developmentof a suitable striking force in Western Desert. The basis of this must be suitablearmoured fighting material and tank weapons. Reinforcements by majorformation (such as 8th Armoured Division) equipped with tanks of obsoletearmament is of little value. Once fully reorganised rearmed we do not doubtour ability to avenge this reverse. All efforts are being devoted to this objectnow. It must always be realised that all three fighting services in Middle Eastsuffer from a chronic shortage of material and personnel, in fact we live fromhand to mouth at critical periods, are expected to reinforce other theatres.Regarding our deficiencies we wish to refer you to Minister of State&apos;telegram MS/12.18. A strong force heavy bombers would have been some compensation forinability of Malta to operate air force submarines offensively against the enemylines of supply, and would also have enable us to bring an advantageous (corruptgroup) air&apos; attack against their communications and bases. With such a forcetherefore we should have been able to do something to prevent him building up his supplies in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica might have been able to null hisattack. Once the battle was joined a heavy bomber force, although it wouldhave been very useful, would not have had decisive effect on operations.T.O.O. 1922Z/25.
