THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1942.SECRET.   &apos; Copy-No.W.P. (42) 320.July 28, 1942.WAR CABINET.PUBLICITY FOR DOMINION AND UNITED KINGDOM TROOPS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.REPRESENTATIONS have been made to me recently by all the DominionHigh Commissioners in this country to the effect that inadequate publicity isgiven to the work done by units from the United Kingdom as contrasted withthat given to the achievements of Dominion and United States troops. although there has been some improvement, the evil continues. It has been noticedparticularly in respect of Middle East communiques. The effect both in theDominions and in the United States is most unfortunate and gives Goebbels anopportunity for misrepresentation which he does not miss. I am assured thatthis lack of balance as between troops from this island and those from overseashas caused indignation among Dominion troops who know the facts.2. The remedy would seem to lie in a greater particularity in official com-muniques from Cairo and more adequate descriptive articles by accreditedcorrespondents in the theatres of war. In particular, they should be allowed to mention the units engaged by name, as much confusion is caused by the attemptto describe troops from the United Kingdom as &quot;Imperial&quot; or &quot;British&quot;troops. The use of vague phrases such as &quot;a North Country regiment &quot; gets onenoAvhere. I cannot believe that the Germans in North Africa are ignorant of the units opposed to them.3. I suggest that steps should be taken to see that correspondents of papersfrom this country should be enabled to give as full accounts as are given by thoseof the Dominions and that the staff of the United Kingdom correspondents shouldbe adequate. I suggest that General Headquarters, Cairo, should be asked tosee that adequate publicity is accorded to troops from these islands in theircommuniques, and that the Minister of Information should take such steps as are open to him to get the editors of newspapers in this country to preserve areasonable balance.,C. R. A.Dominions Office,Downing Street, S. W. 1,July 28, 1942.[24158]
