General Review.NAVAL SITUATION.1.   Three U-boats have been sunk during the week.In the Mediterranean, Naval forces have carried out a bombardment of IVIersMatruh, and Naval aircraft have attacked shipping and land targets iconjunction with the R.A.F. b      11Shipping losses have been at the average high level of the past few weeksU-boats have maintained their activity in the Western Atlantic and have also attacked shipping in the Azores area.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. Two Steam Gunboats engaged a force of eight enemy motor patrol craftoff Etaples on the night of 9th/10th and in a brief action estimate that they sank one, probably sank a second and damaged four. There were no casualties in ourS.G.Bs. and only slight damage. -Three Motor Gunboats sank a heavily escorted tanker of 1,000 tons nearCherbourg on the night of 14th/15th and damaged two of the. escorting trawlers.During the week enemy aircraft have made several attacks on our light craftin the Channel and have sunk a Netherland Motor Minesweeper and a Fighting-French Chasseur (details are given in Appendix V).The Portuguese Carvalha Araujo (4,560 tons) was intercepted by H.M.Armed Boarding Vessel Imperialist on the 9th and sent into Gibraltar.Northern Waters.3. A further attack by aircraft was made on ships of the outward, boundRussian convoys on the night of the 9th/ 10th and five ships were probably sunk.From latest reports, twenty ships have been sunk (total about 120,000 tons), fourhave arrived at Archangel, six are in Nova Zemblan harbours, one is ashore on theNova Zemblan coast and two are unaccounted for.All the escort vessels have now reported at Russian ports.Mediterranean and Red Sea.4. H.M. Destroyers Dulverton, Hurworth, Eridge and Beaufort carried out a bombardment of the harbour and installations at Mersa Matruh on the night of11th/ 12th. Simultaneous air attack drove ships in harbour to sea. A 2,000-tonammunition ship was hit by naval aircraft and later blown up by the destroyers.Italian torpedo boats escaping to the westward were engaged with unknownresults.Aircraft reinforcements for Malta were flown off on the 15th from.M.S. Eagle.During the week some 20,000 tons of French merchant shipping have passed gibraltar eastbound and some 37,000 tons have passed westbound under escort.A floating dock and the German s.s. Liebenfels (6,318 tons) have been raised at Massawa by a United States salvage unit.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. United States aircraft sank U. 701 off Cape Hatteras on the 7th. H.M.South African Whalers Pro tea and Southern Maid, in conjunction with naval aircraft, sank an Italian U-boat north-west of Beirut on the 11th and took someprisoners. H.M. Sloop Ltdworth sank an Italian U-boat (the Pietro Calm,1,300 tons) 100 miles south of the Azores on the 14th, and captured 30 prisoners.Thirty-eight other attacks have been reported during the week : 25 by aircraft,11 by surface craft and two by submarines. Fifteen attacks were made off theeast coast of North America, five in the Gulf of Mexico, four in the Caribbeanand four in the Bay of Biscay.Of the surface attacks, two made by H.M.S. Pelican and escorts of a southern-bound convoy in the vicinity of the Canaries and an attack by ELM. Ships Brambleand Seagull at the entrance to the White Sea were promising. Aircraft working in the Bay of Biscay have surprised U-boats on the surface on several occasions,both by day and night, and three attacks show considerable promise. Both of the attacks by submarines, which took place in Northern Waters, were unsuccessful
Enemy Intelligence.German.6 The pocket battleship Lutzow has moved southward to Trondheim andthe light cruiser Koln has moved northward from southern Norway.Italian.7. It is possible that the new battleship Roma (35,000 tons, 9 15&quot;) is doingher trials.  It is believed that she can be ready for service before the autumn.Some Italian shipping has crossed the Mediterranean rather further to theeast than formerly, sailing via the -aegean and Crete. Every endeavour is beingmade to use Tobruk and Mersa Matruh, in spite of demolitions and our heavy attacks on the ports.Japanese.8. There are some indications that Japanese naval forces are leaving theAleutian Islands and coming south : otherwise there is no change in the disposi-tion of the Japanese forces.U-Boats.9. The number of U-boats operating in the Atlantic remains high; abouteleven are operating in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, six betweenFlorida and New York, and eight, including three Italian U-boats, in the areanorth-east of the Bahamas. There has been a recurrence of activity in the EasternAtlantic and U-boats have been in contact with convoys off the North-western approaches and near the Canaries. U-boats are now passing north of the shetlands at the rate of 15 a month.The number of U-boats in Northern Norway remains at 17.There is evidence that the U-boats at Jaluit (Japanese Mandated Islands)now number 20-25. There have been two reports of sightings off the Australiancoast and four U-boats appear to be working in the Mozambique channel.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending midnight 12th/13th, 1,278 ships, including356 Allied and 32 neutral, have been convoyed.Of these, 322 ships were in Ocean convoys, 951 in British coastal convoys and five in Western Atlantic convoys.Two anti-aircraft ships, 56 destroyers (including two United states destroyers) and ninety-four sloops, cutters, corvettes and fleet minesweepers were employed on escort duty.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending 11th July totalled 961,000 tons, compared with 459,000&apos; tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 654,500 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 382,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. Reports have been received of U-boat attacks on eighteen steam andone sailing ship and of these nine are known to have sunk. Twelve of these attacks occurred in the Western Atlantic, five in the Eastern Atlantic and twoin the Mediterranean.Three of the ships sunk in the Eastern Atlantic had recently dispersed froma convoy south of the Azores.Aircraft sank a small ship in convoy off the Cornish coast and a Japanesewider captured a ship in mid-Indian Ocean.British Minelaying.12. Minelaying by naval units has been carried out to the south-west of the faroes, off the Flemish coast and in the Bay of Biscay.Aircraft laid a considerable number of mines off the German North SeaCQast and in the Bay of Biscay.
Enemy Minelaying and British Minseweeping.13. It is believed that enemy aircraft laid mines on one night, 12th/13th,when 40 aircraft were operating in the Thames estuary.E-boats laid mines oft&apos; Beachy Head on one night and to the east of Ports-mouth on another. Enemy vessels are thought to have laid a minefield to thenorth-east of Barfleur. , ,   .  .Forty-one magnetic and four acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek. The mine totals now are : 2,442 magnetic, 1,310 acoustic and 1,444 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.14. The Swedish ships Lulea (5,611 tons), with a cargo of iron ore, andthe Margareta (1,272 tons), carrying coke, both bound for Germany, were sunkin the Baltic on the 11th and 9th respectively. The German Otto Cords (906 tons)is also reported torpedoed and sunk in the Baltic on the 8th.The Italian Laura C. (6.181 tons) has been reported sunk; she was last heardof at Tripoli (L).MILITARY SITUATION.Egypt.15. On the 8th July activity on both sides was confined to patrols byarmoured cars. On the next day, after an attack by Stuka dive-bombers, the enemyoccupied the Deir El Qattara locality with a force comprising 25 tanks and about 200 M.T. In the afternoon our columns successfully engaged, enemy tanks and M.T. and compelled them to move northwards. Four enemy tanks wereknocked out.16. On the 10th, enemy pressure on the west flank of the 13th &quot;Corps was maintained with the occupation of the Bab El Qattara locality, which it was not intended to hold. Between thirty and forty enemy tanks were reported in thearea west of Deir El him a.Units of our forces launched an attack in the northern sector to capture the high ground Tel El Eisa and Tel El Makh Khad (respectively 10 miles north-west and 6 miles west of El Alamein railway station). These objectives were achieved.. The enemy then put in a partially successful counter-attack, but our forces later restored the situation and consolidated. They were, however, unableto exploit their success further owing to tenacious enemy resistance. during their advance on the 10th an enemy tank force was encountered. Fifteen guns andsome motor transport were captured and-1,000 enemy prisoners taken.17. On the 11th, enemy pressure on the southern sector of our frontincreased and. our troops withdrew some 6 miles before the situation wasstabilised. On the following day, in the northern sector the enemy attacked our troops on the high ground at Tel El Eisa. German lorried infantry, supported bytanks and artillery gained a temporary footing but were later thrown back. Inthe central sector our troops made a slight advance to the west of Deir El him a,while to the south the enemy was on the defensive.18. On the 13th the enemy made three attacks, supported by tanks, on TelEl Eisa and El Alamein. All were pushed back before reaching our minefields.In the central sector there were local tank engagements during the afternoon,though the final dispositions of both sides remained unchanged. In the southan enemy motorised column of tanks was heavily engaged at last light, and was reported by nightfall to have obtained a footing on the Garet El Himeimatfeature.19. Late in the day on the 14th our forward troops in the northern sectorwere heavily attacked by an enemy armoured formation. They held their ground,however, and destroyed several enemy tanks. In the central sector on the night of the 14th/15th our forces carried out attacks against enemy positions on thewestern end of the El Ruweisat ridge. These attacks were mostly successful, inspite of the strong opposition encountered. On the southern sector there was little activity and the enemy made no attempt to advance.
20.   On the 15th, in the northern sector, the enemy held the Tel El Eisaounds all day, whilst our forces retained possession of the high ground to the firth and east of the railway.   In the central sector our troops consolidated!\onff the Ruweisat ridge eastwards from a point south of Deir El Shein, withsome0 of our armoured units in support.   During the afternoon the enemy wasbserved to be concentrating opposite our positions, and towards evening a heavy attack, supported by tanks, developed.   This attack achieved some success and our forward elements were driven back.Russo-Gernian Campaign.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Northern Sector.21.   The Russians have renewed their attacks though it is not known on what scale on the front of the River Volkhov, south-east of Leningrad.   There-had been a lull in operations in this area since the end of June.Central Sector.22. German attacks south-west of Rzhev, - designed primarily to pin theRussians in the Central Sector, as well as to-eliminate an awkward salient, haveforced a Russian withdrawal, the exact area and extent of which are unknown.The Russians, for their part, in an effort to influence the battles in the SouthernSector, have continued to attack strongly north and north-east of Orel. Terri-torially they have gained little, but their endeavours may have some diversionaryeffect.Southern Sector. /23. The German offensive in the Ukraine has been progressively extendedto the south. It has consisted of four separate thrusts : The first, from Kursk,has reached beyond the River Don to Voronezh, though no attempt is yetapparent to exploit the bridgehead thus gained. The Russians are seeking to strike at the Northern flank of this thrust, and may have met with some smallsuccess. The second, from Byelgorod, has penetrated as far as the Don west ofSvoboda. No attempt has been made, however, to cross the river at this point.The third, from Kupyansk, has reached beyond Rossosh, on the railway lineMoscow-Voronezh-Rostov, and is now driving south-eastwards on a courseparallel with the Don. The fourth, from Isyum and Slavyansk, is moving east-wards, along the River Donets, and has reached beyond Lisichansk. Yet a fifththrust in the extreme south towards Rostov seems probable, and unconfirmedreports suggest that it may already have begun.Caucasia.24. The Germans have intensified their air reconnaissance and bombing ofthe Taman Peninsula, east of the Kerch Straits, and of the Caucasian coast. a combined operation against Caucasia, therefore, seems likely.Summary.25. In this instance the German offensive apparently aimed primarily at a territorial advance rather than at the annihilation of Russian forces, as therehave been four parallel thrusts with no attempt at encirclement. The twonorthern thrusts threatened the flank of the Russian forces to the south, and partat least of the latter were withdrawn. This probably explains why Germanclaims to prisoners have been comparatively small. It now appears, however, thatthe two southern arms of the four-pronged advance may be turning southwards,presumably with the intention of cutting off and destroying all the Russian forces to the west of the Donets.India.Sind.26. Operations against the Blurs (a terrorist sect responsible for recentoutrages, including the derailment of the Lahore mail train) are proceeding satisfactorily. Indian paratroops carried out a successful dropping operation on the 1st July in co-operation with land forces.
North-East India and Burma.27. There has been only slight activity in the Homalin area on the Chindwin,where the Japanese appear to be organising a local traitor force.In the Kalemyo area there has been increased Japanese and rebel Bunnauactivity. Successful allied air attacks on enemy concentrations are helping tostiffen the resistance of the Chin tribes.Far East.28. In China the Japanese are attempting to complete their occupation ofChekiang but pressure on Kiangsi has decreased. In the South-West Pacificthey have&apos;extended their hold on the Solomon Islands by occupying Guadalcanal-.The general impression given by recent Japanese activities in this area is thatthey0are in process of establishing an operational base, either for defensive purposes or, more probably, with an eye to further extension to the south-eastward.There has also been considerable enemy reconnaissance of the Gilbert and ElliceIslands This may foreshadow the occupation of these groups and/or Ocean andNauru Islands, to&quot; the west of the Gilberts. Such an operation would probablybe based on Jaluit (Marshall Islands) rather than on the new Solomon Islands base.Intelligence.France.29. There are indications that a twenty-sixth Panzer division may be in process of formation in Brittany. The presence in the same area of 17th Inf.Div which has been withdrawn from Russia, suggests that this division maybe in course of conversion into a Panzer division. The estimated number ofGerman divisions in France remains at 25.AIR SITUATION.General.30. A daylight attack on U-boat yards at-Danzig was carried out by aircraft of Bomber Command.  Duisburg w-as the only target bombed at night.Our aircraft in Egypt co-operated with the land forces and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.United Kingdom.31.   Fighter Command flew 850 defensive sorties by day and 285 by night.Enemy activity against this country was slight, only 35 aircraft flying over-land.  One was destroyed and two were damaged by our night fighters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.32. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched^ 1,185 and 89 offensive sorties respectively, compared with 78 and 18 last week.Heavy bombers raided U-boat yards at Danzig. This Baltic port, nearly900 miles from England, is the most distant point we have attacked in daylightup to the present time. The 44 Lancasters which were despatched ran into heavycloud, with icing conditions and electrical storms. Navigation was difficult, but26 of them reached their target during a severe thunderstorm and dropped48 tons of H.E. bombs, which caused a number of fires. On the same day a smallattack was made by Mosquitos on U-boat yards at Flensburg. From these operations three of our aircraft did not return.Our fighters, including Mustangs of Army Co-operation Command, con-tinued to attack targets in the coastal districts of enemy-occupied territory and several large-scale sweeps were carried out, the majority of which were without incident. On a few occasions hostile fighters were encountered; three were destroyed, another was probably destroyed and four were damaged. We W12 fighters, mainly from anti-aircraft fire; three of our pilots are safe.
7140flight- mm HHHHHHH H9j ISHSHHRHBHRHHiil^HMH33. Bomber Command operated against land targets on one night only,when 210 sorties were despatched, compared with 639 during last week.Duisberg was the principal target. Heavy cloud and thunderstorms were encountered, but 162 aircraft dropped 342 tons of bombs. An extensive explosionand some large fires were reported in the target area. Six of our aircraft are missing from this operation.Coastal Operations.34. Coastal Command flew 563 sorties, 45 of which were on convoy escort,gapping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 1,035 sorties.A total of 215 aircraft of Bomber Command laid 414 sea-mines in enemy waters.   Three aircraft are missing.A group of light craft of the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy were attacked by 25 enemy fighters while on rescue operations six miles off Boulogne. One of thelaunches was sunk and three others damaged; there were several casualties, twoof them fatal. The launches rescued two pilots from the sea and claim to have destroyed one F.W. 190 and damaged another. Spitfires shot down two moreF.W. 190s, probably destroyed another and damaged a fourth. One of our fighters was lost, but the pilot is safe.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.35. The strength of our air attacks on enemy forces was on an increasedscale. During the week ending the 13th June 3,297 sorties were flown by our aircraft.Light bombers, fighter-bombers and Naval Albacores continuously attacked enemy landing grounds, tanks, M.T. concentrations and other military targets inthe forward area.Heavy damage was inflicted on enemy tanks and motor vehicles and manyaircraft on the ground were either destroyed or damaged. In one attack by fighter-bombers on the enemy&apos;s southern flank at least five tanks were destroyed and ten large diesel lorries and five troop-carrying vehicles were either destroyed or damaged. In another attack direct hits were obtained on six tanks, twoarmoured cars and twenty motor vehicles.A large number of reconnaissances and offensive patrols were flown by our fighters. Beaufighters made two attacks on Ju. 52s (troop-carrying aircraft)escorted by fighters southbound for Tobruk. Three Ju. 52s were destroyed andeleven were damaged. Five Beaufighters were damaged by machine-gun fire fromtroops inside the enemy aircraft.Shipping in Tobruk Harbour was attacked on six nights by a total of298 Wellingtons, seven Halifax and six Fortresses. At least three ships were hit and near misses were scored on five others. Large fires were started in the dock area.Benghazi Harbour was bombed on two nights by a total of eleven Liberators.Three ships were hit and a near miss was obtained on another.Mersa Matruh was attacked in daylight by Baltimores. Bombs fell on thejetty, on a concentration of M.T. and on a 1,500-ton ship, which was sunk.Shipping in the inlet at El Gazala was bombed by Wellingtons.Enemy aircraft were more active than for the past two weeks, although thescale of effort was considerably below ours. There was an increase ,in the numberof bombing attacks by Ju. 87s. and Ju 88s.In ail these operations our fighters destroyed 38 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 24 and damaged 45. A.A. guns destroyed a further two. We lost 34aircraft.Malta.36.   A total of about 130 bombers, escorted by 260 fighters, attacked - the island.Bombs were dropped on the-aerodromes at Luqa and Takali. Six of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground and 16 were damaged. An Army barrackswas destroyed and another damaged.
Our fighters destroyed 40 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 10 and damaged 32.  We lost eight Spitfires, but three pilots were rescued.A carrier-borne reinforcement of 31 Spitfires reached Malta on the 15th.Sea Communications.37 Wellingtons, Hudsons and Naval Albacores attacked a southboundconvoy consisting of two merchant vessels of 7,000 tons, one of 5,000 tons andthree of 3,000 tons, escorted by two destroyers and five torpedo boats, m a positionsouth of Crete Two hits with bombs are claimed on the o,000 ton vessel andon a destroyer and a near, miss on each of three other merchant vessels. further attacks were made on this convoy when it reached Tobruk.  (See paragraph 35.)Four Beaufighters attacked two small convoys of schooners and bargesbetween Sidi Barrani and Mersa Matruh.   A schooner and a barge were hit.Other Beaufighters scored many hits with cannon and machine-gun fire on three F-boats (tank landing craft) off Lampedusa. A large number of recon-reconnaissances were made by our aircraft of harbours in Sicily and Southern Italyand of Tunisian and Libyan waters.Burma.38 On the 8th, our aircraft machine-gunned locomotives at Myitkyinaand bombed the aerodrome. Many enemy casualties are reported. Two days later USA aircraft bombed a railway bridge, a factory and sidingsat Moo-aung (30 miles S.S.W. of Myitkyina). Kalewa was also attacked.Supplies were dropped each day for parties cut off and isolated in north-westBurma.Pacific Zone.39.   No major activity has been reported.   Six Hudsons attacked barracksat Dilli (Timor).  Six U.S.A. Fortresses detailed to attack Eabaul (New Britain)were intercepted by five Japanese fighters.   The bombers, two of which were-damaged, destroyed two enemy fighters and. probably destroyed another.U.S.A. Fortresses also attacked the aerodrome at Salamoa,On the 10th, 20 Japanese bombers and eight fighters attacked Port Moresby(New Guinea); two were destroyed and another was probably destroyed.   Asimilar force,  attempting to attack Port Moresby the following day, was intercepted by 12 Airacobras, two of which are missing; three enemy bombers and a fighter were destroyed and three bombers were damaged.   No damage orcasualties resulted at Port Moresby from either of these raids.Russia.40. G.A.F. operations during June and up to the present time have been almost entirely restricted to the Southern Front, with especial activity in the crimea until the fall of Sebastopol. Operations on the other fronts were localin character, but were nevertheless intensive in view of their limited scope, whichwas evidently the gaining of strategic points from which the main offensive couldbe developed. It is thought that strong air support is being given to the armoured formations by units of Fliegerkorps VIII, which was transferred fromthe Crimea to Kursk for the present offensive.The importance attached by the Germans to the operations now in progress is indicated by the concentration of so large a part of their available air strength on the Southern Front. The high degree of mobility of the G.A.F. and thecareful ground preparations that had been made is evident from the smoothnesswith which one operational command, Fliegerkorps VIII, was able to transfer and resume operations within a few days.It is estimated that at the present time some 2,500 aircraft are engaged onthe Russian Front. This, on balance, is an increase of some 100 aircraft since thebeginning of June.  The total includes about 50 Italian aircraft, mostly fighters.More than 1,400 aircraft are operating on the Southern Front, particularlyin support of the German offensive to the east of Kursk and Kharkov, a forcecomparable in size with that which operated on the Central Front against moscow in October 1941. Only relatively weak forces are operating on the remainingRussian fronts.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.41.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past weekParis.Argenteuil and Bezons. Photographs taken on 20th an&apos;d 30th June showan area of severe industrial damage, resulting from the attacks on 5th and 20thApril and 29th May, which is far in excess of the damage previously reportedin Gennevilliers. This area, which is about 1 mile by \ mile, is on the northbank of the Seine, and includes many important factories.The major part of the following three factories has been destroyed : (i) Societe Nationale de Construction des Moteurs (aero engines).
