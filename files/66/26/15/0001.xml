THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 285.July 8, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this documentVWAR CABINET.FRANCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I HAVE recently circulated to my colleagues certain information about the-feeling in France, obtained from some of our secret contacts with the forces of resistance. This information formed a useful supplement to the information which we receive from American and French sources in telegrams from HisMajesty&apos;s Representatives in Lisbon, Madrid. Tangier and Washington.2. The general effect of these reports, coming as they do from different types of Frenchmen, is to reveal the confusion which still exists in the minds ofFrenchmen, both in France itself and in North Africa. We are thus helped to fill in the picture, but it is still unfinished. Although wre can be sure that90 per cent, of the people in occupied France, and perhaps 60 per cent,in unoccupied France, are in favour of an Allied victory, we have nosufficiently reliable indication of what ideas the majority of the French peoplehold in regard to the leadership of France in the future and. the form ofgovernment which should be established after the war. It is far too early yet to hazard even an estimate.3. The policy which we have followed hitherto has been to encourage, andexpress our readiness to co-operate with, any Frenchman who stood for resistance to the Germans and wished, to work with us in order to help to achieve this. Wehave also said that it will be for the French people themselves to choose their, ownregime after the war without any interference from us. Many of them have, aswe intended, understood this to to mean that we have no intention of forcingGeneral de Gaulle on France if the French people do not want him.4. We have recognised General de Gaulle as the leader of all Free Frenchmenwho rally to him in support of the Allied cause. He does not like the description&quot;La France Libre &quot; and the Prime Minister has agreed that the Movement maym future be called &quot; La France Combattante.&quot; Our main object in agreeing tothis change of title is to show that we appreciate the symbolic value which general de Gaulle enjoys in occupied France as the leader of resistance.5. General de Gaulle is the only leader of French resistance who has emerged since the collapse, but he cannot substantiate a claim to he regarded asFrance or as the head of the Government of France. There is, in fact, no Frenchauthority to-day which can be regarded as generally representative of the french people. France was shattered at Bordeaux and it will be a long time before thePieces can be joined together again.6, General de Gaulle&apos;s failings are well known. His sudden actions can at times be dangerous.  He is intensely suspicious and, like all true Frenchmen,11785   [24076]
suffers deeply the humiliation of his country. Many of his own followers findhim just as difficult to deal with as we do. Yet, we must give him credit f0vhaving kept the flag of France flying by our side since June 1940. We have been largely responsible for building him up in France, and it is clearly impossiblefor us to drop him now. If we did, most of his chief assistants would follow his orders, and it is most unlikely that any leader would be forthcoming to take his place. His disappearance would have a bad effect on the forces of resistance inFrance, where, as numerous recent reports show, his value is growing as the recognised symbol of resistance to Germany.7. In regard to the Vichy Government, we have been unable to establishany direct relations with it since July 1940, when the French Embassy in london was withdrawn. We made two attempts during the ensuing six months, but theGermans forbade even the contact between Vichy and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwhich would be provided by our having a financial representative at Vichy. Inany case, M. Laval, who has publicly announced his ardent desire for, and confidentexpectation of, a German victory, would certainly not receive a British repre-sentative. At the request of Mr. Cordell Hulk I stated publicly on the 8th Maythat we were agreed with the policy of the United States Government in mam-taining contact with the Vichy Government. The contact has value to us. andMr. Hull had appealed for my help. We cannot go further than this, since any public support of the Vichy Government would have the effect of weakeningresistance in France which we are pledged to assist and uphold. Marshal Petain&apos;sofficial policy is collaboration with the Axis within the terms of the Armistice.His chief aim is to bring about the unity of France, and in his attempt to achieve this he has publicly declared his full confidence in M. Laval.8. The Vichy Government have at their disposal valuable cards in the shape of North Africa and the French Fleet. They have hitherto refrained fromhanding either over to the Germans, and they try to keep the latter to theArmistice terms. We must give them some credit for that, while at the same timeremembering that French public opinion acts as a useful brake on the moreardent collaborationists. But none of the utterances of the Vichy spokesmen,whether public or private, give us any grounds for hoping that the present Vichyregime would be prepared to bring France actively back into the war on our side.They may conceivably be prepared to do so when it is too late to matter much;but such a decision will be the result of the military situation existing at thetime, and not of any favours and gestures which we might show them now.9. It is not impossible that some other leader, such as General Giraud. will eventually emerge, who will enjoy greater support in France than General de gaulle and be able to challenge his position. But there is no sign of such a rivalat present. In spite of his collaborationist policy, Marshal Petain has hithertomanaged to retain the loyalty of the Generals, including General Weygand. andthere is no sign yet of any break-away, even on the part of those whom we knowto be anti-German and well-disposed to us.10. The picture is thus exceedingly confused, and the wisest policy, as I see it, for us is to continue our efforts to bring as much as possible of France and theFrench Empire back into the war at our side; to support all the forces of french resistance, wherever they may be, and whatever their allegiance, without bindingourselves exclusively to any; to continue to support General de Gaulle; and atthe same time to encourage him to strengthen his organisation by the enlistment of such representative Frenchmen as he can persuade to come over and join himBy following this policy we should at the same time be best serving the war effort and making provision for our post-war relationship with France.A.
