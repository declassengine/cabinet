THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT    2 printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECRET. - Copy. No. 29W.P. (42) 318.July 27, 1942.WAR CABINET.       /INDIA AS A FACTOR IN ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.Note by the Lord Privy Seal.THE annexed report upon Indi Sj clS 3j Factor in Anglo-American relationswas written by Mr. Graham Spry of my staff.On my way back from India I sent Mr. Spry direct from Lagos to the UnitedStates of America so that he would be available to assist in propaganda, ifnecessary.The attached report embodies his conclusions after the two months he spent in America and Canada.  I circulate it as it may be of interest to my colleagues.R. S. C.Givydyr House,Whitehall, S.W.1.India as a Factor in Anglo-American Relations.IT may be useful if I set down in summary form the conclusions formed onthis subject during the tour of the United States which I was authorised to make,partly for official and partly for personal reasons. The tour occupied the ten weeks 22nd April-30tn June, and Baltimore, New York, Washington, san francisco, Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago were visited. in washington, appointments were made for me with the President and with members of his staff and of the State Department. Through personalconnections, but also through His Majesty&apos;s Consuls and the British PressService, there were interviews or conversations with more than 100 groups ofAmericans.1. The interest of the American public in India is enduring and widespread.It varies with the stimulus of events, but it is persistent; there is almost every-where and almost at any period an audience for speakers or writers on India.That interest is not primarily founded in India as India, but in British relationswith India. If the accidents of history had made India part of the Portugueseinstead of the British Empire, there would be no comparable interest.2. British relations with India appeal to and stir American nationalism.The interest in India arises from the seeming similarity between the relations of Britain to Indian independence and of Britain to the independence of theThirteen Colonies. The superficial pattern of the relations of Britain to Indianeatly dovetails into the pattern of the American Revolution of coloniesstruggling to unite into a nation, to free themselves from the commercial restric-tions, political interference and control by Britain. The American readiness toadopt a critical attitude towards British relations with India derives not from india herself, but from the very pattern of American nationalism.[24103] *
3. American nationalism embraces at once both a sense of community anda sense of rivalry with Britain and the British Empire. The sense of communitysprings from common language, similar laws, comparable institutions, &amp;c, and sometimes identical necessities in foreign affairs. It is the manifest policy ofthe Administration to strengthen this sense. But the sense of rivalry derives from the history of revolutionary separation from Britain, and the monuments,memorials and symbols which from childhood shape the content and the conceptsof so much of American political thinking. The sense of community and the sense of rivalry are both deep-seated. Both have their emotional content. Britishrelations with India appeal to and nourish the sense of rivalry or, at its worst, of hostility towards Britain. The role of India in American opinion compares in character, though far less in degree, with the role of Ireland in American opinionthree decades ago.4. The trend of American opinion on British relations with India istowards sympathy for the more extreme and usually the Congress party points of view. The trend is almost always critical towards British policy. TheAmerican public largely holds the conviction that the Indians unitedly seekindependence, entirely deserve it and, that Britain, for her own commercial andother purposes, is withholding independence from them. Americans expect and american opinion through the press and wireless will almost certainly insist upon independence in the future. If there had been no Mission to India in 1942,there would have been some measure of such insistence.5. The Mission to India widely and. beneficially changed American opinionon British relations with India :  (a) It demonstrated that the Indian problem was not simple and that itwas more a problem within India than between Britain and India.These results will probably be lasting.(&amp;) The American public generally approved of the Draft Proposals andfelt that the Indian political leaders should have accepted them. Theintransigence of Congress, and particularly of Mr. Gandhi, adverselyinfluenced the position of both in the United States. But to AmericansCongress is the champion, the voice of the whole of India, and, to alarge extent, Congress so remains. To this the very name Congresscontributes. The Mission to India will remain as a promise of inde-pendence clearly given and to that extent the proposals will continueto command at least intelligent American opinion. But the secularpressure of American nationalist attitudes will weaken the friendlyfeeling so evoked and stimulate criticism of British policy.(c) The policy of the various information departments of the AmericanGovernment is being directed towards increasing friendship with britain and knowledge of her imperial, including Indian, problems.But some suspicion was met in official circles that a settlement inIndia was made impossible in the final stages of the negotiations bynew or revised instructions from the War Cabinet. A question onthis point was raised in a friendly tone by the President in the interview with him, and in more emphatic terms by one of his executive assistants and by officers of the State Department. Theinterpretation was emphatically denied and the denial was accepted.6. The role of India in Anglo-American relations is not of first significance,but at a moment of tension it could so become. It remains, however, a permanentfactor in the complex of factors that determine American feelings, favourable orunfavourable, towards Britain. As such a factor, it is primarily a subject of anglo-American relations; the views of Americans about India are essentiallypart of the views of Americans about Britain. Therefore, the responsibility forinformation and propaganda about British relations with India, though notnecessarily about India, should be the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government.There is so little knowledge of British relations with India, so many and suchdeep-rooted misconceptions of the Indian question in the United States, that Iam led to state with emphasis that this responsibility seems not to have been adequately borne.   It should be so borne.
