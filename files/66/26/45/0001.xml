THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 315.Jidy 25, 1942.-TO-BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.AIR SERVICE TO THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN connection with the report of the A d Hoc Committee, dated the 29th June,1942 (W.P. (42) 275), I wish to draw attention to several factors which have arisen since the report was written.2. Experimental flights with the Whitleys mentioned in paragraph 3 of theReport have proved that, for technical reasons, these aircraft are unable to operate in the tropical conditions on the United Kingdom-West Africa and theUnited Kingdom-Egypt routes. As regards the Liberators, only three were until recently on the regular service to the Middle East, although I anticipated that fivewould be in service by the beginning of June. A fourth has now been added, anda fifth, which replaced one shot down, is now being modified in Canada.3. In my memorandum of 18th March (Misc. (42) 19/2), I said that Iintended to allocate in addition a number of Liberator Mark IITs for usebetween the United Kingdom and Bathurst, and that I was aiming at 5 initially.I have now arranged with.the Ministry of Aircraft Production that ten of these aircraft shall be converted for transport purposes. They will not have thenecessary range to operate to West Africa, but I hope to employ them on theNorth Atlantic, from which route it should then be possible to release a numberof the longer-range type of Liberator for use on the Middle East service. Itwill, however, be some time before these new Liberators are ready for service.4. The actual figures of loads carried each week up to the end of Mayare given in the annex to the report of the Ad Hoc Committee. The figuressince the beginning of June, when the target figure rose to 14,000-ibs., areas follows : WeeklyTotal in lbs.    average in lbs.Week ended 6th JuneWeek ended 13th JuneWeek ended 20th JuneWeek ended 27th JuneWeek ended 4th JulyWeek ended 11th July5.   It will be seen that the results I ventured to forecast in my memorandumof  18th  March  have  so  far  been  achieved.    This  has  become   possiblenot so much by the provision of additional aircraft as by overworking theexisting fleet.   On the West Africa route, for instance, valuable service has[24148]Copy No.19,76111,9139,07813,97014,68515,02014,327
been rendered by the obsolescent S.30 flying boats, but I cannot promise that their recent high performance can be maintained. Moreover, the three Boeings areliable to be diverted, from time to time, for special nights, with a consequent lossof carrying capacity to West Africa. This amounted, in fact, to 26,000 lbs. inthirteen weeks. The service to the Middle East may be jeopardised by militarydevelopments in Egypt and regularity of operation will decline with the return of winter.6. The military situation in the Middle East has greatly increased the loads(particularly spare parts for tanks and aircraft) which require urgent conveyanceto Egypt, and this will increase rather than diminish.&apos;7. The air service to the Middle East is under constant review, and I willcontinue to make such improvements as I can, having regard to the means at mydisposal and the many calls on the limited equipment available.A. H. M. S.July 25, 1942.
