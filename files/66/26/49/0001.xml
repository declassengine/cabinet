QUESTION:Y/hat arc the present intentions of His Majesty1^ Government as regardsthe political situation in India ?ANSWER.The Congress Party y/orking Committee has adopted, subject to ratification by the All-India Committee, a resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal ofBritish rule from India, and threatening a mass movement if the demand is notconceded.The purpose of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the constitutionalfuture of India was made clear in the draft Declaration which Sir Stafford CrippsCD.-was authorised to offer on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   /For reasons insome cases mutually destructive/It proved impossible to secure the support of the- (bprincipal elements of India&apos;s national life for thc/jspecificTproposals in that declaration, and the draft was accordingly withdrawn.     Nevertheless HisMajesty&apos;s Government stand firmly by the broad intention of their offer which isthat on the conclusion of hostilities India shall have it within her power to attain to complete self-government through such method of arriving at a constitutional solution and under such form of government as may be agreed among themselves by the principal elements in Indian national life.The present demand of Congress completely ignores this far-reaching offer and v/ould, if conceded, bring about a complete and abrupt dislocation of thevast and complicated machinery of government in India.     This at a time when inRussia, China, Libya and other theatres of war the situation calls for theundivided energy, co-operation and concentration of the resources of all theAllied powers.     No greater dis-service to the cause for which the United nations are fighting can be imagined, and men of goodwill everywhere must refuse to envisage such a catastrophic development in one of the most vital theatres of war.His Majesty&apos;s Government while reiterating their resolve to/bring aboutj &apos; the attainment by India 5T her most cherished desires/cannot but solemnly warnall those who stand behind the policy adumbrated by the Working Committee of congress/(?)

Congress that the Government of India will not flinch from their duty to take every possible step to neet the situation.     The United Nations have bentthemselves to the task of fighting the nenace which overhangs civilisation,* A */i tuc &amp; *hand of creating a new world Order in v/hichjIndia nust inevitably play a great part and it is the earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the indian people will lend no countenance to a movement fraught with such disastrous consequences but will on the contrary, setting aside their politicaldifferences for the moment; throw their-all into the struggle -against thecorxion enemies of mankind.
