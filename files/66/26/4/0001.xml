THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s/gOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  June 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 274.June 29, 1942.WAR CABINET.&quot; FRONT LINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THIS pamphlet will tell the enemy about the effects, moral and material,of every important raid on this country and about our counter-measures.2. It shows that attacks on selected industrial targets on R.A.F. lines yieldthe best dividend a lesson the enemy has not yet learned, witness the raids ofthe last two nights on Weston-super-Mare and the recent &quot; Baedeker &quot; raids.3. We have paid for earlier indiscretions. We said it was easy to put outincendiary bombs; so the enemy put explosive in them. We advertised the havocwhen sea-mines fell on Clacton; so he brought the land-mine into use.4. Admittedly, the pamphlet would be good propaganda. It is for theWar Cabinet to decide whether this outweighs the risk of helping the enemy tomake better plans for his bomber offensive in the autumn.5. If the pamphlet is published and the enemy&apos;s attacks are thenconcentrated in force on industrial targets, we shall be blamed for pointingthe way.6. In any case, we shall have a disgruntled Press, because the pamphlet&quot; scoops &quot; material previously held back on security grounds.. A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, June 29, 1942.\JL Arf fa?) 27c[24020]
