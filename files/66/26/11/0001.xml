NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   There have been no outstanding events at sea during the week.Shipping losses, principally due to U-boat attacks in the Western Atlantichave been heavy.Home Waters.2. Early on the 1st July three M.G.Bs. attacked three escorted north-boundmerchant ships off the Texel and inflicted considerable damage. Two of theM.G.Bs. were slightly damaged and there were four minor casualties.Mediterranean.3. On the 30th May H.M. Submarine Proteus while on patrol in the gulf of Sidra torpedoed and probably sank a 2,500-ton laden merchant ship, and onthe following day sank a heavily laden ammunition ship of 6,000 tons.On the 30th June H.M.S. Medway (submarine depot ship) was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat while on passage from Alexandria to Haifa. There were about 100 casualties; 1,105 survivors were rescued.During the week approximately 14,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft and a number of other ships were probably damaged by near misses.32,859 tons of French merchant shipping westbound and 17,275 tons east-bound have passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.Anti-Submarine Operations.4. A U-boat was attacked by torpedo and probably sunk by ELM. SubmarineP. 34 south of Crete on the 24th June. Sixteen other attacks, ten of them by aircraft and six by surface craft, have been reported during the week, but in no case was there definite evidence of destruction. Of these attacks, eleven weremade off the east coast of North America, four in the Caribbean area and onenorth-west of Cape Finisterre. Fourteen of these attacks were carried out by united States forces.Enemy Intelligence.German.5. There is no change in the dispositions of main units. The two pocketbattleships are in the Narvik area and the battleship Tirpitz and the cruiserHipper at Trondheim.At the present time there are 16 destroyers and 31 torpedo boats in commission.Italian.6. The Littorio class battleship which was damaged by torpedo attack hasbeen seen by air reconnaissance in dry dock at Taranto. On the 27th recon-naissance of Brindisi showed that the uncompleted battleship Impero was nolonger in port.Enemy Occupied Ports in North Africa.7. Tobruk. All lighters were removed from Tobruk before the enemy occupation and the floating crane was destroyed. The enemy has now broughtfour lighters and some other small craft, and it is estimated that 6-800 tons aday could be unloaded by means of these It would be possible to increase this rate to 2,000 tons a day if adequate lighters were provided.Bardia. No lighters are now present and all the jetties were destroyed the estimated capacity of the port when facilities have been improved is 1,000tons a day.Solhim. There is no information as to the demolitions undertaken atSollum but a substantial stone-built breakwater exists, alongside which shipsup to 1,700 tons can lie.   The estimated capacity of the port is 600 tons a day.
Mersa Matruh-Mersn Matruh has not been used as a port during thepresent war but ships of 1,000 tons might be unloaded by putting a lighterbetween the ship and the shore. The estimated capacity of the port in favourable circumstances is 200 tons a day.Japanese.8. The force operating in the Aleutian area is probably composed of twobattleships, four aircraft carriers, four seaplane carriers, nine cruisers and alarge number of destroyers and U-boats. Apart from this force practicallythe whole effective strength of the Navy is concentrated in Home WatersInformation has been received that the cruisers of the Mogami class, which werefitted out ostensibly as 6-inch cruisers, now mount ten 8-inch guns and it isconsidered probable that the Tone class cruisers mount eight 8-inch guns.U-boats.9. Activity continues in the Western Atlantic particularly in the gulf of Mexico and m the approaches to New York. U-boats have been operating in the Levant. r        toA U-boat has been sighted to the west of Capetown otherwise there hasbeen no evidence of U-boats in the South Atlantic.Japanese U-boats are operating in the Mozambique Channel and one hasbeen reported near New Zealand.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending midnight 28th/29th June 1,204 ships,including 337 Allied and 19 neutral, have been convoyed. Of these 274 ships were in ocean convoys, 903 in British coastal convoys and 27 in Western atlantic convoys. Four ocean convoys consisting of 139 ships arrived in Home waters without loss from enemy action. One anti-aircraft ship, 70 destroyers (includingfour United States destroyers) and 98 sloops, cutters, corvettes and fleet mine-sweepers were employed on escort duty. Since the beginning of the war 558ships have been lost out of 122,989 ships which have been convoyed.The first convoys to St. Johns, Newfoundland, sailed from Halifax on the29th June.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending 27th June totalled 824,000 tons compared with 774,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 646,000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 204,500 tons were oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. Twenty-three ships, of which ten are known to have sunk, are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during the week. Twelve ships were torpedoed in the Caribbean and adjacent waters, five off the United States ofAmerica eastern seaboard, one in mid-Atlantic and two in the eastern mediterranean. Two ships were shelled by a U-boat in the MozambiqueChannel and one ship was attacked east of Zanzibar. One ship was sunk by aircraft attack in the Eastern Mediterranean.Reports received up to the 30th June show that 105 ships totalling 550,000tons and including 32 tankers were sunk by U-boats (including mines laid by -boats) in U.S.A. waters during the month. Twelve of these ships were sunk in convoy. Ten ships which were torpedoed or shelled have reached port. The fate of some 20 other ships attacked is not yet known and 11 ships are overdue.British Minelaying.12. Mines have been laid by surface craft in the East Coast Barrage andoft the French coast. Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out in the Biscayarea and, to a less extent, off the German North Sea coast.
Since the beginning of the war the following enemy naval losses have beenattributed to mines :- German Baltic, Kattegat and. Norway 2 E-boats.4 minelayers.6 minesweepers.Heligoland Bight, German and Dutch Coasts 2 destroyers.2 barrage breakers.5 minesweepers.Belgian and French Coasts 1 destroyer.1 torpedo boat.2 E-boats.1 barrage breaker.3 minesweepers.Italian Mediterranean 1 minelayer.1 destroyer.2 torpedo-boats.Some 24 named enemy merchant ships have been reported as mine casualtiesbetween the 1st January and 31st May, 1942.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. On one night during the week enemy aircraft may have been minelayingin the Bristol Channel. Early in the morning of the 1st July three E-Boats,probably minelaying off Hastings, were driven off by two of our M.Ls.Sixty-three magnetic and five acoustic mines have been destroyed chiefly offthe East Coast. The mine totals are : 2,345 magnetic, 1,301 acoustic and 1,373moored.Foreign Waters.Although sweeping at Malta was practically impossible in daylight during may owing to enemy air raids, 46 mines were destroyed in the Grand Harbourapproaches between 8th May and 12th June. Before the arrival of the convoy from Gibraltar, extensive searches were carried out and a nest of mines andobstructions was found and destroyed about 5^ miles south-east of the harbourentrance. Eight mines were destroyed by the fleet sweepers ahead of the convoy.Between 8th May and 28th June, 65 mines were destroyed by local sweepers, 42 byfleet sweepers and seven by other ships.The Egyptian salvage tug Pharos was mined and sunk off Alexandria on29th June.Three enemy mines have been washed ashore near Cape Town.Enemy  mines,   presumably  laid  by  U-boats,   have  been   reported offSan Francisco, and sweeping is in progress.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15. The Italian tankers Albaro (2,104 tons) and Celen-o (3,741 tons) sailed from Istanboul for the Piraeus on the 26th June fully laden.The Italian s.s. Semien (6,942 tons), which is at Dakar, has been transferredto the Swiss flag and renamed Lugano.  She will probably sail for Lisbon shortly.vichy Merchant Shipping.16. Of the 30 Vichy merchant ships, totalling 112,389 tons, excluding smallcoasters, which were known to be in Far Eastern waters when Japan entered the war, 11 ships, of 79,419 tons, are now believed to be in Japanese service.
MILITARY SITUATION.Egypt.-25th June.17. The enemy continued his eastward advance and by nightfall his forward troops were reported to be 20 miles west of Matruh to the north of the coast road.The dispositions of his main forces were as follows : (a) Northern column on the coast road about 40 miles west of Matruhconsisting of approximately 1,500 M.T. with guns.(6) Centre column astride the railway about 40 miles west of Matruhconsisting of 2/3,000 M.T. with some tanks supported by a furthercolumn of M.T. 20 miles to the west of the main concentration; and(c) Southern column containing large numbers of M.T. and tanks advancingon a broad front towards Bir Kanayis.26th June.18. Our mobile forces and battle.groups continued to engage the enemy and delay his advance. The enemy made further progress and by nightfall had reached the general line of the track Matruh-Siwa. His forces on the southernflank were delayed by our motorised columns, but our main forces had not yetbeen engaged.During the evening the enemy closed on the Matruh position from the coastto the escarpment. Some 15 miles to the south the German armoured divisionspassed through our newly laid mine fields in the centre of the position and were engaged by our mobile battle groups. A force of about 45 Italian tanks were engaged by our armour some 5 miles south-west of Sidi Hamza while our lightarmoured forces attacked the rear of enemy columns moving north-east along the track Matruh-Siwa near Bir Kanayis.27th June.19. The enemy, who had concentrated a force in the Sidi Hamza-MinquarQaim area, was engaged throughout the day by all formations of the eighth army. Our infantry opposed the enemy&apos;s eastward thrust and attacked hisnorthern flank, while our armoured and motorised forces operated further westagainst his southern flank and rear. The general trend of movement continued in an easterly and south-easterly direction.28lh June.20. By morning the Italians had concentrated the bulk of their forces tothe west and south of Matruh while advanced elements of the German forcesfurther west were thrusting eastwards and had reached a point south of Bagush.Enemy forces were also encountered south of the coast road 10 miles west of Fuka.Our forces continued their delaying tactics on the southern flank. During the night it was decided to withdraw from Matruh along the coast road to Fuka.29th June.21. Operations centred on giving all possible assistance to the withdrawalof the Matruh Garrison. During the course of the day the enemy continuedhis eastward movement and was opposed vigorously by our forces. Sixty percent, of the Matruh Garrison was reported on the 30th to be safe behind theEl Alamein position.30th June.. 22. By the morning German forces appeared to have reached a point 20miles east of Daba. No major enemy attack develqped against our forces duringthe day, and re-organisation and re-adjustment continued in the El Alameinposition. Our armoured units operated to the west of the main position anda number of enemy tanks were destroyed.1st July.23.   During the morning of the 1st July an attack by German and italian forces supported by tanks on our defended localitv at El Alamein was repulsed[24054] c
In the afternoon the enemy attacked another of our defended localities about15 miles south-south-west of Alamein. Some of their tanks penetrated ourlines but the position was restored by a counter-attack. Later in the eveninghowever the enemy increased their pressure; using between 50 and 60 tanksthey succeeded in overrunning the position. Early on the 2nd, there were sio^that a general attack on El Alamein was developing.Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.24. The Germans appear finally to have destroyed, after several months&apos;fighting, a considerable Russian force that had established itself across theRiver Volkhov north of Lake Ilmen.Southern Sector.25. The Germans have launched an offensive in the Kursk area. details are still lacking, but a possible object of the thrust might be the capture ofVoronezh and the severing of communications between Moscow and the south.East and south-east of Kharkov a fresh attack on the 22nd forced the russians to abandon the town of Kupyansk and to retire behind the River Oskol fromKupyansk southward to the Donets. Since then there has been a lull in operations in this sector.Crimea. -26. The German claim to have captured Sevastopol on 1st July isprobably substantially correct.Summary.27. With the launching of the attack in the area of Kursk, the mainGerman offensive may now have begun. Had weather been the only consideration,the offensive might have been begun in early May, but continued Russian pressureduring the winter and spring, kept the German forces engaged and lengthenedthe period of preparation necessary for a renewal of offensive operations. the offensive may also have been held up by the. prolonged Russian resistance atSevastopol, the elimination of which appeared necessary for the staging of anycombined operations across the Black Sea.&quot; Now that the Germans have beguntheir offensive later than was either intended or is, from their point of view,desirable lack of overwhelming superiority in air strength and armoured force is likely to force them to concentrate on comparatively narrow fronts.The thrust in the area of Kursk is no doubt only a part of the offensive, andis likely to be combined with further thrusts east of Kharkov, and fromTaganrog.India.28. Japanese inactivity continues on the Assam-Burma frontier. Thereare indications that they are withdrawing from Homalin, possibly to avoidmalaria.South Pacific.29. United States reinforcements despatched in April bring the strengthof the garrison in the Samoan group to 13,580 all ranks. These forces aredistributed between Tutuila, west Samoa and Wallis Island.Intelligence.Turkey.30. There are indications that Headquarters have recently been formed for an XVIII Corps, which is destined to take over two divisions on the easternBlack Sea coast. The formation of a division at Zonguldak and the measuresrecently taken against parachutists in the Giresun vilayet, suggests a growingawareness of the vulnerability of Turkey&apos;s Black Sea coast.
Far East.31. It is reported that five Japanese transports were expected at Dilli,capital of Portuguese Timor. These reinforcements are a tribute to the gallantguerilla activities of Australians and Dutch detachments in that territory.AIR SITUATION.General.32. A very heavy attack on Bremen was followed by two further raids onthe same port.Our aircraft in Egypt provided full support for our land forces.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.United Kingdom.33.   Fighter Command flew 871 defensive sorties by day and 471 by night.Enemy activity against this country by day was very slight.At night, five attacks were made by an average of about 30 aircraft. Themain targets were Weston-super-Mare, which was bombed on two consecutivenights, and Norwich.Seven enemy aircraft were destroyed and seven were damaged.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.34. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 776 and 29 sorties respectively, compared with 1,082 and 59 last week.Bostons bombed Havre docks in weather which precluded the observationof results; photographic assessment of the damage caused is shown at appendix VII. The rail centre at Hazebrouck was the target on anotheroccasion; buildings near the aiming-point and railway tracks nearby were hit.Thirty-seven squadron sorties were flown by Fighter Command in supportof these two attacks. In the ensuing combats, four enemy fighters were destroyed, another probably destroyed, and eight more damaged. Six of ourswere shot down.Night,35. Bomber Command made 1,400 aircraft sorties against land targets,compared with 661 last week. About 2,100 tons of bombs were dropped duringthe period under review.The objective on three nights was Bremen, on which a total of 643 tons ofH.E. and 1,210 tons of incendiary bombs were dropped. Heavy cloud obscured the target on each occasion, but photographs secured later disclose considerabledestruction (see Appendix VII, page 13).On the first of these nights (25th-26th June), 1,105 aircraft drawn fromBomber, Fighter, Coastal and Army Co-operation Commands were despatchedWhile the main attack was in progress against Bremen, a part of this forceattacked aerodromes in Germany and occupied territory. The two subsequentraids on Bremen involved 165 and 283 bombers respectively. From these opera-tions 72 of our aircraft did not return. Seven enemy fighters were shot down,three of them falling to one Stirling. Another enemy aircraft was probably destroyed.Our &quot; Intruder &quot; operations involved 113 sorties; at least eight locomotiveswere disabled in occupied territory and a gas works was set on fire near Elbeuf.Four enemy aircraft were destroyed, and others damaged.Coastal.. 36.   Coastal Command flew 538 sorties, 41 of which were on convoy escort,shipping-protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 967 sorties.During anti-shipping operations by Hurricanes off the French coast, a1,000-ton ship is believed to have been sunk; a 4,000-ton vessel and at least fourE-boats were damaged.[24054] D
Off Borkum, torpedo attacks by Hudsons were made on a convoy of three ships of about 4,500 tons, one of which was severely damaged and set on fire.Sixty-nine aircraft of Bomber Command laid 164 sea-mines in enemy watersMediterranean.Egypt and Libya.37. Throughout the week our aircraft continuously bombed and machine-gunned landing grounds, gun positions, M.T. columns and troop concentrationsin the battle area. On the 26th 576 sorties were flown, which is a record numberfor one day.Many fires and explosions were started among enemy tanks and M.T., and several aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground. Direct hits were claimed on an enemy mobile headquarters.Our fighters flew a large number of reconnaissances and strong offensive patrols over the battle area.Shipping and harbour facilities at Tobruk were bombed on four nights by liberators and Wellingtons, causing explosions and fires. Mines were laid in the harbour.Enemy long-range bombers from Greece and Crete made night attacks on ourlanding grounds and on the railway line between El Daba and Burg El Arab.Our communications and troops between the forward area and Alexandria were bombed by forces of 10 to 20 aircraft. On the night 29th/30th eight aircraftdropped mines in Alexandria Harbour and on land.In these operations 17 enemy aircraft were destroyed by our fighters, two were probably destroyed and eight were damaged.   We lost 36 aircraft.Gibraltar.38. On the night the 28th/29th June about eight enemy aircraft, believedItalian, attacked the harbour area and the North Front aerodrome. One of our aircraft was destroyed on the ground, and two were damaged.Malta.39. Enemy activity against the Island was again on a small scale. A totalof about 250 enemy aircraft, mainly fighters, attacked the Island.Bombs were dropped on the aerodromes at Ffal Far and Luqa.&apos; Four of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground and six were damaged.Our fighters destroyed 17 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed five and damaged 13.  We lost two Spitfires.Sea Communications.40. Eight Wellingtons, five of which carried torpedoes, attacked&apos;a convoy,consisting of three 6,000-ton merchant vessels escorted by four destroyers, in theGulf of Taranto. One merchant vessel was hit by two torpedoes, and near misseswith bombs were scored on the other two. After the attack a part of the convoyreturned to Taranto.Other bombers torpedoed a 5,000-ton merchant vessel and set fire to another of 3,000 tons east of Tobruk. A barge off the Libyan coast was set on fire by fighters.Near misses were scored on three merchant vessels (two of 6,000 tons andone of 2,000 tons), on a 7,000-ton tanker, on a destroyer south of Taranto, andon a 3,000-ton merchant vessel east of Bomba.A large number of reconnaissances were made by our aircraft of harbours and aerodromes in Sicily and Southern Italy, and of Sardinian and Sicilianwaters.Russia.41. On the 30th there was a heavy raid on Murmansk, and a further large area of the town is reported to have been burnt out.No information has been received about air operations on other parts of theRussian front.
pacific Zone.42. Allied aircraft bombed objectives at Salamoa (four times), Lae (four times), Dilli, Tulagi and aerodromes near Rabaul.Eighteen Japanese bombers, escorted by 11 fighters, made an ineffectiveraid on Seven Miles aerodrome, Port Moresby. Thirteen Allied fighters inter-cepted this attack and four of them are missing.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.43. The only incident was on the 26th when two enemy aircraft attackedBrighton with cannon fire, destroying a gasometer.By Night.44. On the night of the 26th/27th there was a sharp attack on Norwich.Incendiaries caused a number of fires, of which six reached serious proportions.One hundred and fifty houses were demolished and 2,000 damaged. The Norfolkand Norwich Hospital was evacuated. The Thorpe Station and Goods Yardwere damaged.   The Cathedral received slight damage to the roof.On the 27th/28th the main enemy attack was on Weston-Super-Mare.Damage was caused chiefly to residential property. Incidents also occurred atWeymouth and Axminster.On the 28th/29th, Weston-Super-Mare was again bombed. Many fires were started, the main shopping centre being chiefly affected. The G.W.R. loop line was blocked, operation being maintained by a shuttle service. considerable damage was caused at the main railwajr station and goods yard.On the 29th/30th there was scattered bombing over parts of East Angliaand the East Midlands. Damage at Peterborough was caused to raihvay property,hotels and a clothing factory. At King&apos;s Lynn, the King Edward VII Schoolsuffered considerable damage by fire.On the lst/2nd July there was some scattered bombing in Devonshire, Dorsetand Somerset.
