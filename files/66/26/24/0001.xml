this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.Sf RKT.  &apos; y Copy No.w p. (42) 294.July 14, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.THE SHIPPING SITUATION.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE Committee appointed in May to keep the shipping situation underreview (W.P. (42) 192) have now submitted their first Report (W.P. (42) 293)reviewing shipping requirements over the period of eighteen months from thebeginning of 1942 to the end of June, 1943.On the assumptions set out in paragraph 3 of their Report they estimate that during this period non-tanker imports will total 35 million tons, of which33 million tons will be imports of food and materials. If consumption policyremains unchanged, the net consumption of importable food and materialsduring this period will total 41-4 million tons. There is thus a deficiency of8-4 million tons.2. The Committee set out in their Report the measures which might haveto be taken to close this gap if no further assistance were forthcoming from theUnited States and the deficiency had to be met wholly from our own resources.The import savings represented by these measures may be summarised asfollows : De-stocking. Million tons.Running down stocks of food and raw materials  ...       ...       6-15Consumption economies: Food. Tons.Increased food yield from 1942 harvest      ...       500.000Raising milling ratio to 90 per cent.......       150,000Dilution of bread by rye, barley and oats ... 560,000Reduction of the reserve of meat on the hoof ...       100,000Consumption economies: Raw Materials.Cut in imports of fertilizers, at the expense ofthe 1943 harvest............ 400,000Economies in steel and steel-making materials 400,000Economies in materials other than&quot;steel     ... 200,0001-31100These measures would, close the gap, without taking into, account such further savings as could be secured by economies in the use of shipping for military purposes and for civil imports to territories other than the United Kingdom[24092]
3. The Lord Presidents Committee agree that, without additionalAmerican assistance, the prospects of our shipping situation over the nexteighteen months wouid indeed be grave. If we were compelled to meet this situation wholly from our own resources, the drastic measures of retrenchmentwhich we should be forced to take might damage national morale and limit our capacity to carry on the war with full vigour and efficiency. Moreover, theadoption of these measures would reduce us by mid-1943 to a condition in which our stocks of food and materials would be so far diminished that we should be unable to carry on the war without a measure of American assistance far in excessof any on wrhich we have hitherto been able to rely. Stocks would have been rundown to a point at which it would become essential to raise the rate of importsfrom 9-i- million tons in the first half of 1943 to 15 million tons in the second halfof that&quot; year and for this sharp expansion of importing capacity we shouldhave to rely almost entirely on American shipping.4. It would be a mistaken policy, from the point of view of the common interests of the United Nations, to postpone an increase in the allocation to thiscountry of new shipping from American yards until we had reached a point atwhich our capacity to carry on the war effectively was seriously jeopardised.In these circumstances my Committee consider that the situation should, ifpossible, be met on the lines contemplated in paragraphs 21-24 of the Report ofthe Shipping Committee i.e., by a substantial increase in American assistancein the first, as well as the second, half of 1943, combined with measures ofretrenchment (running down stocks, and reducing consumption, of importedfood and raw materials) which, though substantial, will be less drastic thanthose which we should have to adopt if the prospective deficiency in importing capacity had to be met wholly by these means.5. My Committee have reviewed the possible measures discussed by theShipping Committee for reducing our consumption of imports. They feel thatsome of these measures would dislocate our economy to an extent which wouldnot be justified in present circumstances. They could not recommend at this juncture (a) The use of barley as a diluent in bread, at the cost of reducing beersupplies by half;(&amp;) the reduction of the reserve of meat on the hoof;(c) any cut in imports of fertilizers at the expense of the 1943 harvest.Further, they doubt whether the relatively small saving in wheat imports wouldoutweigh the disadvantages of increasing the milling ratio beyond 85%. Inany event they would not favour an increase above 90%.The remaining measures suggested by the Shipping Committee might beexpected to produce savings in imports of food amounting to a maximum of some800,000 tons.As regards imported materials consumption economies to the extent of about600,000 tons could be secured without serious prejudice to direct war production though the cuts involved would fall very heavily on services supplying civilneeds.Stocks might perhaps be reduced by 4 million tons, in place of the 6-15million tons contemplated by the Shipping Committee.There is no prospect of any substantial saving in civil imports to territoriesother than the United Kingdom. Some relief might be obtained through further economies in the use of shipping for military purposes; but the Lord presidents committee are not in a position to frame any quantitative estimate of the savings to be secured by this means.It is clear, however, that, even though we make these substantial reductions in our demands on shipping and enforce every economy in our use of the shipsavailable, we cannot hope to meet the prospective deficiency unless we can obtain from the United States assistance enabling us to bring in something not far short of an additional 3 million tons of imports before the middle of 1943. If assistance on this scale is not forthcoming we may reach the point at which it will become impossible to meet in full the urgent needs of the fighting Services for shippingwithout reducing imports below the minimum level required to maintain our war production and to supply our essential civilian requirements.
Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 14, 1942.Large as is the planned output of United States new construction, theirnresent high rate of shipping losses may not be reduced for some time, whiledemands on shipping involved in bringing United States troops to Europe arelikely to be extremely large. In the absence, therefore, of some firm assurance from the United States Government, it is not safe to assume that they will be ablet0 provide assistance of the proportions required.6.   My Committee therefore submit the following recommendations : (a) The facts of the shipping situation should be strongly represented to theUnited States Government. It should be made clear that, from ourown resources and with the American help already available, we cannotmeet the prospective deficiency in importing capacity without adopting a policy of retrenchment which would seriously impair our ability tocarry on the war after the middle of 1943. American assistance willin any event be required on a substantial scale in the second half of1943. But in the common interests of the United Nations as a wholeit is preferable that we should receive in the early part of 1943 sucha measure of assistance as will enable us to keep stocks and consump-tion at reasonable levels and thus obviate the need for a much steeperincrease of imports in the second half of that year.For these reasons the United States authorities should be pressed to increase the tonnage of shipping to be allocated in the first half of1943 to areas for which we are responsible. We should make everyeffort to obtain firm assurances regarding the tonnage which can bemade available during the whole of next year. It should be sufficientto enable us to bring in at least 3 million tons of imports during thefirst half of that year.(&amp;) The extent to which stocks, and consumption, of imported food and materials will have to be reduced in order to close the remaining aaocannot be calculated with precision until we know what additionalshipping can be made available to us from American production.Provisional plans should, however, be prepared on the assumption thatimport economies totalling about 51 million tons will have to be securedover the period of eighteen months up to the end of June 1943. Certaineconomies in consumption of imports may have to be introducedforthwith.(c) Every practicable economy must be secured in the use of the availableshipping. The Shipping Committee are making further enquiries into this aspect of the problem: and in consultation with the Ministerof War Transport they will review all the possible means of securing a more economical use of the ships engaged in supplying civil andmilitary requirements.If, however, any substantial reduction is to be secured in thedemand upon shipping for military purposes, it will be necessary tobring under review matters (e.g., scales of maintenance and reserves)which raise issues of military policy outside the competence of theShipping Committee. These aspects of the problem will, no doubt, beconsidered by the Defence Committee with a view to the issue ofsuitable Directives to the Service Departments.J. A.
