MOST SECRET.MALAYA AND SINGAPORE.1. Introduction.THE dramatic suddenness of Singapore&apos;s fall has naturally monopolisedattention at the expense of the Malaya campaign as a whole and the capitula-tion is commonly regarded as an isolated episode divorced from the events of thetwo months preceding it. Responsibility is being attributed recklessly to individuals and undue importance attached to minor factors; the resultantconfusion has been heightened by the difficulty of obtaining information fromthose best qualified to give it. However, even from the incomplete facts now available it is possible to form definite opinions on major aspects of the campaign.The first is that by November 1941 the situation in Malaya already containedmany of the elements of disaster. It would appear that our plans were based on some factors which had ceased to be operative, and that the significance of otherevents, such as the control of French Indo-China and Thailand by the japanese and Russia&apos;s entry into the war, had not been given due weight. Yet Japan&apos;snew acquisitions increased the danger of an attack from the North, whileRussia would be receiving equipment, and particularly aircraft, intended forMalaya.The general feeling of security evident in Malaya at this time was based onthe view, expressed officially by specialists, that Japan was most unlikely to riskhostilities with Britain and the United States simultaneously. In addition, the rapid increase of the number of aerodromes naturally suggested an increase inthe air strength, and it was, in fact, officially announced that an attemptedJapanese invasion from the sea would be frustrated by air action. This forecastmay have been based on the date of arrival of extra aircraft before the Japanesecould undertake landings on the East Coast.Landings in this area were considered impracticable during the prevalence of the north-eastern monsoon, i.e., from December to the end of February; whenthe enemy seized Kota Bahru from the sea between the 6th and 10th december and launched at the same time a large-scale offensive on the West Coast, our programme of preparation was seriously disorganised.The local press, by consistently disparaging the quality of the enemy&apos;s airforce, and otherwise showing a poor opinion of his general efficiency, helped tobuild up a dangerously complacent attitude, and in Malaya ease and complacencyflourish without outside assistance.Though there were some specialists who distrusted this attitude, it is noexaggeration to say that from the Governor downwards, among civil servants and soldiers alike, there was a general belief that, at the best, there would probablybe no war with Japan; at the worst, that they would make no move untilFebruary 1942.In the face of this dangerous situation our plan was indefinite. It was hoped that a limited surprise offensive into Thailand would secure for us Singoraand the important rail junction of Hatyai, thereby holding up the enemy for aconsiderable period. As an alternative, a defensive position was under prepara-tion at Jitra, in North-West Kedah. It was due to be completed in February1942. - Further South a second position had been chosen at Gurun, but littlework had been done at the commencement of hostilities.On the East Coast an elaborate system of beach defences had been carriedout in the Kota Bahru area, and a  Kuantan, but it was admitted that the 8thand 22nd Indian Infantry Brigades lacked the strength both to man pill-boxesand provide adequate reserves. This weakness was, however, offset by the assurance that landings would be broken up by air action.Though not strong enough to man the long perimeter of Singapore Island,the Fortress troops, with the aid of very strong defences, were in a position todeal with attempted landings from seawrards.
The Japanese problem was mainly one of time to hit with superior strengthinitially and to maintain such pressure as would carry him to the southern endof the peninsula before adequate reinforcements could be despatched to singapore. Simultaneously, captured aerodromes would be used to increaseprogressively the effect of air superiority, until a point was reached wherecommunications between Singapore and the mainland would be disorganised andthe Naval Base itself closed. Meanwhile, systematic long-range bombing of thetown would pave the way for a breakdown of morale.As an Asiatic Power, maintaining a European standard of efficiency, and atthe same time operating on Asiatic soil, the Japanese had a great initialadvantage, apart from almost complete command in the air, greatly superiornumbers on the ground, and tanks. In addition, and unexpectedly, the Japanesegained freedom for their convoys at sea by destroying our two capital ships.It was soon clear that this campaign had been planned in detail, troopsspecially trained for it, and best types of equipment provided. The inhabitantsin the mass were, at best, a hindrance to us at the worst, a help to the enemy.Japanese topographical knowledge was exact and up-to-date, and his day-to-dayinformation of our movements very complete.2. Outline of Operations on the Mainland.On 6th December, 1941, a large Japanese convoy was observed steaming intothe Gulf of Siam; on the night 6th/7th iandings were effected at Singora, Patani,in South Thailand, and at Kota Bahru, in North-East of Kalantan.Singapore was bombed for the first time in the early hours of 8th December.On the west coast, in North Kedah, 11 Division were at this period stilluncertain which role they would be called on to fulfil-offensive or defensive.Troops already detailed for the offensive, which was to anticipate the Japanesein Singora, were standing to ready to move at short notice.It was understood that no move across the frontier was to take place unlessordered by Malaya Command, who in their turn had to await instructions from london.The final orders, cancelling the advance on Singora and directing that theJitra position be occupied, were received at 11 Division H.Q. on the afternoon of 8th December.Obviously a surprise move of this description, allowing for only a narrowmargin of error in time, should not have been subject to the risk of delay betweenSingapore and London.Although the preparations had been made with all possible secrecy, the troops had more than an inkling of what was intended.To this sudden abandonment of the offensive must be attributed in part, atany rate, the drop in morale in the 6th and 15th Brigades during the daysimmediately following.In place of the larger operation, permission was given for the despatch of.two small columns, one to the North and the other through Kroh, to the North-West to enter Thailand, and carry out demolitions.One of these columns was ambushed and the total delaying effect of bothwas negligible.Judged in the light of what we now know of Japanese preparation, oftheir exact information of our strength and movements and of the true attitudeof the Thais, chances of success against Singora would seem to have been highlyproblematical. Without delaying the enemy in any appreciable degree, therewas every probability of losing an entire brigade.The Jitra position was admittedly not a good one, the most that could besaid for it being that it was better than any other in that area. One of the main reasons for choosing to stand *so far north was to protect Kedah State, thegranary of Malaya.Owing to the Japanese anticipating by three months the earliest accepteddate for landings on the East Coast, work on the position was far from com-plete, though this in point of fact did not have a decisive bearing on the issue, asthe Japanese took advantage of an irremediable natural weakness a thickjungle on the right flank of the position.In finding their way through an area considered to be passable only by cutting a passage, the enemy not only effected a surprise but exploded the first of a number of erroneous ideas concerning the countryside in Malaya.
Contact between the forces was first made on the 9th December, and on the night the 11th/12th the Division, already shaken, withdrew to Gurun, some25 miles to the South.In this action the Japanese employed tactics which proved highly successfulthroughout the campaign. The method is dealt with in detail later. Briefly, itconsisted in locating the areas held and the flanks by drawing fire, working roundor through in small parties, threatening the road the vital feature and causingconfusion by shooting from unexpected directions. At Jitra this was accom-panied by comparatively heavy frontal attack pressed with great determination.Even before it had been decided to withdraw from Jitra the ground staff ofthe Alor Star aerodrome, 16 miles south, had set fire to petrol and some buildings and were preparing to leave. The aerodrome had been bombed before news ofthe landing was received and the staff, hearing the planes, presumed they werefriendly. H.Q. 11th Division had received no warning of intended evacuationprior to the firing of stores.The landing at Kota Bahru on night the 6th/7th December, under theconditions prevailing at the time, indicated a thorough mastery of this type of operation. It is doubtful whether any staff but the Japanese would have con-sidered feasible an attempt at this season of the year and in the face of highlyorganized beach defences. Their losses were very roughly estimated at 1,500killed.No Japanese planes appeared until the forenoon of the 8th December, while our Hudsons and Buffaloes attacked and burnt out two transports and destroyedmany landing craft. Once ashore in strength, it was only a matter of hoursbefore they succeeded in worming their way to the rear of the beach defences.The coastal area is intersected with creeks and streams and there are extensiveswamps and stretches of jungle.The Japanese intelligence organization was controlled by ex-settlers whohad spent years in the district and who in turn controlled their own guides,spies and messengers among the local Malays. With the help of these they were able to move more rapidly and make better dispositions than our own troopsbrought up as reserves from only a few miles to the South.By night 7th/8th December the situation generally, and in particular the aerodrome, had so far deteriorated that it was decided to withdraw to a linebehind the beaches. There was great confusion and scattering of units movingover this difficult ground in heavy rain and darkness.By the 11th December the 8th Brigade was at Chong Dong, 25 miles southof Kota Bahru and was withdrawing to the road and rail junction of&quot;Kuala Krai.In less than ten days the Japanese had obtained five first-class aerodromes Kota Bahru, Lachang and Gong Kedah on the east coast; Alor Star and SungeiPatani on the west they were thus able to make full use of their superiority in numbers, and largely in the quality, of their aircraft.For the remainder of the campaign operations on the east coast were of minor importance, with the exception of the landing at Kuantan, which gave the enemyhis first aerodrome within fighter range of Singapore and resulted immediately in sustained daylight raids on the naval base and town. Meanwhile, on the westcoast tired troops continued their withdrawal under constant pressure.The unexpectedly rapid evacuation of Jitra and inability to stand at Gurunendangered Penang before the civil and military authorities had time to considerthe problem of evacuation. Deliberate terroristic bombing from a low levelcompleted the panic and confusion.  Civilian morale received a very severe blow.12th Brigade, in Command Reserve, was sent up from Singapore to theGrik area to attempt to hold up the Japanese, who, by making use of the salientin the Thai frontier between Kroh and Grik and striking south-west, werethreatening the communication of all our forces in Kedah. This tlueatdetermined the speed of the withdrawal of 11th Division, which had reachedthe Perak River by the 20th December.While there is an apparently monotonous regularity about the numerous rear-guard actions in this 400-mile withdrawal, a closer study of detailed accountswill probably show numerous minor differences and changes in British and japanese methods as the area of operations was shifted southwards.. The Kampar position, 90 miles north of Kuala Lumpur, occupied at the endof December, was the first position since Jitra was evacuated which offered anopportunity of holding the enemy for a reasonable period.  With a good field of
fire, strong flanks, and good observation, offsetting to some extent the enemy&apos;sadvantage in the air, the Japanese were unable to use their usual technique andwere several times beaten back with heavy loss. They eventuallv turned us outof the position by a landing n$ar Telok Anson, some 20 miles from the sea onthe Perak River. Troops were transported in country boats or in special bargeswhich had been brought over land; these craft were towed by tugs or launchesfound undamaged in Penang Harbour after the panic evacuation. From TelokAnson a very real threat was developing against main road and rail communica-tion to the south.   Kampar had to be evacuated.From now until the extreme south of the peninsula was reached, landings onthe west cpast became a ruling factor in the operations and accounted, togetherwith pressure from the north, for our continued rapid withdrawal.At Slim River, the next important position after Kampar, Japanese tanks were used in strength for the first time. As early&apos; as Jitra tanks had been inaction, but only in very small numbers; at the Slim River they were estimated atthirty. They broke through a reasonably good position during darkness andcompletely scattered a brigade, inflicting heavy loss.In Johore a further landing at Muar resulted in the almost total destructionof another brigade; at Batu Pahat, 30 miles to the south, the manoeuvre was repeated with heavy loss to 53rd Infantry Brigade.The A.I.F. were in action for the first time in the Gemas area, and thereafterthroughout the fighting in Johore. They were better acquainted with the groundthey were fighting over than troops who had withdrawn from the north. Theywere able to profit by the experience of others and laid a number of effectiveambushes. An attempt to hold the enemy on the Ayer Hitam-Batu Pahat linefailed; landings on the east coast compelled withdrawal from Mensing. Thewhole force crossed on to Singapore Island. The Johore Causeway was breachedon the morning of the 31st January.Owing to road blocks, hasty retirements at night, or the difficulty of findingthem in thick country, many wounded were left in enemy hands on the mainland.Still larger numbers of unwounded men, British, Indian and Australians,separated from their units during battle and unable to find their way back to singapore, must have either fallen into the hands of the enemy or remained inhiding. Very large quantities of stores, ammunition and equipment of everydescription and a large number of vehicles were destroyed, but a great deal musthave been left undamaged.The speed of withdrawal made this inevitable; in addition, as each largecentre was evacuated, all that could be lifted was back-loaded to the next pointin rear, and in this manner the dumps grew to an extent which rendered their removal impossible.In almost exactly seven weeks from the opening of hostilities a force of twoIndian divisions with formations from the 18th British Division, and theAustralian Division, had%been forced off the mainland.The 11th Indian Division had covered over 400 miles. The scale of thisdisaster, apart from its sequel the fall of the fortress would tempt one to search for some hidden, startling explanation, and yet, even with the facts now available, the causes are in the main clear enough. They are many and, though in no way mysterious, the inter-relation between them is complex and the contribu-tion of each to the final result difficult to compute. They are dealt with belowas general and military considerations affecting the campaign.3. General Considerations Affecting the Campaign.(a) Assessment vf the Enemy.Equally disastrous in its consequences and incredible in its inaccuracy was our estimate of the Japanese Army and Air Force.Presumably observers based their opinions on inferior units seen during theearly fighting in China or, through a misunderstanding of the real nature of thewar&quot; in Chiria, concluded that failure to subdue the Chinese was due to a lowstandard of training and efficiency.Whatever the cause, it is difficult to believe that our military policy in malaya and even our high policy could have been accepted as it stood, had ourestimate been even partly in keeping with the facts. This applies particularly to the Japanese Air Force.
Even admitting that a Power may construct secretly new types of aircraft,there is little justification for a policy of disparagement of both the quality of machines and efficiency of personnel. This attitude was adopted by at least oneinfluential newspaper in Malaya, thereby encouraging popular complacency andresulting in an equally dangerous drop in morale when the true facts became known.From the outset it was obvious that Brewster Buffalo in Malaya was no matchfor the best Japanese fighter and that their best bombers were good. Equallytheir pilots were enterprising and skilful and their high-level bombing accurate.That they would be completely outclassed by our best machines is equally true,but our Hurricanes arrived too late, when command of the air had passed to theenemy, and in insufficient numbers to right the balance.The sinking of Repulse and Prince of Wales proved a thorough mastery ofthe handling of torpedo bombers. As regards their other arms, while due weightmust be given to the overwhelming natural advantages they enjoyed owing to thecircumstances under which the campaign was fought, it must be admitted that allround the standard was far higher than had. been expected and that in some respects (e.g., landing operations, choice of equipment and military engineering),their work was of a very high order.  Tactical methods are dealt with elsewhere.(b) Lack of Air Support.This was one of the major causes of failure and has been classed as the chiefcause for the alarming lack of will to resist noticeable during the final phase.The effect of finding ourselves not only very heavily outnumbered and generally outclassed in the air was all the greater because of the prevalentconviction that in this sphere the Japanese would be speedily dominated. Thenumber of aerodromes recently constructed was alone an indication of the partour air force was intended to play, and yet almost immediately our air force inthe North was either overwhelmed or forced to withdraw. Our fighters wereoutclassed and. both bombers and fighters were destroyed in large numbers on or over their own aerodromes. In this the Japanese Fifth Column took a prominentpart. Times of departure of our bombers from their aerodromes was communicated to the enemy and, by calculation on fuel capacity or by means offurther signals, the enemy contrived with uncanny accuracy to reach the aerodrome when our machines were on the ground or about to land, for refuelling.Alor Star, most northerly aerodrome in Kedah, was actually bombed beforethe personnel were aware that Japan had declared war. The wires to KotaBahru had been cut to prevent news of the landing getting through. As aresult, within 48 hours of the outbreak of hostilities petrol was being fired,buildings destroyed and the runway mined prior to evacuation. Simultaneouslyat sea, inability to provide fighter protection led to the loss of our capital ships.As the five northern aerodromes fell into his hands so the enemy&apos;s domination of the battlefields increased. His attacks on ground targets were not heavy, butthe nuisance value was great and moral effect on young troops still greater. the cumulative result on tired men was to be seen later in the south and onSingapore Island where dive and low-level bombing and machine gunningbecame more and more persistent.Inability to protect Penang from the air had far-reaching results.Deliberately ruthless bombing and. machine-gunning, particularly of the Chinesequarter, inflicting thousands of casualties, causing panic which affected the whole country. sWhether our loss of air superiority was due to a calamitous underestimateof Japanese air efficiency, to the absence of expected reinforcements owing to enemy advancing date of attack by 3 months, or to a combination of these, results were equally disastrous.(c) Propaganda.Conditions in Malaya political, military and racial were peculiarlysuitable for the development of effective propaganda. The Japanese took full advantage of the situation. Enjoying unbroken success they were in a positionto add threats to persuasion, threats which the population realised might shortly be implemented. This would induce a more cautious attitude among the Chinese,who were impervious to any form of blandishment.   Chinese waverers might even
go over wholeheartedly to the Japanese Camp. To the Malays, the Japaneserepresented themselves as liberators from the British, who had no right in thecountry anyway and under whose protection the Chinese were stealing the wealthof the land.One of their leaflets read : Malays, we are your friends, and intend to drive out the Europeans,who have enslaved you, also kill off the Chinese who have taken the wealth ofyour country. So that we can identify you at all times, wear your hats.&quot;Asia for the Asiatics!The ground had been well prepared. Japanese employers of labour, planters,mine owners, managers of trading concerns, had been just and very liberal to their people and had promised that those who assisted them would be suitably rewardedwhen the country was conquered.In some States particularly those formally belonging to Siam an anti-British bias already existed and it needed little effort to convert this into adefinite pro-Japanese attitude.To the Tamil coolies they promised a continuance of employment with fairwages and. rewards for help, while harping on the theme that Asia was for theAsiatics. In the case of the Australian they worked on a known or suspectedlack of cordiality between themselves and the British, whose officers, ran the wording of a leaflet, &quot;regarded the Australian as an uncouth sheep farmer.&quot;&quot; Go home,&quot; it concluded, &quot; or be killed mercilessly by us.&quot;The line taken in the case of Indian troops was that the Japanese quarrelwas with the British only and that if they (Indians) would come over they wouldnot be harmed, but given the choice of helping to drive out the British or laying down their arms and going free.Two Gurkha officers, captured at Jitra, were actually released afterinterrogation and allowed to return to their unit to spread this message amongtheir men.Backed by unvarying success in the field, these obvious lines of propaganda,in spite of some very crude and badly-prepared examples, were certain to be effective.Our task was more complex and the machinery should, have beencorrespondingly more suited to the task. Unfortunately the organisation lacking centralised control over all forms of propaganda was quite unable tomake an effective reply.(d) Utilisation of Man Power.One of the most far-reaching results of complacency of a conviction that war could not come to Malaya was the failure to organise man-power in time.30,000 coolies could have been given military work on Singapore Island aloneduring the campaign. This number was never available and during the criticaldays of the seige only 1,000 were working, and only in broken periods, owing to air raids.The need for the organisation of Chinese labour was recognised by MalayaCommand as early as 1938 and the civil authorities were approached then and again the following year, but they refused to consider the scheme. Had therebeen available at the outbreak of hostilities even 5,000 labourers, organised undervernacular speaking British officers, much of the chaos of December and Januarymight have been avoided. Aerodromes could have been repaired rapidly, shipsunloaded and ammunition sent up-country in time; lastly, and most important,some defences, at least, could have been completed on the unprotected, north and north-west coasts of the Island. Under modern conditions, where all are in thefront line, only comparatively highly organised labour will suffice and workersmust be induced to undertake dangerous jobs, such as repair of aerodromes, by making provision for their families in the event of death or injury.Some observers have attributed the lack of such labour in Singapore as amain cause of disaster. The Chinese community, even before the outbreak ofhostilities, had asked to be allowed to form fighting units, but the administrationrefused to consider the project.No doubt the whole question of the status of the so-called &quot; Straits &quot; andother Chinese, and our relations with the Government of Chungking, in respectof their subjects required careful handling.  However, when the situation became
critical sanction was given for the formation of a Chinese guerrilla force under british officers. Chinese Communists, particularly when the ban was removed,took a prominent part. Quite untrained and armed with an assortment of.sporting weapons, this Chinese Corps acted as scouts and watchers on dangerousstretches of the Island shore, where some were involved in the fighting and suffered heavy casualties. They were steadfast, intensely anti-Japanese and, ifproperly trained, would have been of great value on the mainland as well as onthe Island.   The project was undertaken too late.Another source of man-power not utilised to the best advantage wereEnglishmen, such as planters, mine managers or prospectors, Forest Officers and engineers, who had lived for years in the country. A large proportion of thesemen belonged to various volunteer corps and as such were embodied on theoutbreak of war with Japan and employed chiefly on routine duties. Meanwhiletroops in the field, ignorant of language, customs or topography, were at a gravedisadvantage. They could not utilise the jungle paths, wasted valuable timebringing in harmless inhabitants for interrogation, were unable to make the simplest inquiries.While it would have been impracticable to have taken planters and otherswith local knowledge from their employment long before the outbreak of war.such individuals could have been registered in advance for the duties they wouldbe called upon to perform in the areas with which they were acquainted. such men were used on the Thai border, but not extensively. As a critical stage inthe campaign was reached, volunteers were commissioned and attached to units for liaison work and as interpreters and, in general justified their appointment.The experiment was made too late.(e) Civil Morale.Considering that the enemy was in a position to bomb centres of populationwhen and where he wished, the morale of civilians was better than might havebeen expected.The unexpectedness and severity of the Penang raid certainly caused a panic,which was not surprising, seeing that thousands of dead were lying about the streets unburied for days. Under this ordeal all the municipal services came toa standstill, except in so far as some Europeans managed to keep hospitals open,electrical plants working, and so on. The Police and A.R.P. workers provedquite unreliable; widespread looting took place after the bombing. The evacua-tion of Europeans alone it was, of course, impossible to move the entire Chinese and Indian communities was the subject of severe criticism and a deputationwaited on the Governor with a protest. Both in Penang and in the country asa whole members of the civil service seldom remained to the last.As far as Penang is concerned, it is difficult to see how a debacle could havebeen averted under the circumstances. The Governor himself had believed thatour air strength was sufficient to protect the town and neither Malaya Commandnor any other authority believed that the Jitra position would be forced andPenang uncovered in a matter of days.A further complication in Malayan towns was the preponderance of&quot; foreigners &quot; i.e., British, Chinese, Indians who looked on the Governmentto arrange for their removal in the event of bombing or invasion.A vast organization, prepared, well in advance, would have been required todeal with evacuation on such a scale and, as war itself, much less a rapid over-running of the country, was regarded only as a remote possibility, no such schemewas in existence.The lessons of Penang were given effect to immediately in Singapore; A.R.P.organization overhauled and a senior military officer appointed as Director-General. He was assisted by a prominent civilian who had himself experiencedthe raid in Penang. The result was that Singapore was well prepared, exceptin the matter of shelters in the crowded Chinese quarter, and the population asa whole stood up well to the moderate bombing of the first weeks. As a sequelto the killing and wounding of 500 or 600 in one raid, small restaurants andcafes, on which the Chinese largely depend for meals in addition to small stores,were closed, but speedily reopened under threat of confiscation. Thousands of town dwellers Chinese, Malay and Indian made a practice of leaving the townevery evening to sleep in the outlying villages.
To the end the European population remained calm. Of the Asiatics, theChinese showed least inclination to panic. During the last phase, from the10th to the loth February, when the town, in addition to heavy bombing, wassubjected to shelling, morale gave way entirely, wounded were too numerous toreceive attention; the town was largely on fire.   The breakdown was complete.(f) Fifth Column Activities.&apos;The opinion was widely held among the troops that every Malay was an active or a potential fifth columnist, while some, with previous experience of thecountry, have occasionally taken the exactly contrary view, maintaining thatthe Malays as a whole were loyal.It is naturally difficult to find where the truth lies between these two extremes,particularly owing to the Japanese habit of clothing a large proportion of their&quot; stalker scouts &quot; in Malay dress.        - -Another difficulty, arose owing to the impossibility of clearing local inhabitants from areas in which operations were taking place. At Gurun, inKedah, for example, a large number of Malays and others had been rounded up,but it was found impossible to evacuate them, with the result that when theJapanese launched an attack these inhabitants commenced running through partof the area occupied by the 11th Division. Large numbers of Japanese indisguise would have no difficulty in passing into our lines under these circum-stances. Similarly, between the 11th and the 15th February on Singapore Island,during the operations of the 18th Division round Bukit Timah village and the race Course, local inhabitants, apparently frightened from their homes, were constantly wandering through the lines, often at dusk, and it would be quite impossible for newly arrived British troops to distinguish bona fide villagersfrom Japanese scouts.That there was latterly a great deal of fifth column activity on the islandis proved by the detection and execution of nine Malays between the 9th and the14th February, by one Field Security Officer. One of the men shot was caughtplacing twigs bearing red and white strips on the positions of a unit of the18th Division.   He carried a supply of identical strips inside his pagri.Unquestionably the number of Malays working, for the enemy variedaccording to districts. As explained under &quot; Propaganda,&quot; the Malays of theex-Siamese States, particularly Kedah and Kelantan, were easily persuaded toassist the Japanese, and there were innumerable instances of Headquarters,defended localities and so on being marked in various ingenious ways so as tobe visible from the air. In addition, enemy parties were guided through thethickest jungle and across swamps by paths known only to local inhabitants.These activities, though frequently noted, were not so common in the South. the landing craft at Kota Bahru were enabled to hit off the beaches exactly by lightsarranged among the trees. Perhaps the most serious form of activity was thatdirected against our aircraft, and the heavy losses sustained at the very outset canbe attributed to information sent from the vicinity of the Northern aerodromes.By this means many machines were destroyed either on the ground when refuel -ling or when about to land. At least one European was detected using a secrettransmitter for this purpose. On Singapore Island a very efficient organizationenabled the Japanese to bomb aircraft dispersal areas, no matter how wellconcealed or how often changed. Lights, concealed in hollow tree stumps, were used to guide enemy aircraft. Of several transmitters known to be working onthe Island or neighbourhood, a few were never located owing to absence of adetector.Considering the exact knowledge of the country and people acquired by theJapanese over a period of years, their known organizing ability and their declared intentions, it would have been surprising had their fifth column been less numerous and efficient than was, in fact, the case.The only counter an impracticable one under peace conditions wouldhave been to forbid or limit strictly their entry into Malaya.(g) Civil and Military Co-operation and Co-ordination.Given the general belief that war in Malaya was unlikely, it was hardly tobe expected that the military authorities would press, or the civil authoritiesaccept, without protest, the drastic changes entailed in establishing unified
military control. In practice, unified control was never fully established; tothe very end the Governor enjoyed a large measure of authority.We now know that the only satisfactory solution would have been theappointment of a supreme authority (a Military Governor) over all the servicesand the Civil Administration. The appointment should have been made in good time and Martial Law should have been introduced earlier than was the case.Without these measures, and notwithstanding goodwill on both sides, smoothworking was an impossibility. Under the circumstances the problems were toointricate and too urgent to be solved by conference. Machinery should have beenin existence long before the emergency arose.Many instances could be cited of the harmful effects of divided control, as for instance, the turning down by the Civil Administration of the military pro-posal to enrol Chinese for military works and, later, as fighting men. The first,certainly, put in hand in good time, might have had a profound effect on thecourse of the operations.The evacuation of Penang was the occasion for acute disagreement, con-fusion and recrimination, owing to the issue of orders on which the civil authorities considered they should have been consulted. The Penang catastrophedid, however, have one good result, namely, the appointment of a senior officeras Director-General of the Civil Defence Services in Singapore, leading to animmediate improvement of defence measures.As to the attitude of the civil authorities up country, military officers&apos;reports varied between gratitude for whole-hearted co-operation and condemn a-tion of deliberate obstruction. In Singapore there was the case where a specialcourt set up under the War Ordinance to try civilians was declared illegal by theChief Justice under a statute of James II.In regard to rationing of food, petrol, street lighting restrictions and theevacuation of civilians, civil officers on one side, and military on the other, were responsible to different chiefs.4. Military Considerations.(a) Physical Conditions.Comparisons were frequently made in Malaya between Japanese toughnessand frugality and the apparent softness of British and Indian troops.It is true that, even under very trying climatic conditions, they displayed ahigher standard of endurance than our men, but it is equally true that thissuperiority derives from the nature of Japanese life itself, from the social and,in particular, the economic structure of the country. The Japanese is frugalbecause his country, per head of population, is poor. He eats rice, one of the cheapest of foods, and fish. In comparison, the fighting classes of India, in theirown homes, live in luxury. The Indian, and these are numbered in millions,who lives on a level approximately to that of the Japanese peasant, lacks thestamina and fighting qualities of the latter. This is a difference, militarily avery significant one, between the two races which we have to accept.The British soldier, as far as standard of living is concerned, belongs to acategory too far removed for comparison.The question is whether any measures we could have taken in Malaya, or which we may take in future, can bring us appreciably nearer to the Japanese intoughness and frugality.It is true that, in conformity with changing standards among the people both at home and in India, the army ration has tended to improve steadily in quality and in variety, if not in quantity. Those with pre-1914 experience of rationingin the Indian Army will be inclined to criticise this tendency; in the case ofBritish troops the scale is now a luxury one, but a policy of this nature cannotbe suddenly and radically altered, with the result that in Malaya between80 and 90 different ration commodities were being issued. While an all-round .lowering of scale is essential, even the most drastic curtailment could not, andwill not, enable the Indian soldier, let alone the British, to approximate to theJapanese standard under the conditions obtaining in Malaya.In the matter of endurance, two vital considerations are apt to be over-looked : firstly, that the Japanese had found it possible to train their troops forthis particular campaign under conditions of climate and terrain approximating[24104] c 2
to those of Malaya; secondly, that among the Indian troops was a large proportion-of very young soldiers, and the young Indian commonly outgrows his strength.A fairer comparison could be made between any seasoned battalion in. say,Waziristan, and a good Japanese unit from Malaya.But even when all the factors peculiar to this campaign are given their truevalue, it is clear that in the matter of frugality our troops must compare unfavourably with the Japanese, while in endurance admitting that he sets avery high standard much will depend on circumstances (for instance, under conditions prevailing in Burma the disparity was less marked than in Malaya.Inequality is to be offset, not in attempting to outdo the Japanese in the sphere where he enjoys peculiar advantages, but where we hold, or ought to hold,the lead, e.g., in better aircraft, more of them, and better pilots.(b) Morale.Observers have been puzzled at the admittedly low level of morale during the campaign on the mainland and astounded at the collapse on the Island betweenthe 12th and loth February. They speak and write of the caving in of 80.000men as something sinister and mysterious.Now, from a little distance, the explanation is clear.Most of these men were desperately tired, and they knew that for the timebeing no ship could come in. They had been looking to Singapore as a haven,but instead of a rest the most tired of them, the 11th Indian Division, had to digand wire. The Australians had to dig; too, but they had not fought for long norcome so far.Few of these troops could boast of a success; all had been out-numbered,out-manoeuvred, and never a friendly plane in the sky. They had seen wholebrigades melt away in a few hours in the Jungle, so thoroughly destroyed as a fighting body that a few hundreds of foot-sore men are all that would reachSingapore by jungle path or country boat.The enemy, as&apos; well aware as ourselves of the condition of men, calculated that shelling, increased bombing and a steady advance would crack them.(c) Japanese Tactics.The keynote of Japanese tactics was simplicity. They discovered the location of flanks and defended localities and proceeded to carry out wide turningmovements while infiltrating into the position. They realised that the road wasthe vital tactical feature and the flanking movement might come in as much asfive miles behind our forward troops. As an alternative they would sometimesattack frontally down the road on a narrow front, the leading troops beingcyclists.They appreciated correctly the superiority of mortars over artillery in theMalaya country, and attained a high degree of accuracy combined with speed in getting on to the target. The moral effect of this fire was even greater thanthe casualties inflicted.Enjoying complete air superiority, they frequently bombed from a height of only 1,000 feet, with marked effect on inexperienced troops. Their tanks,light and medium, on the only occasion they were used in strength on the mainland(Battle of Slim River), broke into the position to a depth of five miles, completelydisrupted a Brigade and inflicted severe casualties. They exploited the effects of noise on inexperienced or shaken troops in the jungle by letting off crackers,opening bursts of heavy and probably unaimed fire from unexpected directionsand even shouting and howling.Their methods showed a correct appreciation of the factors peculiar to junglewarfare and attention to detail. They were eminently successful, but, asremarked elsewhere, in considering the success of their tactics full weight shouldbe given to the overwhelming advantage they enjoyed in numbers and air superiority, ability to live off the country, mix undetected with the inhabitants,and so on. Their men were seasoned and they were in a position to train speciallyfor this campaign; in fact, the whole tactical edifice rested on the skill of theirspecially picked and trained light troops. These were the men, lightly clad, oftenin Malay dress, who drew fire from our forward troops, even if it entailed ridingbicycles into an ambush, and who then led the main body in the encirclingmovement through the jungle&apos;.   They were bold, fearless, fanatical and highly
skilled in jungle craft, made use of the tree-tops for observation and field of fire and had even perfected a system for climbing. They could maintain direction and always know where they were.The current exaggerated estimate of Japanese efficiency is very largely basedon the skill of these picked men. The bulk of their troops, while undoubtedlyspecially trained for the campaign, were not in the same class as these &quot; stalker-scouts &quot; as they have been called.In two other respects the Japanese have attained a very high standard&apos; engineer repair work and landing operations. As regards the former, it hasbeen stated that our demolitions delayed them on the average just one-third ofthe time anticipated. This is partly explained by the use of repair materialcollected by us near bridges for use in case of damage from bombing during ourintended advance northwards. The enemy&apos;s crackers and fire from flanks andrear would fail to draw a reply from steady troops, but in circumstances firediscipline was non-existent and positions were given away with extraordinaryregularity. In depth on the road was the answer to the enemy&apos;s methods and yet we adopted a stereotyped layout suitable to normal conditions.(d) Training.From the very opening of hostilities it was obvious that there was somethingseriously wrong with our training, for not only was the method unsuited for meeting Japanese tactics, but individually our men were inferior as junglefighters. In conjunction with other serious disadvantages, including inferiorityin numbers, and lack of air support, weakness in training was little short ofdisastrous.The reasons for this state of affairs may be classed as either basic, that is,allied to our state of unpreparedness in every field, civil as well as military, forwar in Malaya, or as immediate reasons arising from mistakes or omissions ofthose on the spot. While the first group cannot, because of their bearing on theimmediate causes, be ignored, they will be treated as briefly as possible.The first of the basic causes for our weakness in training was the failure torealise in time that, to fight successfully in Malaya, troops must undergo a highly specialised form of training. The minimum period suggested.by one authorityfor this training was 6 months, the concurrent acclimatization of the man being of course, almost as important as the lessons themselves. Even allowing thatexigencies of the war as a whole would permit of only half this period beingmade available, could we have met the situation ? The ideal would have been to maintain in Malaya, say, four or five infantry divisions for a period long enough to allow of maximum efficiency being reached and short enough to avoidstaleness. Alternatively, a smaller force could have been maintained in thecountry, while intended reinforcements were being trained for jungle warfareon the most suitable terrain available in India. It is unnecessary to labour thepoint that war with Japan was not expected in 1941 and that, even if it hadbeen, there was little we could do about it.Troops of the Empire may be called on to fight in the Arctic, or on theEquator, on snowfields, in jungles or in deserts, and we cannot allow ourselvesthe luxury of narrow specialization in the case of large bodies of men. Warfarein Malaya unfortunately calls for a high degree of specialization.Libya, Iraq, Persia, were the theatres in which British and Indian troops under training in 1940 would most likely be called to fight, and in all thesetheatres mechanization was the key to success and, accordingly, the Indian Army,if it can be said to. have specialized at all, concentrated on motors; in Malayaover-reliance on motors meant defeat. It is not difficult to picture the case ofthe Indian soldier, who, eyes on Libya or Persia, had been rushed through an intensive course of motorization. The vehicle saved time and toil, it won battles;it must be used on all occasions, everywhere. In Malaya the climate discouragesthe manhandling of loads, even over the shortest distances; men who were soft,unless Continually checked, would tend to keep the transport too far up and theywould also shirk the erection of tank obstacles likely to keep their own vehiclesat a distance. The Japanese, quick to note this, put road blocks at a comparatively short distance behind the troops, with the result that a stiff action had to befought over the block. If this failed, vehicles, wounded and much valuableequipment had to be abandoned.   The classic instance is the action of Parit
Sulong, between Muar and Batu Pahat, where a force was practically wiped out and whole lorry loads of wounded abandoned. This worship of the lorry wasvicious; it stultified our efforts to cope with an enemy who was exceedinglymobile on foot. It became the master, instead of being the servant, of tacticalmethod. Transport should have been parked miles in rear (Japanese flankingmovements would hit the road 4 or 5 miles behind the forward troops), then ourmen would have had to march more often and would have been tougher.Outstanding among the immediate (remediable) causes of our faulty trainingwas a lack of guidance from Malaya Command. This in turn was due to anunimaginative approach to the whole problem of jungle warfare, lack of detailed study necessary for the formation of a definite policy, with the result that theconspicuous successes scored by certain units and formations were the results oftheir own theories, experiments and practice. In this connection it is remarkablethat the only formation which consistently faced the Japanese with confidence,either in attack or defence, delayed them and inflicted severe loss, was a brigadewhich had been in Malaya since 1939. It suggests that experience counts more in this type of fighting than in any other. It was one of the tragedies that thevery efficiency of this brigade necessitated their being employed until they ceased to exist.An officer with long experience of Indian frontier militia corps once said&quot;Put boots on an.Indian sepoy and he ceases to think.&quot; He was, of course,making a comparison between the regular Indian infantryman and his ownPathan scouts, who wear sandals, semi-native dress and carry 50 rounds in aleather bandolier. In Malaya, we not only kept the sepoy&apos;s boots on, butencouraged him to sit in a lorry, when he is by nature an irregular the Pathanbeing supreme a good marcher and frugal. We left him with the impedimentafor a winter campaign in North Africa and expected him to compete with anenemy who had discarded everything except vest, cotton trousers, gym shoes and small-bore rifle.Iii considering our failure to evolve satisfactory tactical methods, allowance had to be made for the great disadvantages under which we fought disadvantagesunconnected with faulty training or unsuitable equipment. Chief among these was our numerical weakness and lack of air support which compelled ourcommanders not only to fight always on the defensive, but reduced their mento a physical and moral condition not far removed from complete breakdown.The experience in Malaya of troops being unable to get the measure of anew enemy and strange conditions is not unique. Waziristan in 1919-20 is aparallel case. The troops employed were, in the main, those who had fought,and fought well, in the closing stages of the Palestine Campaign; they could digtrenches, use hand grenades and Stokes mortars and were efficient with thebayonet. They were steady under shell fire and yet one unit after another wascut up during the advance up the Takki Zam against an enemy who had noartillery, no aircraft and no machine guns. He merely knew the secret of theuse of ground and was an excellent rifle shot. These regiments of 1919 learnttheir lesson in a month or two and advanced into the heart of the country. in malaya there was no time or opportunity to put into practice what we had learnt.(e) Information.The paucity of useful,, up-to-date information from the firing-line was oneof the marked features of this campaign. The &quot;main reason was certainly theconditions under which we were fighting, that is to say. continually being pushedback with dangerous situations following one another at such short intervals sothat all attention was devoted to avoiding being cut off. Secondly, neither officersnor men realised the importance of gleaning every possible item of information- even the way their shoes were fastened about the enemy. Even allowing forthe difficulties in making captures when on the defensive and mostly retiring fast,enemy weapons and equipment must have fallen into our hands and very little ofthis was ever sent back for examination.With regard to prisoners, the position was still worse and the conduct of theforce in this respect is still somewhat of a mystery. No more than 12 prisoners were sent back to the base, and these included pilots who had baled cut. Moremust have been captured. It is a matter of training, till every officer and man.down to the youngest, realizes that all information-however trivial isimportant.
5. Defences of Singapore Island.While a.review of all the circumstances attending the selection and protec-tion of the Seletar Naval Base would be out of place here, the main facts must betouched on for an understanding of the position when Singapore fell.At the time it was chosen the Seletar site possessed almost every possibleadvantage. The only sea approach was up the narrow, but deep, Johpre Strait,and effective bombardment try a hostile fleet would be impossible in the face of heavy coast batteries. Equally, landing from seawards would be extremelyhazardous, if not impossible, under fire of coast guns and on defended beaches.The influence of developments in the air could at that time be seen only in ageneral way, but there was certainly no reason to expect our inferiority in the air to an enemy in Malaya. An attack from the north might be made by an enemyenjoying command of the sea by landing, say, at Mersing, on the East Coast,though operations of this type were becoming more and more risky unless thearmy attempting them had also complete air superiority. There remained thepossibility of an advance down the length of the peninsula, by an army based onIndo-China or Thailand or from landing in the North-East.In this connection the collapse of Trance and all it has since entailed in everytheatre of war would scarcely be treated as a likely factor in appreciations often years ago.   Such was the background.On the outbreak of war in 1939 many aerodromes had been planned or werebeing built on the peninsula. Air was to play the main part in defence. Possiblelanding beaches were being&quot; wired and pill-boxes erected. France had not been attacked.Engineers were still putting the final touches to the Naval Base in Singiaporeand this work was actually continued until the evacuation.In this event the army and air force in Malaya would have failed in their main role.The primary role of the army and air force in Malaya was to ensure theuninterrupted functioning of the naval base. The quickest and cheapest way for anenemy to put the base out of action if only temporarily would be by heavy andfrequent raids by fighter-escorted bombers. Seizure of aerodromes south ofKuantan/Kuala Lumpur would bring an enemy air force within fighter range ofthe Naval Base.Looked at in this way the provision of elaborate defences all round SingaporeIsland could only be regarded as insurance against an unlikely and hazardousenterprise. The insurance might certainly have been taken out after Japan&apos;sassumption of virtual control of Indo-China and Thailand, but for two difficulties,and one false assumption : The first difficulty lay in the nature of the ground on the West and North-West shores, where there are creeks with mud banks, and a heavy growth ofmangrove. Booms would have been required at the mouths of the creeks; strong points organised on craft either anchored or sunk or, alternatively, in pill boxesbuilt among the mud banks and swamps. It could have been done if commenced in time.The second, difficulty was over labour. For .the amount of work to be done,in keeping pace with the situation and a growing garrison there was insufficientlabour for military purposes on Singapore Island. After the middle of 1940there was certainly insufficient labour available to Malaya Command for theconstruction of a thorough system of defences round the whole Island perimeter.There was, in fact, a grave shortage for meeting urgent day-to-day requirements.The false assumption made refers to the effectiveness of the mangroveswamps themselves as obstacles. Though not easily penetrated, they could notbe treated, as impassable to an enterprising enemy who had studied the problem and had proved his skill in landing operations. There were, of course, otherstretches of shore where little had been done in the way of defence, for instance,eastwards between  the Naval Base and Sungei Seletar and thence towardsChangi, but the ground was easi.er in these areas and even in the short periodavailable after withdrawal to the Island it was found possible to accomplish morethan on the West and North-West.The question of the mangrove-covered shore between the Sungei Jurong andKranji, has been dealt with more fully because of its influence on the course ofevents.
To sum up. in the earlier period of the development of the Naval Base,complete perimeter defence of the Island was not regarded as urgent or at anyrate sufficiently important to hinder completion of the mam works. When warin the west commenced all available labour was required for speeding up half-finished projects and meeting new developments; on the outbreak of war with japan there was neither time nor labour. In the last phase, with all troopswithdrawn to the Island, there was no time.6. Events on Singapore Islano, 31st January-15th February, 1942.In the light of information now available it would, appear that hopes of holding Singapore after withdrawal across the Causeway were based on too optimistic an appreciation.The numbers available- until these were scrutinised and scaled down totheir true value-were certainly impressive. They have been put at between70,000 and 80,000, but they included some thousands it is impossible to calculatethe number even approximately belonging to the ancillary services. There were many non-combatants.In addition to A.A. and. the very powerful coast batteries there were sixField Regiments R.A. and two anti-Tank Regiments. There was a very completesystem of defences designed to prevent landings on the North-East. South-East,and South-Westerly beaches.As against these could be counted a formidable array of factors, of whichthe significance is only now apparent. Firstly, there was the question of time time to reorganise the defence so as to be able to throw back any landing partiesbefore they could, form a bridgehead. As the enemy had air superiority, command of the sea and possessed the necessary landing craft, he was in a position to choosehis point of invasion, while the disparity between the length of perimeter and numbers available to hold it, meant shallow defence on the shores. All the moreimportant then, not only to keep in hand an adequate reserve but to organise forimmediate counter-attack to meet any of the possible landings open to the enemy.The problem of ensuring sufficient artillery support for these alternative counter-attacks was complicated by the difficulty of finding suitable gun positions, bya shortage of necessary instruments and. telephone wire, owing to losses on the mainland, and, of course, complete absence of aerial observation. Finally, it wasto be expected that enemy could make his attempt under cover of darkness.In the face of these difficulties it was obvious that every hour would haveto be utilised to the utmost if the forces on the Island were to have any reasonable chance of holding out against an enemy who had proved conclusively on the mainland his talent for speed in operations. It could be presumed that he fully appreciated the importance of making his attempt on the Island before we had time to reorganise, rest and re-equip.The majority of the troops who withdrew onto the Island were very tired.The 11th Indian Division in particular had been in action almost continuouslyfrom the battle of Jitra in the extreme North to the southern end of the peninsula.They had fought what amounted to rearguard actions for a distance of over400 miles. They had suffered heavily, but their spirit was good and even a shortrest would have made them again a first-rate fighting formation; but rest,unfortunately, they were not to have, for they had been allotted a sector of theNorth and North-East shore, including the Naval Base area, where no defenceshad been prepared, and the men, immediately they crossed the Island, were set to work digging and wiring. Both Commanders and men, after the strain of sevenweeks&apos; fighting, had expected to find at least some positions prepared in what wascommonly, and erroneously, known as the &quot;Fortress&quot; of Singapore. That theyprepared their sector effectively is proved by the speedy destruction of twoattempts at landing in their sector, though these admittedly were not made in strength. In one case a tow of landing craft was entirely destroyed by artillerybefore reaching the shores; in the other, the tug and a proportion of the bargeswere sunk.Like the 11th Division, Major-General Cordon bennett&apos;s Australians were strong in their criticism of what they regarded as criminal negligence on the partof the Malaya Command in not preparing defences in the West and North-west of the Island.   Though little is known of the extent of preparation made m this
sector between the 31st January and the Japanese landing on the night8th/9th February, wire was apparently erected and M.Gs. sited some way back from the shore, while trenches were, dug in the rubber plantations still furtherfrom the sea.As the behaviour of some at least of the Australian troops in this area hasbeen the occasion of strong comment and as recrimination is likely to have unfortunate repercussions, besides playing into the hands of the enemy, it isnecessary to set out plainly the facts of the case so far as they are known.The A.I.F. had displayed in North Johore a refreshingly offensive spirit ata period when this was sorely needed to counter the effects on morale of constantwithdrawal and defeat. They brought off some highly successful ambushes overground they had had the opportunity of studying during the time they had occupied the area; but against the enemy&apos;s superiority in numbers, and his ability to outflank by landings on the west coast, these successes brought no morethan a temporary improvement and the Australians were soon themselves very severely handled in a series of actions near the west coast, notably at Par itSulong and about Batu Pahat and Muar. Thereafter a rapid decline must have set in, because signs of a break in morale were noticeable even before the Japaneselanding in their sector. Large numbers of A.I.F. stragglers were seen in thetown; many undoubtedly took the opportunity to desert in boats to Sumatra.Finally, the events of the night 8th/9th February seem to have destroyed almost completely their discipline and morale.In justice, however, it must be recorded that they were subjected on that night to a bombardment which, judged by the standard of any theatre of war, canonly be described as very heavy; in addition, they had been under an only slightly less heavy pounding for at least twenty-four hours.The 18th Division from Home, except for the 53rd Brigade, which precededthem by a fortnight and fought in Johore, had not been in action. They werefresh and their morale was excellent, but they were unacclimatized and ignorantof jungle ways. Their experience, when they went into action for the first time,was that of all the reinforcements and formations which arrived in Malaya afterthe outbreak of hostilities, namely, being rushed into action, soft and untrained,with the result that many a fine battalion was soon reduced to a collection of foot-sore, tired and depressed men. It was unfortunate, but the situation demandedit. In being broken up (53rd Brigade to Johore in&apos; advance, the detachment ofThomforoe, the formation of Massyforce), the 18th Division was also sharingthe experience of every formation which fought in Malaya. Shortage of men,lack of advance information as to reinforcements and a succession of highlycritical situations, were the reasons for a policy which was very strongly &quot;criticised by every commander in the force. In conjunction with this type of warfare, thesplitting up of formations and their committal to battle untrained, led to aspeedier loss of fighting efficiency than in any previous campaign in whichImperial forces have been engaged.The 9th Indian Division, originally comprising only the 8th and 22ndBrigades, lost the latter entirely in the course of withdrawal to the Island fromthe East coast.From the 1st February to the landing on the night 8th/9th Japanese activity was confined to intermittent shelling, bombing still on a moderate scale andaerial reconnaissance. On about the 4th February they commenced taking an interest in Pulau Ubin, which guards the eastern entrance to Johore Strait.This Island is 4 miles long, extending from Changi to Serangoon village on the mainland and distant from 1 to 1^ miles from the Singapore shore. On theJohore side of the Island the channel narrows in places to 800 yards.There is little doubt that their movements on Pulau Ubin were a feint, partlysuccessful, to divert our attention from the large-scale landing in preparation atthe western end of the strait. Their activity consisted in sending parties on tothe Island, where our patrols from 18th Division and from the Gordons atChangi met and exchanged shots with them. The use of Seletar aerodrome wasdenied us from now on by fire across the Strait.Up till now there had been an ominous absence of news from the western endof the Strait, where the passage is little more than half a mile wide at one point.A.I.F. units in this Western, sector (between the Sungei Jurong and SungeiKranji) appeared to be taking little interest in the opposite shore, in spite of[24104] ^ D
requests from Malaya. Command that patrols should be ferried over under cover of darkness. Inactivity of the commanders in this sector is the more inexplicablein that sounds of hammering had been heard at night across the water. Even-tually, on the evening the 8th/9th February, an officer&apos;s patrol was carried acrossand he reported large concentrations of Japanese in areas bordering the far shoreand discovered that work on rafts was in progress.. This information reachedCommand Headquarters only when the landing was in progress. It is. difficultto understand why the significance of the bombardment which commenced at leasttwenty-four hours before the invasion was not fully appreciated. The fire fromguns and mortars has been estimated as a medium, heavy or very heavy bombard-ment and reaching a crescendo between 8 and midnight on the 8th. Inside theplantations, where most of the trenches were sited, the rubber trees split and fellabout the men. On the shore, among the mangroves, at least a company of Chineseguerrillas, their British officers in touch with the Australians, were watching.Beach and searchlights had been installed,&apos; but they.,were under the control of thelocal Infantry Commander, and he had forbidden their exposure without a personal order.  The order was never given.Once ashore, the first Japanese parties, estimated at about a thousand, were-soon working their wa)&apos; inland, for there was so very little opposition near the beaches that the Chinese guerrillas found themselves entirely unsupported amongthe mangrove&apos;. Similarly, next morning the left flank of 11th Division roundWoodlands was exposed, and they were obliged to put in two counter attacks toretake an important feature near the main road.The next phase was a steady drive, though not in strength, towards thesouth-east, with the bulk of the A.I.F. retiring into the area west of the lineBukit Timah-Bukit Panjang. To meet this situation a portion of the 18thDivision was detached, moved to the vicinity of Bukit Timah village and placed under command of Major-General Gordon Bennett.A counter attack had been staged for the morning of the 11th February to drive the enemy back from the line of the Sungei Jurong-Sungei Kranji. GeneralGordon Bennett had issued his orders, but the attack had never materialised,though one Indian Brigade, at the southern end of the line, reached their objectivealmost unopposed, but withdrew on finding themselves unsupported. This fiascomarked the beginning of the end. It was plain now that there were neither thenumbers nor the will to throw the enemy back into the sea. Apart from this,the detachment of 18th Division known as Thomforce, fresh and full of fight, had made two gallant attempts to retake Bukit Timah and Bukit Panjang villages,but the enemy strength was growing rapidly, and he had landed Tanks on the island. Thomforce was obliged to move for the night to the Race Course, East oftheir starting line. Meanwhile, the remainder of the 18th Division, moved fromtheir sector between Seletar and Changi, were preparing a new position aboutAdam Road.. This was occupied on the 13th, the line being continued to the seaat Pasir Panjang by the remnants of the A.I.F., British units and the MalayRegiment. To the north and west, 11th Division, Fortress troops and the depleted9th Division were drawn in, in conformity with the new adjustment nowcompleted on the west. The whole force, with the exception of the Coast Artilleryon Blaking Mati Island and the garrison of the isolated hill fort of Pengerangon the mainland, was now on a restricted perimeter round the town of Singapore.As petrol was fired and ammunition dumps blown up (with those &quot; last rounds &quot;)the feeling grew that surrender could only be a matter of days at most.Meanwhile the enemy had not neglected the civilian, whom he had bombedwith ever-increasing severity since the 10th February. Shell fire had finallybroken down the stoicism of the Chinese--up till now the most steadfast of theAsiatics. As to water, ammunition and food, there is a conflict of evidence. Halfof the McRitchie Reservoir, including the distributing plant within the AdamRoad position, certainly remained in our hands, and there were in addition otherunexploited sources available, but even taking the most optimistic view, it wouldseem that the existing chaos within the town, added to damage from bombing,must soon have caused a serious shortage. For the troops there were said to be only a fortnight&apos;s rations owing to the heavy losses sustained in the dumps onthe mainland. The civil authorities announced, within a few days of theCapitulation, that food supplies were ample for the population of Singapore, but when the inevitable damage from bombing is taken into account, so favourable anestimate is hardly to be accepted.
Three-quarters of a million panic-stricken Asiatics in a ravaged and blazingtown,&apos; a pall of black smoke visible for 40 miles and a ring of tired and dispiritedtroops; such is the picture when the &quot;All Clear&quot; sounded on the evening of15th February.7. Conclusion.The results of being forced, unprepared, into a world war have a way ofmaking themselves felt unexpectedly, in awkward quarters and at awkwardjunctures. The greater the disparity between responsibilities and means, thegreater the risk of disaster. Malaya is a tragic example of the truth of theseplatitudes.It was as though someone had dropped a time bomb which had lain for solong in the ground that it was being commonly counted, a blind, but, even if itwere not a dud, counter-measures could be so easily devised that it would be aswell if the thing did go off and remove the threat once and for all. The bombwas Japanese preparation for mastery of East Asia and the shock which startedthe mechanism was the outbreak of war in the West in 1939, while the secondjolt which accelerated, the&apos; wheels was the collapse of France. The danger was now much more real, but with America certain to come.to our help, Japaneseaction could in the end be nothing short of suicide. And so it will be, but in themeantime she has made gains beyond her wildest hopes and has not yet come to-the end of her successes. There was Pearl Harbour, then the sinking of our ships,then, most surprising of all, her nine-week drive from Thailand to Singapore.That seems to be where our calculations broke down. We must have known shewas capable of and even likely to take suicidal risks but at the worst we countedon holding her long enough on the peninsula to allow of the tables being turned.We had to accept the risk of her attacking in superior force, but we did notrealise the extent of her preparations or the margin of superiority she was to enjoy in every direction.  We cut it too fine.She had to reach Singapore in 9 weeks or net at all.

Thomforceonly troops at end showing cohesionand will to attack, though seriouslyhandicapped by lack jungle training and unacclimatized.This is not so. On the regular beachdefences the system was in depth and very sound, i.e., Changi, Siglap, &amp;c.The North and West shores, as fully explained elsewhere, are not goodexamples, as improvised at last moment.In any case, strength of troops at endwould not allow of deep defence roundwhole coast. Principle is hold on beachwith minimum and eject landing byimmediate and overwhelming counter-attack.Why so pessimistic an outlook?Commander certainly did not expect tohave to fight south of Batu Pahat-Ayer Hitam. Shows misunderstand-ing of whole raison d&apos;etre of naval base and policy. Admitted; as precau-tion Northern shore defences shouldhave been put in hand. No labour. Allsappers in North. Considered moralewould suffer if suggested at early stage that we should be driven on to Islandthus early.This (see above) shows a misunder-standing of the factors bearing on thedefence of the Naval Base.Admitted that assessment of casual-ties very difficult, but, allowing for this,there is no doubt that casualties inkilled and wounded on the mainlandwere not heavy. One estimate asreliable as can be expected under thecircumstances -put A.I.F. killed and wounded on the mainland at under 300.
&quot; Conduct of Defence of SingaporeIsland.&quot; Defences- of Island divided into3 sectors .... western A.I.F. and44th Indian Brigade.(2) Work immediately commencedpreparing positions; soon realisedcoastline could only be thinly held.&quot;&apos;&apos; Night the 4th / 5th February patrolencountered large enemy concentrationsmainland overlooking Straits Johore.&quot;(4) The 7th February enemy aircraft and artillery started bombardment.Concentrated attention on Head-quarters and roads western sector.....Defences destroyed. Information that night enemy had landed large force.Two battalions holding position over-run.&quot;It has been difficult to ascertain how much work was actually done on theA.I.F. sector, though there is generalagreement that it was not well pre-pared. One officer speaks of seeingwire in coils being carried away fromthe position.Paragraph (2) shows misunderstand-ing of general principles for defendingany long perimeter, and SingaporeIsland in particular. They are:(1) Sufficient fire power at the water&apos;sedge to make landing very hazardous.(2) A counter-attack plan for imme-diate destruction of any enemy whogets ashore. Obviously, with fightingtroops available and a total shore lineof about 80 miles, the counter-attack was of first importance.There is a conflict on this point andit is a matter which had a markedbearing on the events of the next fewdays. A senior Staff Officer (G.S.) has stated that Fortress Command madeunsuccessful efforts to persuadeGeneral Gordon-Bennett to send patrolacross the Johore Strait to ascertain whether or no the Japanese weremassing on the opposite shore.Finally, on night the 8th/9thFebruary an A.I.F. patrol did cross the strait and discovered large numbersof Japanese concentrated on the oppo-site shore and rafts prepared forferrying them.It was then too late. .The informa-tion reached Command Headquarterswhen the enemy was in process of landing.It is difficult to ascertain whatoccurred at the time of the Japaneselanding and for some hours previously.Description of the Japanese bombing-varies between .&quot; very heavy &quot; to&quot;nothing much.&quot; The beach lightswere never exposed because the localinfantry commander had given strictorders that this was not to be done without his permission.As the state of defences of the troopsin the immediate vicinity of Japaneselanding is not accurately known, and,further, as it is difficult to judge the weight of this bombardment, it isimpossible to say whether or no theA.I.F. Battalions concerned shamefullyabandoned their positions, and thusallowed the enemy to land almostunhindered. An officer of the Chineseguerrillas co-operating with the A.I.F.Battalions in this sector has stated thatthey (the guerrillas) were kept &apos;&apos; in theair &quot; and suffered very severe losses.
&quot; Part Ten,&quot; Japanese forces onSingapore Island. In first attack onisland it seems enemy used one divisionagainst two battalions north-westsector island. Having created gap, hepoured troops this division towardsBukit Timah village.The   deciding   factor   is not   thenumber   eventually &apos; landed, but   thenumber of the first tows to secure a footing.&quot;Reserves thrown into counter- This is the only evidence of any effortattack, but unable to stem enemy on the part of the A.I.F. to hold up the advance. Japanese in this sector at this stage.On the other hand, there are statements to the exact contrary notably fromOfficers of the 11th Indian Division and chinese guerrillas.After conference with General Commander of Thomforce (formedWavell, line to be pushed forward easy from units of 18th Division) is of anstages on the 11th&quot; and 12th February, exactly contrary opinion, and, speakingThis impossible. with knowledge of conditions (he had come under Gordon-Bennett&apos;s com-mand), states that he did not see howit could fail with the artillery supportavailable.General Gordon-Bennett actuallyissued orders for this counter-attack,and on the 6th 15th Indian infantry brigade on extreme left started andgained their objectives, but later re-tired as no other formations or unitsco-operated &quot; owing to non-receipt oforders or something.&quot;Explanation needed as to why, ifcounter-attack was not practicable, theIndian Brigade in Westforce was allowed to proceed on the originalorders and why the A.I.F. did not participate.Brigadier Paris has confirmed onmorning 11th (see Thomf orce narrative)that the counter attack did not takeplace, and that since midday on theprevious day (10th February) therehad been no A.I.F. west of the BukitTimah road in the direction of theSunggi Kranji.Beyond any doubt morale and disci-pline had at this time gone to pieces.The news of the landing and the failureof counter measures had been the finalblow. The A.I.F., according toincontrovertible evidence, were affectedmore seriously at this crisis than someof the other units. The Commander,Westforce, issued his orders for a counter attack to be carried out on thev &apos; morning 11th February.One formation, at least, carried out their part; the A.I.F. did not. and inhis report the Commander says that the counter attack was impossible. Therecan be only one deduction.
&quot; (1) Contrary reports that natives-were unfriendly. Not one case of 5th Column activity was reported byA.I.F., Malaya, Chinese assisted asguides, provided food boats, &amp;c.&apos;&apos; During campaign in northdesertions of Malay volunteers were reported. Men of a Malay regimentcontacted by A.I.F. fought as well asIndian troops.&quot;&quot; (1) As martial law was proclaimed,Singapore civil authorities could notbe blamed for shortcomings.&quot;&quot; Part Fourteen, effectiveness demo-litions. (1) Reports revealed that inbeginning - campaign destruction ofproperty useful to enemy was notorganised, viz., Penang.APPENDIX &quot; B.&quot;i Criticisms.Some Common Criticisms on the Events in Malaya and a Suggested Reply.The name of Sir Shenton Thomas will go down to history as the mostabused Englishman and the Malayan Civil Service will be named as one of themost incompetent institutions which has ever existed.Among civilians generally the failure of the air force receives moreunfavourable comment than the inability of the. Army to hold the Japanese onthe mainland.For the fall of Singapore itself, the Australians are held responsible, while their presence in the town in disproportionately large numbers during the lastdays, coupled with the escape of large numbers on ships and in boats, has aroused great indignation.All criticism is mingled with bitterness and disillusionment.Most civilians resent what they regard as gross and calculated deception -on the part of Sir Shenton Thomas in that he repeated, both in public announce-ments and privately, assurances that there was no need to think of evacuationas Singapore would not fall.The conditions attending the evacuations, even the earlier ones, from a heavily bombed town created a feeling of disgust, though, in fact, the arrangements, allthings considered, were reasonably good. Warnings had necessarily to be given at snort notice to avoid word getting to the enemy. In any event, thousands of people left in big ships without a single casualty.This evidence applies only to JohoreState. Unquestionably Kelantan,Kedah. Perlis and Trengannu FifthColumnists abounded.Tamils, Malays, and Chinese were almost invariably ready to help our troops if the risk was not too great.Malays of the &quot;Volunteer Battalionsproved valueless and were disbanded,while those of regular regiment were good on occasions, i.e., Pasir Panjangon 12th, 13th, 14th February.The Civil administration retained alarge measure of control, even afterthe withdrawal of all force on to the island, and the unanimous verdict of senior staff officers is that an important factor in our failure in Malaya was thedifficulty of ensuring efficient co-opera-tion. Many prominent civilians(professional and businessmen) areunsparing in their condemnation ofthe Governor and administration.The enemy break through in Kedahwas so rapid and unexpected thatPenang was completely surprised.
There is no sympathy or understanding for the Governor in the impossible position in which he found himself. The civilian (and the better off, the louderthe complaint) says simply That he and his well-to-do friends should have been warned in good time and evacuated in comfort, together with cash and securities.The answer is to remind him of Penang and its aftermath, when the wealthyChinese waited on Sir Shenton Thomas with a protest that they and otherAsiatics were apparently in a different category from Europeans when it came to evacuation in the face of the Japanese invasion. They considered that theywere just as much entitled to the protection of the British Government.This was unanswerable and the Governor promised that in future nodistinction of colour, class or creed would be permitted.Critics fail to realize the effect which would have been produced by thestealthy withdrawal of the well-to-do, after the commencement of the Japaneseadvance.The only possible solution would have been to disregard morale and to have laid plans for a wholesale evacuation from up country as part of a defensiveplan.  It would, of course, have been greeted as defeatist and alarmist.Though it must be admitted that the behaviour of the Australians in thefinal phase was a very bad example particularly to Indian troops, it. is only fair to remember that they had been really heavily punished by shell fire on the night the 8th/9th and were in fact the only troops in the whole campaign tocome under heavy shell fire; secondly, a rumour got about that they were to be evacuated, and, lastly, they were near home and that home was under imminentthreat of invasion.While these are not justifications for desertion and indiscipline, they doexplain that glancing over the shoulder.
