f O o C* )THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 301-July 17, 1942.WAR CABINET.PACKING OF VEHICLES SHIPPED FROM THIS COUNTRY ANDFROM NORTH AMERICA.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.APART from a small number going to North Russia, no vehicles havehitherto been shipped from this country dismantled and packed in crates. InHay 1,126 out of 7,517 (15 per cent.) were shipped boxed. I hope that this isonly a beginning.The importance of this innovation is clear when we realise that the ships set free, instead of bringing back only one cargo from their long voyage to the East,will be able to bring us something like three cargoes on the short North Atlantichaul. Calculations show that boxing these 1,126 vehicles in May has increasedour potential imports by about 80,000 tons as much as the monthly savingachieved by raising the milling ratio, clothes and soap rationing and abolishingbasic petrol, all put together.Even at some inconvenience, all Departments concerned should thereforemake every effort to improve the method of packing vehicles shipped from thiscountry and from America, and to increase the proportion so packed; only inreally urgent cases should arguments against doing this be accepted.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,July 17, 1942.[24100]
