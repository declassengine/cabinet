(42) 195 (0).)July 2, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND  PCEYIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document18WAR CABINET.FUTURE OPERATIONS.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff.ON the 11th June the &quot;War Cabinet agreed*&apos; that -(a) We should not attempt any major landing on the Continent this year.unless we intended to stay there;(V) All plans and preparations for &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; should be pressed forward with the greatest vigour, on the understanding that theoperation would not be launched, except in conditions which heldout a good prospect of success;(c) The Chiefs of Staff should have authority to ask for the necessary shipping to be taken up for &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; on the 1st July, withoutfurther reference to the War Cabinet.2. We have now examined the full implications of implementing the above conclusions, and we think that the War Cabinet should be aware of them before a final decision is taken.3. As will be seen from the Note by the Minister of War Transport(Annex I) the shipping implications are as follows-(a) The withdrawal of the necessary ocean-going and coasting shipping, ifthe operation is mounted, carried out and maintained, will entail the loss of 950,000 tons of imports per annum.(b) If the operation is mounted, but is subsequently cancelled and the ships are returned to their normal employment immediately the decision is taken, we reckon that we shall incur a loss of three months carrying-capacity or approximately 250,000 tons.(c) The effect of removing the 200 coasters required would be to throw uponinternal transport 500,000 tons a month of additional freight, 70per cent, of which would be coal, and that this strain, aggravated by the concurrent demands of Bolero, will create a serious deficiency of internal transport during the winter.* W.M.

4. The Chief of Combined Operations has also submitted a note (AnnexII) in which he shows that the Combined Operation training of all units ofthe Home Forces which are not employed in &quot; Sledgehammer,&quot; and also of theUnited States forces arriving in this country, will come to a complete and immediate standstill as soon as we start mounting &quot; Sledgehammer.&quot; The effectof this will be to postpone operation &quot; Round-up &quot; for two or three months.5. At the War Cabinet meeting on the 11th June, the Prime Ministerlaid down, and the War Cabinet generally approved, that operations in 1942should be governed by the following two principles :  (i) No substantial landing in France in 1942 unless we are going to stay:and(ii) No substantial landing in France unless the Germans are demoralisedby failure against Russia.It seems to us that the above conditions are unlikely to be fulfilled and that,therefore, the chances of launching operation &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; this year areremote.6. It is true that there are certain military advantages in mounting&quot; Sledgehammer/&apos; even though it is unlikely to be launched. In the first place, our preparations are bound to keep the Germans guessing. They may not forcethem to withdraw troops from their Eastern Front, but they are unlikely to weaken their Western Front, particularly in air forces. Secondly, the mountingof &quot; Sledgehammer&quot; will be a useful dress-rehearsal for &quot;Round-up,&quot; especially for Commanders and Staffs.7. There can be no doubt that the disadvantages mentioned in paragraphs and 4 outweigh the advantages in paragraph 6. If we were free agents, wecould not recommend that the operation should be mounted..8. We have, however, given or subscribed to certain undertakings. In thefirst place, the following is an extract from the Aide-Memoire which the PrimeMinister handed to M. Molotov just before he returned to Russia :  &apos;&apos; We are making preparations for a landing on the Continent inAugust or September 1942. As already explained, the main limiting factorto the size of the landing force is the availability of special landing craft.Clearly, however, it would not further either the Russian cause or that ofthe Allies as a whole if, for the sake of action at any price, we embarked on some operation which ended in disaster and gave the enemy an opportunityfor glorification at our discomfiture. It is impossible to say in advancewhether the situation will be such as to make this operation feasible whenthe time comes. We can therefore give no promise in the matter, but.provided that it appears sound and sensible, we shall not hesitate to put our plans into effect.&quot;If we do not make active and serious preparations for &quot; Sledgehammer,&quot; theRussians are almost bound to know very soon that we are not fulfilling our promise that we would do so.9. Secondly, the following are extracts from the conclusions of a meetingrecently held in Washington between the President and the Prime Minister, and attended by General Marshall and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff:(i) Plans and preparations for the &quot; Bolero &quot; Operation in 1943 on as large a scale as possible are to be pushed forward with all speed and energyIt is, howe^ Ter, es essential that the United States and Great britain should be prepared to act offensively in 1942.(ii) Operations in France or the Low Countries in 1942 would, if successful,yield greater political and strategic gains than operations in any othertheatre. Plans and preparations for the operations in this theatre areto be pressed forward with all possible speed, energy and ingenuity.The most resolute efforts must be made to overcome the obvious dangersand difficulties of the enterprise. If a sound and sensible plan can becontrived, we should not hesitate to give effect to it. If, on the otherhand, detailed examination shows that, despite all efforts, success is improbable, we must be ready with an alternative.
10. If it were decided not to proceed with active preparations for &quot; Sledge-hammer,&quot; it would, be essential to inform the President and General Marshall^atonce that we had found it necessary to reconsider the above conclusion.11. On the other hand, if &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; is to be mounted, it is equallyessential that the Americans should be informed of the resultant delays to thetraining of their and our troops for &quot; Round-Up &quot; and the postponement of thatoperation.12. Our present instructions are to mount &quot;Sledgehammer,&quot; but beforeissuing the necessary orders we wish the War Cabinet to be aware of the implications.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.C. F. A. PORTAL.A.

[C.O.S. (42) 192 (O).June 30, 1942.]Operation &quot; Sledgehammer.&quot;Note by Minister of War Transport.AT a meeting* of the Chiefs of Staff Committee on the 24th June, I was invited to circulate a memorandum for consideration by the Chiefs of Staff on the1st July showing the implications of taking up the shipping required for&quot; Sledgehammer.&quot;2. My Department has been informed orally that the &apos;&apos; lift&apos;&apos; required byC.C.O. is the same as that notified last May, namely (a) 100 medium and large coasters (for an average of 30 M.T. vehicles each).t(b) 100 small coasters (for stores total lift 20,000 tons).(c) 30 ocean-going cargo ships (for an average of 100 M.T. vehicles each).(a) 1,000 dumb-barges (for an average of 2^ M.T. vehicles each).(e) 30 Cross-Channel type passenger vessels\ (12 as Auxiliary InfantryAssault ships and 18 as personnel carriers average 800 men each).(/) 500 deep-draught towing craft.(g) 250 shallow-draught towing craft.3. With reference to requirement at 2 (b) above, although the demand is for100 small coasters with a total lift of 20,000 tons, it is necessary for reasons ofreliability of winches and engines that vessels of an average of 400 tons capacityshould be allotted; 50 vessels of this type can lift 20,000 tons on the requireddraught. It is, therefore, suggested that if only 200 tons per ship can be discharged on one tide the vessels should remain on the beach for two tides; the eventual risk under these circumstances might be less than if a 100 vessels were used for one tide each.4. The withdrawal of 30 ocean-going ships paragraph 2 (c) means interms of imports a loss of about 500,000 tons per annum. For reasons of carryingefficienc)7, it would be necessary to employ as part of these 30 ships some 20vessels now engaged in carrying war supplies from the United Kingdom and united States to overseas destinations; this would involve an annual reductionin the movement of these supplies of about 200,000 tons. Firm notice of therequirements for ocean-going ships must be given at least six weeks before thedate of the operation, if wasteful delays are to be avoided.5. The 1,000 dumb-barges paragraph 2 (d) have been taken up and arenow being converted by the Admiralty.6. The required number of cross-channel passenger ships paragraph2 (e) can be made available, though some curtailment of the civilian sailingsbetween the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and Eireis inevitable. The 12 vessels required as Auxiliary Infantry Assault ships havealready been taken up for conversion, and the 18 personnel carriers are earmarked.7. It is understood that the Admiralty will provide the 500 deep-draughttowing craft paragraph 2 (/).  8. The Admiralty will also provide as many as possible of the 250 shallow-draught towing craft paragraph 2 (g).   We will furnish the remainder.9. The effect of removing the 200 coasters required under 2 (a) and 2 (&amp;)would be to throw upon internal transport 500,000 tons a month of additionalfreight, 70 per cent, of which would be coal. It is considered that inland trans-port could accept a large part of this burden during the summer but, in orderto ease the strain (i) it would be necessary to make greater use of the East Coast* C.O.S. (42). 188th Meeting, Minute 3.f Originally 150 coasters for an average of 20 vehicles each.^ These are exclusive of 10 similar vessels already on C.C.O.&apos;s service.
ports (including London) for ocean-going vessels, and (ii) it might be necessaryto use a certain number of ocean-going steamers on coastal service, with a consequent loss of imports at the rate of about 450,000 tons per annum. Mean-while, suitable coasting vessels are being earmarked and action is being takento improve the loading and discharging gear of those required to. lift M.T.vehicles, as six weeks* will be required to prepare and move to their loading ports the full number of ships indicated.The strain on internal transport will be increased by the concurrent demandsof &quot;Bolero.&quot; The continuance of the strain during the winter will create aserious deficiency of internal transport.10.. Although these initial demands can be met it is essential that carefulconsideration should be given to subsequent developments and to the shipping-requirements they would involve. At present we are asked to assume that overa period of two or three weeks the wastage of merchant ships and craft employedmay amount to 50 per cent, and that the remaining 50 per cent, would suffice for&apos; the maintenance of the Forces landed. If, however, the operation is todevelop into a major invasion, it seems that indefinite and much greater liabilitiesupon our shipping resources will be entailed. I wish to press that fullerconsideration should be given to this point at once.11. It should also be borne in mind that if casualties to craft approximateto the figure given, cross-channel type passenger steamers could not be providedfor a similar operation on the same scale either this year or next.12. It is assumed that the Chief of Combined Operations has satisfiedhimself that beaching operations of the magnitude contemplated, and with commercial craft of the type to be employed, are, in fact, practicable under theconditions likely to be encountered. Certain trials have been held but not on alarge scale, nor with loaded vehicles. Further trials with the new gear nowbeing fitted in the coasters are essential. It is problematical whether cargoes of loaded M.T. vehicles could be successfully discharged and handled on thebeach. In any event, the beaching of large ocean-going ships might well lead tothe loss of the ships. It is considered that ships of this type should not be useduntil harbour facilities are available.13. No insuperable difficulties are anticipated in regard to port facilities on the South Coast to provide for an operation of the size envisaged, providedthat T.L.Cs. and barges are all loaded at hards or on beaches and not at berths.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 30, 1942.* Subject to delivery of blocks and trunnions.[C.O.S.

(42) 194 (O)June 30, 1942.]ANNEX II.Certain Implications of Mounting Operation &quot; Sledgehammer.&quot;Memorandum- by Chief of Combined Operations.IN accordance with C.O.S. (42) 61st meeting (O), Minute 2, I forward, forthe information of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, the following notes on the implications of mounting operation &quot; Sledgehammer.&quot;Landing Craft Implications.2. By hypothesis the operation would employ all the landing craft in theJnited Kingdom that are operationally fit. The movement to assemble theselanding craft on the south coast must begin forthwith, and from now onwardsthey will have to be employed exclusively on training the &quot; Sledgehammer &quot;force, and subsequently on waiting at their final assembly positions for theoperation.
Effect on A rmy Training.3. Since the troops to be employed on &apos;&apos; Sledgehammer &apos;&apos; must be chieflydrawn from units which have already completed preliminary combined operationtraining, it follows that the training programme for further units of home forces will come to a complete and immediate standstill. This interruptionwill continue until after the operation is carried out or cancelled, say, for aperiod of two to three months. Furthermore, the concentration of trainingefforts on the &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; force will occupy the time of all traininginstructors, &amp;c, and thus delay the opening of the new C.T.Cs. on which the combined operational training of the United States Forces largely depends whenthey arrive in this country.Effect on Natal Training.4. The effect on naval training will also be most unfavourable. although a limited number of landing craft which are not operationally fit will be leftup north, and could be used for the training of naval personnel, the need to employ instructors for the &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; force will prejudice their use forthis purpose.Effect on 1943 Operations.5. The present training programme (i.e., not allowing for &quot; Sledge-hammer &quot;) can only just meet the training requirements for &quot; Round-Up &quot; bythe lare spring of 1943. It therefore follows that the interruption referred toabove cannot fail, either to delay the date by which the operation could be launched next year, or to reduce the size of the assault force, available by thepresent target date. While it is difficult to give precise figures, I estimate, veryroughly, that the delay wrould amount to approximately three months, or,alternatively, that the operation would have to be launched with a trained assaultforce amounting only to 5 divisions, as opposed to the 8 at present visualised.Shipping.6. The effects of taking up the large volume of shipping required for&quot; Sledgehammer &quot; have already been brought to the notice of the Chiefs oi Staff.Effect on Raiding Operations.7. It would obviously be impossible to mount any large-scale raid duringthe period we were preparing for &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; unless they could be carriedout by switching a part of the *&apos; Sledgehammer &quot; force to carry them out as analternative. While this is a possibility which should not be excluded, there isAery real danger that it would result in the raiding force being inadequatelytrained either for &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; or for the raid.Conclusion.8. It will be seen from the foregoing that the implications of mounting an operation on the scale of &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; at the present juncture wou\d be most serious, and in my judgment they should not be accepted unless there is a firm intention of actually carrying out the operation.(Signed) LOUIS MOUNTBATTEN,Chief of Combined Operations.Great George Street, S.
