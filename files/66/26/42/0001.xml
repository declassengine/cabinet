(&amp;- 0 /% a)(TILTS D0OTB1EMT IS THE HIOEERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 3 GOJ^MT)^P. (&amp;) 3122jrd July, 19A2COPY NO.VfAR   CABINET\REDUCTION OF THE HOURS OF BROADCASSDHfGMemorandum by the Minister of Information1r    I submit for the approval of the War Cabinet the proposal that asfrom the end of next September the B.E.C,s home service should close down at10,30 F&apos;ra&quot; instead of at midnight as at present.   My reason for this proposals is that I think the earlier closing down would act as a striking and constantreminder of the importance of fuel economy.2,    The saving in fuel likely to be effected would not be considerable sincethe fuel consumed in transmission is negligible.   Furthermore, it is impossibleto do more than guess at the amount of fuel that would be saved in the country if people were to go to bed earlier..   The listening audience for the B.B.G.midnight news- bulletin is estimated at 2-3,- million and the total number ofpersons who do any listening between 10,30 p.m, and the close of the midnightbulletin is not less than 6 million.   Of these it is obvious that a considerablenumber is staying up anyway because they are at work or on duty.3.    There seems to be two main arguments against the adoption of this proposal,Ihey are;-(a,) that-it would afford a good opportunity for enemy broadcasting toincrease its influence in this country;(b) that the maintenance of the B.B.C, programmes up till midnight aids in supporting public morale at home during the Winter months and amongpeople whose work or duties keep them up,k.    As to (a)f I do not think that this danger is appreciable,   I believe thatwe may saf ely trust the people of this country to be impervious to propagandaover the Axis radio.   There will always be a tendency among certain people totune-in to enemy broadcasts at certain times, such as those when news from our side of important events is lacking or when individual circumstances makepeople hope to hear information of a captured friend or relative.   Moreovermusic of good quality is readily available from several enemy stations and this may claim a proportion of listeners who need relaxation.   Apart from this I donot think that we ought to fear the consequences of an hour and a half lessbroadcasting a day; and anybody who filled in the gap by turning to the Axisradio would be likely to acquire a somewhat guilty conscience in the process.5.    As to (b) ? I am oonscious that people will be deprived of an amenity.But this will help to bring home to people the urgency of the war situationand the importance of fuel economy,6* It is this last consideration which leads me to recommend this step. Itwill &quot;bring constantly before the minds of a large proportion of the listeningaudience that the Government is in earnest in its insistence upon fuel economy.7.     I have consulted the Minister of Fuel and Power who is ready to concur inthis proposal.   The Chairman and Board of Governors of the B.B.C. have also assured that they are ready to implement whatever decision the Government thinks righthi the matter, although they do attaoh much importance to the danger of the enemy ^talcing advantage of the vacant time by putting on special musical programmes andnews bulletins for listeners in this country.   Having regard, however, to thevarious important&quot; issues involved- it seemed to me that I should bring the matter to the attention of the War Cabinet before any final decision is announced.Julyfl 19^B, B,
