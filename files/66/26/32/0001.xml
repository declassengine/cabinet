Rear-Admiral Brind (A.C.N.S. (Home)) and Air Vice-Marshal Slessor(A.C.A.S. (P)) reported to us on the 2nd July. We have studied their reportcarefully, and we now submit our views to the War Cabinet.3. We wish, at the outset, to emphasise that this enquiry originated from the concern which the Admiralty felt about the shipping situation, and the Committeeconstituted was not in a position to report on paragraph (c) of the terms ofreference. The scope of this paper, therefore, only covers the question of theprovision of aircraft for the war at sea.The requirements of aircraft for co-operation with the land forces is aseparate subject, now under discussion between the General and Air Staffs.4. In arriving at our Conclusions we have taken into account that the Navyis already stretched to the utmost and that the shipping losses are dangerouslyMgh. These losses not only menace the import situation of the United kingdom but absorb a high proportion of the productive capacity of the United Nations;they most seriously restrict our ability to nourish and reinforce our forces overseas,and also hamper dangerously our future strategy.[24118] bPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1942.
5.   There has been throughout our investigation a recognition that the RovalAir Force shares with the Navy the responsibility for the security of Lcommunications within the range of shore-based aircraft. &apos;The only points at issue have been in what numbers, how and when thpnecessary air forces can be provided.The Home Area.6.   The primary and immediate need is for an increased number of lone-si range aircraft for anti-submarine patrols in the home area, particularly the Eav*     &apos;    Qf Biscay, as well as for reconnaissance aircraft for work with the Home Fleet, and^^p^^-6    toAmpose our blockade measures.   .- 7. The way in which we propose to provide these additional aircraft is to employ aircraft from Bomber Command, to supplement those already operatino-in Coastal Command until the Liberator-Fortress strength in Coastal Commandcan be brought up to the agreed minimum of 54 aircraft.8.   The additional aircraft will be drawn from two sources (i) Aircraft in Whitley Operational Training Units manned by crews whoare about to pass into operational squadrons and who will do lono--range flights in the Outer Patrol Zone as part of their passing-outtests; and(ii) Lancasters in operational squadrons in Bomber Command.9. As regards the Whitleys, the Whitley V, with additional tanks, hassufficient range to cover the Outer Zone (400 to 600 miles) and the crews about topass out from Operational Training Units are sufficiently skilled to enable themto undertake the work.10. As regards the Lancasters, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Bomber Command, will arrange for a certain number of Lancasters in operationalsquadrons to be taken off their normal operations and used for long-range anti-submarine patrols. This would be done, in general, at the expense of the miningeffort.11. The number of aircraft available each week for anti-submarine patrolsfrom these two sources will fluctuate according to the incidence of operational training Unit courses and the necessity for concentrating all available aircraftwhen very large-scale raids are to be made on Germany. It is hoped, however, towork up to a maximum of 50 sorties a week.12. We propose to supplement the resources of Coastal Command to meetthe requirements of long-range reconnaissance for the Home Fleet by theemployment of Bomber Command aircraft with General Reconnaissance Observers(preferably Naval) whenever the situation (P.Q. Convoy, movement by enemysurface vessels, &amp;c.) warrants it.Indian Ocean Area.13. We recognise the importance of meeting the requirements forreconnaissance and striking force in the Indian Ocean as soon as possible, as onthis will depend our ability to transfer the Eastern Fleet to the Pacific, or elsewhere.14. It is hoped that the minimum of 54 long-range general reconnaissance aircraft in Coastal Command will be exceeded by October, so that it will bepossible to start sending general reconnaissance Liberators to Ceylon in that month. It is proposed that the ground personnel and equipment of one squadronshould be sent out in the August W.S. Convoy, so as to arrive in Ceylon beforethe end of October. The aircraft could then be flown out so as to arrive aboutthe same time.15. We have, in addition, considered the provision of Beaufighter torpedoaircraft for the Indian Ocean. 15 Beaufighters are at present undergoingmodification by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for use as torpedo-carryingaircraft. After trials and the overcoming of teething troubles, which necessitatekeeping the first squadron at home for the present, it is proposed to order thepreparation of a tropicalised version of the aircraft, which would be available foruse in the Indian Ocean.
Aircraft Production.and the Provision of Equipment.16. A table showing revised requirements and an estimate of the rate ofDrovision of aircraft for the Home, Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Mediterraneanareas is attached, as an Annex, and we recommend that the requirements shouldbe met as early as possible.17. Most of the delays involved in making aircraft available for operations are caused by the necessity for fitting special equipment, e.g., A.S.V. and LeighiVht equipment or air cleaners for aircraft which have to be sent overseas. Thej.f,A.P. has from time to time been asked to expedite this work and its importance(has once more been brought to their notice.18. It has been suggested.that a definite priority should be laid down forthe aircraft required for sea warfare. We are informed that MA.P. are averse tolaying down a rigid order of priority for the production of equipment, since thispresents to the firms a ready-made excuse for delays in producing equipment lessurgently required. A far more satisfactory solution is to arrange a programme which takes into account the great importance which attaches to the provision of equipment which will help to secure our vital communications and, thereafter,to see that this programme is fulfilled.19. We agree that the present practice of engineering some aircraft sothat they can be equipped with the necessary special fittings to enable them to operate as effectively as possible over the sea or in tropical climates should beextended to all aircraft in.so far as this can be done without a serious interferencewith production.Equipment of Long-Range Fighters for the Alternative Role of Torpedo Bombers.20. We propose that a proportion of long-range fighters, both at home and overseas, should be equipped for the alternative role of torpedo bombers as soonas possible, provided the trials now in progress prove satisfactory and no produc-tion difficulties arise. The Commander-in-Chief, Coastal Command, is beinginvited to consider and report on the number that he wishes to be equipped forthis alternative role in his Command.Co-operation with the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.21. A Director of Air Co-operation is now being appointed in the Admiralty,who will work in closest collaboration with the Director of Operations (naval co-operation) in the Air Ministry. Each of these officers will, in his own Depart-ment. pay attention to all the requirements of efficient co-operation between theServices in the war at sea, including those relating to training, tactics andequipment.The Submarine Building Yards.22. Finally, we recognise the great importance of destroying the enemy submarines while they are building or refitting. The submarine building yardsare already in a high priority for the main bomber offensive and successful attacks have^ recently been delivered on them..CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS.23.   To sum up (a) Our proposals for meeting the immediate Admiralty requirements for additional long-range reconnaissance aircraft in the Home area are set out in paragraphs 7 to 12 above.(b) We propose to send one Liberator Squadron to Ceylon by the end ofOctober (paragraph 14).(c) We propose to send one Coastal Command Beaufighter Squadron,adapted for torpedo carrying, to the Indian Ocean as soon asmodifications and trials enable this to be done (paragraph 15).[24118] &apos;       B 2
(d) We recommend that the requirements of the Admiralty, as set out inthe Annex, should be met as soon as possible, and that the Ministryof Aircraft Production should be urged to hasten by every possible means the rate at which aircraft coming forward from productionbecome operational in units employed on maritime operations(paragraphs 16 and 17).(e) We recommend that the provision of equipment and apparatus requiredto complete the air forces that we have agreed as the minimum necessary for maritime requirements should be pressed forward withthe greatest vigour, and the programme should be so arranged to take into account the great importance which attaches to the provision of equipment which will help to secure our vital communications(paragraphs 18 and 19.)(f) We recommend that a proportion of long-range fighters, j)oth at homeand overseas, should be equipped for the alternative role of torpedo bombers as soon as possible (paragraph 20).(g) A Director of Air Co-operation in the Admiralty will, in future, workin closest touch with the Director of Operations (Naval Co-operation)in Air Ministry (paragraph 21).(Signed) ALAN F.

ANNEX
ANNEX.It must be clearly understood that this table is. NOT a firm forecast of the numbers of aircraft that will be operational on the datesshown. It is the organisation plan for the formation of new squadrons, and can only be an indication of the numbers of unit equipmentaircraft that should be in the squadrons during the months concerned. It is safe to predict that at any given date only about 75 per cent, ofthe aircraft shown as unit equipment in any programme will be available for operations; and unexpected set-backs due to circumstancesbeyond our control may result in delays in formation of squadrons. On this basis the table shows what is believed to be a conservative estimate.   As far as possible the units will be formed on an order of priority agreed between the Naval and Air staffs.Area.

Squadrons at 20 U,E. at home and 16 abroad.(h) This includes both M.R.G.R. (Wellingtons and Whitleys) and S.R.G.R. (Hudson). The figure also includes 72 non-A.S.V. Mediums, which have been loaned fromBomber Command.(t) 2 Hudson Squadrons and 1 Blenheim Squadron, the latter to be re-equipped with Wellington VIII.(j) Includes 2 Wellington lc Bomber Squadrons equipped and trained for torpedo dropping,(fc) 12 Beaufort, 24 Anson, 6 Maryland.(I) Re-equipping and expanding with Venturas (Bomber).(m) Includes Dutch Squadron.(n) The formation of squadrons overseas will depend to a certain extent on the availability of shipping. In order to form the full number of squadrons shown by april 1943 it may be necessary to give special priority in.overseas shipping to the R.A.F.(o) These will be aircraft of the South African Air Force. The Air Ministry are examining what aircraft can be included in this total to provide for the long-range andtorpedo-bomber roles.(p) There are now about 35 British and UniteiStates Liberators in or on the way to the Middle East. 32 Halifaxes are due to leave the United Kingdom shortly, and an american Heavy Bomber Group (35) is to leave the United States for the Middle East this month. All these aircraft, in addition to the Medium Bombers how in or onthe way to Egypt, will be available for action against targets at sea in the Mediterranean.(q) On the planned programme there will be about 53 British and United States heavy bombers in India by September. This programme may be seriously reduced bypresent developments in the Middle East.
