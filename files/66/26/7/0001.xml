THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON ATROCITIES.1. An authoritative presentation of the atrocities committed by theGermans and Japanese in Lidice, Poland, Nanking, Hong Kong and other places should:(a) Help to keep the people of the United Nations informed of the natureof our enemies, spurring us to renewed efforts to defeat them; and.(b) Serve to deter those committing the atrocities by naming their names and letting them know that they are being watched by the civilisedworld, which will mete out swift and just punishment on the reckoning day.2. Such an authoritative presentation could be made by a United. nations commission on Atrocities, headed by someone like former Chief Justice Hughes,and including outstanding representatives of the other United Nations, such asTolstoy of Russia, Del Vayo of Spain, Sforza of Italy, Holdsworth of England,and Dr. Wu of China. To avoid, any implications of propaganda, the personnel of the Commission should not officially represent their Governments, though theyshould be satisfactory to them. They should be persons of a world-widereputation for integrity and an ability to appraise the evidence.3.   The Commission should (a) Investigate the atrocities by taking  depositions, interrogating eye-witnesses and assessing all other available or obtainable evidence; and(b) Report to the United Nations, from time to time, on the shooting andmaiming of hostages and prisoners, the beating and torturing ofwomen and children, and the other violations of the fundamentalrights of human beings. The report to the United Nations should,wherever possible, name the persons who are responsible for theatrocities.[24024A]
