THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 600.December 19, 1942.WAR CABINET,EXTRATERRITORIALITY IN CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AS I informed my colleagues at the meeting of the Cabinet on the30th November, the Chinese Government proposed, as part of our treaty onextra-territoriality, that we should agree to abandon our position in the KowloonLeased Territory or &apos;&apos; New Territories &apos;&apos; acquired under the Convention for theExtension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898. I attach a map which shows the island of Hong Kong as originally ceded in the Treaty of Nanking of 1842, theadditional territory in the Kowloon peninsula ceded in the Peking Treaty of I860and the territory leased as an extension of Hong Kong territory in the convention of 1898 just mentioned. It is the latter area which the Chinese are now askingus to relinquish.2. Since extra-territoriality relates to special privileges in Chineseterritory, and since this area is, as stated in the Convention, an enlargement ofBritish territory, I instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador (after consultationwith the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the First Lord of the Admiralty)to inform the Chinese Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded theNew Territories as outside the scope of the present treaty. Sir H. Seymour so informed the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. T. V. Soong, on the14th December in the course of discussion on the provisions of the treaty.3. Dr. Soong made the points that the Chinese public regarded leasedterritories as in the same category as concessions, that the matter had been raised in the People&apos;s Political Council (a representative body corresponding roughlywith Parliament), that it was desirable to remove all causes of misunderstandingsbetween the two peoples and that the Chinese Government felt that a treaty which did not secure a settlement of the Kowloon lease question would fail to achieve this object. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also pointed out that theChinese Government had refrained from raising the question of Hong Kongitself.  He requested that these views be conveyed to His Majesty&apos;s Government.4. A private and personal suggestion was subsequently received from aChinese official of standing to the following effect : that the Chinese Governmentshould address to His Majesty&apos;s Government a communication stating that,while recognising that the question was not concerned with the matters now under negotiation, they desired to raise it later at a more appropriate time and thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should make a suitable response.5. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador fears that the Chinese Government may notbe satisfied with an answer which implies the continuance of the lease. He feels that the Chinese Government have placed themselves in a position over thisquestion from which they find it difficult and perhaps impossible to withdraw,and he recommends that a solution be found along the above lines.6.   Although I should prefer to adhere to the plain statement that this isnot a matter which His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to discuss at thepresent time, a rigid insistence upon this would be likely at least to delay the11930   [24790]

2signature of the treaty and possibly cause the Chinese Government to refuseto sign at all. The United States Government, who have now virtually completed their negotiations, are proposing to the Chinese Government signature on the1st January. I would see advantage in our concluding our treaty also in timefor signature on that date, or as soon as possible thereafter. We can expect inany case no support from the United States Government in a refusal to discussthe question of the New Territories. Further, since it is inevitable that afterthe war we shall at some stage be obliged to discuss the future of the NewTerritories, not to mention Hong Kong itself, I recommend that we should informthe Chinese Government that we shall be prepared to discuss the future of theNew Territories when victory has been won. I request the sanction of mycolleagues for instructions to Sir H. Seymour authorising him to seek a solution on these lines.A. E.Foreign Office, December 19, 1942.
