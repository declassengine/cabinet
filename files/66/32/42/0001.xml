22. When receiving your message the subject was again discussed withDarlan with a view of giving publicity not only to accomplishments, but toannouncing aims. Darlan is particularly grateful to Mr. Roosevelt for realisingand mentioning the existence of a local Jew-Moslem problem which is full of explosive possibilities unless carefully handled. Darlan is in favour of a public announcement that definitely aligns him on the side of Liberal Government andopposed to Axis and what it stands for.3. It is my belief that the place and method of issue of the statement can probably be decided better at home by appropriate authority than here. However,I wish to make the following suggestion : After sending the complete text, I could make the announcement here at a fixed time in order to get effect of a statementcoming from a military theatre of operations. Then if, almost or actually simul-taneously, the President could take notice of the statement by commenting inaccordance with his desires, we would presumably obtain world-wide andintensified coverage due to his action.4. We are working on a proposed announcement and will send text as soonas completed.ANNEX B.Note on the Reforms undertaken by the High Commissioner in french Africa.Immediately following the establishment of the High Commissariat and theorganisation of its services, the High Commissioner undertook to adopt and toexamine a certain number of decisions of a general and specific nature, all of themimbued with a liberal spirit or the desire to make up for certain injustices andto eliminate a certain number of arbitrary decisions which had, on the whole, beeninspired by Germany.The problem as a whole can be considered under several headings : Social,Political and Racial.The Social Question.The social problem does not present itself in French Africa in the same manner as it does in France or in the United States. As a result, the task of theHigh Commissioner is considerably lighter.In North Africa there are only average-size towns and there is no industriallabouring class. Moreover, the Europeans in North Africa generally belong tothe leading class or they supply officials, directors, business men and skilledlabourers. The small requirements for local industrial labour are nearly alwaysmet with native workers. These labourers have really presented only one serious problem : the problem of wages.At the present time, and although the wage question is now being seriouslystudied by the Administration, the problem has assumed a different aspect.Generally speaking, the lack of goods on the market made it difficult for thenative to find ways of spending his money. It is therefore the problem of marketsupplies, and not the question of wages, which determines the state of the labour market.If cotton goods and certain food supplies can be brought to the Africanmarket, the social question as a result will be immediately solved. It is onlythen, and by way of result, that the problem of prices and wages will arise andthis problem will be considered with a more liberal outlook and with only oneconcern; the best possible prosecution of the war effort.The Political Question.By contrast the political question immediately presented itself under two principle aspects : Freedom of expression and individual freedom.Freedom of Expression.In the field of the press and editorial writing,.the French Government had.set up, immediately following the Armistice, a system of extremely rigidcensorship.   This censorship was specifically determined by the themes and therequirements of the propaganda of the Axis countries.
Since the High Commissariat was set up, these instructions were immediately done away with, and the press found it again possible to publishcommuniques and information from the Allied countries and to express theactual feelings of the French people with regard to the war.This complete change was accomplished simultaneously with a general systemmuch more liberal in character. Whereas earlier French censorship had reachedthe point of requiring publishers to print under their signatures articles whichwere entirely supplied by the Administration, the High Commissariat, asked thepress, as it was again given its freedom of expression, to furnish a considerablepersonal effort.The only instructions thereafter imposed upon freedom of expression arethose which are determined by the necessity of war, both from the military pointof view and the moral point of view, as well as for the Security of the allied armies now carrying out operations.Such is the practical situation which, in fact, prevails in other countries and which will have to be maintained until the end of hostilities.The same system will be applied to the publishing trade as soon as paperdeliveries will enable that trade to resume its.activities.Individual Freedom.- At the time of the intervention of the Allies in North Africa, a large numberof individuals who had been formerly arrested for political reasons, were eitherjailed and held in concentration camps or kept in labour battalions. All. theseindividuals had generally been condemned for the following reasons : Propaganda, manifestations or actions in favour of the Allies; hostilitytowards the Axis views; attempts to rejoin, the armies of the Allies or theformations of General de Gaulle; political propaganda against the FrenchGovernment or in favour of General de Gaulle.As soon as the High Commissariat was set up orders were given for thefollowing purposes : (a) To stop immediately all prosecutions before the courts for the breachesmentioned above.(b) To have all those condemned or detained for identical reasons immediatelyreleased. These various measures were applied gradually in such a manner that now all those politically condemned or detained are at liberty.. Since the 8th November, the only political arrests carried out were only foractions harmful to the war effort of the High Commissariat in French Africa or its Allies.Such provisions will, moreover, be maintained in the future.&apos; Finally, the High Commissariat went further. It even considered the liberation of certain individuals who had been arrested prior to the signing of theArmistice, that is to say, at the time when France and England were jointlypursuing the war against Germany. This case specifically involves twenty-sevenCommunist Deputies, who had been transferred to North Africa upon orders ofthe French Government at a time when the French Communist Party was alleged to hinder by its acts or propaganda the common war effort.No condition of a political&apos;nature was imposed for the liberation of these prisoners; they are merely requested to pledge themselves not to compromise,directly or indirectly, through their deeds, words or writings, and until the endof hostilities, the war effort being carried out in French Africa by the HighCommissariat and by the Allies.This pledge will remain valid until the end of hostilities.  .The Racial Question.The High Commissariat was likewise under the necessity of bringing somesolutions to the racial question. This problem is peculiarly serious in itself;it is even more so because of its political repercussions. In French Africa itassumes an entirely different aspect than in France.On the one hand the Jewish problem in North Africa presents itself underextremely varied aspects : the problem of the Moroccan Jews, and of the UnisianJews, which are under a special status.The Jewish problem also assumes the nature of a minority* problem which is extremely delicate : there are some 350,000 Jews living in French Africa faceto face with 25 million Arabs, who entertain towards them a spirit of more orless sharp hostility which is of long standing.[24815.] ^ b 2
These Mohammedans are the group from which the French Army in Africaj.s chiefly recruited and from which to-morrow will be drafted important effectivecontingents which will take part in the struggle at the side of the Allies.In spite of the difficult circumstances just indicated, the Jews of Africa havenever been subjected to the treatment inflicted upon their fellow-Jews in Franceand most specifically recently in the occupied zones (the wearing of the specialinsignia, curtailment of their right to travel, transfer of population, &amp;c.)Nevertheless, a certain number of special measures had been imposed on themin conformity with the legislation adopted in France since the Armistice&apos;:Political, military, cultural, property measures. In a certain number of cases,these, measures had been made more stringent in their application by theAdministration.The first step taken by the HighrCommissariat consisted in giving instructionsto the Administration in order that the existing laws should be interpreted in themost liberal spirit and not with stringency, as heretofore. Moreover, in a great number of cases, and particularly in everything involving individual prosecutions,it was simply recommended that the application of the laws and decrees be suspended.Simultaneously, the High Commissariat undertook an examination looking to the revision of these laws. Following are the principal points and conclusions which were decided upon by the services entrusted with this study.Military Problem.The legislation enforced had placed the Jews under a special status : AllJewish Officers and non-Commissioned Officers had been expelled from the Armyand the men were not called in the Regular Army.For the future, the provisions adopted are as follows : -(1) French Jews. French Jews will be recalled to duty under the same conditions as those prevailing for French Gentiles.Officers will be assigned on the basis of their branch or services.The Jews will also be allowed to sign voluntary enlistments.(2) African Jews. The African Jews of Algiers, whether subject to call ornot, will be allowed to sign volunteer enlistments with fighting units.( Volunteer officers, whether in the Regular Army or Reserve, whoformerly belonged to fighting units, will again be assigned to fightingunits not comprising any Arabs. The same process will apply to non-Commissioned Officers.Those called who are non-volunteers will be assigned to pioneerunits.All Jews, even foreign Jews, and those without nationality, willbe accepted as volunteers, either in the Foreign Legion or in the FreeCorps.Cultural Questions.The High Commissariat found itself face to face with the followingsituation : In most cases the Jews who had been dismissed from the schools had been replaced by Gentiles or Mohammedans. It was, therefore, impossible, withoutstirring up serious disorders, to consider dismissing from the schools theChristians and the Mohammedans in order to provide for the reinstatement andto make room for the Jews.However, the Jews had been allowed to organise a separate educational system.While waiting for circumstances which will permit the reopening of institu-tions now mostly occupied or evacuated, the High Commissariat will assist, ascompletely as possible, the separate Jewish educational system in order to permit a practical and immediate solution of the problem.Everything necessary will be done in the meantime to include in the Stateeducational system the most desirable Jewish elements.The decree of the 19th October, 1942, applying to Algeria, limits Jewishstudents to elementary and technical official examinations. A new text willauthorise such students to take the examinations for secondary schools.Jewish students thus admitted in higher education and who will have passedtheir examination satisfactorily shall no longer be subject to dismissal in thefuture through the-application of the quota regulations.Finally, the reinstatement of Jewish Professors and Teachers will be carriedout within the limits of the number of jobs available.
Property Regulations.Gradually, and in groups, Jewish owners and holders will have their pro-perty restored to them.Administrators who have been called to the Army will not be replaced; in thefuture, the provisions against property will no longer be applied.Finally, the restrictive interpretation of the law of the 2nd June, 1942(Article V), setting up the list of forbidden professions will be ended. For acertain number of professions, which are the most numerous, a great number of individual exceptions will be made in order to return to the situation prevailingformerly.In reference to the liberal professions, the Resident-General and theGovernor-General will be authorised to permit individual exceptions, which willbe valid for the duration of the war for any text involving the prohibition ofassignment or exercise of certain professions or functions, except those functionsinvolving the granting of public authority and under reservation of regulations to insure technical competence.In summary, the High Commissariat, in the different professions mentionedabove, followed the two following principles :-In the First Place.(a) Putting an end to any individual decisions, arbitrary and unwarranted;returning to the Jews the possession of their property and suspending alldispossessions contemplated; allowing the Jews to return to most professions, andin any event, to settle under the system of individual exception any case whichcould be considered as flagrant injustice; allowing Jewish children to havesuitable educational advantages; finally, allowing all of them to fight with theircomrades against the common enemy by returning officers to their ranks.All of these measures had one single purpose, to make up for abuses, put anend to arbitrary decisions and tolerate no persecution:In the Second Ploxe.(b) Avoiding, however, stirring up a sharp conflict among the Arabs andthe European population by abolishing the basic regulations which sought toreduce the considerable share of influence which the Jews had attained in Frenchpolitical life.To attempt to act otherwise at the present time would be to go counter to thesolution sought.It should be noted, moreover, that if the retention of these laws shouldprovoke among the Jews a certain number of protests, practically speaking, theirpresent status will not be seriously affected thereby. The whole political questionis summed up in the laws of the right&apos;of citizenship. Essentially, this right of citizenship consists in the right to vote; and this right to vote will not be exercised by Frenchmen until the end of hostilities.The High Commissariat felt, therefore, that it had no right to create, intime of war, throughout North Africa a conflict whose consequences would beincalculable in order to insure for the Jews a theoretical right, which at thepresent time and in fact is abandoned by all Frenchmen of their own full volition.Moreover, the High Commissariat cannot forget the basic problem of its mission,which is to contribute to victory and to put France in a position to decide freelyher own fate.The High Commissariat cannot assume the responsibility of hindering thewar effort by causing internal disorders and substituting itself for the free will of Frenchmen by modifying a law essentially political in nature and which theFrench nation alone is empowered to modify.The Commissariat is the less able to do so because of present circumstances it could not base its decision on the opinion of the majority of Frenchmen in north Africa. In so doing, the Commissariat would proceed to carry out a purelyarbitrary decision, similar to so many others which were urged upon the FrenchGovernment by Germany.If the Commissariat were to undertake such action, it would confirm the argument which is spread daily by the Axis radio to the effect that americans have broken their pledge not to take measures contrary to French sovereignty.It is important that the Commissariat should appear as a free Governmentwhich has joined freely in the effort of the Allies for the common cause.

Annex C.Comments on the Use of the Accompanying Note.We do not know whether American Authorities intend to use publicly theinformation contained in the appended note, and under what form such use wouldtake place. In case the Authorities do intend to use this note, we call their attention upon the following commentsLiberal measures adopted in favour of the press or of the publishing tradein general has been, and will be, favourably accepted by public opinion; thesame will be true, although with some reservations, concerning the measuresadopted in favour of political internees. On the other hand, the publicationof the different steps already taken, or being considered, in favour of the Jews,particularly if taken as a whole, will inevitably give rise to numerous reactionswhose consequences can be serious.The High Commissariat found itself in the following situation : For two years the official propaganda had daily repeated that the return of the Allies would mean the victory of the Jews. Since the 8th November, everyday and even several times a day, Continental France and the Axis countrieskeep insisting that, scornful of French sovereignty, the American Authorities in north Africa, or more precisely President Roosevelt himself, are determined toimpose upon the French Authorities a Pro-Jewish and Anti-MohammedanLegislation. This propaganda, in a country where in contrast with France theproblem, of races has always prevailed, where Algerian Jews represent onlyone half of one per cent, of the population, it is profoundly disturbing for publicopinion.   Considerable information gathered every day bears witness to this fact.It should be noted, moreover, that the High Commissariat was firmly resolved,acting with complete independence, to put an end to a certain number of injusticesand measures which were inspired by Hitlerian ideas. To solve this problem the High Commissariat has decided to proceed in most cases either throughAdministrative channels, or by way of individual exceptions granted in consider-able numbers. This method was subject to application with a certain amountof discretion. In addition, every one of these steps will be made public separately,rather than in a group. Thus a practical solution will be found for practically all problems which at the present time concern the Jews as individuals, whilesparing in the meantime, and as far as possible, the feelings of the european and Arab populations.We are not unaware of the fact that such a procedure leaves aside a certainpolitical aspect of these problems, a sort of official restitution which would be confirmed through publicity, but such a restitution would in fact have theappearance of a revenge, even as the confirmation of German theories wouldgive rise to a wide-spread concern and numerous conflicts.The gradual attainment of a different mood of public opinion, and later onthe achievement of victory, will undoubtedly make it possible to take a differentattitude.Finally, we are, in a state of war. All of our efforts must be aimed atmobilising, in unity, all the spiritual and material forces in Africa. this conclusion must remain foremost and above all others. Any publication, there-fore, of these measures involves the risk of compromising to a considerable extent the war effort.Moreover, it would be politically unwise at a time when all Mohammedancountries are on the Allied side to give widespread publicity to measures whoserepercussion would extend far beyond the frontiers of French Africa. We must,therefore, insist that this information should be used as discreetly as possible.If, however, contrary to our views, American Authorities should desire to make public measures taken by the High Commissariat in favour of the Jews, we insist that the text of this announcement shall be established in consultation with theFrench Authorities in such a way as to enable them to endeavour to limit theconsequences which would inescapably follow such a public announcement..
