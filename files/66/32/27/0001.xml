Of the singlewomen in this group over 90 per cent, are in industry, Civil Defence and theForces, and the corresponding figure for married women without children under 14 is. no less than 76 per cent. The percentages for ages 41-59 are naturallylower; a large proportion of the women in this age group who have ho young children have in their households sons and daughters (as well as husbands) whoare in industry.[24779][P.T.O.
2Note Prepared in the Prime Minister&apos;s Office.The Minister of Labour&apos;s figures dispel the idea that the 9 million so-called&quot; unoccupied &quot; women constitute an almost unlimited source of labour supply.Nearly 8 million are either over 41 years of age, or, if under 41, have children under 14 to look after. Of the remaining 1 million &quot;unoccupied,&quot; the great bulk are schoolgirls, students, unfit, pregnant, &amp;c.The following table shows the remarkable mobilisation achieved : Age.	&quot; Occupied &quot; in Industry, Forces, &amp;c.	&quot; Unoccupied. &quot;*	Proportion &quot; occupied.&quot;Single women  14-17        ...       ...... 18-40        ................ 41-50       ............... 51-59       ...      ...

Even among married women under 41, without children to look after, 8 in 10 are &quot; occupied,&quot; and of the remainder a large number arepregnant.It is planned by the end of 1943 to increase the number of women in industryand the Forces by the equivalent of 500,000 full-timers. Since the majority will only work part-time it will be necessary to obtain nearly 900,000 in all, of whomabout 600,000 will be married women over 41, over 200,000 married womenunder 41 and nearly 100,000 single women.
