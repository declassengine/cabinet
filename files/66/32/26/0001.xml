annex. -THE AXIS OIL POSITION IN EUROPE-NOVEMBER 1942.Report by Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.Attached is an interim Report by the Technical Sub-Committee on AxisOil, of which Sir Harold Hartley is Chairman, covering the six months ending the 31st October, 1942. The Report also includes a forecast of the position forthe six months ending the 30th April, 1943.2. We have nothing to add to the conclusions set out in Part &quot; A &quot; of theHartley Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, save that the Report appears to us to showthat the stocks of oil in Axis Europe have now fallen so low and the stringencyof the Axis oil position is such that . (a) any action that can be taken by the United Nations which will result in forcing the Axis substantially to increase the consumption of oilduring the coming winter may vitally limit Germany&apos;s strategiccapabilities. The most effective step would, of course, be to bringthe enemy to battle on as large a scale and on as many fronts aspossible. Where it is not possible to make the enemy fight it may be, possible by mounting threats and by skilful deception to induceGermany to maintain reserves of oil supplies in widely separatedareas, and thus increase the quantity of oil immobilised in transitand distribution;(&amp;) the effect of the removal of even a relatively small source of oil supply has now become out of all proportion to the intrinsic importance of the source itself. Therefore, the destruction of any of the synthetic oil plants may give a valuable dividend;(c) a crippling blow will be struck at the enemy&apos;s capacity to continue thewar if and when it becomes possible to interrupt the Roumanian source of supply or the means by which oil supplies from Roumania aretransported to Germany. Thirty-three per cent, of the total EuropeanAxis oil supplies come from Roumania. About one-third of theRoumanian production is consumed in Roumania itself, but thebalance is so important that the Roumanian refineries are by far the most important single oil target.3.

ENCLOSURE.INTERIM REPORT BY THE TECHNICAL SUB-COMMITTEE ONAXIS OIL.WE* are now engaged in the preparation of our Report on the Axis oil position, for the six months ended the 30th October, 1942. The present interim.Report sets out certain important conclusions that have already emerged from our enquiry.A.-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.1. German oil plans have been upset by the failure to attain the principalobjectives in the Caucasus. Supplies to the armed forces are being curtailed,civilian consumption has been reduced below the minimum efficiency level, stockshave become seriously depleted and the position is precarious.2. Evidence suggests that the Germans now consider that the reductions which have been made in civilian consumption have reached the point wherefurther cuts are more harmful to their war effort than restrictions in Serviceconsumption.3. By the middle of 1943 additional production at the rate of one million tons per year may be expected from synthetic oil plants now in course of erection.By the end of 1943 the output of synthetic oil may be further substantially increased.4. Reduced activity on the Eastern Front during the winter months might enable Germany partially to restore her depleted stock position. This would be unlikely to permit of the restoration of the cuts in non-military consumption whichhave been introduced during the previous six months, nor would it provide forthe mechanised exploitation of Occupied Russia in time for the 1943 harvest.The new synthetic production in mid-1943 might, however, enable a furthercampaign to be undertaken against the Caucasus in the latter half of next year.Provided the passage across the Black Sea can be safeguarded, the unhinderedexploitation of both the Maikop and Grozny fields, together with the newsynthetic production, would go a long way towards solving Ger-many&apos;s oil problemduring 1944.5. If the German Army is threatened this winter with a scale of warfare which would force it to consume oil at the same rate as during the winter of 1941/42, Germany may be compelled either to shorten her front and her lines ofcommunication in the East, or to impose a further drastic reduction in civilian consumption. Under the former alternative, Germany would have lost Maikop,but the resultant economies, in addition to the new synthetic production, would^Composition of the Sub-Committee.Chairman Sir Harold Hartley.Members Captain (E) J.

enable her to restore civilian supplies in Greater Germany to the minimumefficiency level, or to provide fuel for the 1944 Ukrainian harvest, but not both.Under the second alternative, a further drastic cut in civilian consumption would seriously affect industrial output.6. Roumanian oil, which at present provides 33 per cent, of the totalEuropean Axis oil supplies, remains a most vital factor in the German war effort.7. The German oil situation will be at its most critical stage between thepresent time and the middle of 1943.B. ARGUMENT.I. Introduction.1. The earlier Reports on the Axis Oil position in Europe which have beensubmitted by this and the Lloyd Committee have consisted mainly of statisticalanalyses of Axis oil production and consumption. The purpose of these Reportswas to show by this method the main trends both in Axis oil supplies and stocks,the latter being the most significant index of the Axis oil position. In the laterreports a comparison is made between the position as disclosed by the statisticalmethod and the general tenor of current Intelligence.2. The first evidence of serious embarrassment in the Axis oil position began to come in at the time when our statistical study led us to expect that serious embarrassment would, in fact, be felt. In the Eighth Report of the LloydCommittee the statistical analysis indicated a rate of withdrawal from stocks during the summer and autumn of 1941 that would have to be checked during thewinter if a crisis was not to come about. In fact, when it became clear that thewar in,Russia could not be brought to an end in 1941, numerous reports began toreach us indicating that drastic steps were being taken to reduce civilian con-sumption and to intensify the development of substitute fuels.3. In our Report published in August 1942 the statistical analysis indicated that, in spite of economies during the winter months, stocks had been furtherdepleted and by the end of April should barely have been sufficient to maintaindistribution stocks and emergency reserves, on which the organisation of oil supplies throughout Axis Europe depends; it was clear that future militarydemands could only be met at the expense of a reduction in essential civilian consumption. In fact, since we reported in August, we have received for thefirst time a number&apos; of reports of oil shortages directly affecting the armed forces.There are, for example, several reports of training being held up, especially inthe Air Force, and Service vehicles in non-operational areas are being converted to an increasing extent for use with substitute fuels. There are also manyreports of increased civilian restrictions and of a new drive to save liquid fuel bythe use of gas generators. There is evidence of the effects of civilian oil shortage,for example no taxis in Mannheim and only three in Cologne; only threeomnibus lines in Vienna; on a journey from Berlin to Dresden not a single car was seen on the road; many complaints of shortage and bad quality of certain grades of lubricating oil and of the extreme shortage of oil in general for industry andtransport.4. The evidence confirms that stocks have been&apos; reduced to such a low level that distribution is becoming difficult. It also suggests that civilian consumption may at last have been reduced so far that the Germans themselvesnow consider that further cuts are more harmful to the war effort than restrictionsof Service consumption.5. There is thus some confirmation of our statistical estimate of the trend in the enemy oil position. We had previously estimated that a stock figure of3 million tons represented the danger level to the enemy. In our last report we estimated that the Axis stocks had, in fact, fallen at 30th April, 1942, to that figure. Whether the estimated stock figure of 3 million tons at 30th April,1942, was accurate or not, the evidence of the measures taken by Germanyindicates that the danger point was in fact reached when we expected it. Thishas the advantage of giving us a fresh datum point and strengthens considerablythe validity of any deductions that may be drawn for future estimates of the trendthe stock position.
II. Statistical Review of the Position from May 1 to October 1, 1942.6. The statistical position during the six months under review is estimated as follows :  Tons.Production  from  the  1st  May,  1942,  to  the31st October, 1942     ......      ......      7,895,000Less consumption by Armed Forces Army    ...      .........      2,165,000Navy     ............      1,230,000Air Force......... 905,000*Todt Organisation     ......        240,000--      4,540,000Balance available for civilian consumption      ...      3,355,000* This includes 312,000 tons for motor transport.7. In our previous report we estimated that non-military requirementsduring the six months May to October 1942 would amount to 4,334,000 tons ifindustrial efficiency was to be maintained. There is thus an apparent deficitbetween supplies and requirements of about 1 million tons.8. Hitherto no allowance has been made for the unknown, but certainly very real, civilian consumption in Occupied Russia. For this additional area an arbitrary minimum of 150,000 tons for the six months under review has been allowed.   This would increase the deficit to 1,150,000 tons.9. We estimate that this deficit of 1,150,000 tons might have been dealt withas follows :  .Tons.Reduction in consumption in Occupied Countries(principally Roumania)        ...      ...      ...        250,000Reduction in consumption in Germany   ...       ... 400,000(This is equivalent to a reduction toabout 20 per cent, below the quantity pre-viously   &quot;considered    necessary    for    fullindustrial efficiency)Withdrawal from stocks   ...      ...      ...      ... 500,0001,150,000. 10. A reduction of stocks by 500,000 tons below the danger level would impose a great strain on the distribution system, which consequently is likely tobe exceptionally sensitive to dislocation.III.-Future Trend of Oil Position.11. During the six months November 1942-May 1943 the supply position may improve as shown below : 1(a) Increased Production: Tons.(1) Synthetic Plants. Aerial reconnaissance of synthetic oil plants indicate that, during the period underreview, output may be increased by      ...      ...      ...    100,000(2) Maikop. -Although exploitation is likely to be delayedby continuance of local fighting and failure to secureports and shipping facilities, Maikop might contributeduring these six months ...      ...      ...      ...      ...    100,000(b) Reduced consumption:(1) Military consumption. A reduction of activity on theEastern Front might achieve a saving compared withthe previous 6 months of...      ...      ...      ...      ... 500,000(2) Producer gas. Further conversions to producer gas are estimated at ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 180,000Total   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...    880,000
December 12, 1942.12. The approximate balance sheet for the next six months, on; the basis ofthe above figures, would therefore be :- Tons,.Production   .........      .........      8,100,000Less Service consumption     ...       ...       ...      4,040,000Leaving balance available for civilian consumption      4,060,000Estimated    minimum    civilian    requirements,including Occupied Russia  (assuming therestrictions amounting to 650,000 tons intro-duced during the previous six months are maintained, and allowing for further con7version to producer gas)       ...       ...       ...      3,654,000Surplus        ...      ...       ....      ...       i..       ..: 406,00013. Assuming, therefore, there is a continuance of the present restrictions,Germany might be able, during the next six months, to replenish her stocks bysome 400,000 tons. She would be unlikely, however, to be in a position to restore the cuts in civilian consumption introduced during the previous six months, or&quot;to undertake the mechanised exploitation of Russia for the 1943 harvest. In themeantime the retention of the Roumanian oilfields, which contribute 33 per cent,of total Axis oil supplies, would remain of vital importance to her.14- The production trend is increasing. By the middle of 1943 additional production at the rate of 1 million tons per year may be expected from synthetic oil plants now in course of erection; this will possibly be increased by a further500,000 tons annual capacity by the end of 1943.15. There are, however, two factors which may alter the position adverselyto the Axis : -(a)&quot; The threat of Allied operations will necessitate the establishment of strategic reserves at new points. This will increase the volume of oilimmobilised in transit and distribution :(&amp;) Active operations in Russia and/or offensive action by.the United nations on other European fronts during the period under review may resultin the Germans being unable to achieve the anticipated economy of500,000 tons in Service consumption.16. These two factors and the consequent need to economise oil may compelGermany either (a) to shorten the length of her front and her lines of communica-tion, or (b) to impose a further drastic reduction in civilian consumption. Thelatter would seriously affect industrial output.17. If, threatened this, winter with a scale of warfare in Russia whichwould force her to consume oil at the same rate as during the winter of 1941/42,Germany decides to accept alternative (a) above, the resultant economies, togetherwith the new synthetic production, would enable her, even without Maikop, to restore civilian supplies in Greater Germany to the minimum efficiency level orto provide fuel for the 1944 Ukrainian harvest, but not both.:18. If the German army is allowed to remain relatively inactive duringthis winter and Germany is thus not compelled to shorten her line in Russia, thereplenishment of reserves, plus the new synthetic oil production available in mid-1943, would enable operations to be renewed against the Caucasus in thelatter half of next year. If Grozny is captured, and both this area and Maikopare redeveloped to attain a substantial proportion of their combined pre-waroutput of about 5.million tons, and if the passage across the Black Sea could be safeguarded,; Germany should then be. in a position to re-establish her stocks, to restore civilian consumption to the minimum efficiency level, and to provide the oil necessary for the 1944 Ukrainian harvest.Signed, on behalf of the Sub-Committee :H. HARTLEY, Chairman.
