Printed for the War Cabinet.  December 1942MOST SECRET.W.P. (42) 605.December 24, 1942.14AftCopy No. 32TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.AXIS OIL POSITION IN EUROPE.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate, for the information of the War Cabinet, a Note by the Chairmanof the Oil Control Board on the Axis Oil Position in Europe.(Signed) C. R. A.Dominions Office, S. W. 1,December 24, 1942.ANNEX.&apos;Note by the Chairman of the Oil Control Board.1. I have to-day drawn the attention of the Chiefs of Staff Committeeto the unsatisfactory state of United Kingdom oil stocks. Although they standat over 5,000,000 tons some difficulties are already occurring in distribution, andI have emphasized the need for increasing imports in order to meet operationaldemands in 1943.2. The Joint Intelligence Committee estimate in their recent report^ thatthe total stocks in Axis Europe now amount to little more than 2,500,000 tons.The United Kingdom has an area of 94,000 square miles served by excellenttransport facilities; Germany has to distribute over 1,500,000 square miles and support a major land war at one extremity of the area.3. It is reported that Diesel ships badly needed in the Baltic are lying-idle, and it is known that the training of the Luftwaffe is, being hampered by shortage of petrol at airfields. In general current intelligence, some of itexceptionally secret, supports the statistical study.4. I have consulted the Chairman of the Petroleum Board, who says that everything goes to show that the Axis oil distribution system is now criticallystretched and, if he was in charge of the German system, he would be in continualterror of complete breakdown as a result of additional strain arising from furtherdisruption of any kind.* W.P.

5. I have been closely associated with these investigations into the enemyoil position since the beginning of the war, and I am impressed with the situation disclosed by this latest review. The Axis oil position now looks very serious certainly more serious than ever before. In about six months&apos; time, however,supplies should increase owing to the completion of more synthetic plants.6. No one can foretell with certainty the future movement of the severalfactors which govern the Axis oil position : nor can the success of attackingoperations be guaranteed. But at the worst it seems clear that Germany will feel keenly the loss even of any small quantities of oil we might be able to destroy.While at the best, substantial destruction of German synthetic production orRoumanian refinery capacity, coinciding with heavy fighting on the Eastern front and defensive operations in the West or South of Europe, should deal a smashingblow at the fighting strength of the Axis.7. Thus changes in the Axis oil position itself give us a great opportunity,perhaps a passing one. Are there any changes in the operational position whichwould enable us to seize this opportunity 1 I suggest that this deserves thorough investigation.G. L.December 21, 1942.
