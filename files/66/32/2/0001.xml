THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;Sf GO YEtfNME^ysrco&quot;&quot;Printed for the War Cabinet.  December 1942.SECRET. /     Copy NoW.P. (42) 572.December 10, 1942./TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Minister of Production on W.P. (42) 570.THE proposed allocation of men to meet the service demands is based onan estimate of the maximum number of fit men that can be spared. The services could only obtain more man-power by drawing more fit men from the -munitions industries.   The effect of such withdrawals upon output would be serious.2. The acutest problem raised by the papers in W.P. (42) 570 is the drastic reduction in the expansion of the R.A.F. This must, as far as possible, be avoided.The reduction, however, is only partly due to the new man-power cut. The R.A.F.had previously been planning on the basis of an M.A.P. programme much larger than could be achieved, having regard to practical limitations on labour intake.3. Forecasts, when revised on a realistic basis, of aircraft production in theUnited Kingdom, together with supplies now promised from United States, will certainly be insufficient to supply the needs of the full expansion programmes;and when account is taken of miscellaneous economies in the use of man-power,the reduced allotment of personnel to the R.A.F. may prove sufficient to man allthe aircraft available from both sources. We should therefore certainly not reopen the United States air agreement at this stage. Nor need we be concerned about our dependence upon Dominion and Allied air crews; in our present man-power position it is right to use them to the utmost.4. We shall have to consider producing more aircraft for the Fleet air arm; America cannot give us enough. In view of other limitations I doubt ifthe allotment of labour to M.A.P. in excess of the proposed ceiling wouldappreciably increase the total output of aircraft in 1943. If this is so, moreaircraft for the F.A.A. can only be obtained at the expense of aircraft for theR.A.F.5. The situation disclosed in these papers reinforces the need for pushingon with the utmost vigour with the change-over from the extravagant Stirlingto the economical Lancaster. Other labour economies can be made by M.A.P. inthe reduction of the bomb,1 machine-gun and other ancillary programmes to thelevel required by a realistic forecast of aircraft output.6. I support the Secretary of State for Air&apos;s proposal that continuousadjustments should be made between the intakes to the R.A.F. and M.A.P.; atthe moment, however, the pressing need is to build up the output of aircraft forR.A.F. and F.A.A. rather than the intake into the R.A.F.7. The First Lord of the Admiralty states that there can be no cut in therequirements for manning the fleet, and that the full cut of 75,000 must fall uponAdmiralty industrial labour. If this statement takes full account of all possible economies in manning and in particular the effect of laying-up the older battle-ships and the probable reduction in T.L.C. manning needs I think that the total[24741]
75,000 Admiralty cut should be reconsidered. I doubt whether the anti-submarine campaign can be effectively prosecuted with the labour force which would remain to the Admiralty.8. The Army cut appears to be unavoidable; it should certainly be possibleto equip and maintain the reduced Army adequately within the labour forceallotted to the Ministry of Supply when account is taken of Canadian productionand the new agreement covering United States supplies. There may be further economies as a result of the investigation proposed by the Prime Minister in w.P. (42) 567.9. My general conclusion is that the proposed lay-out of man-power provides the right pattern to which we must work in 1943.The fixing of the ceilings for the 31st December, 1943, is, however, only ageneral guide, and, in carrying out the plan now laid down, we shall have to facemany problems of major importance.   I will only mention five of these v -Firstly, the estimated net increase in the labour supply of 1,600,000 may prove optimistic, for it assumes the recruitment of 500,000 &quot; unoccupied &quot;women, it aims at taking all fit men from the building industry, and itignores the considerable net wastage of women from industry.Secondly, the timing of the increases in the production programmes or, in the case of the Ministry of Supply, of the net reduction must become-ordinated. For example, if the fall in the Ministry of Supply total is post-poned until after mid-summer, the withdrawal of labour will be too lateeither to help the Armed Forces or to affect M.A.P. production in 1943.Thirdly, it is questionable policy to attempt to maintain production ata high level early next year followed by a sharp fall; for as stated in thepaper on my American negotiations* the first half of the year is going tobe much the tightest period from the point of view of the import of rawmaterials.Fourthly, labour must bp rationed in many forms of production which fall outside the vague definition of &apos;&apos; munitions &apos;&apos; used for fixing theseceilings. Many of them are linked with &apos;&apos; munitions&apos;&apos; and must on no account be robbed to make good deficits in the munitions industries proper;others will be able to release labour because of the reduction in requirements for non-operational equipment. Again, some of the workers in the&apos;&apos; munitions &apos;&apos; industries are working for other than Supply Departments.Finally, much of the Ministry of Supply&apos;s &quot;munitions&quot; labour is employed on work for the Navy and the R.A.F. (e.g., small-arms ammunition)and on production of industrial equipment for common user (e.g., machine tools); part of M.A.P.&apos;s output is for the F.A.A. We shall have to decide how Departments should treat such requirements when cutting down their&apos;     programmes.For reasons such as these, the working of the present plan must be closelywatched and compared with the progress of production, so that the readjustmentsthat will become necessary may be promptly made.O. L.Ministry of Production, S.W. 1,December 10, 1942.* W.P. (42) 568.
