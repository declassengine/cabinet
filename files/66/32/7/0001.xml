Treasury.(Secretary)We have been asked to report v/hether a scheme could be devised forpermitting and*regulating the posthumous award of deoorations for gallantry, otherthan those already awarded posthumously.^  We consider that, subject to the qualifications mentioned below, ascheme could be devised to provide for the posthumous award of the D.S. 0., M. C.,D.F.C., D.C.M., C.G.M. , D.S.M. , M.M. , D.F.M. , G.M, , I.D.S.M., B.G.M., and ofthe R.R.G., A.R.R.C., B.E.M., when granted for gallantry rather than good service.The
The scheme would necessarily &quot;be confined to those killed after some current date.     Recommendations would &quot;be permissible only within twelvemonths of the date of death.     Military posthumous awards would &quot;be reckonedequally with those to the living, for allocation from operational quotas on thepresent scale.     It would probably &quot;be found to be convenient to limit posthumousawards to 2fo or perhaps 5fa of the total awards from any theatre for a particular&quot;Service in each six monthly period.iThe administrative difficulties involved in this scheme, which are serious if not prohibitive, centre round (a) the problem of selection and (-!-.-(b) inevitable disparities between different cases.Selection under such a scheme would, in our view, frequently be basedon such slight knowledge of the circumstances that it would amount to little morethan guesswork.     At &quot;present next-of-kin know that death, not human judgment,prevents an award.     This consolation will no longer remain to them.The dead are not appointed to Orders (though a widow may be grantedprecedence as though her husband had been appointed to an Order) and the scheme would not extend to the B. 3. 0. , O.B.E. , or M.B.E.     The necessary exclusion ofthe Orders would involve serious disparities, very noticeable, for instance,in the case of the D.S.0o     While the scheme would permit of posthumous awards of, for instance, the D. S.C. , or M,C. to junior officers, there would be no corresponding posthumous award at all for an officer of the rank of Captain R.N. ,or Lieutenant Colonel.As the scheme would necessarily be confined to those who. lose their lives after some current date there is no means of avoiding the unfairness tothose who have already given their lives in this way or the dissatisfaction whichwould thus be created amongst the next-of-kin.     When the question of posthumousawards was examined in 1937 and 1938, although some differences were expressedbefore conclusions were reached, it v/as clear that the introduction of a change of system at a time when a major war had been waged for some considerable period would be precluded &quot;by the consideration just named.We regret that we can suggest no scheme such as might obviate theseserious difficulties, which we fear would be sufficient to bring an alteredsystem, if alteration were decided upon, quickly into disrepute-We desire to draw attention to the fact that death after recommendationdoes not, under the system already in force, invalidate an award, provided the candidate was alive when the first definite recorded recommendation was made..
