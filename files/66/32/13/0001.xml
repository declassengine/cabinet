THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942. - -MOST SECRET. Copy No*W.P. (42) 583.December 15, 1942.TO BE KEPT  UNDER  LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.UNITED KINGDOM-INVASION IN 1943.Note by the Minister of Defence.I AM in full accord with the conclusions of the Chiefs of the Staff and i recommend that they should be endorsed by my colleagues in the War Cabinet.2. It is, of course, understood that our immunity from invasion even in 1943depends upon the maintenance of a good army strong enough to make it uselessfor the enemy to come except in numbers large enough to furnish effective targets,on sea and in the invasion ports, for our Navy and Air Force.3. Whereas in the summer of 1940 we could only bomb the invasion portsby night, our fighter cover has now become strong enough to protect British and american bombers operative by day. Thus those invasion ports from Dunkirk toDieppe inclusive which were the greatest danger to us and were nearest to Kentand Sussex, and thus to London, are now almost certainly denied to the enemy, whois thus forced to cross broader waters with additional weather risks and offeringfurther opportunities to the Navy. Should any offensive operations undertaken by us in 1943 bring about a further relative weakening of the enemy&apos;s Air Force,the foregoing considerations would be enhanced.4. While I am entirely in favour of a definite diminution in the scale ofdefence for airfields and vulnerable points against airborne descents, the possi-bility of vicious raids cannot be excluded. It would be well if the Chiefs of theStaff would draw up a statement of the actual measures and reductions it isproposed to enforce, as a consequence of their conclusions, at the above points andalso along the coasts.* W.P. (42) 582.[24755]
5. The conversion of the army to the offensive phase is urgent and should be pressed forward with the utmost vigour and contrivance. It is certainly not sufficient that only 9 divisions should be available for offensive action by the1st July, and that 15 cannot be obtained before the 1st October. A special studyshould be made to bring the October figure forward to July.6. While it is necessary that these conclusions should become known to a wide circle of officers, stringent instructions should be issued that they are to bekept absolutely secret. No officer is to use in public any language compatible with the idea that all danger of invasion is gone, and the Minister of information should endeavour to dissuade the Press from making any statements of this character, which can only have a discouraging effect upon the large numbers oftroops and Civil Defence personnel involved in Home Defence, on whose untiring-vigilance and efficiency our safety from month to month depends.w. s. c.December 15, 1942.
