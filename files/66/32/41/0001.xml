THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 611,December 30, 1942.Copy No.  / 1TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.VISIT OF THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION TO AMERICA.I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet and Defence Committeethe annexed letter which I am sending to President Roosevelt in reply to his letter of the 30th November circulated in W.P. (42) 563. The facts in this letterhave been agreed by the Ministers principally concerned.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1.The Prime Minister to the President.My dear Mr. President,1. THE letter which Oliver Lyttelton brought and the associated agreementsabout Air and Ground force equipment are very welcome. I am deeply grateful.These Washington discussions and. the conclusions reached show that ourdepartments and yours are developing a closer understanding of each other&apos;sproblems and getting nearer to a common view of the war. This is essential tosuccess.2. The Agreements arranged by Lyttelton, together with the assurances of your letter, give me a basis on which to allocate our reserves of man-power infull confidence that our British effort will be effectively balanced and rightlyapplied.   We have now taken our decisions.   I will not burden you with details.[24795]
in broad terms we calculate that between midsummer 1942 and December 1943we may be able to draft into the Services and draw into munition production some,600,000 extra men and women. Considering the degree of mobilisation already achieved, in the past three years this is a large figure, and to reach it will mean a further straitening of living conditions and will call upon all the nation&apos;slatent resources. But it is less by 1,100,000 than is asked for by the Servicesand those responsible for our munition production whose combined requirementstotal 2,700,000. We have therefore had to ration out reserves of man-powerand confine the programmes to essentials without allowing any margins for insurance or contingencies.3. The following is what we have decided. First, we must give the Navy all they need for the anti-U-boat war up to the limit of our shipbuilding capacity and the resources which you can assign to us. The Admiralty will get the men for manning the ships but they must reduce their industrial requirements by labour economies in the shipyards and workshops, even though this meansslowing down somewhat the building of big ships. Escort vessels will have thehighest priority in the Navy&apos;s programme, and I am obliged to you for the allocations made to us from the pool.4. Secondly, we shall strain every nerve to prevent labour shortage fromchecking the expansion of our aircraft industry. Our policy, subject to the limitations of training, technical problems, the availability of management andthe supply of material and machines, will be to move labour into the factories as fast as it can be absorbed. The R.A.F., which has been taking in recruits on alarge scale, will be able to use effectively all the aircraft which we can make or which you will send us under the new agreement or more. But, like other services, it will have to be economical in its use of man-power and even reducesome of its defensive services, such as the balloon barrage and air field guards.5. There are two things concerning the aircraft programme about which Iam greatly concerned : one is the Fleet Air Arm and the other is transport aircraft. I have the impression that neither of our countries is devoting enough of its aircraft production to either of these two objects. We must be certainthat we have enough Fleet Air Arm type aircraft to match the carrier programmes in the two countries, and, as things are, it looks as if we might fall behind.Again, the experiences of both the Egyptian and North African campaignsemphasise the great value of transport aircraft, and I am personally much impressed with the Russian argument with which they back their demands forfurther transport aircraft. It may be that their power to start a successfuloffensive in 1943 will depend upon increasing our ability to supply them with transport aircraft to supplement their rather rudimentary communications.As you know, we ourselves are woefully short of transport aircraft, but we areproviding them with 100 Albemarles for conversion for this purpose. I believethere are proposals in the United States for building wooden aircraft, and I feelthat, if you could personally stimulate this production, it might prove a decisionof the highest strategic importance.
6. Third, we have had to limit the Army&apos;s man-power intake considerably,and we are having to curtail our plans for producing Army equipment. TheArmy will take its cut where it hurts least; we can now run more risk in thinningout the home defences, and generally in combing the Army&apos;s tail, in order tosharpen its teeth. Here and there, as in the Middle East, we shall have to maketwo divisions into one by compression. But at home the main decision is to convertthe Home Army to an offensive basis with a possible increase in its striking power.We shall be able to reduce the numbers in the factories making ground equipment,partly because the personnel is becoming more efficient and output per head isrising, partly because the initial equipment of the Army is in many items nearlycomplete and we are reaching the point where we can maintain it on a reducedoutput. We have been fortified in taking the decision to reduce the labour at thedisposal of the Ministry of Supply by the agreements which Oliver Lytteltonbrought back covering tanks and other Army supplies. In the circumstances, weshall rely heavily upon your medium tanks; I agree with your view that some increase in your programme would be wise.7. Lastly shipping. Here again we are fortified by your assurance thatour 27-mi&apos;million-ton import programme will be met, as well as our other essential needs. This is an undertaking of the highest importance to these islands. you may rest assured that we shall do our utmost to limit the demands of the Britishimport programme upon the common pool of shipping. We are now running down our stocks, and we shall make what economies we can. But these devicesonly give us a little relief for a little while. You have warned me that the early months of 1943 will be difficult. This I fully understand. But I must tell youfrankly that the prospect in the next few months is going to be more acute than we expected when the figures were prepared which Lyttelton took to Washington.American shipbuilding has turned your own net losses of the spring into a surplus.British and Allied net losses are, however, very serious indeed. In November, forexample admittedly a bad month losses from all causes of American-controlled and United Nations&apos; tonnage other than our own were 260,000 d.w. tons, against which, excluding the Todd ships for us, you built 850,000 tons d.w., giving a netgain of 590,000 tons. Losses of British-controlled tonnage, on the other hand, were850,000 tons d.w. (100,000 due to Torch), against which new construction ofBritish and Canadian yards, plus the Todd contracts, gave us 250,000 tons,leaving us a net loss of 600,000 tons. With this position before us you will under-stand how vital it is that the reinforcement of our depleted shipping resources should not be deferred. The situation which we now foresee will only give usimports over the five months November to March at the rate of 17 million tonsa year. This is indeed a grim prospect, and one which means for us dangerous and difficult decisions between military operations, food and raw materials.8.   The suggested average supplement figure of 300,000 tons of dry-cargocarrying capacity each month will only be enough if certain conditions are fulfilled.   First and foremost, we must be able to load a sufficient proportion of, our total import on the North Atlantic seaboard or at other near or convenientI sources of supply.   Our joint machinery will examine this and other technical
aspects, but in thanking you for the directions which you have given, I mustsound the alarm of mortal urgency. I am relieved by knowing that you will keepthis whole business constantly under your own eye and that no further importantdiversion of tonnage to military purposes will be made without your personaldirection after I have had my say.9. I was also reassured by your resolve to raise the shipbuilding programme to 20,000,000 dead-weight tons, if it should prove feasible; and, as we live and fightupon our shipping, I hope you will be able to give me some good news about theresult of this enquiry.  Indeed, any news of progress on this would be helpful.10. In conclusion, Mr. President, let me emphasize the fact that our wholeman-power lay-out is based upon striking the strongest blows we can in 1943.We will run the utmost risk for this; but unless our shipping resources are, infact, repaired as you so kindly propose, I shall be forced immediately to reducethe British war effort in oversea theatres even though this involves prolongation of the war and leaves you a greater portion of the burden we are eager to share.Believe me,Always your most sincere friend,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.December 30, 1942.
