SECRET. Copy -No.1W.P. (42) 593.December 28, 1942.3 war CABINET,INDIA.DISCUSSION.IN THE GOVERNOR-GENERAUS EXECUTIVECOUNCIL ON THE INDIAN constitutional position.Memorandum by thei Secretary of State for India.   - .:DURING August last the Viceroy, having heard that certain of the Membersof his Council were anxious to see further changes in the constitutional positionin India, and were endeavouring to gain the support of all Members of theCouncil for certain proposals to this end, decided to invite a general discussionof these matters in the Council itself. At a series of special meetings the various members gave their views, though the Viceroy was careful to make it clear thatthese matters were outside the legal authority of the Council. :Before very long I expect to bring before the War Cabinet the questionwhether further Indianisation of the Viceroy&apos;s Council is desirable, in connectionwith the appointment of a successor to Sir Reginald Maxwell, the Home Member,who is due to retire in April. The views expressed in the recent discussion byMembers of the Executive Council are relevant to the decision which will then,have to be taken, and I therefore circulate a precis of them for the informationof the War Cabinet.L. S. A.India Office,December 28, 1942.Precis of Discussion in the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council.The Viceroy explained at the outset that the discussion was necessarilyon an informal basis and. without prejudice to existing constitutional arrange-ments, and then examined briefly and objectively the three directions in which he understood an advance to be desired i(a) The complete Indianisation of his Council;(b) The elimination or reduction of the powers of control and interference ofthe Secretary of State; and(c) Mitigation of the purely official nature Of the administration in theSection 93 Provinces.  The general discussion was then opened.Sir Reginald Maxwell (Home Member) pointed out the clanger of taking shortcuts, in attempts to^ appease Congress. The Government of India could not besevered from Parliamentary control unless it could derive power from some newsovereign authority. A transfer of power in present circumstances would be unnecessary and rash, and he would be strongly opposed to any initiative in that direction being taken by the present Government. In the S. 93 Provinces he sawdifficulties in minority ministries or in Executive Councils, but would be ready toagree to non-official advisers.Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar (Member without Portfolio), agreed that for the duration of the war it was essential that the Secretary of State should be the[24812]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.

2final authority. On that postulate one must assume that no suggestion could bemade that could satisfy Congress, or, indeed, the Moslem League, but neverthelesscertain changes were desirable. He thought that S. 93 Provinces were losingconfidence in the Governors and their advisers, who were cut off from publicopinion, with the result that a difficult and dangerous position was arising. Hewould prefer to meet it by introducing Executive Councils composed ofnon-officials, even though that meant a reversion to the system operating1909-20, under the Morley-Minto reforms. In the Centre, he felt that Govern-ment should bid more fully for the support of moderate opinions. There was growing criticism that, despite the expansion of the Council, Indian non-officials had failed to secure really substantial control. In his view, it was very desirableto introduce at once what was an inevitable change and give every Departmentto a non-official Indian member.Sir Hormusji Mody (Member for Supply) agreed with Sir P. Mudaliar. TheCouncil&apos;s position had been destroyed by the Cripps Mission, and it had beenignored in the constitutional discussions of last March and April. CompleteIndianisation was the very least that was now expected. If nothing could now bedone with Congress and the League, at least let Government try to placate the others. As for the S. 93 Provinces, the present system was archaic, autocratic andintolerable; the Provinces were subject to no control or supervision. He wouldlike non-official Executive Councils, or else non-official advisers. As regards theSecretary of State&apos;s control, the direction of affairs should pass by convention orotherwise from the Secretary of State to the Government of India.Sir Sultan Ahmed (Law Member) agreed with Sir P. Mudaliar&apos;s views.External Affairs, as well as Home and Finance, should be transferred to an indian Member. Government in the S. 93 Provinces was a political scandal; hewould like to see non-official Executive Councils introduced, or, failing them,non-official advisers with the powers of an irremovable executive.Mr. Aney (Member for Indians Overseas) thought that Congress might-reconsider&apos;their position if a real popular Government with real power were setup. The existence of the Secretary of State&apos;s powers was humiliating; could theynot be transferred to the Viceroy ? He would rather have India governed by anautocratic Viceroy than a distant and intangible Secretary of State. He favouredcomplete Indianisation of the Executive, and would even have an Indiannon-official member by whose advice the Governor-General would be guided in thediscretionary field. In the S. 93 Provinces he preferred minority ministries, with provision to rule out.votes of confidence being moved by persons who were notprepared to take office.Mr. Sarker (Commerce Member) agreed with Sir P. Mudaliar. CompleteIndianisation of the Council was the very minimum. The Congress leaders hadbeen put in jail by Indians; Indians alone really understood how to handle thesematters. As regards the Secretary of State&apos;s control, he saw difficulty in thepropositions put forward : if the Secretary of State were replaced by the Viceroythe members of Council would be advisers to the Viceroy, and not his colleagues.He saw that the Council must be responsible to someone acting on behalf ofParliament.  In the S. 93 Provinces he favoured non-official advisers.Sir Firoz Khan Noon (Defence Member) agreed in favouring non-official advisers in the S. 93 Provinces, but thought the possibilities of alternativeministries in certain Provinces (e.g., Bombay) had not been fully explored. as for the Centre, he was opposed to further change without the assent of the two major communities or adequate safeguards. Muslim India was already aggrievedat having only three seats in a Council of fifteen. He was entirely opposed, fromthe minority point of view, to the removal of the Secretary of State&apos;s authority.Sir Edward Benthall (Member for War Transport) saw no need foruniformity in the Provinces. As for the Centre, the essential- thing was a strongGovernment for the prosecution of the war and for the transition period, to actas an anchor in the coming period of great uncertainty. A strong government must be based on a final authority, which must be the Secretary of State and parliament; there was no alternative, since there, was no legislature to which theGovernment of India could be responsible without a change of the Act. CompleteIndianisation would not really strengthen the Council and the effect would be verytemporary and limited. The disappearance of the official members would mean the loss of experienced colleagues at a critical time.. The wise course now was tobuild up the status and the prestige of Council for the war and the transitional
period. He, thought something could be done to strengthen the hands of theGovernor-General in Council without any change in the Act; could the Secretaryof State not say, consistently with his responsibility to Parliament, that he wouldordinarily be guided by the Governor-General in Council?Sir Mohammad Usman (Member for Posts and Air) preferred in theProvinces to add non-official to official advisers. As for the Centre, completeIndianisation would give no greater satisfaction than had. the previousexpansions. Any change in the Centre would be strongly resented by the moslem league, and the effect on the police would be bad; it was particularly important not to antagonise Mr. Jinnah at a time when the Moslem League were, in fact,unofficially co-operating in the war effort. He was clear that consideration of constitutional questions must be left till after the war and no change of any sortmade at present.Dr.Ambedkar (Member for Labour) was opposed to any change unless it wasin accordance with the Declaration of August 1940 (providing for consultationwith important minorities). Subject to that, he was in favour of change, sincewhat was needed was a strong Government, i.e., one with public opinion behind it. In the Provinces, ministerial government was best, even if merely a minorityministry. An Executive Council would be better than advisers. As for theCentre, Indianisation by itself would not pLacate Congress and might merelyirritate them; and were non-Congress elements worth placating? BeforeIndianisation took place the communal composition of the Council must besettled, and that by Indians themselves. Congress had shirked this problem; theyhad not the will to solve it. His suggestion was to take the Cripps proposals asa basis and try for a national Government composed of Congress, the moslem league, Depressed Classes, Sikhs and Christians. The Indian members of council ought to sit down and prepare a &quot;scheme for communal representation,.Though he preferred an autocratic Viceroy to a distant Secretary of State, hewould not press for interference with the Secretary of State&apos;s powers.Sir Jwala Prasad Srivastava (Member for Civil Defence) said that constitu-tional change was necessary because of the universal desire for some major political advance. We might have stayed where we were had His Majesty&apos;sGovernment held to the line that no constitutional change was feasible during thewar. The whole trouble arose from the Cripps offer. Why should we refuse to implement it because the two major parties would not co-operate? Congress andthe League never had accepted anything offered by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand never would; neither would face the unpopularity of conducting governmentin war time. Public opinion would be satisfied, especially after subsidence of thepresent bitterness, with the.immediate introduction of the changes proposed bySir R,. Mudaliar. But it must be left to the Governor-General to work out the communal proportions. As regards the S. 93 Provinces, he favoured executive councils. .Sir Jogendra Singh (Member for Education, Health and Lands) was wearyof hearing of Moslem League and Congress, the Depressed Classes and the Sikhs.We must keep faith with the army and the fighting men. The right course wouldbe for the Secretary of State to transfer all power to the present Government ofIndia and the Governor-General; he was in favour thereupon of implementing thefederal sections of the 1935 Act, less those clauses repugnant to self-government.As for the Provinces, he preferred Executive Councils.The Commander-in-Chief doubted the value of further changes on indian opinion as affecting the conduct of the war; he was not in favour of any change.In the Provinces, uniformity was not essential; practically the order of prefer-ence might be non-official advisers, Executive Councils, ministerial governments,the reverse of the ideal order of desirability.Sir Jeremy Raisman (Finance Member) wished to get on with the job of winning the war; further changes in the Council would have an unsettling effect.Failing a thorough-going political settlement the present Government must remain within the terms of the Act and responsible to Parliament. In thecircumstances what advantage was there in pretending to be a national govern-ment ? The transfer of the powers of the Secretary of State would solve noproblems. As for the Provinces, he would favour a combination of official and non-official advisers. Executive Councils would be a retrograde step and the -arguments against minority ministries were very strong.
The Viceroy summed up the discussion and made the following points.He was proud of the Council as it stands; it is the strongest Governmentthat India has had.The references to minorities showed that no one imagined that the balanceof communal or minority representation in a provisional wartime Governmentwas not going to affect the extent of representation accorded to the communities in the permanent post-war settlement. But this is the most vital and con-controversial of all the difficult problems that the constitution-making body willhave to solve. It ought not, and cannot, be settled while hostilities continue,and the attempt to solve it now would only exacerbate communal difficulties andprejudice the post-war settlement.One consequence of the Cripps . Mission was to reduce the stature of theCouncil; but the hurt was largely temporary. The prestige of the Council inIndia and abroad stands high.The basic principle that until the Indian executive can draw its iltimate authority from an Indian Parliament it must derive its ultimate authority fromthe British Parliament, is not, and cannot be, successfully challenged.The extent of the Secretary of State&apos;s alleged interference with the Govern -ment of India is greatly misrepresented.The Indianisation of the Home and Finance portfolios would not have the slightest effect on Congress or the Moslem League; and it would soon be discounted and lead to an attack on the Governor-General&apos;s veto. It would raise,too, the communal issue, particularly over the appointment of the Home Member.Complete Indianisation would necessitate an amendment of the Act if it means the appointment of only non-official Indians, and Parliament would be verycritical of the proposal.There are special objections, partly arising out of the communal issue, tothe appointment of a Member for External Affairs.As for the S.93 Provinces, it is improbable that either minority ministriesor Council government would be easy, comfortable, or in the long run beneficial;and Parliament would be reluctant to.sanction the retrograde step of introducingExecutive Council government. S.93 administration is provisional and has the saving grace that everyone is anxious to end it. The most practical expedientwas probably that of non^official advisers; and the authorities primarily con-cerned in this respect were the Governors themselves:  ; - iAt the end of the discussion Sir Hormusji Mody asked that the Secretaryof State might be told.that quite half the Council had been in favour of&apos; Indianisation and elimination of the official element in the Council; and alsothat they felt strongly that neither expansion had resulted in the transfer ofsome of the most important portfolios. The Viceroy undertook to communicate the views of his colleagues to the Secretary of State. &apos; &apos;&apos; ,
