this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December1942.TO BE KESECRET.     .-1 &quot; It li vzqumiiW.P. (42) 601. ;-5 -December 22, 1942.WAR CABINET.AMERICAN INFLUENCE IN WEST AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.AT the request of the Prime Minister, I circulate the attached copies ofrecent correspondence with the Resident Minister about American influence in west Africa.   In this correspondence Lord Swinton makes two main points : (1) He is perturbed at the apparent subordination of British. interests to american control in French West Africa, a region which we hopedduring the war to make a British sphere of influence.(2) He is anxious about the effects on the African population of the british west African Colonies. He feels that they may get the impression that Americans are in a position of dominance not only in FrenchWest Africa but also in our own territories.2. On the first point His Majesty&apos;s Government have already made efforts to uphold the British point of view. Despite the difficulties of the situationwe have, to some extent, been successful in asserting the interests of HisMajesty&apos;s Government both in the strategic and economic fields. I need hardlyremind my colleagues how great those interests are. The vast territories ofFrench West Africa, over 1,800,000 square miles in extent, sprawl across vitalsea and air routes and among their varied tropical products are commodities suchas oilseeds and rubber which are most valuable to the Allies.3. In the strategic field, the Americans appear to accept the position that-the Eastern Atlantic should be regarded as within the British sphere of strategicresponsibility and there seem to be reasonable grounds to hope that satisfactory arrangements will be reached with regard to the use of French West Africanports, airfields, &amp;c, by British forces as well as American. Nevertheless, thesuccess of these arrangements must be largely dependent upon the extent towhich a good understanding can be established between the local British,American and French authorities.4. In the economic sphere it is obvious that French West Africa cannot beregarded as the exclusive preserve of either the United States or the UnitedKingdom, and there must plainly be some give and take. But when negotiations were opened between General Eisenhower and Admiral Darlan and M. Boisson,there was a serious danger that the United States would be committed to handlingFrench West African economic affairs from Algiers, and also that French WestAfrica would permanently become an American sphere of influence, despite thefact that in all material respects it should be grouped with the other West andEquatorial African territories and dealt with in the same way, i.e.,- primarily byHis Majesty&apos;s Government.5. We took what action was possible to avert the danger and the presentposition is that the Combined Raw Materials Board has recommended that HisMajesty&apos;s Government shall be responsible for the purchase of kapok and rubber,and the United States for sisal. Much more important, the Combined food board has recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government shall similarly beresponsible for buying oilseeds i.e., groundnuts and palm kernels. Moreover,[24797]     &apos; ^ copy No.   53be taken to       -----
all the United States authorities concerned seem to be agreed that it is logicaland right that the general shipping arrangements for French West Africa shallbe dealt with by the same machinery as that which deals with the British west african Colonies, Fighting French Africa, and the Belgian Congo, i.e., the west african Supplies Committee of the Ministry of War Transport on which theHarriman Mission is represented. It is understood that Admiral Glassford*is aware of all this. &apos;6. So far, so good; but it is unwise to place complete reliance on thepermanence of such decisions, at any rate until they have begun to be translated into practice, and it is possible that at any time some United States department or Agency, hitherto silent, may come forward with some new proposals and proceed to act on them. It is known that the Board of Economic Warfare, for one,have had it in mind to operate in French West Africa.7. In order to enable us to clinch matters as soon as possible, a BritishEconomic Mission has been constituted, which will leave for West Africa in thenext few days. Once in Dakar, it is hoped that the Mission will be able at a very early stage to take some definite action, e.g., to effect one or two shipments ofgroundnuts. The Mission will, of course, work closely with the United states authorities, and also keep in constant touch with Lord Swinton.8. On the economic side, it may therefore be said that the omens arepropitious for prompt action, and this will be taken. It is vital that the economic affairs of French West Africa should be primarily the responsibility of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, and, should difficulties arise, I trust that the WarCabinet will be prepared to give firm support to this view.9. Now I turn to British West Africa. Lord Swinton feels that the african people in our Colonies are affected by the fact that the British areplaying second fiddle to the Americans in negotiations with the neighbouringFrench territories. This impression on the African mind is reinforced by thehigh-handed behaviour of irresponsible Americans in the British West african colonies. The result, as Lord Swinton says, is a crop of rumours that the Britishare quitting West Africa and the Americans taking their place.10. I do not wish to overrate the significance of the wild talk of Americansreported by Lord Swinton, especially as he tells us that the local american military Commander, General Fitzgerald, has been most anxious to suppress theirresponsible activities of his countrymen, but it does seem to me that Americanbusiness interests may aim at establishing a permanent position of economicpredominance in British West Africa. Unmistakable interest in post-wardevelopment in these territories has already been shown by Pan-american airways and the Socony Vacuum Company. I feel it is possible that we mightlater be invited to acquiesce in a broad scheme of economic co-operation with america as very much the senior partner, while His Majesty&apos;s Government are left with the task of grappling with increasingly complex politicalresponsibilities. This situation would seriously undermine British authority and seriously impede our administrative task in those countries.11. Whatever may be thought of this possibility, I consider it very important to do whatever can be done to counteract the deplorable impression which is beingmade on the minds of British West Africans by the behaviour of Americans andto allay the suspicion and uneasiness created by the rumours which have becomecurrent.12. Action to assert, as against America, the general British interest in west Africa is a matter for the Foreign Secretary. But, as regards the internal. difficulties in our own Colonies, Lord Swinton has expressed the strong opinionthat the position would be eased if an American representative of the rightkind were posted to Accra to co-ordinate all American interests and activities in West Africa. According to my latest information this appointment has beenaccepted in principle and it is now only a question of finding the right man.We are expecting further information from Washington as to the latter pointin the very near future. I agree with Lord Swinton and I recommend that lord Halifax should be asked to press for this appointment to be made as soonas possible.13. I recommend further that Lord Halifax should be given the factscontained in Lord Swinton&apos;s telegram No. 574 of the 18th December as back-* Head of the United States Service Mission now in Dakar.
ground to assist him in his negotiations and that he should be asked to advisewhether the concrete suggestions made in paragraph 5 of that telegram shouldbe more suitably taken up by him with the State Department or settled on the spot with Lord Swinton once the American representative has been appointed.The three suggestions to which I refer are the following :-(a) If United States Office of War Information outposts have to be main-tained in British Colonies, they should not engage in any internalpropaganda except at the request of the Colonial Governments, andon external propaganda should work in association with, and underthe direstion of British propaganda authorities.(b) In order to avoid misunderstanding and false rumours it would bedesirable that United States officers should confine their enquiriesto matters relevant to their military duties.(c) American troops coming to West Africa should have a pamphlet onbehaviour in an Allied country, like that which they have in Englandand our airmen have in United States.0.

. ANNEX I.Telegram from Resident Minister to Secretary of State for the Colonies. (Received December 13.)(No. 547.   Most Secret.) Achimota, December 13, 1942.MY telegram No. 546.1. I am perturbed, as I am sure my colleagues at home are, at the apparentsubordination of British interests to predominating American control in a regionwhich we hope to make a British sphere of influence, but, above all, by enhancingstatus and permanence which trend of affairs is giving to Darlan and Boisson.2. Moreover, I am afraid there will be local reactions, of which I ought to warn you. There is already evidence of local unrestricted resentment at thisapparent subordination of British interests to American control. SomeAmericans have not been slow to boast of their predominance. This has a bad effect on relations between British and American personnel (outside the senior officers and officials). These relations have not been too easy, but Governors,Commanders and I have been doing our best to improve them.3. The effect on Africans may be more serious and more lasting. There havebeen a number of foolish rumours as to America supplanting Britain in Africa.These, coinciding with American criticism of British Imperialism and colonial administration, will be fortified by pre-eminent role now being assumed by Americain negotiating with our neighbours. All this will have a disquieting effect onAfricans, which will not be lessened by poor impression made on African mind bythe attitude and behaviour of many irresponsible Americans.   -4.   Please pass copy to Foreign Office.(Repeated to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief by savingram No. 112.)ANNEX II.Telegram from Secretary of State for the Colonies to Resident Minister.(Sent December 16, 1942.)(No. 535.   Most Secret.)YOUR telegram No. .547.1. General problem is, of course, under continuous consideration here.Prime Minister wishes the points regarding local West African reactions to bediscussed by Cabinet; and I should be grateful if, to facilitate Cabinet considera-tion, you could let us have further information as matter of urgency on two points : (i) Is it possible for you to amplify with concrete detail your remarks inyour paragraph 3 about effect on African opinion of activities ofAmericans in our West African Colonies ?(ii) Have you any suggestions which you wish to put forward as to action by-  -       His Majesty&apos;s Government vis-a-vis American Government either onthe wider or more local aspects of the situation ?2. I should also be grateful if you would request the four West AfricanGovernors to telegraph to me as early as possible their views on the situationwhich is developing. But I should appreciate it if you would not delay youranswer to the above until the views of the Governors have been obtained.ANNEX III.Telegram from Resident Minister to Secretary of State for theColonies. (Received December 18.)(No. 574.   Most Secret.) Achimota, December 18, 1942.YOUR telegram No. 535.1. Apprehensions expressed in paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 547 are based on combination of following factors : -United States official activities.Conduct of individual Americans.Anti-Imperialist criticism in American speeches and writings.-Local rumours fortified by A, B and C.A.B.C-D.
2.   Examples of above factors are : A. Official activities : (i) Representative of United States Office of War Information in Accra.has stated that he has instructions, inter alia to explain the Americanpoint of view to local population, and explains his task under this head as &quot; selling &quot; two ideas :-  - . !(a) The American part in the war; and ,.(b) The &quot;Four Freedoms &quot; and their interpretation (my telegrams nos. 497 and 499 refer).(ii) Two American Army officers, describing themselves as military observersfor the United States Government, have recently arrived here with aletter from Major-General in Charge of American intelligence service, dated 24th July, stating that the encyclopaedic information regarding the Gambia, Gold Coast and Nigeria available to him was..- very out of date, and asking that local representative should obtaindetailed information under the following heads : (1) Communications, roads and railways.(2) Ports and harbours.(3) Telegraph, telephones and wireless.(4) Industries and manufactures.(5) Availability of labour and adaptability for work away from home.(6) Police system.(7) Power plants. -(iii) The fact that United States officers are conducting all negotiations withBoisson to the apparent exclusion of the British.    I, of course,appreciate the position, but it has its effect.B. Talk and behaviour of irresponsible Americans.   This harder to check,but the following are definite examples :: -(1) In October three Americans, with two Achimota students, visitedSir Ofori Atta. Americans asked him if he would prefer that theGold Coast should come under American rule. Atta replied thatBritish Government Chief could hardly agree to such a suggestion.Tone of their conversation was that the Chiefs and people of theGold Coast would be very well off under American rule.(2) Pan-American personnel using.local ferry refused to pay toll fees andthreatened toll-keeper with revolver.(3) Cases have been reported of Americans gate-crashing Government rest-houses when District Commissioner in residence.(4) An American deliberately switched off Prime Ministers broadcast in public room of Accra hotel, where number of people were assembled.(5) Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Sudan, has just reported that, whenvisiting American Army Headquarters here on official business andwith letter from ferry group at Khartum, he was told by Americanofficer that Americans were not here to help the British.These are activities by irresponsible Americans, and General Fitzgerald hasbeen most anxious to suppress them. But when such incidents happen they have their effect on the native population,D. Following rumours have been reported as current during this year :&apos;- (1) When the Governor of the Gold Coast went as Acting Governor of Nigeriait was rumoured that the Americans were taking over the Gold Coast.(2) Provincial Council Chiefs of the Eastern Province asked if it was truethat Gold Coast was to be leased to the Americans for 99 years.(3) British Governor of the Gold Coast given two years to clear out beforethe Americans took over.(4) Americans stay at Government House because they are about to take .control.(5) Americans to take over Northern Territories and Ashanti, leaving theColony to the -British.3.   By the last sentence of paragraph 3 of my telegram No.. 547 I mean this Immediate result of behaviour like abuse of natives and exhibitionism withnative prostitutes is to make the Africans dislike the Americans and compare themunfavourably with the British. But the ultimate result is to foment colour feelingand increase our racial problems.
4. In these matters Gold Coast most in evidence because many moreAmericans stationed here than in other territories. Governor of the Gold Coastconcurs in this telegram. Am asking the other Governors to telegraph theirimpressions direct. Hope to fly Lagos Saturday or Sunday and discuss withthe Governor.5.   I have three definite suggestions : (a) If United States Q.W.I. outposts have to be maintained in british colonies, they should not engage in any internal propaganda except at the request of the Colonial Governments, and on external propa-ganda should work in association with, and under the direction of,British propaganda authorities (paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of my telegramNo. 499. refer).(&amp;) In order to avoid misunderstanding and false rumours it would, bedesirable that United States officers should confine their enquiries to matters relevant to their military duties,(c) Would it be possible for American troops coming to West Africa to havea pamphlet on behaviour in an allied country, like they have been inEngland and our airmen have in United States.6. On wider aspects I cannot add anything to action His Majesty&apos;sGovernment already taking to try and bring French West Africa into the west african orbit and under British sphere of influence. I feel strongly difficult position will be made easier if the right American representatives (e.g., Hibberd)is posted here.
