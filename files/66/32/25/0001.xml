NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.I. A convoy of two ships from the Eastern Mediterranean has arrivedat Malta.Human torpedoes have inflicted some casualties on shipping in - Algiersharbour.One of our destroyers has been sunk and a cruiser damaged in the western mediterranean.Our destroyers have successfully attacked an enemy convoy in the Channel,E-boats have attacked shipping off our East Coast.   Shipping losses due toU-boats have been light.Two U-boats have been sunk and two probably sunk.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2.   Throughout the week, bad weather has caused considerable disorganisation-. tion of convoys proceeding to and from North Africa.3.   On the night of the 11th/ 12th, six destroyers attacked two escorted enemy ships proceeding down Channel off Dieppe.   One ship of 4,000 tons was sunk and the other probably sunk.  Two of the escorts were also sunk.  H.M. DestroyerWhitshed and the Dutch Destroyer Eskdale were damaged.   Our casualties were, seven killed and 48 wounded.4. On the 15th the German tanker Germania (9,851 tons), outward bound,was intercepted by the escorts of a homeward-bound convoy west of Finisterre.The ship was scuttled and nine officers and 62 ratings were taken prisoner.    .Early on the 17th H.M. Destroyer Firedrake, escorting an outward-bound convoy, was torpedoed and sunk in mid-Atlantic. Only 26 survivors have beenpicked jap.5. During air raids on the 16th damage was caused to the Royal MarineBarracks at Eastney, and a patrol vessel was sunk and the base ship and navalstore houses damaged at Poole.   Five ratings were wounded.Mediterranean.6. A convoy of two ships, escorted by six destroyers from Alexandria,arrived at Malta on the 14th without incident.7. On the 11th H.M. Destroyer Blean, on escort duty, was torpedoed and sunk N.W. of Oran. On the following night shipping in Algiers harbour was attacked by human torpedoes and 16 Italian prisoners were captured. On the13th H.M. Submarine P. 35, off the east coast of Tunisia, torpedoed a heavily-laden 3,000-ton ship, which was subsequently beached and was later torpedoed by naval aircraft.On the 14th H.M. Cruiser Argonaut, while returning from a sweep to the eastward, was torpedoed by aircraft off Bone, but reached Algiers on thefollowing day.H.M. Submarine Urstda blew up a train at Alassio and sank a schooner inthe Gulf of Genoa.8.   H.M. Submarine Traveller is overdue at Malta and is presumed lost.9. During the week, naval aircraft have successfully attacked shipping inBizerta harbour and on the supply route from Italy, details of which are givenin the Air Situation.Pacific. -10. On the 12th, 11 enemy destroyers, which had. been bombed by U.S.aircraft on the previous day while proceeding towards Guadalcanal Island, were attacked by&apos; US. Naval forces, which sank one destroyer, probably sank another and damaged a third.It was reported on the 11th that the US. Fleet Auxiliary A Ichiba (7,886 tons)had been sunk by enemy action.Anti-Submarine Operations.II. On the 10th a U-boat, which was attacking a homeward-bound convoy was probably sunk by a U.S. aircraft 350 miles south of Iceland (C).
The efficient air protection given to this convoy through a. large concentration of U-boats undoubtedly prevented! heavy losses. Details of attacks by surfaceescorts have not yet been analysed, but it is known that several promising attacks were carried out.On the 13th H.M. Sloop Enchantress, escorting a westbound convoy, probably sank a U-boat off Bougie. On the 15th H.M. Destroyer Petard and the GreekDestroyer Queen Olga destroyed a U-boat south of Malta. Thirty-five prisoners were captured.A belated report has been received that H.M. Submarine Tigris sank an italian U-boat N.E. of Bone on the 6th and) took four prisoners.Enemy Intelligence.German.12.   There is no change in the disposition of the German Fleet.Italian.&apos; 13. The three &quot; Littorio&quot; class battleships and two 8&quot; cruisers, whichrecently left Naples and Messina, respectively, have so far not been located.In addition to the 6&quot; cruiser sunk in Naples during the air raid on the 4th,it is considered that another 6&quot; cruiser was severely damaged.Traffic to Bizerta and Tunis has been maintained.Japanese.14. The heavy ships are thought to be in the Mandated Islands. One new16&quot; battleship, three 14&quot; battleships, two converted carriers, and one 8&quot; cruiserare available in reserve in Home Waters. A new type of large destroyer or light cruiser of about 3,000 tons has been seen recently in the S.W. Pacific. This shipresembled a &quot; Tribal&quot; class destroyer with four double turrets and one quadrupletorpedo tube.U-boats.15. During the week there has been considerable activity on the convoyroutes to and from the United States.A number of U-boats are patrolling to the west and N.W. of the Azores,N.E. of Brazil, and in the vicinity of St, Paul Rocks. The total number operating in the Atlantic is estimated at about 95.Two or three U-boats have recently entered the Mediterranean from the atlantic, and nine or ten are now believed&apos; to be operating in the western mediterranean. *Twenty-five U-boats are estimated to be based in Northern Waters, of whichfour or five are at Trondheim, nine or ten at Narvik, and the remainder possiblyat Bergen.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 13th/14th, 781 ships have been convoyed.Of these, 170 were in ocean convoys and 611 in British coastal convoys. - Oneanti-aircraft ship, 62 destroyers (including five U.S. destroyers), and 62 cuttersand corvettes (including two U.S. cutters), were employed on escort duties.During the week 85 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters.Two ships were lost.17. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 12th totalled 184,000 tons, compared with 717,352 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 531,700 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 36,003 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked eight ships, ofwhich five are known to have sunk. Three ships were torpedoed in an outward-bound convoy in mid-Atlantic.. One ship was sunk off Oran and another offLourenco Marques. A ship was torpedoed N.W. of St. Paul Rocks and anotherN.W. of the Azores. One ship was sunk and three torpedoed in an attack byhuman torpedoes on Algiers Harbour. Five ships, in coastal convoy, were sunk by E-boats off Lowestoft.[24782] b 2
British Minelaying.19.   There was no minelaying by surface craft during the week.Aircraft laid mines off the German North Sea Coast, in the Channel and bay of Biscay, and in the Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.20. Enemy aircraft have carried out minelaying operations off the east coast, from Blyth to the Thames Estuary, on four nights during the week.Three magnetic and two moored mines have been destroyed, bringing the minetotals to : acoustic 1,330, magnetic 2,741, and moored 1,903.Ms di tevvo/fhSQ/fi.21. Enemy aircraft were suspected of minelaying off Bone during the night of the 11th/12th.Enemy Merchant Shipping.22. Since the beginning of June 1942,- six Italian ships, totalling 29,641 tons,which were previously engaged in the Bilbao-Bayonne ore trade, have passed through the Straits of Dover.23. A large number of small Dutch vessels known as Groningen coastershave been requisitioned by the Germans for the following purposes : conversion into flak ships, escorts and naval auxiliaries, employment in the iron-ore trade between Bilbao and Bayonne, the coasting trade to the Channel Islands, and in norwegian waters. Others are to be transferred by inland routes to theMediterranean, Black Sea and to inland waterways in Germany.24. The Italian Tanker Celeno (3,741 tons) sailed from Istanbul on the 8thand entered the iEgean on the following day.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.Central Sector.25. The Russians have attempted to continue their offensive in the areawest of Moscow, while the Germans have delivered strong counter-attacks. Asa result of these counter-attacks it is claimed that a considerable Russian force has been encircled. There is no confirmation of this claim, but the Germansmay have regained some of the ground they had lost. In the last few days,however, a sudden thaw has set in, which is likely to hamper operations.Don-Stalingrad Sector.26. Despite Russian successes achieved over a week ago on the westernbank &quot;of the River Chir it appears likely that the Germans have throughoutretained a bridgehead over the Don at its confluence with the Chir. The mainRussian effort is still being directed against the German forces surrounded east of the Don, but no marked success in these operations has yet been claimed.South-west of Stalingrad, in the Kotelnikov area, the Germans have now launchedtheir expected counter-attack. The Russians are, however, resisting vigorouslyand there is no indication as yet that the attack has achieved much success.Summary.27. Just as last year the German attempt to reach Moscow was frustrated bythe early onset of winter, so this year the Russian offensive in the Central Sector isbeing hampered by the unexpected continuance of autumn weather. The hardfrost which normally prevails at this season has not held, and the thaw conditionsare aggravated by the marshy terrain. In the Don-Stalingrad Sector, the russian offensive has been held up by lack of communications and maintenance difficulties.There are no reports as to what efforts the German force surrounded at Stalingradhave made to break out, but if the German counter-attack from the Kotelnikovarea develops, their forces at Stalingrad will doubtless endeavour to break out
to the south-west in order to join hands. The Russians presumably hope to eliminate the enemy in the Stalingrad area before this can take place. It isstill too early to speculate on the outcome.Tunisia.28. On the 10th the enemy advanced on Medjez El Bab in two columns, bothof which were strongly supported by tanks and dive-bombers. We launchedimmediate counter-attacks and both enemy thrusts from the east and down thewest bank of the Medjerda river were repulsed. The enemy&apos;s losses included18 tanks.Roads and communications in the forward areas have been seriously affectedby the previous week&apos;s heavy rain. In order to gain more room for deployment, ageneral withdrawal was carried out during the 10th and 11th to a line runningroughly north-west from Testeur. This withdrawal was carried out in good order, but mud on the forward airfields prevented the R.A.F. from giving themaximum air cover and also compelled the U.S. armoured force to abandonmany of its tanks and vehicles.The strong French and British force left in Medjez El Bab has successfully resisted the enemy&apos;s attempts to penetrate the defences.In the Southern Sector, activity for the next few days was confined to activepatrolling south and south-east of Medjez El Bab. There were frequent minorclashes with enemy armoured patrols.There has been little activity on the Central and Northern Sectors beyondoffensive patrolling by both sides. On the 11th we carried out a small butsuccessful raid from our positions west of Mateur in the Jefna area. On thesame day the British armoured force that had been covering the withdrawalsuccessfully broke up an enemy advance southwards from Mateur.The strength of the Axis forces in Tunisia is now estimated at about 20,000Germans and 12,000 Italians with some 90-100 German and 40-50 Italian tanks.Libya.29. The indications that the enemy intended avoiding a major engagementon the El Agheila line became progressively stronger, and by the 9th our mobilepatrols reported Marada unoccupied.&quot; In the ISorth our infantry formationsmade nightly raids on an increasing scale, locating about 40 enemy tanks and small infantry formations.On three successive nights of the 9th, 10th and 11th patrols penetrated some4,000 yards into the enemy positions between MersaEl Brega on the coast toMaaten Giofer in the centre of the line, meeting with little opposition andculminating with an advance, of 3,000 yards which was consolidated by the evening of the 12th. During this period an armoured-car formation made a longand valuable reconnaissance to within 5 miles of Marble Arch, 60 miles west ofMersa El Brega, meeting no opposition and reporting the route suitable for thepassage of troops.On the night of the 12th/13th the enemy started to withdraw his mosteasterly formations, and by the 13th he was in full retreat. The 8th Armyfollowed up this retreat in two main formations, one moving from east to west and directed on El Agheila, whilst the other by-passed the main enemy positionto the south of Maaten Giofer, moving in a north-westerly direction.Our pursuit of the enemy has been delayed by extensive and cleverly concealedmine-fields, but by the evening of the 14th our forward troops in the north were approximately 5 miles east of El Agheila, whilst those to the south were about30 miles N.N.W. of Marada.By the 15th our infantry were in El Agheila, and our armoured formationsin the north were in contact with enemy rear guards 25 miles south-west of that point. The southern column, consisting of an infantry division, had reachedMerduma, 12 miles south-west of Marble Arch, and our armoured cars had cut the coast road at a point 12 miles north-west of Marble Arch.On the 16th our armoured formations were at grips with the enemy rearguardat Marble Arch and the column to the south had moved from Merduma to aposition across the coastal road in the area of Matratin, 35 miles east of Nofila,taking up positions in Wadi Rigel.. The 8th Army has cut off some of the. rearward troops of the enemy column,which include some mobile forces. The main column continues its difficult retreatalong the coast road.[24782] / B 3
Both, railway and ports continue to handle a satisfactory tonnage, andBenghazi especially is showing a gratifying increase over last week.Far East.Burma.30. The Japanese have strengthened their forces forward of Akyab, andtheir total strength in this area is now estimated at 2,000. Japanese patrols havepenetrated 30 miles north of Myitkyina.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.31. U.S. forces, having occupied Buna on the 14th, are. engaged in mopping-up Japanese positions to the east of the village. Australian troops continue tomake progress against the Japanese positions at Sanananda.The Japanese have landed troops at the mouths of the Amboga, Kumusi andMambare Rivers, 15, 22 and 50 miles respectively up the coast from Buna.Allied air forces have inflicted considerable casualties in men and material onthese forces, and Australian patrols are in contact with the Japanese position atthe mouth of the Amboga River. The Japanese in the Buna area are now estimated to number 3,000.Timor.32.. The Japanese strength in Portuguese Timor is now reported to be ,000, and they appear to be making determined efforts to break the resistance of the Allied guerilla forces. The enemy strength in Koepang (Dutch Timor)may now be 2,000, and not 20,000 as reported in last week&apos;s Resume.Solomons.33. The Japanese at Buin, in the South-West Solomons, are now estimated to number 20,000.AIR SITUATION.General Review.34. In Libya, fighters and light-bombers co-operated with the 8th Army andheavily attacked retreating enemy transport.Bizerta and Tunis were successfully attacked.Successful, attacks were made on enemy shipping in Home Waters, in theMediterranean and in the South-West Pacific.United Kingdom.35. Enemy air activity showed a slight increase. Totals of 40 and 23enemy aircraft crossed our coasts by day and by night respectively, In daylightfour enemy aircraft were destroyed and eight damaged, and at night one was shot down.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.36. Seventy-eight u.s.. Fortresses, with fighter cover and support, were despatched to attack the Romilly-sur-Seine aircraft park and airfield, but as there was thick cloud over the whole area, no attack was made. However, 17 ofthese aircraft bombed, as an alternative, the railway centre at Solleville (Rouen)on which they dropped 36 tons of HE. and incendiary bombs. Visibility waspoor but some bursts were seen in the target area.Diversions were carried out over the Abbeville/Drucat airfield by Liberatorsand over the Havre, St. Omer and Gravelines areas by Spitfires.The Fortresses destroyed 19 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 10 and damaged two. A further four were destroyed by Spitfires. We lost two Fortressesand four Spitfires.Our fighters and fighter bombers continued their harassing attacks on enemy communications and other objectives. Among the targets hit were the marshalling yards at Ghent, Laon, Creil and Amiens, several locomotives, two locomotiverepair sheds, numerous barges and a military camp.
Night.37. Owing to adverse weather conditions, no large-scale operation wascarried out during the week.Three Stirlings bombed the Diepholz aircraft park, 35 miles south-west ofBremen, and five other Stirlings bombed neighbouring towns.Fourteen intruders operated over Northern France and the Low Countries.Propaganda leaflets were dropped on Paris and on towns in North-Eastern Franceand Belgium.Northern Italy.38. A force of 82 aircraft was despatched to make a night attack on Turin.Thick cloud and severe icing conditions all the way over France prevented themajority from reaching their objective. Twenty-seven aircraft reached Turinon which they dropped 27 tons Of FI.E. (including 8 x 4,000 lbs.) and 28 tons ofincendiaries. Visibility was poor but a 4,000-lb. H.E. bomb was seen to fall ona factory in the south of the town.   Three aircraft are missing and two crashed.Coastal Operations.39. Torpedo-carrying HampdeUs attacked shipping off the south coast of norway.   A 4,000-ton ship was hit and another was probably hit.A convoy of 12 ships off The Hague was attacked by Hudsons. A 4,000-ton ship was hit and another of 3,000 tons was damaged.Spitfires attacked four small ships and a flak ship off the Dutch Coast. one ship was set on fire and the flak ship was damaged. Other Spitfires damaged a2,000-ton tanker off Ostend.The following were also attacked but results were not observed : (a) A 1,500-ton ship off the West Coast of Norway.(&amp;) A 2,000-ton ship off the South-West Coast of Norway.(c) A 3,000-ton ship south-west of Brest.\d) A 2/3,000-ton ship in the Bay of Biscay.A total of 97 aircraft laid 211 sea-mines in enemy waters.Mediterranean.French North Africa.40. The docks and shipping at Tunis and Bizerta were the principal targets for our bombers. In daylight, attacks were made by strong formations of TJ.S.Fortresses and Liberators, the largest number operating on any one day being 45.At night the raids were carried out by Wellingtons based on Malta and byBisleys from North Africa. Many hits were obtained in the target area.Damage was caused to warehouses, barrack buildings, oil storage, railwaymarshalling yards and large -fires were reported in dockside buildings; the severity of the damage was confirmed by photographic reconnaissance. TheTunis end of the Canal was partially blocked by sand and gravel. On the night of the 13th/14th two large ships and one small ship were set on fire, and again on the following night three hits were claimed on ships, one of which was still burning the following day. In daylight operations another ship was sunk andothers were hit.A torpedo attack in daylight by naval Swordfish was made at Ferry Ville(south of Bizerta) and one ship, probably a tanker, burst into flames; another was believed hit by two torpedoes. Tunis/El Aouina airfield was bombed by sevenU.S. Liberators and many bursts were seen on the airfield and in the dispersalarea. Twelve U.S. Bostons bombed Massicault and 12 others obtained hits onthe railway junction east of Mateur. Four Spitfires destroyed three Me. 109s onMateur airfield and also hit a petrol dump.A successful attack was made on the harbour at Sousse by six U.-S. Mitchellsescorted by Lightnings. One large ship and storage sheds were destroyed andanother large ship was hit. Beaufighters from Malta also set a warehouse on fire, together with cargo on the quay. Other successful attacks by U.S. bomberson the railway targets at Sfax resulted in serious damage to the railway repairdepot. Beaufighters also shot up trains on the Sousse-Sfax-railway, Mines, were laid by naval Albacores in Sousse harbour.
Fighter sweeps were maintained over the Tunis-Bizerta area, but no serious opposition was encountered. Fighters and fighter bombers attacked enemy tanks,and on one occasion our land-forces reported that the action was most successful.Patrols were flown in protection of our shipping and also against U-boats.Enemy activity has been somewhat limited by adverse weather conditions.Our attacks on the Axis ports in Tunisia and shipping and on transport aircraft,as well as the extension of our operations to Sousse and Sfax, forced the enemy to expend much of his fighter effort in protective patrols and to distribute hiseffort over a wide area. In two enemy attacks on Bone our night fighters destroyed seven enemy bombers.Libya.41. During the earlier part of the week our fighter-bombers made heavy attacks with bombs and guns on the. landing grounds at Marble Arch and Nofilia,on gun emplacements and encampments in the Mersa Brega area and on M.T.On the 13th the enemy withdrew from Mersa Brega. Our fighter-bomberscontinuously attacked his M.T., and a record total of nearly 300 bombing and machine-gunning sorties was flown, many vehicles being destroyed or damaged.Thereafter, the attacks continued by day and night and on the 15th our light bombers also participated. More concentrated targets were found in the wadisand in the Marble Arch area, and on the 16th excellent results were obtained in theNofilia area, although our aircraft were subjected to intense A.A. fire. Enemyopposition was not on a heavy scale and it is likely that part, at least, of the avail-able forces had retired to airfields further in the rear. Fourteen enemy fighters were destroyed and 16 of ours are missing. U.S. fighters and bombers co-operated in these operations.Shipping protection- patrols were flown off Cyrenaica from the Delta toBenghazi.Mines were dropped in the approaches to Tripoli harbour on two nights, andthe W/T station was bombed.Our aircraft flew a total of 2,042 sorties.Attacks on Enemy Shipping and Transport Aircraft.42.

Ships Arethusa, Ibis, Walney andMarigold.APPENDIX YI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : -France.Lille.It is learned from photographs and other sources that as a result of attacks by U.S. Fortresses on the 8th November and the 6th December (a) At Ateliers d&apos;Hellems 1. The repair shops were seriously damaged over at least one-thirdof their area.   In addition there is a 40-foot hole in that partof the roof that remained.2. The machine shops were seriously damaged on both occasions.3. The Repair Sheds have two holes in their roof, one of 60 ft. andone of 40 ft. diameter.4. The west end of the Bogie Yards, the Wood-working shops,Foundry and two large sheds were severely damaged.5. Over ten locomotives were destroyed and many others damaged.Traffic on the railways was- seriously interfered with forseveral days because of a shortage of engines.6. A turntable was hit and j ammed for a considerable time.At Fives-Lille 1. The roof was stripped from one bay of the multi-bay Iron Foundry.2. The Pattern Shop. Joinery Shop and Erection Shop, General Storeand an unidentified factory building were damaged.   several of these are being; reroofed.The Crespel Spinning Mills received two more direct hits and a nearbylarge industrial building was damaged.Locomotives were unable to use the Engine Depot at Lille for three days,the lines having been blocked by several bomb hits.Italy.Turin A reliable source reports that Macchi have been forced to hold upconstruction of their 202&apos;s as a result of shortage of engines owing to damage caused in our attacks.Another source states that the repeated attacks have been most effective and make attempts at reorganisation most difficult. The effect on the population isnoticeable as they have, been unwilling to co-operate in reorganisation, a task which they consider hopeless.Sea-Mining.The following results are reported : (i) On the 19th September a Swedish minesweeper was sunk off Helsingborg.(ii) On the 1st October the Norwegian Ama of 4,325 tons was sunk off the entrance to Swinemunde.Appendices I, II, III and IY will be published periodically.
