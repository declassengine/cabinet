NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   Two convoys have arrived at Malta from the Eastern Mediterranean.A Japanese force which attempted to carry reinforcements to Guadalcanalhas been driven off with severe loss by US. ships.Three U-boats have probably been sunk and others have been damaged.Shipping losses, all due to U-boats, in the North Atlantic, have beencomparatively light. &apos;&apos;Some 87 French merchant ships in North African ports have come ,under allied control.Home Waters.2. On the night the 3rd /4th, off Lowestoft, 3 M.G.Bs. engaged and damaged3 E-boats at close range.  Our craft received slight damage and 1 minor casualty.Northern Waters.3. The last 3 Russian ships independently routed from North Russia arrived in Iceland (C) on the 5th. .Mediterranean.4.

P. 217 obtained3 torpedo hits on a northbound convoy of 2 ships, escorted by destroyers, southof Naples on the 5th.  P. 219 sank a ship north-east of Bizerta.Naval aircraft attacked ships off Tripoli and, in co-operation with theR.A.F., bombed an airfield in southern Italy.Black Sea.7. On the 1st, in the Western Black Sea, Russian warships sank a 10,000-tontanker and 2 ships of 2,000/3,000 tons, and probably sank a gunboat and 2 small craft.A Russian submarine sank a ship of medium size on the 27th November.West Africa.8. An explosion, believed to have been caused by jettisoned petrol, occurred in Lagos harbour on the 5th. H.M. Trawlers Bengali, Canna and Spaniard were sunk and H.M. Trawler Kelt was wrecked. The dockyard was badly damaged and put out of action. There were a number Of casualties, including 21 missing,presumed killed. t9. The ss. Dunedin Star (12,891), bound from the United Kingdom to theMiddle East with war stores, was beached after striking a submerged object north of Walfiseh Bay on the 29th November and has since been abandoned.Pacific-Timor.10. H.M. Australian Minesweeper Armidale, carrying relief personnel, was sunk by aircraft on the 1st, south-east of Timor. Twenty survivors have beenrescued.
Solomons.11. On the night 30th/1st, US&quot;, ships engaged a Japanese force of12 destroyers, with some transports, which was approaching Guadalcanal from thenorth-west. Six Japanese destroyers, 2 transports and a cargo ship were sunk and the remainder of the enemy retired. It is estimated that some 8,000troops were killed.   One U.S. Cruiser was sunk and other ships were damaged.A leutians.12.   Attu Island has been reoccupied by the Japanese.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. On the 4th, one U-boat was probably sunk by H.M. Destroyer Eskimonorth-west of Eizerta, and another by H.M. Minesweeper Cadmus north of Tenez.On the 8th, a Liberator aircraft made 8 attacks in the vicinity of a homeboundconvoy 450-550 miles south-west of Iceland (C) and&apos;. probably destroyed a U-boatin the first attack. A Wellington damaged a U-boat, which was last seen on the surface, north of Or an on the 4th.Three other attacks by surface craft and 21 by aircraft are reported to havebeen carried out during the period midnight 2nd/3rd to midnight 9th/10th. Ofthe attacks by aircraft, one west of the Shetlands and 2 in the western mediterranean probably damaged the U-boats. The majority of the attacks weremade in the Western Mediterranean and west of Gibraltar.Enemy Intelligence.German..14. The 6&quot; Cruiser IS! umber g is believed to have arrived in extremeNorthern Waters from the Baltic. Otherwise there, has been no change in the disposition of the German fleet. *The Tirpitz is reported to be undergoing major repairs in Lofiord, Trondheim.Italian.15. A reconnaissance of Naples on the 5th showed that a cruiser of the&quot; Attendolo&quot; class (6&quot;, 1934) was sunk in the harbour. (See under &quot;air situation.&quot;) A further reconnaissance, on the 7th, showed that the 3 &quot; Littorio &quot;class battleships, with a number of destroyers, were no longer present.The traffic to Bizerta and Tunis has continued; but there has again beenvery little to Tripoli (L).Japanese.. 16. Two regular aircraft carriers, which have been, repairing in Japanesehome-waterST-are likely to be ready for service shortly.U-boats.17. There is increasing activity both east and west of Gibraltar, and patrolsare being maintained between Madeira and Portugal. U-boats are still operating in the south-eastern Caribbean and off Guiana, and it is thought that 6 are off thenorth-east coast of Brazil. The total number operating in the Atlantic isestimated at about 90.In the Indian Ocean there is now probably only one German U-boat.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 6th/7th, 964 ships have been convoyed.Of these, 213 were in ocean convoys&quot; and 751 in British coastal convoys. One anti-aircraft ship, 56 destroyers (including 4 U.S. destroyers) and 48 cutters and corvettes (including 5 US. cutters) were employed on escort duties.During the week, 144 ships in 5 ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters. one ship was lost.19. During the month of November, 9. homeward-bound ocean convoys of231 ships arrived in the United Kingdom without loss and 3 convoys, originally of126 ships, lost 33 (of which 3 were stragglers) before arrival. ( In the same period,9 outward-bound ocean convoys of 200 snips arrived at their destinations without loss, except for a convoy which lost a straggler, and 3 convoys, originally of.   [24740] 1 t*
100 ships, lost 8 before arrival. In the Western Atlantic and Caribbean, 159convoys of 1,965 ships were escorted to their destinations without loss and2 convoys lost 9 ships of their total of 82.20. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 5th totalled 717,537 tons, compared with 341,194 tons during theprevious 7 days and an average of 573,957 tons for the past 10 weeks. Of theweek&apos;s imports 308,193 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.21. During, the week U-boats are reported to have attacked 5 ships, ofwhich 3 are known to have sunk. Two ships in a homeward bound convoy were torpedoed S.E. of Greenland.The s.s. Peter Maersk (5,476 tons) bound for the Middle East with warstores and the s.s. Ceramic (18,713 tons) outward bound for Australia with government personnel and war stores, were torpedoed west of the Azores. one ship wa,s sunk east of Trinidad.A ship was damaged by air attack at Philippeville.22. Shipping losses from enemy action during November, as recorded todate, total 695,000 tons : of this total 632,000 tons, or about 91 per cent., was due to U-boats.The bulk of the losses occurred on the trade routes of the North and south atlantic: U-boats being particularly active in the North-West Approaches and,in the South Atlantic, off the north coast of Brazil and the Cape of Good Hope.U-boats also heavily attacked shipping off the east coast of Africa. No losses orattacks have been reported from the Pacific.Of the total, 134.000 tons was lost in the course of the French North Africanoperations, largely due to U-boats operating west of Gibraltar and in the western mediterranean.EigHt tankers were lost during the month.British Minelaying.23. There was no minelaying by surface craft during the week, iiircraftlaid mines on a heavy scale in the Baltic, off the German North Sea coast and inthe Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.24. Enemy aircraft laid mines on two nights of the week off the South-east coast and on one night off the Humber. E-boats may possibly have been mine-laying on one night off Yarmouth.Clearance was. begun of an enemy minefield east of the North Foreland, inwhich some 45 mines were destroyed. Three magnetic mines have been destroyed during the week.The mine totals are : Acoustic, E330; magnetic, 2,738; moored, 1,901.Foreign Waters.25. Minelaying is suspected off Philippeville. A dangerous area has been declared from Bizerta to 50 miles north-eastward, where enemy minelayers haverecently been operating. &apos; Swept channels have been established at Bone andBougie. .Enemy Merchant Shipping.26. The German tanker Ailtarktis (10,711 tons) left Ferrol on the 8th andwas sighted on the following day, east of Cape Ortegal, steering eastward,escorted by escort vessels and aircraft.The Italian tanker Celeno (3,741 tons) arrived fully laden at IstanbulfromConstanza on the 5th.The Italian blockade-runner Pietro Orseolo (6,344 tons), which sailed fromthe Bay of Biscay in early October, is reported to have left Batavia, presumablyfor Japan.French Merchant Shipping.27. As the result of the North African operations it is estimated that some67 French ships, totalling upwards of 266,000 tons, have come under Allied
control. The Colombie (13,391 tons) and 14 other ships are believed to have been damaged. There are 26 ships at Algiers, including &quot;the Champollion (12,546 tons)and the A thos II. (15,276 tons), which had been laid up.In addition, 6 ships (15,662 tons) were sunk at Oran, four (39,029 tons) were sunk at Casablanca and three (13,000 tons) were damaged and beached south-west of Rabat.vichy French Intelligence.28. Air reconnaissance of Toulon on the 3rd showed that a dry dock hadbeen pumped out and that 2 of the submarines were apparently intact.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.29. The Russian offensive west of Moscow continues. It is encounteringdetermined resistance on the part of the Germans, who are fighting in fortifiedpositions and were apparently prepared to meet an attack in this sector. Russianprogress is reported to have been impeded by blizzards and by the naturaldifficulties of the country, which, when not frozen, is largely marshland, inter-sected by small rivers.Voronezh Sector.30. There is as yet no confirmation of the reported opening of a large-scaleRussian attack in the Voronezh area.Don-Stalingrad Sector. , *31. The Russians have established one or two bridgeheads on the westernbank of the River Chir. Their main effort, however, appears to have been directed against the German force-estimated by them at some 200;000 strong encircled east of the Don bend. South of the Don there has been no apparentchange in the situation.The Germans, for their part, claim to have cut Russian communications inthe Eastern Caucasian steppe. Neither the place nor the scale of their attackis known.Caucasus Sector.32. Continued fighting appears to have been taking place in the area of theRiver Terek, where some success is claimed by the Germans.Summary.33. Owing partly to bad weather and partly to stiffened German resistance,there has been no fresh Russian progress of importance in either of the two mainareas of attack the area west of Moscow and the Don-Stalingrad area. Withthe deepening of winter it&apos;can be assumed the Russians will be prevented from pursuing their offensive on the Central Sector on any scale much greater than was possible during last winter.34. In the Don area, on the other hand, there is normally no heavy snow,and when the frost returns the Russians may be able to push on there, provided they can overcome the lack of communications from which they must suffer solong as the encircled&apos; army remains in existence. , Meanwhile the mild weather,with consequent mud, may affect the German ability to launch any counter-stroketo relieve the surrounded 6th Army just, as it affects the Russian ability to destroy it.Tunisia.35. Casualties in the fighting between the 1st and 3rd were heavy on bothsides. By the 5th the British column in Tebourba had been forced to withdrawand was regrouping on the heights overlooking the-town.   On the following day[24740]      &apos; b 2
the enemy attacked our positions from El Bathan and Massicault which lie tothe south of Tebourba and succeeded in penetrating a position held by the americans round El Guessa (5 miles south-west of Tebourba). Despite two deter-,mined counter-attacks it was not until the 7th that the Americans succeeded in restoring the situation. Meanwhile on the night of the 6/7th the British columnhad been, withdrawn to Medjes-el-Bab for reorganisation.Activity for the next two days was confined to offensive patrolling by bothsides. The enemy withdrew behind his outer defences, and the Allied forces have been taking the opportunity to bring up reserves, push on with the construc-tion of forward landing grounds, and generally improve their heavily overstrainedadministrative resources. Reports on the 9th confirm that there are no enemywest of the line Massicault-Pont du Fans.Libya.36. During the last week there has been no change in the disposition ofour forward troops. Infantry and armoured formations face the enemy in theMersa Brega line and the concentration of our forces is almost complete. Therehas been little activity to the rear of his present position. Limited patrollinghas been carried1 out during the week and we maintain the initiative.Pacific Zone.New (guinea.37. In the Buna-Gona area the Japanese continue to offer stubbornresistance to the Allied attacks and have made several attempts to landreinforcements. Their defended localities are, however, being slowly destroyed.The Japanese have had the advantage of a firm coastal strip with a lateral road,and with strong positions covering the main tracks leading into Buna andSanananda. It has been difficult to deploy off these tracks, as the country on the inland side of the villages is covered with swamps several miles wide. australian troops, have, however, now infiltrated through the swamps and &quot;hold Gona and the coastal area between Buna and Sanananda.Further important reinforcements have been flown up from Port Moresby tothe forward area, together with equipment, including 25-prs. and U.S. 105-mm.field guns. The considerable forces in the Buna-Gona area are being largelysupplied by air.   The Japanese strength is now estimated to be 3,500.Timor.38. Japanese reinforcements have reached Dilli, capital of PortugueseTimor where the enemy force consists of about 12,000 men. There may also be another 20,000 in Koepang (Dutch Timor).Solomons.39. Parties of U.S. troops raided five enemy bases in the mountainousjungle of Guadalcanal on the 7th and succeeded in killing not less than 400Japanese.   Enemy strength on the Island is now estimated to be 20,000.Intelligence.France.40. It is now believed the 10th Panzer Division has left France and is in transit via Italy to Tunisia. Elements of the division have been identified inbattle there, but it is not considered that more than the first flight can so farhave arrived. The 6th Panzer Division has left France, possibly on the way toRussia.   It is being replaced in France by the 159th Training Division.Far East.41. The number of Japanese divisions in North China has been reduced from nine to eight; one division becomes unlocated, bringing the total of unlocateddivisions to eight.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.42. Heavy daylight attacks were made on a radio factory in Holland andon steel mills in France. Our aircraft made two successful night raids on Turin.A large number of sea-mines were laid in enemy waters.Naples was attacked in daylight. Heavy air activity continued in french north Africa.United Kingdom.43. Enemy air activity was again on a very small scale. In daylight atotal of 16 enemy aircraft crossed our coasts. One F.W 190 was destroyed nearFriston.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.44. Two hundred P.A.F..and U.S.A.A.F. bombers were despatched on one day against electro-chemical works at Eindhoven (40 miles south of Utrecht)and steel works at Lille. Thirty squadrons of fighters provided cover, with-drawal support and diversions.The Philips works at Eindhoven was attacked from low level by 78 aircraft.This is the largest plant in Europe engaged in the production of radio valvesand consists of two parts the main factory situated outside the town and thesmaller but equally important assembly plant half-a-mile away in a built-up area.The entire production of these plants, which were specially active lately, hadbeen absorbed by the German armed forces. A force of 93 light bombers, comprisedof Venturas, Bostons and Mosquitos, was despatched and 67 tons of bombs were dropped. At the main plant, hits were seen on the boiler-houses, erection shops,bakelite factory, laboratories and stores and many sections of the target were lefton fire. At the assembly plant, hits were reported on all parts of the valve factorybuildings, walls were seen to collapse and parts of the works appeared to be guttedby fire. The target was known to be well defended by heavy and light anti-aircraft guns around the works and on the roofs; 13 of our aircraft did not return and another crashed, the crew being rescued.Sixty-six U.S. Fortresses were despatched to bomb the Fives-Lille steel and engineering works; cover and support was provided by 16 squadrons of Spit-fires, including three U.S. squadrons. The target was subjected to a highaltitude attack by 37 bombers, which dropped about 85 tons of bombs. Severalhits were made on the objective and two bombs were seen to burst on a nearbyrailway yard; other hits were observed in the vicinity. In combat, our fighters destroyed 2 enemy aircraft; probably destroyed another and damaged 2 more,while provisional claims by the bombers include 9 destroyed and 7 damaged.Diversions were carried out by 19 Liberators on Abbeville-Drucat&apos;airfield and,in conjunction with a fighter sweep, by 18 Fortresses on Dunkirk.Fighters and fighter-bombers continued their harassing attacks on com-munications and other targets in enemy territory at least 3 locomotives are known to have been destroyed and 17 more locomotives and numerous trucks andcoaches were damaged. Several barges were sunk and others hit; an electricaltransformer, lock-gates, gun-posts and troops were machine-gunned, and bombs were dropped at five points along the Emden-Munster railway. From these operations 4 aircraft are missing. (Some of the effects of our attacks on loco-motives are reported in Appendix VII.)Night.45. Bombing was carried out on one night only, when  a strong force hadMannheim for its objective. The aiming-point was not visually identified, due tolow, heavy cloud. Nearly 600 tons of bombs were dropped by 217 aircraft, but,apart from the glow of scattered fires reflected on the clouds, results wereunobserved. Nine aircraft are missing and 5 crashed; about half the members ofthe latter&apos;s crews being rescued.   Two enemy fighters were shot down.Propaganda Leaflets.46. During the month of November a greater weight of leaflets was droppedthan in. any previous month; the total number amounted to 42,469,500. the leaflets, many of which contained as many as eight pages, were distributed over
France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg, Holland and Norway. Bomber,Fighter and Army Co-operation Commands were engaged in this mission.In order to spread the news of the occupation of Algeria and Moroccothroughout the whole of France, three very large operations were carried out by bomber Command over 12 million were dropped on one night and everyimportant district was covered, including Marseilles and Toulon. Largequantities of leaflets were delivered, during the raids on Italy, over Milan, Turinand Genoa.Northern Italy.47. Turin was raided on two consecutive nights by home-based Lancasters,Stirlings, Halifaxes and Wellingtons.The first attack was made by 117 aircraft; the bombs dropped, whichtotalled 270 tons, included 4 x 8,000 lb. H.E. Visibility was good and, in the40 minutes during which our aircraft were over the city, large fires were started;these were reported to be well concentrated in the centre of the target. All our aircraft returned, with the exception of one Lancaster.On the following night the attack was repeated by a force of 196 aircraft,which dropped a total of 393 tons of bombs. Much ground haze and smokeinterfered with the early stages of the raid, but concentration improved later,after incendiaries took hold. Three notably large fires were seen in the railway centre and in the area occupied by the Fiat works; numerous other new fires wereburning elsewhere in the industrial district. Three of our aircraft did not return.   An enemy night-fighter was shot down.Coastal Operations.48. Routine patrols were carried out against U-boats and enemy shipping,convoys were escorted and reconnaissances flown.A Hampden torpedoed a,5,000-ton ship off Aalesund (Norway). Hurricaneand Whirlwind bombers damaged three 1,500-ton ships, two E-boats and twolighters&apos;off the coast of Brittanv.A total of 180 aircraft laid 548 sea-mines in enemy waters.Eleven aircraft are missing and two crashed.Mediterranean.French North Africa.49. Our Malta-based bombers and Allied bombers based on North Africamade the docks and shipping at Bizerta their principal target, with smaller scaleattacks on Tunis and enemy airfields. Air activity towards the latter part ofthe week was greatly restricted by bad weather.The docks at Bizerta were attacked on five nights by Wellingtons and Bisleys,and four daylight attacks were made on the same target by U.S. Fortresses andMarauders escorted by Lightnings; a total of 120 bomber sorties was flown.Extensive damage was done and large fires started; hits were made on severalships, the railway station, fuel cisterns, warehouses and jetties. During the daylight attacks US. fighters destroyed a number of Me. 109s.The docks at Tunis were attacked at night by 27 Wellingtons from malta and, in daylight, by 15 Fortresses escorted by Lightnings. Hits were made proportionate least 2 ships, and on warehouses, jetties, and railway sidings, where a 4,000-lb.bomb was seen to burst..The principal attacks against enemy airfields were directed against SidiAhmed at Bizerta and El Aouina at Tunis. During one of these attacks15 enemy aircraft on the ground were either destroyed or damaged. Duringanother attack 5 U.S. escorting Lightnings were shot down. Small scale attacks were carried out against the airfields at Sfax and Djedeida.Support for our forward troops was provided by bombers and fighters, andmany offensive sweeps were flown over the battle area. Enemy air reaction was considerable, and heavy A.A. fire was encountered.A particularly successful attack was made by 12 Bisleys and 6 Bostons ontroops and vehicles in the forward area, but on another occasion 6 of 10 Bisleys,despatched to attack enemy positions, were lost, and the remaining 4 forcedlanded. Formations of enemy fighters were encountered and numerous combatstook place, and although, at times, heavy air fighting developed, on neither sidewere casualties heavy.. Lightnings, during an attack on troops and vehicles,destroyed 2 Me. 210s, some of the first to be seen in this area.
Allied aircraft maintained reconnaissance and patrols over all sectors and provided escorts for shipping. During these operations in one day 9 enemy aircraft were destroyed, and on 2 nights Beaufighters destroyed 11 enemy aircraftthat were attacking Bone. On another occasion during reconnaissances of thesouthern area .7 enemy aircraft were shot down.Hurricanes and Beaufighters from Malta carried out offensive reconnaissancesover the east coast of Tunisia. A section of railway line between Kerker andEl Djem was destroyed and the railway junction at Ouardenino was hit.Locomotives were attacked, an oil tank set on fire, and a schooner and a smallship hit by cannon fire. Further attacks were made in this area by fighters based in North Africa; 3 transport aircraft being destroyed on the ground .at Gabesand 2 in the air near Sfax, At least 8 enemy transport aircraft were shot downby Beaufighters and a number of others damaged. Wellingtons, unable to locateBizerta, bombed and hit a destroyer in the dockyard at Sidi Abdulla (40 miles .E. of Sfax).Enemy air operations have again been on a heavy, scale, although during thelatter the week some reduction has been reported.   In addition to dive-bomber and fighter attacks, long-range bombers have been reported operating against our ground troops in the Tunisian battle area. Heavy attacks have beenmade on our tank and artillery positions in which long-range bombers have been identified. Bone was heavily attacked. An ammunition train was bombed inthe station at Souk Ahras. In an -attack on the airfield at Medjes El Bab 2 ofour fighters were destroyed and 4 damaged.Libya.50. Allied aircraft flew 1,500 sorties during the week. Offensive patrols were maintained over our forward troops. Shipping protection patrols were flown off the coast of Cyrenaica, and during one day 3 Ju. 88s were destroyed.At night Liberators made 2 attacks on Tripoli, and one attack on Misurata;Wellingtons in bad weather bombed the landing ground at Marble Arch.In daylight escorted fighter bombers made 5 attacks on the landing groundat Marble Arch. In the last of these attacks U.S. war hawks, of which one is missing, shot down 6 Me. 109s. Offensive sorties by fighters and fighter bombers were mainly directed against gun positions at Mersa Brega and road traffic inthe Sirte area.There has been little change in enemy air operations. Attacks have beenmade against our forward positions and against M.T. concentrations and tankmovements in the immediate rear. Reconnaissances have been made as far eastas Agedabia.   Two ineffective attacks were made on Benghazi.Malta.51. During the week, our aircraft flew 666 sorties. Reconnaissances weremade of enemy ports and airfields, and shipping protection patrols were main-tained, these latter being considerably increased during the unloading of a convoy.Beaufighters on, offensive patrols in the area of Pantellaria attacked two enemy destroyers with cannon and machine-gun fire.. A few formations of enemy aircraft approached the Island, but in all cases,on sighting our fighters, turned back. Two Ju. 88s were shot down, one of whichwas carrying a torpedo.Southern Italy and Sicily.52. On the 4th, 24 U.S. Liberators based on Libya bombed in daylightshipping and harbour installations at Naples. Among the bombs dropped were33 of 2,000 lbs.; hits were made on shipping, the railway yards, quays and in thetown. A photographic reconnaissance the next day revealed that a 6-inch cruiserhad been sunk and severe damage done to warehouses.Eighteen Wellingtons bombed the Sicilian airfields at Catania, Syracuse,Comiso and Gerbini; a number of 4,000-lb. bombs were used. Three Spitfirescarrying bombs attacked the airfield at Gela. Beaufighters and a Naval Albacorebombed the airfield at Reggio di Calabria in southern Italy.A attacks on Enemy Shipping.. 53. Naval Albacores from Malta torpedoed and sank a ship of 3,000 tonsand probably sank another of the same size. Both ships were south-bound and attacked about 44 miles north of Zuara.
Gibraltar.54c. Two hundred and twenty-seven sorties were flown on anti-U-boat and shipping protection patrols. Twenty-three U-boats were sighted and nine attacks were made.Crete.55. Twenty-three Wellingtons and Halifaxes made attacks on the airfield at Heraklion; four fires were started, but observation of results was hampered bybad weather.Russia.56. The Russians are thought to have air superiority in the Stalingradarea over the surrounded German forces, and they appear to be using their advantage by concentrating attacks on German air-borne -supplies. Attacks were also made on the German occupied airfields of Millerovo, Tazinskaya and moscow Skaya and communications in use by the enemy for bringing up supplies.It is probable that some 200 German transport aircraft have been withdrawnfrom the Southern Russian Front to the Mediterranean and this, together withthe losses caused by Russian fighters, is probably increasing the difficulties ofcarrying supplies by air to the large number of troops surrounded.It is of interest that among the transport aircraft used by the germans in this area are a number of old type He. Ill and Ju. 86.During the week ending the 5th, the Russians report the destruction of192 enemy aircraft, including 108 three-engined transport aircraft, against 102of their Own.Burma.57.   Bad flying weather curtailed Allied operations.Chittagong harbour was r*aided by 24 Japanese bombers, escorted by 12fighters; the attack was unsuccessful, the sole result being one barge sunk,Mohawks, one of which was shot down (pilot rescued), destroyed a bomber and a fighter and another of the raiders was damaged.*Indian Ocean.58. Three enemy aircraft bombed the cable station on Cocos Island withouteffect.Pacific Zone.59. Strong forces of Allied aircraft were active throughout the week in theBuna-Gona area, both in close support to our troops and in offensive sortiesagainst various targets. Machine-gun posts and A..A. guns were silenced, bargesdestroyed and raids carried out on airfields at Kavieng, Gasmata and Lae.Eighteen enemy bombers, with an escort of 16 fighters, attacked the harbourarea at Porlock, the landing slip at Popondetta and shipping in the vicinity.No damage has been reported. Kittyhawks and Airacobras, without loss to themselves, destroyed 5 dive-bombers, 6 medium bombers and 7 fighters. Japanese aircraft dropped supplies by parachute over Buna and in the Sananandra area.South of Rabaul, Fortresses bombed and probably hit one of a force of six destroyers, southbound. Fifteen enemy fighters attacked our bombers which,without incurring losses themselves, shot down 8, probably destroyed another and damaged 2.   The naval force was later reported to be returning north.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.60. There has been a slight increase in the number of attacks by enemy aircraft, but there has been no serious damage and few casualties. By day 28attacks with cannon and machine-gun fire have been reported in Kent, Sussexand Norfolk, in which railway objectives have predominated. By night a fewbombs were dropped on three nights near Canterbury, in Lincolnshire and atHayling Island..Casualties.61.- The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hoursthe 9th are 3 killed and 7 seriously injured.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week: Italy.Turin. /:/^\;On the nights of the 28th/29th and 29th/30th November-(a) Widespread damage was caused to industrial and civil property.(b) About 12 aircraft dropped their bombs in the area of the Fiat Works atMirafiore. Considerable destruction was caused and the aero-engineassembly workshops suffered most.(c) Various works at present engaged entirely on work for Fiats (believed tobe numbering six) were also badly damaged and every step is beingtaken to reorganise them and the parent plant so far as possible.(d) Three large bombs hit the Lancia Works, causing severe damage.(e) The main administrative telephone offices were destroyed.   -(/) The railway station at Dora was hit again and that at Porta Suzaalso hit.(g) In the town, and especially towards the centre, damage was so heavy thatthe source found it impracticable to give details.Genoa. - &apos;In the attack on the night of the 15th/16th November the locomotive depotwas hit and 20 engines were damaged.General.The flight of the population from Milan continues on a large scale. Certainsmall industrial concerns have closed down and mo ved further south. Firms suchas Alfa Romeo and Isotta Fraschini are taking steps to divert at least some oftheir production to what they consider less vulnerableThe trade fair at Milan which was to be held in the third week of April 1943has been officially postponed.France. -   .Locomotive Attacks.In a recent declaration by the National Society of French Railways, one ofthe three reasons given for their failure to maintain the load of mineral trainswas the machine-gunning of locomotives. A number of these had been tempo-temporarily put out of use and congestion was caused in the repair shops. Thecircumstances were such that it would be impossible to comply with the demandsof the Germans that mineral train-loads should be maintained.Sea-mining.(i) The merchant ship Assistent was mined and sank in the Great Belt onthe 13th November.(ii) An unidentified vessel named the Dannevirke was mined and damagedon the 18th November in the Little Belt.(iii) The German steamer Duisburg was mined and sank on the19th November in Aalborg Bay.(iv) The Swedish vessel Urania of 628 tons was mined and sank on the23rd November at the North entrance to the Sound. .(v) The Swedish wireless on the 28th November announced that the three-masted schooner Thai had been blown up on the night the 27th /28th November inthe Western Baltic.(vi) The Swedish wireless on the 29th November stated that the motorsailing ship Maj had been damaged by a mine and that the vessel was sinking.No position was given.(vii) The Swedish wireless on the 2nd December reported that wreckagemarked Gustav had been washed up on the Swedish coast North of Malmo, andit appears that the vessel was mined on the Danish side of the Sound. The vesselin question is believed to be the Danish Gustav of 254 tons.
