The principalitems of damage reported are (i) The Fiat Works (Mirafiore).   A large workshop (360 x 155 yards)received two direct hits.    Three buildings in the transformer andswitching station were very seriously damaged.   The works railway station was partly destroyed and railway tracks and buildings to thef24783] &apos; &apos; B
 west of the works damaged. Damage was also caused to a numberof workmen&apos;s dwellings in the vicinity of the works, and sheds on the airfield at Mirafiore.(ii)^The Fiat Works (Corso Ferrucci). The roof lights of the main work-shop were blown out and the roofing of a large shed at the north endof the works destroyed.(iii) State Railway Workshops. A 13-bay building was hit and the roofof the main building damaged by blast.(iv) Among the public buildings damaged are the agricultural experimentalstation and the electrical institute. Residential, office and shopproperty was damaged in the western and south-western parts of thetown.A reliable source who was in Turin on the day after this attack reports thatgreat excitement and some demoralisation were evident at the Porto NuovoStation, from which crowds of women and children were waiting to leave.Raid of 20th/&apos;2\st November.A reliable source gives the following account of the second attack, on the night of the 20th/21st November. The attack was undoubtedly the heaviest sofar experienced in Italy. Most of the population lost their nerve and throughoutthe next day and night there was a panic evacuation from the city. Theauthorities could not restore order until the 23rd November. Damage to indusrty was heavy and a number of houses and shops were destroyed in the centre ofthe town. Casualties were high and the railway services, with few exceptions,were interrupted for a period of nearly 48 hours.Industrial damage included : (a) 8,000 ft. of roofing in the main block of workshops of the new Fiat works and I-! bays at the North-West corner of the works destroyed. Theadministrative buildings and several smaller workshops damaged.(b) 20 factories, including three other branches of Fiats, have been more orless heavily damaged, as well as many unidentified industrial buildings.(c) In the S.A. Mono-Service Italiana (Plastics) 23 bays, covering 1 acre,destroyed.(d) The Artillery Barracks in Corso Vittoria Emanuele II badly damaged by fire. Blast damage to a number of buildings of the Cavalry Barracksin the Corso Ferrucci. Prints 2-5 taken on the 24th November showsome of the damage.Raid of 28th/29th November.There is still no photographic cover for this raid.  A reliable source reports :&quot;The raid on Turin on the 28th/29th November caused exceptionaldamage. In the town, especially near the centre, damage is so heavy that itis impossible to give details. Practically all the principal firms in Northerntowns have evacuated their offices, thereby causing much confusion and inter-fering with production. At Milan the flight of the people continues on alarge scale. Some industrial concerns have closed down and moved further south.&quot; Indirect results of the raids have been a run on the banks to obtainliquid funds and heavy purchases of jewellery and other forms of easilytransferable assets. There has also been a sharp rise in the amount of fooddealt in on the Black Market, with consequent food shortage and rising prices.&apos;&apos; At the moment the interest of the North Italian people is to stop thewar.   Their one and only concern is to get away from the R.A.F.! &quot;Osnabrilck.Photographs taken on the 24th November show that the attack on the6th October caused widespread damage, mainly to industrial and railway plant.In the F. G. Hammersen A.G. (cotton yarn and weaving) four largeworkshops and two or three of the administrative buildings have been destroyedby fire.In the Osnabrucker Kupfer und Drahtwerk A.G. (Copper and wire works)an area of 180 feet x 90 feet of the main shop has been demolished. A reliable source reports that damage caused to these works in previous attacks -caused
40 per cent, less in production for some 2^ months, and full capacity had only been resumed shortly before this attack. He stated that the works are at presentalso producing submarine hull parts and armour plating.One workshop in Osnabrucker Presswerk (metal works), one in KlocknerWerke A.G. and two in Mollering A.G. (soap) have all been destroyed by fire,and four other small factories in various parts of the town have been damaged by fire or H.E.There is roof damage to the Guter und Rangier Bahnhof and to thetranshipment sheds at Tenterburg Eisenbahn Hauptwerkstatte.Amongst public buildings hit were the Municipal Slaughter House and theSewage Works. The barracks at Netterheide have been severely damaged, andthere is considerable.damage to residential property.Mining.The efficacy of recent sea mining in the southern part of the Bay of Biscayis illustrated by a report showing the decline that has occurred in the shipment of iron ore from Bilbao to the ports of Bayonne and Bordeaux. In August therewere 131 departures, in September only 55.&apos;A. H. M. S.December 17, 1942.[24783]
