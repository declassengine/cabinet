this document is the property of hisbritannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War&apos;Cabinet,  December 1942.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 594.December 18, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.CIVIL ADMINISTRATION AND SECURITY IN FRENCH NORTH and west AFRICA.; Memorandum by the Home Secretary;1. THE Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the&apos; Secret Session set at rest for&apos; the&apos;time being the doubts which existed&apos; in i Parliamentary circles as to the wisdom of doing ^business with Admiral Darlan. When the argument of military exigency^is no longer so pressing, we may expect a recrudescence of anxiety. Considera-tions of expediency carry great weight&apos;in war, but so also do those&apos; of ethics.2. Apart from&apos; our future attitude to&apos; Darlan indeed, whether or notDarlan remains there are so many persons of doubtful reliability in the areathat what worries me is the necessity fOr- -(a) the institution of adequate security arrangements in the French North!and West African territories in the interests of the Allies;:(b) the infiltration into (i) the civil administration, and)(ii) the French Armed Forces, particularly as they are&quot; asking&quot;us-fbFsupplies of arms and munitions,of reliable and competent persons, whether French, American ofBritish, not only to promote efficiency and to secure the adaptation ofthe French civil organisation to meet war time needs, but also toprevent sabotage against our Forces;(c) the elimination from both the civil administration and&apos; the French armed forces of unreliable elements; and(d) the organisation of a reasonably efficient civil administration, includingthe management of transport, the use of which is required for the prosecution of hostilities against the Axis.3. Are we yet satisfied that these elementary requirements have been met ?What has been done to impose proper censorship over communications bytelegraph, telephone, wireless and post? Is the frontier between French and spanish Morocco effectively controlled? Is the civil administration dependableand reasonably efficient to meet war-time conditions? Have people known to beunreliable been replaced by reliable men in all appropriate services? Have those officers and officials who supported the Allies before the Operation not only been released but also reinstated? Have the radio and the press in North.and WestAfrica been purged of doubtful elements; are- their policies in process of beingsuitably adapted to the needs of the Allies and the freedom of France ?4. There is little or no evidence that we can answer any of these questionssatisfactorily. Indeed, communications from His Majesty&apos;s Representativesabroad indicate the contrary. In the Annex will be found a few representativeextracts from them, which none of us can ignore and which must give all of usserio&apos;us concern.[24776]
25. I therefore read with great pleasure the Prime Ministers message to president Roosevelt setting out our concern on such matters. What the resultof that communication is, or will be, we do not yet know. Meantime, the reasonsfor anxiety continue.6. It may be argued that the Commander-in-Chief is an American Generalef eminence and ability, and that therefore we must be very restrained in insisting on our own point of view. This is a consideration we cannot ignore. account must be taken of it in whatever steps are decided upon. But the lives of theBritish Forces who form a considerable part of the Expedition may be imperilledas a consequence of negligence in the fields I have indicated. It seems to me,therefore, to be our duty, not only to ask, but if necessary to insist, that theBritish shall take their part as well as the Americans in the administrative and security matters to which I refer, in so far as they have not already been providedfor. Nor am I convinced that the Americans would resent friendly franknessin such matters of mutual concern.7. We have long experience of security problems and are not withoutcapacity in these matters. Among the Great Powers we hold a high place in the sphere of public administration and organisation. It would, I suggest, therefore,be a loss to the Allied war effort in North and West Africa if the qualifications and abilities of British subjects were not utilised to the fullest practicable extent.8. I understand that proposals are under consideration for the appointmentof an American and a British civilian of high authority to assist general eisenhower by relieving him of civilian and political responsibilites of the kindwith which I have dealt. This is all to the good. But it is necessary that theWar Cabinet should be satisfied that the arrangements adequately meet therequirements of a situation in which the Axis must be expected to promote trouble.9. Apart from this, however, I suggest that there should be set up a security Executive, subordinate to the Commander-in-Chief, presided over by aBritish person of suitable experience, representative of the American and british authorities, which would deal with all security questions, civil and military, intheir widest application. I feel sure we could find a suitable candidate forthe post.10. I hope my colleagues will forgive me for once more bringing thesematters before them, this time by way of a memorandum, but I feel it is my duty to raise them in the interests of that complete success for the Allied Forces whichall of us desire in North and West Africa.11. The attack on French North Africa started on the 7th/8th November.Some six weeks have passed without real progress towards the solution of an urgent problem of the utmost importance the establishment of an adequatewar-time civil administration with proper security arrangements.n. m.Home Office,December 18, 1942.
ANNEX.Algiers Telegram No. 4, dated December 9, 1942.Vice-Consul at Oran &quot; greatly disturbed that easy-going, far too tolerantand trusting attitude of United States military authorities is causing manyof our sympathisers to waver and fear for their own safety.&quot; Failure ofAmericans &quot; to suppress the propaganda activities of the &apos; Service d&apos;Ordrede Legion,&apos; a Fascist organisation with Gestapo proclivities, is being inter-preted as a sign of weakness and is encouraging the opposition.&quot; He is&quot;dissatisfied with security arrangements and fears that enemy agents of spanish and. Italian origin are active.&quot;Tangier Telegram No. 700, dated December 4, 1942,refers to &quot; failure of French (Rabat) authorities to jam Vichy broadcastsand present tone of French Rabat broadcasts (French attitude fence-sittingbetween Vichy and the Allies.&quot;)Tangier Telegram No. 703, dated December 71942,suggests that &quot; if arrangement with Darlan was necessary to secure quiet in french North Africa for disembarkation and transit of troops to Tunisiabattlefield and winning over French West Africa to the Allies, the americans should have taken precautions to control the French (German) administra-tion and their staffs who have been left in power. Strictest measures shouldhave been at once employed not only to disarm but to disperse the P.P.F.,S.O.L. and Legion, and all Gaullist and other political prisoners should havebeen released.....Zonal frontier should have been closed and a rigorouscensorship instituted in all post and telegraph offices and on radiobroadcasts.&quot;&apos;&apos; Certain Germanophile Spanish Consuls (notably the Spanish Consul at casablanca) are, I know, reporting fully by telephone and telegraph to theSpanish High Commissioner at Tetuan.&quot;Tangier Telegram No. 722, dated December 12, 1942.&quot;I have just received copy of a report which gives interesting detailsof the American Army and their relations with the French, together witha certain number of statistics and descriptions of the armoured vehicles destined for the Tunisian front. This report has been handed to the Spanishauthorities at Tetuan and. to the German Consul at Laraiche, who isSenor S.&apos;s intimate friend. The above provides excellent illustration ofwhat will be continually occurring unless the Americans take steps to close the frontier.&quot;Security Situation in French North Africa.Generally it gives cause for alarm, particularly in Casablanca and Rabat.There seems no doubt as to the unreliability of Nogues (or of the head of thePublic Security in Casablanca), who is releasing arrested suspects, giving suspectsvisas to enable them to cross into Spanish Morocco and reducing or transferringto the interior pro-Allied officials.
