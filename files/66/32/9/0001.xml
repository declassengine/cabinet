2I.-Effect of the Replacement of the Stirling, the Warwick andthe Wellington.1.   There are two questions to be considered : (A) The change-over from Stirling to Lancaster;(B) The change-over from Wellington to 4-engined bomber.2. (A) ^(i) Stirlings are at present manufactured at Shorts, Austins and short Harland in Belfast, together, of course, with many hundreds of sub-contractors. &quot;(ii) The change-over would take place in the following order : Shorts,Austins,(and possibly)   Short Harland.Note. It might perhaps be decided later to make the change atAustins first.(iii) If the necessary machine tools and jigs come forward as hoped, it isanticipated that the first Lancasters might be produced about March 1944.(iv) The loss in Stirling production would commence in the Autumn of 1943and the effect would be as follows (the figures throughout are cumulative) :: -Shorts.Up.to the end Up to the end&apos; Up to the endol 1943. of 1944.              of 1945.Stirlings        ..........            280 400               400Lancasters      ...       ...       ... .           ... 100                550Total       ...       ...       ... 280 500 950Net result compared .to fullStirling production        ... - 32 -124 + 14Austins,Stirlings        ...      ...      ... 360 562 562Lancasters     ...      ...... ... 50 540.Total      ...      ....... 360 612 1,102-   Net result compared to1 fullStirling production        ... - 12 -138 - 30Short Harland.Stirlings        ...      ...... 500 830 855Lancasters     ...&quot;     ...      ... ... .25 525Total      ......      ... .500 855 .   1,380Net result compared to fullStirling production ... ... -150 -130(v) The total result from the three factories would therefore be : ?Up to the end Up to the end Up to the endof 1943. 1 of 1944. of 1945.-44 -412 -146The foregoing estimates are based upon the current programme of the1st July, 1942, which was, admittedly, optimistic and has now been set back by six months. They are, however, the only figures available at the present time, but should be treated with reserve. To gauge in proper perspective the loss due to thechange up to the end of 1944 (412 on an optimistic estimate) it should be con-sidered in relation to the probable cumulative output to the end of 1944(approximately 11,000).(B) (i) Wellingtons are at present manufactured at Vickers, Weybridge,Vickers, Chester,Vickers, Blackpool,and many hundreds of sub-contractors.
(ii) The Blackpool factory would be kept on Wellingtons which will berequired to the extent of the capacity of that factory.(iii) The change-over would take place at Weybridge first and then atChester. Assuming that the prototype is cleared in September 1943, productionof the Lancaster could start in January/April 1945. The B. 3/42. would be-6 months later.(iv) If the change-over were to be to Lancasters the following are the antici-pated programmes on the assumption that no special delay is created by thedifferent type of construction, no&quot; bugs &quot; are found in the new-type Lancaster,and that the machine tools are available :-Weybridge.

The larger loss up to the end of 1945 in the case of tlhe introduction of theLancaster is due to the fact that it conies into production before the B. 3/42. Theultimate loss which would result from the introduction of either type would bethe same.3. The two change-overs to Lancaster at Shorts and Vickers cannot takeplace contemporaneously owing to the position as to machine tools. The speciallarge machine tools required for Lancasters are at present 11 short; 12 more willbe required for the change-over (1) and 18 will be required for change-over (2).The best estimated delivery attainable is 12 within 9 months. Deliveries ofadditional numbers of these special tools (piano-millers) could continue at therate of 4 per month.4. It must be borne in mind that Lancaster production is contemporaneouslybeing developed in Canada.5. The comparison between the new-type Lancaster and the B. 3/42 is inthe attached paper.6. The following considerations must be borne in mind in arriving at adecision:-(a) The new-type Lancaster is not yet proved, but is likely to have less bugsthan the wholly new B. 3/42.(b) In the change-over figures no allowance has been made for the fact thatit will mean introducing a new, and to the workers- strange, typeof construction at Vickers.(c) The man-hours for the two types of plane are probably much about thesame.(d) There is no likelihood of any further large improvement in the Lancaster.i.e., heavier and more powerful engines. This will be possible withthe B. 3/42 within the extra 5,000 lbs. take-off weight that it will give.(e) If&quot; the Stirling change-over to Lancasters is decided it would not bepossible contemporaneously to change over Wellington to Lancaster.(/) The new type Lancaster performances are not certain and tested but are probably more certain of realisation than those of the B. 3/42.(g) We are to receive 287 Liberators (as a firm commitment) from UnitedStates in 1943 (in addition to 111 counted against an attrition fequire-ment). In view of the many probable demands for Liberators, e.g.,,from Coastal Command, we are not guaranteed against loss fromchange-over of Stirling production.II. Comparison of the $ new type Lancaster and the B. 3/42.1. The new type Lancaster does not yet exist but the following mainmodifications are assumed for the purpose of comparison :-20-mm. armament as for B. 3/42,New armour and tank protection against 20-mm.Improved engine cooling system, radiators in wing ducts.Clean up nose of fuselage so as to give less air resistance.2. When a new aircraft of this class is designed and put into productiona safety factor of not less than 5 is insisted upon. As experience of the planeis acquired in actual use this factor is allowed to fall to 4-5.3. The initial form of B. 3/42 will, therefore, have a factor of 5, but thenew type Lancaster will have the factor of 4-5 which is that in the presentLancaster.4. This means that the new B. 3/42 would be capable of having its loadincreased, whereas the new type Lancaster would not.5. The proper comparison to make is, therefore, between the two planesat a factor of 4-5 for each, though this factor would not be reached in the initial stages by the B. 3/42.
6. Four lines of figures are, therefore, given below, first the presentLancaster, second the new type Lancaster, third the B. 3/42 as initially produced,fourth the B. 3/42 as finally made with factor 4-5.1.
