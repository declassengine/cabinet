THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT----------------     ,j r- nPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942. ^       1 &quot; 1   /&quot;SECRET. Copy No    24W.P. (42) 610.December 22, 1942.WAR CABINET.INDIA.INDIAN STATES: REQUEST BY CHAMBER OF PRINCES FOR ASTATEMENT OF POLICY BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate herewith (as Annexure A) a copy of the telegrams which I sent tothe Viceroy in pursuance of the decision of the War Cabinet at their meeting onthe 6th October (W.M. (42) 132nd Conclusions, Minute 2), and a copy of the reply which I have now received from him (Annexure B). The terms of the draft reply which he now proposes are, in my view, suitable and I would propose, if the WarCabinet approve, to authorise the issue of the letter forthwith. In view of therecent public asseveration, the text of which is appended (Annexure C), of thetreaty -rights of the. Princes in the question asked and the reply which I made inthe House of Commons on the 3rd December, I submit that publication of the replyto the Chancellor is no longer required; and I share the Viceroy&apos;s view that, inpresent circumstances, it would be undesirable.L. S. A.India Office,December 22, 1942.ANNEXURE A.Telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Crown Representative, . .dated October 7, 1942.17470.Your telegram of the 25th August, 2591-P. Draft reply to Jam Sahib hasbeen discussed by War Cabinet whose view is that since the terms of any replymade are likely to become known (vide end of paragraph 5 of your telegram)it would be better that the reply should be given publicly. They consider thatthe objections to making the reply public would not apply to a short simplestatement which in their view should follow the lines of the draft containedin my immediately succeeding telegram.2. The draft is in the form of a letter from your Political Adviser to theChancellor wdiich could be communicated by one or other to the Press. It doesnot refer specifically to the Jam Sahib&apos;s letter (which was marked secret) butgenerally to representations made by the Princes. The Prime Minister asks meto say that he would welcome any criticisms that you may have to offer on the wording before he finally approves the draft.3. I think it would be helpful to the Prime Minister to have your viewsalso on the following points which occur to me in this connexion : (i) Would you apprehend any unfavourable reactions from British Indianparties if such a statement were published, seeing that none of them has received a similar clarification or explanation. of the draft declaration subsequent to the Cripps Mission ?[24800]&apos; b
2(ii) You and I are, I think, in general agreement that nothing should bedone to cause the Princes to relax their efforts to set their houses inorder and prepare in this way for whatever the future may hold.Do you think a published statement on the above lines would encourage them in any way to sit back and rely on His Majesty&apos;s Government^support rather than on their own efforts ?(iii) We.cannot afford to be pushed into a discussion as to how we intend tocarry out our treaty obligations. Is there more risk of embarrassingpressure of this kind arising from a short published statement on thelines indicated than from the procedure proposed in your telegram ?(iv) Would you consider it advisable in so far as the proposed statement doesnot cover all the points raised by the Jam Sahib to supplement it bya confidential letter dealing with the remaining points on the linesdiscussed between us ?Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Crown Representative, dated october 7, 1942.17471.Following is draft referred to : &quot; I am desired by His Excellency the Crown Representative to write to your highness on the subject of certain anxieties which are understood to be enter-tained by the Order of Princes on the subject of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards the Indian States in pursuance of their policy in relation tothe realisation of self-government in India which  they authorised Sir stafford cripps to discuss with representatives of the Indian Rulers as well as with british Indian leaders. [To Hyderabad only : The representation submitted by you on behalf of the Hyderabad Government on a particular aspect of the matter has been duly forwarded to His Majesty&apos;s Government.]&quot;2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken note of the terms of your highness&apos;s letter of 10th April to Sir Stafford Cripps communicating the viewsof the Indian States on the proposal and of the Resolution passed by the Chamberof Princes to which it referred. They have authorised His Excellency the crown representative to inform Your Highness, with reference to paragraph (b) of theResolution of the Chamber, that they adhere to their obligations, by Treaty orotherwise, towards the States. They see no reason to define their conception ofthese obligations. The statement by the Lord Privy Seal in the House of commons on 28th April, 1942, is in no way inconsistent with them.&quot;3. . An assurance was asked for in Your Highness&apos;s letter of 10th Aprilthat, in the event of a number of States not finding it feasible to adhere to a constitution devised for India as a whole, the non-adhering States or groups of states so desiring should have a right to form a union of their own. I amauthorised to say that the fact that no explicit provision was contained in thedraft declaration for the formation of any union of non-adhering States or groups of States is not to be taken as constituting any discrimination to the disadvantage of the States as compared with the Provinces of British India. Thedraft declaration contains a provision on this matter in regard to non-accedingProvinces, but not in regard to non-adhering States, because the responsibility which His Majesty&apos;s Government have exercised for many years for the govern-ment of the Provinces of British India finds no parallel within the territories of the Rulers of Indian States.&quot;ANNEXURE B.Telegram from the Crown Representative to Secretary of State for India,dated December 14, 1942.3499-P.I have very carefully considered your important telegram of 7th October17470 and points therein raised by War Cabinet as also their alternative draft reply to Jam Sahib&apos;s secret letter of 1st June.2. I fully appreciate force of arguments used by Cabinet and by yourself.But in the outcome and. after mature reflection I would myself favour a somewhat different approach. I discuss below : (a) general line which I think should most
wisely be taken, (b) important issue of publicity raised by the Cabinet, (c)important and delicate general question of a States Union. I deal with these points seriatim.3. As regards the general line to be taken I have given fullest weight to thearguments mentioned by you, but in result would still strongly urge that we shouldnot go beyond the general line proposed in my telegram of 25th August.4. No doubt owing to its brevity draft proposed by Cabinet would seem tome: (a) to be too sweeping, particularly in regard to reaffirmation. Thus thewords &apos;&apos; or otherwise&apos;&apos; in para. 2 would be interpreted by the Princes asapplicable to numerous &apos;&apos; rights &apos;&apos; which by reason of their origin or naturedeserve no such sanctity; (&amp;) the reference in para. 2 to Stafford Cripps&apos;s speech in&quot; my judgment would merely puzzle rather than reassure the Princes unlessamplified on the lines of para. 4 of my own draft; (c) I attach the greatest importance to qualifying reaffirmation by a caveat, as in para. 3 of my draft.5. On this last point, I see no reason why such a caveat should offend ordiscourage any Prince whose opinion deserves respect, particularly if publicationis not to take place without the consent of the Chancellor, if in effect it merelyconveys an endorsement by His Majesty&apos;s Government of advice.which I have repeatedly given in public to Chamber. I believe that this would be welcomedrather than resented by those more important Princes who realise the dangers which conditions in many small States involve for the whole Princely order.Following quotation from covering letter from the Committee of Ministersappointed to examine questions &quot;arising out of Cripps&apos;s Mission &quot; presentingtheir report to the Chancellor lends, I suggest, strong support to this proposition :Begins: &quot;Many of the units that constitute Indian India are too small to maintainefficient administration. Recent events clearly demonstrate that unless suitableaction in respect of joint services is taken immediately by Rulers of these Statesthere is grave danger to their sovereign position. The continuance of presentposition of system of individual independence conditioned by Paramountcy is nota future we can face with equanimity.&quot; Ends. (Jam Sahib is not aware that Ihave seen this letter and above quotation is for information of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment only.)6. As regards publicity I have given full weight to your arguments. ButI am strongly opposed to publicity either here or at home. It would have allthe disadvantages, in jriy opinion, indicated in paragraph No. 3 of your telegramof 7th October. Apart from that, while I appreciate that Cabinet may feel thatwe are giving assurances, &amp;c, in a private letter, which are of general interest,I do not regard that argument as convincing, for our case is substantially thatwe are reassuring Princes as to position of assurances already given, while muchof remainder of any letter would be devoted to removing unimportant miscon-exceptions. The criticisms which we have to answer have been put to us in letterof 1st June which was secret and clearly not intended to be published, at any ratenof at this stage. Its publication and that of our reply would certainly not helpatmosphere in British India and might, I think, well expose His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to some Parliamentary difficulty, though I not not. exaggerateimportance of that. Finally, while Princes would no doubt welcome publicity forreaffirmation of treaty obligations they might feel differently in regard to caveat,.by which I think it essential to qualify that reaffirmation. I realise thatJam Sahib himself has given wide publicity to content, of his letter in his recentaddress to East India Association, but that does not affect my views.7. One other issue of great importance remains. I am conscious that itmight be politically difficult to explain or defend the refusal to States of principleconceded to autonomous Provinces of British India, and the right to formseparate Unions in the event of an All-India Union being Unacceptable, sincesuch refusal would in effect rob the States of a bargaining counter equivalent tothat in the hands of predominantly dissident Provinces. On the other hand, themore I reflect on the question the more I am convinced of practical difficultiesin any such development if we ever seriously contemplated it as something to becarried into effect. In that connection paragraph No. 3 of Cabinet draft might,in my opinion, seriously mislead the Princes and raise unjustifiable expectationsunless qualified by a warning that recognition of any such, union must inevitablyand drastically affect the nature of their present exclusive relationship with theCrown.8.   In all these circumstances I adhere to the general line of reply suggestedin my telegram of 25th August, though, as you will see from revised? draft&apos;    [24800] -    &apos; ;b 2
contained in my immediately succeeding telegram, I have altered it in certain respects. I trust that the Cabinet, in the light of explanations now given, will feel able to accept it.9. Let me add only that while you will see I have been at pains to considerthe feelings and attitude of the Princes in revised draft I very strongly recom-mend, as Cabinet approve, that you should give the Jam Sahib a pretty straighttalk, simultaneously with issue of our letter to him, on shortcomings in the States,the necessity for combined administrations, elimination of weaker brethren, &amp;c.In the course of any such discussions it might be possible to add that HisMajesty&apos;s Government, so as to avoid any public embarrassment to the States,had refrained from a public statement in these terms, but that they were alsoinstructing me, as His Excellency the Crown Representative, to draw pointedattention, though in a friendly manner, to various references to this subject which I have made during my Viceroyalty and to urgent necessity for quickeningthe pace, either at any meeting of the Chamber that might take place before Ihand over next October, or, if there is not such a meeting, in a letter to theChancellor which might at a later stage be published.Telegram from the Crown Representative to Secretary of State for India, datedDecember 14, 1942.(Important.)3500-P.My immediately preceding telegram. Following is text of draft letter from my Political Secretary to pro-Chancellor in reply to Jam Sahib&apos;s letter dated 1st June :.- &quot;1. Necessary discussions with His Majesty&apos;s Government have inevitablydelayed the sending of a reply to His Highness the Chancellors important secretletter dated 1st June, 1942, in which he brought to notice misgivings aroused in the minds of,the Princes in connection with the mission of Sir Stafford Cripps toIndia, and asked for reassurances on certain points. In His Highness&apos;s absence from India I have been desired by His Excellency the Crown Representative to address Your Highness regarding these matters and to make it clear at the outset that the terms of this letter have been expressly authorised by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.&quot;2. In Part I of his letter His Highness recapitulated the assurances given from time to time to the Princes in regard to the inviolability of their treaties and engagements, and desired an authoritative statement which would remove the impressions created by the phraseology of, the draft declaration which sir Stafford Cripps brought to India. In reply I am to say that the IndianPrinces may rest assured that the. fulfilment of the fundamental obligationsarising out of their Treaties and Sanads remains an integral part of HisMajesty&apos;s Government^ policy and that the absence of specific mention thereof inthe draft declaration has no significance. In accordance with that policy such reference to those obligations was made by the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons in announcing officially the purpose of Sir Stafford&apos;s mission. nor does there appear to be any good ground for alarm at the reference in thedeclaration to the necessity for a certain degree of treaty-revision. The use ofthe word &apos; negotiate &apos; implied that no unilateral denunciation was intended,and Sir Stafford was. at pains to make it clear to the Princes that the treaties ofnon-adhering States would not be revised without their consent. Still less is there any foundation for the suggestion that the Crown no long attaches value to the loyal services and assistance of the States. Shortly after His Highness the chancellors letter was (? written), His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucesterbrought to India a personal message of greeting in which His Majesty made agracious reference to the unstinting loyalty and co-operation which the Princes,&apos; true to their tradition,&apos; were so signally displaying.&quot;3. His Excellency the Crown Representative is confident that what has been said above should remove the misgiving which His Highness the chancellor has so frankly brought to notice. He is equally confident that he and his successors may expect the Princes, who naturally look for support to the Crownwhich he represents, to strive in their own best interests after comformity with world opinion in regard to administrative standards as developed since relationswith them were established. The interpretation of the letter of the relevanttreaties, as your Highness is aware, has long been affected by usage and sufferanceand must become increasingly related to the manner in which the States adapt
themselves to the necessities of changing times, more particularly in the matterof the pooling of powers and resources for the purpose of raising the quality and stability of their public services.&quot;4. In part II of his letter His Highness the Chancellor refers to the grave concern caused by a statement made in Parliament by Sir Stafford Cripps after his return from India. In that connection I need hardly remind Your Highness of theview to which the Crown Representative himself has given public expression (andwhich is fully endorsed by His Majesty&apos;s Government not so much in their own interest as in that of the Princes themselves) that effective machinery should beestablished in all States whereby the legitimate wants and grievances of theirsubjects can be brought to notice. But it is for the said Rulers themselves to devise what precise form of machinery is best suited to achieve that object, andthere is nothing in the speech to which His Highness the Chancellor has referredto indicate a change of policy in regard to abstention from the imposition upon theStates of Constitutional reforms.&quot;5. Part III of the Chancellor&apos;s letter refers to certain miscellaneous matterssome of which no longer call for reply. Point (/), for instance, has been fullymet by His Highness&apos;s own appointment to the War Cabinet in London, andpoint (b) has already been dealt with above. In regard to point (a), however,I am to point out that, so long as fundamental responsibilities for the armed forcesremain in the hands of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, the interests ofthe Indian States are unaffected. In the absence of any intention to depart fromthat position Sir Stafford Cripps considered it unnecessary to consult the states delegation in regard to the defence formula. Similarly, in regard to point (d),I am to say that, under the draft declaration, the adherence of a State to any newUnion was for the discretion of that. State. It would thus have been open to itto endeavour to negotiate terms which would set at rest the apprehensions which appear to have prompted this observation. As regards point (e), a Constitution-making body could hardly be debarred from interesting itself in the internal affairs of prospective adhering units in so far as related to the machinerywhereby the Union Government would function. Nor would it in any case be easy to lay down in advance the precise procedure which such a body would adopt.But, since its essential function would be to frame a workable constitution, itwould be open to representatives of the States to protest against any discussionsoutside that limit or to refuse to participate in them.&quot; 6. Part IV of the Chancellors letter briefly reviews the claim of the Princesthat in the event of a number of States not finding it feasible to adhere to a constitution devised for India as a whole, such non-adhering States &quot; should be afforded the option of having a Union of their own with full sovereign status.&quot;In so far as His Highness has interpreted the absence of any such provision fromthe draft declaration as doing less than justice to the right of the States to expect treatment not less favourable than that accorded to Provinces, I am toexplain that there was never any intention of such adverse discrimination. Onthe contrary, the reason for it is to be found, in the fact that the direct responsibility exercised by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to theadministration of British India finds no parallel within the territories of the princes. I would only add that His Highness will appreciate that this matter has not been worked out in close detail and that the practical considerations and difficulties involved will be only too present to you. Nor should it be overlookedthat the recognition of any such union, as is referred to by the Chancellor, mustfundamentally affect, the nature of the present exclusive relationship of theindividual States with the Crown. The draft declaration which was in very general terms proved abortive for reasons with which Your Highness isfamiliar, and though the main principles of that offer stand, the form and natureof their application is a matter for the future.&quot; 7. In conclusion I am to inform Your Highness that arrangements havebeen made for a copy of this letter to be supplied to His Highness the Chancellorby the India Office simultaneously with its issue to yourself.&quot;ANNEXURE C.Question No. 26 (December 3, 1942).Mr. A stor: To ask the Secretary of State for India whether the offer of thepresent Minister of Aircraft Production took&quot; full notice of the treaties betweenthe Crown and the Princes of India; whether these treaties remain valid in their
integrity; and whether he will undertake that they will not be changed by anyconstitution-making body without the assent of the parties concerned ?A answer.Mr. Amery: The honourable Member is no doubt. referring to the various.Treaties, Engagements and Sanads defining the relations of the Crown withRulers of Indian States. The interpretation of the original terms of certain ofthese engagements has, as is well known, been affected over a long period byusage and sufferance; but, subject to that qualification, the answer to all threeparts of his question is in the affirmative.Mr. Astor: Thank you very much.Mr. Granville: Does that answer indivate that there has been any change inthe offer which was made by the late Lord Privy Seal ?Mr. Amery: No, Sir.
