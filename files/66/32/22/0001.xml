GOVERNMENT BUILDING PROGRAMME.Memorandum by Minister of &quot;Works and Planning.1.      The present known Government Building Programme requiresan expenditure of about  220 millions betv/een 1st December 1942and 30th June 1943 of which Service and Supply Departments areresponsible for  190 mils.    The total is made up as follows:-Air Ministry 113 mils.Bolero (other than 30    &quot;Air Ministry)Other approved works of Super-Preferenceor &apos;A&apos; priority&quot;(including civil departments) 75    &quot; 220 mils.2.      The total labour force now employed on the above work isestimated at 310,000 men,  and the number of unfilled vacanciesis 44?000:  on Super-preference Jobs alone the number is 33s000of whom 25,000 could be absorbed immediately.    Since the intensive recruitment for the special programme bv-gan in june the cumulative total of placings on these,works is over 180,000.This figure,  of course,  includes -men placed more than once.&apos;The 310,000 men are distributed as follows:-Air Ministry 110,000Bolero (other than 68,000Air Ministry)Other Super-Preferenceand fA&apos;  works 132,000 310,000Further,  since the Bolero programme did not start as early&apos;in the building season as was intended, and since allowance hasnow to be made for a reduction of the building labour force by225,000 between July 1942 and December 1943?  the total labour available will in the immediate future be short of the amount required for the above programme by about 115?000 men, made upas follows:-

Air Ministry 42,000    -Bolero (other than 45,000Air Ministry)Other Super-Prefereneeand &apos;A&apos;  works 2.8,000 115,000In order to relate the Building programme  to the available&apos;abour supply,  the following proposals are submitted foronsideration: -(a) An immediate cut,  or postponement, tothe extent of 15% of the value of the;works now in hand.I   -   (b) A reduction in the rate of starting new works by all Departments to a totalweekly amount of  1.5 . millions for.aperiod of four months.I.     This calls for the immediate re-examination of thefro grammes of all Departments with a view to cuts being effected which,  over the whole field, will produce a reduction!-n the labour demand of 30 per cent.
