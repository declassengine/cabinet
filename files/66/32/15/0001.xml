THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT63Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.SECRET.Copy No. 39W.P. (42) 585.December 15, 1942.//WAR CABINET.ITALIAN MORALE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a report prepared by the Departmentsconcerned, including the Service Departments, on the morale of the Italian army,navy and air force.THE state of Italian morale was last considered in mid-October.*Developments since Italy&apos;s entry into the war were then reviewed and theconclusion reached was that, although the war was intensely unpopular andMussolini was fast losing his prestige, there was no organised opposition party or leaders and the predominant characteristic of the Italian people was apathy.A few strikes and food riots had occurred and the Black Market was flourishing,but there was no sign of any organised resistance, either among the civilian population or in the army. Nor was there much prospect of active oppositionto the regime so long as the Party, supported if it became necessary by german troops, remained strong enough to deal with any potential leader who mightemerge.2. It was suggested in the previous paper that if living conditionsdeteriorated, if Italy suffered severe reverses in Africa and if Italian targets were subjected to widespread, and continuous bombing, unrest might reachdangerous dimensions.3. In the interval military developments directly affecting the position ofItaly have taken place. There have been the defeat of the Italian and german armies in Africa, the Anglo-American landings in North Africa which bringthe war close to Italy&apos;s shores, and increasingly heavy raids on the principal,towns in North Italy. The raids on Genoa and Turin have caused great materialdestruction, and large-scale evacuation from these towns and from Milan is in.progress. At Genoa the organisation of food supplies and medical services is.,known to have broken down, and the commercial life of the city is believed to-have been seriously interrupted. While the Italians in the cities bombed haveshown a tendency to panic, there is no detailed evidence as to the effect which,the bombing of Genoa, Turin and Milan has produced in districts, other thanthose attacked. The difficulties attendant on evacuation, however (of which the^problem of food distribution appears at present the most serious) have alreadybeen felt over a wide area, and the effects on industrial output must have been considerable. There is evidence that general dissatisfaction, resulting in someanti-Fascist demonstrations, has been caused by the inadequate defences andA.R.P. measures organised by the Italian Government.

2against Great Britain has been reported but this, though exploited by Fascistpropaganda, does not appear to have reached serious proportions.4. Preliminary reports indicate that, as might be expected, militarydevelopments in North Africa and the heavy raids on North Italy have seriously affected Italian morale. They make it clear that many existing tendencies havebeen accentuated : war weariness has increased and the desire for peace isstronger than ever; the regime grows less and less popular and hatred of theGermans has become intense. What the reports do not show is whether there areunderground organisations with sufficient strength and following to mobilisefeeling against the regime. There are, however, indications that such smallorganisations as exist are showing greater strength of purpose and morewillingness to work with one another.5. In spite of discordance within the Party, the Fascist hierarchy as awhole still seem to be convinced that they are committed to a German victory andthat they must sink or swim together. There has been no change in the positionof the King, who continues to be regarded as a tool of the regime. The crown prince has no policy apart from that of the Party and it has been suggested thathe might be used as a man of straw by the Germans to take over the leadership of the country if Mussolini, about whose ill-health there have been persistentrumours, were forced to retire. Neither the Crown Prince however, nor anyother leader in the Fascist Party, would command anything like the followingor powers now held by Mussolini. The small clergy are reported to be stronglyanti-Fascist, but in higher places there is still a willingness to compromise withthe regime and the mass of the people does not look to the Church for a leadtowards a way out of their present difficulties. It should be borne in mind that several hundred thousand Italians are hostages in the hands of the Germans(workers in Germany as well as troops on the war fronts), and that Italian familyties are very strong. The fear of reprisals on relatives would be a deterrent to action against the regime which would obviously lead to trouble with Germany.6. There is at present no reliable indication of any lowering of the Italiannaval morale as a consequence of the events in North Africa and the recent and heavy bombing of Italian cities. At the same time it is true to state that the collective morale of the Fleet is inferior to the individual. It is this collectivemorale that has led on occasion to the &quot; evasions &quot; by Italian warships coupled,perhaps, with the reluctance of the Italian Higher Command to risk a fleet onwhich so much money has been lavished and of which such high hopes have beenentertained.It is likely that recent air raids on Italian targets, coupled with our navalsuccesses in the Mediterranean, may tend to impair the morale of the Italiannavy &quot;and mercantile marine. Nevertheless, that morale in the Italian mercantilemarine is.not yet at breaking point is shown by the fact that crews can still befound for ships proceeding to North Africa.7. Italian Air Force morale is shown by previous experience to be liable to fall rapidly under defensive conditions. Morale was hitherto at its highestamong fighter and torpedo-bomber pilots. The former have suffered from the strain of operating intensively, in the forward area on the Egyptian Front,against an Allied Air Strength overwhelmingly superior to the combined Axisforces. In the central Mediterranean, for the first time, the torpedo-bomber pilotsare having to undertake operations daily over a prolonged period and have incurred heavy losses in aircraft and leading crews. These losses will undoubtedlyaffect the spirit of torpedo-bomber crews which represent the pick of the ItalianAir Force. Events on the home front and the realisation that the fighterdefences of Metropolitan Italy have been neglected cannot improve the spirit of italian Air Force personnel serving overseas.8. The -Army is likely to have been more nearly affected by recent militaryevents, and to be more sensitive to internal political developments, than the other two fighting services. There has not yet been time to judge the effect on thearmy of the reverses in North Africa. It is safe to say that relations with theGermans, which were already strained, have deteriorated, and there is reason tobelieve that the army is as weary of the war as the bulk of the civilian population.There is again definite hostility between the army and the Fascist Militia. On theother hand, the army would probably put up a better fight in defence of the home-land than it has in defence of the African colonies, and it is completely loyal to
the House of Savoy and would be most unlikely to take any action against theCrown. Should there be a rift between the Crown and the Party, the army wouldprobably play a prominent role in establishing a new Government. Alternatively,in the event of the internal situation becoming really serious, the army might forceaction upon the King, which would lead to a removal of his support from the fascist regime.9. There does not seem to be any immediate prospect of overtures for aseparate peace being put forward, widespread though the desire for such a moveis believed to be, and though the possibility should not be absolutely excluded ofthe Italians refusing to continue the fight and being forced to sue for peace as aresult of continuous bombing and other action. What was left of Mussolini&apos;sprestige has practically vanished, but no alternative leader has emerged, and thestrength of the Party, though undoubtedly weakened, has not been broken. Itmay be expected that the Germans will progressively find it more difficult to spareenough troops to deal with widespread unrest in Italy, ,but they have not relaxedtheir indirect hold over the country and it is inconceivable that they wouldacquiesce without a struggle in the replacement of Mussolini by a peace party.10. Although the prerequisites essential to the rise of a party willing and able to negotiate a separate peace may not exist, this does not rule out thepossibility of a breakdown of the internal administrative machinery and anepidemic of serious rioting in individual areas. Such a state of affairs might eventually be developed into organised resistance against the regime, even withoutthe prior appearance of a national leader and in spite of the presence of german troops in Italy.11.   To sum up : (i) The morale of the Italian people has sunk very low. There have been nolarge-scale disorders, and so long as fear of repression is stronger than fear ofthe Royal Air Force and of the extension of military operations to Italy, it is unlikely that the people will be ripe for seditious movements.(ii) The Fascist Party is still sufficiently powerful, and the German gripremains strong enough, to prevent at present the development of conditions underwhich a separate peace could be negotiated.(iii) The House of Savoy, though a potential rallying-point, is at presentunable or unwilling to take the lead against the Fascist Government and in theabsence of a move by the army the lead would have to come from undergroundorganisations.   The evidence as to the strength of such organisations is meagre.(iv) A general collapse of the internal administration of the country is apractical possibility if military reverses and heavy bombing of Italian targetscontinue.(Signed) V.
