December 1942.SECRET.W.P, m) 586,December 21, 1942.Copy No.WAR CABINET.UNITED STATES ELECTION RESULTS, 1942,Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for Foreign Affairs.I think that my colleagues may be interested to see the annexed paperprepared by the North American Department of the Foreign Office on the recentelections in the United States of America.2. Certain recommendations as to the part that we should pursue in thelight of the result of the elections are made in.the three concluding paragraphs.I would draw my colleagues&apos; special attention to the advice in paragraph 6 thatwe should take advantage of the next two years, and particularly of 1943, to conclude with an Administration which is exceptionally anxious to collaborate with us agreements as may seem necessary, which reach into the post-war period and will engage American responsibilities outside the Western Hemisphere..A. E.Foreign Office, December 21, 1942.ANNEX.United States Election Results, 1942.A telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington analysing theresults of the Congressional Elections held in the United States on the4th November shows that the final figures are as follows:- Old (77th) Congress.House-rr-.Democrats :..Republicans ...Independents ...Vacant _____Senate DemocratsRepublicansIndependents257165674356628296New (78th) Congress.House-Democrats. &apos;   .....RepublicansProgressives   ...American LabourFarmers&apos; LabourSenate DemocratsRepublicansIndependents&apos;2212111.11435573819611927   [24765]
22.   Lord Halifax&apos;s telegram makes the following points : A. As regard&apos;s the voting : (i) The election took place in an atmosphere unfavourable to theAdministration in respect of (a) the trend of the war news;(b) the apparent conduct of the war at home and overseas.(ii) There was no great national issue, and the Presidency was not at stake.(iii) The poll was therefore very light, a fact which favoured Republicancandidates.(iv) In many crucial contests local issues and the local party machinesgreatly influenced the voting,(v) For various reasons (paragraphs 3, 4, 5 of the telegram) theAdministration lost the mass support of organised Labour, the farmers and the &quot; forgotten man &quot; ail of whom had been propsof the New Deal at previous elections.B. As regards the new Congress :  (i) Both parties show a split, viz. : Democrats, split on internal policy,i.e., New Dealers versus Conservatives, mostly Southerners.Republicans, split on foreign policy, i.e., Luce and Willkie versusJoseph Martin and the national party organisation.(ii) The Conservative Southern&apos; Democrats will hold the balance of power in the new Congress, which meets in January. They mostlyhave hitherto been interventionist and pro-Roosevelt, but thereare isolationists and anti-New Dealers among them notablySenator Wheeler.(iii) The new Congress as a whole will assert itself, vis-a-vis theAdministration, in home affairs, the conduct of the war, andforeign affairs. In particular, it seems hostile to Labour and to&quot;planning,&quot; whether at home or abroad. New Dealers in theAdministration are alarmed but uncompromising. The Presidentis likely to compromise, as usual.C. As regards the future (i) Isolationism was not an issue and all attempts to make it one failed.Most  prominent  isolationists  were  re-elected  and  Willkie&apos;sinfluence in Congress has not increased; but(ii) There is no discernible revival of Isolationism; indeed(iii) No national trend at all has appeared; therefore. -   (iv) We ourselves can greatly influence the outcome.D. No change in our policy is recommended by Lord Halifax.3. This general analysis differs in no material respect from those of experienced observers, such as Professor D. W. Brogan and the Washingtoncorrespondent of The Times, Sir W. Lewis. Both of these are, however, moreoutspokenly pessimistic as regards the Republican party, whose record, indeed, is anything but reassuring. Sir W. Lewis categorically states that it will not bepossible to establish in war-time a &quot;co-operative international relationshipwhose extension into the time of relief and reconstruction could not be prevented by later Congressional action.&quot;4. On the question : &quot; Is a repetition of the tragedy of 1919 likely ? &quot; lord halifax points out (i) that President Roosevelt is a more skilful politician than.PresidentWilson, but speaks with less moral authority;(ii) that no present Isolationist has the stature of Borah or Lodge; but thatSenator Wheeler&apos;s parliamentary skill and personal popularity are tobe reckoned with;(iii) that &quot;both Isolation and the League of Nations appear to have failed,&quot;but that the American people will not necessarily draw the rightconclusion.5. Lord Halifax does not recommend any change of policy on our part. Weshould therefore continue to avoid saying and doing things which experience shows will irritate American opinion; and, where we must say or do such
things, we must take care that they are properly presented. In particular, weshould carefully abstain from unnnecessary criticism or belittling of Mr. Willkie,who is fundamentally friendly, and to whom we owe much, at a time when it is so much to our interest that he should gain the greatest practicable measure of influence over his present party. (He was a Democrat -until 1938, and it is not impossible that he will want to revert to that party.) On the positive side wemust press on, at every opportunity, with our endeavours to demonstrate tothe world, and to the United States in especial, that we are a great, living and liberal association of peoples and races, in constant evolution and fruitfulin ideas. Above all, we must prove by action our will and capacity for leader-ship. The fact that the elections have shown a reassertion of the conservativeside of the American character should not lead us to, believe that theUnited States do not and will not insist on the British Empire beingliberal. In terms of our major Allies this will mean that we should showourselves sympathetic to China, but that we should be cautions about ourselvesplaying up Russia in the United. States (Mr. Willkie is, in fact, playing upboth Russia and China as part of his anti-Isolationist educational campaign).The fact that it is essentially liberal is the sole possible justification of theEmpire in American eyes and an indispensable condition upon which long-termco-operation with it and in its defence might be acceptable. America&apos;senlightened self-interest even after recent lessons will not by itself be sufficient.It is by showing ourselves in a progressive and self-confident light that we can best exert that influence upon the eventual crystallisation of American thought to which Lord Halifax rightly attaches importance at this juncture.6. Also we ought to take full advantage of the next two years, andespecially of the coming year, to push on with any agreements, political, economic or commercial, that we desire to make with the United States Government. Ina remarkable degree the members of the present Administration are receptiveand anxious to co-operate with us. Although we must expect president roosevelt as the Presidential election looms ahead in 1944 to show growingcaution in his international commitments, there is no indication that he andhis self-confident Administration are feeling that their days are numbered andthat they must go slow, and Mr. Welles has more than once recently invited usto early discussions. This is not inconsistent with the warnings in paragraph 3.It would be substantially more difficult for Isolationists to force the unscramblingof eggs than to keep the dish off the menu.7. We are fully alive to the need to reinsure in &quot;a discreet way withprominent personalities in the Republican party. Nevertheless, when the presidential election draws near in 1944 it is quite on the cards that president roosevelt will be enjoying the prestige of having led his country through a successful war, and if the United States are engaged in peace-making, there isno individual or combination of individuals on the Republican side which canyet inspire confidence among their own people in world affairs to anything likethe same extent as President Roosevelt and Mr. Cordell Hull.
