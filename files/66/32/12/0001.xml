WE have examined the security of the United Kingdom from thefollowing points of view : (a) Is invasion of the United Kingdom likely to be attempted in 1943 ?(b) If an attempt is made, what will be the scale of attack 1(c) To what extent are we justified in reorganising the forces in the UnitedKingdom on an offensive basis ?2.   We have made the following assumptions : (i) That the reorganisation of existing land forces in the United kingdom to form the largest possible balanced offensive force was started atthe end of 1942.(ii) That existing plans for R.A.F. and United States Air Force expansion and reinforcement up to August 1943 were fulfilled,(iii) That all possible land and air reinforcements additional to (ii) above would be sent to the United Kingdom during the six months&apos;preparatory period for invasion&quot;, subject to no interference with theprogramme and maintenance for the Middle East.Is Invasion of the United Kingdom likely to be attempted in 1943?3. The J.I.C. view, with which we agree, was given in J.I.C. (42) 232 and confirmed in J.I.C. (42) 403 (O) Final.   The J.I.C. wrote :--.&quot; Experience, however, has proved conclusively that combined operations in the face of strongly organised air defences are doomed to failure unless a considerable measure of air superiority is first obtained. We believe this principle to be accepted by the German High Command. Only by effectiveblockade of the British Isles, as a result of complete success m the battle of the Atlantic, could Germany eventually hope to attain the requisite degreeof air superiority to render practicable an attempt to invade the british isles. It is inconceivable that this condition could be fulfilled before 1944.In 1940 the Germans failed to obtain the necessary degree of air superiorityand abandoned their plans for invasion of the British Isles. To-day, in face of the Increased strength of the Allied air forces, their chances of obtainingthis superiority have still further receded.&quot;[24648] B
24. We therefore consider that, provided we do not reduce the forces in thiscountry to an absurd degree, the Germans will not attempt a sea-borne invasion of the United Kingdom in 1943. An air-borne invasion is, in our view, out ofthe question except in conjunction with a sea-borne invasion.If Invasion is Attempted what will be the Scale of Attack?5. Nevertheless, we have examined the maximum possible scale of invasionin detail as follows :   annex I. Seaborne invasion.Annex II. Airborne invasion.6.   This examination is based on the assumptions : (a) that invasion will be attempted in spite of the enemy being unable to achieve air superiority; .....,(b) that the conditions under which the invasion is carried out are those most favourable to the enemy. These conditions, on which the J.I.C.estimated the forces which the enemy might make available for anattack on the United Kingdom in 1943, are : (i) Peace has been made between Germany and Russia this winter,(ii) Except for the proportion needed for security requirements inRussia, German land and air forces have been withdrawn fromthat country.(iii) The Germans have occupied South Caucasus and are thusthreatening Persia and Iraq.(iv) Consequently, British Forces have had to be transferred from theWestern Desert to Persia and Iraq,(v) The Germans are still fighting in the Western Desert and ouroffensive there has been only partially successful,(vi) &quot; Torch &quot; has failed and the majority of the troops have been withdrawn back to the United Kingdom and the major partof the naval forces used in the operation are intact, havingsuffered only reasonable casualties.7. The J.I.C. could foresee no circumstances under which all theseconditions could be fulfilled in 1943 and regarded their own estimates as purelyacademic. Events meanwhile appear almost certain to falsify assumptions (v)and (vi) and there is no evidence to show that assumptions (i), (ii) and (iii) arelikely.Seaborne Invasion.8. We have come to the conclusion that the scales of attack which theDewing Committee* (who were themselves somewhat sceptical on the point) and later the Combined Commanderst considered possible are, in fact, too high.9. Our reasons for thinking that the Germans could not even under themost favourable conditions land as many forces on these shores as has previously been estimated may be briefly summarised as follows : (a) The assumptions upon which these estimates have been based were, asthe Dewing Committee admits, extremely favourable to the Germans.(&amp;) The casualties which our naval and air action would now inflict, and the limitations of assault craft make it unnecessary to anticipate a landing in force elsewhere than in South-East England. [Annex I,paragraphs 8-13.)(c) The scales of attack previously estimated would not, in fact, be possiblebecause :  -    .(i) They were based on a ratio of men to vehicles which was too high.[Annex I, paragraph 15.)(ii) They allowed for the carriage of numbers of personnel in additionto vehicle crews in assault craft with tanks and vehicles.In practice these personnel would have to be carried in completetactical units and in separate assault craft. [Annex I,paragraph 17.)* C.O.S. (41) 283 (O).f C.C. (42) 71
(iii) They made no allowance for any losses from air bombing which enemy invasion craft would sustain during the period of assembly. With the increased bomber effort which would nowbe available a reasonable estimate is that 20 per cent, of thecraft intended for the assaults would not set out. (Annex I,paragraph 25.)&apos; (iv) They assumed that barges would complete one round trip every two days. The disorganisation and casualties inflicted by our bomber effort would make this impossible. (Annex I, para-graphs 29 and 30.)(v) The Combined Commanders planned to use dumb barges onD +1, We consider that, owing to their unhandiness and the congestion which would be caused on the beaches, they could notbe used before D -f 4.   (A annex 7, paragraphs 31 and 32.)10. In short, the maximum scales of seaborne assault which we and the combined Commanders estimate to be possible up to D -f 7 inclusive are Our Estimate. Estimate by Combined Commanders.12 Infantry Regiments (on foot). 26 Infantry Regiments (on foot).12 Independent Tank Battalions. ;      15 Independent Tank Battalions.4 Infantry Divisions (L.E.). 8 Infantry Divisions (L.E.).4 Infantry Divisions. 4 Infantry Divisions.4 Armoured Divisions. 6 Armoured Divisions.11. It follows that the forces required to ensure the security of the UnitedKingdom against an invasion attempt based on our estimate of the scale of attackare less than those considered necessary by the Commander-in-Chief, home forces,* and by the General Officer Commanding, British Troops in NorthernIreland, based on the Combined Commanders&apos; estimate.At Annex III we have compared the forces required under the two estimates.These are *Combined estimates of C.-in-C, HomeOur Forces, and G.O.C.,Estimate.

It seems certain that the enemy will not attempt an airborne invasionexcept in conjunction with a seaborne invasion, and we have, therefore, basedour examination of this airborne threat on the same assumptions as inparagraph 6.From that examination we conclude that (a) If a seaborne and hence an airborne invasion is considered possiblein 1943 no appreciable reduction in the forces estimated byCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, as necessary to meet airborneassault, can be made;(b) If it is accepted that airborne invasion will not be attempted in 1943,material reductions can be made in the numbers of troops allotted for defence against an airborne attack.To what extent are we justified in Reorganising the Forces in the United kingdom on an Offensive Basis?13. We are advised that the forces in this country could be reorganised onan offensive basis on the following phased programme, provided a ruling is now given that reorganisation is to be carried out.* S/OO/243 troops. of 3rd October.124648] b 2

Thus, there will be no risk involved in reorganising the Army forcesin the United Kingdom upon an offensive basis. Furthermore, during the sixmonths&apos; period while the Germans are making their necessary preparations (ifthey ever do so at all) there will be time to reinforce this country with a numberof American divisions and to strengthen our minefields and beach defences.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.15.   We conclude that: (a) Neither seaborne nor airborne invasion will be attempted in 1943.(b) No risk is involved in reorganising forces in the United Kingdom on an offensive basis.(c) The number of troops allotted to the defence of airfields and vulnerable points against airborne attack can be materially reduced.(d) Previous estimates of the possible scale of German attack have been too high.16.   We recommend that (a) The reorganisation of the forces in this country to an offensive basis beauthorised forthwith; the phased programme outlined in paragraph 13above to be accelerated as much as possible.(b) The Commander-in-Chief,  Home Forces, and the General OfficerCommanding, British Troops in Northern Ireland, in conjunction,where necessary, with Service Departments, should re-examine alldefence measures, and particularly the defence of airfields andvulnerable points, on the assumption that the Germans will not attempt seaborne or airborne invasion of the United Kingdom in 1943.The main object of this examination should be to secure economy of man-power.(Signed) A.

ANNEX I.INVASION IN 1943.The Forces available to Germany for the purpose of invading the british isles in 1943 have been estimated by the J.I.C.,* and in doing so the advantages of all the factors, which are in doubt, have been given to Germany. It would beimprobable in fact for this to happen, but it does provide the highest possibleestimate of German forces, and it is the basis upon which we have estimated the threat of invasion.Previous Interservice Examinations.2. There have been three recent inter-service examinations of. the possiblescale of attack which might be expected in an invasion. The firstt was carriedout by the Invasion Committee (the Dewing Report). The second!, consisted ofcomments on the Dewing Report by the three Services and General Headquarters,Home Forces, and of the reply to these comments by the Invasion Committee.The third g was a study of the Dewing Report by the Combined Commanders inthe light of experience gained in planning Operation &quot; Roundup.&quot; In the lightof this study by the Combined Commanders, Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces,wrote his appreciation H and assessed the forces he considered necessary to resistinvasion.In this paper we have taken the Dewing Committee Report, and the subse-quent appreciations by the Combined Commanders, and reviewed them in thelight of our own recent experience, and the changed conditions which will obtainin 1943.SEABORNE INVASION.3. The Dewing Committee in their final conclusion excluded a large-scale attack by the enemy in East Anglia. General Headquarters, Home Forces, intheir comments on the Dewing report  drew attention to the advantages from aGerman point of view of a landing in East Anglia to take place at the same time as an assault on South-East England, and to be followed by a pincer movement on london.4. The difficulties in which the Germans would find themselves if theyattempted a landing in East Anglia are set out by the Dewing Committee in theirreplyf. to the comments of General Headquarters, Home Forces, and later by the combined Commanders in their study   of the Dewing Report.5. Though the Dewing Committee in their final conclusion emphasised thedanger of assuming that the plan ;they had made was the plan that the germans would actually follow, we do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by making an entirely fresh plan. We consider, moreover, that the plan of the Dewing Committee was correct, in so far that the main German seaborneassault would have to be in South-East England.6. The scale of attack can therefore best be assessed by taking the figuresof the Dewing Plan and adjusting them in the light of changed circumstances and recent experience. Before doing so it is valuable to set out the principalassumptions on which that plan was drawn up.(a) German Air Resources. The Dewing Committee assume : (i) That the Germans would be able to leave only 420 first-linefighters on the whole Eastern Front from Murmansk to theMediterranean, but, on the other hand, no account of the Italianor French Air Force was taken.(ii) That all R.T.Us. would be used and that all training organiza-tions would be dislocated to provide tugs for gliders withnecessary pilots.(iii) That the G.A.F. would be capable of carrying out many moresorties per day than they achieved in the Battle of Britain.* J.I.C.

These were the main air assumptions made by the DewingCommittee. Since this report was written the German air-situation has substantially changed for the worse, and we donot, in fact, consider that German air strength can be sufficientto permit any attempt at invasion in 1943.(b) Organization of Barges. It was assumed that the Germans would beable to overcome the many navigational and administrative difficulties that a sea crossing with &quot;such a large number of 6-knot barges would impose on them.   These are ; (i) The clearing of harbours in the dark at a rate of about 1 ship orcraft every minute, in spite of confusion due to air attack and casualties from mines.(ii) The barges would have to be handled and navigated accuratelyduring a night approach in strong tidal streams in spite of hostile action all round them.(iii) Finally, coxswains would have to be capable of handling theirbarges accurately on to the beach roadways in spite of crosstidal streams, in spite of smoke or heavy small-arms fire, inspite of the wrecks of other barges and in spite of the fact thatbarges are slow and unmanceuvrable.(c) Time, Weather and Tide. The Dewing Committee were convinced thatthe difficulties and risks which face the Germans in their invasion planare so great that they could not accept the added handicap ofunfavourable weather conditions. The plan requires the coincidenceof moonlight for the first night, fair weather for at least four days andfavourable tidal conditions. Our own experience in carrying outlarge raids during the last year show how rare it is to obtain the rightsequence of weather conditions.Conclusion.7. Although these assumptions are as favourable as possible to the Germans,it is necessary to make them, as otherwise no operation could be planned.Factors affecting Scale of Attack.(a) IN SUBSIDIARY ATTACKS.8. The Dewing Committee, though they considered a major attack onEast Anglia impracticable, planned a diversion in that area with a force ofone Armoured Division and about 50,000 Infantry. In addition, a small force was to seize Falmouth and other forces were to be held ready to invade Eireand Scotland.East Anglia.9. The diversion in East Anglia as planned by the Dewing Committeeenvisaged the use of 480 tank landing craft, which is more than the total we estimate to be available for the main attack on South-East England. Six-knotbarges are too slow to make any but a short passage in darkness and normal M.T.and personnel ships would have to remain anchored off the shore in order todischarge men, vehicles and stores. The Germans could only provide limitedfighter cover for their protection.10. The Combined Commanders in their examination considered that in1943, with the landing craft available, a diversion in East Anglia, even on thescale envisaged by the Dewing Committee, was not likely. We fully agree withthe Combined Commanders. We consider that our naval and air forces wouldinflict a prohibitive scale of loss upon any such expedition. We therefore conclude that we have no need, to anticipate an enemy landing in force in this area.Eire.11. We have considered the possibility of an attack or diversion in Eire.When this question was considerd by the J.I.C * they came to the conclusion thatany attack on Ireland was likely to be in the nature of a diversion and merelysubsidiary to the invasion of Great Britain. An attack on Eire alone would* J.I.C. (42) 35 (Final).
lay open the attacking forces, deprived as they would be of continuous fightercover, to the full weight of our bomber effort. Even as a diversion the DewingCommittee considered that the German difficulties would be so great that theywould gain no advantage from adopting such a course.12. Whatever difficulties the Germans might have encountered in an attackon Eire in 1942, they would, owing to our greatly increased bomber force, be greater in 1943. On all accounts, and especially in view of German weakness in air forces, we consider that the Germans could not attempt more than a raid onEire, if that. Furthermore, any sea-borne expedition against Eire is likely to suffer severe losses from our naval units, so long as the Germans have no heavynaval units based on the ports of Western France.Other Areas.13. The reasons which make diversions in East Anglia or Eire unlikelyapply even more so to areas further afield. For these reasons, apart from South-East England, the most we need expect are comparatively light raiding forces or feints designed to prevent our moving forces in the direction of the mainbattle.(b) IN MAIN ASSAULT.14. We do not agree with the Combined Commanders that an attack onthe scale on the Dewing Plan can be carried out with the shipping and craftwhich it is estimated will be available to the Germans in 1943. Our reasons are set out in detail in the following paragraphs : Ratio of men to vehicles.15. In planning any amphibious assault the chief limitation imposed onthe scale of attack is the number of vehicles that can be landed. The DewingPlan was based on a ratio of 19 men to every vehicle. The Combined Commandersconsidered that a ratio of 15 to 1 was the minimum figure acceptable to theGermans. Our own normal ratio is 11 to 1 in the assault and 5 to 1 whenthe follow-up is completed. We do not consider that a ratio greater than 14 to 1.in the assault and 11 to 1 when the follow-up is completed would be acceptable to the Germans.Capacity of German Landing Craft.16. The Combined Commanders did not comment on the fact that theDewing Plan made no provision for special transport of personnel, but assumed that personnel would be carried in the tank landing craft and barges whichwere also carrying vehicles and tanks.17. It would not be possible to carry out an assault or even a follow-upby this method. All experience in carrying out raids and planning &quot; Roundup &apos;5shows that vehicles and tanks must be accompanied by their crews, but thatall other personnel must be landed in tactical units, and therefore carried inseparate craft.18. We have consulted C.O.H.Q. and consider that a more accurate estimateof the capacity of German landing craft would be as follows : Tank landing craft       ...    6 vehicles or tanks with crews (30).Medium barges   ...      ...   6 vehicles with crews or 150 men.Small barges      ...      ...   2 vehicles with crews or 50 men.Tank landing craft and medium barges could carry larger numbers for ashort passage (troops on board for under six hours) but at six knots all troops would be on board for longer than this.Effect of Bombing of Invasion Ports.19.   In assessing the degree of destruction to invasion preparations, neitherthe Dewing Committee nor the Combined Commanders expected the enemy to suffer any serious casualties from night bombing they considered that some lossdue to bombing of ports would have to be accepted but they concluded that theuse of bombers against invasion ports and concentration areas before the attackdeveloped would be a waste of effort.
20. It was recommended that it would be more profitable to bomb the invasion ports on the night of D.-1/D. Day and for several nights afterwardswith the object of interfering with the very detailed and intensive programmeof clearing the ports which would be essential to the plan. This point has raiseda great deal of controversy, and the opinion that bombing before the attack wouldbe ineffective was expressed at a time when a comparatively light force of bomberswas attacking individual ships in the heavily defended, port of Brest.21. The Germans will make every effort to reduce the time during whichthe invasion craft are assembled in the Channel ports, but we do not considerthat this can be reduced below 14 days.22. At Appendix &quot; A &quot; to this Annex is a sketch of the concentration ofshipping and barges actually in Calais on the 18th September, 1940, which gives avery good indication of the congestion.23. Since then, and subsequent to the Dewing Report, there have been fourimportant developments : (a) Our bomber force has been, and is being, considerably expanded.   Inaddition, there will be a large U.S.A.A.C. Bomber Force in thiscountry.(b) Heavier bomb loads can now be carried as compared with those carried by the force which bombed the main invasion ports in 1940. Duringthe period September-December 1940 a total of 1,670 tons were dropped on ten of the invasion ports. The combined R.A.F.,U.S.A.A.C. and &apos; Banquet &apos; scheme forces could drop (i) In March 1943, 8.000 tons each week at sustained effort, and47,000 tons in one period of seven days at maximum effort,(ii) In June 1943, 9,000 tons&apos; each week at sustained effort, and54,000 tons in &quot;one period of seven days at maximum effort.(c) Great improvements in aids to navigation and bombing have resulted ina very high degree of accuracy at short range. In addition, ourtactical employment of bombers has been so developed as to minimise the effect of the, enemy defences.(d) Daylight high-level  precision  bombing   is being  developed  on  an increasing scale by the U.S.A.A.C. with good results.24. Conclusion. Once the concentration of landing craft has begun, theeffect of our bombing of the invasion ports, on craft stores and troops by ourlatest types of bomb would be exceptionally heavy, and might make the&quot; portsalmost entirely inoperative during the period of bombing. The interruption tothe German plan would also be considerable owing to the disruption of theirlines of communication and to the interference with the detailed and intensiveprogramme of clearing the ports which would have to be done with clockworkprecision and regularity to achieve success.25. While any estimate of the effect of this bombing must be in the natureof a guess, it is necessary to assume some figure for the purpose of preparing a landing table. We consider that, taken all round, 20 per cent, of the craftintended for the initial assaults are unlikely to set out.Effect of Naval Action.26. The strength of our naval forces based on the United Kingdom is determined not by the threat of invasion but by the need for (a) Light forces to protect our convoys, both ocean and coastal.(6) Light forces for offensive operations against German coastal routes.(c) A Home Fleet to prevent a German capital ship force breaking out intothe Atlantic.The strength of both (a) and (b) has increased considerably in the last year.The result of our dispositions, which would be strengthened in thepreparatory period, is that, on the day of the enemy assault, a large number of light naval forces could quickly be concentrated to repel the enemy. On D + land D + 2 the naval forces engaged are likely to be smaller owing to the needfor ships to replenish supplies of fuel and ammunition, &amp;c. By D+4 the full weight of reinforcements from Western Approaches and elsewhere will have been thrown into the attack, and, provided they are given full air protection, will prove the greatest counter to invasion.
&quot;Casualty rate after Assault Leaves Axis Invasion Ports.27. The Dewing Committee, for the purposes of planning a german invasion, adopted an overall casualty figure for landing craft of 50 per cent, perround trip. This -figure was accepted by the Combined Commanders whenestimating the threat of invasion and making their landing table. The best estimate of casualties from all causes .per round trip which we can make is asfollows :- Per centD Day   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 45D + lD+2D + 3D + 4D-f-5 (and thereafter) ...203045505528. We consider that, of the craft sunk in any one turn-round, 50 per cent,will !have delivered their personnel and vehicles.intact before they are sunk. 0fthe remainder, 50 per cent, of the personnel and M.T. will get ashore. It follows that the percentage of personneTandM.T. actually landing would be as follows : Personnel and M.T.D DayD + lD + 2D + 3D + 4D + 5 (and thereafter)Per cent.899593898887Turn-round.29. The Dewing Committee went into the question of turn-round in some detail. The planned follow-up after the assault was based on making most ofthe barges do one complete round trip every two days. Their ability to do so,,however,&apos; depended upon there being no delay at the beaches and on rapidreloading of the barges on the beaches outside the invasion ports.&quot;30. Experience shows that unless craft are specially designed they are not sufficiently manoeuvrable nor do they have adequate ramps to permit them to landvehicles and get away on the same tide. Moreover, as we have shown in para-graph 23, invasion craft are likely to be subjected to a heavy scale of air attackduring the time that they are reloading, &quot;For these reasons, and bearing in mind the disorganisation and loss of key units which is bound to occur under a heavyscale of air attack, we consider that the minimum turn-round will be as follows : Tank Landing CraftDays.Medium Barges (carrying personnel)Medium Barges (carrying M.T.)Small.BargesDumb &quot;Barges      ...      ...      ...2J-Use of Dumb Barges.31. The Dewing Committee did not envisage using Dumb Barges untilD a- 4 on account of their unhandiness, and the congestion on; the assault beaches.In addition, owing to the concentration of other barges * in Channel Ports, dumbbarges have to be loaded in the Scheldt.32. In the Landing Table prepared by the Combined Planners for the mainattack in Kent and Sussex dumb barges arrive on D i 1. We cannot agree tothis. We consider it would be impracticable for dumb barges to arrive untilD+4.Conclusion on Scale of Attack.33.   At Appendix &quot; B &quot; we have drawn up a possible landing table for thejljl &quot; lmam assault, under the following assumptions,reasonable : -which we consider to be(a) All available invasion craft are employed in the main assault.(b) Eighty per cent, of the total estimated number of landing craft are ableto leave Continental ports for the main assaults.(c) Turn round of craft is as estimated in para. 30.[24648] c
(d) Personnel except for crews will be carried in separate craft from vehiclesor tanks, and capacity of craft is as given in para. 18.(e) The ratio of men to vehicles in the assault is i4 to 1, and when the follow-up is completed, 11 to 1.(/) The casualty rate to craft is as estimated in para. 27, and the proportionof personnel and M.T. which actually land is as estimated in para 28.(g) Dumb barges will not arrive on the assault beaches until D 4- 4.34. From this Landing Table we conclude that the Germans would not beable to transport more than the following forces, the percentage of casualtieswhich they would suffer before landing being shown against the force landedeach day : PercentageCasualties duringVoyage.8 per cent.[Mean of 11 percent, on D day and 5 per cent,on D 4- 1.J8 per cent.Day.D to D + l ..D + 2D + 3D + 4D + 5D + 6D + 7Force Setting Sail.....

ANNEX II.AIRBORNE INVASION.Airborne Threat.1. The number of these types of aircraft estimated to be available by theDewing Committee, the Combined Commanders and the J.I.C. are as follows : Transport Ju. 52    ...........Other types transport...Miscellaneous a/c suit-able as tugs ....Gliders D.F.S.    ...........G.O. 242....Merseburg type.......Dewing estimate for 1942.1,8005005,000100CombinedCommanders&apos;Estimate for april 1943.550506001,50045050J.I.C. Estimate  -for April 1943.(Under conditionsunrealistieallyfavourable tothe enemy).1,000500/6002,5005002. The German airborne resources have been considerably reduced throughevents in the Mediterranean since the J.I.C. paper was written.3. In view of recent events, the scale of airborne attack would be unlikely to exceed that anticipated by the-Combined Commanders.A ctual threat.4. We agree with the Dewing Report that large-scale airborne attacks by day are not likely as they would suffer prohibitive casualties. Thus we agreewith the.opinion in the Dewing Report that tlhe airborne attacks could only takeplace on moonlight nights. The Dewing Report estimated 20 per cent, casualties to parachute troops and gliders.*5. It seems certain that an airborne attack will not be launched except inconjunction with an attempted invasion by sea of the United Kingdom, andthat if, therefore, a seaborne invasion is unlikely, there is no airborne threat to-counter.JDefence against Airborne Attack.6. The forces necessary for defence against airborne attack are determinedprimarily by the number of suitable objectives, particularly airfields, which it isnecessary to defend. This number has not altered materially, since Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, in conjunction with the Air Ministry, made hisappreciation. Thus, if defences against the problematical threat of airborneattack are considered necessary, the number of static and counter-attackbattalions and airfield garrisons previously estimated to be necessary cannot be materially reduced. These forces, which need not consist of men in medicalcategory &quot;A,&quot; are as follows: Static defence battalions......Counter-attack battalions......C.M.P. (V.P.)       .............Sub units for airfields garrisons (themajority being taken over by RA.F.Regiment and Royal Marine grounddetachments before April 1943)263111,400
isConclusions.7.   We conclude that: (a) If an airborne threat is considered possible no appreciable reduction canbe made in the present forces allotted to this role.(b) On the other hand, if it is accepted that an airborne invasion will notbe attempted in 1943, these troops can be materially reduced in number.ANNEX III.ESTIMATE OF LAND FORCES REQUIRED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, INCLUDINGNORTHERN IRELAND.1. In the light of the reduced threat in Annex I we examine below the forcesnecessary for the defence of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. in assessing what formations will, in our view, be required, we have not differentiatedbetween divisions and infantry divisions as this is a matter which can only bedecided by the commander of the area concerned. We have also assumed, as didCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, that: (a) All forces are up to War Establishment and fully equipped in time tocomplete their training.(&amp;) That the Home  Guard is completed in numbers, equipment  andammunition.Comparisons between Estimated Threats.2. The comparative numbers of personnel which it has been estimated thatthe Germans could land in eight days in South-East England, exclusive of thosewhich would become casualties on the way across, are as follows : Our estimate with no major diversion     ...      ... 267,460 [videDewing Committee estimate allowing for a diver- Annex I]sion  in East Anglia with one  armoured division and 50,000 Infantry......      ... 388,100Combined Commanders&apos; estimate allowing for a diversion on the same scale as the DewingCommittee ...      ..........      ... 646,800Combined Commanders&apos; estimate allowing&quot; for a simultaneous major attack in East Anglia   .., 530,100Combined Commanders&apos; estimate with no majordiversion ............      ...      ... 683,9003. On the assumption that the full weight of the German attack is directed against South-East England the relative maximum threats anticipated by us and commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, are of the, following nature : - Estimate by Commander-in-Chief,Our estimate. Home Forces.12 Infantry Regiments (on foot). 26 Infantry Regiments (on foot).12 Independent Tank Battalions. 15 Independent Tank Battalions.4 Infantry Divisions (L.E.). 8 Infantry Divisions (L.E.).4 Infantry Divisions. 4 Infantry Divisions.4 Armoured Divisions. 6 Armoured Divisions.Forces Required.4. The following table sets out Commander-in-Chief&apos;s, Home Forces,estimate of the forces required to meet the maximum threat estimated by the
Combined Commanders, our estimate based on the reduced threat and the decreasesthereby effected : Command.	Estimate by C.-in-C, Home Forces and G.O.C., Northern Ireland.			Our Estimate.			Change.

In 1941 the anticipated scale of attack was Armoured Divisions and 11 Infantry Divisions. Our estimate ofthe scale of attack is approximately the same. We, therefore, considerthat the forces which were considered by the Commander-in-Chief,Home Forces, at the time to be necessary to meet this threat in 1941should be sufficient to meet a similar threat in 1943.(b) Eastern Command. Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces&apos;, estimate isbased on a major landing in this Command. We do not consider that even a&quot; major diversion, and certainly not a major attack, could develop in this area. We have therefore only allowed for forces tohold the beaches in order to guard against enemy raids and for areserve ready to counter such attack.(c) Southern Command. The presence  of  two  armoured  divisions  in southern Command is based on the assumption that a major attack inthis area is possible. We do&apos; not consider this to be the case, and have therefore reduced the command reserve from two armoured divisions to one.(d) General Headquarters Reserve. The size of this reserve was based byCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, on the enemy having available forexploitation a force of four armoured and three infantry divisions.We do not consider that the enemy could have so strong a forceavailable for exploitation.(e) Northern Ireland. We do not consider that an attack on Eire is likely.We have therefore reduced our estimate of the forces required in.Northern Ireland to those needed for internal security.
