THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1942. 2 0---------------:---   fc-RELIEF STOCKS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I am in general agreement with the views expressed in the Minister of FoOd&apos;smemorandum (W.P. (42) 619) on food stocks for relief.2. The United States Administration realise that they must provide thebulk of the relief supplies. But they wish to tell their own public that their owncontribution is part of a joint plan, all the other United Nations also contributing,each according to their capacity. If we, in particular, are not willing to make asubstantial contribution from such surplus stocks as we control, the United states administration may be driven to abandon any idea of an international relief plan and set up instead a purely American relief organisation, on the lines of theHoover organisation after the last war. This would seriously endanger UnitedStates co-operation in other post-war economic arrangements. It would alsoincrease American influence in Europe at our expense.3. As the Minister of Food points out, we could only put very small stocksof food into the relief pool. But relief needs will not be limited to food. Wecould provide, from&apos; surplus stocks held by our own Armed Forces and CivilianDefence Services, considerable quantities of medical supplies, clothing and boots,lorries and ambulances. We might also help with coal, when war demand declines^and with shipping. We shall also hold, overseas, large stocks of Egyptian cotton and other raw materials, and very large stocks of wool. Part of these, in excessof our own immediate requirements, might go to Europe.4. I suggest that we should offer to accept, provided the United States andthe Dominions do likewise, the principle that the Combined Boards should recommend to each Government concerned what supplies can suitably be used for relief. All would then be co-operating on the same basis, but our liabilities wouldbe limited by our resources.5. I agree with the Minister of Food that a joint statement by the UnitedKingdom and United States Governments that both intended, for a period afterthe conclusion of hostilities, to continue the rationing of their own peoples though not necessarily, of course, the actual ration scales then in force--would bevery helpful in our dealings with our European Allies. Some of these may otherwise prove troublesome. The Dutch, Belgians, French and Norwegians allpossess considerable funds, and the Dutch and Norwegians a good deal of shippingas well. If we are not prepared to continue to ration goods in short supply afterthe war, these Allied Governments are likely to break loose and try to act independently. A general scramble for supplies and ships would follow, whichwould not correspond either with our announced intentions or with our national interests. Since it is clear that, whatever we say now, we shall not.be able, whenthe time comes, to give up rationing for some time after the war, the suggesteddeclaration will not, in fact, cost us anything, though it will please both americans and Europeans.H.
