(42) 619.December 31, 1942.TO BE KEPT  UNDER  LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.FOOD STOCKS FOB. RELIEF.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.THE United States Government appear to be on the point of approving an extensive programme of food procurement in the United States to build up stocks for the relief of occupied or liberated areas. The cost envisaged in the report ofa State Department Committee is more than one thousand million dollars beforethe end of 1943. As this report has now been referred to the Combined food board, the British member of the Board must be told how far he can go inpromising British collaboration. If His Majesty&apos;s Government is to seize itsopportunity of moulding these relief plans into the most useful shape, and atthe same time prevent the world from supposing that the Americans alone are readyto relieve reoccupied countries, it must indicate without delay to what extent and by what means the United Kingdom is prepared to collaborate in relief work.It is hoped that Dominions Governments would be willing either to make paralleldeclarations or to associate themselves with whatever declaration we may make.2. We are advised from Washington that Americans will expect a positiveparallel contribution from us. They themselves seem well aware that&quot; on this occasion they are not merely undertaking a huge financial outlay of a kind towhich Lend/Lease has accustomed them, but that they cannot find the actual foodexcept at sacrifice to themselves. The apparent intention of the United states administration is that no existing priority consumer (eg., I/end/Lease countries)shall go unsatisfied as a result of this new demand. Since there are no longer any reliable fields for increasing United States production of the foods required,the sufferer must therefore in the main be the United States domestic consumer.This is an aspect we must not overlook in formulating our own attitude. Inthe past most of our Lend/Lease food has been found by the Americans withcomparative ease; in the future we may have to justify our case with much greaterprecision and to a wider and more critical public if our requirements are to besatisfied.3. The United States relief plan itself is certainly one that we should try to foster. Whilst.I am against earmarking stocks irrevocably, the shortage of most types of food immediately after -the war will be severe, and We should welcome the creation of stores while there is yet time. United States consump-tion is now practically unlimited, and it must be to the advantage of the united nations that the United States should restrict their consumption. It would beeven better if some part of the food thus saved could be held (under combined food Board auspices) in the United Kingdom. It may be that under conditionsof full collaboration in a relief policy the Americans would be the readier to findadditional shipping and bring a portion of these stocks across the Atlantic andnearer to the place where they will ultimately be consumed. This would be amatter for consideration by the Combined Shipping Authorities.4. The extent of our collaboration now. may well be the measure of the partwe shall ourselves be able to play in the administration of relief, and also of the prestige we shall enjoy with our European Allies.[24832]
25. As far as the position within the United Kingdom is concerned, however,our contributions cannot lie in the creation of stocks. Reduction of consumptionis out of the question, and I believe responsible American opinion would agreewith this view. Moreover, substantial destocking has already been necessary,and it is estimated that by the middle of 1943 practically all our stocks will havereached danger levels. All, therefore, that we can be asked to do now is tomake some declaration about the use to which our existing or future stocks maybe put.6. Broadly speaking, our food stocks in the United Kingdom are of thefollowing kinds : (a) Normal bulk stocks.   It has been indicated above that the level of these stocks by end June 1943 will be barely sufficient to maintain, inpresent conditions of transport, the flow of approved and necessarydistribution.(b) Emergency stocks,   (i) There are, of course, a number of stores of miscellaneous commodities at key points throughout the country,which have been built up against the dangers of invasion, air attack, &amp;c. They are of great value for these purposes, but anymisunderstanding which the Americans may have as to their size andtheir usefulness for relief purposes must be removed. They amountto less than 100,000 tons in all, and have been deliberately dispersed-   at some 20,000 different points.(ii) In addition, it has been possible to build up sizeable stocks of.one or two durable commodities, as an indispensable insurance againsta number of contingencies: invasion, air attack, interruption ofimports, military operations, &amp;c. Some of these are Lend-Leasecommodities, such as canned fish and evaporated milk, but the most significant is canned corned beef, mainly of South American origin,- &apos;of which the stock is around 200,000 tons (the Armed Forces have thefirst call on this).7. In theory all these stocks are pooled with those of the Americans underthe declaration made by the Prime Minister and the President when the combined food Board was set up. The American authorities have the right to be givenconfidential information as to their size, actual and prospective, and it is a matter for C.F.B. recommendation to what use they should be put. I would wish to reaffirm-^o the Americans my recognition of these facts.8. I do not recommend segregating any part of our stocks for relief purposesalone, since this might mean undertaking commitments which we could nothonour. In the present restricted and uncertain shipping situation we can make no promise in quantitative terms. What I propose that the United StatesGovernment should be told would be on the following lines : (a) In the event of any reoccupation of countries to which for shippingreasons it may be convenient to send food from the United Kingdom,we will do our utmost to relieve immediate needs without delay, though -it may be necessary to ask for early replacements from abroad, both in food and in shipping space.(b) If other risks, such as. invasion, diminish, and still more if something like peace-time conditions of transport are re-established, the level of stocks which need to be retained in this country will also diminish.; Moreover, when ocean transport becomes less hazardous and circuitous,it should be possible to divert from this country certain cargoesalready afloat.   As these conditions materialise, we will readily con-tribute to relief anything which is considered to be surplus to ourconsumption requirements.(c). Meanwhile, we will communicate to the C.F.B. regularly the level of&apos; our stocks, indicating any commodities in which it appears that we.    have a reserve above consumption requirements. -: (d) Any surplus will be deemed a reserve for &quot;Relief and other con-.,   contingencies &quot; to be used at discretion by the C.F.B.; if owing to urgent and over-riding necessities any part of these reserve stocks has to beused by us, the circumstances will be promptly reported to the Board.9. I feel, however,&apos; that it is our future consumption policy which interests the Americans and the other Allies most nearly, and I would therefore like
His Majesty&apos;s Government to make a reasonably definite statement about our intentions for the immediate post-war period. Whether we like it or not, some form of rationing is bound to continue after the Armistice as the result of thepersistent shortage of shipping and of certain supplies. This is an inescapable-fact, whatever contribution we make to relief, and whatever assistance we receive from America. I suggest that the time has now arrived to make a virtue of necessity. We should invite the United, States Government to make with us ajoint statement to the Allies similar to that authorised by the War Cabineton the 29th June, 1942, for use in certain circumstances, but with this difference-,that it would put the Americans and not only ourselves under an obligation-tothe effect that rationing of food (and presumably also of clothing, &amp;c.) and other suitable measures of control over essential commodities, will continue in our twocountries after the end of hostilities, &quot; so long as the available supplies are not sufficient to meet the urgent needs of Allied countries which have regained their freedom.&quot; Such a statement might come with special force after our recentvictories.10. We should convey these views to the Americans at the earliest possible date, but tell them that our fully considered plans must await consultation withthe Dominions as to the possibilities of making further contributions within theEmpire. Steps have already been taken to inform the Dominions governments that these questions are in the air; but I must tell my colleagues that (so far asfoodstuffs are concerned) apart from cereals, cocoa and coffee, I see little prospectof substantial help from these or other Empire sources.I attach a note on this issue, as an Appendix.   -W.Ministry of Food,December 31, 1942.
Possible sources of Food-stuffs for relief purposes outsideUnited Kingdom but within our Sphere of Influence.THE possibilities fall under three main heads : 1. Increases or adjustments in production.. Possibilities are very limited. Apart from inescapable surpluses (see para-graph 3 below) the food resources of the Empire are already being heavilyexploited, and man-power is likely to be a formidable difficulty in the way of developing them further.2. Reduction of domestic consumption.This is a matter for the Dominions themselves to consider, though the contribution it could make must necessarily be small,3. Purchase and storage of surplus commodities.Cereals we are buying liberally to meet current consumption, and the vastsurpluses in Canada and Australia will not disappear. No further immediate action seems therefore to be needed. We have already undertaken to contribute25 million bushels of wheat (unless our contribution takes the form of shippingor other such assistance) towards the Wheat Relief Pool, the creation of whichwas agreed with the wheat exporting countries at the Washington wheat meetinglast year.The United Kingdom Government is already committed, under the white paper of 1941, to finance half of any storable surpluses accumulating in Australiaand New Zealand, though neither Dominion has so far found it necessary to askfor assistance under the Scheme,Large stocks of cocoa are already held in West Africa, and stocks of sugarmay be accumulated during the next twelve months in the British West Indies,and possibly elsewhere. His Majesty&apos;s Government might offer immediately tocontribute from these stocks towards the proposed contingency reserve.I am considering how far measures could be taken to purchase the coffeeoutput of the Eastern Hemisphere, including the surplus in Madagascar, eventhough present opportunities for shipment to the United Kingdom may be small.Ministry of Food,December 31, 1942.
