The Inspector-General has now returned to this country and I havereceived from General Eisenhower a letter expressing his warm appreciation ofWing Commander HodsolFs assistance and asking that he may be appointedadviser in Civil Defence matters to Allied Headquarters in North Africa. I haveascertained that what General Eisenhower has in mind is that the Inspector-General should keep him informed of developments in Civil Defence and shouldbe enabled to visit North Africa at, say, six-monthly intervals to inspect and advise on Civil Defence arrangements in that area.In view of the obvious importance of such arrangements to the Allied effort,I am, with the Prime Minister&apos;s concurrence, agreeing at once to the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s request.The Inspector-General was accompanied by Commander I. Franks (R.N., ret.),Senior Regional Officer in the North-Western Civil Defence Region, and Com-mander Franks is remaining in Algiers as Civil Defence adviser on the staff ofGeneral Eisenhower. He has since been joined by Capt. S. H. Daw, A.R.P. Officerof the City of London, and Mr. C. H. Smith, Regional Officer, Class III, for theSouth-Western Civil Defence Region, who will act as his assistants, Mr. A.Croad, Assistant Chief Engineer of the Ministry of Home Security, has also gone to Algiers to advise on the provision of shelters and other structural precautions.At the request of the Air Ministry Professors Bernal and Zuckerman of the research and Experiments Branch of the Ministry of Home Security will shortly go out to collect information on the nature and effects of enemy bombing.A report by the Inspector-General on his visit is printed as an Annex tothis paper. It shows clearly the importance of making adequate provision for civil Defence in the area occupied by the Allied armies in North Africa. Indeed,we may consider ourselves fortunate that, so far, the enemy has not attackedour bases there,on a large scale. Had he done so it might have had serious results on operations.I realise that in the circumstances in which the North African operation was planned it may not have been possible to make provision beforehand forCivif Defence arrangements, or to include in the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s staff officers with experience of Civil Defence at home; but there may be future operations in enemy occupied territory which will give rise to similar problems and it is for consideration whether the Ministry of Home Security should notbe brought into future preparations at an early stage and arrangements madefor selected officers to accompany the troops so that Civil Defence problems maybe tackled at the earliest possible moment.Another issue that arises is whether steps can be taken to stimulate andenliven French civilian morale and self-respect in North and West Africa.H.

annex.CIVIL DEFENCE AND PASSIVE AIR DEFENCE IN north africa.Report by the Inspector-General, Ministry of Home Security.. .WE arrived in Algiers on the 1st December and spent the first two days inmaking contacts with various people and finding out the position.To all intents and purposes nothing had been done at all and the problemrapidly resolved itself into two parts: one purely military, requiring measures for the protection of docks and other places entirely under military control, andthe other civil, concerning Civil Defence in the towns liable to bombing as a resultof our occupation.The Army Passive Air Defence arrangements were quite inadequate andthere was no co-ordination between naval and military authorities in the dockareas. There was a little army fire service equipment, but it was inadequate and wrongly organised; there was no fire-watching of any sort, and to all intentsand purposes no arrangements for even first aid and rescue. The militaryauthorities on the spot, though they realised these deficiencies, were too fully occupied with work directly connected with operations to make better arrange-ments. So far as the French were concerned, we soon discovered that althoughon paper there were elaborate arrangements, in reality they were totally inadequate in every respect.; . From the point of view of Civil Defence and Passive Air Defence theproblem &apos;was to make an adequate organisation to cover Casablanca in Morocco;Oran, Algiers, Bougie, Phillipville, Bone and Constantine in Algeria; and eventually Bizerta, Tunis, Sousse and Sfax in Tunisia.Far and away the most urgent problem was to get some proper organisedprotection in the docks at Algiers.Military A rrangements.By the 5th December I was able to get out an appreciation of the positionand make broad recommendations which were approved by the Commander-in-Chief. the same day.   These recommendations were (1) that there should be a proper advisory staff to the Commander-in-Chief,responsible for both Civil Defence and Passive Air Defence, including fire.Commander Franks was appointed adviser and given the local rank of Captain,R.N.; Captain Elson, the Inspector of Army Fire Service, was appointed FireAdviser for North Africa on the staff of Captain Franks, and I telegraphed forother officers to come out, including someone to give technical advice;(2) that North Africa should be divided into three zones : a Western Zonewith Headquarters at Casablanca to cover the Moroccan seaboard, a CentralZone with Headquarters at Algiers to cover the Algerian area, and an EasternZone with Headquarters at Tunis to cover the Tunisian ports.A Civil Defence Adviser, who would be on Captain Franks&apos; staff, should eventually be put into each of these Zones, but for the time being attention shouldbe concentrated on the Algerian Zone since that was by far the most important;(3) that in each of the Base Sub-Areas into which the country is divided bythe Army the organisation should consist of three parts (a) Military : to cover dock areas, or other areas entirely required for military purposes; these areas to be under military control and to rely entirely on military resources;(b) Civil: embracing areas not covered by (a) above; these to be under localcivil control and to rely on civil resources;(c) Co-ordinating Control.   In order properly to co-ordinate the militaryand civil areas and to undertake certain important tasks covering both these areas, an officer to be appointed on the staff of each of the base Sub-Area Commanders to act as general co-coordinator;(4) that in each docks area there should be a military officer in charge, whowould be entirely responsible for operations in the area, including co-ordinationof all naval and military resources which should be pooled for this purpose.This arrangement was accepted at a conference between the authorities concerned; a model scheme for the docks at Algiers was worked out and approved and is being put into force in Algiers.   Similar schemes are being introduced in
the ports and important towns up to the front line.   The model plan includeddetails of all the various requirements&apos;, including training.A similar note dealing with the responsibilities of the co-ordinating con-troller was also drawn up, approved and sent out to all those concerned, tobe put into force as soon as possible.Civil A rrangements.- On the civil side conversations were held with the French authorities,including General Francois, who is responsible for Civil Defence in the whole ofAlgeria. As a result of these conversations contact was made with the &apos;&apos; Chefde la defense passive &quot; (A.R.P. Controller) for the city of Algiers and a careful examination was made with him of the whole of his arrangements. At the sametime, the Inspector of Army Fire Service was put in touch with the Chief of theFife Brigade and carried out a survey to find out static water requirements andto investigate the position of existing water supplies.A model scheme for the city of Algiers (population 400,000) was prepared and translated into French, and we then went through the scheme and discussed with the Controller wa)rs by which we could get his organisation up to the required standard. We did not make any attempt to impose arbitrarily our modelplan on him, but used it rather as a method of showing him what was wanted andas a means of getting his own organisation brought up to what we considered theright level.The French local authorities had no post-raid organisation at all, and theproblem was tremendously complicated by reason of the complete lack of materials of all kinds, including clothing and food. I decided that it was no good trying to get the French to swallow too much at once, and that it was wisest to concen-trate on getting their Civil Defence organisation for dealing with the actual raidup to a reasonable degree of efficiency to start with. I accordingly prepared a,note, which was issued to all Base Sub-Area Commanders informing them thatif a heavy raid occurred they would have to undertake the immediate post-raidarrangements, e.g., feeding, clothing, and probably housing the homeless popula-tion. I stressed the importance of action by us to deal with the effects of bombing,which we had brought on the French, and the Commander-in-Chief was in, full agreement with the proposal; the important thing being to warn the BaseSub-Area Commanders of the problem that might face them.A small vital points sub-committee was set up to prepare a list of vital pointsboth on the military and civil side, and to decide on the nature of the protectionrequired against low flying attack, parachute attack, sabotage and bomb damage,and to make recommendations as to the necessary action. N othing has been doneon this side at all, and there are some extremely important power stations,which, if put out of action, would paralyse whole districts of North Africa, since they are connected up with a very elaborate grid system.A note was also prepared setting out the defects of the French Civilorganisation for the information of Base Sub-Area Commanders so that theywould appreciate the amount of help they were likely to get from the French,and the amount of help they might have to give to the French.The following were the main defects in the French organisation : (a) lack of proper co-ordinated control of the Civil Defence Services andover-centralisation, i.e., the controller was trying to operate nearly all the services himself;(&amp;) lack of provision of static water on anything like the scale required,even where it existed at all;(o) insufficient size of the.local fire service, and almost complete lack of fire-watching and fire-guard service, except on paper;(d) lack of equipment, transport and fuel; e.g., Algiers had three ambulanceswhich could not be started without petrol which they did not possess;(e) inadequate scale of shelter provision;(/) almost complete lack of training, coupled, of course, with little experienceof actual raiding;(g) inadequate size of the services generally and lack of volunteers, e.g.,.the first aid parties in Algiers consisted of nine men;(A) inadequacy of actual provision already made, e.g., one first aid post we saw in Algiers was located underground in such a place that astretcher could not be got into it, and provision in the first aid postwas a good deal worse than in first aid points I have seen in a villagein England;(i) almost complete lack of enthusiasm, interest and esprit de corps.
So far as the direction of the French services goes, the people are all there,e.g. engineers and so on, and they are all probably quite good, men. They will be perfectly adequate to carry out the work on advice from us as to what is required,provided the question of materials can be solved. This is going to be one of the biggest difficulties of all since the Germans have absolutely stripped North Africabare, and although, for example, it is a very big cement-producing country, thereis an almost complete lack of cement because there is no coal to produce it. Therewere no spare parts for water pipes, electrical power stations or anything else,and in the case of power stations the situation is going to be extremely difficultbecause the machinery is all either German or Norwegian. .I later visited Oran for discussion with the American 5th. Army. Thesituation was even worse here than at Algiers, where there were some Army fire service units in the docks, although not enough. At Oran there were only fourtrailer pumps but nobody knew how to work them, and the Americans had noideas of the organisation required. They have nowr started, I hope, on the rightlines.Before I left I had a long talk with the Commander-in-Chief and told him that to get some sort of Civil Defence organisation going it would be quiteessential that some materials were made available. I told him I attachedparticular importance to putting the French Services into uniform not only tohelp their esprit de corps but to attract volunteers, because provision of a suitwould be a tempting bait. The Commander-in-Chief was in complete sympathy with this proposal, and within the limits of other war requirements these needswill be met as far as possible. I am sure that the building up of an adequateCivil Defence organisation will be an important factor in helping the morale of the French, which is unfortunately at a very low level indeed.E. J.
