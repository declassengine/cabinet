/      /THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government memorandum by Secretary of State for India and Burma.In connection with, the proposals contained in the Joint Memorandum by the deputy Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the lord privy Seal, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 544), approvedby the War Cabinet on the 9th December, I should like to draw attention to theposition of India and Burma. In general, I agree with the proposed joint declaration of principles by which parent States should be guided in their policiestowards Colonial territories, and the practical application of these principles tothe region of South-Eastern Asia in the first instance. One of the most importantfeatures of these proposals is, in my view, that each parent State should have theunquestioned right to administer its own territories.2. It seems best to assume in our conversations with the United StatesGovernment that the principles and their application are irrelevant to India&apos;scase. India is not geographically within the region of the Far East or South-Eastern Asia. Moreover, the principles apply to &quot; peoples who are unable. ... to assume full responsibility for their affairs.&quot; India, being on thethreshold of self-government, cannot be regarded as in statu pwpillari; and if she came, for example, into the Regional Commission, she would very likely claimto do so on the same footing with the parent States and China. But at present this would be premature and India&apos;s interests in the Far East could well be lookedafter by His Majesty&apos;s Governments representative on the Commission. If india were directly represented this might lead to undesirable interference andcomplications.3. As regards Burma, the position is not quite so simple. Self-governmentis our declared policy for that country as well as for India; but owing to theoccupation of the country by tho Japanese there is bound, I think, to be inthe interests of Burma herself an interim period after reoccupationfor the restoration of order and reconstruction before we can transfer responsibility to the Burmese, and even then we shall probably haveto continue to shoulder the primary responsibility for the defence of Burma.Moreover, Burma undoubtedly belongs geographically to the region of Soutih-Eastern Asia. It may therefore be desirable that she should be covered, so farat any rate as a general defence scheme is concerned. On the other hand, asregards her internal, social, economic and political development, any common policy agreed on by the parent States concerned in the region might obviouslyhave only a limited application to Burma in view of the prospect of her earlyassumption of full responsibility for at any rate her own domestic affairs. Inthis connection I note that it is contemplated that besides therepresentatives of the parent States on the Commission, provision shouldalso be made for the representation of other nations, such as, in the case ofthe Far East Region, China, which have a major defence or economic interestin the region. I presume that China would only be concerned in the work of theCommission so far as strictly international questions affecting her. interests aroseand not in the formulation of the parent States&apos; common policy in regard tothe internal affairs of the territories under their charge. If there were anysuspicion that China might be allowed to participate in policy of this kind,I fear this would have most unfortunate reactions in Burma at any rate.Printed for the War Cabinet.
