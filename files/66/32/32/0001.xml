(42),169th Conclusions, Minute 3) I was asked to submit a report by the Allied SuppliesExecutive setting out [a) what we could send to Russia during January, february and March, in fulfilment of our obligations and (b) the implications of the course proposed.2. The attached Report explains the considerations which we have had inmind in reaching our conclusions. These have been embodied in a programme(Annex) showing the major military items which could be made available for loading in the United Kingdom during the first three months of 1943. Sinceframing this programme, however, we have been informed that the Admiraltycannot, without additional assistance from the United States in respect ofdestroyer escorts, undertake the sailing of Convoys JW. 52 B, 53 and 54 in thelatter part of January, and in February and March. If this position is accepted and escorts cannot be provided&quot;, we shall be unable to despatch any supplies toRussia after the middle of January. Nevertheless, we have decided to submit our report on the assumption that Convoy sailings will continue during January,February and March and will then cease.3.   I recommend : (a) That the War Cabinet should now authorise the despatch of the suppliesset out in the Annex against the month of January;(b) That, on the asumption that the sailing of convoys in January, february and March proceeds as planned, the Allied Supplies Executive should review the programme for the two latter months with a view to deter-mining more precisely what materials should be despatched to russia by the Northern Route, the figures in the Annex being treated forthis purpose as minima;(c) That no further commitment should be undertaken  in respect of aluminium, but that, if the United States authorities agree to repay2,000 tons of the metal immediately, we should advance this amountfrom United Kingdom stocks for shipment by the Northern route inJanuary.-    A.

REPORT BY THE ALLIED SUPPLIES EXECUTIVE.1. In the memorandum which the Foreign Secretary submitted to the War,Cabinet on the 13th November (W.P. (42) 525), he explained that, owing to the discontinuance of convoy sailings, most of our September quota, and the whole ofthe October, November and December commitments, were in theory piling upawaiting a shipping opportunity. This accumulation was theoretical rather than&apos;actual, since the Allied Supplies Executive had decided on the 9th October thatit would suffice if Departments,-were to keep in hand a full month&quot;s stock of protocol and other commitments while continuing arrangements for the rnanu-facture of all industrial equipment and non-military material which was beingmade to Russian specifications.2. When, therefore, it was decided by the Defence Conrmittee (Operations)on the 23rd November^ that the sailing of convoys by the Northern Route shouldbe resumed at the end of the year, we called forward for loading on the Januaryconvoy (the December convoy being already fully loaded) the maximum number ofmilitary items of - the highest priority which could be found from the materialheld in stock.3. The programme for the 10 British ships to sail in the first part of the january Convoy (J.W. 52 A) has been settled in agreement with the Soviet trade delegation. The cargoes are shown in the Annex against the Convoy number.The remainder of J.W; 52 A will consist of four United States ships loaded in north America, and one United States ship left over from J.W. 51. There willbe available for the second part of the January Convoy (J.W. 52 B) four american and five Soviet dry cargo vessels now in United Kingdom ports, which, with theaddition of 2 tankers and 5 American ships loaded in the United States, willmake up a total of 32 merchant vessels for the two parts of the January Convoy.4. - * For the loading of the 9 American and Soviet ships earmarked forJ.W. 52 B there are available some 70,000 shipping tons of cargo comprisingfoodstuffs discharged from United States ships, machine tools, tin, cordite,chemicals, sisal rope, cocoa, medical supplies and other material which would suffice to fill all the cargo space available. The Soviet Trade Delegation have asked, however, that these 9 ships shall carry the following military stores inpriority to the material already available : -205 aircraft.112 tanks (preferablv Valentines).120 M.T. Vehicles (30-cwt.).200 motor cycles.45 G.L. II Sets.30 workshop lorries.8 carriers, starting and charging.8 submarine batteries.10 130-mm. naval guns and spare barrels, aircraft and tank spares, ammu-nition, aerodrome equipment, naval stores, magnetic mines, G.S.respirators and anti-gas stores.5. Except as regards aircraft (see paragraphs 7-9 below), M.T. vehicles(see paragraph 10) and the G.L. II Sets (which are awkward cargo), these requestscan for the most part be met, but in this event much of the non-military materialavailable will be shut out. We recommend that, as far as possible, the orderof priority indicated by the Russians should be followed.6. For the February and Ma,rch Convoys (J.W. 53 and 54) there will benot less than five nor more than 10 United States ships loaded in North America.The Minister of War Transport will, if the War Cabinet decide that these convoys are to sail, have to find 8-10 ships to load cargoes in the United King-dom to fill places in these convoys. This he is prepared to do. These convoyswill thus comprise not more than 20 merchant vessels each.7. Aircraft. The unfulfilled United Kingdom commitment in respect of fighter aircraft up to the 31st December, 1942, amounts to 949 machines, but of these 429 Airacobras are due to be delivered direct from the United States* D.O. (42) 18th meeting, minute 3.
via the Persian Gulf or the Alaska Route, leaving 520 Hurricanes for deliveryfrom the United Kingdom to North Russia.Towards working off this backlog of 520 Hurricanes the Air Ministry:  [a) Have made available 250 Hurricans for Convoy J.W. 52 A;(b) Propose to provide 50 Hurricanes to be loaded on each of the other threeconvoys in the programme.This will still leave a deficiency of 120, but the Air Staff are unable, owingto the necessity for the reinforcing of overseas theatres of operation, torecommend the release during December to &apos;March inclusive, of more than the400 aircraft mentioned above to meet this backlog commitment.8. We have no formal commitment to the U.S.S.R. in 1943 in respect of aircraft, but are under an obligation in Annex III of the Second Protocol(W.P. (42) 438) to &apos;&apos; give further consideration to the question of continuingor increasing supplies of aircraft after the end of 1942.&quot; The Minister ofProduction in his report on his visit to America (W.P. (42) 568) states that hehas secured an undertaking from the United States Government to make availableto us, as an allocation for which we may claim credit against a prospective com-commitment to Russia, of 150 Airacobras per month during 1943. In order tocontinue the flow of fighters to Russia at the existing rate .of 200 per month,the Secretary of State for Air recommends the supply of 50 Hurricanes. per month starting in January. The aircraft despatched on this account during january, February and March would be additional to those set out inparagraph 7 above.9. The effect of these proposals, as shown in the programme, will be that250 Hurricanes would be sent in J.W. 52 A and 100 Hurricanes in each of theother three convoys. ,10. Tanks. Our commitment under, the Second Protocol amounts to 1.500tanks up to the end of December, of which 405 are &quot;Valentines from Canadianproduction to be shipped in American vessels. Including the 235 programmedfor J.W. 852 A, 550 tanks have already been made available, leaving 545 whichshould have been shipped by the end of the year if our 1942 commitment wereto have been fulfilled. The&quot;Secretary of State for War is prepared to allocate&apos;up to 525 tanks for shipment in J.W. 52 B and later convoys as shown in the annex, and will accept the delay in the equipment of a tank brigade from July-September 1943, which will result from this allocation.This will mean that by the end of March we shall have reduced our deficiency in tanks owing up to the end of December to 20, but will have made no contribu-tion towards the quota for 1943, which, as expressed in.the Second Protocol, wasto be, if possible, a combined offer from ourselves and the United States of 1,000monthly on a basis to be decided at a later date. Towards making good this deficiency in the supply of tanks, the War Office can offer a small number of30-cwt. lorries for shipment in the latter part of January.11. M.T. Vehicles. We have no commitment in the Second Protocol for thesupply of lorries to the U.S.S.R. The United States Government undertook tofurnish trucks at the rate of 10,000 per month over the twelve months ending nextJune, but up to the end of October they had exported no more than 10,224 vehicles,against a commitment of 40,000. We ourselves provided 3,000 lorries during the moscow Protocol period, and since then have made available 800 vehicles,including the 300 included in J.W. 52 A.The War Office are unable to provide any 3-ton lorries from United kingdom production during the first three months of 1943, but could make available 4,000of this type of vehicle from Canadian production, if they could be shipped. we doubt, however, whether this offer would be acceptable to the U.S.S.R., as thelorries are in Beta Pack and would involve an uneconomical use of shipping space.We recommend that, in order to provide some compensation for our failure to supply the total number of tanks required to fulfil our commitment, 80 30-cwt.lorries should be supplied in January and that the possibility of finding some more in February and March should be further examined.12. We understand that the American authorities in this country have offered the Soviet Trade Delegation to make available up to 1,200 boxed Jeepsfor shipment in J.W. 52 B. If the Russians will accept this offer, which will involve the shutting out of lower priority cargo, we should offer no objection toloading these vehicles.[24803]        - b 2
13. Naval Supplies. The stores available for shipment in january february and March are set out in the Annex under those months.14. Aluminium. Under the Second Protocol, as extended by Annex III,the United Kingdom commitment was a total of 12,000 tons for delivery in thesecond half of 1942. This has been delivered. The Russians have now askedfor a further 6,000 tons to be shipped in December and January. The request,however, in its latest form is for the immediate release of 2,000 tons from theUnited Kingdom for shipment by the Northern route.The Ministers of Production and Aircraft Production cannot recommend theWar Cabinet to make this amount available from United Kingdom supplies,whether in this country or in Canada.The minimum stock that should be held in this country is 50,000 tons;existing stocks are some 45,000 tons. The stock at the end of this year will beabout 42,000 tons. On the basis of 1943 supplies and requirements, UnitedKingdom stocks are likely to fall by the end of 1943 to some 23,000 tons. even for this stock we are dependent on the repayment by United States in 1943 ofsome 13,000 tons lent by the United Kingdom in 1942. The United States hasno reserve stock of ingot, and is itself now faced with an ingot deficiencythroughout 1943. This raises the doubt whether, and if so when, this repaymentwill be forthcoming.The Ministers concerned are willing to provide 2,000 tons from UnitedKingdom stocks for immediate shipment to Russia by the Northern route, subjectto immediate repayment by the United States of this amount to the UnitedKingdom. This, if agreed, will represent no more than an accelerated instalment of the United States monthly commitment of 2.000 tons.15. Miscellaneous Cargo.-We do not anticipate any difficulty in bringing forward, during the three months under review, the supplies from UnitedKingdom stocks or production which we have undertaken to send to Russia during that period. Some acceleration of the fate of delivery could be attained in respectof tin.   &quot;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,December 22, 1942.
