COMBINED MUNITIONS ASSIGNMENT BOARD.(1) Constitution.MUNITIONS Assignment Boards were set up in London and washington to make effective the agreement made in January 1942 by the Prime Minister ofGreat Britain and the President of the United States, by which the entiremunitions resources of Great Britain and the United States were placed in acommon pool, about which the fullest information would be interchanged andfrom which assignments, both in quantity and priority, were to be made to theUnited Nations in accordance with strategic needs.  &apos; *    ^-(2) Terms of Reference.No specific terms of reference were given to the Boards, but a Directive was issued to the Washington Board by the Combined Chiefs of Staff as follows :  4  $fc ^ ^ ^ *^*&quot;2. Working in close collaboration with the corresponding Londonorganisation, the Board will maintain full information of the entiremunitions resources of Great Britain and the United States and translatesuch resources into combat forces and their material reserves. It will submitsuch statement to the Combined Chiefs of Staff and keep the estimate up todate in the light of war developments and also of variations in productionachievements and prospects, as ascertained through effective liaison with thesupply authorities. Such periodical revisions will be submitted in orderthat the Combined Chiefs of Staff may be fully informed and recommend themeasures necessary to keep planned requirements programmes in line with , (a) strategic policy;(6) changing operational conditions in their effect on war material; and(c) the realities of production.&quot;3.   Under such strategic policies/directives and priorities as have beenapproved, and in accordance with agreements with the corresponding Londonorganisation, the Board will be responsible for making assignments of the-  stocks and production of finished war material to the United States andGreat Britain and to others of the United Nations.&quot;(3) Organisation.The. theory of assignment is that the production of all the participatingnations is pooled and divided in accordance with strategic needs. It was hopedthat the Dominions would agree to pool their production either in London orWashington, and that therefore the total production of the British Empire andthe United States would be available for distribution amongst the United nations in accordance with the strategy decided by the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Thishope has not been entirely fulfilled, and the present arrangements for poolingproduction for assignment purposes are as follows : (A) London Munitions Assignment Board.Composition:Chairman: Mr. Oliver Lyttelton.British and American representatives of the three Services.This Board assigns* United Kingdom production and allocates* assignmentsmade to the United Kingdom in London, Washington, Ottawa and Canberra.Six Sub-Committees have been established to deal with the different aspects ofthe work of assignment, and these are: Naval; Army; Air; S.A.A.; R.D.F.;and Engineer Stores.* See note on page 3.
(B) Munitions Assignment Board, Washington.Composition:. Chairman: Mr. Harry Hopkins.American and British representatives of the three Services.This Board assigns^ United States production and allocates* assignmentsmade to United States in Washington, London and Ottawa. ThreeSub-Committees have been established to deal with different aspects of the workof assignment; these are Munition Assignments Committee (Navy), (Ground)and (Air).(C) Ottawa A ssignment Board.Composition:Chairman: Mr. Carmichael (Director of the Department of munitions and Supply).Representatives of the Canadian, British and United States Armies.This Board assigns Canadian production of Army equipment.. The officialposition of this Board has not yet been clarified. It is not responsible either tothe Combined Chiefs of Staff or even to the Canadian Chiefs, of Staff, but forthe time being appears to. be under the control of the Canadian Minister ofMunitions.In effect, Canadian production is assigned either (a) to Canadian Home Defence, or(b) to United Kingdom for allocation in London (including items earmarked for Canadian forces in the United Kingdom), or(c) to United States for allocation in Washington (being contracts placed inCanada by War Supplies, Ltd.).In some cases Canadian production has been assigned in Ottawa direct to new Zealand and China.(D) Australian Assignment Committee, Canberra.Composition:Chairman: a representative of the Australian Chief of General Staff.Australian representatives of the three Services and of the Ministry ofMunitions.A representative of the United Kingdom (appointed by the War Office).A representative of the United States (appointed by Commander-in-Chief, S.W.P.A.).This Committee will start to function towards the end of this year and willassign Australian production of Army - weapons and ammunition. Presumablyany production surplus to the needs of Australian and united States Forces inS.W.P.A. will be assigned to United Kingdom for allocation in London.The committee will be responsible to the Australian Defence Committee and ultimately to the Australian War Cabinet.(E) Munitions production in New Zealand, South Africa and India has sofar been almost entirely absorbed by domestic needs, and this local production istaken into account when making allocations in London. If and when productionin these countries shows a surplus over domestic heeds, either a local AssignmentBoard will have to be established, as in the case of Australia, or the surplus willhave to be placed at the disposal of one of the existing Boards. &apos;    -(4) Activities.It will be seen from the foregoing that for practical purposes the distribution,of munitions surplus to the domestic needs of the producing country is centredin London and Washington. It is clearly essential for the smooth working of. the assignment machinery that demands for munitions on behalf of any one country or theatre should be presented in only one of these two centres. A system hasbeen evolved by which the United Nations (with the exception of Russia, which* Note. The terms &quot;assign&quot; and &quot; allocate &quot; are really synonymous, but in London, byusage, an &quot; assignment &quot; has come to mean the distribution in bulk from one MunitionsAssignment Board to another where it is &quot;allocated&quot; to a specific country or theatre lyingwithin the strategic sphere of the latter Board.[24698]   . b 2
is subject to a special Protocol agreement) are divided into two groups a Britishgroup&quot; and an American group. The members of the British Empire and theEuropean Allies and Neutrals naturally fall into the British group. Not onlyare they equipped almost entirely with British types of military equipment, but from the closeness of their association with the British Forces full details of their requirements are readily available in London, and the whole of their circum-stances and needs can best be assessed here. China and the South american republics fall naturally into the American group for similar reasons.The requirements of the whole British group are ascertained in Londonand, as far as possible, they are satisfied by assignments from British production(including that part of Canadian and Australian production assigned to UnitedKingdom in Ottawa and Canberra). The requirements which cannot be met inthis way are submitted by the British representatives in Washington, where theyare considered together with the requirements of the American group. TheBoard in Washington makes a bulk assignment to the British group, which is thenallocated in London amongst the members of the group.The process for assignment to the American group is exactly similar to thatdescribed above for the British group, only with the roles of London and washington reversed.This division of the United Nations into two Groups has not worked entirelysmoothly, nor is it absolutely rigid. For instance, it has been found more convenient, for operational as well as production reasons, for Australia andNew Zealand to bid direct in Washington for aircraft and motor vehicles. Also,the United States has entered into Lend-Lease arrangements with most of thenon-Axis world, including the Dominions. This tends to encourage some membersof the British Group (e.g., Turkey and Fighting French) to deal direct -withWashington. The political implications of this tendency are fairly clear, and theconfusion caused to the assignment machinery is obvious.The great majority of the work of assignment is carried out by theCommittees of the two Boards. Both in London and Washington the representa-tives of the two groups can state their demands to the various committees,supported if necessary by the representative of the particular country concerned.If the resulting assignment is unsatisfactory to either party appeal can be madeto the Boards and, if necessary, to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. In the last resortthe appeal can be taken to the Prime Minister and President.When the Munitions Assignment Boards were first established there was,generally speaking, an acute shortage of almost all types of munitions, and,therefore, to meet the rapidly changing fortunes of war, assignments were madeon a short-term basis of one month firm and two months tentative. . As production programmes become more settled and the deficiencies of equipment are reducedit should be possible to extend considerably the period for which assignments aremade firm. This would greatly facilitate shipping programmes and has alreadybeen done for some items, such as tanks and motor vehicles.At first the purpose of the Assignment Boards was to distribute &apos;&apos; finished munitions &quot; only. As it became apparent that most of the items required bythe Armed Forces of the United Nations were in short supply, the WashingtonRoard extended the scope of its control to cover anything, from tanks to cottonwool, which might be required by the Armed Forces, whether or not these itemswere also a civilian requirement. As the United States is now the major producerfor the United Nations, this tendency of the Washington Board to extend itscontrol over a large range of supplies falling outside the definition of munitionshas had to be followed, to some extent, by the London Board.The Washington Board also exercises the important function of collecting,from both the British and American groups, the total requirements of all the items needed by the Armed Forces from United States production, screening themand presenting them to the C.P.R.B. The London Board does not perform thisfunction, which is carried out in the British group by the three Services inconjunction with the Ministry of Production.Offices of the War Cabinet.
COMBINED PRODUCTION AND RESOURCES BOARD.(1) Constitution.The Combined Production and Resources Board was set up on 9th June,1942, on a joint directive from the Prime Minister and the President.(2) Terms of Reference.The functions of the Board are set out in the directive, which is given inthe Annex attached hereto on page 7.(3) Organisation.The Board consists of Mr. Lyttelton, the British Minister of Production,and Mr. Donald Nelson, Chairman of the War Production Board. On10th November, 1942, Canada joined the Board, and Mr. Howe, Minister for munitions and Supply, was appointed as the third member of the Board.The Board operates from Washington. The two original members of theBoard appointed deputies, Sir Robert Sinclair and Mr. Knowlson, who are incharge of the normal operations of the Board., Mr. Howe will presumably appoint a deputy in due course. The Board has a Combined Secretariat, and a CombinedPlanning Staff, whose duty it is to determine the facts on questions arising for decision and to present them to the Board. The staff of the Board is drawn fromofficials of the member countries, and operates as one combined unit.In London there is a London Committee of the Board which deals with thoseaspects of the work of the C.P.R.B. which are most conveniently handled inLondon, such as adjustments which arise from the supply of United States Armyneeds in United Kingdom.Mr. Lyttelton is represented on this Committee in his absence by Sir WalterLayton, and Mr. Nelson by Mr. Harriman, or in his absence by Mr. Philip Reed.The vast majority of questions which come before the Board affect only, theUnited States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.The original intention was to confine the Board to the United States and theUnited Kingdom, but the Canadian munitions production programmes are so closely interwoven with those both of the United States and the United kingdom that it soon became clear that Canadian membership was essential.It has not been found necessary to provide a link between the Board and russia. The essential task of combined planning is to share scarce resourcesbetween the military and non-military programmes of the countries concerned :this implies elasticity of programmes and frequent adjustments. The programmeof supplies to Russia is laid down by protocol as a first charge upon combinedresources, and is not subject to change. Furthermore, transport difficultiesrender impossible the essence of integration between Britain and North Americawith Russia, which is the concentration by each nation upon what it producesbest, supplying the others accordingly.Rather different considerations apply to China; the main combined task isto get munitions into China, and questions of combined production planningcannot arise at this stage.(4) Activities.The central function of C.P.R.B. is to combine the production programmes of the three countries into a single integrated programme adjusted to strategic requirements. From its formation in June onwards, this work of the Board was seriously delayed by the failure of the United States Army to formulate its requirements related to an agreed strategic plan.The programme of requirements for the United States Army was greatly in excess of production possibilities, a state of affairs which, besides threateningseriously to reduce the volume of supplies both of finished war equipment andraw materials to Britain, resulted in the emergence of extreme unbalance of theAmerican production programme and consequent waste of resources. From the start, therefore, the Board exerted its main efforts towards impressing upon the combined Chiefs of Staff- and through them the American military authorities the need for a statement of requirements which was both linked with a strategicplan and was within the limits of production possibility.
In order to further these efforts, the Board prepared a consolidated balance sheet of the supply and requirements of the five main scarce raw materials-carbon steel, alloy steel, copper, aluminium and rubber on the basis of theexisting production programmes in the two countries. The first results ofthis investigation showed substantial deficiencies, and demonstrated theimpracticability of the programmes which were ruling in the autumn of 1942. Theeffect of this was to cause a much clearer appreciation in Washington than hitherto of the dangers of over-expanded programmes, and in October a radicalrevision was ordered to bring the United States programmes to a practical size.Mr. Lyttelton is now in Washington participating in this revision; he is there proposing certain changes in the United States programme in particular,an expansion in the merchant shipbuilding programme, and the inclusion inthat programme of a &quot; commitment &quot; for certain key supplies to Britain. Theeffect of the combined procedure and of the existence of C.P.R.B., indeed, hasbeen to enable Britain to bring pressure to bear for the adjustment of the UnitedStates production programmes.to accord both with strategic considerations andwith the resources available. It is certain that the effect of the work put intoC.P.R.B. has been to accelerate greatly this highly necessary revision of theUnited States programme. There has been little spectacular achievement in the sense of agreements, say, to produce all the fighter aircraft in United Kingdomand all the bombers in United States; but the result of the long-drawn-outpreliminary work of the Board has been to transmit British experience ofprogramming to the United States Administration, and to bring the UnitedStates Army programme to reasonable proportions. Once the overall combinedprogramme is within the range of practicability, it will be possible for combined production planning in the more detailed sense to develop.The Board was instructed in its terms of reference to take full account ofthe essential needs of the civil population; its function is to ensure that there isno waste of resources through over-lavish provision for civilian needs. In thepreparation of its balance sheet of raw materials the Board obtained information about the.quantities of material being allocated in the various countries for eachnon-military need. The Board, furthermore, asked for comprehensive reports from United States and Great Britain on the measures which had been takento cut down civilian consumption and to economise in materials. The Board is thus seeking to establish standards by which essentiality of civilian requirementscan be measured and compared. It is now developing machinery for dealingwith non-military supplies in order to ensure that the reduced resources availablefor non-military production are used in the most efficient manner.The Board has also taken action to deal with specific crucial problems. Forexample, it initiated investigations in both the United States and Britain into the rubber requirements of the two countries, the result of which was a provisionaldetermination of the best distribution of available rubber supplies between theUnited Nations; following this, a Truck Committee is now in Washington,consisting of leading production experts of the three countries, to determine how best the United Nations&apos; truck production capacity can be used in relation to requierements, shipping and other considerations. Similarly, the Board sponsoreda Steel Mission to the United Kingdom, the result of which was a determination of the British steel quota from the United States and a decision by the american authorities to adopt the British system of steel allocation. Again the Boardmade a determination of the distribution of alloy steel between the United Statesand the United Kingdom, a decision which could not be effectively made throughthe normal channels because it involved considerations of the balance ofammunition programmes in the two countries. The Board, in co-operation withthe Combined Chiefs of Staff, has taken steps to ensure that British require-ments in the United States were allotted priority ratings equivalent to thoseaccorded to American requirements of equal strategic importance.Broadly, therefore, in spite of delays which were more or less inherent inthe task which it had to undertake, the C.P.R.B. has been able to intervene in anumber of questions which the normal machinery could not handle, and in anumber of specific instances has been able to bring about the effective integration of resources. At the same time it has been successful by continuous pressure in bringing the scale of combined military production programmes into aperspective which is now yielding a revision which will bring them within the framework of feasibility.The Board operates primarily, through existing-agencies. It was neverintended to provide a large administrative machinery, but rather to provide afocal point at which effective decisions could be taken in the production field,
and from which could be initiated combined action between the appropriatenational (or other combined) agencies. The Board is linked with the combined chiefs of Staff, which appointed liaison senior officers to attend the Board&apos;smeetings. The Board is linked, too, with the Combined Munitions AssignmentBoard, which passes to it for decision cases in which the decision whether ornot a given weapon should be produced in the United States for the British orother International Aid countries depends upon production rather than strategic considerations. The Combined Shipping Adjustment Board uses C.P.R.B. asa! means of bringing shipping implications of production policy before thevarious countries&apos; production authorities; production problems arising from thedifficulty of shipping trucks have been handled in this way. The CombinedRaw Materials Board has submitted problems of raw material allocation, whichthe C.R.M.B. could not determine where strategic and general productionquestions were involved. The decisions of the Board take the form of instruc-tions and recommendations to other combined Boards or to national agencies;these are carried out less by virtue of the authority of the Board as such thanby the authority of the members of the Board as heads of the central productionagencies in their own countries; the Board is not so much a super-nationalauthority, as a link joining the central production authorities of the threemember countries.In the field of non-military supplies the machinery for tabulating . therequirements of the non-Axis world, judging their essentiality and deciding what production facilities are to be employed, to meet them is in process ofdevelopment. The C.P.R.B. will only consider major items in this connexion.Preparation of necessary data for, the British Commonwealth, except Canada,lies with London, and the Commonwealth Supply Council.has been set. up to do this work as well as to allocate between its members any bulk allotments made which are less than total requirements. Broadly, the area which Londonprogrammes is the British Commonwealth, except Canada, and the rest of theworld, except South America and China, which are an American responsibility.South America is brought in through OLLA and BEW.On special items, such as medical supplies, the appropriate committee ofthe Commonwealth Supply Council intends to invite representatives of interestsoutside the British Commonwealth to be present, for example War transport on behalf of the Middle East Supply Centre and the Inter-Allied Post-WarMedical -Requirements Committee for Allied countries which wish to make provision against their post-war needs.ANNEX.Constitution and Functions of C.P.R.B.   Announcement of November 10,1942.In view of the very close relations in the field of production already existing between Canada and the United Kingdom, and Canada and the United States,the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and thePrime Minister of Canada have jointly agreed that Canada shall become a full member of the Combined Production and Resources Board. The necessary arrangements have been made, and Mr. C. D. Howe, Canadian Minister ofMunitions and Supply, has become a Member of the Board jointly withMr. Donald Nelson, Chairman of the War Production Board, representing theUnited States, and Mr. Oliver Lyttelton, British Minister of Production,representing the United Kingdom. The text of the joint statement issued bythe President and Prime Minister of the 9th June, announcing the setting upof the Combined Production and Resources Board, has now, therefore, been revised to read as follows :  -In order to complete the organisation needed for the most effective use of the combined resources of North America (United States and Canada) and the UnitedKingdom, for the prosecution of the War there is hereby established a combined production and Resources Board.1. The Board shall consist of the Chairman of the War Production Boardrepresenting the United States, the Minister of Production representing theUnited Kingdom, and the Minister of Munitions and Supply representingCanada.
2. The Board shall-(a) Combine the production programmes of the United States, the United. Kingdom and Canada, into a single integrated programme, adjusted to the strategic requirements of the War, as indicated to the board by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, and to all relevant production factors.In this connection the Board shall take account of the need formaximum utilisation of the productive resources available to theUnited States, the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the united nations, the need to reduce demands on shipping to a minimum, andthe essential needs of the civilian populations.(Jb) In collaboration with the Combined Chiefs of Staff, assure the continuousadjustment of the combined production programme to meet changingmilitary requirements.To this end the Combined Chiefs of Staff and the Combined MunitionsAssignment Board shall keep the Combined Production and Resources Boardcurrently informed concerning Military requirements, and the Combined Produc-tion and Resources Board shall keep the Combined Chiefs of Staff and the combined Munitions Assignment Board currently informed concerning the facts and possibilities of production.To facilitate continuous operation, the members of the Board shall eachappoint a deputy, and the Board shall form a combined staff. The Board shallarrange for such conferences among United States and United Kingdom and canadian personnel as it may from time to time deem necessary or appropriate to study particular production needs, and utilise the Joint War Production Staffin London, the Combined Raw Materials Board, the Joint Aircraft Committee,and other existing combined or national agencies for war production in such manner and to such extent as it shall deem necessary.Ministry of Production,
COMBINED RAW MATERIALS BOARD.(1) Constitution.The Combined Raw Materials Board was set up in January 1942 following upon the visit of the Prime Minister to the United States.(2) Terms of Reference.The Terms of Reference of the Board are as follows : (a) To plan the best and speediest development, expansion and use of the rawmaterial resources under the jurisdiction or control of the BritishGovernment or the United States Government, and to make therecommendations necessary to execute such plans. Such recommenda-tions shall be carried out by all parts of the respective Governments.(&amp;) In collaboration with others of the United Nations, to work toward thebest utilisation of their raw material resources, and, in collaboration with the interested nation or nations, to formulate plans and recom-mendations for the development, expansion, purchase or othereffective use of their raw materials.(3) Organisation.The Board, which sits in Washington, has two members, one representing theUnited States Government and the other the British Government. Since itsinception the members have been Mr. W. Batt for the United States Governmentand Sir Clive Baillieu, who acts under the instruction of the British Minister ofProduction. The Board&apos;s Secretariat is provided by the American requirements committee and the British Raw Materials Mission (of which Sir Clive Baillieuis Head). There are two Executive Secretaries to the Board : Mr. Howard Sykesfor the United States side and Mr. G. Archer (who is also Secretary-General ofthe B.R.M.M.) for the British. In order to foster the concept of the Board as a combined undertaking, the American and British Secretariats are housed in thesame building.The Board has no counterpart in the United Kingdom; that is to say, thereis no Anglo-American raw materials committee sitting in London. The supplies and requirements of the British Empire (other than Canada) and the middle east (civil needs), are, however, collated :in London by the Raw MaterialsCommittee of the Commonwealth Supply Council (until recently known as theEmpire Clearing House) before presentation to the C.R.M.B. The interests ofCanada are represented on the Board by the United States member..(4) Activities.All raw materials come within the scope of the C.R.M.B., but in practice itconfines its operations to those where a shortage threatens to curtail war produc-tioii. Twenty-three such materials have already been fully reported on andanother twenty-five are under consideration at the present time. A material maybe brought under review by the Board at the special request of either theAmerican or the British side because their Government is experiencing difficultyin meeting its requirements of a particular material owing to the heavy demandsor unregulated purchasing of the other side&apos;s Government or nationals.As soon as it has been decided that a material must be reviewed by theBoard, a draft report is prepared by the staff on the basis of informationassembled by the American Requirements Committee for the Western Hemisphereand by the Ministry of Production in London for the Eastern Hemisphere (therehave been some exceptions to this zoning principle, but in general it applies). as has been stated in paragraph (3) above, the necessary statistics and othersupporting data for the Empire are collected and discussed by the Raw Materials.Committee of the Commonwealth Supply Council. This body is to an increasing extent able to screen effectively Empire requirements; it advises the Britishmember of the C.R.M.B. of the allocations it considers appropriate for the variousEmpire countries concerned. The requirements of the other Allied countries andneutrals in the Eastern Hemisphere are sponsored by the United Kingdom,except in the case of China, which comes within the United States sphere ofresponsibility, and Russia, allocations to whom are mainly governed by the[24698] - c &quot;
Protocol agreements, and are usually the subject of tripartite negotiations betweenthe United Kingdom, United States, and U.S.S.R. The C.R.M.B. does, however,review the allocations to Russia and may suggest modifications in them.The draft report presents a statistical picture of the position of the united nations, and on the basis of this discusses possibilities of expansion of produc-tion, economies in use, shipping economies, and so forth. After taking all these factors into account, it recommends how the available supplies should be allocated between the members of the United Nations. The allocations are usually made for quarterly periods.The draft report is first considered by the Operating Committee of theC.R.M.B. This committee is a clearing-house for any points of dispute oruncertainty which may have arisen during the preparation of the report. TheMinistry of Production in London is advised by cable, before the OperatingCommittee meets, of the recommendations made in the report and its commentsor any objections it may have to the recommendations are discussed, and, practi-cally speaking, always settled, at the Operating Committee stage. The OperatingCommittee includes, besides members of the C.R.M.B. secretariat, representativesof the United States War Production Board, the State Department, the Board ofEconomic Warfare, the Federal Loan Agency, and the British Embassy in washington.The report as amended by the Operating Committee is then considered at a formal meeting of the Board. The whole C.R.M.B. machinery is designed to-ensure close co-operation between the American and British staffs during thepreparation of the report, so as to prevent conflicts of opinion coming up for settlement before the Board itself. It has so far been very successful in this, andnormally-the Board adopts the report as it stands.In making decisions as to allocation of supplies, expansion of production, &amp;c,the Board names in each case the Government responsible for seeing that thedecision is carried out. When subsequent reviews are being prepared (aquarterly procedure in the case of most materials), reports are called for on theprogress- which has been made in implementing the decisions. As regards theRritish Government, the Ministry of Production has a general responsibility forseeing that these are carried out; the Supply Ministries (with, of course, the raw Materials Department of the Ministry of Supply) are usually the Depart-ments which must take any action which is needed. . On the United States side,the War Production Board acts in a capacity similar to that of the Ministry ofProduction. Allocation by the C.R.M.B. is accepted by O.L.L.A. as sufficient justification for requisition under Lease-Lend for supplies from the UnitedStates.In making allocations the C.R.M.B. commonly works on the principle ofearmarking particular sources to either the United Kingdom or the United states in order to simplify purchasing arrangements. Where this is not feasible, eitherone of the Governments acts as sole purchaser and resells the agreed quota to theother (e.g.; sisal from British East Africa), or, in order to avoid currencydifficulties, a co-ordinated purchasing scheme is established (e.g., balsa-wood inEcuador). In allocating sources of supply, so far as possible Western Hemispheresources are earmarked for the United States and Eastern Hemisphere for theUnited Kingdom. The same principle has been adopted in certain cases for deter-mining responsibility for supplying goods made wholly or mainly of critical rawmaterials, e.g., hard hemp goods and copper semi-manufactures.If the allocation of a material gives rise to problems of combined productionplanning in the United States and the United Kingdom, the C.R.M.B. refers tothe C.P.R.B. and a joint committee of the two Boards may be set up to considerthe material in question (e.g., steel).Ministry of Production.
COMBINED FOOD BOARD.(1) Constitution.The Combined Food Board and the Combined Production and resources board were established on the 9th June by an announcement by the PrimeMinister, on behalf of himself and President Roosevelt, &apos;&apos; in order to complete theorganisation needed for the most effective use of the combined resources of theUnited Nations and United Kingdom for the prosecution of the war.&quot; .(2) Terms of Reference.&quot; The purpose of the Board shall be to co-ordinate and obtain a planned and expeditious utilisation of the food resources of the United Nations.&apos;&apos; The duties of the Board shall be to consider, investigate, inquire into andformulate plans with regard to any question in respect of which the Governmentsof the United States and United Kingdom have, or may have, a common concernrelating to supply, production, transportation, disposal, allocation of distribution in or to any part of the world, of foods, agricultural materials from which foodsare derived, and equipment and raw materials used in the production of suchfoods, and agricultural materials, and to make recommendations to the Govern-ments of the United States and United Kingdom in respect of any such questions.&quot; To work in collaboration with others of the United Nations towards thebest utilisation of their food resources and, in collaboration with any interestedNation or Nations, to formulate plans and recommendations for development,expansion, purchase or other effective use of their food resources.&quot; The Board shall be entitled to receive from any agency of the Governmentof the United States and any department of the Government of the UnitedKingdom any information available to such agency or department relating to any matter with regard to which the Board is competent to make recommendations to those Governments and, in principle, the entire food resources of Great Britainand the United States will be deemed to be a common pool about which fullestinformation wiH,be inter-changed.&quot;     -(3) Organisation.The Combined Food Board is composed of the Secretary of Agriculture forthe United States (Mr. Claude Wickard) and the Head of the British food mission (Mr. R. H. Brand) representing, and acting under the instructions of, theMinister of Food of the United Kingdom. The Minister of Food givesinstructions on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Where the Board considersmatters affecting the agricultural production of the United Kingdom, the Ministerof Food transmits to Mr. Brand the instructions of the Minister of Agriculture.(a) Washington.The Board is located in Washington and is served by a joint Secretariat.The Secretariat is charged with (a) maintaining contact with the various United States agencies which dealwith food or food materials; and(6) creating standing or ad hoc committees to give preliminary considerationto matters falling within the terms of reference of the Board.For the purpose of (a) an Inter-Agency Committee has been established onwhich are represented the State Department, Board of Economic Warfare, Officeof Lend-Lease Administration, War Shipping Administration, War ProductionBoand (Stockpile and Shipping Division), and the British Merchant ShippingMission. The Inter-Agency Committee is the method by which matters comingbefore the Combined Food Board are cleared with the various United StatesAgencies which may be concerned.Canada is represented on the various Committees of the Secretariat, and theinterests of South American countries are indirectly represented through the-Washington State Departments. A liaison officer maintains contact with.S.S.R.&apos;s representatives in Washington. Allied Governments are not[24698] c 2
represented, their requirements being transmitted by the State Department and ministry of Food.As regards (b), the Secretariat has established Committees to deal with thefollowing questions : In Washington Oils and Fats.Meat and Meat Products.Dairy Products.Sugar.Agricultural Seeds.Spices, Cocoa and Coffee.Fertilisers.Import Programmes of the United Nations.Vitamins.Fruit and Vegetables.Agricultural and Farm Machinery.In London United Kingdom Agricultural Production.Tea.(b) London.In London, the London Food Committee has been established under theChairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food, with thefollowing membership : Australia.New Zealand.South Africa. - .Southern Rhodesia.India.United Kingdom Ministry of Food.Colonial Office. 8Dominions Office.Treasury.Foreign Office (representing the Fighting French, Belgian Congo and turkey and the interests of South America).M.W.T. (representing inter alia the Middle East Supply Centre).Board of Trade (Post-War Commodity Policy and Relief Department).United Kingdom Commercial Corporation.War Cabinet Offices (representing interests of U.S.S.R. in extra-Protocolsupplies).M.E.W. (representing the interests of European neutrals other thanTurkey).Canada may send an observer and is directly represented on the Tea Com-mittee in London. U.S.S.R. is also represented on the Tea Committee, but willnot participate directly in London activities. Allied /Governments are not represented, their requirements being transmitted by the Ministry of Food andand the State Department. There is also liaison with the Leith-Ross Inter-AlliedCommittee.The Secretariat to the London Food Committee is provided by the Ministry ofFood.The London Food Committee is the principal instrument for ensuringadequate consideration in London of matters coming before the Combined food board. It will be responsible for presenting to the Board a complete Empire(excluding Canada) and, in some cases, United Nations picture, both as regardspotential supplies and essential requirements of commodities under consideration and will also review the interests of the members in other questions of a general or particular nature which are under discussion. The Committee will normally be the sole channel of communication between the Governments represented on itand the Combined Food Board.
The London Food Committee will work through small and expert sub-committees dealing with specific questions. It is proposed to set up immediatelysub-committees on : Meat,Oils and Fats,Dairy Products,Rice,Canned Fish,Dried Fruits,and further sub-committees will be formed as needed.(4) Activities.The Board is giving primary consideration to two urgent problems (a) The equitable allocation of food-stuffs in short supply in accordance withessential needs. Allocation and co-ordinated buying schemes arealready in operation in the case of oils and fats, sugar, tea, canned fish. and South American canned meat. Urgent consideration is being given to meat, rice, dried fruits and fertilisers, as well as to certainless-important commodities.(&amp;) The economy of the ocean-going tonnage needed to convey the requiredinternational movements of food-stuffs. The Board is collecting the-forward imports programme of all the United Nations for the eighteen months the 1st July, 1942-30th December, 1943. In addition,methods of reducing the amount of refrigerated tonnage needed to meet. the United Kingdom requirements of imported meat are. being activelyinvestigated in collaboration with the Combined-Shipping AdjustmentBoardMinistry of Food.
COMBINED SHIPPING ADJUSTMENT BOAEDS.(1) Constitution.The Combined Shipping Adjustment Boards in London and Washingtonwere set up by a decision of the Prime Minister and the President of the UnitedStates on 10th January, 1942.(2) Terms of Reference.The terms of reference of the Board are : , 1. In principle, the shipping resources of the two countries will be deemedto be pooled.  The fullest information will be interchanged.2. Owing to the military and physical facts of the situation around theBritish Isles, the entire movement of shipping now under the controlof Great Britain will continue to be directed by the Ministry of war transport. ,3. Similarly, the appropriate authority in the United States will continueto direct the movements and allocations of United States shipping,or shipping of other Powers under United States control.4. In order to adjust and concert in one harmonious policy the work of theBritish Ministry of War Transport and the Shipping authorities ofthe United States Government, there will be established forthwith in washington a Combined Shipping Adjustment Board, consisting ofa representative of the United States and a representative of theBritish Government, who will represent and act under the instruc-&apos; tions of the British Minister of War Transport.5. A similar Adjustment Board will be set up in London, consisting of theMinister of War Transport and a representative of the United StatesGovernment.6. In both cases the executive power will be exercised solely by the appro-priate shipping agency in Washington and by the Minister of war transport in London.(3) Organisation.The London Board consists of : United Kingdom. United States.Members Lord Leathers, Mr. W. A.&apos; Harriman.Minister of War Transport.Advisers Sir Cyril Hurcomb. Mr. Philip Reed.Mr. T. G. Jenkins. . Mr. A. C. Kerr.Mr. E. M. Nicholson. Commander Jackson, U.S.N.Secretariat :Mr. F. A. Griffiths. Mr. W. G. Brown.Mr. L. H. Macklin.The Washington Board consists of : Members -Sir Arthur Salter. Admiral Emory S. Land.A dvisers Mr. J. S. Maclay. Mr. L. W. Douglas.Mr. D. F. Anderson. Mr. D. F. Houlihan.Executive Officers Mr.. W. O. Hart. Mr. D. E. Scoll.Secretariat Mr. W. O&apos;. Hart. Mr. W. C. Peet, Jr^The Boards have appointed as Joint Economic Analysts, Professor HenryClay and Mr. Stacy May. They will work in London and/or Washington as circumstances may require.
(4) Activities.In principle, the shipping resources under British and United States control are deemed to be pooled, but executive power is exercised solely from Londonover British-controlled tonnage, and from Washington over American-controlledtonnage. The chief tasks of the Boards are, therefore, (a) to ensure by fullexchange of information that executive action on both sides of the Atlanticis based on an agreed and accurate appreciation of the world shipping problem;(6) to bring together the thought of both controlling centres so that similar casesmay be decided on similar lines, and similar problems may, where necessary, be handled through similar mechanisms; and (c) to ensure that world shippingresponsibilities may be performed by one or other Board (or by both in concert)with a minimum of gaps on the one hand or of overlapping on the other.The task of exchanging information involves the preparation and generaladoption of regular, full, and accurate returns showing the amount, losses, gains,control, and employment of each class of tonnage, regular advance programmes ofthe various claims on tonnage, and regular returns of the fulfilment of these programmes. The general lines of these common statistics are indicated inC.S.A.B. (L) (42) 61 and 62. Combined returns are gradually becoming availableover the whole field, and provide the foundation for combined shipping policy.The task of bringing together the policies of both controlling centres isperformed by constant contact between the M.W.T. and W.S.A. representatives in London and Washington, which supplements the formal Board meetings.Routeing of shipping correspondence between the Ministry and the british merchant Shipping Mission, Washington, through the British side of the BoardSecretariat ensures co-ordinated action in accordance with Board decisions. Thegreat bulk of this correspondence is in a series which is circulated to the HarrimanMission as well as within the Ministry. The Boards have recently established the principle of joint field investigation by sending out a Combined Mission to study port problems in certain critical areas, chiefly within the Indian Ocean,and to promote common action.The task of demarcation and the making of specific adjustments are thesubject of a number of standing agreements, such as those governing the respectiveprogramming responsibilities of London and Washington and the regular UnitedStates allocation in aid of Indian Ocean sailings. Particular requests for helpare passed by one Board to another as they arise, and in certain cases, such asthe meat switch from Australasia to North America, other Boards are involved.At present the London Board meets fortnightly and the Washington Boardweekly. Up to the end of October, 1942, the. London Board had met 15 times and the Washington Board 36 times. During the earlier part of the year theW.S.A. was largely engaged in expanding on to a war footing, and theWashington Board provided a useful mechanism for making British experienceavailable to the United States shipping authorities.The London Board has no formal committees, but has taken the initiative in action leading to the setting-up of the Shipping Space Economies Committeeand the Programmes and Fulfilment (Returns) Committee, which report to it.United States representatives also attend a number of committees of common interest within the Ministry of War Transport.No other United Nations are represented on the Boards, although there is&apos;provision for consulting them on matters of direct concern. In London, inaddition to the Combined Board, there are Anglo-Soviet, Anglo-Norwegian,Anglo-Netherlands, Anglo-French, Anglo-Belgian, Anglo-Greek, and Anglo-Yugoslav Shipping Committees, which provide opportunity for the discussionof problems of interest to each of the other maritime allies. There is a UnitedStates representative on the Anglo-Soviet Committee, and on the Anglo-Netherlands Committee when the allocation of Netherlands ships under thecontrol of the Boards jointly is discussed. There is no general inter-allied bodyconcerned &quot;with Shipping.Ministry of War Transport.
