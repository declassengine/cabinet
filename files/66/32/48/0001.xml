(42) 618.December 31, 1942. /jHWAR CABINET.CHURCH HOUSE, WESTMINSTER: ACCOMMODATION FOR the communications EQUIPMENT BRANCH OF THE MINISTRYOF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.FOLLOWING- upon the establishment of the Radio Board (W.P. (42) 415(Revise)), the Minister of Aircraft Production has expressed a wish to bring his communications Equipment Branch into closer touch with the Headquarters ofhis Department. He states that experience has shown that their presentaccommodation at Oakwood Court, Kensington, is too remote to permit of easycontact.2. I have discussed this matter with the Minister of Works and Planning,who informs me that the only building near the Ministry of Aircraft production which is suitable for this purpose is Church House. The War Cabinet will recall(W.M. (40) 272nd Conclusions, Minute 10, and 279th Conclusions, Minute 8) thatChurch House was requisitioned in October 1940 to serve as an alternative meetingplace for Parliament. It was then adapted and furnished for this purpose at aninclusive cost of  68,000; the total area is approximately 85,000 square feetexcluding the two Chambers, which total 4,000 square feet. It is at presentunused except for a limited number of rooms, which are occupied by the ChiefWhips and the Central Statistical Office.3. The Minister of Works and Planning considers that there is no objectionto the.occupation of Church House by the Communications Equipment Branch ofthe Ministry of Aircraft Production, provided that the Minister of aircraft production is prepared to give the following undertakings : *(a) That he will move the Staff of the Communications Equipment Branchout immediately, should Church House ever be required for thepurposes of Parliament;&quot;(b) That the special fittings and layout required for Parliament will notbe altered so as to make it difficult to use the building at short noticefor Parliamentary purposes; and(c) That the occupation of the Chief Whips and the Central Statistical office will not be disturbed (though this does not necessarily rule outreallocation of space). - -4. The Minister of Aircraft Production is prepared to give these under-takings. In these circumstances, I have authorised the Minister of Works and planning to proceed with this move. In view, however, of the purpose for whichChurch House was requisitioned, I have thought it advisable to bring the matter to the notice of my colleagues.5. I should perhaps add that the Park Lane Hotel constitutes anotherstandby for Parliament and could be made available as an alternative meetingplace at some ten days&apos; notice, subject to completion of certain building detailsat a later date.J. A.Privy Council Office,Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 31, 1942.
