THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.SECEET. .W.P. (42) 591.December 16, 1942.WAR CABINET.MY AMERICAN VISIT-SOME RANDOM NOTES.By the Minister of Production.THE following rather random notes are put down more in the hope thatthey may be of interest to my colleagues than that they should accept them asparticularly well informed. I was engaged upon a specific task; I did not go outof my way to follow the political changes or survey the American scene. I sawMr. Hopkins almost every day, and I had a number of very long conversations with the President. He asked me not to commit most of these conversations to paper, and I shall accordingly report them orally to the Prime Minister and tothe Foreign Secretary.Political:I arrived the day after the Election. It is not to be doubted that thePresident will have considerable troubles with Congress. From what I heard in several Republican quarters, his first difficulties are likely to be with labourlegislation; the Right-wing Democrats may combine with the Republicans in proposing drastic legislation concerning labour. Again, there is generalconcern shared both by Democrats and Republicans about the alleged incom-competence of the Government machine. A Bill in draft standing in the name of representative Tolan, and now being considered by a Committee of Congress,aims at setting up an Office of War Mobilisation to bring procurement,production, man-power, research and invention and economic stabilisation undera central control. Though this was a grandiloquent scheme, there was much that was sound in the proposals in the Bill as applied to present conditions in washington.The President outwardly appeared to be not in the least perturbed by theresults of the Flections, and said to me that to have carried Congress on sixsuccessive occasions was a remarkable feat. The Election is supposed to havebeen fought almost entirely on domestic issues, and this can be accepted as generally true. The small size of the vote is adduced as part evidence of this.My own view is that the swing over was due to the prosperity and boomconditions which prevail. Any party whose support comes largely from the under-dog suffers when there are no under-dogs. I think, however, it is most unwise to predict as confidently as most Republicans appear to do, that thenext President will be a Republican. The circumstances in which the 1944Elections will take place cannot be foreseen. If the war has just been won, oris clearly coming rapidly to an end, I believe it quite possible that the Presidentmight run for a fourth term, and if he does so we may well say once more in1944 that nobody voted for Roosevelt except the people.I do not suppose that there can be any serious question that British interests are far less likely to suffer under a Democratic than under a Republican regime.The weapons put into the hands of the United States, for instance by Lend/Lease,by tl^e possession of a Mercantile Marine far larger than our own and by the almost complete loss of our export trade and our foreign investments are indeedpowerful, but we can be assured that they will be used in a very broad-mindedway by Mr. Roosevelt if he is President, or by men of the kidney of Mr. Wallace.No such confidence can be felt that this attitude would be that of the republicans. Against this, the dangers of a school-marm-ish and sloppy policy by the Democrats towards the British Empire, India and other internationalsubjects, though they cannot be ignored, are likely to be tempered by politicalnecessities. Some British observers contrive to be alarmed at one and the sametime by American imperialism and by fears of her cutting herself adrift from therest of the world. Both cannot be dangers at once. But of the two, whether[24772] - copy No.
under a Republican or a Democratic regime, the second, in my view, looms much the larger. That is not to say that the almost fanatical idealism of Mr. Wallacedoes not make my Tory blood run cold. It does. But his hypothesis that allAmerican and British citizens are, by the nature of things, more reprehensiblehuman beings than Chinamen or Argentines will not receive much support from either Americans or Britons.Economic.Economically, unmistakable signs of inflation are already discernible. Thesystem of appropriations by Congress cannot be compared with our own systemof Government finance, but nevertheless both the sums asked for and those grantedare of such a size that they compel a new outlook on American economy and,indeed, upon the whole subject of international exchange. As I said in a previouspaper, the appropriations asked for by the Services alone amounted to 224 billiondollars, a sum so colossal that it only conveys something to the imagination if weremember that the peak level reached by the British National Debt after the last war was no more than 38 billion dollars at par. The best estimates are that theUnited States will actually spend about 60 billion dollars in 1942, and perhaps85 billion dollars in 1943, upon Government account. Our present rate ofGovernment spending is about 21 billion dollars a year.The measures to take the new purchasing power out of the market, to securefair distribution and to control prices are rudimentary compared with our own and I doubt, if they were perfected, that they could be administered. I might,perhaps, give a homely illustration of the kind of thing that is happening. Thefacts, which come from a reliable source, were given to Sir Walter Layton. Anold. servant gave notice. She said she had to go and look after her daughterschildren, and in the circumstances of their family had no need to earn money.Her son-in-law, an enlisted man, was in East Africa; he was remitting 91 dollarsper week out of his pay and allowances, and her daughter had accepted a .pbstas secretary, which probably bi&apos;ought in 40-50 dollars per week.It is quite clear that there is a great deal of superfluous fat on the civilianbody. Almost the only noticeable signs of a war economy are in the rationing of petrol which, though not nearly as severe as our own, has a very great effect in the United States, because the motor car is there not far from a necessity. Thefaint beginnings of the rationing of coffee and sugar are discernible, but thereis profusion of almost everything else, and, for instance, to British eyes the sunday edition of the New York Times, with more than 250 pages of readingmatter, and weighing approximately 4 lbs., seems strangely anomalous. Theconsumption of newsprint in the United States amounted in 1941 to little lessthan 4 million tons and is now at about the same level. This compares with aconsumption of 246,000 tons per annum in this country.A administrative.The central direction of the Government machine is not a model of adminis-trative efficiency. Quite apart from the fact that the American Constitution illadapts the Government for carrying on war, there are many simple things whichcould be done to improve the central direction. The Secretariat at the WhiteHouse appears to the outsider to be quite unequal to the task of sifting themultitudinous subjects which must be presented every day to the President for decision, either in his capacity as the Head of the State or as Commander-in-Chief. The Secretaries of the War Department and the Navy Department aremere cyphers, and once or twice in my experience they have learned of militarymoves and military subjects of quite a routine nature from British officers. ThePresident consults Admiral King and General Marshall, without any referenceto the Departments. A very large number of agencies acting under Presidentialdirectives with ill-defined or expressed frontiers of authority have been createdto deal with war problems. There are said to be 24-*different Government agenciesdealing with food, and I was told that even a single metal like copper is controlled by five different agencies.But if an observer is inclined to despair of administrative efficiency everbeing reached, I think he can console himself with the fact that the president and Mr. Hopkins seem&apos; to get the big things right. For example, the Lepd-Leasepolicy is a monument of foresight, political sagacity and consummate manage-ment. It has now become so familiar a feature of the war that it is difficult toimagine where we would be without the Lend-Lease help. A more recent instanceis afforded by the way in which the President has cut back the size of the armed forces and of production to equip them to a realistic figure.
Controversy between the W.P.B. and the Services.During the whole of my visit, Washington was torn by an inter-departmentalbattle of the greatest severity and, in its closing phases, of the greatest bitterness.This was a battle between the War Production Board and the American Services.Production in certain fields, particularly in that of aircraft, has been disappointing.The policy, which was even advocated in this country at one time, of puttingin control of various raw materials and various industries those who have no connection with them a policy dictated by the fear that vested interests would serve their own purposes has proved a great bar to efficiency. It has led, in itsturn, to vast over-centralisation, and it is said on very good authority thatthere are no fewer than 635,000 persons engaged in the central administration, orin the central agencies. For example, the Automotive Section of the W.P.B.,which covers in the main only tanks and trucks, has a Head Office staff of 5,800in Detroit alone.The system under which production was operating was, that the Servicesestimated their requirements, placed the orders with the industries concerned andscheduled the programme. It is necessary to observe that the placing of orders and scheduling, if properly carried out, are one of the most difficult and technicalparts of the whole function of production. The allotment of raw materials andthe enforcement of priorities were the functions of W.P.B., though the responsi-bility for what went on in the factories was never clearly defined. Infuriated bythe muddle, and with a simplicity which is not always divorced from the militarymind, the Services determined that the only solution of the problem was to takeover the whole machinery of production themselves. It will hardly appearcredible, but I was asked privately to advise upon this suggestion.I made all the obvious criticisms from the administrative point of view ofany such system, and asked who was to decide between the conflicting demandsof the Army and Navy; but I also pointed out that it was impossible to segregatethe manufacture of munitions from the manufacture of goods for essentialcivilian requirements. As the war went on, limitation of supply, concentration of industry upon which they have already started and for which they have adopted our methods rationing and various other measures which would affectthe life of every citizen of the United States would become increasingly necessary.In a democracy the citizens were not going to accept these restrictions if theywere imposed at the dictates of a General, even though he was working underthe authority of the Commander-in-Chief, who happens to be the same person asthe President.The struggle is now thought to be over, and as the first essay in the exerciseof the powers which the W.P.B. has always had, but has not used, the whole ofthe aircraft industry is being put directly under Mr. Charles Wilson of the W.P.B.Mr. Wilson, lately President of the General Electric Company, is probablyamongst the three or four best industrialists in the United States. That partof the Service personnel of the Air Corps concerned with production is now under his orders. I think he will build up and achieve an orderly programme for theproduction of aircraft.It is necessary to temper these criticisms of production by pointing to thesolid achievements of the United States. A comparison between the first12 months of war by the United States in 1941-42 and the first 12 months of warin 1939-40 by the British Empire is greatly obscured by such influences as thatof the British and French orders for munitions; nevertheless, we started rearming,or making preparations to rearm, in 1938, and the following figures cannot bebrushed aside : United States and United Kingdom Production.

&quot;Combined Boards.I must say a word about the Combined Boards. Considering the difficultiesunder which they labour, they are becoming an effective instrument of Combinedpolicy, but what is completely lacking is the necessary impulse from the combined chiefs of Staff. Even the Joint American Chiefs of Staff hardly work as a team,and the joke which is bandied about Washington that General Marshall read ofthe Solomons expedition only in the newspapers is too near the truth to be repeated by a foreigner. However, the Navy Department and the War Depart-ment are now, if not married, at least co-habiting in the Pentagon Building, avast new office block into which a stranger, if he is wise, ventures only with acompass and iron ration. Whilst it is obvious that the higher strategy must be framed by the President and the Prime Minister, there are nevertheless amuitidude of subjects upon which the Combined Chiefs of Staff should enunciatea Combined policy to carry out that major strategy.It is widely assumed that these combined bodies may play a role in Anglo-American, possibly even in more widespread international, co-operation after thewar. Some think that they afford a golden opportunity to build up over a wide field a structure of common Government which will, in due course, include other nations and so provide skeleton machinery for post-war international organisation. Others hold that after the war Great Britain and the UnitedStates will more easily co-operate for specific practical jobs than in a generalscheme of international policy and that the chief merit of these bodies is thatthey have strictly limited aims and are confined to the two nations. These arecomplex matters and a false step cannot easily be re-traced. The wise course is to make haste slowly, to profit by the practice and experience of co-operation,but not to extend either the scope or the functions of these bodies for ulteriorreasons beyond those dictated by the severely practical necessities of warorganisation.Mr. Hoover&apos;s views.I saw Mr. Hoover at his own request. He made no comments about thegeneral policy being pursued in the war by the President, but confined his criticismto the working of the machine, which he thought deplorable. He said that thevigour and virility of American industry was being sapped and retarded by administrative incompetence in Washington. Industry would achieve theproduction, in spite of what happened at the centre; but it would achieve it muchlater than it would have done if responsibility had been properly devolved uponindustries themselves. He said that they were obtaining a good production atthe end of the last war with less than one-sixth of the central staff which was now engaged upon it. He complained bitterly of ignorant New Dealers controllingindustries of which they had no knowledge.Mr. Hoover said that the Election had shown how great were the conservativeforces in the United States. He himself had, of course, been against the UnitedStates becoming involved in the war, but now that they were in it, he wishedto put every ounce of American power behind it. He considered and this view was shared by all the conservative elements (I use his own words) in the republican party that the closest possible co-operations between the BritishCommonwealth and the United States must be maintained now and after thewar They were frightened that if they did not act at one with the BritishEmpire, Russia would make &quot; the way of life for which we stand &quot; impossible.He said that both the sorties of the Archbishop of Canterbury into temporalfields and the doctrines of Mr. Laski, freely promulgated in the United States,had done immense harm. He told me that I should see over the next few monthsa campaign, which I suspect to be backed by very large sums of money, infavour of Anglo-American co-operation. This campaign would be conductedhy indirect methods, but would carry behind it the whole force of the Republicanmachine. Mr. Hoover considered that Mr. Willkie had cooked himself or hisgoose and he would have thought that the two phrases were synonymous by is recent speeches. Nothing could be more disagreeable to the conservativeRepublicans than vociferous statements that Russia had been let down and thatthe British Empire was an&quot;obstacle in the path of freedom and progress; suchstatements affronted Republican opinion on the two topics upon which it was most sensitive. He urged that more Republicans should be invited to Englandand that we should not give the impression that America and the Democraticadministration were in our minds the same thing.   &apos;-It is, of course, a platitude that Mr. Willkie is most unlikely to get the republican ticket, and I think he is lashing out in order to try and gain the
intermediate vote, so that if possible he may be elected without the Republicanmachine. His hopes, I believe, will not be realised. Mr. Hoover did notconsider that anti-British feeling Went very deep into the country. He thoughtthat it could not be ignored, and that we were ill-advised not to try and informAmerican public opinion more about the nature of the British Empire. this need.. not take the form of propaganda, but might be confined to factualpresentation.It is very noticeable that American industry devotes a good part of itsattention to post-war trade. Sir William Rootes saw the new models of theFord Motor Company all ready to pass into production when the war ended, andI fear that I cannot escape the conclusion that the aircraft industry, a.nd inparticular Pan American Airways, are largely engaged in preparing for post-war Civil Aviation.&apos;&apos; The Flag.&apos;&apos; question.I must report the general tenor of a conversation which T had with thePresident on the last day when I was in Washington, concerning the transfer toour flag of merchant shipping. I had heard from Mr. Hopkins that the president was forming some ideas in his mind on this very difficult subject, and accordinglyI asked him whether he was willing to give them to me. The President was clearly not prepared to discuss the subject as a war measure, and turned at once to post-war aspects. He said that we should first seize all the Axis-controlled shipping and put it into a pool. A calculation should, be made of the percentage of worldtonnage under the control of each of the United Nations before the war, and adistribution made from the total pool, which would, of course, include american and British tonnage, towards the restoration of the pre-war percentages. Hecited as instances the Greeks and Norwegians. Say, that the Greeks had had8 per cent, of the world tonnage, and were left with, perhaps, 3 per cent, at theend of the war; they would be first allotted Axis ships and then would have theright to buy American or British ships, at their depreciated value, and pay forthem by instalments spread over a long time, without interest. They might get inthis way, he said, up to perhaps 6 per cent. I remarked that I was afraid that theBritish Empire would fall into the same category as the Greeks in respect of ships,and asked him whether he accepted that, under this arrangement, the BritishMercantile Marine might be larger than the American. He did not appear torecoil from this, but said that the system must be worked out and that the Axistonnage would help.  I naturally replied that the idea was a most generous one.In conclusion, I must say that, although the above remarks appear critical,I left the United States with the same admiration I have always felt for the vigourand liveliness of the people, and with the feeling that, although their purposes areobscured here and there by cross-currents, they are very determined to have done with this war, and all wars, once and for all. I.expect that the American people will regard unconditional surrender as the only peace terms to which they wouldsubscribe.O. L.December 16, 1942.
