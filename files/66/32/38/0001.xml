On the 18th H.M. Destroyer Partridge was torpedoed and sunk off. Oran.Six Officers and 167 ratings were rescued. On the following day TIM. CorvetteSnapdragon was bombed and sunk off Benghazi. There were 60 survivors. Onthe night of the 20th/21st a 2,000 ton ship, which was located by aircraftwassunk by HM. Destroyers /ervis and Nubian, off the east coast of Tunisia.6.   The following attacks have been reported by H.M. Submarines : P. 228, on patrol off Bizerta, torpedoed a ship on the 14th and sank a destroyer and torpedoed another ship on the 17th. P. 212 sank a southboundship and possibly a second on the 14th.

P. 54, on patrol off the south coast of France,damaged a 4,000 ton ship by gunfire.7.   H.M. Submarine P. 222 is overdue from patrol and is presumed lost.Black Sea.8.   A transport of 8,000 tons has been sunk by a Russian warship.Pacific.New Zealand.9. On the 19th, H.M.N.Z.S. South Seas (auxiliary minesweeper) sank in collision in Wellington Harbour.New Guinea.10.   A Japanese light cruiser was sunk by Allied aircraft on the 18th.Far East.11. It is reported that U.S. submarines operating in the Pacific and far Eastern waters have recently sunk two tankers, three cargo ships, onetransport and a trawler.
Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Four attacks by aircraft and three by surface craft have been carriedout.   In no case was there definite evidence of destruction.During the week ending 20th, 45 attacks have been carried out by ships and aircraft operating from the United States. On the 14th a U-boat was probably damaged in an attack by U.S. aircraft off Natal (Brazil), and on the18th another U.S. aircraft made a promising attack.Enemy Intelligence.German.13.   There is no change in the disposition of the German Fleet.Italian.14. The two 8&quot; cruisers, which had not been located after leavingMessina, were found by reconnaissance at Maddalena (northern Sardinia) onthe 18th.U-boats.15.   Activity persists on the N. Atlantic convoy routes.A number of U-boats are operating off the Portuguese coast, off the east coast of Brazil and in the Trinidad-Guiana area. The total number operating in the atlantic is estimated at 95.The threat to the Capetown area is diminishing. A small number of german-boats is again operating in the Eastern Mediterranean.16. In order to keep pace with manning requirements the length of courses for U-boat officers and ratings has been much reduced. In consequence thestandard of efficiency has gone down but morale remains high.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During the week ending 21st/22nd, 603 ships have been convoyed. Ofthese, 49 were in ocean convoys and 554 in British coastal convoys. Fifty-ninedestroyers (including five U.S. destroyers) and 66 cutters and corvettes (including one U.S. cutter) were employed on escort duties.18. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 19th totalled 321,000 tons, compared with 184,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 498,700 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 129,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked four ships, ofwhich two are known to have sunk.A convoy bound for North African ports with troops and supplies from theUnited Kingdom was attacked in the Mediterranean; the transportStrathallan (23,722 tons), which was torpedoed north of Oran, subsequently sankwhile in tow with small loss of life. A ship in homeward convoy from theMediterranean was sunk west of Finisterre. Two convoys bound from the UnitedKingdom to Canada were, attacked in mid-Atlantic, and one ship in each was torpedoed.The transport Cameronia (16,297 tons) was torpedoed by aircraft north ofBougie but reached port.A ship was sunk at Benghazi by air attack, and a small vessel was sunk,probably by mine, off the Welsh coast.British Minelaying.20. Aircraft laid mines in the Baltic and Bay of Biscay, but bad weatherhas hampered these operations.In the Mediterranean minelaying by aircraft has been carried out off the coasts of Tunisia and Tripolitania.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.. 21. No minelaying by surface craft has been reported during the week, andminelaying by aircraft off the East Coast has&apos;been on a small scale.&quot;[24809] &apos; c
Recent gales have caused shallow laid enemy mines in the English Channelto drag considerably and many have broken adrift. A number of floating mines have been reported off Poole and the Needles.Forty-four mines have been destroyed off the. North Foreland.An auxiliary sailing barge was mined and sunk in the Thames Estuary onthe 19th.The mine totals, which have needed some adjustment this week owing to areport from North Russia, are : acoustic 1.325, magnetic 2,748, and moored 1,947.Foreign Waters.22. The Russians have announced that the waters within 15 miles ofGape Kanin, at the eastern entrance of the White Sea, are dangerous owing to enemy mines laid in November.Enemy Merchant Shipping.23. The German ss. Altenfels (8,123 tons) is reported to have been diverted from the Norwegian trade to the Lulea-Bremen ore route.The German ss. Leesee (2,624 tons), previously engaged in the Bilbao-Bayonne ore trade, passed through the Dover Strait on the 13th and was reported at Dunkirk on the 20th.Swedish Iron Exports and the Enemy Shipping position in Northern Waters.24. Total exports of Swedish iron ore to German Europe fell from1,125^000 tons in September to 878,000 tons in October, increasing the deficit for january/0&apos;october, as compared with the corresponding period in 1941, to925,000 tons. This decline has taken place in spite of increased exports from narvik which rose steadily from 85,000 tons per month in June to 166,000 tonsin September before dropping to 124,000 tons in October. If this progressivedecline in gross exports continues until Lulea, the main port of shipment, becomesicebound at the end of December, this deficit, with the inclusion of 50,000 tonsof ore estimated to have been lost in transit, may reach 1,050,000/1,150,000 tonsby the end of the year.It is likely that the enemy will endeavour to make good this deficit by increased shipments from other Scandinavian ports and particularly from Narvikduring the coming winter months.It is estimated that by employing vessels released from the Baltic duringthe freezing of the Bothnian ports, and suitable tonnage which has recently been withdrawn from the Bay of Biscay, the enemy could ship 200,000 tons of oreper month from Narvik.25. There is increasing evidence that the enemy are short of shipping dueto the combination of the following factors : (a) The immobilisation of suitable diesel cargo vessels, most probably through lack of fuel;(&amp;) A decline in the enemy&apos;s resources of ships between 3,000 and 8,000 tons;(c) Crew difficulties and a shortage of ships&apos; officers;(d) The recent large amount of Swedish shipping, formerly engaged incarrying iron-one, diverted to the transfer of coal from Germany. -; ; There have been several indications in the last few months that the enemyis turning from the employment of diesel-driven to coal-burning shipping.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map, showing operations in Russia, is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Central Sector.26. The Russians continue their offensive operations west of Moscow, withthe Germans counter-attacking vigorously. The German claim, however, to haveannihilated an encircled Russian force south-east of Toropets is not confirmed,and there appear to have been no major territorial changes.
Middle Don Sector.27. On the 19th the Russians announced that, south of Pavlovsk, they hadlaunched a fresh offensive across the Don, on a 50-mile front, and in an area heldmainly by Italian forces. Their attack has effected a wide and deep penetration-tion, having cut the lateral railway Svoboda-Rostov at Kantemirovka, and captured in that area the towns of Nikolskoe and Morozovka, 15 miles to thesouth. Further to the south-west it has reached the line of the Upper KalitvaRiver at a point some 20 miles from Millerovo and 70 miles from the junctionof Likhaya, on the main German supply route to the Don bend.A subsidiary Russian thrust westward across the River Chir, in the areaof Bokovskaya, has penetrated a distance of some 20 miles and has reached, among other localities, the town of Kamenka, 17 miles north-west of Bokovskaya.Stalingrad Sector.28. In their efforts to relieve the forces encircled between the Don and theYolga, the Germans have made progress in two directions. First, they havepushed some small distance eastwards of the Don at the point where it is joined by the River Chir. Secondly, their attack from the Kotelnikov area in a north-north-easterly direction has reached the line of the River Aksai. russian resistance, however, is very stubborn.Caucasus Sector.29. The Germans remain on the defensive both in the Terek Sector and north of Tuapse.  In the latter area they may have conceded some ground.Summary.30. The new Russian offensive appears to have been launched at a mostopportune moment when German reserves had presumably already been committed in the counter-offensive which had just started towards Stalingrad with the objectof freeing the entrapped Sixth Army.  .The Germans cannot ignore such a deep penetration on their flank, whichhas already cut the railway used to supply their troops in the Svoboda area andwhich aims both at the important railway junction of Millerovo and the muchmore important one at Likhaya. Through the latter place.passes the only railwayavailable for maintenance of the Axis forces in the Don bend.Tunisia.- 31. There have only been minor changes in the disposition of our forces during the last week. The centre of communications at Medjez El Bab remainsecurely held.Activity on the whole front has been confined to patrolling by armoured and infantry detachments. From time to time isolated skirmishes with the enemyhave taken place.French forces are operating effectively on our southern flank, particularlyin the areas of Kairouan, Pichon and Gafsa.A good use has been made of the lull in operations to bring up reinforce-ments and generally improve the lines of communication which are long, andhave been severely strained as a result of the very poor state of the railways.Libya.32.   The enemy has continued to withdraw throughout the week.On the 16th, the enemy troops which had been cut off. began to withdrawand suffered casualties in trying to break through our positions. Confusedfighting took place 15 miles west of Marble Arch where the enemy sufferedfurther casualties. Our armoured forces continued westwards in spite of mines and craters, and our infantry reported that the main road was clear to 10 miles west of El Agheila.From midday the 17th, our armour and infantry engaged the enemy in theNofilia area inflicting casualties and taking prisoners, and by the evening the armoured formations were still fighting south-west of the village,- while the infantry had advanced 10 miles north-west of Nofiiia and were engaging an enemyflank guard which was covering the withdrawal from the village. By nightfall,while there still remained some enemy in and around the village,; there was a[24809] - &apos; &apos; c 2
great deal of movement and many vehicles travelling westwards. In the backareas it was reported that the coast road was clear of obstructions as far asMarble Arch.Early on the 18th, Nofilia had been evacuated by the enemy, who continuedto withdraw westwards, and by that afternoon they were west of Sultan.Our flanking force continued to advance to within 25 miles of the town.The enemy continued to withdraw on the 19th, followed by our forces whichhad reached a line 30 miles west of Nofilia by evening. Meanwhile our infantrycontinued to clear mines from landing grounds 2,000 mines being cleared fromMarble Arch area alone.On the 20th, our forward infantry and armoured cars were patrolling a linerunning from seven miles west of Sultan to 15 miles S.S.E. of Sultan. The enemycontinued his retreat during the 21st, covering the coastal area Buerat-Sirte.From the 20th to the 22nd, there had been no contact with the enemy, whocontinued to retire westward.Far Bast.Burma.33. On the night of the 15th-16th the Japanese withdrew from preparedpositions in the Maungdaw-Buthidaung area (approximately 60 miles north ofAkyab).Our forward elements have now reached Alethangyaw some 11 miles south ofthese positions without encountering any opposition.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.34. Allied troops, having been reinforced by General Stuart tanks of an australian tank unit, have made further progress against the Japanese,surrounded east and west of Buna, who are now estimated to number 2,500.The enemy force landed at the mouth of the Amboga River, 16 miles north-west of Buna, which now numbers approximately 200, is withdrawing westwards.Japanese landings took place on the 18th at Finschaven, Madang and Wewak.From the composition of the respective convoys it is estimated that they mayhave landed 300 at Finschaven, 1,000 at Madang and 500 at Wewak.Solomons.35. The estimated Japanese strength on Guadalcanal is now reduced to10,000-15,000.AIR SITUATION.General.36. By night, a strong force of our bombers raided Duisburg and, by day,Romilly-sur-Seine was attacked by U.S. aircraft.United Kingdom.37. The enemy continued, on the same scale as last week, his policy of minor raids in daylight on districts near our coasts. Nine fighter-bombers were destroyed out of 41 plotted overland; we lost one aircraft on interception.Activity at night took place on only two occasions, when about seven bombersoperated over parts of Yorkshire.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.38. The only large-scale operation was the despatch of 101 U.S. heavy bombers to attack the airfield and air-park at Romilly-sur-Seine. In spite of strong enemy fighter opposition, 71 aircraft attacked and these dropped 145 tonsof H.E. and incendiaries. Many hits were made on enemy aircraft on the ground and on buildings, including a hangar which was destroyed. In combat, the bombers destroyed 45 enemy fighters, probably destroyed 25, and damaged afurther five. Six fortresses were lost. Fighter escort and support were supplied by 16 squadrons of Spitfires and, in addition, four diversionary sweeps were flown; these were uneventful.
The dock areas at Den Helder and St. Malo were successfully attacked in good visibility by escorted Venturas and Bostons respectively. At the former,bursts straddled the torpedo workshops, the naval barracks and the naval basinarea, whilst at St. Malo, apart from many bursts in the docks, one bomb fell insome earthworks and resulted in a particularly large explosion which threwdebris over a large part of the target area.In north-west Germany, a number of railway objectives were attacked byMosquitos, and Wellingtons bombed the town of Emden.Harassing attacks on transport objectives in the Low Countries and northern france were continued; at least 13 locomotives and six tugs were either destroyed or damaged and successful bombing attacks were made on the railway centres atRosendaal, Ghent, and Courtrai.Night.39. A heavy and successful attack on Duisburg was made in cloudlessweather and bright moonlight. Of the 232 aircraft despatched, 85 per cent,attacked and a total of 514 tons of H.E. and incendiaries was dropped. A great number of fires was reported, some being very large, with particularly goodconcentrations in the centre of the town, the dock area and just north of therailway centre.A smaller force, 137 aircraft, was despatched against Munich. The same percentage attacked as at Duisburg and these dropped 240 tons of H.E. andincendiaries. After experiencing good weather en route, a low cloud belt was encountered over the town but, fortunately, the Wurm See about 15 miles to thesouth-west had been clearly illuminated by flares and most aircraft made a directrun from this point. Apart from fires and one large explosion seen through cloud,no definite results could be observed.Small numbers of medium and heavy bombers attacked several targets in north-west Germany, including the Opel works at Fallersleben and objectivesat Soltau and between Bremen and Osnabruck, but, as at Munich, a low cloudbase prevented the observation of results.In the Ruhr area, Mosquitos attached Hamborn, Rheinhausen, Essen and -Kaiserswerth and, in Holland, the Lutterade power station near Sittard.From these operations, 40 bombers are missing and four crashed in thiscountry.Forty, seven Intruder sorties were flown and successful results includedattacks on at least 38 locomotives and goods trains.Propaganda leaflets were dropped over Nantes, Vichy, Orleans and townsin north-west France and Belgium.Coastal Operations.40. Anti-submarine patrols have resulted in few sightings and attacks on.enemy shipping were on a very small scale.Hampdens, carrying torpedoes, and Hudsons attacked a convoy off the DutchIslands. Two ships of 2,500 and 3,500 tons were hit with bombs but no resultsof the torpedo attacks could be seen.A total of 65 aircraft laid 108 mines in enemy waters.From the week&apos;s operations, nine aircraft are missing and two crashed inthis country.Mediterranean.French North Africa.41. Allied aircraft based on Malta, Libya and North Africa continued theirsuccessful and sustained attacks on targets in enemy-occupied Tunisia, in spiteof adverse flying conditions. Many tons of bombs were dropped on the docks and harbours at Tunis, La Goulette and Bizerta. Extensive fires were started at fueldepots and in railway yards at these ports, while hits were also seen on barracks,phosphate quays and snipping; the vessels damaged include a cruiser at Bizerta.Smaller-scale raids were made on Mateur and St. Cyprien, on airfields at la Sebaia, Sidi Tabet and Gabes, and on the ports and railway centres at Sfax,Monastir and Sousse.Defensive patrols were maintained over Blida, Algiers Bay, Bone harbour and Allied airfields. Protective *cover was provided for our forward troops and fighters carried out offensive operations against enemy positions. Transport wasrepeatedly attacked a tank and about 13 M.T. vehicles were destroyed on the
road between Kairouan and Fondouk el Aouarab (50 miles W.S.W. of Sousse).Later, in the same area, about 60 trucks are believed to have been destroyed;elsewhere lorries and communications were machine-gunned with good effect.Enemy activity was dispersed and, in general, was somewhat restricted. Anumber of light-scale raids were attempted against Bone and attacks are reported on Allied positions at Youks les Bains and on airfields at Canrobert, Souk el Arbaand Tebessa.During the period reviewed, enemy casualties were 33 destroyed, of whichnight-fighters accounted for eight, and 17 probably destroyed or damaged. Welost 19 aircraft (two pilots safe).Libya and Tripolitania.42. The week opened with daylight activity directed mainly against M.T. inthe Nofilia area. As the enemy&apos;s retirement proceeded, our fighter-bombers,operating from very advanced landing-grounds, harassed his transport as far westas Buerat el Hsun. Numerous transport vehicles were destroyed or damaged,casualties were inflicted on enemy troops and several A.A. guns were silenced. a surprise attack by fighters on the landing-ground at Hun (130 miles S.S.W. ofSirte) resulted in the destruction of seven enemy aircraft and damage to others.By night, our medium bombers attacked similar targets as well as buildings at Buerat el Hsun. Sea-mines were laid in the approaches to Misurata, Horns (L),and Tripoli.Activity was somewhat hampered by weather during the latter part of theweek, but the total sorties did not decline appreciably below those flown lastweek.In daylight, enemy reaction was slight, many of our offensive patrols being completed without sighting any hostile aircraft. Small enemy raids were carriedout on Marble Arch, Benina and against shipping at Tolmeta. Raids on Jedabyawest landing-ground caused only slight damage and dive-bombing attacks onEl Aderh and Berca satellite were equally ineffective. At night, attacks weremade on shipping off Benghazi, where a corvette was sunk, and at Tobruk, where two fires were started.Enemy casualties totalled 13 aircraft, of which five were destroyed by nightfighters. Thirteen of our Libya-based aircraft are missing, some of which were lost in operations against objectives in Tunisia.Sicily and the Sicilian Channel.43. Aircraft in transit between Italian airfields and Tunisia were inter-cepted by our fighters based on Malta. Fourteen southbound enemy aircraft were shot down, including a S.M.82 (50-seater Italian transport); four other S.M.82s,flying north, were also destroyed or severely damaged. These interceptionsentailed the loss of four of our aircraft. ...The landing-ground on Lampedusa Island was raided and at least four aircraft were destroyed on the ground. A number of seaplanes were damagedat Marsala. &quot;Intruders&quot; dropped bombs on the airfields at Trapani, Comiso,Gela and Castelvetrano.Naval Albacores from Malta torpedoed a 4,000-ton ship, westbound, 28 miles .N.E. of Marittimo Island, and sank one of her escort vessels. Fighters, also from Malta, attacked an escorted westbound ship of 1,000 tons, 10 miles east ofSousse; bombs struck the ship amidships, causing numerous explosions. hits were also made by a Beaufighter on an enemy ship off the west coast of Sicily.Malta.44. A number of threatened attacks on the Island did not materialise, theraiders avoiding combat when intercepted by our fighters. On one night, however,when 40 enemy aircraft approached the Island, some succeeded in crossing thecoast, the remainder jettisoning their bombs; seven Wellingtons were destroyedat Luqa, but attacks on other airfields at Takali, Hal Far and Krendi causedno serious damage. Our fighters, one of which is missing, destroyed five of theenemy and damaged others; (these are in addition to the casualties reported inparagraph 43).Crete. -    i --k^.      , ;   .  , ,   &apos;    &quot;.   ,        &apos; ;  \   ,45. Wellingtons bombed Tymbaki airfield and started nine fires in the dispersal areas. -
Russia.46. On the Northern Front, Russian aircraft raided Petsamo and bombedHelsinki and the Kotka area.On the Central Front, ground attack aircraft with fighter protectionoperated against the main battle line, and there was very lively Russian air activity by all types of aircraft in the Veliki-Luki region. The town of Nevel, onthe railway S.W. of Veliki-Luki was continuously raided at night.On the Southern Front, it is believed that the Russian air force is givingeffective support to their troops in the Central Don sector, so far as weatherpermits. In the Stalingrad area, it seems clear that the Russians are stillconcentrating against transport aircraft, forward airfields and lines of com-munication. In the Central Caucasus, two raids are reported on Germanairfields S.E. of Nalchik; 31 aircraft are claimed to have been destroyed onthe ground.The Russian air force claim that, during the week ended 19th December,322 German aircraft were destroyed, of which 94 were transport aircraft. their losses are given as 156 aircraft.India and Burma.47. Several attacks were made on targets in the Akyab area. AtRathedaung, the town and water-front were successfully bombed and, at Akyabitself, a steamer and machine-gun posts were damaged. The villages of Chaungneand Yechanbuin were bombed and machine-gunned.In north Burma, U.S. Kittyhawks bombed a suspected enemy headquarters at Maingkwan and targets at Kamaing, Shingbwiyang and Washawng.In south Burma, the airfield at Magwe was attacked by sixteen escortedBlenheims and a night attack by Liberators and Wellingtons was made onToungoo airfield.On the Burma-China frontier, Lashio was attacked by U.S. Mitchells which reported hits on the airfield runways and several fires in the town.A total of 15 enemy aircraft made three night attacks on the Calcutta areabut no serious damage resulted.China.48, U.S. Mitchells and Kittyhawks attacked Wanling, Lungling and the airfield at Gialam (Hanoi), where a petrol dump and repair shop were hit.Netherlands East Indies.49.   Catalinas bombed Sabang Harbour (Sumatra) and Kuta Raja (25 miles. of Sabang).  At Sabang bursts were seen on wharves and buildings.In Timor, U.S. Bostons attacked Dilli and Maobisse.New Guinea Area.50. Allied aircraft attacked enemy positions at Buna, Sanananda and inthe Mangrove Islands group. In addition, many barges in the Mambare river and huts on the Amboga river were destroyed. U.S. bombers made three attacks on a southbound convoy north of Madang; :a light cruiser was hit and later seen in a sinking condition. A reconnaissance aircraft made two hits on a ship,possibly a destroyer, north of Buna and attacks on the harbours at Finschafenand Arawe (New Britain) by U.S.. Fortresses resulted in severe damage to threesmall ships.  At Madang, buildings in the wharf area were bombed and hit.In the above operations four enemy fighters were destroyed in combat for theloss of one Allied bomber.Enemy offensive activity was confined to two small ineffective attacks onthe Port Moresby area and one on Dobodura (12 miles S.W. of Buna).Solomon Islands.51. U.S. aircraft attacked enemy installations and the newly constructedairfield at Munda on New Georgia Island. Up to the 20th, raids on nine successivedays had been made on this target.
Aleutians.52. U.S. Liberators bombed shore installations on Kiska Island, causingheavy explosions and fires.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.53. Although there has been no heavy attack during the week, there hasbeen an increase in the number of enemy bombing and machine gun incidents;these took place on five days and two nights.During daylight raiding was mainly confined to the coastal areas of theSouth and a few incidents occurred on the Devon and East Anglian coasts. Onthe 18th damage was done to the shopping centre at Eastbourne when 18 persons were killed and 22 seriously injured. At Great Yarmouth on the 22nd extensive damage was done to house property and production at a parachute silk factorywas slightly affected. Utility services in a number of places were affected and seven attacks were made on railways.The two night raids were chiefly confined to the north-east coastal andinland areas. At York, on the 17th/18th the gas works were damaged and atHull on the 20th/21st, some damage was done to an overhead railway embank-ment in the central part of the city.Casualties.54. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours on the23rd December was 48 killed and 119 seriously injured.APPENDICES I, II and III, will be published monthly.APPENDIX IY.Enemy Merchant Ship Losses as assessed to November 30, 1952.Nationality.
