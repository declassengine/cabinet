December 1942. * * * &quot;SECRET. / Copy, No.W.P. (42) 574. /December 11, 1942.WAR CABINET.THE MINISTER RESIDENT IN WASHINGTON FOR SUPPLY.Note by the Minister of Production.THE appointment of the Minister Resident in Washington for Supply was announced on the 23rd November. I am anxious that he should proceed to take up his new duties as early as possible in order that he may follow up outstandingmatters in connection with my recently completed mission.2. I have discussed and agreed with Colonel Llewellin what his duties should be, and I attach the Terms of Reference proposed as Annex 1 to this note. These follow the existing terms of reference for the British Supply Councilshown at Annex 2.3. Broadly speaking, the Resident Minister will act as my deputy in washington. He will be responsible for co-ordinating the work of the BritishCivilian Missions and of the British civilian members of the Combined Boards,within the terms of reference previously approved for the British Supply Council,of which he will become the Chairman.Mr. R. H. Brand has during recent months been acting as Chairmanof the Supply Council as well as fulfilling his duties as head of the British food mission, but experience has shown that the burden of these double duties is too heavy.4. It is important that the Resident Minister should not be burdened withdetailed work in connection with any one of the Missions or Combined Boards.I do not therefore propose, and Colonel Llewellin does not wish, that thereshould be any alteration in the present arrangement whereby Sir Robert Sinclairrepresents me on the Combined Production and Resources Board, of which I am the British member.5. No reference is made in the Terms of Reference (attached as Annex 1) tothe Combined Munitions Assignment Board, nor to the possibility of the resident minister co-ordinating the work of the British representatives on this body. Itmay be suggested that since Mr. Hopkins is Chairman of the Board, the principalBritish representative should also be a civilian. I consider, however, that it isdesirable that no recommendation should be made on this point untilColonel Llewellin has had an opportunity of examining the problem on the spotwith Field-Marshal Dill.6. It has been recommended to me by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs that an Assistant Secretary from the Dominions Office should be attachedto the staff of Colonel Llewellin. The purpose of this appointment would be tokeep the various Dominions Missions in Washington in proper relation to themachinery of the British Missions and Combined Boards, and ensure that their interests are at all times fully considered. I am of opinion that this suggestionshould be adopted, especially following on the recent creation of the Common-wealth Supply Council in London, and the consequent importance of keeping the Dominions representatives in Washington fully informed of the London view.[24745] -
7. Under the general arrangements for the Resident Minister which I haveenvisaged, it will not be necessary for a large staff to accompany him to washington. He will make full use of the staff and machinery of the supply council, which may need some strengthening.8. I ask my colleagues to agree with the arrangements set out above and tothe Terms of Reference for the Resident Minister as proposed in Annex 1.O. L.Ministry of Production, S.W. 1,December 11, 1942.ANNEX 1.The Minister Resident in Washington for Supply.Terms of Reference..
