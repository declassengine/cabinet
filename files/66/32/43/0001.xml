THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 613.December 30, 1942.WAR CABINET.HOME FOOD PRODUCTION.Note by the Prime Minister.I have asked the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Home Secretary to epitomise the results of theirlabours on the land. The achievement in increasing our home-grown food andthus saving over 10 million tons of imports must be regarded as a very direct and vital contribution to our survival and ultimate victory. I feel sure mycolleagues would wish a formal expression of the approval of the War Cabinetto be conveyed to the Ministers concerned, and that they should in turn make this known throughout their Departments and among their voluntary assistants.W. s. c.10, Downing Street, S.W.1.[24816a]

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTHOME FOOD PRODUCTION.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretaryof State  for Scotland  and the  Secretary  of  State for  the home department.I. The ploughing-up campaign las increased the United Kingdom arableacreage from just under 13 million acres in 1939 to 17  million acres in 1942,i.e., by more than one-third.2. The net output of food (measured by calories and protein) derived fromthe soil of this country in 1942-43 will be about 70 per cent, above pre-war. Interms of calories the increase is approximately 68 per cent, and in terms ofproteins 82 per cent.3. We are now producing in this country two-thirds by weight of thefood to be consumed this year.4. All this has been done despite a net decrease of about 500,000 acres inthe total cultivated area, owing in the main to the demand for agricultural landfor aerodromes and other war purposes.5. The estimated shipping requirements in 1942-43 for food and feedingstuffs measured in tons have been reduced by more than half from an averageof 21-3 million tons pre-war to&apos;10-1 million tons in 1942-43.6. Feeding stuffs imported as such have been reduced from aboutj5^ million tons to practically nothing. Feeding stuffs derived from imported wheat and oilseeds have been reduced by more than one-half.7.   The exceptional harvest of 1942 has contributed substantially.8. We have increased our production of wheat by about 53 per cent., froma pre-war average of 1 - 56 million tons to 2 - 54 million tons in 1942; potatoesby nearly 90 per cent., from 5-35 million tons to 10-1 million tons; sugar beetfrom 2f million tons to about 4 million tons, which is as much as the sugar beet factories can handle and covers the domestic sugar ration, vegetables (farms,gardens and allotments) from 4 million to 6^ million tons.9. These results have been achieved without any appreciable increase inthe effective labour force, indeed despite a substantial loss of skilled men anddilution with women. The standard of farming efficiency has been greatlyraised.  V/e now have the most highly mechanised &quot;agriculture in the world.10. This has only been possible through the willing co-operation of some500,000 individual producers and their workers, and the devoted work of 7,000unpaid members of Executive and District Committees, who represent the bestfarming knowledge and experience in their areas. The County Committeeorganisation has proved an interesting and highly successful experiment indecentralisation.II. For the 1943 harvest, although tillage percentage throughout the UnitedKingdom is already approaching the maximum possible, the aim is to securethe ploughing up of an additional million acres in England and Wales and anincrease in the acreage under wheat (from 2 - 4 million acres this year to 3 million acres next year), barley (for the loaf), potatoes and vegetables; in Scotland anadditional 50-60 thousand acres, mainly devoted to wheat and potatoes, is planned.12. We have asked for an overall increase of 10 to 15 per cent, in production.Whether we shall succeed depends on (i) weather,(ii) adequate supply of fertilisers,(iii) adequate supply of man-power.Both (ii) and (iii) are, we fear, likely to fall short of requirements. -(Initialled) R. S. H.&apos;   T. J.December 24, 1942. H. M.[24816]
