SECRET. Cony No,    9,,..........,..........................,,W.P. (42) 571. /December 8, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOOK AND KmIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.FRENCH NORTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will be interested to see the enclosed report by Mr. Mack.A. E.Foreign Office, December 8, 1942.ANNEX.GENERAL BETHOUARD, who commanded a French Division in Moroccoand who arrested General Nogues shortly after zero hour on D-day, is at present at Gibraltar with Colonel Magnon. General Giraud thought it well that heshould be out of the way for a little time until he had reorganised the french army and it had been in action against the Axis. General Giraud thereforewished General Bethouard to go to Gibraltar, where he is nominally performingthe duties of liaison officer in regard to material coming through.General Mast, who assisted Mr. Murphy at Algiers, is at present working inGeneral Eisenhower&apos;s Headquarters at Algiers as a liaison officer in civilianclothes.General Giraud has told these officers that they must have patience and trusthim, and that he will restore them to commands within a very short time.General Eisenhower has secured from Admiral Darlan a promise that he will shortly issue a statement burying the past so far as these officers are concerned,and General Eisenhower proposes to insist that Darlan also publishes a statementsaying exactly what commands these officers are being given.I had a long talk with General Bethouard at Gibraltar on the 5th December.His views in brief are as follows : General Giraud arrived in North Africa too late. (He arrived on D plus 1.)If he had arrived forty-eight, or even twenty-four, hours earlier he would havebeen able to take hold of the situation. Bethouard himself was ready in Moroccoand he had thought that American troops would be in Rabat on the early morning of D-day. General Bethouard gave me the impression that, owing to general giraud&apos;s &apos;s late arrival, he believed that General Clark had done the only thingpossible in accepting General Giraud&apos;s advice and coming to an arrangement withDarlan. He said that &apos;&apos; le mystique de Petain est epouvantable &apos;5; Darlan mustbe got rid of sometime, but there is nothing to be done now while the battle is inprogress.  As to the means, he was insistent that Darlan must be got rid of by11920   [24729]   &apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.

Frenchmen. He thought that the best thing would be an arrangement betweenDarlan and General de Gaulle. It was essential to get General de Gaulle intothe North African Commission. This would have a very great effect among all allied supporters in North Africa. Some army officers would resign, but theywere the kind of officers whom the army could well do without. There was already a nucleus in the High Commission itself of Allied supporters who hadbeen working with the Americans for the last year or more. He mentioned inparticular M. Dastier, the head of security, M. Saint Hardouin, the head ofForeign Affairs, and M. Bigaud, whose duties more or less correspond to those of minister of the Interior. Among those who had to be got rid of in addition toDarlan he mentioned Admiral Michelier, General Mendigal, head of the AirForce, and General Nogues, to whom he said General Catroux would be an excellent successor. As to how this could be arranged, he said that Darlan should send a message to de Gaulle, to which the latter would respond and there wouldbe negotiations. De Gaulle could make his conditions perfectly clear. The mainthing was to get him into the North African Commission. I asked GeneralBethouard if he himself would be prepared to be the bearer of such a message tode Gaulle. He said that he would gladly do it, if General Giraud so instructedhim. He was under General Giraud&apos;s orders. He knew General de Gaulle very well. They were camarades de promotion and tutoyaient one another. If I sawGeneral de Gaulle in London, he hoped that I would present his amities to him.In regard to the above, General Clark told me about ten days ago thatDarlan had spoken to him of sending a message to de Gaulle. General Clarkhad advised against doing anything of the kind at present, as there were quiteenough complications in the situation. This is also General Eisenhower&apos;s view.He does not want any additional complication brought in while the issue of the battle for Tunisia is in doubt.On the general situation General Eisenhower&apos;s view is as follows : He knows that if we have a, few reverses Darlan and Company are quite ready to switch over to the Axis. At the same time he is devoting all his energiesto the winning of the Battle of Tunisia. To win this, he is completely dependenton the French, which. means in effect on Darlan, to whom Giraud referseverything. So far Darlan has delivered the goods, and General Eisenhowersays that there is no request which he has made to Darlan which Darlan has not met. General Eisenhower&apos;s internal military position in North Africa is such that he has to play with Darlan. If Darlan ordered two or three bridges onthe line of communications to Tunisia to be sabotaged, the whole of our forces would have to be withdrawn. If Darlan ordered no co-operation in the port ofAlgiers, the supply position would be very much worse than it is now. Morocco,too, must be kept quiet. But American troops there are in insufficient numbers to run the country themselves if there was trouble among the tribes. All theavailable American armour there is being sent forward to Tunisia. In thesecircumstances General Eisenhower considers that he has no alternative but toplay with Darlan and ensure that he delivers the goods. For him these military considerations are paramount.W. H.
