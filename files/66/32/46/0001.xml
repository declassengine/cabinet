naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   A convoy has arrived safely in N. Russian ports.   An outward bound convoy has been heavily attacked in Mid-Atlantic by U-boats.Three U-boats have been sunk.Shipping losses are higher than last week.Northern Waters.2. A convoy, consisting of 16 ships, from the United Kingdom arrived in north Russian ports on the 25th without loss. H.M. ships provided cover andescort.Mediterranean.3. The following attacks have been reported by H.M. Submarines : Rorqual probably sank a laden northbound ship Of 2,500 tons off Naples onthe 18th. P. 211, in the Gulf of Hamniamet, Tunisia, between the 18th and 22nd,sank a schooner of 150 tons laden with petrol, shelled and drove ashore a tankerof 400 tons and sank an Italian schooner of 290 tons, taking 12 of the crewprisoner. Ursula, off N.W. Sicily, sank a 6,000-ton transport on the 28th. two days later, while diving to attack an escorted convoy, Ursula was rammed by a merchant ship and sustained some damage.Naval Albacores from Malta bombed barges at Sousse on the night of the26th/27th, on the 29th torpedoed and sank a 4,000-ton ship off Panteilaria, andprobably sank a 3,000-ton ship west of Sicily on the 30th.South-West Pacific.4. On the 21st several warships and 44 transports were sighted at Rabauland on the 28th a J apanese heavy cruiser or large transport was set on fire by allied aircraft.Black Sea.5. Russian surface forces attacked two ships escorted by a destroyer andminesweepers in the Sulina area on the 13th. One ship and a minesweeper were set on fire.On the 16th Russian light craft raided Anapa Harbour and sank threeammunition barges.On the 20th Russian warships bombarded Yalta and Feodosia.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. Eight attacks by aircraft and six by surface craft have been made onU-boats during the week, in addition to the attacks made by the escorts of the outward-bound convoy in Mid-Atlantic.H.M. Destroyers Hesperus and Vanessa sank a U-boat west of the Hebrideswhile escorting a homeward-bound convoy on the 26th, and picked up eightsurvivors.Two promising attacks were made by aircraft, one by a Wellington in the bay of Biscay and the other by a Liberator escorting an outward-bound convoy.H.M. Submarine P. 219 attacked a U-boat off Bone on the 23rdThe U.S. Willi am F. Cody (7,176 tons) probably destroyed a U-boat on the24th when south-west of Colombo.A number of attacks were made by H.M. Canadian Destroyer St. Laurent, and h.M. Canadian Corvettes Shediac and Chilliwack, when escorting an outward-bound convoy.In the S.W. Pacific M.T.B&apos;s. sank a Japanese U-boat off New Guinea onthe 25th, and the U.S. Submarine Snapdragon sank another in the St. GeorgesChannel (Bismarck Archipelago).Enemy Intelligence.German.7. Russian air reconnaissance on the 27th showed two cruisers, one pocket-battleship or cruiser and three destroyers in Altenfiord and two destroyers inHammerfest. The larger ships were probably Hipper, Koki and either Lutzowor nurnberg. Lutzow is believed to have proceeded to Norwegian waters during december. Reconnaissance of Kiel and Bremen showed a ship which is probablyGraf Zep-pelin in the floating dock at Kiel on the 23rd, and the Seidlitz lying atBremen with most of her guns removed.
Italian.8. Air reconnaissance of Trieste on the 23rd showed that the new battleshipImpero had been moved to that port from Venice. The examination of the photographs taken at Genoa on the 11th and 21st showed that the hull of theRegolo class cruiser, which was being built there, was in process of being converted to an aircraft-carrier. It is considered that the conversion of the liners Romaand Augustus to aircraft-carriers cannot be completed before April or May 1943in the case of the former, and the late summer in the case of the latter.Enemy traffic across the Mediterranean continues to be concentrated on Tunis,Bizerta and Sousse, and little, if anything, has arrived at Tripoli.Japanese.9. In the Pacific the Japanese state of heavy cruisers is believed to be sixeffective, six sunk and six damaged, and, of aircraft-carriers, two effective (63 and36 aircraft), five sunk and one damaged.U-boats.10. U-boat activity persists on the N. Atlantic convoy routes. It isestimated that 90 are operating in the Atlantic.U-boats were also active off the N.E. coast of Brazil.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending 28th/29th, 903 -ships have been convoyed. Ofthese 163 were in ocean convoys and 740 in British coastal convoys.One auxiliary aircraft-carrier, 66 destroyers (including eight U.S. destroyers)and 70 cutters and corvettes (including three U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties. ,Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending 26th totalled 801,000 tons, compared with 321,000 tons duringthe previous seven days, and an average of 474,400 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 381,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.12. In repeated attacks by a concentration of U-boats on an outward-bound convoy, lasting over several days in mid-Atlantic, and while beyond the range of air protection, 15 ships were torpedoed and of these 12 (totalling63,937 tons) are believed to have sunk.An attack by U-boats on a homeward-bound convoy in the NW. Approacheswas successfully driven off by escorts and aircraft. &quot;A Spanish tanker was torpedoed off Vigo but was able to reach port.A ship was slightly damaged at Murmansk by air attack, and a Dutch ship was damaged off the southern coast of New Guinea by Japanese aircraft.British Minelaying.13. Aircraft have laid mines in the North Sea, Bay of Biscay and in theMediterranean.Enemy Minelaying and British Mines weeping.14.. There have been no reports of enemy minelaying either by surface craftor aircraft during the week in Home Waters. Sixty-six mines have been destroyedoff the North Foreland, making a total of 160 destroyed in this area.A sailing barge was blown up in the Thames Estuary.Enemy aircraft laid mines in Algiers Bay on the night of the 25th/26th.Two acoustic mines were destroyed in the Clyde ofT Helensburgh. The lastknown enemy minelaying in this area was by aircraft on the 5th May, 1941.The mine totals are:  magnetic 2,748; acoustic 1,326; moored 2,013.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Blockade-Running between the Bay of Biscay and Japan.15. The principal developments in this vitally important traffic during november were (a) The arrival at Bordeaux of three blockade-runners from the Far East (thefirst arrivals since early May), and the beginning of a new and more intensive phase of activity from East to West.[24837] . . B
(&amp;) The departure, from ports in the Bay of Biscay of five Far Easternblockade-runners (four merchant ships and one tanker) is the highestscale of activity yet recorded.(c) The apparent intensification of the effort to.prepare tankers for the voyage to the Far East.. Tankers would provide the speediest and most economical form of transport for the edible oils which Germany sourgently needs to maintain her fats ration.(d) The severe, though probably indecisive, blockade by the Allies; the sinking of three blockade-runners, and the damaging of one orprobably two more.During, the early part of &quot;November the Tannenfels (7,840 tons), Dresden(5,567 tons) and Kulmerland (7,363 tons) arrived at Bordeaux carrying, it isreported, rubber and vegetable oils. Their total carrying capacity is estimated to be 16,000 tons, and it is likely that approximately half this capacity was taken up with rubber.Although this scale of activity of three arrivals a month is unlikely to be exceeded during the next two or three months, it may well be augmented in the spring.Five blockade-runners attempted to clear the Bay for the Far East during november, one of which may have reached Japan. Two were sunk by Alliedwarships and two were forced to return to port after being attacked by our aircraft.On the 22nd it was estimated that four tankers and ten other blockade-runnerswere in Biscay ports. Fifteen blockade-runners are now in the Far East or onhomeward passage.Eight Allied ships and four tankers, which are missing and may have been captured by the enemy, are suitable for blockade running.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Central Sector.16. The Russian offensive west of Moscow has been appreciably reduced,partly because of unfavourable weather reports speak of wet snow partly, nodoubt, because the Russians have achieved their object of preventing the despatchof German reinforcements to the Southern front. The Russians are now directingtheir main effort to consolidating the ground gained.Middle Don Sector.17.   The Russians have made rapid and extensive progress in two directions.First, continuing their, thrust southward from Boguchar, they have passeddown the western side of the railway Svoboda-Rostov; have reached to withinten miles of Millerovo on the railway itself; and, sweeping in from the east, have cut the railway a second time some distance south of Millerovo. Millerovo, there-fore, is in danger of encirclement.Secondly, advancing south-westward on a wide front from the River Chir,the Russians reached Tatsinskaya, some 25 miles from the River Donets, thuscutting the main railway from the Ukraine to the Don bend. An extension of thisthrust would threaten the important junction of Likhaya, some 70 miles north ofRostov.Stalingrad Sector.18. East of the Don the Russians continue their attempts to annihilate theencircled Germans, who are reported to be short of food and ammunition, though some transport aircraft are getting through.In their efforts to relieve this force from south-west of Stalingrad the germans have made some progress northward of the River Aksai. They have, however, been driven back and, in a sweeping counter-offensive, the Russians have taken Kotel-nikov and a considerable area to the south-south-east of that town. Kotelnikovhas no strategic importance, but it appears to have been a supply base of somesignificance.
Caucasus Sector.19. After some weeks of continued pressure against the German forces west of Ordjonikidze, the Russians have retaken Alagir and are pressing north-westwards in the direction of Nalchik. .   .Summary.20. In the last ten days the Russians have advanced some 50 to 75 milestowards the two main nodal points of the Don bend Millerovo and Likhaya.The Russians themselves describe the enemy withdrawal as disorderly, and thechief limiting factor to the Russian advance appears to be their, supply position.Largely for that reason no doubt there has latterly been a pause in Russianprogress.It is too early as yet to speak of any thrust to Rostov, but if the Russianscan retain their hold on the railway running from the Don bend to Likhaya,German ability to stage a counter-thrust will be much reduced and the german forces in Caucasia may well feel their position endangered.South-west of Stalingrad the Russian offensive is again in full swing.Pre-occupied as they are with their flank north of Rostov, it seems unlikely thatthe Germans can spare any reserves for a renewal of their effort in the Kotelnikovarea. The German force encircled east of the Don may, therefore, have to be leftto its fate.Tunisia.21. During the past week bad weather has again confined activity chieflyto patrolling. Even this is limited, by rain and mud which make deployment of vehicles off the roads a hazardous undertaking.On the night of the 22nd/23rd, however, our forces made a local attack on the hill feature of Djebel Ahmera, some six miles to the north of Medjez el Bab.At the same time an attack was staged in the area of Grich el Oued. Both these attacks were initially successful. At Djebel Ahmera, however, the enemy counter-attacked and the struggle that continued throughout the 24th left us in the evening in possession of the hill except for the crest. A further attack the samenight by our forces gave us the hill feature except for the highest ridges. We heldthese gains until dawn of Christmas Day, when the Germans counter-attackedonce more and recovered their previous hold on the crest. We attacked yet again and succeeded in restoring the position, but the following night withdrew in face of heavy enemy bombardment.22. To the south the French had been actively engaged with the enemy inthe neighbourhood of Pichon, where they claimed, to have repulsed several enemy attacks and to have captured prisoners and war material. At Diebel Fkirine a successful attack by the French resulted in the capture of about 100 Italians.On the 28th, however, they were counter-attacked in this area by a mixed Germanand Italian force supported by German tanks.  Fierce fighting continues.The steady reinforcement of First Army proceeds. Every effort is being madeto improve our lines of communication, which have not been helped by the deplorable-able weather and. the consequently poof&quot; state of the roads..Libya.23. The enemy&apos;s movement westward has continued. Our patrols have maintained intermittent contact with the rearguard.Sirte was occupied on the 25th, and by the 27th our forward troops were inTamet, 25 miles west of Sirte. On the following day, patrols of armoured carspushed forward to the line of Wadi Bei El Kebir, 40 miles west of Sirte and inthe area immediately north-east of Bu Ngem. On the 29th the enemy withdrewhis rearguard from the Wadi. Bei El Kebir towards his main position atGheddadia. Bouerat area is reported clear of the enemy and our advanced patrolsoperating north and west from Bir El Zidan are now across the Bu Ngem-Gheddadia road at a point approximately 25 miles south of Gheddadia.24.   The railway has been wrorking to satisfactory capacity as -far as Tobruk.The tonnage handled through Benghazi has again increased; but good,results are dependent on the present favourable weather continuing.The salvage organisation has during the period of the 23rd October-22nd December, collected and re-issued or evacuated 500,000 Jerricans, 70,000[24837] . B 2   &apos;
44-gaiion drums, 11,500 tyres and-565 tons of blankets, clothing and equipment.A large quantity of recaptured British ammunition has also been serviced ready for issue.French Somaliland.25. During November, a steady stream of deserters from Djibouti came overto our forces in British Somaliland and Ethiopia.On the 28th November, a force about 1,800 strong marched.into british somali land and joined the Allies. This move was made by permission of theGovernor of French Somaliland.Negotiations were initiated between the British and the French national committee on the one hand and the Djibouti authorities on the other in the hopeof rallying the colony to Fighting France.These negotiations having proved abortive, a Free French Force, made up ofthose troops which had marched out of the Colony, crossed the frontier at0600 hours on the 26th December.The Garrison of Ali Sabiet (40 miles S.W. of Djibouti) rallied to themand the force moved on bv train to seize the important railwav bridges atHoi Hoi (22 miles S.W. of &quot;Djibouti) and Chebele (15 miles S.W. of Djibouti).This task was successfully carried out and no opposition was encountered.At 2015 hours on the 28th December, the Governor signed an agreement bywhich the Colony adhered to the United Nations as part, of Fighting France.Prior to this, the majority of the troops remaining in the Colony had ralliedwithout resisting.Burma.A kyab.26. &apos; The Japanese are reported to be concentrating on the defence of AkyabIsland-and building beach defences. Our troops have reached points 35 miles north of Akyab without encountering opposition.Chin Hills.27. There has been increased patrol activity on the part of the Japanese inthis area.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.28. Confused fighting continues in the Buna area where U.S. troops have occupied the main Buna airfield and are pushing the enemy north-westwards.The Japanese are consolidating their hold on Dutch New Guinea. Fourhundred and fifty Japanese have landed at Kaukenau, on the south-west coast.Timor.29. The Japanese have further reinforced their garrison on the island whichis now estimated to number 13,000.Borneo.30. Japanese strength is now thought to amount to a detachment of garrisontroops only, and not to a full division as previously estimated.AIR SITUATION.General Review.31.   U.S. Fortresses made a daylight attack on submarine pens at Lorient.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean andin the South-West Pacific.&apos; United Kingdom.32.   Enemy activity against this country was on a very small scale.   Onlynine enemy aircraft crossed our coast by day.  There was no night activity.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Pay-33. An operation on a large scale was carried out by TJ.S. Fortresses on thesubmarine pens at Keroman (Lorient). Seventy-seven aircraft were despatched,40 of which bombed the target in good weather conditions from over 20,000 feetand dropped 7.8.x 2,000-lb. bombs. Preliminary reports state that there were many hits on the pens. Three Fortresses are missing from the attack, and as aresult of encounters with enemy aircraft provisional claims are made of28 destroyed, nine probably destroyed and four damaged.Ten squadrons of fighters provided cover for the bombers as far as the coast of Brittany and other formations swept the Cherbourg area, but there were noencounters with enemy aircraft.Harassing attacks on targets in the Low Countries and Northern france were restricted by very unfavourable weather conditions. The railway centresat Amiens, Tergnier and Laon were bombed and hit from a low level by fiveMosquitos. Three goods trains and one ammunition train were &quot;effectivelyattacked by fighters.Night.: 34. Weather conditions throughout the week were unfavourable for large-scale bombing operations. Attacks by Mosquitos were made on Meiderich (S. ofDuisburg) and Essen.Coastal Operations.35.   Routine patrols were carried out against U-boats and enemy shipping.A convoy of three escorted ships was attacked by two Hampdens off Statiand,and one vessel of 5,000 tons was set on fire. Other attacks were made in the bay of Biscay and off Kristiansand South, but results were unobserved.Results of&apos; anti-U-boat activity are summarised&apos; under &quot; Naval Situation.&quot;&quot;A total of 25 aircraft laid 70 mines in enemy waters. Two naval Swordfish -are missing&apos;.Mediterranean.French North Africa.36. In spite of very bad weather, Allied aircraft based on French north africa, Libya and Malta continued their attacks on the enemy in Tunisia.The principal targets were the harbours at Tunis, La Goulette and Sousse,all of which were heavily bombed day and night. Attacks on a smaller scale weremade on Bizerta and Sfax harbours. Several ships were hit. Three of these were set on fire, one was seen to explode, and it is believed that others were sunk. large fires were started on the quays and among dockside buildings and petrol storageinstallations. Railway stations, depots and marshalling yards were hit and severely damaged.Among other enemy targets attacked were M.T., troops, gun positions,railway tracks, bridges and locomotive engines.Defensive patrols were maintained over the harbours at Or an, Algiers andBone, escorts were provided for shipping, and reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols were flown.Small forces of enemy long-range bombers laid mines off Algiers. &apos; Fighter-bombers bombed our forward airfields and fighters attacked ground positions onour southern flank.Libya.37.   The weather in Libya again restricted our operations.Our fighters maintained reconnaissance and offensive patrols over the battle area and provided protection for shipping off the Libyan coast. During an offensive sweep over our forward troops Kittyhawks using a new landing ground40 miles west of Nofilia intercepted two formations of escorted dive-bombers and fighter-bombers respectively. Eight Me. 109s were shot down and two others were damaged without loss to ourselves.
