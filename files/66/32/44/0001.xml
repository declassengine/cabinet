THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 614.December 30, 1942.WAR CABINET.COLONIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.IN his memorandum W.P. (42) 606, the Minister of Labour expresses hisconcern at the suggestion of the Secretary of State for India, in W.P. (42) 575,that India should not be directly represented on any Regional Commission thatmay be set up for the Far East or Soutlh-Eastern Asia as part of the proposals made in W.P. (42) 544.I agree with him that to omit India on grounds that gave colour to asuspicion that she had not, in our opinion, the requisite status for membership would be unfortunate from every point of view. It would exacerbate feeling in India, and it would strengthen the hands of those people, both in the UnitedStates and China, who harbour suspicions as to the sincerity of our Indian policy.On the other hand, I see valid reasons of a different and more practicalcharacter against the membership of India in the proposed Regional Commission.The scheme which has been approved by the Cabinet does not, as I understand it,envisage a Commission for the whole of the &quot; Far East and South-Eastern Asia.&quot;It is intended to concern itself with the international aspects of only a compara-tively limited Colonial area, stretching from Malaya on the West, includingBorneo and the Dutch East Indies, and extending, on the East, to the Philippinesand the islands of the Western Pacific. This is the area which has in the pastpresented one of the most insoluble problems from the Defence point of view.Other parts of the world were covered, to some extent at any rate, by the Leagueof Nations. The Western Pacific and the China Sea, owing to the absence ofthe United States from the League, were not. That is a gap which must this time be filled. The Defence organisation of the United Nations must be powerful and comprehensive enough to prevent further aggression in the Pacific by Japanor any other evilly-minded nation. For this purpose there must be close collabora-tion between the nations immediately concerned. These, I would suggest, areGreat Britain, the United States, China, Holland, and the Dominions ofAustralia and New Zealand. Into this set-up India does not naturally come.She can be strategically in no danger except in the event of a successfulaggression in the Western Pacific or the China Sea, and any such danger, it isto be hoped, the proposed international organisation will avert.She has perhaps more claim to membership on economic grounds, in view ofthe considerable Indian population in Malaya. But it is not a direct claim. TheBritish Government, which will be responsible for the administration of the malayan Peninsula, can be trusted to look after this element, and it is better thatwe should do so. For if we once admit the right of the Government of Indiato intervene in the internal administration of Malaya, on the grounds that thereis an Indian section of the population, we shall have to concede the same rightto the Chinese Government, in view of the very large Chinese population. Thiswould rapidly bring about a situation which would embody the worst features ofa condominium.Copy No.[24822]
We shall, I feel, fall into great error if we admit too many nations, withindirect interests, to these Commissions. After all, they are in essence ColonialCommissions, instituted primarily to promote collaboration between colonial powers in Colonial Areas. India is not a Colonial Power. She has no knowledgeor experience of Colonial administration. Nor has she so direct a defence or economic interest in the South-West Pacific as the other nations I have mentioned.If we open the door to her, we shall have to open it to many other nations, bothin the Pacific and in those other Colonial areas where Regional Commissionsare to be set up. I hope, therefore, that any Indian claim to membership willnot be conceded.C.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S. W. 1,December 30, 1942.
