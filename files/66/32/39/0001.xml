(42) 432 of the26th September last. Like that paper the present report represents the agreedviews of the various Departments concerned with this matter, including theService Departments.A. E.. Foreign Office, December 24, 1942.ANNEX.Morale in Germany.IN the first paper on Morale in Germany circulated in September 1942,* theconclusion was reached that, although German morale had only partially recovered from the shock it received in the winter of 1941-42, there were no signs that theGerman war effort has been appreciably affected or that any effective organisedopposition to the Nazi regime was developing. It was suggested that seriousreactions might be expected if the campaign in the East failed to destroy theRussian armies or to bring nearer a compromise peace, as understood in Germany,i.e., peace on conditions indistinguishable from our point of view from a majorGerman victory.2. The effects of the latest Russian offensives on the Eastern Front and ofthe Allied operations in North Africa are not yet fully apparent. They have certainly caused considerable disillusionment among the German people, particu-larly as regards their hopes of a compromise peace in the near future and of the capture of Stalingrad. On the other hand, the coming into effect in October ofthe increased food rations and the almost complete cessation of air attacks on germany during the last two months have mitigated the impact of adversemilitary developments. Consequently, the general trend of morale, which isdominated by the two factors of nervous strain and war-weariness, remains atpresent fundamentally unaffected.3. During the past two months the nervous strain on the population has notbeen relaxed. It has rather been accentuated by daily worries, especially about,housing, clothing and overwork; by anxiety about the soldiers abroad, especiallyin Russia, and the news of heavy casualties; by apprehension concerning thepresence in Germany of large numbers of foreign workers; and by the inability to visualise a radical improvement in conditions within the foreseeable future.In these conditions the German Government have been obliged to rely increasinglyon repression to.maintain the tempo of the war effort both in industry and inagriculture. The reign of fear is such that it will almost certainly be effective in preventing - the development of organised opposition, and. even in maintainingefficiency up to the point where nervous strain, becomes so great that it defeats* W.P.

2even fear. Damage to the war effort is, in fact,, likely to result not from organisedopposition among the masses, but from unco-ordinated, widespread andinvoluntary inefficiency resulting from overstrain.4. War-weariness and general apathy are now established traits of Germanmorale. They prevented the German people from responding with enthusiasm tothe most spectacular victories, and to-day they are reflected in the equal lack of popular interest in the possibility of political changes within Germany. Althoughdissatisfaction with the progress of the war has become more widespread andmore openly expressed, the great majority of the German people cannot visualisea workable alternative to the Nazi regime in Germany or to the New Order inEurope.5. The part played by propaganda to-day in the life of the average Germanis complex. Propaganda as such is largely discredited and the average Germantends to strike a balance between what his own Propaganda Ministry tells him and what he learns from Foreign sources, especially the B.B.C. None the less,German propaganda has so far been successful in persuading the German people that, in the event of defeat, the German nation will be annihilated and that theymust therefore stand or fall with the Nazi regime. Despite dwindling hopes of final victory, as originally conceived, there persists a widespread belief that the fortress of Europe is impregnable, that Germany will still be able to hold much that she has gained, and that her enemies will become sufficiently exhausted toagree to a compromise peace. But it is so far one of the outstanding failures ofthe Propaganda Ministry that, despite every effort, they have not been able to undermine the deep-seated belief of the German people that Germany, and theindividual German, have less to fear from the Anglo-Saxon Powers &quot;than fromSlav vengeance.6. The conclusion is that the German people is still preponderantly underthe influence of the terror of the Gestapo and of the relative success of the&apos;&apos; Strength through Fear &apos;&apos; campaign. Overstrain is likely to lead increasinglyto a slackening in the war effort, but such slackening would be unco-ordinatedand involuntary. It is impossible to predict when the breaking-point in moralewill be reached; it can only be said that the process is likely to be sudden ratherthan gradual. There is a certain amount of evidence of the existence of sporadicopposition amongst the working classes, especially in Austria and Silesia and in several North and West German cities. There is also discontent amongst the peasants as a result of the increasing official pressure on them and the recent lossof the privileged position which they hitherto enjoyed. But any organisedpopular opposition is virtually impossible in a National Socialist German State.7. However, there may well be a crucial period before the end of the winter.The crisis, if it comes, is likely to begin in the upper ranks of the army and of theAdministration. It is already known that certain generals are bitter in theircriticism of Hitler&apos;s personal conduct of the war. This quarrel may be patchedup owing to the generals&apos; awareness of Hitler&apos;s key-position vis-a-vis the Germanpeople and to their keen sense of discipline. But, if it were not, the regime wouldprobably still be able to anticipate and crush such opposition before the Germanpeople or the outside world was aware of what had happened.8. The interaction of military on civilian morale and vice versa is of vitalimportance in assessing German morale as a whole. At present there are only slight indications that anxiety regarding the state of affairs in Germany ishaving any effect on the fighting qualities of the German armed forces as a whole.9. In the Navy, both officers and men are disturbed by our NortJh Africanoperations and do not now see the way clear for German victory. There is some anxiety about conditions at home but no marked concern over the food prospects.Officers are disposed to grumble about and criticise the youth and inexperienceof their crews, and there is criticism of the same shortcomings in the officers from some of the older petty officers.10. Interrogation of the few Air Force prisoners brought down recentlyover this country as well as of prisonors from North Africa indicates that the morale of G.A.F. flying personnel is still high. Rommel&apos;s defeat at El Alameinis looked upon as a phase in the North African campaign and events in Russiaare not yet interpreted as a German defeat. None the less, there have beenslight indications of the deterioration of the fighting spirit of certain unitsoperating in the West, in failure to press home bombing attacks and apparentindifference to the success of operations.11&apos;.   In the army there is as yet no sign of a decline in morale.
