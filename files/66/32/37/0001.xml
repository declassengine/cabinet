BRIDGES,Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W. 1.23RD DECEMBER,  1942..House of Lords,S.W.1 eDecember 22nd, 19h2.XXXAre you satisfied that Cordell Hull1s phrase &quot;ParentStates&quot; is the best that can he found for the proposed declaration on Colonial Policy?     It seems to me that it mayhereafter be exploited by critics and agitators on behalf of&quot;Children&quot; States.      In what sense is Britain &quot;parent&quot; toHongkong or Jamaica?     &quot;Guardian States&quot; seems to me a saferexpression,  especially as in the future America will castenvious eyes on the West Indies.
