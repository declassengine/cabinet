THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.MOST SECRET. f CoPy No-W.P. (42) 580. &apos;jfDecember 16, 1942.TO BE KE^T^m^ERJ^stock AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.AIR POLICY.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister oe Defence.THE bombing offensive over Germany and Italy must be regarded as ourprime effort in the Air. It is of the utmost importance that this should not fallaway during these winter months, when the strain of the Russian and Anglo-American offensives will be heavy on the German and Italian peoples. Tomaintain a steady crescendo is an offensive measure of the highest consequence.Arrangements have been set on foot*&apos; for raising Bomber Command to50 Squadrons by the end of the year, and all the necessary action has been takento ensure that this target is in fact reached.2. The United States are persevering with the idea of the daylight bombing of Germany by means of Elying Fortresses and Liberators in formation withoutescort. This policy and our official attitude towards the United States Air Forceand Government about it require examination in two stages. First, what is the truth; secondly, what to say or do about it. The Air Ministry must be careful not to mix these processes. They must not allow purely technical and militaryjudgments to be clouded or distorted by the fear that if the Americans wereoffended by our telling them what we feel to be the truth, Admiral King would get the power to send everything off to the Pacific. Any mixing of the technical and political functions prevents the Cabinet from getting the best service in either.* See W.P. (42) 481. .[24754]
23. The brute fact remains that the American bombers so far have rarelygone beyond the limits of strong British fighter escort. Their bombing of theU-boat bases in the Biscay ports has been ineffectual or at the most has yieldedvery small results. Even when hits have been secured from a high level, the bombs have not penetrated the heavily armoured shelters. A certain amount ofinconvenience may have been caused in these ports, but there has been no appreciable diminution in the number of U-boats using them. They have not sofar dropped a single bomb on Germany. The effect of the American bombingeffort in Europe and Africa, judged by the number of sorties, the number of bombs and the results observed, compared with the very large quantities of men andmaterial involved, has been very small indeed. And this after a year of UnitedStates war.4. On the other hand, it should not be overlooked that the American bombingforce in Great Britain has been continually depleted in the interests of &quot; Torch &quot;;that they make large claims of killing enemy fighters, which, even if reduced toone-third, are still appreciable; that they have sometimes been attacked withoutfighter escort and have given a good account of themselves without disproportionateloss; and finally, that the accuracy of their high-level bombing is remarkable,especially if they are not interfered with at the moment of discharge.5. Listening to all I can hear from every source, I have, during the twomonths of writing this paper, become increasingly doubtful of the daylightbombing of Germany by the American method. The danger of their having all their ammunition teased out of them by minor attacks by enemy fighters increasesWith every mile of penetration. To minimise this they now propose to have one in three (presently it may be one in two) Fortresses carrying no bombs but onlyammunition. This, of course, reduces the effective bomb-load proportionatelywhile not reducing the number of aircraft exposed to danger. Against this mustbe counted any enemy fighters shot down.6., If the American plan proves a failure, the consequences will be grievous.In the first place, it will be a heavy shock to public opinion in America. Inthe second place, American industry is already largely committed, and becoming increasingly committed on a vast scale, to the production of heavy bombers whichare not fitted for night bombing. Thirdly, we shall have brought over and main-tained in this country large numbers of personnel on our best airfields, thusadding to the length of our own attacking journeys without being able to count upon any corresponding return in their assistance in our Air offensive on germany. Many of our airfields in United States occupation are being used forlittle more than training.7. We should, of course, continue to give the Americans every encourage-ment and help in the experiment which they ardently and obstinately wish tomake, but we ought to try to persuade them to give as much aid as possible (a) to sea work, and (&amp;) to night bombing, and to revise their production, includinginstruments, and training for the sake of these objects. I have already in my telegram to Mr. Hopkins and in my conversation with Captain Rickenbacker atthe desire of Mr. Winant put these views forward as tactfully as possible.
8.   There is, of course, the alternative to which I have called attention inmy note to the Chiefs of the Staff on plans and operations in the Mediterranean, .yMiddle East and Near East (W.P. (42),543), that &quot; The United States form,;/of daylight attack would have its best chance in the better weather of the&quot;Mediterranean.&quot;9. All these matters require earnest attention, especially in connection withthe consideration being given by the Chiefs of the Staff to the paper &quot;AnEstimate of the effects of an Anglo-American Bomber Offensive againstGermany &quot; (C.Gv,S. ^42)-37-9--(Q)), since it would clearly be disastrous to under-take the gigantic commitment involved in building up an Anglo-AmericanBomber force of 5,000 to 6,000 heavy bombers without being absolutely sure thatthe American bombers were capable of sustained attack, without disproportionateloss, on Germany.10. The United States have affirmed their decision to produce 82,000 combatplanes in 1943, and the Minister of Production has returned with firm agree-ments regarding the distribution of these aircraft. It will be seen from paragraph 12 of Appendix B of his Report (W.P. (42J-568) that &quot; Every effort is being made to make United States heavy bombers suitable for night bombing.A comparatively simple modification has been evolved which gives reasonable hopeof success. Modification sets are now being tried out both in this country and inAmerica.&quot; This work should be given highest priority and progress reports,made at short intervals.11. In fighter aircraft, qualitative superiority is vital and fashions mustimprove even at some expense in numbers. Technical mastery must be achievedeven at a great cost. A different set of considerations governs the developmentof bomber aircraft. The varying difficulty of the tasks set them enables oldertypes to play a part for longer, though at a greater price in casualties. It mustnever be forgotten that the success of the bomber effort is measured by the weightof bombs discharged. With the fighters it is technical Leadership, and for the bombers, bulk Deliveries. Whereas in fighter aircraft we have enough in hand to look some distance ahead, we are terribly behindhand in Bombing expansion.The maintenance of the bomb deliveries on Germany and their steady increaseare imperative. No alteration should be made in our bomber production which is inconsistent with a steadily rising bomb delivery potential. We cannot, forinstance, slack off for the next six months in order to make a great splash in the -autumn of 1943, or sacrifice 1943 for the sake of 1944 or 1945. The process of bombing has to be continuous and cumulative, and all programmes must conform to it. The Wellingtons must not be prematurely discarded until it can be shownthat concentration upon the Lancasters, which is evidently in itself most desirable,causes no falling-off in bomb deliveries on Germany.&apos; We must scrutinise care-fully the effect on our estimated bomb deliveries on Germany, especially in 1943,of the various proposals for alterations in our heavy bomber programme (see.P. (42)J?26, &quot; Policy for the replacement of the Wellington and the Warwick,&quot; &apos;and W.M. (42) 147th Conclusions, Minute 1, paragraph (b), &quot; Switch off Stirlingand other capacity to the manufacture of Lancasters &quot;).
12. The development of the Fleet Air Arm since the war began has not been satisfactory. F6r nearly two years it has been evident that every aircraft carrierrequires, first and foremost, a section of the highest grade fighter aircraft which can be flown on and off a ship (see my memorandum D.O. (42) 49)r&quot;Thisremains the paramount object, and the highest priority should continue to be: given to the supply of the best fighter types to the carriers. In this I am now prepared to include all carriers, whether armoured, intermediate or auxiliary.I This does not, however, mean that inordinate reserves should be built up all overthe world. However desirable it might be for the Navy to have an outfit of aircraft in every port, we cannot at the present time afford to have a lot of aircraft standing idle. The War Cabinet on the 22nd September (W.M. (42)128th Conclusions, Minute 2) approved the proposals made by the Minister ofProduction regarding the scale of reserves for Fleet Air Arm aircraft.We have to try to find the best compromise between scales that are wastefulof aircraft and carriers idle through lack of them. I propose to keep this matter under periodic review.   Presently we shall be better off.13. The development of the Merchant Aircraft Carriers is also mostimportant as an anti-U-boat weapon.14. In all carriers of the regular and intermediate types, more emphasis should be placed at present upon the proportion of fighters compared with torpedo-carrying planes. (The Admiralty would require a higher ratio of torpedo-carrying planes if the carriers moved East to undertake operations against theJapanese naval units.) We are not inferior in gun-power to the enemy and hissurface ships are not our danger. It is the attack from the Air and by theU-boats that requires tireless attention. The use of the fighter aircraft in largerproportions by our carriers is not a defensive symptom, since its object is to enablethe Fleet to take bolder offensive action.W. S.
