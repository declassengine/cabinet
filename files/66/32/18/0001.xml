2Northern Germany 10/10 cloud was met in two layers, with tops at 7,000 feet.Icing in cloud was experienced. Crews were compelled to. bomb the estimatedposition of the target; half of them reported that they released their bombs overthe target area.   Fifteen aircraft were missing.Genoa (13th/ 14th and 15th/ 16th November).A reliable informant who left Genoa on the 12th November gives thefollowing account of the position there at that date : &quot; The burnt or destroyed areas are so vast that it is useless to attemptto give details of the damage. Seen from a height one has the impression that half the town is destroyed, and in the port almost everything seems tohave been destroyed, burnt or suffered damage.&quot;Among the few exceptions in the port area are the silos, where the grain for Switzerland was stored. Lack of small craft in the port, as a resultof large numbers having been sunk or destroyed, is causing difficulties tothe port authorities.&quot;Much further damage was caused in the raids on the 13th/ 14th and the15th/16th November and another informant who was in Genoa on the19th November reports that practically everything that was worth bombing hadbeen destroyed or burnt. No trams were circulating and railway services werenot operating from the Brignole station. Further fires had been started in theliner Augustus, which now appeared to be completely burnt out.Prints Nos. 1 and 2 show some of the damage.Turin (18th/l9th and 20th/21st November).Full details of results achieved in these raids are not yet available, but it isknown that considerable, damage was done both to the city itself and to theimportant Fiat factory. The Italian communique on the 21st November statedthat the raid on the previous night had caused heavy damage.Italian defences in Turin, as in Genoa, were ineffective and only three of our aircraft were missing from these raids.Results of Previous Raids.Milan.Photographs of Milan show damage, mainly due to fire, in the central partof the city and round the Stazione Geneva. The buildings affected are mostlyindustrial and many factory sheds have been destroyed or damaged, among others, those of the G.E.C. (Electrical Engineering), the Municipal Tramways,Carminat and Toselli (Transport Vehicles), S. A. Siry Chamon (Gasmeters),Gonorand Freres (Warehouses and Garages), Officine Caproni (Aircraft works).In the Stazione Genova the whole of the main building has been severely damaged by fire and blast.It is reported from a very reliable source that since the daylight attack onMilan Italian fighters have flown over the city for the sole purpose of restoringconfidence among the populace, which had been badly shaken by the completeunpreparedness of their city&apos;s defences on the occasion of the daylight attack.Gironde.Photographs reveal that a minesweeper received a direct hit during an attack by Mosquitoes on the 7th November. During the same attack a blockade runnerwas severely damaged. Print No. 3 shows another damaged minesweeper beingtowed stern first.he Creusot.Prints Nos. 4 and 5 cover further parts of the works and it is seen that the rolling mills and iron bar stores are severely damaged. The heavy forgingdepartment and armour plate bending shop have suffered roof damage.All ground reports tell of severe damage and destruction. It seems thatthe only parts of the works to escape were the coppersmith&apos;s and blacksmith&apos;sshops. On the day following the attack two flak trains were brought into theneighbourhood.
Comines.It is reported that during the attack on the 29th August, two bombs hit thetransformer serving the main factory building of the Centrale Electriquede Comines. The damage was considerable and it was expected that the Gentralewould be out of action for some time.Damage to German Railway Services.A reliable source reports that: (i) In the attack on Munich on the 19th/20th September, three electricand one steam locomotive, four small electric and one shuntinglocomotive, twelve passenger coaches and thirty-seven goods truckswere destroyed. One hundred and seventy damaged trucks were sentto the Wagon Repair works.(ii) Since the 1st January, 1942, at Kiel, seventeen locomotives have been destroyed or damaged beyond repair.(iii) Since the 1st January, 1942, in the Nuremberg district, sixteen engines,fifty-one trucks and twenty passenger coaches have been destroyed.The figure for engines is high, owing to a direct hit on the locomotiveshed during the attack on the 28th/29th August.Kiel.Two reports have been received concerning the attack on the13th/14th October. A lock gate at the entrance to the Kiel Canal was badly damaged and not fully repaired until the 3rd November, causing interference withtraffic.   Two flak ships, one of which was being repaired, were hit in the port.Cologne.It is reported that in the attack on the 15th/16th October damage was caused to railway lines and cranes in the Rhine Harbour and to the I. G. Farben chemical works at Leverkusen.Krefeld.A further report states that in the attack on the 2nd/3rd October 500 houses were destroyed or damaged, and two dye factories hit.Mining.The following reports of successes have been received : (i) A ship (295 tons), probably the Finnish Helene, is reported mined offN. Germany in August.&apos; (ii) Mid-September. The empty German tanker Diedenhofem was damagedhv a mine about 100 metres from the coast whilst approaching: DenHelder via the Schulpengat.^iii) 30th September. The aircraft tender Gunther Pluscliow was mined and sunk off Ronne.(iv) 10th October.   A fast motor boat was mined near Buksor Odde (Danishwaters).(v) Between the 4th and the 11th October eleven ships were mined betweenKiel and Danzig, including a large Norwegian tanker.(vi) The Dutch Batavier III (2,687 tons), recently employed as a transportbetween Norway and Germany, was mined and sunk 10 miles S.E. ofOestre Flak in the Kattegat, about the middle of October.(vii) 13th October.   The Danish Emma Marie was mined and sank off Laescin the Kattegat.. (viii) The Norwegian Bess (1,118 tons), which sailed from the Ems about the15th October, had to be towed back next day by four tugs,(ix) 17th October.   The German tug Adolf (169 tons) was mined and sunkin Ebeltoft Bay (N.E. Denmark),(x) 21st October.   The Danish minesweeper D. 1.6 was mined off Fyenstlpved in the Great Belt,(xi) 22nd October.   The Danish motor ferry Sondter Jylland was mined and sunk near Aaro in the Little Belt,(xii) 24th October.   The Danish fishing vessel Else was mined and sunknear Vresen (Great Belt),(xiii) 28th October.   The fishing vessel Piscator was mined and sunk off theSkaw, North Denmark; also the Danish fishing vessel A gnes.[24768] ^ &apos;   .b2
(xiv) A German vessel of 6,000 tons, believed to be the Lauterfels, has been mined and sunk off Borkum.  It is thought that this took place at theend of October or early November,(xv) According to the Swedish radio the Danish tug Juno was mined and sunk off Elsinore (West entrance to the Sound) on the 3rd November.(xvi) On the 18th November the Elsinore/Helsinborg ferry route was closedowing to suspected mining.(xvii) According to the Swedish radio, the steamer Lidingo (5,842 tons) was mined and sunk recently in the Baltic.(xviii) The Gruno has been slightly damaged by a mine, and had to be towedto Delfzijl.The very important train ferry from Sassnitz to Trelleborg has now stoppedrunning as the Swedish authorities will no longer risk their remaining vessels.The&apos; damaged German Deutschland is still under repair and their other ferryice-breaker Starke (mined) has not yet been raised.The main minelaying effort has recently been directed against the ports onthe West coast of France. The primary object of this effort has been to interferewith enemy submarine traffic to and from their main bases, thereby aiding thesafe passage of the great convoys proceeding to North Africa.Another interesting effect has been the holding up of blockade runners outsidethe port of Bordeaux. Whether or not any. casualties have been caused to these important ships by our mines is not known.In addition to what has been achieved on the French West Coast, minelayingoff the Frisians continues to pay a steady dividend. Further information givesevery reason to believe that enemy convoys along this coast are becoming moreand more embarrassed. This in turn must be affecting the supply of raw materials to the heavy industries of the Ruhr.In the Baltic, minelaying has, of necessity, been on a smaller scale, but theenemy are still losing valuable tonnage along the main trade routes of this area.December 12, 1942.A.
