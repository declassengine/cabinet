rW.P* .(48) 584 COPY NO.SECRET16th December, 194261WAR   CABINET(\AERODROME CONSTRUCTIONMemorandum by Minister of Labour and National service the programme of the Air Ministry, besides employing a substantial volume of labour on extensions and additional accommodation to existingaerodromes, of which some 500 are at present in use, includes a considerableamount of new aerodrome consti^ction,     I understand that 120 new aerodromesare at present under construction, 20 are Just starting and sites arc being sought for another 43.    The labour demands for aerodrome construction areheavy and rise to a peak of something like 1,000 men for each site during aperiod of construction amounting to about seven months.The labour requirements for this work have a direct bearing on myability to find the necessary man-power for the Services and munitionsduring 1943, as I am counting on a cut of 225,000 in the number ofbuilding workers (see W.P. (4-2) 539).But apart from meeting the requirements of the Forces, I am very anxious to reduce the demands for building trade labour as I think it is becoming imperative to make some labour available for the repair of the many-thousands of bombed houses,    Many of these houses have only had first aidrepairs and with the continuing dotex-*ioration over two years something mustbe done to improve the housing of the people before next winter.In view of the position outlined above and of the cuts in theRoyal Air Force which will presumably react on the number of aerodromesrequired, I suggest that the programme of aerodrome construction should be immediately reviewed with a view to the exclusion of new projects notimperatively required for reasons of strategy.Eo B.H.Q.514-72 LdLo
