He has selected the following:-8 Armoured Division44 Infantry DivisionThe proposal involves the absorption of all the unitsof these formations against deficiencies elsewhere,except the Division and Brigade Headquarters and fourArmoured Regiments which it is proposed to disband.His detailed proposals are still awaitedo8 Armoured Division is the junior   of the armoured divisions sent to the Middle East, and in fact has never fought as a complete division.44 Division has been selected in preference to50 (Northumbrian) Division and the Highland Division.50 Division has been in the Middle East since May 1941.The other two have only recently arrived.     The Divisionwuich was formed in the Middle East and to which you refer in your minute is 70 Division, which is now inIndia.The selection of the Infantry Division to becannibalised must have been carefully considered byGeneral Alexander and I feel we should accept his recommendation.     He has in fact already, taken pre-liminary steps in this direction.(Signed)   A.P. BROOKE.

Copy, of..Minute from Chief of the Imperial General Staff   -to the Prime. Minister ; dated   14th December., 19420With reference to your minute of the 7th December,1942, in reply to my CIoGoS./P0M./343 dated 4th December,The need for cannibalising two Divisions in theMiddle East is dictated solely by the shortage of man-powerj     An improvement in the .shipping situation wouldnot remove or alter the neodo     Middle East and P.A.I.Care deficient of fighting units of almost all types andin particular of Army Artillery and Signals.      Indian&apos;Divisions are without their complement of BritishbattalionsoThe train of maintaining&apos;the Middle East and india has left L0E9 Divisions at home in little better than cadreforma     It is quite impossible to make up the armies in Middle East and P0A0IrC on their present organ-isation, with the units they lack or to maintain existingunitso      The cannibalisation of one Armoured division and one Infantry Division will enable Middle East andPoAoIsCo  to balance their forces from their own resources.Indian Divisions will be made up with british battalions and the re-organisea   commands will have their quota of Corps and Army units.You will remember that V.CI.G.S,  and D.CI.G.S.discussed the necessity for this cannibalisation with you at the end of October0     Also in your noteCCS. (42) 429 (0)  of 3rd December in paragraph 7 whenestimating requirements in the Mediterranean after a successful TORCH, the elimination of one British infantry and one British Armoured Division was taken into account.That was before the cut in manpower was decided at the163rd Meeting of the War Cabinet,      It was necessary thenand it is even more so now0I agree the breaking up of 44th Division isa serious step but I am convinced there is no way of avoiding it0     General Alexander is most anxious to ,complete this cannibalisation as early as possibleboth because he has already had to take certain pre-iiminary steps for operational reasons and also becausedelay would be undesirable from the morale point of view.I should, therefore^ be grateful to have your agreement to implementing the decisions taken at a very early dated(Signed)    A0P.
