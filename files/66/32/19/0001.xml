A.24769]* W.M. (42) 54th Conclusions (Confidential Annex).
3. There are various categories of accommodation which are specificallyexempted from earmarking and which Departments are asked to avoid takingexcept with the consent of the responsible Authority. This list is circulatedand kept up to date by the Ministry of Works and Departments should be careful, to observe the procedure. Although hotels do not figure on the list itwill be obvious that the requisitioning of hotels, particularly in certainindustrial towns, leads to great inconveniences to all business people and toGovernment representatives who have to visit these towns on official business.There should always be a certain proportion of hotel beds left available in everytown and Departments should, therefore, avoid, if possible, the requisitioning of hotels. In case of doubt as to whether a hotel should or should not be taken over, application should be made to the Ministry of Works, who will investigate the accommodation position in the light of local requirements.4. It is in connection with the requisitioning of the premises of businessfirms and the houses of private occupants that the major hardship is likely to occur. All Departments should observe the same principles in selectingaccommodation for requisitioning and apply, so far as possible, a uniformstandard in applying the principles. They should look to the Ministry of works to ensure that common principles for the selecting of accommodation areavailable for the guidance of Departments and that the co-ordination necessaryfor uniformity is available. When people have been turned out once from theirpremises it would be obviously in very special circumstances only that another department should impose on them the hardship of having to turn out a second time. Where this is inevitable Departments should give the turned-out tenantsuch assistance as they can in finding new accommodation.5. Departments, whether Service or Civil, which have different branchesinterested in the acquisition of accommodation, should avoid repeated visits of inspection by different representatives prior to requisitionng. Equally, Depart-ments without regional representatives in certain districts should apply to theMinistry of Works Senior Regional Officer for assistance either in finding orinspecting accommodation. In all districts the experience of Ministry of Workslocal officers is at the disposal of all Departments. In particular, departments should, so far as possible, avoid the inspection of premises earmarked by otherDepartments without prior consultation with the earmarking Department or theappropriate regional representative of the Ministry of Works and Planning. Ifthere is any reason to believe that the earmarking of particular premises shouldbe revised, the attention of the Ministry of Works should be drawn to them.6. Premises normally used for Factory or Storage purposes and garages areallocated by the Board of Trade in consultation with the Departments concernedwith full regard for the principles laid down in the preceding paragraphs. Theprocedure is different since there is, in general, no earmarking. If, however,premises are not specifically built for factory and storage purposes, the ear-marking procedure set out in the preceding paragraphs should be followed beforethe Regional Controller of Factory and Storage Premises is asked to issueauthority to acquire. (Departments will be informed in due course of the pro-cedure to be followed in regard to the use of shop premises released by the Boardof Trade, which is at present under discussion between that Department and theMinistry of Works and Planning.)7. Departments sponsoring Local Authorities who exercise delegatedrequisitioning powers should make sure that they observe the principles and pro-cedure laid down above. These Local Authorities should be reminded that theMinistry of Works is the co-ordinating authority for all accommodation require-ments, and in cases of doubt they should apply for guidance through the SeniorRegional Officers of the sponsoring Departments.
