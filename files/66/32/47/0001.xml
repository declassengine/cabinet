2The Works consist of two separate factories, both of the highest importance toGermany, producing nearly l/3rd of the radio valves manufactured in Europe.It is believed, that they were particularly engaged in working on experimentalradio equipment to counter our new protective devices against German nightdefences.-The fact that even the less important valve factories in France have been pressed into working at full capacity to meet the requirements of the Axis forcesillustrates further the importance of closing down this primary source of supply.3. The attack was a complete success. Although no accurate damageassessment has been possible from the available photographs, the following factorybuildings were photographed burning fiercely during and immediately after the attack :  Industrial School.Workshops.Component Factory.Boiler House.Mechanical Glassworks.Power Station.Bakelite Factory.Lamp and Valve Factory (South End).4. The above is all that can be definitely ascertained so far. It is, however,certain that fuller photographic cover will reveal damage on a much larger scale.Prints 1-6 attached were taken during the attack.Some 13,000 workers were employed at these works. The attack took place at the lunch hour on a Sunday, in order to reduce casualties to a minimum.German propaganda claims that 109 people in all were killed by the bombing.Mannheim (6th/7th December).5. A&apos;force of 273 aircraft was despatched. Visual identification wasimpossible, owing to cloud over the target, and it is unlikely that any great successwas achieved.Turin (8tli/9th, 9th/10th and llth/12th December).6. The raids on 8th/9th and 9th/ 10th were highly successful. On thefirst weather over the target was good, with no cloud, but a slight haze; theriver and town were clearly identified and the attack well concentrated. On thesecond, thick haze or smoke made pinpointing more difficult, and the opening-phase of the attack was somewhat scattered. In the later stages, however, heavyconcentration on the centre of the town was achieved.The attack on 11th/12th was less successful. Weather conditions en routewere exceptionally difficult. Severe icing was experienced, with 8/10 to 10/10cloud from 12,000 to 22,000 feet from the French coast to the target. A few breakswere found over Turin, but accurate pinpointing was impracticable, and fewaircraft were successful in locating and bombing the target.7. No adequate photographic cover of the results of these attacks has yetbeen obtained. Some small-scale prints taken on 11th/12th, however, confirm that heavy damage has been done. This is chiefly concentrated in the West part ofthe inner town; the area North of the town centre has also suffered severely. no fresh large areas of devastation are seen, but the number of serious incidentscaused by both H.E. and fire is very large.8. Damage was done in particular to the factories of S.A. Mazzonis Manni-fattura (Cotton Weaving Mill), S.A. Fiat (Land Armament and Steel Foundry),Aeritalia (Fiat Airframe Factory). It is noticeable that the factories in theWestern suburbs show no sign of activity.A-large hangar on the aerodrome has been.destroyed. Print 7, taken on the7th December, shows part of the damage effected before these three raids.Fallersleben (7th/18th December).9. On the night of 7th/18th December a low level attack on a number of towns in North-West Germany was planned, with a view to taking such advantageas possible of prevailing weather conditions. The principal objective was theOpel Works at Fallersleben.    It appears that some 30 of the 49 aircraft\
despatched on this operation succeeded in bombing the various targets assigned to them. Losses incurred were considerable. The cause of these is underinvestigation.Results of Previous Raids.10. In the absence of adequate photographic cover, no new detailed information is available.Turin.11. A reliable source reports that construction of Macchi 202&apos;s has beenheld up as a result of shortage of engines owing to damage caused in our attacks.12. Another source states that the repeated attacks have been most effective and make attempts at reorganisation most difficult. The effect on the population is noticeable, as they ha,ve been unwilling to co-operate in reorganisation, a task which they consider hopeless.Stuttgart.13. Apart from damage to the railway station, which is confirmed by photo-graphs, the following account of damage has been received from ground sources : (a) One brewery destroyed and heavy damage to industrial and private property at Vahingen, Mohringen and Birkach.(&amp;) Severe damage to a considerable proportion of the Mauser works atOberndorf.Italy.14. A most reliable source reports that, although the Italian authoritiesstill have the situation in hand, they are greatly disturbed by the attitude of thepopulation, especially the workers, and apprehensive as to the probable resultsof continued bombing. In the Italian motor industry, by the 9th December, theLancia output was considered to have been reduced by 35 per cent, and that ofFiats by 12 per cent. The authorities are now issuing drastic orders to preventstoppage of work at all factories whenever air raid warnings are sounded, but whether these will be effective remains to be seen.It is reported that the Germans have sent some Flak batteries to Milan in fulfilment of their promise to protect the Italians from the R.A.F. Heavymovements of German troops over the Brenner into Italy are also reported.Germany.General.15. An interesting example of the lack of household facilities is learnt fromthe newspaper Bremer Nachrichten of the 24th November in an article headed&quot;Assistance for the Bombed Out.&quot; It is stated that the National EconomyDepartment (housekeeping section) wished as far as possible to grant facilitiesfor baking Christmas cakes to bombed-out housewives who had no oven of theirown and could not use a neighbour&apos;s oven. Application had to be made in personwith particulars of the kind of cakes to be baked.Mining.16. A total of 634 mines has been laid in December up to the 20th. Thefollowing reports of successes have been received : (i) The La Digue of Bordeaux has been blown up and sunk.    Positionunknown.(ii) On the 19th September a Swedish minesweeper was sunk off Helsingborg.(iii) On the 1st October the Norwegian A rng, of 4,325 tons, was sunk off the entrance to Swinemunde.(iv) The merchant ship Assistent was mined and sank in the Great Belt onthe 13th November.(v) An unidentified vessel named the Dannevirke was mined and damagedon the 18th November in the Little Belt,(vi) The   German   steamer   Duisburg   was   mined   and   sank   on   the19th November in Aalborg Bay.&apos;[24827] b 2
(vii) The Swedish vessel Urania, of 628 tons, was mined and sank on the23rd November at the North entrance to the Sound.(viii) The Swedish wireless on the 28th November announced that the three-masted schooner Thai had been blown up on the night of the 27th/28th November in the Western Baltic.(ix) The Swedish wireless on the 29th November stated that the motor sailingship Maj had been damaged by a mine and that the vessel was sinking.No position was given.(x) The Swedish wireless on the 2nd December reported that wreckagemarked Gustav had been washed up on the Swedish coast, north ofMalmo, and it appears that the vessel was mined on the Danish sideof the Sound. The vessel in question is believed to be the DanishGustav of 254 tons.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, December 30, 1942.
