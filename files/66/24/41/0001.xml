KiwiTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,   May 1942..Copy No.fTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK A^rjf KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-SOVIET  RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a despatch from His Majesty&apos;ambassador to the Norwegian Government recording a conversation with theNorwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the Anglo-Soviet Treaty negotiations and the possibility of a separate peace between the Soviet Union and Germany.I think M. Lie&apos;s views deserve attention.A. E.Foreign Office, May 18, 1942.ANNEX.Mr. Collier to Mr. Eden.(No. 23.   Confidential.) British Legation to Norivay,Sir, . May 8, 1942.I HAVE the honour to report that when I called upon the norweigen minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday his Excellency made certain remarksabout the Soviet Union which may be of interest to you.2. M. Lie said that he was well aware that negotiations for some form ofpolitical understanding were now in progress between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Soviet Government, and that in these negotiations the Soviet Governmentwere opening their mouths very wide indeed, requiring, among other things, a virtual recognition of their 1941 frontiers, at least as regards Finland, theBaltic States and Bessarabia. The Polish Minister to Norway, M. Neumann, had urged him to intervene in this matter, pointing out the danger as a precedent,as well as the intrinsic injustice, of recognising the Soviet claim to the baltic states; and he suspected that similar Polish approaches had been made to theother European Allies. He had told M. Neumann, however, that he would have nothing to do with this. As the representattive of a small nation, he certainlycould not approve the sacrifice of the Baltic States; and he was glad that he wasnot called upon to do so. At the same time, however, he would not like to takethe responsibility of telling His Majesty&apos;s Government that they ought not totake this or any other step, if they really thought it necessary for winning thewar. The Russians were unaccountable people; and what he had heard fromthe Norwegian Minister at Kuibyshev, as well as from other sources, made himfeel somewhat uneasy as to their future attitude.3. M. Lie then showed me several telegrams in Norwegian from M. Andvord,the gist of which was that it was now generally believed, and not by the Russians11717   [23832]SECRET.W.P. (42) 211.May 18, 1942.
alone, that whatever successes Hitler might score against the Soviet armies this summer he would not be able to knock them out, but must contemplate anotherwinter campaign. This was really equivalent to the loss of the war; and thepossibility could not be excluded that, rather than face that, Hitler would executeanother political volte-face and offer Stalin the 1941 frontiers as the price of aseparate peace. Stalin, for his part, was clearly displeased at the failure of theAllies to open up a second front to help him, and was afraid of a Japanese attack in the Far East; and if there was still no second front this summer and his political demands were not met, he might be tempted to accept the offer, calcula-ting that the war would still go on elsewhere, that Hitler would never again dareto attack him while it lasted, and that he would then be in a better position than ever for imposing his will upon Europe at the end of hostilities.4. M. Lie admitted that these unpleasant developments were possibilitiesonly, not probabilities; but they were so unpleasant that he could not blame HisMajesty&apos;s Government for attempting to conjure them by any means in their power. The best means, of course, would be the immediate opening of a.second front; if that were done there would be no need for any political concessions,and he sincerely hoped that it would be done in the near future. If it was not contemplated, however, and he could see as yet no sign that it was, then there seemed nothing for it but to meet the Soviet Government more than half-way on political questions.I have, &amp;c.L. COLLIER.
