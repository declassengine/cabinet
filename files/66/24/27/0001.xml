: DRAFT &quot;/HITS PAPER.FUEL RATIONING. &apos;His Majesty4s Government, after full consideration of the views expressed in- the Debate in the House?, of Commons on 7th May, have decidedorf the following scheme of fuel rationing,(1) In order to secure ah equitable distribution of fuel, as well asa necessary reduction in the total domestic consumption, all consumersmust be registered with a coal merchant or distributor.     An Order to this effect has already been made, ..   This will enable available supplies of coal and coke to be distributed between merchants roughly in proportion to thenumber of their registered custoraers*       .(2) There will be a fuel ration for each household, and, in addition,a fuel ration for each person, including children,(3) The ration will be fixed in cwt. of coal.     But a consumer oantake part of his ration in other fuels - coke, gas, electricity or paraffin,These will be interchangeable according to a points system on the basis that -1 cwt, of coal or coke equals 5 therms of gas or 100 units of electricity or    gallons of paraffin,..   (4) The-household ration will be fixed   for each household by an &apos;assessment of present needs according to a simple scale as shown below, .The ration will depend on .-... (;a) The locality of the household, - For. olimatio reasons, a higher&apos;, /scale will be given for Scotland and the North of-England than-for the Midlands which In turn will have a higher&apos; scale than-  London and&apos; the South. -(b) The number of habitable rocsns in the house,&apos;(c) In the case of houses with more than seven habitable rooms, the ..      number of residents.    .   .The making of these assessments will be a very simple matter involvingno exercise of judgment by any official, but only the tabulation of- facts,85 per cent.&apos; of all households contain seven habitable rooms or less.(5) The personal ration will be the same for all persons whether youngor old.     It will be 7-g- cwt, a year per head.     Thus a family of four - : 1persons will be entitled to   a total personal ration of 1-g- tons in additionto their household ration.       / &apos; ;(6) .A&apos; supplementary ration may also be given for special needs, suchas isickness&apos;: necessitating additional fuel, bqmb damage, the use of a house for. business premises, etc.     These supplementary rations will-be granted by the Local Fuel Overseer,     They are the&apos;orily part of the ration which requires the exercise-of discretion by any official, and even this will be largely reduced by the issue of simple rules dealing with the most common(-7)? The question of miners&apos; coal will be specially dealt.with, after full consultation with representatives of minprs and mine - owners.     Thepossibility of substituting money payments for\part of the coal now receivedby the miners will be-considered,,      .(8) Any householder applying for a supplementary ration who is not satisfied with the decision of the Local Fuel, Overseer, will, in accord with rules to be made by the Board of Trade, have a rightsof appeal.
(?) Sick,persons, or those over 65 years of age, will have the option of exchanging some of their clothing coupons for additional fuel rations.For the: sick, this option is additional to the possibility of a supplementary-ration under (6),(10) The rationing period for coal, coke and paraffin will begin on thei5tU June 1942 and will run to the 15 th June 1943.     All coal, ooke andparaffin delivered to the householder on or after 15th June 1942 will count against his ration for these twelve months.     Likewise, any stocks of coalor coke in excess of one ton held on 15th June 1942 will count against the ration.     Within the limits of their ration, householders will be encouraged to stock up during the summer months.(11) The rationing peripd for gas and electricity will also run fromapproximately 15th June, i,&apos;e, from the first quarterly meter reading after15th September.(l2) During any half year^ electricity consumption in any household mustnot exceed the consumption in&apos;the&quot; corresponding six months of&quot; the previous year, except with the consent of the Supply Company, the consumer to have aright of appeal to the Local Fuel Overseer, if consent is withheld,1  (13)/The sale, except under licence, of gas and electric domesticapplianc/es has been prohibited - an Order to this effect was made by theBoard of Trade on&quot; - such appliances includingeverything except appliancesJfor lighting and radio,(1,4) Any small excess, of; consumption of electricity or gas, over theamounts&apos; permitted unde^either (3) or (12), will be reported to the LocalFuel Overseer and carried forward and deducted from the ration in the nextperiod.     Any larger excess may be subject, on the initiative of the LocalFuel Cverseer, to\ prosecution and a maximum, fine oft say, ten times the priceper ;on it of the exbess,     Iii cases of flagrant and deliberate excess, supplieswilj be cut off k if so ordejfred by the Court,     It is not anticipated that suohcages will be at all commonl&apos;&apos; (15) Establishments, i,is buildings other than domestic or industrial premises *\vi * boarding schools, hospitals, hotels and boarding houses, business offices,shops, restaurants and places of entertainment, etc,, will be rationed on thebasis of their consumption ,bf fuel in a preceding period.     The amount of thereduction will be determined by the Local Fuel Overseer with a right of appeal,f I \In addition to rationing, establishments will be subject to restrictionsdirected to prevent extravagant or unnecessary   use of heat and light.An Order restricting advertisement lighting as nnde by the Board ofTr$de today,(16) Fuel rationing can 6nly operate fairly and effectively by means ofdoupons, but steps will be taken to minimise any inconvenience which the use; of these may cause.     Each householder will have a ration book from whichcoupons will be detached.     Farther, each person receives a clothing rationbook by 1st June and may use any of the 15 spare coupons which it contains topurchase -g- cwt, of coal or the equivalent of other fuels.     This is the personalration mentioned in (5) above, A ,.-Coupons will only be required to be handed over for gas and eL$ctricity,7/hen payment is made by cash or1 cheque.     For solid fuel coupons may. ifpreferred, be deposited with the order.     But otherwise coupons wi^ll always gowith the money.     This will remove many difficulties.     Thus meter, Readers will only need to collect coupons when they collect cash.     All alternative arrangement which have been suggested^are njore cumbrous and more open to evasion and fraud,In order to save labour for the gas and. electricity companies arrangements should be made whereby the same person reads &quot;both the gas and electricity meters.Such an arrangement is already in force as between the Gas Light and CokeCompany and the County of London Electric Supply Company,
(17) It is estimated that a permanent staff required throughout thecountry for the administration of fuel rationing will mean, on an average,ar addxtion of two or three persons for each of the 1,600 Local FuelOffices.     That is to say, an addition of some 4,000 in all, includingnoad quarters staff.Further, for a period of six weeks to two months, some 10,000temporary clerks will be required at the Local Fuel Offices to makeassessments for household rations and to issue the household ration books.Most of this temporary staff would be &quot;borrowed, under the existing arrangements for dovetailing staff between Government Departments, fromthe Ministry of Food.     They will just have completed their work on foodration books and will, therefore, be available daring July and Augustfor similar work on fuel rationing.     The great majority of the staff,&quot;hot1; permanent a\nd temporary, will consist of girl clerks, with semeo&apos;.&apos;.doi\Tv persons.     Some temporary staff will also be drawn from CivilDeforce Services.)(1-3) In support, and in explanation of fuel rationing there will be asnetair^ed campaign of publicity and education.     The Prime Minister willinitiate this campaign by a broadcast and the wireless will thereafter be constantly us,ed.     There will be an educational campaign in fuel economyamong householders;in methods of reducing and controlling their consumption by saving waste, and reading their gas and electric meters.     An AdvisoryCommittee on publicity including- representatives of consumers and of theindustides will be set up,(19) The following is a provisional scale of household rationsexpressed in terms of coal, to which must be added both the personalrations of all members of the household index- (5) and any supplementaryrations under (6).  &apos;,T   i        o Scotland and --^oTiL-o&quot;                MidlandsEngland&quot; .   - .cwt. of coal per year1 40 &apos;&quot;&apos;             30 252 45 40 303 55 45 354 60 55 405 70 .60 456 75 65 507 85 70 55Thus thrs total ration for a five roomed house-with four people, eachof when is entitled to 7i cwt. a year as personal ration, would be 5? tonsin the Northt 4*- tons in the Midlands, J.f tons in the South.     Anysupplementary ration would be additional to these figures.The larger houses with eight rooms or more will not receive a largerration than the seven roomed houses, unless they have sufficient residentsto justify it,    or there are other special circumstances.     The general principle is that   an extra room over seven should only count if there areat least four residents, over eight if there are at lease five, and so on.The additional amount allowed per room, subject to these conditions for larger houses, should be 15 cwt, in Scotland and the North, 12^ cwt. in theMidlands, and 10 cwt. on the South,     As an alternative.if the householdersatisfies the Local Fuel Overseer that his previous consumption was notunduty high, it will not be cut by more than 33i Per cent.These scales will, it is- estimated, produce the total saving required,and      will involve no reduction for about a quarter of the total household.The remaining three-quarters will receive rations less than their presentconsumption,
(20) The scheme is a simple one and the duties of the ordinaryhouseholder may be summed up as follows:-(i) Register with a supplier for coal and for coke, if hehas not already done so.(ii) Fill in the application form which will be sent to him and return it to the Local Fuel Office. The questions that he will have to answer are outlined in (21) below.(iii) Collect his household fuel ration book from the Local FuelOffice.(iv) Give up coupons for all coal, coke and paraffin bought after15th June 1942, and for gas and electricity used quarter byquarter starting with the first meter reading after 15thSeptember, 1942,(21) Outline of the householders application form.1,   Householder&apos;s full name...............................National Registration Number ..........................Full Postal Address of Premises .......................2.
