Tiii3 Document to the PjajQSty&apos;s GovernmentTO BE KEPT UND&apos;It te requested that specaitstf*3 the secrecj110lument.- WARNET,P. (.42)195-h May, 194-2.u.o.d.R.CopMemorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.I circulate herewith new drafts of the two proposedtreaties with the Soviet Union (annexes A and B).draf t^frrjtcxT the Soviet Ambassador nresenleOoSr on theIT^r^pril.     They represent the minimum of what our requirements must be.Where it has .been found necessary to alter theSoviet draft, the Soviet wording is in brackets.\7here it has been necessary to add to the Sovietdraft the words are underlined.I would call particular attention to the underliningsin the Preamble, in Article 1 and in Article 5 (b)..Provided that we obtain the addition to the preamble, itis for consideration whether we might not abandon the  /additions in Article 1 and Article 5.It will be noticed that I have, to meet the wishes of the Soviet Government, omitted ail reference to thePolish frontiers in the draft Political Treaty.     Butthis is only possible on condition that our reservation,in its original wording, is reproduced unmodified in ajoint declaration or exchange of notes attached to theTreaty and enjoying equal validity with the Treaty.Similarly I have felt it necessary to sacrifice theprovision for which President Roosevelt had ashed, to theeffect that the inhabitants of the Baltic States shouldhave the right to emigrate.For convenience of reference I attach our own formerdrafts with which I opened negotiations with M. Maisky(Annexe C).     The more important provisions which do notappear in our new minimum drafts are underlined.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,May 6 th, 19-12.
