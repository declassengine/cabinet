Evatt, London.(Immediate.  Most Secret.)MacArthur states that as the further attempt of the Japanese to&quot; movesouthwards has been frustrated in the recent engagement in the Coral Sea, it isof vital importance to build up and maintain adequate&apos; strength to repulse anyfurther attacks of this nature. He observes that the essential backbone of the striking power in this action was the aircraft carriers of the task forces which do not belong to his command, but only entered it for this operation. I hopethere is a full realisation in London and Washington of the grave threat withwhich we were confronted last week. We knew the strength of the enemyconcentration, we knew his intentions and we knew the prospective date of hisattack, yet we were unable to marshal the superior strength to deal him a heavyblow, and the whole of his convoy of twenty-four transports fell back on &quot;Rabaulunscathed. Fortune will not continue to favour us with these opportunities ifwe do not grasp them.[23830]
2. MacArthur says that the immediate objective is to provide in theSouth-West Pacific Area Naval, Land and Air Forces to make it secure as aspringboard for ultimate offensive action, and he has cabled to the Presidentthrough General Marshall a statement of his conception of the probable courses of action open to the Japanese, the best means of frustrating them and theadditional forces necessary for the defence of Australia. These consist of thefollowing additional forces :- Navy. Two aircraft carriers.Army. An Army Corps of three divisions fully trained and equipped for operations.Air Forces. A first-line strength of 1,000 aircraft.3. I find that MacArthur is in general agreement with the views we havebeen expressing since the outbreak of the war with Japan and all of which Ihave mentioned earlier. However, I would resummarise them as the basis onwhich, as you suggest, we as a Government must ceaselessly argue untilMacArthur is satisfied that he has at least the minimum for his immediateobjectives. His only point of difference from our own Chiefs of Staffs earlierappreciations is the- statement that without adequate naval and air powertwenty-five divisions are necessary for the defence of Australia. He says that ifthe enemy has superior naval and air power no land forces will be adequate, andthat air power, both sea-borne and land-based, is a vital necessity.4. The following is a restatement of the Australian Governmentsviewpoint :  (i) Japan, by carefully prepared advances and methodical acquisition of air bases to cover the next step, has acquired extensive areas and established herself in French Inclo-China, Flong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, the netherlands east Indies, Burma and New Guinea. She has secured access to vital sources ofsupply. Her main naval strength is still intact. Her land-based aircraft inarchipelagos and narrow waters are a formidable deterrent to naval operations in these regions.(ii) The defeat and capture of the forces in the areas attacked, with theretreat of those in Burma, will free for further operations the Japanese forcesemployed over a wide area. The indifferent or in some cases the co-operativeattitude of native populations to Japanese occupation has relieved Japan of theobligation of maintaining large garrisons to prevent insurrection or to combatguerrilla activities. Japan is therefore in a position to regroup her forces andselect her next objectives.(iii) There would appear to to be no grounds for assuming that she will relaxher offensive. She is a partner of the Axis and it is to her interest to co-operate in the defeat and destruction of the United Nations.(iv) As to the probable direction or directions in which Japan will move, the mandated Islands, with their naval and air bases, afford a substantial measureof defence to her eastern flank until they are captured by amphibious operations.Within the area now controlled by her, Japan is able to follow her earlier practiceof concentrating superior force at the point of contact and she is able to launch a powerful attack against the South-West Pacific Area.(v) A similar scale of attack on India cannot be made from a comparativelysecure position in so far as bases are concerned, as the line of communication inthe Indian Ocean is as much more vulnerable to a flank attack. Also, there wouldbe a dispersion of naval strength west and east of Singapore v/hich wouldhandicap the concentration of the Japanese fleet to cope with a fleet action bythe United States fleet in the Pacific Ocean. The circumstances for an offensive against India are not so favourable for a successful outcome as those against theSouth-West Pacific Area.(vi) It would therefore appear from the Japanese point of view that thesoundest course would be to move against the South-West Pacific Area first and leave India alone until the results of these operations are ascertained.(vii) In view of this probable course of action that is open to the enemy it isof vital importance to ensure that the forces in the South-West Pacific Area are sufficient to ensure its successful defence. As General Wavell said whenCommander-in-Chief of the A.B.D.A. Area, the Japanese drive must be stoppedby making a stand and fighting him somewhere.   Australia, with its manpower
and resources, is the last area in the South-West Pacific where this is possible. if at the same time Japanese home territory, overseas bases and lines of communication-tion can be regularly raided, the maximum defensive-offensive will be developed.The defensive position having been secured, an offensive strategy can be adopted as soon as the necessary forces are gathered.(viii) The advantages of this course of action are several. It would ensurethe security of the South-West Pacific Area. It would be the best means of protecting India. It would provide a second front for assistance to the Russiansby relieving pressure on Siberia and releasing forces for use on the Europeanfront or by enabling Russia to join with the United Nations in the early defeat of Japan, when the entire effort could be concentrated on Germany. Finally,a large-scale offensive can be staged more easily and quickly in the South-west pacific Area than in any other area.(ix) If Japan should move in force against Australia and obtain a footholdas threatened to occur last week with the Coral Sea action it may be too late tosend assistance. Possibly, in the long run the territory might be recovered, butthe country may have been ravished and the people largely decimated. Historywould gravely indict such a happening to a nation which sacrificed 60.000 ofits men on overseas battlefield in the last war and at its peril has sent its Naval,Military and Air Forces to fight overseas in this one. In the defence of Britain,after the fall of France, there still remained the Navy and Air Force to repel theinvader and the Air Force did so. Australia is not so favourably placed. It isa vast territory with poor communications, a small Naval Squadron, a relatively small Army, neither adequately equipped nor fully trained, and a small AirForce. With superior sea power the enemy can bring to bear superior force and can sever or seriously harass the lines of communication for overseas supplies.It is imperatively and vitally urgent to strengthen this base while time and circumstances permit.(x) The defence of the South-West Pacific Area is an obligation of the united nations, who have approved the directive of the Commander-in-Chief andappointed him to the supreme command. It devolves on them to provide theforces required.. Australia is developing its maximum potential but it is not sufficient, as the Commander-in-Chief has already stated. The deficiency must come from elsewhere and come quickly.
