THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty  &apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1942.SECRET.Copy No.W.P- (32) 180.April 28, 1942.WAR CABINET.MORALE IN FRANCE AND FRENCH NORTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Tangier covering a report by the United States Military Attache thereon the state of morale in France and North Africa.I would draw special attention to the evidence in this report of the depressinginfluence of the Vichy Administration on morale in the territories which itcontrols, and the contrary effect of Nazi methods in the Occupied Zone.(No. 122.   Confidential.)Sir Tangier, April 6, 1942.&apos; I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a confidentialreport, dated the 23rd March, which has been forwarded by Lieutenant-ColonelBentley, United States Military Attache at Tangier, to the War Department atWashington.2. Colonel Bentley was, before his appointment to Tangier, AssistantMilitary Attache to the United States Embassy in Rome. He has therefore had some opportunity of observing the conditions obtaining under a totalitarianregime. Furthermore, Colonel Bentley has, since he has been in Tangier,travelled extensively throughout the French territories in North Africa, and heis therefore qualified by personal observation to report on the nefarious police andGestapo methods which are now being exercised by the Vichy Government inthese territories. In so far as I have been able to observe from the extremelylimited confines of Tangier, the picture which Colonel Bentley paints is not an over-coloured one. Even here in the Tangier Zone, which, it is to be hoped onlytemporarily, is under the Spanish yoke, a similar atmosphere to that portrayedby Colonel Bentiey obtains in so far as the French colony is concerned. Thespying by Frenchman on Frenchman is rife in Tangier, and it is in great measure for this reason that no Frenchman dares to venture within the gates of thisConsulate-General unless it be on an approved mission in connexion with officialbusiness. My French friends here hardly dare to exchange the customary saluta-tions when we meet in the street, and it is only a very few who will willingly enterinto conversation with British subjects in public places.A.

3. The chief interest of Colonel Bentley&apos;s report lies in the comparisonwhich he draws between the atmosphere of occupied Fr ance on the one hand, andthat of unoccupied France and French North Africa on the other. All the reports which become available to us concerning public opinion in occupied France goto show that at least 95 per cent, of the feeling in that area is in favour of an allied victory. Those who must live under the German heel now realise to thefull all that that implies. Despite the machinations of trade at. Doriot, Laval,Luchere and the other members of that small clique of Germanophile politicians&apos;journalists and business men who work from Paris, despite also the ceaselessGerman propaganda put out by the French ;&apos; controlled &quot; press and radio andin all kinds of other ways, the overwhelming majority of the people of the occupied Zone live only for their day of liberation, which they realise can onlycome about by the victory of the Allies. On the other hand, in the unoccupiedarea and perhaps especially in the overseas territories which have not yet beensubmitted to the horrors of war, the situation is different. The Vichy Govern-ment&apos;s policy of &quot; collaboration and hesitation,&apos;&quot; coupled no doubt with pressure from the Germanophile business circles and the French Legion, have broughtabout such a state of fear and suspicion as must render life intolerable for anyFrenchman worthy of the name. Nevertheless, I am told that such places asMarrakesh, Eabat, Casablanca and other towns in French Morocco are filled with french refugees of the wealthy classes from Paris and occupied France, whoseone aim is to keep as far away from war as possible. These people are for themost part spineless pleasure-seekers. They are devoid of patriotic feelings, andwould probably welcome any settlement which would permit of a quiet andcomfortable life. Their understanding of the German peril and of what futureGerman domination of Europe would mean has not been awakened, or if it has, ithas been anaesthetized by the dictates of Vichy and by the false sense of security in which they live. If the war came to Morocco, the French inhabitants of the zone would be of little use to the Allies. They would submit at once to a displayof German force.4. Given that the situation is as bad as Colonel Bentley makes it out to be(and I believe that it is), and the contrast so impressive between the occupied andunoccupied portions of France, it is difficult to see how, at the end of hostilitieswhich we all hope and believe will be a happy one for the Allies, the French nationwill be able to reaffirm its position in the world without first experiencing themost serious internal upheaval. The repatriated Gaullists and the inhabitants of those parts of France which have been under German domination will find itdifficult to reconcile themselves to collaborating with those of their own blood who in Unoccupied France and in French North Africa have done, and are doing, somuch to sell their country to the enemy.5.

Deterioration of French Morale.The conditions in which France is living, and the form in which the vichy government is trying to reconstruct its Government have already produced manytendencies in unoccupied France and in the French colonial dominions which areanalogous to certain characteristics of life in Nazi and Fascist countries. in trying to overcome the terrific blow which in a few weeks shattered the french army and broke the French will, French leaders in Vichy have, consciously orunconsciously, aped and adapted to their own use many of the Nazi regimenta-tions whose success in creating the German war machine broke the French nation.It is but a logical step for the slave to endeavour to adopt some of the successfulpolicies of the master, but the growing effects of these new theories and desireson the French masses are serving to stifle those very liberties and desires onwhich the French Republic was founded. The emphasis on regimentation ofthoughts and actions, the organisation and political training of youth, the denialby the Marshal to the French of their rights of self-criticism all these are havinglamentable effects on the morale and on the fortitude of the French people in north African territories.The recent organisation in North Africa of a secret police operating overand above the ordinary French police, and referred to by the man in the streetas the Vichy Gestapo, is a terrible climax of the Vichy endeavours. These secret service men, reported to number more than 200, have been sent to North Africafrom Vichy with orders to report directly to their superiors in Vichy. It is currently rumoured that the recent visit to North Africa by Minister of theInterior Pucheu was, among other things, to organise and supervise the establish-ment of this secret police service, of which he is the head. There are alreadymany agents in the Moroccan and Algerian police organisations who areencouraged to denounce as many people as possible, some having been known to admit that they are afraid not to bring a political accusation against at least one person daily. The horrible atmosphere of fear is growing daily in French north africa, caused by this insidious system which makes every man spy on hisneighbour with the excuse that in so doing he is serving the State.France is throttling herself and her people in accordance with Vichy1 sendeavours not to upset the applecart and to do nothing or permit nothing thatwill bring further, pressure from their German masters.Having been two years in Europe, first in Italy and now in North Africa,I have been living with and seeing daily the work and effects of Axis intriguesand propaganda on the various European nationalities. In Rome I have seen and known intelligent Germans and Italians who only two years ago damnedHitler, Mussolini and all their works, but due to the incessant pressure of thepeople round them, the daily pounding of the Axis radio and the constantrepetition in the carefully censored newspapers, changed their loyalties andbeliefs to the point where they began to view Hitler and Mussolini as the savioursof their countries. When this happens to educated intelligent people after ayear or so it is easier to understand how rapidly the masses undergo their trans-formation and rapidly reflect in thoughts and actions the tenor of their controlledpress.To-day we see the French peoples beginning to yield their will under thesame constant pressure. It is terrible to see the daily spread of this insidiousfear, to know Frenchmen whose relatives were machine-gunned by the Germansbut who to-day are afraid to speak a word against the Germans even in theprivacy of their own houses. This growing system of surveillance has its firsteffects, of course, among the masses and Vichy may think that its new rules are merely a self-discipline which all Frenchmen must bear to pay for the errorsbefore the war. The effects, however, of these many rules, regulations,regimentations and denunciations are beginning to be felt throughout all castesof French social life, and even those intelligent leaders whom one might expect to retain their freedom of speech are now fearful of saying anything which mightbe reported to Vichy or to the Germans.The studied policy of the Marshal as it affects the daily life of the Frenchcitizen to-day is one of blind obedience and &quot; follow me.&quot; French officialdom inthe civil and military organisations have recently had to tcike oaths not to the^tate, but directly and personally to the Marshal. Many observers think that theMarshal is honestly doing what he considers best for France, but the effects of[23754] B 2
his policy of blind obedience and servility are to stifle criticism and kill initiative and to make everyone afraid of his own shadow throughout the French dominions.In ruthlessly stifling those little incidents bound to arise among a free people whoare under the rule of a foreign army, France is creating a new class of tyrannicalpetty officialdom whose constant spyings and denunciations are rapidly changing the French character.French prisoners of war who have recently been released from German prisoncamps have told me that the atmosphere they found in North Africa was oneof oppression and fear; that in the prison camps they had one enemy theGermans but now that they were free they found that their enemies were inmany cases their own people.Possibly due to German pressure, the Vichy and North African newspapershave carried on in recent months a campaign of hate against Russia and a Frenchdivision of volunteers was enrolled to fight with the Germans against Russia. Itis curious to note that, in the contract of service, these Frenchmen are given theFrench uniform to wear while in France on leave, but they wear the Germanuniform while in the Reich or fighting. Men will be found in all countries who can be bought to serve any flag or any nation, but it is extremely difficult to see how even German pressure could have forced the French Government to permitlaudatory articles of these French volunteers to appear in the French newspapers.The French newspapers throughout unoccupied France and North Africahave no will of their own. Practically all their articles are barren copies ofarticles and editorials published or written under German supervision in Vichy.The tone of these articles is therefore one which it is hard to believe a trueFrenchman can stomach, but the Frenchman has no other source of news sinceimmediately after the Armistice, the radio being repetition of the press service.Editors of local papers have little or no choice concerning the articles theypublish and it has been reported that their daily wired press despatches fromVichy even carry a system of numbering and identifications which indicate whatprominence will be given each article. They are, however, permitted to publishin full and without comment English and American official war bulletins, along with the German and Italian. The more collaborationist newspapers do not publish the Allied bulletins unless their news is bad (announcement of sinkings.&amp;c). The one bright spot in French news coverage over the past few months isthe way General Mac Arthur&apos;s defence of the Philippines has completely conqueredthe French imagination and, German pressure notwithstanding, nearly all of theFrench papers have published every scrap of news available on his gallant fight,and he and his men are a symbol of determined resolution to the defeated French.Frenchmen returning from Paris or the occupied zone say that the air thereis a fresh one for Frenchmen to breathe; that the Germans are masters there aseveryone knows, but that no one except the Germans tries to deny to Frenchmentheir personal right of expressing in private their bitterest feelings against theGermans. These same French residents now find the political atmosphere ofunoccupied France and North Africa stifling. I have had two French friendsrecently leave Morocco to return to occupied France because they said it was theonly place where the atmosphere was clean, that another month subjected to the pressure of spying by their own Government and by French friends in north africa would deprive them of their reason. I had another French friend bid megoodbye last week when he sailed for South America saying he never wished toset foot in France again, that the France of his ancestors was dead and he wasleaving for ever.The tendency is growing daily throughout French North Africa to look over one&apos;s shoulder before speaking. The slightest remarks on political subjects aremade in hushed voices; the atmosphere of conspiracy and intrigue and feargrows daily. French friends have told me that they do not feel safe in even theirown houses, because their best friends or even their children might betrapped into denouncing them for making statements which might be termedas prejudicial to the State. This system of denouncing started with the legislationagainst the Jews and many narrow-minded French people rid themselves of pettyenemies and repaid business jealousies by making secret denunciations. TheLegion des Anciens Coinbattants has been given an especially unsavouryreputation in connection with these denunciations. Among a conquered peoplethis system of denunciation, having once been officially started, apparently growsout of all sense of proportion.   The things in Morocco Avhich are considered
prejudicial to the Government of France are incredible among a liberty-lovingpeople.After the defeat of France it is surely understandable that any Frenchmanwould hate the Germans, but no Frenchman to-day would attempt to say in apublic place in Casablanca or Rabat that he loathes the Germans. It is no wonderthat Frenchmen have gone back to occupied France saying it was the only placein which Frenchmen could breathe. Under the German occupation authorities the Frenchman has more right to his opinions and feelings than he has under hisown Government. What else can be expected from a Government which declareda national day of mourning for the accidental victims of the British bombardmentof Paris munitions factories engaged in war production for the Germans, butallowed its citizens no public demonstration or expression of sorrow on theoccasion of the ruthless execution by the Germans, without trial, of innocentFrench hostages.Wm. C. 3ENTLEY, Lt.-CoL, G.S.C. (A.C.).Military A attache, Tangier, Morocco.
