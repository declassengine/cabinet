(42)   208.May 15, 1942.WAR CABINET.BRITISH PUBLICITY IN THE UNITED STATES.Note by the Minister of Information. wI circulate herewith for the consideration of the War Cabinet a paper byMr. H. B. Butler, the new Director-General of the British Information services in the United States and Minister designate at Washington.B. B..THE NEED FOR AMERICAN UNDERSTANDING OF THEBRITISH WAR ACHIEVEMENT.(Memorandum by Mr. Harold Butler.)THE future political relations between Britain and the United Stateslargely depend upon the extent to which Americans can be brought to understand the nature and magnitude of the British war effort. If they regard our contribu-tion to victory as having been secondary, and second rate, they will consider our views on the peace settlement as of secondary importance. After the last war,as I learnt by personal experience in 1919, the average American had noconception of what we had done. If this happens again, the political consequenceswill be much more serious.During 1940 British prestige stood very high in America. In the last twelve months it has greatly declined. The Battle of Britain is forgotten. Withthe cessation of bombing the admiration for British fortitude gradually waned,the more so as the bombing of civilians became a commonplace elsewhere(Chungking, Singapore, Manila, &amp;c). The Battle of the Atlantic has remainedshrouded in mystery. To the ordinary American its existence can hardly berealised, so say nothing of its vital importance. In any case, the american people is for the most part not sea-conscious. The second Libya Campaign wasonly a partial success, while Hong Kong, Singapore and Burma have been signalfailures On the production side the American has been taught that the UnitedStates is the arsenal of democracy. He does not know that until now britain has, in fact, been the main arsenal. Still less does he know what an effort in planning, building, adaptation of plant and man-power is represented by thefact that our total war output is equal to that of the United States or that forthe years 1940 and 1941 we produced 50 per cent, more military aircraft thanthe United States.For his failure to comprehend the magnitude of our national effort theordinary American can hardly be blamed because the ordinary Englishman is hardly better informed. They have never been given the facts in an intelligibleform. Unless facts are given more plainly now, the political consequences of theunderestimation of Britain&apos;s part in the war may be serious in America. They[23822]
are not altogether negligible at home. The security factor ought to be recon-siclered in the light of the political factor with a view to striking a better balance between them.Some of the principal points which this reconsideration might cover maybe briefly suggested.I. Navy.The part played by the Navy is certainly not understood by the United States.If the bulk of the fighting in the Pacific is done by the American Navy, whereas the British Navjr is only heard of in connection with convoy actions in theMediterranean, the Atlantic and the North Sea, the American public will draw the conclusion that the brunt of the war at sea has fallen on the United Statesfleet. If it is considered essential to maintain complete secrecy as to present naval dispositions, the number of men in the Navy and the Mercantile marine, and thenumber of casualties at sea, some account might at least be given of past operations and their importance in thwarting an Axis victory. Among them might be suggested : (1) The strategical decision in 1940 to maintain our naval position in theMediterranean and to reinforce the Army of the Nile in spite of thefall of France and the exiguity of our naval and military resources.This was one of the boldest and most critical decisions of the war.Events have proved it to be one of the soundest and most far-sighted.Its better appreciation would greatly strengthen confidence in ourstrategical planning at a time when it is being subjected to muchill-informed criticism.(2) Malta. The strategical importance of Malta is not sufficiently realised,nor the immense difficulties of its defence. It has recently receiveda good deal of attention, but too much cannot be done in this direction.(3) Mediterranean. The naval situation is not the same as it was a yearago. Some connected account of the successful struggle of AdmiralsCunningham and Somerville against considerable odds, say, from june 1940 to June 1941 would do a great deal to stimulate the Britishand American publics and to make them realise the immense difficultyof the Navy&apos;s task. Most of the facts must be perfectly well knownto the enemy.II. Army.The work of the Army requires even more explanation than that of the Navy.The American, like the British, public does not understand either its actualachievements or the great difficulty of recruiting, equipping, training andtransporting a large army expanded from a very small nucleus. Such an understanding is all the more necessary as the United States is grappling withthe problem which we have had to solve.The following suggestions may be made : (1) Reviews of the Malayan and Burmese campaigns (disparity of numbers in men and aircraft, endurance and gallantry of troops and casualtiesinflicted, &amp;c).(2) Dominant importance of British Isles to the Allied cause what theirloss would mean in industrial production, naval and air bases, com-munications with Russia, springboard for invasion of Europe, &amp;c.(3) More evidence from enemy sources of the Army&apos;s efficiency, gallantry andequipment.(3) More evidence of its democratic character and modernity of its training.III. Royal A ir Force.Much less requires to be done to make the work of the R.A.F. understood.On the whole, it has had excellent publicity. More insistence should be given tothe fact that most of our fighting machines are British and less to the fact thatsome of them are American.At the same time it is also very desirable that Americans should realise theactual size of the RA.F. as a fighting force. Any comparison that could be given as to its numbers, either in men or machines, with the American and German
Air Forces would be helpful, as showing that even if we were unable to raise anarmy equal in size to the German or the American armies, we were playing our full part in the air.IV. Production..On this head there is a grave misconception of our effort. By featuringstrikes, stories of bad management, absenteeism, &amp;c, the newspapers have created a totally false impression of the spirit and the magnitude of our industrial effort.The only sure method of killing it is by figures not percentages and it is here that the conflict between political and security considerations becomes most acute.It may be noticed that in the last war a great deal of information was given.For instance, the report of the War Cabinet for 1917 (published in 1918)contains : (i) Number of persons employed in war industries,(ii) Steel output in tons.(iii) Number of tractors purchased.(iv) Annual output of merchant ships.(v) Number of wagons, locomotives, rails and sleepers sent abroad formilitary purposes.  Number of railwaymen in armed forces,(vi) Annual output and consumption of coal,(vii) Consumption of petrol for private purposes,(viii) Production of home-grown timber,(ix) Acreage under crops and annual production.It may not be expedient to give all or any of these figures now. circumstances are not altogether the same, but the importance of giving some clearer indication of what we have actually achieved can hardly be over-emphasised. The Germans,and to a much lesser extent the Americans, have acquired a reputation of industrial efficiency by their rapid transition from civil to military production in time ofpeace. Britain has had little or no credit for having achieved a more rapid and radical transformation than either while actually at war. The whole of ourvast expansion of production, with the enormous number of new factories and buildings which it has entailed, many of which have been built underground, hasbeen carried out in spite of the fact that the whole country was subjected to an intensive aerial bombardment at a critical time. Americans, on the other hand,can plan their industrial expansion without much regard for the dangers andconsequences of air attack. It is essential that Americans should understand what we have accomplished. They can only be convinced by graphs and statistics,for which they have a passion.Lord Halifax told the Americans that in the two years 1940-1941 Britainproduced nearly twice the number of military aircraft that were produced inthe whole of the United States. These figures require further development fortheir full significance to sink in. It is important that this should be done beforeAmerican production begins to exceed our own substantially.V. M awpower.On this subject little has been said. It is important to make Americansrealise that the British people has been more completely mobilised and is, there-fore, subjected to a much greater strain than they are ever likely to be. In 1918the 1917 figures for the three services and for munitions workers were published.The figures for June 1940 and June 1941 would be very helpful now. It may be doubted whether they would disclose anything not substantially known to theenemy. They would certainly reveal something of the scale of our national effort.At a time when we are supposed by critics at home and in the United States tobe &quot; half asleep,&quot; &quot; not going all out,&quot; &quot; only half mobilised,&quot; the moral valueof a crushing demonstration to the contrary may very possibly outweigh theadditional information which the enemy is likely to acquire. At this stage ofthe war nothing is more necessary than to make people here realise that thenational organisation and the national response to every call for sacrifice havebeen on a very high level, and to make Americans realise that we are not onlypulling our full weight now, but have been pulling it for some time past. Evenif actual figures for the various services cannot be given, the vast effort of recruit-ment, registration, placing, &amp;c, performed by the Employment Exchanges could
be statistically demonstrated without disclosing the numbers employed in anyparticular service, or even the total numbers actually engaged in the armed forces,or in production.VI.- Economic Organisation.The whole economic mobilisation of the country for war is perhaps one ofthe most successful of our undertakings. The maintenance of economic stabilitythrough heavy taxation, voluntary lending, restriction of purchasing possibilitiesthrough rationing of clothing, and the reduction of civil production, the com-paratively small increase in wage rates and the consequent comparative stability of prices, all represent a remarkable achievement which is not sufficiently under-stood either here or abroad. As the United States is now confronted with the sameproblem, and is likely to find even greater difficulty in solving it, some publicityof the whole economic effort, particularly among instructed people and periodicalsin the United States, would be of great value. As far as I know, no attempt has yet been made to paint a comprehensive picture.Other instances could be given of topics requiring some more publicity. Theobject of this memorandum is to suggest that more may be lost by allowing theBritish achievement to be decried and belittled both here and in America thanin preserving a secrecy which is to some extent illusory. Though the germans have said little, we have a pretty good idea of what they have done. Theirignorance is not likely to be greater than ours. Against withholding some facts,which are at least partially known, has to be weighed the considerable politicaldanger in allowing our &quot; case &quot; to go by default.H. B. B.May 15, 1942.
