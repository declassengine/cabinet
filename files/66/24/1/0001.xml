The Chiefs of Staff point out that while we are ina relatively satisfactory position to conduct chemical warfare onthe European front, the reverse is the case in the Middle Eastand Indian Ocean theatres.    Moreover, they consider that whilegas might he a&apos;&apos;useful defensive weapon to us in the event of invasion of this country, we should he placed at a serious disadvantage If the enemy had the initiative to use gas against us during the - early stages of an assault on the Continents3* &apos; The crux of the matter is the situation in India and, toa lesser extent, in Egypt,    Between now and the &quot;beginning of Mayit would be impossible to give the vast mass of the Indianpopulation even the most elementary protection against gas attack,if the Japanese were to use this weapon against them.    an instruction to the Government of India and to the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East and India to organise anti-gas precautionsat the present moment would, therefore, only have a depressing effect, since they could not carry out such an instruction   in thenear future with the resources at their disposal.)\m The Defence Committee realise that we cannot withdraw from the undertaking given to Premier Stalin to retaliate on theGermans if they use gas against the Russians.5, The altered circumstances which have arisen due to the rapid Japanese advance to the Westward and the exposure of India toattack, seem, however, to justify a review of the exact timing ofthe public announcement, at present arranged for the beginning ofMaye6, The Defence Committee suggest that the point might be put to Premier Stalin and that, as a first step, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs might consult Ma Maisky as to the best methodof approach *(Intld.)

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government most SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.ANNEX 1.REPORT.IN view of the public announcement which may shortly be made to the effectthat if the Germans use gas against the Russians we shall retaliate, we have thought it right to review our preparedness for chemical warfare.&quot;2. Annex 2 is a summary of a more detailed technical report of the stateof our own and of enemy preparations.3. Annex 3 contains a commentary on the technical report from the operational point of view.4. The important point which emerges from the above studies is that, exceptin the Home theatre, we are virtually unprepared for gas warfare. Thisunpreparedness applies equally to civil as well as to service measures.5. As it would take a long time to build up our defensive and offensiveC.W. equipment in the Middle and Far East to the same level as it is in theHome theatre, it is essential that Governments and Commanders-in-Chiefconcerned should be warned of the impending announcement and instructed totake such precautionary measures as will provide some form of elementaryprotection and education within the next few months.6. Finally, we draw attention to the fact that the Russians may be tempted to accuse the Germans of having used gas against them, without their havingdone so, in order to bring our counter-measures into play. We shall have no checkwhether the story is true or false. If it is in any way possible our public statement should guard against this contingency.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.DUDLEY POUND.C. F. A.

[C.O.S. (42) 81 (O).]ANNEX 2.REVIEW.Summary.A. The Use of Gas in the European Theatre.Our State of Preparedness for Offensive Gas Operations from the A ir.1.   The use of gas from the air is likely to be the primary form of ChemicalV/Warfare in the European Theatre of War. We are in a sound position to carryAppendix A, out effective air operations, both with gas bombs and with spray. Preparationspara. 1. have been made whereby we can undertake a sustained offensive with mustardand phosgene up to 20 per cent, of our available bomber effort.   A much higher rate would be possible during a peak period if this were necessary.2. Reserve stocks of gas bombs and spray are sufficient to last until produc-tion can be expanded to a scale sufficient to sustain gas bombing and spraying at appendix A,   25 per cent, effort, for a period certainly beyond the end of 1943.  Stocks of bombspara. 1 (iii). ana&quot; spray containers are kept at operational bomber stations and maintenanceunits within easy reach of the stations.   No more warning is necessary for gasAppendix A,   bombing than is necessary for H.E. bombing.   Two to four hours warning ispara,. 5. necessary for the use of gas spraying.The Enemy&apos;s State of Preparedness for Offensive Gas Operations from the Air.Appendix B, 3.   Enemy stocks of gas are ample and it is probable that they will be ableparas. 1 and 6. -to use this weapon at very short notice.   There is evidence that he has made a careful study of chemical warfare and that he is prepared to use it in largeAppendix B, . quantities as a surprise weapon.   Available evidence indicates that the Germansparas. 3 and 7, ihave no special fear of retaliation which might prevent them from using gas ifthis appeared to be to their advantage.   This fear of retaliation is expected to be greater in Italy owing to the low standard of organisation in that country, butthis effect is likely to be off-set by the limited bombing we can launch against&apos; Italy owing to our shortage of aerodromes within easy reach of the country.Appendix C,para. 7.Appendix C,para. 4.    our Use of Gas on the Ground.4. Our troops are not able effectively to retaliate with gas at present owingto lack of equipment As far as the western front is concerned we have not atpresent any ground contact with the Germans, and therefore available stocks of chemical warfare weapons will be reserved for use in case of invasion.Full-scale chemical warfare troops are available and these are fairly welltrained, but there is a grave shortage in the supply of weapons, particularly of artillery chemical warfare shell, which are well below the target figures. Thisis largely due to shortage of fuses.The Enemy&apos;s use of Gas on the Ground.Appendix E, 5.   The enemy are believed to be well trained and equipped with a largepara. 3. variety of ground weapons for use with gas.  These include mortars, rockets, the infantry gun and Artillery proper. They attach importance to using gas onlyin large quantities and in favourable conditions and to obtaining surprise.s&apos;ku?t.\-\t:   Our Defensive Measures.Appendix1 I), 6.   Personnel are fully equipped, but the reproofing of A.V. clothing! ispara. 3,. presenting administrative difficulties.   All personnel, including, civilians^ areequipped with respirators which give complete protection against all forms ofknown gas.   Stocks of reserve clothing are adequate.The civilian population is as well trained as can be expected, and decon-decontamination , &amp;c, services are satisfactory.i r; No general detector is yet available for the possible new odourless fillingmentioned in C.O.S.

The Enemy&apos;s Defensive Measures.7.   German anti-gas training is thorough, and the equipment is compre- Appendix E,f\hensive if slightly cumbrous.   Its full use would limit mobility and firc-power Para- 6-of his forces.It is probable that civilians in all big towns have respirators, though these Appendix E,are not a free issue.   Recent reports indicate that special measures have been Para- 6-taken in this direction.   There will possibly be some difficulty in replacingreserve clothing if chemical warfare is extensive.Conclusions on the Use of Gas Warfare in the European Theatre.8. We are well able to carry on chemical warfare in Europe by air action,but the Army is not yet equipped with adequate weapons and it will be several months before it is so equipped.B. The Use of Gas in Overseas Theatres.Gas Offensive by our A ir Forces.9. We are in a fairly satisfactory position to undertake a gas air offensive in the Middle East, except that the bombs at present forming the majority of stocks are not as efficient as the new 65-lb. bomb now being produced. The lattertype of bomb cannot be sent out charged, and, therefore, extra shipping spaceis necessary to carry filling to charge the empty bomb on the spot.A factory for the production of mustard is being started in South Africa,and the intention is to use this for supplying overseas theatres.No stocks of aircraft chemical warfare weapons are available in other theatres, although a number of weapons are en route to India. considerable quantities of these weapons were lost in Malaya, and we are not yet able to wagechemical warfare from the air in any theatre abroad except the Middle East.Appendix A,para. 6.Appendix A,para. 6.Appendix A,paras. 7 and 8.Gas Offensive by Enemy Air Forces.10.   There are indications that the Germans and Italians are omitting no Appendix B,necessary measures for putting chemical warfare into operation, but there is no Para- 4-indication of any immediate intention of using this weapon.Japanese facilities and intentions are not known, but it must be assumed Appendix B,that they have taken adequate steps in preparation to wage chemical warfare paras 9when it suits them to do so. - and 10-Our Use of Gas on the Ground.11. Our lack of equipment abroad is worse than at home. Only 25 per cent,of planned stocks of gas shells are available in the Middle East, and these arethe only chemical warfare ground weapons in this theatre. There are none atpresent in other theatres, though there are stocks of 25-pdr. shells en route forthe Middle East and India. Three months&apos; estimated supply of 5-inch rocketsand a number of 4-2-inch mortar bombs will accompany the chemical warfaregroup sailing for India in April.Appendix C,paras. 10-12.Appendix C,para. 11.Enemy&apos;s Use of Gas on the Ground.12.

On the other hand if gas warfare were initiated the strategicaladvantages which Japan now enjoys virtually gives her civilian populationimmunity.Conclusions on the Use of Gas Warfare in Overseas Theatres.15.   Apart from an air offensive in the Middle East we are not in a positionto wage chemical warfare in any overseas theatre.C. General Conclusions embracing all Theatres.16. Although we are in a position to wage chemical warfare effectively by our air forces against the enemy in Germany and in the Middle East, the army is not yet adequately equipped with chemical weapons in any theatre.There is no likelihood that once started, chemical warfare will be limitedto those theatres where we can effectively retaliate.If the initiation of gas warfare led to its use in certain Eastern Theatres,the almost complete lack of protection of the civilian population would be likelyto involve us in the gravest difficulties, especially in India.We consider that it would be to our grave disadvantage if we became involvedin chemical warfare in the immediate future.APPENDIX A.Own Air Preparations.Europe.Gas Bombing.1. It is considered that the gas bomb is the primary C.W. weapon. We are capable of carrying out sustained gas bombing operations with bombs filledmustard and phosgene up to 20 per cent, of our total assessed bombing effort.The 65-lb. L.C. bomb has been adopted as the standard gas weapon on accountof its wider tactical employment and the simplicity of manufacture : (i) Stocks of filled gas bombs in the United Kingdom are as follows, basedon the policy of holding 15 per cent, of our available effort in H.T.and 6 per cent, in C.G. :  Quantity.65-lb. L.C. bombs-Filled H.T.      ... 100,000Empty    ...... 10,000250-lb. L.C. bombs-Filled H.T.       ... 20,000Empty    ...      ... Nil30-lb. L.C. bombs-Filled H.T.      ... 158,000Empty    ...... 100,0002504b.

25 per cent, of these bombs are held at operational BomberStations and the remainder is readily accessible at nearby Main-tenance Units and Reserve Depots. 250-lb. bombs, filled C.G., are heldonly in Central storage.(ii) 7 Medium and 3 Heavy Bomber Squadrons have been detailed tospecialize in bombing with the 65-lb. bomb, but this does not precludebombing being carried out by all other bombing aircraft.(iii) Reserve stocks of bombs and gas and gas capacity are sufficient to carryover until production can be expanded to a scale sufficient to sustaingas bombing operations at the present approved percentage of effortalmost indefinitely, certainly beyond the end of 1943.Spray.2. 5 Medium and 5 Light Bomber Squadrons are at present - available and trained in gas spray. Their spray equipment, which consists of 1,000-lb.and 500-lb. S.C.Is., are distributed between Operational Stations or MaintenanceUnits or Depots. The following stocks are available based on the policy of holding 5 per cent, of the available effort of heavy and medium bombers arid10 per cent, of light bombers for the 1,000-lb. and 500-lb. S.C.I. respectively : Quantity. Remarks.Heavy and Medium bombers 1,000-ib. S.C.I.      ...      2,900       10 months&apos;reserve at the above scale of effort.Light Bombers 500-lb. S.C.I.      ...      4,500       18 months&apos;reserve at the above scale of effort.Production of S.C.Is. has ceased, but stocks are estimated to be sufficient forsustained operations until S.C.Is. can again be put into production, filled and made available in the required numbers.Production of Gas Bombs.3. 250-lb. L.C. and 30-ib. L.C. bombs are already in fairly large-scale production for incendiary purposes; no difficulty will be encountered in switchingthese bombs to gas filling should the occasion demand. In this respect they forma valuable potential reserve for operations requiring penetration and accurateaiming.(i) Present production of filled and empty gas bombs in  the UnitedKingdom is as follows :  For U.K.       For Overseas,per week. per week.&quot; (a) 65-lb. L.C. bomb, filled H.T....... 5,000 1,00065-lb. L.C. bomb, empty   ......... 6,500 1,000(6) 250-lb. L.C. bomb, empty ...       ...       ... 750 per week to retain capacity for 2,500 per week.250-lb. and 30-lb. L.C. bombs, filled H.T.... Nil.(ii) The filling for the Royal Air Force of the 250-lb. L.C. bomb withphosgene has ceased. Production of phosgene for the Royal AirForce has also ceased, but capacity exists adequate to cover UnitedKingdom and overseas requirements until the end of 1943. This gasis not likely to be used in large quantities after the initial onslaught.(iii) S.C.1. production has also ceased, but can be recommenced in time tosupply the needs for sustained operations.Initial Gas Effort.. .4. The initial gas effort will probably call for a heavy proportion of gasbombs to H.E., particularly filled C.G., but it is considered unlikely that a tacticalsituation will develop which will necessitate anything like the total lift of all aircraft being diverted to gas bombing.On an average, it is estimated that approximately 25 per cent, of the totallift will be devoted to gas bombs and spray once offensive gas warfare begins.[23722]c
State of Readiness..5. No more warning is necessary to initiate gas bombing than is at presentnecessary for H.E. bombing. For spray, 4 hours&apos; Avarning is necessary in the caseof the Wellingtons and 2 hours in the case of the light bombers to prepare these aircraft for their gas-spraying roles.Middle East.6. Similar preparations to those made in the United Kingdom have beenmade for the Middle East to cover offensive gas warfare operations. Stocks of bombs and S.C.Is. already held in tihe Middle East are as follows :  All bombers-250-lb. L.C. bombs, filled H.T.30-lb. L.C. bombs, filled H.T.Light bombers-500-lb. S.C.I ......250-lb. S.C.I.All bombers 65-lb. L.C. bomb.8,000 Tactical reserve.17,000 Tactical reserve.1,650 6 months at 10 per cent.700 Tactical reserve.8,750 1 month at 15 per cent.Bombs and S.C.Is. at the present moment in transit are as follows :  *A11 bombers 250-lb. L.C. bomb, charged C.G.    ...     3,000 4-j months at 6 per cent.65-lb. L.C. bomb, filled H.T.        ...     3,400 3 weeks at 15 per cent.65-lb. L.C. bomb, empty    ......     7,000.There are at present no alternative sources of supply of C.W. weapons for theMiddle East other than by shipment from the United Kingdom, althougharrangements are being made to produce gas weapons in South Africa. It isexpected that 25 tons per week of mustard could be reached in South Africaduring the next few months. This would cover overseas needs other than middle east for charging 65-lb. L.C. bombs until the end of 1942.India and Burma.7. The C.W. weapon policy is still under discussion, but certain shipments of bombs and S.C.Is. have been authorised in anticipation of the Indian Govern -ment&apos;s acceptance of our suggestions. Neither gas bombs nor S.C.I. exist in thatcountry.Australia and New Zealand.8. The supply of C.W. weapons to Australia is under discussion. No stocks are held in either Dominion.Passive A ir Defence.Personal Equipment and State of Training.9. All personnel are issued with respirators, personal anti-gas clothing,ointment and eye-shields at recruit centres and training in the use of this equip-ment commences immediately.Throughout their training further instruction is given and station gaspractices, held periodically, complete their training.Training in all overseas Commands in the Middle East is based on that athome and each Command has a highly trained chemical adviser.A scientific officer and gas n.c.os. have recently been sent from Middle East toIndia to assist in training and in care and maintenance of weapons.Impregnated cloth]ng is held at operational stations for immediate issue to air crews and flight personnel. Reserves are held at all units according to an authorised scale.Warning System.10.   Considered satisfactory.Decontamination.11. Adequate cleansing arrangements and personnel are available at allstations. Decontamination squads for cleansing aircraft, buildings, &amp;c, are fullytrained and equipped.Reserve Clothing.12. Stock position is satisfactory at home. The position abroad should be reasonably satisfactory, as all personnel proceed with their personal issue andthe Air Ministry meet all overseas demands.
No information is available regarding the position in India, as, until recently, personnel proceeded without their reserve clothing, but it is probablethat some large consignments intended for the Far East have been diverted toC&apos;ndia. .APPENDIX B.Enemy Air Preparations.Germany.1. THE Germans have large stocks of all the more important chemical warfare agents, and their Air Force could be ready to use gas weapons quite as quickly as the Royal Air Force. There is every indication that their techniqueand technical development in the use of gas from the air has advanced on similar lines to those of the Royal Air Force, and that a similar standard of efficiencycould be expected.2. Reports indicate that the Germans continue to make unremitting searchesfor new chemical warfare materials and methods of applying them and theirfactory facilities are large.3. The Germans have taken measures to protect their civilian and servicepopulations, and so there is no reason to believe that they would have any fear of gas retaliation by us. The fear of such retaliation is not, therefore, likely toprevent them from using gas if it is likely to be to their advantage.   &apos;. 4. A captured Italian document circulated to Italian units contained a questionnaire supplied by the German Militant Attache to the Italian GeneralStaff. This document contained a long list of enquiries asking for information concerning the suitability of the North African climate in relation to the useof gases. It indicated that every precaution was being taken and that all measures for putting chemical warfare into use were receiving attention.5. It is probable that the Germans will not hesitate to use chemical warfarewhen it suits them to do so, and in that case they will apply the maximumelement of surprise.Italy.6. The Italians appear to have ample stocks and facilities for all essentialchemical warfare agents, and continual research in new chemicals and themethod of their employment is proceeding in Italy.7. Fear of retaliation against the civil population may be greater than thatof Germany or Great Britain, as the organisation of home defence in this directiondoes not appear to be of the same high standard. However, for geographicalreasons many parts of Italy are less liable to air attack from our existingaerodromes.8. There is no indication that the Italians have any immediate intentionof using chemical warfare, but they could probably do so immediately if forced into it by their German allies, or in retaliation.Japan.; 9. With the information available it is only possible to conclude that theJapanese are aware of all the main methods of the use of gas from the air, butit is not known to what extent they are equipped for its immediate use. Thename of a Japanese factory said to be producing the latest types of poison gasesand arsenic derivatives is known, and it is certain that there must be others.10. Judging by the chemical warfare equipment of the Japanese militaryforces it must be assumed that the technique of using gases from the air in theform of bombs or spray is well understood by them, and it is probable that theyhave made arrangements for its use if necessary.
APPENDIX C.Own Ground Offensive.Position at Home.State of Training.1. There is an establishment for a staff officer. trained in chemical warfarein all headquarters down to divisions. Since the rate of change is high, a certainnumber of these are not fully trained. Their duties are not confined to thissubject.At Corps and above, Technical Officers (Chemical Warfare) are established;these have an excellent knowledge of the technique of Chemical Warfare and aregaining in military experience.Chemical warfare troops are fully organised and trained to use their presentequipment, and have received initial training with their new equipment.There is some doubt as to the best method of their control by formation staffsin war which can only be resolved by experience. Since this is an untried weapon,issues of which have but lately been made and of which full technical details are not yet available, the best results cannot be expected at first.Weapons.Charged shell with fuzes.2. 25-pdr: The War Office requirement, 75 per cent, mustard gas, 25 percent, tear gas, is 1,050,000. This figure was based on a daily expenditure of3^ rounds per gun for 30 days in Europe, and half the daily rate for 90 days in Eastern theatres, and represented a 2-g months&apos; reserve.The target figure for the several theatres of war. including reserves, to beheld overseas is 646,900.The present position : Stated War Office requirement is ... ...       ... 1,050,000Target, for deliveries to all theatres ...       ... 646,900Stocks delivered to all theatres    ... 218,500 1In   transit   overseas   or   awaiting                     ^ 350.000shipment ......... 131,500 !There is roughly 3 weeks5 supply at standard rate actually ready in british isles and Northern Ireland, and the same in the Middle East; there is no supply as yet in India or Cepof Reserve.The enclosure gives full details, and shows that the Middle East situation will improve rapidly as shipments arrive.3. %-inch How.

Theenclosure gives details.The above represents our ability to retaliate immediately with Chemical shell.4. Charged Shell. There is a large number of charged shell for whichfuzes are not ready.The figures below give the stated War Office requirement and the number ofcharged shell that have actually passed inspection; they include tb &quot;)se in1 above- PassedRequirement.

There is serious lag in fuze production. Figures given below refer solely to fuzes for chemical shell. Only about 400,000 have been issued, and during theiast four weeks only 7,000 have been received.One cause of the lag has been removed by a relaxation of proof, another isthe time required for the soldering of containers for fuzes which are to be heldin store or sent abroad. If chemical warfare started now, a proportion of theuncased fuzes could be issued for immediate use.Future position. There are over 200,000 fuzes in the fuze-filling factories.An output&quot; of about 75,000 a week is expected now and the forecast of futureproduction is about 100,000 a week, but it will be two months before the position with regard to the 221-fuze is satisfactory.Charging Capacity and Stocks of Gas.5. Of the total 25-pounder requirement of 1,050,000 300,000 is a reserve to cover the charging production lag.There is no charging production lag reserve for other calibres.There will be ample stocks of mustard gas to charge all shell coming forward.There is no stock of tear gas, largely owing to plant trouble, but it is expectedthat the 18 tons per week required will be coming out by the end of May.If charging ceases when the stated requirement is reached, the lag in reaching full production will be at least three months. The production lag reserveis one month, the 2^ months&apos; reserve being to cover stocks in transit.Thus, on the estimated expenditure reserves of charged shell will have been exhausted before production can keep pace. The Ministry of Supply is considering this position.Empty Shell Bodies.8. 25 Pdr. There are 150,000 empties, and the rate of production is60,000-70,000 a week. The target of empties in stock to cover production lagreserve is 1,650,000. This will be reached within a year. Until then, productioncovers maintenance rate.There are 50,000 emptj^ 6-inch bodies, 15,000 empty 5-5-inch. A total stock of 171,000 empties of each type is planned.The ballistics of B.E. chemical shell have been a source of concern.Experience has not yet been obtained as to their performance in 3rd and 4thquarter guns.Chemical Warfare Troops.7. There are 11 Chemical Warfare Groups each of 3 companies. At presentall except one group are armed with Livens Projectors. This group is preparedto go to India in early April, and is armed with 5-inch rockets in two companies and 4 - 2-inch mortars in one company.The others, of which one is in B.T.N.I., the remainder in England, will be similarly re-equipped when the production situation allows, probably by August.1942.8.   Weapons. The following stocks are held :  (a) Livens Drums charged mustard gas     ...       ...      60,000Livens Drums charged phosgene ...       ...       ...      40,000matched with propelling charges and ancillaries.This represents 8 full salvoes of mustard gas per company, and 5 of chokinggas. There is an uncharged reserve of 30,000, for which gas can be found. Inview of the re-equipment programme further production is not contemplatedJMonthly expenditure was originally estimated at 16,000 per month.Livens Barrels. There are 8,000 barrels in stock, apart from those withChemical Warfare troops. The estimated wastage rate is 1 barrel to every10 rounds fired. This is in addition to the wastage due to non-recovery afterfiring.[23722j d
(b) 5-inch Rockets.There are 95,000 bombs charged phosgene, and not less than 80,000 tails:There is a big surplus of fuzes.   Equipment for firing this weapon is in produc-Qtion, and it is hoped may be complete for 22 companies by the end of July 1942.Only four companies can be equipped by the end of April.132,000 a month is the anticipated expenditure. A charged reserve of160,000 and uncharged of 72,000 has been ordered. The present charging capacity is about 15,000 per week, and. the full rate of 132,000 a month cannot be reacheduntil more charging plant is built. This is in hand. The supply of phosgene is adequate.The production forecast for tails is 12,500 per week, about 10,000 are actuallybeing made.The full production rate of 132,000 complete rounds might be reached in threemonths after chemical warfare starts.Although the dispersion of the rockets now being supplied is greater than was hoped for, it has been agreed to accept them for the present. The designdepartment has been informed of the greater accuracy required and small lots(10 per cent, of the total) from one manufacturer meet this demand. the required production rate cannot be met by this one firm nor can these accurate tailsbe made by the other firms if production is to be maintained.All rockets delivered are dharged phosgene. The decision to implement theoriginal order to charge 25 per cent, mustard gas has been delayed on unpromisingresults of early trials. A full-scale trial is to be fired within the next few days onthe results of which a decision whether to charge with mustard gas will be taken.(c) 4-2-inch mortars.250 mortars have been ordered, and 750,000 empty bombs, 250,000 of whichare to be charged in the ratio 50 pei cent, mustard gas, phosgene 20 per cent, smoke,5 per cent. H.E. for ranging.About 90 mortars have been delivered and training is in progress. Allmortars are expected by mid-April. As yet no charged bombs have been delivered.10,000 charged mustard gals are promised by the 12th April; 1,000 charged H.E.by that date, or shortly afterwards. It is hoped to produce 20,000 charged mustardgas in April, 25,000 in May, 45,000 in June, and to reach the full monthly pro-duction of 60,000 in July. If this were done, it would take the full stocks of emptybodies which will exist by that time.No charging with phosgene for two months is to be expected, and it can thenbe done only at the expense of rockets.The design for the smoke bomb is now clear.The allocation of the remaining 500,000 bombs between different chargingsis not yet decided.Ground Contamination Weapons.9..   Charged stocks are Chemical Mines, 13,300.Ground bombs (6-lb.), 132,000.Bulk contamination vehicles, 105, with 76 refills.20,000 empty mines, 900,000 empty bombs, and 238 empty installations for.C.Vs. are held. Monthly wastage rates are estimated to be 5,000, 50,000 and15 respectively. The requirement of gas for 120 refills a month for B.C.V.S canbe met.Position A broad.10.   Middle East.

APPENDIX D.Own Ground Defensive.- At Home.1. All troops at Home are equipped to full scale in all personal equipmentexcept that the issue of one suit of A.V. battle dress per man to all troops is not complete. reserves to full scale are held. All suits now being issued to troops at home are A.V.   The issue of Unit equipment is also satisfactory.2. The state of training, while necessarily variable, is generally reported&apos;as reasonably good. Instructors have been trained at the Army Gas School forall Units and more are being trained at a rate sufficient to meet present wastage.There is a severe shortage of training stores, but the increasing use of real wargases is of value in training. Once the initial surprise is over, undue casualtiesdue to indifferent training are not anticipated.3. The protection given by all respirators is considered to be adequateagainst concentrations which their holders might meet. All military and civilianpersonnel have been issued with respirators.4. Our warning systems, both civil and military, meet essential require-&apos;meats. Improvements in the warning for large cloud attacks from the sea arein hand. The risk is not great, but the extra equipment will not be ready untilJuly 1942. It is impracticable to give prior warning of spray attacks. efforts are concentrated on instructions on how to avoid contamination and action to betaken if it does occur. Spray detector boards are hi use in town and country andare considered adequate to indicate when spray has fallen. These requireperiodic repainting. The Gas Identification Service is satisfactorily established and trained. The Decontamination Services are organised and equippedthroughout the country, and in consequence of trials with real mustard gastraining has recently been redirected on a more practical basis. The existing services for first aid and rescue work have had practical experience of air raidsand have also been trained in their work under conditions of Chemical Warfare;these services are considered satisfactory. Limited facilities have been providedfor cleansing the public who may be contaminated. Instruction is how especiallydirected towards making people cleanse themselves. Laundry services for decon-decontamination  of military and civil clothing are being established, the installationsare not complete and training has only commenced. Arrangements for poolingmilitary and civil resources for cleansing, decontamination and treatment ofcontaminated clothing have been made. Air raid shelters have been provided3for the public, but these are not gasproof. Important control centres are provided^ with gas-proof accommodation.5. Civil defence services have all necessary clothing arid equipment and adequate reserves in certain of the most recently organised services, notably publicgas- cleansing and: decontamination of civilian clothing, which have hot yet received full supply of reserve underclothing. It is expected that half the deficiencies will be met in one month and the balance within threei months.Abroad.Middle East.6. All troops are equipped to- full scale with personal and Unit protectiveclothing and equipment, with the exception of A.V. battle-dress, which is notissued further East than Malta.   Full scales of reserve are also available.Respirators are provided for the civilian population in the principal townsin Palestine and in Cyprus. Only British civilians in Egypt have respirators,i There are also adequate stocks of protective clothing and bleach for decontamina-tion purposes in Palestine.India and Burma.7: All&apos;troops are equipped to full scale with personal and Unit anti-gasequipment. In view of the facti that oilskin protective clothing has proved to be&apos; [23722] E
unsatisfactory under the temperature conditions in this theatre, a special typeof porous cape has been designed and is being produced locally.   Production has,however, only just started.India is also manufacturing respirators locally; at what rate is not known.,The only civilian respirators known to be in India are 500,000 recentlydespatched to Singapore and diverted after Singapore had fallen.It is likely that stocks of bleach for decontamination are available in India,but there is no definite information available to this effect.Australia and New Zealand.8. The equipment of troops to full scale with personal and Unit protectiveclothing and equipment is not complete, although all troops are in possession ofrespirators. A demand for oilskin clothing to complete their stocks to the authorised scale has recently been made on this country by Australia. Theystarted local production of civilian respirators in March 1942, the target being1 million. One million containers only have been despatched from this country.New Zealand has made 300,000 civilian respirators locally, but is awaitingdelivery of filter pads from this country.Other Places.9. The Oversea Defence Committee have recently considered the need for civilian anti-gas precautions in the Colonies, and their views are as follows :   -(a) In view of space required to store and transport gas, the risk of its being used in attacks by warships and seaborne aircraft is remote.(&amp;) The provision of respirators for the general civilian population incolonies exposed only to these forms of attack is unnecessary.(c) It is desirable, however, that respirators should be supplied to the keypersonnel of essential civilian services.A statement showing the present.state of anti-gas measures in the Coloniesfollows : (a) Colonies where respirators are provided for the entire civilian population.Malta (including service or civilian duty respirators for key personnel)..Gibraltar (including service or civilian duty respirators for key personnel).Aden (except for civilians who would not remain in Aden under attack.Many respirators have deteriorated, but the Governor has askedfor a further supply).^b) Colonies ivhere respirators are provided for the civilian population inprincipal towns.Cyprus (including service or civilian duty respirators for key personnel).Palestine (including service or civilian duty respirators for key personnel).(c) Colonies where respirators are provided for key personnel of civil defence services.Gambia (all key personnel provided for).Gold Coast (all key personnel provided for).Sierra Leone  (154 service respirators  for fire brigade,  first  aid,  &amp;c.71 civilian duty masks).Uganda (45 civilian duty respirators in stock).Zanzibar  (20  sets  of  equipment,  including  respirators,   in  stock  fordecontamination squads).St. Helena (equipment for police and civil defence wardens available on loan from garrison stores).Transjordan (service respirators provided for key personnel.  Other civiliansencouraged to buy respirators).Trinidad (20 serviceable respirators available primarily for use of police, and80 respirators provided by oil companies for refinery personnelliable to exposure to dangerous gases). .
APPENDIX E.Enemy Ground Preparations.Offensive Measures.Organisation.1. The outline organisation of German C.W. or SmOke Regiments isknown. Five have been identified in Russia and a sixth is known to exist. NoChemical Warfare Troops have yet been identified in Libya, though there is a&quot;&quot;smoke Kommando &quot; there. All the others are thought to be now on the southof the Russian frdht.Three decontamination units are known to exist. Just prior to the Russiancampaign all smoke units, in common with A.F.Vs. were given Priority I.Manufacture of Chemical Warfare Materials.2. There is little information on production, but none that it is falling inGermany. Italian production is probably small. In spite of her large chemicalmanufacturing potential, Axis output would be limited by her chlorine output.Even allowing for the occupied countries, chlorine available for the manufactureof poison gas is not likely to be largely in excess of that of Great Britain, andmust be inferior to Great Britain and United States combined. Potentialproduction is thus no incentive to Germany to initiate chemical warfare.(d) Colonies where no precautions have been taken [except to extent shown).Bahamas.Barbados.British Honduras.British Guiana (12 respirators for training purposes).Jamaica.Leeward Islands.Windward Islands.Bermuda (Joint Defence Committee has now recommended equipment of(a) key personnel, and (b) (later) all civilians. They have beeninformed that (a) can be provided, but (b) does not seem necessary).Northern Rhodesia.Nyasaland.Tanganyika (100 sets of equipment available for training, but somehavedeteriorated).Nigeria.Mauritius.Falkland Islands.Ceylon (very small quantities of equipment available for instruction purposes,but most of it is unserviceable).Fiji (Government has asked Australia and New Zealand what equipment canbe supplied).Western Pacific.Seychelles (Government considers provision of 10,000 respirators would suffice for Victoria). iN.B. The above does not take into account equipment issued by service departments to Service personnel.
Ground Gas Weapons.3.   The Germans have a large variety of gas ground weapons : (a) Chemical Warfare Troops have 10 cm. mortars with a long range and high rate of fire, and a salvo weapon, probably a rocket, which, onsuch information as we have, must be rated good. Eange of both isup to 6,000 metres and considerably in excess of our own counterparts.(b) Infantry. The infantry mortar, and the 7-5 Howitzer fire tear gas, the15 cm. infantry howitzer fires lethal gas.(c) Artillery. The Artillery proper can fire all types of gas.Chargings.4. The Germans have available a large number at least eight differentchargings, possibly more. They regard variation in chargings as an importantway of obtaining surprise. They may have chargings which they believe to besuperior to ours. Some recent intelligence and research has suggested one of thechargings is an odourless form of blister gas from which high vapour concentra-tions, very damaging certainly to the eyes and possibly to the lungs, are to beexpected. Some additional instructions and equipment may be required to meet this threat.Tactics.5. (a) In attack. It is notable that they possess at least six differentchargings which are used in projectiles with large high explosive charges. Theburst is violent enough to be mistaken for an HE. projectile. It is the Germanhope that their use of gases with little smell in such weapons will go unnoticeduntil casualties have been caused. Their tear gas and nose gas chargings areuseful for their immediate effect.Their salvo weapons should be of great value in preparing an attack onstrong points.Some of the chargings used in these weapons have also a slight blister effect.The Germans recognise that they might cause casualties to their own troops goingin to attack, but consider the risk worth taking. In short, they do not regard gassolely as a defensive weapon, but ai^e fully able to exploit its offensive value.They attach great importance to obtaining the maximum surprise, and to usinggas only in large quantities and in such favourable circumstances that a markedresult is highly probable.(b) In defence. The Germans believe strongly in the value of ground con-decontamination . They would certainly regard this use of gas by their enemy as aserious menace to the movement of their infantry. They have equipped andtrained themselves to meet this threat.Passive Defence.Germany.6. German Army anti-gas training is thorough and equipment comprehendsive if slightly cumbrous. Its full use would greatly limit their mobility and firepower. ... jIf their scale of equipment is representative of their appreciation of thetdanger of the Chemical Warfare arm, they must also consider their use of it would impose a great handicap on defending troops. -... It is known that they consider British anti-gas preparedness to.be sound andthorough.   Their opinion of Russian preparedness seems to be lower. , ,  ,Before the war the enemy paid great attention to civilian gas defence. Therehave been periodical reports of drives in enemy countries towards improving;,these measures, especially the building of gas-proof shelters and. completing theissue of respirators, in areas presumed most vulnerable. It is unlikely that;respirators, which are not a free issue in Germany, are held by all civilians,though it must be assumed that in all big towns all civilians are protected. There:have been recent reports of special measures in this direction. It must, beassumed that German defence is good.Issue of respirators in Italy is very limited, and it has lately been reportedthat Italian gas defence is very backward.
Italy.7. The Italians appear to possess gas detectors for liquid chemical agentssimilar to our own. All Italian Service personnel are equipped with respiratorsgiving adequate protection, although not of the same quality as the Britishrespirator. There is little evidence of the complete organisation for civiliandefence, but it is believed that respirators are issued free of charge only to thepopulation in the areas considered most liable to attack. At one time all othercivilians were expected to purchase their own respirators. Undoubtedly, if theItalians intended to make use of gas, the possession of respirators would be madecompulsory, and this may have been done already./ apan.8. It is improbable that the whole of the Japanese population, particularly those scattered in the smaller islands, are equipped for gas defence on the sames cale as ourselves or other European nations, and that, if Japan thought hermain islands liable to attack, retaliation would be feared. Against this, with thepresent Japanese strategic advantages, the threat of the use of gas against someof the territories which she is now menacing would be extremely serious, since thepopulation in these territories are also ill-equipped for gas defence.Note. Certain references are also made in Appendix B to enemy prepara-tions which apply equally to air and ground.[23722]
ANNEX 3.Chemical Warfare.General Value of Chemical Warfare as a Weapon.1. Chemical Warfare under modern conditions and with modern weapons isas yet untried; there must remain an element of chance in the initiation of this form of warfare.2. Gas is an additional type of weapon which can only be used at theexpense of those already in use. When employed for the first time, surprise andthe psychological factors predominate, and their effect may be great for a period.The duration of this period and the ultimate results gained will depend on thenature of the people being attacked and the scale of their anti-gas preparations.In Well-Prepared Countries.3. In a country where anti-gas preparations are good and morale is highthe psychological effect of a heavy and sustained attack might be considerable fora week or two. Thereafter the effect would be only slightly greater than that of asimilar scale of normal bombing.In these circumstances, therefore, Chemical Warfare is only of real importance as a weapon of surprise.In Unprepared Countries.4. In countries which are unprepared for Chemical Warfare and where thestandard of intelligence and morale is low, the situation is likely to be very different. Not only will the initial effect be very much greater, resulting probably in widespread panic, but a state of almost complete disorganization and helpless-ness is likely to persist as long as attacks are.maintained. It follows that, in thesecircumstances, Chemical Warfare may be of immense strategic importance, asproved to be the case in Abyssinia in 1935.5. The foregoing views form the basis of the following assessment of theeffect of the introduction of Chemical Warfare into theatres of war in which weare engaged.Europe.Effects on Germany.6. We are in a position to employ 25 per cent, of our bombing effort inChemical Warfare. The introduction of this type of warfare will, however, pro-duce no new or startling results, since there are no targets in Germany, thegassing of which would produce decisive results. The use of gas will merelyincrease by a moderate amount the effectiveness of our normal bombing attacks,and is unlikely to cause the Germans to alter their present plans.Effects on the United Kingdom Now.7. It is believed that the Germans might devote 20 to 25 per cent, of their normal bomber effort to the use of gas. At the present low scale of attack thiswould result in a sustained gas effort of 10 sorties each 24 hours, or an intensiveeffort for a period of a week of 20 sorties each 24 hours.8. Such a scale of attack should have only a slight effect on the morale of thepopulation of this country and for a very limited period. It would afford the civilian population and the A.R.P. Services an opportunity to accustom themselvesto Chemical Warfare and to perfect anti-gas measures. The effect on industry,transport services, docks, &amp;c. would be little greater than that resulting from asimilar scale of normal bombing.9. Even if we were using gas against Germany, the Germans might decidenot to use gas against this country until they were in a position to employ against us a much greater bombing effort.
10. If Germany succeeds in freeing air forces from the Russian front, shewill be able to increase her attacks on this country and may decide to use gason a large scale.   Even in those circumstances it is doubtful whether she wouldCgain any great material results from its use, although the psychological factoris, of course, unpredictable. Just as much, if not more, interference with the life of the country eould be obtained by the use of H.E. and incendiaries.Effects on Combined Operations.11.   In land operations, chemical warfare is likely to favour the defendersrather than the attackers once surprise has been overcome.    This is due to itsslowing-up effect and the fact that retiring forces can leave areas contaminatedwhen giving ground.   Its introduction, therefore, may well turn the scale in the ifortunes of a combined operation or landing on the Continent.12. It is believed that the Germans in Northern France are well preparedfor gas warfare, though the French population is probably not well equippedagainst gas. Its introduction is likely, therefore, to reduce our chances of success in any operations in that area.Conclusion.13. In Western Europe the introduction of Chemical Warfare is unlikely to afford us any worthwhile advantage in the near future. If andwhen we are able to undertake an offensive on the Continent, introduction of chemical Warfare may well react to our disadvantage.Middle East.14. In the Middle East we are in a position to devote 25 per cent, of the bomber effort to gas warfare, but on land we are seriously short of equipment,The enemy is believed to be well prepared both in the air and on land.15. Generally speaking, the desert is not a good area for the effective useof gas, except against defended localities, such as Tobruk.16. Under present circumstances the scale of air attack which we can deliveragainst Italy is negligible, nor is it likely to become very great. A successfuladvance in Cyrenaica would still not enable us to launch any decisive air attack against Italy.17. On the other hand, the Axis can attack Malta, Cairo and Alexandria.The civilian A.R.P. arrangements in Egypt are poor and the effects of gas attackon the native population are likely to be very considerable and to raise acuteinternal security problems.18. It may be, however, that the Italians will try to dissuade the germans from using gas in the Middle East, since their own civilian population is not toowell protected, though their efforts in this direction will be related to our ability to launch air attacks against them.Conclusion.19. In the Middle East theatre, the introduction of Chemical Warfarewould be greatly to our disadvantage.Indian Ocean Theatre.20. Although Service personnel in the Indian Ocean theatre are fullyprotected against gas warfare, the civilian population is completely unprotected.It is believed that the Japanese armed forces are well equipped in all respectsfor Chemical Warfare.21. Calcutta and other large towns offer excellent targets for attack, andthe results of such attacks would be very far reaching. We are completelyunequipped to wage Chemical Warfare offensively in the Indian Ocean theatre;moreover, there are no vulnerable Japanese targets against which we couldretaliate.
Conclusion.22.   We are definitely not in a position to wage Chemical Warfare inthe Indian Ocean theatre.Australasia.23. Australia and New Zealand are virtually unprepared for chemical warfare either offensively or defensively.Summary of Conclusions.24. In the European theatre the introduction of Chemical Warfare is unlikely to afford us any worthwhile advantage in the near future. In the longrun, it is probable that we should be at a disadvantage.25. In the Middle East, Indian Ocean and Australasian theatres the intru-duction of Chemical Warfare would be greatly to our disadvantage.
