THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 212.May 20, 1942.4WAR CABINET.UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALS ON POST-WARRELIEF.Memorandum by the. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will no doubt have seen the memorandum handed to me lastweek by Mr. Winant on the subject of Post-War Relief.2. The United States Government propose a meeting of the principal AlliedPowers and then a Conference of the &quot; United Nations &quot; with a view to settingup a Relief Organisation at Washington. It will be recalled that, as a resultof the St. James&apos;s Palace Conference last autumn, an Inter-Allied Committeewas set up to prepare plans for European relief. Since the St. James&apos;s PalaceConference, the area affected by hostilities has vastly increased, the United states have come into the war and the twenty-six &quot; United Nations &quot; have issued theirDeclaration of the 1st January, 1942. The United States in effect now proposethat the problem of post-war relief, having become one of world-wide scope,should be transferred from the orbit of the European Allies to that of theUnited Nations.3. It must be obvious that for the success of any post-war relief scheme the contribution of the United States will be all-important. For that reason alonewe should be well advised to fall in with the American proposals. But I fancythat there is much more than post-war relief in question. The United states administration appear to be acting on the thesis that the more international machinery that can be got into operation with their participation before the endof the war, the greater the likelihood of American public opinion being ready tocontinue international co-operation after the war. It would perhaps be puttingit too high at this stage to say that the Administration definitely intend to try and establish under the aegis of the &quot; United Nations &quot; the embryo of the inter-national organisation of the future. American post-war co-operation in theinternational sphere being so vitally important, I submit that we must play upto any scheme of theirs tending to turn the United Nations into an operativepiece of machinery.4. In the circumstances I hope my colleagues will agree to action on thefollowing lines : (a) The Dominions and India should be told at once that we strongly favouracceptance of the United States proposals and that, subject to their concurrence, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdompropose to inform the United States Ambassador as soon as possiblethat we warmly welcome his Government&apos;s proposals, which we accept in principle, and that we shall be prepared to give them such support as they desire in securing their acceptance by the Soviet and other allied Governments.(b) On receipt of replies from the Dominions and India I should so inform mr. Winant.(c) If agreeable to the United States Government we should work for ajoint Anglo-American-Soviet proposal to lay before the Inter-AlliedCommittee.A.
