As regardsthe finished products,  discussions are proceeding, andI trust that we shall be able to make reasonable offersto satisfy the Russian demands.      In the  case of general service respirators, however,, the Russian ^Delegationhave asked for 3 million respirators,. and the War office are unwilling to make any recommendation towards ful-filling tills request without further evidence of theRussian needs, which it will clearly be difficult toobtain.4a The Russian Delegation have emphasised thatthese respirators are required urgently to equip front-line personnel at present unprotected, and not for building up reserves0      There is no means of verifyingwhether this is a fair quantitative stat government of their needs, but the delegates clearly regard it as of extreme importance, mid it is one of the   main objects oftheir present visit,.

5o The limiting factor in the manufacture of this equipment is the availability of rubber supplies.     For1942, 2,500 tons of rubber has been allocated, of which1,400 tons has been earmarked for Service respirators,and 1?100 tons for civilian types.      This allocation will permit of a production programme of about 500,000 G.S.respirators pe-   month until the end of 1942.      This is tomeet    the require. :onts of all British GovernmentDepartments (Fighting Services, Police, Civil defence personnel, etc), as well as &quot;repayment customers&quot; e.g.india     Any allocation of the finished product which ismade to Russia will accordingly involve making anadditional allotment to the War Office of raw rubbersufficient to make it goods69 The known commitments for General Servicerespirators1 are for a total of some 6 million.      Between4 million and 6 million can be produced from available supplies of raw rubber, the   number being determined bya decision whether the whole manufacture is to be ofthe G.So respirators or of the new   light assaultrespirator which contains less rubbere7* The stock in hand is said to amount to between1 million and 1% million G.S. respirators.     This is insufficient to meet existing known commitments,  andany allocation to the Russians would necessarily be at the expense of these demands.      it is forconsideration however, whether an immediate bulkallocation of at least 1 million respirators could bemade,.      This would necessarily be at considerablesacrifice to our own requirements, which.will have tobe(shared proportionately by all users.8. Owing to the time factor mentioned inparagraph 2v, an offer to supply any part of the balanceof the Russian demand, over a period of months, could hardly be of value.A.B.6th May, 1942,,

The most that can be done without serious effects on the distribution ofchlorine in this country and to Palestine for bromine manufactureis to find 150 old type American chlorine drums, which would holdy/ 120 tons chlorine-      The drums are quite sound and suitable for use.(e) Bleach,grade of bleach &quot;Maxochlor&quot;, containing 70%L  in this country, but itsin any case, was only on awe can offer is tropical bleach,chlorine P^OOO tons of tropical .tons of bleach containing 66%At one t imeavailable chlorine., was made by I,Cmanufacture has been abandoned and,small scale.      The only alternativeProm the point of view of availablebleach would be equivalent to 1,000available chlorinee      If the Russians want the tropical bleach, itis suggested that 2,000 tons could be taken from the very substantial stocks in this country and replaced by furthermanufacture.      If this is agreed, then the 2,000 tons could besupplied as rapidly as shipping space could be provided.      Theconcurrence of the Ministry of home Security would be necessary,since the 2,000 tons would come from their stocks.

(f) ChioroccetophenonooImpossible to supply.      Our own production is very smalland is incapable of meeting our own demands so that we are having to purchase from the U.S.A.(g) Monochlorami.no   md DicaloraminerThere is no significant production of Dichloramine inthis country.With regard to Monochloramine, v/e can offer 60 tons now,v/hich we happen to have in stock? and 15 tons/week over the nextfew months.(h) Hop ca lite aThere is no significant production in this country and none is available for exports(i) Silica Gel,The capacity in this country is only 10 tons/week, none of which can he spared-,-4-
