Molotov was anxious to place before the British Governmentthe views held by the Soviet Government on the subject of an invasion of theContinent.M. MOLOTOV said that he had been charged by the Soviet Government tocome to London to discuss the question of the establishment of a &quot; Second Front.&quot;[23856]
This was no new problem. It had first been raised nearly ten months ago and now,more recently, the impetus had come from President Roosevelt, who had suggested to M. Stalin that he (M. Molotov) should go to the United States to discuss thisquestion. Although, therefore, the initiative for the present enquiry had comefrom the United States, the Soviet Government had thought it right that he should proceed to the United States via London, since it was upon Great Britain thatthe main task for organising the &apos;&apos; Second Front&quot; would initially fall.Speaking generally, M. Molotov said that the Soviet Government considered this to be a most urgent and pressing problem, in which both Great Britainand Russia were vitally concerned. It was indeed a matter for discussion with complete frankness, as becoming conversations between Aliies. On the russian front, operations of the greatest intensity and importance were now impendingand the weeks and months which lay immediately ahead were fraught with themost serious consequences to the Soviet Union and their Allies. During last winter, the Soviet Army had got the better of Hitler&apos;s Army, and had immediatelyset about preparing for the campaign of 1942. Nevertheless, the SovietGovernment contemplated a fierce and bitter struggle in which the germans would not yield easily or quickly. In this battle, the main weight would fall upon the Soviet Army. They were proud of this honour. On both sides, immenseforces, backed by mighty armaments, were. ranged against each other. Thematerial aid rendered by,Great Britain and the States was highly prizedand appreciated by the Soviet Government. Nevertheless, the most urgent issues were involved in the establishment of a &quot; Second Front.&quot;The object of his (M. Molotov&apos;s) visit was to learn how the British Govern-ment viewed the prospects of drawing off in 1942 some of the German forces fromthe U.S.S.R., where it seemed that, at the present time, the balance of advantage in armed strength lay with the Germans. It should be remembered that Hitlercollected vast forces and resources seized from the subjugated and enslavedpeoples scattered over a greater part of Europe. They could not ignore the dangerof the situation on their front.In concrete terms, the proposal he had to make was as follows : The allies of the U.S.S.R., and in the first place Great Britain, should draw off from theRussian front in the summer and autumn of 1942 at least 40 German divisions,and engage them in fighting in Western Europe. If this should be the case, thedoom of Hitler would be sealed in 1942. At any rate, the decisive turn in thisdirection would be effected in the present year. Could the Allies do it ? He wouldlike to hear the answer of the British Government to this question.Mr. CHURCHILL said that, in all previous wars, control of the sea had given the Power possessing it the great advantage of being able to land, at will,on the enemy&apos;s coast, since it was impossible for the enemy to be prepared at every point to meet seaborne invasion. The advent of air power had altered thewhole situation. For example, in France and the Low Countries the enemy couldmove his Air Forces in a few hours to threatened points anywhere along thecoast; and bitter experience had shown that landing, in the teeth of enemy air opposition, was not a sound military proposition. The inescapable conse-quence was that large portions of the Continental coastline were denied to us as places for disembarkation. We were forced, therefore, to study our chancesat those parts of the coast where our superior fighter force would give us control in the air. Our choice was, in fact, narrowed down to the Pas-de-Calais, theCherbourg &quot; tip &quot; and part of the Brest area. The problem of landing a force this year in one or more of these areas was being studied, and preparations werebeing made, with the utmost energy. Our plans were being based on theassumption that the landing of successive waves of assault troops would bringabout air battles which, if continued over a week or ten days, would lead to the virtual destruction of the enemy&apos;s air power on the Continent. Once this was achieved and the air opposition removed, landings at other points on the coastcould be effected under cover, of our superior sea power. The crucial point inmaking our plans and preparations was the availability of the special landing craft required for effecting the initial landing on the very heavily defendedenemy coastline. Unfortunately, our resources in this special type of craft were,for the time being, strictly limited. As far back as last August, at the Atlanticmeeting, he (Mr. Churchill) had impressed upon President Roosevelt the urgent need for the United States to build as large a number of tank landing and otherassault craft as possible. Later, in January of this year, the President had agreed
that the United States should make an even larger effort to construct these craft.We, for our part, for more than a year, had-been turning out as large a numberof assault craft as our need for constructing ships for the Navy and MercantileMarine, which had suffered grievous losses, permitted.In April. President Roosevelt had sent Mr. Hopkins and General Marshallto London with the proposal that the United States should join with GreatBritain, at the earliest date, in taking the greatest possible weight off Russia.We had immediately agreed to this proposal, and joint studies were proceedingapace. It could not be expected, however, that United States forces would beavailable till very late in 1942, or that the landing craft we so urgently required would be available in large numbers this year. By 1st August we should have only 383 landing craft: by 1st September 566. In 1943, very much larger numberswould be available, and we could descend on the enemy coast at five or six points,anywhere between the North Cape and Bayonne. It was, however, the earnestresolve of the British Government to see what could be done this year to givethe much-needed support to the valiant Russian armies, who were confronting so large a part of Germany&apos;s military might, and had already inflicted such deepwounds upon it.Two points should, however, be borne in mind. First, with the best will and endeavour, it was unlikely that any move we could maike in 1942, even if it were successful, would draw off large numbers of enemy land forces from the eastern front. In the air, however, the position was different; in the various theatres ofwar we were already containing about one-half of the Fighter and one-third ofthe German Bomber strength. If our plan for forcing air battles over theContinent proved successful, the Germans might be faced with the choice either of seeing the whole of their fighter air force in the West destroyed, or of makingwithdrawals &quot;from their air strength in the East.The second point related to M. Molotov&apos;s proposition that our aim shouldbe to draw off (including those now in the West) not less than 40 german divisions from Russia. It should be noted that, at the present time, we hadconfronting us in Libya 11 Axis divisions, of which 3 were German, the equivalent of 8 German divisions in Norway, and 25 German divisions in France and theLow Countries.   These totalled 44 divisions.But we were not satisfied with that, and if any further effort could be made or plan devised, provided it was sound and sensible, for. drawing the weight offRussia this year, we should not hesitate to put it into effect. Clearly, it wouldnot further either the Russian cause or that of the Allies as a whole if, for the sake of action at any price, we embarked on some operation which ended indisaster and gave the enemy an opportunity for glorification at our discomfiture.Thus, to sum up, we and the United States would do everything that wasphysically possible to meet the wishes of the Russian Government and Nation inthis matter.M. MOLOTOV enquired whether the views expressed by Mr. Churchill wereshared by the United States Government on the subject of the second front.Mr. CHURCHILL said that the United States Government shared tc thefull our resolve to operate on the Continent with the largest possible forces atthe earliest possible moment. This was their ardent desire, and in 1943 our jointplans contemplated the landing of a force of up to 1\ million United States-British troops on the Continent.The United States were anxious to take their share in any operations carriedout this year, but their contribution in the near future would not be on any considerable scale. As an earnest of their intent, we had with us now in Londona number of American officers who were collaborating closely with our staffs inthe preparation of plans; and more were on their way.M. MOLOTOV then asked whether it was possible and appropriate to make an estimate of the percentage of British troops, including those on all fronts,employed on active operations against the enemy, at any one peak month duringthe. last few months.- Mr. CHURCHILL said that the proportion of British troops on all frontsactually at grips with the enemy was naturally small. Pie went on to explainin general terms the dispositions of our forces; up to 50,000 men a month were leaving our shores for the Middle and Far East theatres.
M. MOLOTOV said that he had no doubt that Great Britain genuinelywished for the success of the Soviet Army against the Germans this summer.What, in the view of the British Government, were the prospects of Sovietsuccess? Whatever their views might be he would be glad to have a frankexpression of opinion-good or bad.Mr. CHURCHILL said that, without detailed knowledge of the resources and reserves on both sides, it was difficult to form a firm judgement on thisquestion. Last year the military experts, including those of Germany, had thought that the Soviet Army might be borne down and overcome. They had proved quite wrong. In the event the Soviet forces had defeated Hitler and nearly brought his army to disaster. Consequently Russia&apos;s Allies felt greatconfidence in the strength and ability of the Soviet Army.The Intelligence available to the British Government did not indicate themassing of vast German forces at any particular point on the eastern front.Moreover, the full-scale offensive heralded for May now seemed unlikely to takeplace before June. Tn any event, it did not seem that Hitler&apos;s attack thisyear could be as strong or so menacing as that of 1941. In making this state-men he (Mr. Churchill) did not wish it to be inferred that we were asking ourguests for information which they might be reluctant to disclose.M. MOLOTOV, in reply, agreed that nobody could be expected to makeaccurate prophecies about the future. The great Russian country and peoplebelieved in their own strength, but they also believed in facing up to the worstpossibilities. Supposing the Soviet Army failed to hold out against themaximum effort which Hitler would undoubtedly exert during 1942, what wouldbe then the position and the attitude of the British Government ?Mr. CHURCHILL said that if the Russians were defeated or the soviet military power was seriously reduced by the German onslaught, Hitler would, inall probability, move as many troops and air forces as possible back to the West,with the object of invading Great Britain. He might also strike down throughBaku to the Caucasus and Persia. This would expose us to the gravest dangers,and we should by no means feel satisfied that we had sufficient forces to ward offthe latter thrust. Therefore, our fortunes were bound up with the resistance of theSoviet Army. Nevertheless, if, contrary to expectation, they were defeated, andthe worst came to the worst, we should fight on, and with the help of the UnitedStates, hope to build up overwhelming Air superiority, which, in the course of thenext 18 months or 2 years would enable us to put down a devastating weight ofair attack on the German cities and industries. We should, moreover, maintainthe blockade and make landings on the Continent against an increasinglyenfeebled opposition. Ultimately, the power of Great Britain and the UnitedStates would prevail. It should not be overlooked that after the fall of FranceGreat Britain had stood alone for a whole year with but a handful of ill-equippedtroops between her and Hitler&apos;s victorious and numerous divisions.But what a tragedy for mankind would be this prolongation of the war, and how earnest was the hope for Russian victory and how ardent the desire thatwe should take our share in conquering the evil foe. He, Mr. Churchill, wishedM. Molotov to realise that it vvas the dearest wish of the British nation and army to come to grips with the enemy at the earliest moment and so to. aid thegallant fight of the Russian Army and people.In conclusion, Mr. Churchill asked M. Molotov to bear in mind the difficultyof oversea invasions. After France fell out of the war, we in Great Britain were almost naked a few ill-equipped divisions, less than 100 tanks and less than200 Field guns. And yet Hitler had not attempted an invasion, by reason of thefact that he could not get command of the air. The same sort of difficultiesconfronted us at the present time. He suggested that General Isayev and admiral Kharlamov should meet Lieutenant-General Nye and Vice-AdmiralLord Louis Mountbatten that afternoon, in order that they might be told the exact position as regards the special landing craft necessary for overseasoperations. eM. MOLOTOV agreed. He thanked Mr. Churchill for what he had said.He would carefully report to his Government. In conclusion, he would like tosay that the Russian people also believed in their strength and in the strengthof their Allies.
