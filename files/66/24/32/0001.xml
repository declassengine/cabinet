SECRET.Printed for the War Cabinet.-siay 1942.Copy No.   2,9W.P. (^2) 202.May 13, 1942.WAR CABINET.PLEBISCITE IN CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I append below, for the information of the War Cabinet, a summary of areport by the Acting High Commissioner at Ottawa on the plebiscite held inCanada on the 27th April.1.   The form in which the plebiscite was put was as follows : &quot; Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligationarising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military service&apos;? &quot;The dominant facts of the situation as revealed by the figures are as follows :that there is an all-over vote of 63 per cent, for &apos;&apos; Yes &apos;&apos; : that Province of Quebecvoted 72 per cent, for &quot; No&quot; : that if the French-Canadian vote in the other provinces were added to the Quebec vote the result might be that somethingbetween 80 and 90 per cent, of French-Canadians voted &quot; No &quot; : that, similarly,if the French-Canadian vote were subtracted, the vote of the rest of canada would be 80 per cent, or more for &quot; Yes.&quot;2. The general atmosphere following the declaration of the poll is one ofconfusion and of some humiliation, and it is difficult to see what course theGovernment will take to lead them out of their present predicament. ThePrime Minister stated to the press : &apos;&apos; The result is a national expression of view on a national issue. It should be so viewed in all its aspects. In all of theprovinces, affirmative and negative votes have been cast. The vote was taken ina democratic fashion and it will be recognised throughout the country that, ina democracy, the will of the majority prevails. The Government asked that itshands should be free at a time of war. The people have expressed the viewthat the Government is to be free and Parliament to be free to discuss and decideeach and every aspect of the country&apos;s war effort solely upon its merits. the judgment and the action of the Government and Parliament will no longer be restricted in any way in dealing with every situation in the light of what is bestfor Canada and for Canada&apos;s war effort.....While the result of the plebisciteis largely in the affirmative, and therefore gratifying to the Government, it isnot to be construed either as a vote of confidence in the present administrationor as a vote for any political party.&quot;3. Great pains had been taken by government speakers throughout the campaign to present the issue not as one for or against conscription but as one for or against freeing the Government of any past commitments. The distinctionwas always too subtle. Certainly the Conservatives never intended to represent an affirmative vote in the plebiscite as anything else but a vote for the immediateapplication of conscription. Their papers the next day made no bones about[23823]
it. The Ottawa Journal, for instance, iii a leader entitled &quot; Plebiscite is a mandate,&quot; while admitting that &quot; Technically within the strict letter of the plebiscite&quot; the vote was to release Mr. King from a pledge, said that it was&quot;sophistry&quot; to regard it as only that. &quot;Mr. King is not merely given a mandate to bring conscription : he is ordered to bring it, and decisively. Letno hair-splitting nor loose thinking make us misunderstand that.&quot;4. The best friends of Quebec among the English-speaking Canadians have suffered a severe disappointment and the tempers of the most tolerant are frayed.They had hoped that there was in Quebec a substantial body of informed andco-operative opinion. They had hoped that in response to the extremeconsideration which the Liberal Government have consistently given to theirsusceptibilities the French-Canadians would have taken this signal opportunityfor a generous gesture of unity. Quebec has not played up to these expectations.In her defence &quot;it is urged that the issue has never been made clear to French-Canada. For 25 years the Liberal party has positively encouraged, for thepurpose of making&quot; political capital out of it, the anti-conscriptionist sentimentof French-Canadians; and other parties have pandered to it. How could thesentiment so fostered for a quarter of a century be expected to change by itself in a few weeks? Nor did the Government, even after the announcement of the plebiscite, appear even to attempt any presentation of the case whatsoever tilltwo weeks before the poll, although they watched supinely in the intervening period an active, audacious and unscrupulous campaign being waged againstconscription. Even up to zero hour French-Canadians have always been told that conscription is not necessary. Their feelings on conscription represent aracial attitude which Mr. Mackenzie King endorsed in his original no conscrip-tion pledge : and there has never been any statement since that the government itself has changed its mind.5. However it may be, Quebec is now self-isolated from the rest of theDominion, and appears to many eyes as having even voted itself out of thecompany of allied nations. For this most painful exposure of Canadian disunitythe plebiscite is blamed.6. The whole idea of having a plebiscite had been hotly attacked from thebeginning in many quarters. Both those who opposed and those who supported the plebiscite are ready to turn and rend the Government to-day for havingresorted to a device which has not only failed to clear the issue, but has exposedin its full nakedness the lack of national unity, of which Canada is at all timesnervously conscious.7. The main preoccupation of the man in the street, is what result this willhave on American opinion. So long as America has the draft and Canada hasnot, the whole Canadian war effort is disparaged in American eyes. Withoutthe draft, for all Canada is doing to-day, and has done since the inception of thewar, and for all the shortcomings of the United States effort, Canada cannot feel,and feels that the United States cannot feel, that hers is a total war effort in comparison with America&apos;s. The plebiscite has given Canada the best publicitybreak which it has yet enjoyed in the United States in the whole war. In theAmerican press Canada gets general praise &apos;&apos; for going on record in favour ofan all out war, adopting conscription for service in battle zones all over theworld, and the manner in which this was done by popular vote covering theentire Dominion was another example of a free democracy functioning in greatshape during the most critical time in the world&apos;s history.&quot; America will thinkit bathos if the result of this vote is anything but drastic action : and it is this consideration as much as any other which will keep this issue a burning one.The majority vote in Canada is certainly looking for action, though they arcperhaps a bit taken aback by the size of the anti vote and recognise a bit morethan they did before the difficulties which lie in the path.8. The Erench Press emphasises that Quebec has confirmed, as was itsdemocratic right, its opposition to conscription, and justified this generally onthe grounds that they have confidence in the voluntary system proving adequate tothe situation. Quebec has reposed long trust in Mr. Mackenzie King. He has asked to be released from his pledges and Quebec has refused : but &quot;while they recognise that the rest of Canada has given him a very different answer, they
still naively trust that he will, for their sakes and for old times&apos; sake, find someway of not doing what he has asked for freedom to do. The Ligue pour laDefense du Canada, which was formed by the more violent opponents of conscrip-tion to fight the plebiscite issue, has published a manifesto maintaining that neither the Government nor the present Parliament are freed by the plebiscitefrom their engagement towards French-Canada, which stands because French-Canada has not renounced. There is a suggestion of bitter campaigning andeven violent action being organised in Quebec against any possibility of conscrip-tion. In fact, the Ligue maintains that the position remains exactly as it was in1939 and 1940. Taking it all in all, perhaps it is not too sanguine to hope thatQuebec, though she may not have liked conscription when asked, may &quot; lump &quot;it when ordered.The High Commissioner has since reported that on the 11th MayMr. Mackenzie King introduced a Bill to remove the restriction on the Govern-ment against calling up men for the services outside Canada. The Prime minister stated that this action was in accordance with the will of the people as expressedin the plebiscite. M. Cardin, Minister of Transport, who was the senior Quebecrepresentative in the Cabinet, has resigned.C. R. A.May 13, 1942.
