?aauested that speci*d care may be taken t&amp;ttnsura the secrecy of this document.(this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)MOST secret.p. (U2)1&amp;U1st MAY, 19^2.COPY NO.WAR CABINETTHE DEFENCE OF INDIANote by the Secretary of the War Cabinet.The attached telegram from General Wavell (Annex I),and the Prime Minister&apos;s reply (Annex II), are circulatedto the War Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister.The telegram at Annex II was agreed with the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff before despatch.The Prime Minister does not think it necessary to summon a special meeting of the War Cabinet to consider the telegramat Annex I.(Signed)    E.  E.  BRIDGES.great George Street, S.W.1.1st May, 19U2.ANNEX I.Telegram from Commander-in-Chief, India, No.10577/0?Dated 30th April, 19U2.Personal for G.I.G.S. from General Wavell.1. War Cabinet must really make up their minds whether ornot they propose to defend India and Ceylon seriously.    &apos; Atpresent we are getting continual messages stressing vitalimportance of Ceylon and at same time our means of defendingit are being removed.2. We were led to expect effective naval force based onCeylon by end March (CCS, India 1+2). This proved illusorysince battleships sent were quite incapable of engagingJapanese fleet and had to be removed.      Other telegrams howeverled us to expect squadron of modern ships by end of May.      Nowdate has   been transferred to end of June.     All effective

naval forces are being removed from Indian Ocean during Mayand June and there is strong probability of ships for EasternFleet suffering loss or damage in Mediterranean operationsbefore fleet is even formed.3, It is recognised that air forces being provided for defence of India and Ceylon are quite inadequate to stop seaborne invasions which-absence of naval force enables japanese to carry out unchecked.h. At this crises it is proposed to reduce the slenderresources in land forces which we hoped would shortly beavailable by five brigades (two Australian two British oneAfrican).      This seems to me sheer madness if it is reallyintended to hold Ceylon and India as is professed policy.5. I have been given no official information aboutIronclad beyond that contained in WoOc  telegrams 79hl0 (I.S.S.B.)of 30/3 and 79246 (McQo 12a)  of 29/3 which indicated 29thIndependent Brigade Group intended for operation.      Telegramunder reply is first intimation that &amp;bh Division concerned.6. Matter of East African Brigades is so typical of casualway in which Indian defence problem has been treated   that i must give some account of what has happened.since November lastwhen Japanese threat appeared imminent and,  following onliquidation of Gondar,  I requested consideration of use of east African troops in Burma or Ceylon to relieve calls on indian troops, already heavy and anticipated^7* In December I was told that one African brigade group wouldbe ready to sail from Massawa at end of January and a  secondon 21st February.      Both Brigades were allotted to Burma,estimated arrival dates at Rangoon being 15/2 and 9/3 respect-ively.      Continual delays followed,  attributed to  shippingleave for East African Units and later to excessive rains.Ultimately one Brigade group had to be diverted to ceylon and arrived there about 15/3-      I have received no reply toquery as to whether second Brigade Group is  still allotted tome but have been told that it will not be ready to embark atMombasa before 1/6 at earliest.      Thus,  in spite of urgent needfor troops, it took three and a half months to provide oneBrigade and will be six and half months before second Brigadearrives, at earliest.      Had this problem been tackled seriouslyand energetically and any real thought been given to our needsI can hardly believe that these delays could net have beenreduced.      I would add that when demands of this nature havebeen made on India and accepted, we have seen to it thai, nodifficulties are put in way of earliest despatch.      Even moredisturbing was.fact that I was not informed of delays and was allowed to contj rue making plans based on arrival of theseBrigades when it   must have been known -;o someone that  therewas no prospect of programme being kepta      This had seriousinfluence on course of events in Burma.      Two AustralianBrigades in Ceylon have- only just completed unloading their equipment within last few days.      It has taken about  six weeksowing to cnTicrpts+p&apos;^. -v, h orb our and difficulties of labour,  andhas largoiy been done by Australians themselves.      If Brigades-2-

are to be removed, reloading will presumably take approx-imately same time and will prolong or increase dangerouscongestion of shipping.8. You are aware of military position in India.      Ihave entirely inadequate Field Force in N,Ei India of threeincomplete divisions to defend Assam Bengal and Orissa,threat to which is of course increased by recent events in burma.      I have seven Brigades (including one local) in ceylon.     For remainder of India my Field Force is onepartially trained division.      I have lately scraped togethergeneral reserve of three British battalions by taking riskswith internal security but am unwilling to take additionalrisk of sending these battalions outside India.      IfAustralian Brigades are removed I cannot replace them.9- Frankly I do not see how you can reconcile what isnow proposed with para. 15 of 0,0.3. ME 259.10,       Unless War Cabinet considers Ironclad of greaterstrategical importance than Ceylon they are taking very grave risks indeed in diverting so large proportion ofmeagre resources in east to it.      If they do consider it of such importance I think I should be informed so that Ican regulate policy accordingly.11,       Finally there is political aspect to be considered.India has sent all her troops, as soon as sufficientlyequipped and trained (and usually before), to fight outsideIndia at request of H.M.G.      There are at present momentequivalent of about seven Indian Divisions in Middle East,a much larger and better trained force than is avalTablein India itself.      There is continuous pressure here forthese troops to- return to India&apos; to defend their home country.I have so far   been able to resist this and to do something to maintain sinking Indian morale by assurances that H.M.G.are determined to give e^-ery possible assistance to defenceof India and that large reinforcements are arriving now.I cannot honourably continue to give these assurances ifreinforcements for India are constantly diverted or deferredlike this.      I must request firm policy which will be adhered12.       I request that this telegram be laid before WarCabinet, before any further decisions on defence forces forIndia are taken.13&quot;.       Viceroy has seen this telegram and concurs.

/annex II.Telegram from Prime Minister to Commander-in-chief8India, No.  T 5367&amp;, dated 1st May, 1 9h.&quot;2*TI have given immediate personal consideration to your10577 C      The two Brigades of 6th Australian Division will notmove from Ceylon until they are relieved by two of the Brigadesof 5th Division.      The remaining brigade of that Division anddivisional troops are moving straight on to India.      As soon asarrangements can be made to replace the 29th Independent brigade group which is one of our best and most highly trained Brigadesin IRONCLAD by inferior troops, it will also come forward to you.The whole of the 2nd Division should also be with you by. June 8unless Australia is actually heavily invaded meanwhile, in which case India&apos;s danger would be diminished.      As against this thesecond in order of the two African Brigades you were expecting,one of which.you already have, will have to go to garrisonIRONCLAD if operation is&apos; successful.2. Operation IRONCLAD on which War Cabinet is resolved dateof which will be cabled separately, involves 29th IndependentBrigade Group plus one Commando and one Brigade of the 5thDivision.      A second Brigade of the 5th Division is standing byat sea as a potential reserve.      It is however hoped that thedelay to this Brigade will be short, as Vichy garrison ofIRONCLAD is reported to consist only of local native troops with about two hundred French officers, against which we are puttingeleven thousand of our best troops.J5. India has a real interest in IRONCLAD as a Japanese fleetestablished there would paralyse our communications with India.kp We are sorry about the need of moving the two AustralianBrigades from Ceylon, but it was always understood with theCommonwealth Government that they were only stopped offtemporarily to meet emergency.      You had no grounds for countingon them as a permanency,.      Of. course, if an actual attack tookplace before they left it would not be possible to let them goeven though their reliefs had arrived.5. We fully understand and share your anxieties but exceptfor a short delay in respect of two Brigades of the 5th division and the withholding of the second African Brigade you should be stronger and not weaker than you had been led to expect.6. Your paras.  6 and 7 will be the subject of a separatetelegram.
