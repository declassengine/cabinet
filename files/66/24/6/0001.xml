COMBINED OPERATIONS.1. In a minor combined operation in the early hours of the 22nd April two small military reconnaissance forces were sent with the intention of landing inthe neighbourhood of Boulogne.One force penetrated enemy defences to a depth of about half a mile,remaining ashore for two hours. They exchanged fire with German patrols, butsuffered no casualties, with the exception of one man wounded. No prisoners weresecured. This force, having carried out a reconnaissance, then withdrew with all its arms and equipment.The other force failed to land. - Light craft carrying it became separated,and before the craft regained contact an action between enemy armed trawlers and escorting British craft took place.One trawler was set on fire and another was damaged. None of the Britishcraft was damaged and the naval casualties were only three killed.naval SITUATION.General Review.2.   Two of our destroyers have been mined off the East Coast.Shipping losses reported have been less than of late.Home Waters.3. On the 20th H.M. Destroyers Cotswold and Quorn were mined offAldeburgh and have been towed to Harwich, where Cotswold has been beached.During the night of the 21st/22nd two M.G.Bs., 50 miles east of Orfordness,engaged at least six E-boats, one of which was set on fire. One M.G.B. was damaged, one rating being killed and three wounded.Northern Waters.4. Murmansk harbour was heavily raided by enemy aircraft on the 15th.Two British merchant ships were seriously damaged, one of which is a total loss.Mediterranean.5. During the night of the 15th/16th a landing party of Marines from.M. Destroyers Kelvin and Kipling destroyed the enemy wireless station atKupho Nisi off the south-east coast of Crete.  Four Marines were wounded.The Free French patrol vessel Viking was torpedoed and sunk by a ij-boat off Beirut on the 7th. Survivors have also been landed from six schoonersreported sunk by gunfire from a U-boat off Lebanon.A reinforcement of aircraft for Malta consisting of 47 Spitfires was successfully flown off from the American aircraft carrier Wasp on the 20th.In heavy air raids on Malta during the week the mine base, torpedoworkshops and depot were severely damaged, a minesweeping trawler was sunk and two merchant ships previously damaged are now a total loss. In addition,one tug was sunk and another damaged by near misses.During the week 38,535 tons of French merchant shipping eastbound, and10,207 tons westbound have passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. Eleven attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week; five by surface craft and six by aircraft. In no case was there definite evidence of destruction.Attacks by surface craft were carried out south of Bear Island in theBarents Sea, off the Orkneys, in the Gulf of Guinea and to the westward ofIreland.Aircraft made attacks in the Bay of Biscay area, off the south-west coast of norway and in the Freetown area. A Sunderland aircraft damaged a U-boatnorth-east of Port Said.
Enemy Intelligence.German.7. There is no change in the positions of main units, except that a report has been received that Gneisenau was being towed from Kiel to Gdynia about the11th April.Italian.8. The last two air reconnaissances of Messina have shown one Cavour classbattleship with cruisers and other craft present.Six merchant ships, totalling 39,000 tons, arrived in Tripoli (L) during thepast week, and four merchant ships, totalling 5,600 tons, are believed to havearrived at Benghazi, probably from Tripoli (L).Japanese.9. There are indications that the aircraft carriers, recently operating in theIndian Ocean, and several cruisers have returned to Japanese waters.U-Boats.10. The main concentration has continued to be in the West Atlantic.A large number has been reported on outward and homeward passage and others have been operating in the Barents Sea. Three U-boats and a supply ship were reported about 500 miles east of St. Paul Pocks in the South Atlantic on the 19th.German U-boats have been operating off the coast of Syria.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 22nd April, 936 ships, including 253 allied and 25 neutral, have been convoyed. Two cruisers, four anti-aircraft ships,80 destroyers (including seven American) and 100 sloops, corvettes and mine-sweepers (including five American corvettes) were employed on escort duties.American tanker sailings for the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and Atlanticports and all sailings of British ships from the Gulf of Mexico and the west indies have been, suspended for the present.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 18th April totalled 679,000 tons, compared with 424,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 624,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports 165,000 tons were oil of various kinds.During the month of March imports, other than mineral oil, were as follows :Ministry of Food 1,051,500 tons, Ministry of supply 870,400 tons, Board of Trade59,600 tons.   Total 1,981,500 tons.Enemy Attack on Trade.12. According to the information at present available, 11 ships, includingfour tankers, have been attacked by U-boats during the week, eight in the WestAtlantic and West Indies, one in convoy from Murmansk in the Barents Sea, one in the South-West Pacific and one off Beirut; of these four are known to havebeen sunk.Two ships were sunk by mines off Aldeburgh and one ship was seriously damaged in air raids on Malta and has become a total loss.British Minelaying.13. During the week mines were laid by surface craft in the East coast barrier, off the coasts of Brittany and Belgium and in the Faroes-Iceland (C)area. There has been considerable minelaying by aircraft off the Frisian Islands,Heligoland, the east coast of Denmark, Kiel harbour and French Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.14. Early on the 20th, E-boats laid a minefield in the war channel offAldeburgh. On one night in the week minelaying by enemy aircraft probablytook place in the war channels off the Norfolk coast.[23740] B 2
Twenty-seven moored mines and three magnetic mines have been destroyed in the Aldeburgh area during the week.The mine totals are 2,003 magnetic, 1,263 acoustic and 1,143 moored.Mediterranean.15. E-boats laid mines off the north-east and south-east coasts of Maltaduring the night of the 18th/19th.A minefield, presumably laid by a U-boat, has been found off Eamagusta,Cyprus, where six mines have been destroyed.A U-boat laid a minefield off Beirut probably on the night of the 15th/16th.One acoustic and two magnetic mines have been destroyed and the port isnow open.Enemy Merchant Shipping.16. A German report stated that an Italian motor vessel, probably thePietro Orseolo (6,344 tons), left Tokyo in February and has reached an Axis port.The Finnish s.s. Ergo (1,928 tons), which left Lisbon on the 17th, is believed to have a valuable German cargo on board.vichy Shipping.17. A naval tanker and an armed merchant cruiser with two submarinesare reported to have arrived at Dakar on the 20th April. The tanker is probably the Elorn, and the A.M.C. the Quercy. The former was due to leave Diego Suarezon the 15th March for Dakar with 9,000 tons of fuel, and the latter left Tamataveon the 4th March for Fort Dauphin to &quot; load military for France.&quot;American Intelligence.18. Seven battleships last reported on the American Pacific Coast left san francisco on the 14th April.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad Sector.19. The Russians claim, unofficially, to have cut the Leningrad-Dnorailwa)&apos;. The operation is believed to have been carried out by strong raidingparties. Otherwise there has been no activity and there is no further information regarding the beleaguered 16th German Army.Central Sector.20. The German claim to have annihilated four divisions of the Russian33rd Army refers to operations lasting over some three months. Confirmation isstill lacking and the claim is probably exaggerated. It is probable that theGermans have reduced some of the advanced positions which the Russians hareestablished behind the German forward defences. The German claim illustrates the extent of the Russian penetrations and the large number of troops involved.Ukraine.21.   Activity has been on a very small scale, due to thaw conditions.Crimea.22. Both sides are preparing for an offensive, and the weather is nowsuitable for operations.Summary.23. Thaw conditions, which are unusually severe, continue to limit opera-tions. All indications point to mid-May as the earliest date for a german offensive, although a local one in the Crimea might be staged sooner if theGermans can establish air superiority there. The number of German divisions on the Russian Front is 179, including 5 in Finland.
Libya.24. Activity has been confined to patrol and harassing operations. On the18th and 19th April severe sandstorms limited movement, but the weatherimproved sufficiently on the following day to permit of normal patrol activitiesbeing resumed. Increased movement of enemy M.T. was observed between Tmimiand Mekili and in the area of Eluet-el-Aggara.Burma.Irrawaddy Front.25. During the night the 15th/16th our right flank withdrew to the line ofthe Kadaung Chaung, 17 miles south of Yenangyaung, where demolitions in the oilfields have been successfully carried out.Following infiltration owing to the wide front, the enemy established roadblocks north and south of the Pin Chaung in the rear of our forward troops.After combined attacks from the south and from the north by our armoured forces supported by Chinese reinforcements, the enemy were cleared from this area early on the 19th. By nightfall our forces had crossed the Pin Chaung andare now east of Kyaukpadaung.   The Chinese still hold Yenangyaung.There has been only slight enemy pressure at Taungdwingyi, where our positions have been maintained, protecting the Chinese right flank.Sittang Front.26. After severe fighting at Thagaya, the Chinese withdrew on the 16th tothe area of Pyinmana. They have since been in action further north atKyidaunggan against the enemy, who had worked round to their rear.Karenni Front.27. The Chinese still hold Loikaw. but enemy forces, possibly those previously reported at Yado, crossed the Balu Chaung at Mongpai and Pekonand attacked 7 miles north of Loikaw, where fierce fighting is taking place. Inthe Karenni area it is estimated the enemy number 3,000 with 300 vehicles,including A.F.Vs.South-West Pacific Area.28. General MacArthur has assumed his appointment as Commander-in-Chief, South-West Pacific. From midnight, the 18th April, all operationalsections of the Australian Defence Forces were assigned to General MacArthur&apos;command. The following names of the Commanders of the Allied forces in theSouth-West Pacific Area have been published : Commander-in-Chief,  South-West  Pacific:   General  D.  MacArthur(American Army).Commander-in-Chief, Land Forces : General Sir T. Blarney (AustralianImperial Forces).Commander-in-Chief, Air Forces:  General G. H.

It is reliably reported that Allied guerillas are operating west of Dilli(Portuguese Timor).On the 17th April, Tanah Merah (Dutch New Guinea) was believed to bestill in Dutch hands.Solomon Islands Area.30.   The Japanese strength in New Ireland is estimated at 200.It is reported that the Japanese occupied Buin (Bougainville Island) on the5th April.

Pacific Islands.31.   On the 31st March, the American Forces at Vila (New Hebrides)totalled 1,700 all ranks, including 200 American Air Force personnel.Hawaii has been reinforced by a division.AIR SITUATION.General Review.32. Lancasters of Bomber Command carried out a successful daylight attack on a factory at Augsburg.Enemy attacks on Malta were on a heavy scale.United Kingdom.33.   Fighter Command flew 3,415 sorties by day and 334 by night.On four days during the week the enemy carried out daylight raids with small formations of single-engined fighters along the south coast. Bombs were dropped at scattered points, but little damage was done.Enemy bombers flew overland in some strength on three nights and bombs were dropped over widely distributed areas.Germany and Occupied. Territory.Day.34. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 1,793 and 54 sorties respectively.On the 17th, a highly successful attack was carried out by Lancasters on theM.A.N. (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Nurnberg) Avorks at Augsburg. This is thelargest Diesel engine factory in Germany and produces half the total require-ments for large submarines, as well as engines for warships, tanks and lorries.Of the twelve Lancasters despatched, four were shot down over Sens, on the out-ward journey, by enemy fighters. The remaining eight aircraft reached theirtarget and, attacking from about 300 feet, dropped 32 1,000 lb. delay actionbombs. Some crews reported seeing explosions and flames in the target area.Three aircraft were shot down, over the target, by flak, the remaining fivereturning safely, having completed a journey of about 1,250 miles, mostly overenemy or enemy-occupied territory.On the same day, and partly as a diversion to the Lancasters, fighter command despatched 653 aircraft over Northern France. This is the largest number of fighters so far despatched on offensive operations on one day. Themajority of these aircraft escorted Bostons and Hurricane Bombers in their attacks on land targets. The bombers obtained hits on a shell factory at Marquise;on the docks at Cherbourg; and on a Power Station, fuel cisterns and a 300-footmerchant vessel at Grand Quevilly (Rouen). Of the 44 bombers despatched onthese operations, one Boston is missing. Fifteen squadrons of Spitfires were engaged in two sweeps over the Cherbourg Peninsula and the Pas de Calais, but very little opposition was encountered. During the day&apos;s operations, our fighters destroyed three enemy fighters, probably destroyed one and damaged three for theloss of two Spitfires, the pilot of one being safe.35. Other targets attacked during the week by Bostons and HurricaneBombers included the railway sidings at Dunkirk; Maupertus aerodrome; andthe Power Station at Havre. In addition, a number of sweeps, which involved46 squadrons of fighters, were carried out, but few enemy aircraft were seen, andthose showed little desire to come to close quarters.Night.36. Adverse weather was responsible for a large reduction in the effort by bomber Command against land targets, and only 330 sorties were despatchedcompared with 1,020 sorties last week. A total of 245 tons of H.E. (including16 4,000 lbs.) and 40,535 incendiaries was dropped.The only heavy attack carried out was on Hamburg, where 179 tons of HE.and incendiaries were dropped.   Searchlight glare and intense flak hampered the
observation of results, but bursts were seen in the centre of the town, amongst the docks, and on the south bank of the river. Three 4,O00-lb. bombs were seen to fallin the old town.About 100 tons of H.E. and incendiaries were dropped on Cologne, but thickcloud and industrial haze obscured the target. Some bursts were observed,however, and many fires were seen.Small-scale attacks were made on the docks at Lorient, Havre and St. Nazaire.From the above operations, twelve bombers are missing.37. Fighter Command despatched 28 aircraft to patrol and attackaerodromes in France and Holland. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed, and fires were started at the aerodromes at Haamstede and Gilze Rijen. Bombs were also dropped at Eindhoven, Beaumont Le Roger, Nantes, Berck and Evreux.Coastal Operations.38. Coastal Command flew 513 sorties, of which 76 were on convoy escort.Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 948 sorties.39. Bomber Command despatched a total of 145 aircraft, compared with84 last week, to lay sea mines; 253 mines were laid.Five aircraft engaged on these operations are missing.40. A number of enemy vessels were attacked either with bombs or depth charges, but no definite results were observed. Beaufighters of Coastal Commandoperating off the Norwegian Coast attacked with cannon fire about twelve vesselsranging between 500 and 7,500 tons, and in most cases numerous hits were reported.   A Spitfire damaged a small torpedo boat off Dunkirk.41. About 66 enemy aircraft carried out shipping and weather reconnais-sances off our Coasts.A Ju. 88 was destroyed by two Spitfires off Harwich.Mediterranean.Libya and Egypt.42. During the first half of the week operations were curtailed by bad weather and sandstorms. On the 20th normal activity was resumed and a total of nearly 200 sorties were flown by our fighters. Escort was provided for Bostons inan attack on dispersed M.T. near Segnali, offensive patrols were carried out overthe forward areas, and large shipping and convoy patrols were provided. Verylittle enemy opposition was encountered. One Me. 109 was shot down. Some ofour fighters carried out low-flying attacks against an Italian camp and otherground targets.A surprise attack was made by 68 Me. 109s on four Hurricanes betweenEl Adem and Tobruk. Two of the Hurricanes were shot down and the other two were forced to land, but all the pilots are safe.43. Two night attacks were made on the quays at Benghazi and during oneof these raids mines were laid in the harbour. One heavy A.A. battery wassilenced and bursts were observed on the moles.Sea Communications.44. On the 14th (as recorded in paragraph 56 of last week&apos;s Resume)Beauforts attacked an enemy convoy off Malta. It is now claimed that a10,000-ton merchant vessel was hit by two torpedoes, and another of 12,000 tons was believed to have been hit.Malta.45. Heavy enemy attacks on Malta continued, but, owing to unfavourable weather conditions prevailing&quot;over Sicily during the first two days of the week,the Island enjoyed a short spell of comparative quiet.   *Thereafter the scale of attack was considerably heavier than that of theprevious week, amounting on average to approximately 190 bomber sorties each day.
Night operations were on a small scale and Italian aircraft co-operated with the German Air Force in these undertakings.Enemy attacks were again concentrated on RAP. stations at Hal Far, Luqa,Takali and Kalafrana, where considerable damage was caused to buildings,depots and barracks, and to aircraft on the ground. Installations at GrandHarbour suffered damage and a considerable amount of civilian property was destroyed.46. On the 20th April a reinforcement of 47 Spitfires reached Malta. Someof these aircraft were in action against the enemy within three hours of their arrival.During attacks on the Island our fighters destroyed 16 aircraft, probably destroyed 10 and damaged 27. Anti-aircraft guns destroyed 26, probably destroyed 6 and damaged 19. This is a total battle casualties, destroyed and damaged, of 104 enemy aircraft.47. Although our losses in combat were only four Spitfires (two pilots were saved) and two Hurricanes, five other Spitfires crash-landed (pilots safe) and atleast 12 were damaged in combat; on the ground eight Spitfires and threeHurricanes were destroyed and 25 others were damaged. This amounts to a totalof 22 fighter aircraft destroyed and at least 37 damaged.Sicily.48. In daylight reconnaissances were made of Messina, Palermo, Biscariand of the Sicilian aerodromes.Wellingtons operating from Malta made two small-scale night attacks on the aerodrome at Comiso; during one of these three Wellingtons each flew threesorties.Russia.49. No information has been received regarding air operations in Russiaduring the week.Andaman Islands.50. Two Hudsons operating from India attacked 12 flying boats in PortBlair Harbour. Two of the enemy aircraft were destroyed, and three were severely damaged.Burma.51. Blenheims carried out attacks on Magwe, Sinbaungwe, Allanmyo(twice), and on troops and transport north of Sainggya. American aircraftbombed the dock area of Rangoon.52. Enemy aircraft raided Namsang (twice). Akyab, Heho (twice),Pyinmana and Yamethin, but no damage is reported. A heavy air attack wasmade on our troops in the Yenangyaung area. Tomahawks of the A.V.G.destroyed four enemy aircraft during the week.Pacific Zone.53. A number of successful attacks were made by Allied aircraft. AtRabaul, two vessels were hit, and wharves and buildings were damaged. enemy fighters intercepted, one was destroyed and another probably destroyed. large fires were started on the aerodrome at Lakunai, and a direct hit was made on f our fighters on the ground, other aircraft on the ground were damaged.Five aircraft attacked Salamoa aerodrome and scored hits on buildings and fuel dumps; one hangar was wrecked.Koepang aerodrome was attacked twice and bombs were seen to hit the runway. At Stockholm Plantation, an enemy patrol headquarters was bombed,one large building was demolished and another damaged.54. Seven Miles aerodrome (Port Moresby) was attacked by five enemy bombers escorted by seven fighters.  Tomahawks intercepted and shot down three
of the fighters and damaged others. On the following day, a formation of 50enemy fighters approached Port Moresby but was.intercepted. One enemy fighterwas probably destroyed and another was damaged for the loss of one,allied aircraft- Later in the week, nine heavy bombers, escorted by eight fighters,attacked Port Moresby, causing no damage;. Our fighters were airbprne and damaged five enemy fighters.Cape Nelson was bombed by two enemy aircraft.The Attack on Malta.55. The magnificent defence which Malta has put up during the past threemonths has absorbed an important part of the German Air Force effort: (a) By occupying a force of 300-400 aircraft during the greater part of thisperiod which might otherwise have been engaged on the Russian frontor against this country or elsewhere.(&amp;) By causing wastage to the German Air Force in long-range bombers,dive bombers and fighters together with experienced crews.(c) It is estimated that since the 1st January, 1942, up&apos;to the present time,228 German aircraft, of which 104 are Ju. 88s, have been destroyedover Malta. Of these losses 158, including 78 Ju. 88s, have been incurred since the period of intensive raids began on the 21st March.Non-battle and flying accident losses are not counted in thesefigures.The scale of attack against Malta is the most concentrated and sustained inthe history of aerial warfare.The average effort of 200 sorties per 24 hours during the early part of Aprilfollowing the 100 sorties averaged during March shows that the utmost is beingextracted from the force available. To achieve this effort two sorties a day by aircraft must be common, and a third sortie, particularly by fighters and divebombers, by no means rare. These intensive operations over a confined area inwhich defences are highly concentrated must be producing a high wastage apartfrom aircraft destroyed. There are good grounds for thinking that the numberof aircraft lost to the enemy is higher than Malta&apos;s claims. Certainly it can besaid that, with the resumption of full-scale operations in all theatres, Malta&apos;contribution to the limitation of Germany&apos;s air power will be felt by the german air Force for a long time.Propaganda Leaflets.56. During March 1942 the number of leaflets released by the R.A.F.amounted to 19,268,725, which closely approaches the record established inMarch 1940. The leaflets were disseminated over Germany, France, Norway,Holland and Belgium. One special leaflet explained to the French people why it had been necessary to bomb the Renault works, and contained excellentreproductions of air photographs showing the damage inflicted on the works.Over 2 million of these Avere distributed over Paris and the industrial areas ofFrance.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.57. Although considerably more bombs were dropped than of late, most ofthem fell in open country well outside the major town areas. Casualties werecomparatively light, and nowhere was damage serious.By Day.58. Worth Matravers, Dorset, was ineffectively machine-gunned on the16th, making the third daylight attack on this target within a fortnight. bombs were dropped on the south-west coast on the 17th; on south coast areas on the19th, and again on the 20th.. [23740] c
By Night.59.   Bombs were dropped on every night except the 20th/21st.On the 16th/ 17th a few bombs were dropped on Avonmouth Docks and southampton. Scattered bombing occurred in Hampshire. The Hampshire area was again attacked on the following night, when a Railway Goods Yardwas hit and bombs fell in Southampton and Portsmouth. On the 18th/19ththe majority of bombs fell in the Humber Region, and Grimsby Docks were hit.On the 19th/20th there were two isolated incidents near Poole Harbour. bombs were dropped on the 21st/22nd at Weymouth, and ineffectively in PortlandHarbour.   On the 22nd /23rd bombs fell harmlessly near Wareham, Dorset.Casualties.60. Estimated casualties for the week ending 0600 the 23rd April are33 killed and 74 seriously injured.

Five buildings in the works have been destroyed or seriously damaged.The Ruhr. The Ruhr papers have stated that many rumours are spreadduring the British bombing of German towns and that people exaggerate the casulties appallingly. These rumours should be suppressed immediately and itis every citizen&apos;s duty to refrain from spreading them. A favourite rumour isthe lack of energy displayed by the relief organisations and the Party whichcauses people imprisoned in cellars to die unnecessarily.The population in the Ruhr is stated to be very uneasy. There is a markeddesire to move outside towns but it is forbidden for workpeople to move morethan ten kilometres from the towns in which they are employed.The German Press has announced the names of 64 persons killed in the raidon Cologne on the night of 13th/14th March. This is a high figure for theGermans to announce.Occupied France.Paris: Renault Works. The following account has been given of the damage caused : One-third of the factory is definitely out of action, one-third is sodamaged that it will be four months before it can be used again, one-sixth isundamaged and the remaining sixth has been so damaged by shock that it willbe two to three months before it can be used again.
