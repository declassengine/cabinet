Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out on an extensive scale off Norway, in the Baltic, off the GermanNorth Sea coast and in the Biscay area.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.12. Except on possibly one night off the Humber, there has been no mine-laying by enemy aircraft during the week.E-boats have laid mines in the Smith&apos;s Knoll area and to the east of the WarChannel in the Lowestoft to Southwold area,Thirty magnetic, two acoustic and twenty-five moored mines have been destroyed during the week; nearly all of them were off the East coast. The minetotals are 2,056 magnetic, 1.271 acoustic and 1,273 moored.Foreign Waters.The enemy have laid mines off Port Said, and also to the southward of CapeAgulhas (South Africa), the latter probably by a merchant Taider.vichy Merchant Shipping.13. During the months of March and April 37 vessels are known to havesailed from France to North Africa with part cargoes of war material, especiallymotor transport.   Deliveries have continued during the present month.. There have recently been indications that more French ships have beenrequisitioned by the enemy.Since the occupation of Diego Suarez by our forces only one ocean-going ship,the Greek Yiannis (4,391 tons), remains in Madagascar under Vichy control.MILITARY SITUATION.(An. outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Finland.14. The Russian force which on the 28th April landed in Motovski Bay,west of the German positions, has had to withdraw from the northern side of theRiver Litsa with heavy losses.Ukraine.15. The wide Russian offensive against Kharkov initially met with considerable success, but has now probably been slowed down by German counter-attacks. It is impossible as yet to say exactly how far the Russians have advanced.The Germans now appear to have launched an attack against the south of theDonets Salient, towards Isyum, but it is still too early to say on what scale or with what success.Crimea.16. The German offensive in the Crimea has been successful and it isdoubtful whether the Russians are still holding the eastern extremity of theKerch Peninsula.
Summary.17. There are still no indications that the major German offensive is likelyto begin before early or even mid-June, nor is it possible to assess to what extent the Russian offensive may have compelled the Germans to alter their plans.Libya.18. Throughout the week the enemy continued to use small groups of tanksin the forward area. Behind his forward positions considerable movement hasbeen observed. His main tank concentration appears to be in the area of el Cheima.North-East India.19.   The Assam border has been reinforced.Burma.British Front.20. The withdrawal of our forces has continued according to plan, and allformations are now in the Tamu-Palel area.The Japanese occupied Kalewa on the 14th May. A small number of rivercraft were seen moving up the Chindwin River four miles south of Sittaung aboutthe 16th.   There has been no contact with our troops.Chinese Front.21. The Japanese captured Tengyueh (north-west of Lungling) on the 15thMay, but an enemy column, advancing in this area on the west bank of theSalween, has been driven back to the Burma Road suffering considerable loss. Themain Chinese forces are in the area Paoshan covering the Burma Road. fighting in various parts continues.Part of the Chinese forces in the Katha area are gradually falling back tothe north on the line Maingkwan-Fort Hertz. Other Chinese forces are atKengtung and Loikaw, withdrawing eastwards.There are indications that the Japanese have occupied Fort Hertz.Intelligence.Scandiwavia.22. Tank landing craft previously reported as having moved from theLow Countries to North German ports have now moved northwards toScandinavian waters. There are indications that they are intended for operations, not against the United Kingdom or Iceland (C), but against Russia.There is further evidence of troop movements to the Kirkenes and Petsamoareas. The total number of German divisions remains at eight in Norway andtwo in Denmark.AIR SITUATION.General.23. Our bombers carried out extensive sea-mining operations and made a heavy attack on Mannheim.Enemy bombing attacks on Malta were on a small scale.United Kingdom.24.   Fighter Command flew 2,771 sorties by day and 210 by night.oEnemy activity in-daylight was on a small scale, but formations of single-engined fighters carrying bombs continued their raids on a number of localitieson the South Coast.At night enemy operations overland were confined to one attack on Hull andthe vicinity, when approximately 50 aircraft were employed.Seven raiders were destroyed during the week, one was probably destroyed and five others damaged.[23847] . b 2
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.25. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 491 and 12 sorties respec-tively, compared with 1,189 and 34 last week. This reduction in effort was dueto adverse weather.Only two bombing operations were carried out. Twelve Bostons, with fighter escort, carried out a successful attack on Boulogne. Photographs taken duringthe operation revealed a concentration of bombs in the wet dock area, and at leastfive bursts on the quay joining the Gare Maritime to the town station.Six Hurricane bombers, also with fighter escort, dropped bombs on or near the railway at St. Omer. One Hurricane crashed in the sea after being hit byA. A. fire, but the pilot was rescued.The fighter escorts to these two operations destroyed six enemy fighters,probably destroyed eight and damaged nine. Ten Spitfires are missing but the pilots of two are safe.A number of small-scale harassing attacks by Spitfires and, on one occasion,by four Mustangs, resulted in hits on barges, lock gates, rolling-stock, a factory,two gasometers, gun posts and other small objectives.As a result of ten sweeps, which involved a total of 35 squadrons ofSpitfires, 7 enemy fighters were destroyed, 2 were probably destroyed and- afurther 5 wrere damaged.  Two Spitfires were lost.Night.26. Weather continued to be unfavourable for operations against objectives in Germany. Only one large-scale attack was carried out, for which the targetwas Mannheim. About 74 tons of H.E. (including 37 4,000-lb. bombs) and213 tons of incendiaries were dropped in the target area and many large fires were reported, but heavy ground haze and searchlight dazzle hindered accurateobservation of results.  From this operation eleven bombers are missing.On the same night 77 tons of HE. wrere dropped on St. Nazaire. Visibilitywras good and many bursts and fires were seen in the Dock area.A total of nine Bostons and three Hurricanes patrolled aerodromes in holland and northern France.

Eleven aircraft are missing.Two forces wrere despatched to attack the Prinz Eugen, which had been sighted steaming to the Southward off the Norwegian coast. The first force was unable to locate the cruiser, but part of the second force, which consisted of 52aircraft, including 27 torpedo-carrying Beauforts, carried out an attack. two possible hits with torpedoes are claimed. Considerable enemy fighter opposition was encountered and nine of our aircraft failed to return. Five enemy fighters were destroyed. The Prinz Eugen has since been identified by photographic reconnaissance as having arrived at Kiel.A successful attack was carried out by Hudsons on two convoys off Texel andTerschelling respectively. Three ships (one of 4,500 and two of 2,500 tons) were hit and left burning and seven others of between 2,000 and 6,000 tons were hit.Of the 18 Hudsons despatched, five are missing.Another Hudson made five hits on a 350 ft. camouflaged vessel near Molde.A large cloud of smoke was seen issuing from the bows.Spitfires and Hurricane Bombers made a number of attacks on small cra t, asa result of which a minesweeper, a barge and a launch were sunk and other vessels damaged.Enemy air activity off our coasts was again on a small scale, consistingmainly of shipping and weather reconnaissances. No attacks on our coastal shipping have been reported. Three aircraft were destroyed by our fighters and a further five were damaged.
Mediterranean.Libya and Egypt.28. Routine operations continued throughout the week, although ait-activity was somewhat restricted by sandstorms. Fighters carried out offensive patrols, reconnaissances over the forward area and provided protection for shipping. Kittyhawks carrying bombs attacked enemy camps, hitting buildings and tents.Bombers made two small-scale night raids on Benghazi and a daylight attackon shipping in the harbour. Heavy cloud prevented observation of results, butbombs were seen to fall in the inner harbour area.Malta.29. Enemy bomber operations against the Island fell to a negligible scale.On an average only about five long-range bomber sorties were made by day and by night, and of these some aircraft were only on reconnaissance. The rest of theenemy&apos;s effort was an average of about 80 single-engine fighter sorties by clay,some of which carried bombs. These aircraft attacked the Island and acted asescort to bombers, but little damage resulted.Our fighters shot down 29 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 11 others and damaged a further 22. Anti-aircraft guns destroyed one and damaged five. Ofthis total of 68 enemy aircraft, 41 were German and 27 Italian. Four of our fighters were lost and three others crash-landed, but two pilots are safe.On the 18th a reinforcement of 17 Spitfires reached Malta.Sea Communications.      ,30. A Wellington and three Albacores attacked a medium-sized vesselescorted by three destroyers west-north-west of Tripoli.
