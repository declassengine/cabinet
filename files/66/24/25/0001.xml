BRIDGES.Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great- George Street,. S0W.I0 9Telegram No. CC/56, dated 6th May, 1942*Following Most Secret and Personal for Chiefs ofStaff from.Commanders in Chief, Mediterranean and middle Eastolo Following is our appreciation of possibilitiesof launching offensive in Western Desert.2r; Enemy tank formations are now believed to be nearly up to establishment and should be able toproduce on the battlefield by 1 June 360 German and160 Italian Tanks,30 A forecast of enemy tank reinforcements during may and June is 80 to 100 German of which majorityseem likely to arrive May0     Unless change occursin establishment of armoured divisions and/or a tankBattalion is included in establishment of 90 LightDiVo these tanks may be regarded as reserve orreinforcement tanks,,     Italian strength if LittorioDivision is completed may rise by another 156 Tanks.All above figures exclude self propelled guns.

4* Our strengths with formations ready for &quot;battleexcluding infantry tanks are likely to he 460 by 1 june and 600 by 15 June0     Reserves forward in Eighth Armyarea will probably be about 100 by 1 June and,140 by 15June but these figures may be increased depending on the arrival of convoys0      Reserves with formations not fully trained or equipped and in base workshops willbe about 330 on 1 June and about 230 on 15 June.50 We boric  to have in addition in forward areaready for battle early in June about 250 infantry tanks*These tanks can not.repeat not be relied on to influencedirectly any (?) fighting between armoured formationsbecause they are not trained to this role and lackthe necessary supporting arms and 100 are Matildas whiohlack, mobility,,      But properly handled they should be ableto make the enemy detach a number of Cruiser tanks to watch them and thus to reduce the number of tanks he canpit against our oruisers*     Moreover the enemy is unlikely to be as well off.as we are in respect of reserves of tanks&amp;6o We have hitherto considered that to have adequatesuperiority for an offensive we required two cruisertanks for every one German and parity in this respectwith the Italians^      We now consider that a superiority of three British to two German can be accepted becauseof the availability of Grant tanks and 6 pdr, A/tk gunsour superior reserves and also on account of the part which our infantry tanks should be able to play.Moreover we hope that our tank formations are trainedon sounder lines than before,,7, Assuming Littorio Division does not repeatnot materialise we shall need 160 cruiser tanks to offset160 Italian tanks and 540 Gruiser tanks to offset360 German tanks in the proportion of 3 to 2,     Thereforenoo of (?) cruiser tanks needed on battlefield is 700*Against this figure we shall have only 455 by 1 June.By 15 June we hope to- have four armoured brigade groupsready for battle which should give us about 600 cruisertankso     Other things being equal we consider that thisreduced superiority as on 15 June can be acceptedthough it necessarily decreases the chance of success and especially of quick success*3e Should Littorio Division arrive in the battlezone by June 15 we should have to postpone ouroffensive till August when we hope 10 armoured division^/will be fit to fights    There appears to be no repeatno possibility of lCr armoured division^1 being ready forbattle before end of July mainly because of shortage oftransport vehicles^90 In view of the above-, we do not repeat notconsider an offensive would be justified before 15 June.To start earlier would incur risk of only partial success and tank losses and might i n the worst case lead to aserious reverse the consequences of which in present-2-

circumstances are lively in our opinion to &quot;be extremely dangerouss10..     The other factor on which our ability to launch and sustain an offensive depends is the retentionof a reasonable superiority in the air.     If air forces have to be withdrawn from the Western Front to aidTurkey or to meet a threat on our Northern Front andthere is no corresponding reduction in enemy fighterstrength in Gyrenaica an offensive can not repeat notbe launched in Libya and if it were already inprogress would in all probability have to be called off at once.     We can not repeat not say whether or when this need to divert air forces will arise but it isnecessary to bear in mind that tank strength is notthe sole determining factor when the possibility of an offensive in Libya is being considered.T.0.0,    1650Z/6
