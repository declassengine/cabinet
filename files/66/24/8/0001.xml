THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1942.SECEET. , Copy No. 2W.P. (42) 178.)       April 26, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.POST-PROTOCOL  SUPPLIES  TO  RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.ON the 14th April the War Cabinet invited me to prepare a report setting out the maximum which this country could afford to send to Russia from thepoint of view of shipping (including convoy escorts) and of production. Theattached statement sets out the action the Americans have taken, the limits of importation into Russia and the proposals of the Departments in regard toBritish supplies.Arising out of this report, I submit certain recommendations. These aregoverned by the following premises : &apos;First. Russia will have to bear the brunt of Germany &apos;s attack in 1942.In order to keep her confidence and sustain her morale, we must supply herwith munitions to the limit of our ability To do less would increase the dangers, if there are any, of Russia&apos;s making a separate peace.Second. We are faced by the alternative of either making an implicitpromise to launch a large-scale invasion of the Continent in 1942 or of keeping up a higher rate of supply to Russia at the risk of some damage toour own programme.  The second alternative is the more politic of the two.Third. ^Supplies should be made up of the most efficient weapons whichwe produce and must arrive in time for the campaign now imminent.Fourth. Any slackening of our aid to Russia would impair the keennessof workers in this country.Fifth. The case for increasing our deliveries of tanks is stronger thanthat for increasing our deliveries of aircraft. Tanks cannot be employedagainst the enemy except by an invasion of the Continent, with all itsattendant hazards.   Aircraft can.&apos; 1. Convoy Limits.f , The Americans should be informed that the Naval Staff do not.expect to be able to sail more than three convoys in two months to russian Northern ports, and consider that these convoys should belimited to 25 ships each.2. Basis of Planning.But as the convoy situation may change before the middle of 1943,the joint programme should be planned on the basis of an import of,say, 4 million short tons.[23746] b
3. Loading. .. ,.&apos; :; : . Ships are arriving at Russia&apos;s Northern ports with little, more than half of their possible cargo. The Anglo-American supply programme should be jointly planned in such a way that the ships are fully loaded.This can be done either by bringing bulk materials and foodstuffs to britain to be transhipped and loaded with our priority cargo (aero-planes and tanks) or by supplying more of the priority cargoes from north America.4.   Tanks.Production forecasts of I Tanks (Valentines, Matildas and A.22&apos;s)for the last half of 1942 show a surplus over requirements for BritishEmpire Forces, Dominions and Home Defence and Allies (unit equipmentplus full reserves 41 per cent, at&apos; home and 90 per cent, overseas) of2,290 tanks. (In addition there is a surplus for British Forces of 2,420cruisers.) The surplus of I tanks would make it possible to increasethe supply to Russia from the present rate of 1,500 per six months to] 2,250. But C.I.G.S. thinks that the figure should be limited to 1,500and the balance kept at home on the grounds that if a Continentaloperation became necessary either at the end of this year or early next*   year, a large additional reserve of Valentines would be essential.Having regard to the table of tank production, allotments, &amp;c, in annex IV, I suggest that we can well spare an extra 750 tanks.The Americans will make their 50 per cent, increase within the halfyear, but not fully until the later months. An attempt should be madeby joint discussion with the United States authorities to secure an adjustment of the time-table of assignments so that the larger proportionof the tanks to be shipped in the last half of the year are sent beforeArchangel is closed.In the first half of 1943, the combined output of United States,United Kingdom and Canada is likely to exceed 36,000 tanks. It shouldbe possible to provide out of this production the 1,000 tanks a monthasked for by Russia.5.   Aircraft.The Air Ministry do not see their way to fulfil the Protocol obliga-tions in May and June, but suggest sending ldO fighters (Hurricanes,Typhoons and Airacobras) in May and 130 in June instead of 200 in each month. Their reasons are that more Hurricanes must be sent to India andthe Middle East at a time when Hurricane output is falling; that Aira-cobras are limited by the numbers received from the United States andthat, owing to technical troubles with the Sabre engine, output ofTyphoons (which they regard as the, other most suitable type to send toRussia) will be very small.For the second half of 1942, the Air Ministry propose to maintainthe figure of 200 a month in spite of the conditional promise to increasethe present figures by 50 per cent, during that period. The types will bethe same; the number of Hurricanes will be partially restored and thebalance made good by a growing number of Typhoons and a substantialsupply of Airacobras.No proposal is made about 1943.On broad political and strategical grounds, however, I consider thatit is a mistake either to send less than the full Protocol quota for Mayand June or to send to Russia planes such as the Typhoon which have     not yet been proved.   I recommend ^(a) that the allocation of aircraft for May and June should be suchas to live up to the Protocol requirements,(b) that the Air Minister should be asked to revise the list of types  for the following six months and reconsider thenumbers.I agree that no firm promise should be made for 1943 until we candiscern the strategical and tactical position more clearly.
Other British Supplies.The Americans should be notified that we can supply the other articles enumerated in paragraph 14 (iii) to (v) and Annex VI of thereport. .Procedure.We should concur with the American proposal to make a joint statement to the Russians indicating the supplies that can be furnishedand inviting them to discuss in Washington a specific supply programmebased upon shipping possibilities.This step should be preceded by an Anglo-American discussion ofthe offer. The discussion would deal with food supplies as well asraw materials and munitions and with the vital problem of the jointregulation and co-ordination of shipments to Russia from all sources.[23746] b 2
REPORT ON POST-PROTOCOL SUPPLIES TO RUSSIA.* United States Action.1. President Roosevelt recently issued an instruction to prepare an offer of post-Protocol supplies for Russia on the assumption that &quot; aid to Russia be continued and expanded to the maximum extent possible consistent with shipping possibilities and the vital needs ofthe United States, the British Commonwealth of Nations and others of the United Nations.&quot;2. The Russians were also invited to state their requirements from theUnited States. They have asked for a 50 per cent, increase in tanks and aeroplanesin the second half of 1942 and a 100 per cent, increase in 1943 together with a variety of Army material, some of which was not included in the Protocol, andfor very large quantities of food, materials and industrial equipment. these requirements amount to 10^ million short tons (see Annex I).3. On the basis of these requirements, the American Departments have drawn up a statement of supply possibilities which it is proposed to submit tothe Russians together with a statement of possible supplies from this country.The possible American supplies total 8^ million short tons.4. The Americans, however, recognise that these figures are far in excessof Russia&apos;s import capacity, which they estimate at 3 million tons through thenorthern ports and 1 million tons through the Persian Gulf. Allowing 10 percent, for losses, this would justify the shipment of 4-4 million tons from all sources.Import Possibilities.5. The American estimate of import capacity is based upon the possibilityof inland clearance and can only be attained if the northern railway works at full capacity all the year round. This means that large surpluses would have tobe stored at Archangel in the summer to be moved south during the winter. it also assumes the double tracking of the railway which serves both Archangel and murmansk from Oberzeskaya southward to handle fifteen trains of 600 tonscapacity daily each way. /On these assumptions, the Ministry of War Transport do not dissentsubstantially from the American figures of maximum port and rail capacity(see Annex II).6. These estimates represent an average of 350,000 tons a month. But thisis an average of winter and summer rates. In the past 6 months importationhas been limited to the 90,000 tons port capacity of Murmansk plus the 20,000 or so tons available for-Russia via the Persian Gulf.7. Even these winter figures have not been fully tested by experience. the protocol calls for the equivalent of 200,000 short tons a month (apart from food),of which about 50,000 tons are to be provided from the United Kingdom and150,000 tons from the United States. Allowing 30,000 short tons for the persian gulf, this leaves 170,000 tons to be brought through the northern ports.In fact, during the six months October-March the total arrivals through thenorthern ports were approximately equivalent to 340,000 short tons an averageof 57,000 tons a month -while the highest figure (March) yet attained onlyamounted to 80,000 short tons (see Annex II).8. The lowness of these figures is due in part to the fact that fewer ships have arrived from America from, which most of the bulk cargo would be shipped than the number that have arrived from Great Britain. Also it hasbeen essential during the past winter to make prompt shipments without waiting
to plan ideal loading combinations. In both cases, therefore, the loads carriedhave been far below normal capacity the average load of the British ships beingabout 2,800 short tons and of the American ships 3,800 short tons. The calculation of the Americans quoted in paragraph 4 above is based on the assumption that ships will carry on the average 6,000 short tons.This small load factor is responsible for the fact that in March 28 ships were required to carry 40 per cent, of the Protocol requirements. On this basisat least 60 ships a month would be needed to fulfil the present Protocol.9. The programme must, however, be planned on a much less extravagantuse of ships; for we cannot count upon the arrival of 60 ships a month.The attached note of the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff, which has been approvedby the First Lord (see Annex III), states that the Admiralty do not expect tobe able to sail more than three convoys in each two months, and that the size ofthe convoys would be limited to 25 ships. This means that, at the present time,the limiting factor governing supplies to Russia is that of convoys and the cargoesthat can be carried in 75 ships in each two months, less losses.If this rate&apos; continues throughout the year, importation through thenorthern ports will be not more than 2f million short tons less losses, assumingaverage loading, of 6,000 tons a ship, or about 1^ million short tons if loadings areno better than the average of the last 6 months.10. These facts emphasise the importance of the most careful planning ofthe shipping programme if the largest possible amount of cargo is to be carried in every ship that is convoyed through the northern danger zone.But, if ships can be fully loaded to the American standard, the limitedsailings indicated in the Admiralty note would suffice, after taking account of persian Gulf imports, to carry 50 per cent, more than the present Protocolrequirements and would occupy about 90 per cent, of the theoretical port andclearing capacity of Russia&apos;s northern ports.British Supplies and Import Capacity.11. The preceding statements have a bearing on the total programme forwhich America should make provision. They do not determine the much smallergross total which Great Britain can supply for the greater part of our ship-ments consist of priority cargo for which space can and must be found.12. No statement has been asked for or received of Russian requirements from Britain. It may be assumed, however, that the Russians will look to us tocontinue our Protocol supplies with an increase in tanks and aeroplanes of 50 percent, this year and 100 per cent, next year. The tonnage of raw material andother goods to be shipped from Britain is relatively small since most of the materials for which we have assumed responsibility will go from distant sources of supply via the Persian Gulf. There will be no difficulty in shipping thewhole of the requirements which can be supplied from the United Kingdomwithin the limit of the shipping figures indicated by the Admiralty.13. The volume of Russia&apos;s imports during the next twelve months will depend on how far other classes of cargo can be matched with priority shipments.The proper balance may be secured either by bringing bulk materials and food-stuffs to Britain to be transhipped and loaded with our tanks and aeroplanesor by supplying Russia&apos;s needs for tanks and aeroplanes from America andsending our tanks and aeroplanes to other theatres of war.Post Protocol Supplies.14. The following are the quantities of chief items that can be forthcomingon supply grounds :- -&apos;-.     &apos;:&quot;(i) Tanks - Both British and American tanks are being sent to almost everytheatre of war. The answer to Russia&apos;s request can, therefore, only be given inthe light of all the allocations that are being made.      KIn the nine months of the First Protocol period, the United States, Britainand Canada will have produced 17,000 tanks, of which 4,500 are being allotted to Russia. - -1 - &apos;&apos; &apos;: &apos; :&apos;
In the second six months of 1942, it is now estimated that the production ofthese three countries will be 19,500,* of which Russia asks for 4,500.If it is decided that this number should be sent, the number to be supplied from Great Britain depends on the balance sheet of the three types-Valentines,Matildas and A. 22&apos;s which, we are sending to Russia.In these three cases, the requirements of British Empire forces, Dominions,Home Defence and Allies will disclose a deficit on the 30th June of this year onthe basis of unit equipment plus full reserves (41 per cent, at home and 90 percent, overseas) of 1,361 tanks (see Annex IV). The forecast of; production inGreat Britain during the second half of 1942 amounts to 2,951 margin 1,590 itanks, which will only provide the present Protocol rate of 250 tanks a month.But, in addition, Canada will produce 700 Valentines. If these Canadian tanks were made available for Russia the 50 per cent, increase, i.e., 2,250 in the halfyear, could be supplied. The C.1.G.S is, however, strongly opposed to givingthese tanks to Russia on the grounds that, if a continental operation became necessary either at the end of this year or early next year, a large additionalreserve of Valentines would be essential.tThe allotment of 2,250 tanks of British type would meet the Russians&apos;request for the second half of 1942 in full, for the Americans propose to send2,250 heavy and light tanks. They do not expect, however, to send the fullquantity in the early months, but have allotted 337 a month in July, August and september and 413 a month in the following quarter. This time-table should, ifit is in any way possible, be reversed, for heavy tank shipments in the winter months will not be in time to influence this year&apos;s campaign and will arrive whentransportation difficulties are at their worst. Ships sent to Archangel can carrymore tanks than ships sent to Murmansk owing to greater crane facilities at theformer port, while the much shorter rail haul from Archangel to Moscow means that Russia&apos;s limited supply of rail flats can move many more tanks into theinterior.Such an adjustment of the time-table could only be carried out in a reviewof the whole plan of assignment in Washington. ,The situation in the first half of 1943 is not yet clear, as types will be variedin consequence of the Tank Mission. All that can be said is that the overallproduction is likely to be some 36,000 (United States, say, 28,000, Britain 7,000,Canada 1,000). It should be possible to guarantee to Russia their request forone-sixth of this figure, subject, of course, to the general proviso regarding achange in the strategic situation.(ii) Aircraft. The Protocol provided for delivery to Russia monthly of200 fighters from Britain and 100 fighters and 100 bombers from United States.The Russians have asked for a 50 per cent, increase in the second half of 1942and 100 per cent, increase in the first half of 1943.In the nine months of the first Protocol period, United States, Britain and canada will have produced some 14,300 fighter planes, excluding Fleet Air-armfighters.   Of these, 2,700 have been allotted to Russia.In the second six months of 1942, the three countries will produce some12,500 fighters, of which Russia asks for 2,700.In. the first half of 1943, the total production will be of the order of 17,000;in that period, Russia asks for 3,600. From the beginning of the Protocol,Russian demands have been of the order of 20 per cent, of the current productionof Britain, United States and Canada.No official statement has been made of America&apos;s intention, but a cable fromthe R.A.F. Delegation from Washington indicates that the Americans will not increase their allocation to Russia.The Air Ministry&apos;s statement on Britain&apos;s contribution (Annex V) does not -deal with 1943. iIn regard to 1942, it proposes (a) that in May and June our deliveries should $)be limited to 110 and 130 fighters respectively-or 240 in all instead of 400 in* The American figures included in this total are those brought home by the Tank mission and are lower than previous estimates owing to the use of large numbers, of tank chassis for self-propelled artillery. ,. , ,f C.I.G.S. has since informed me that a reorganisation of Armoured and Infantry divisions which will require the bulk of the 700 Canadian tanks is in contemplation. He adds that duringthe last few days there have been indications that sufficient shipping will not be available to export from the United States all the tanks which could be allotted to us from Americanproduction. This may well continue to be the case if large numbers of American troops haveto be transported by sea. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance not to deplete ourselvesunduly qf British-made tanks.
order that larger allocation of the types concerned may be made to India and theMiddle East, and (&amp;) during the second half of 1942, to supply nearly 200 fightersa month, i.e,, to make no increase on the first Protocol quota.This plan is based on the premise that our supplies to Russia should be limitedto three types of fighter, viz., Hurricanes, Airacobras and Typhoons, the surplusavailable for Russia in the third and fourth quarters respectively being : 3rd Qtr.      4th Qtr.Hurricanes ......      ...      300 200Typhoons.........      ...        90 150Airacobras .........       180 250570 600The Air Ministry point out that one of the main reasons for our inability to release, any more aircraft is that, by maintaining our own forces at the requiredlevel, we shall in fact be continuing to afford most important indirect support toRussia by containing no less than two-thirds of the German Fighter Force away from the Russian theatre.In the third quarter of 1942 the Air Ministry estimates that it will receiveabout one thousand Hurricanes, including an allowance for Canadian productionand for the return of repaired aircraft to squadrons. The Air Ministry estimatesits requirements for this period at 700, nearly two-thirds of which would berequired in order to maintain a monthly flow of 150 to India and the Middle East.In the fourth quarter it is assumed that Canada will claim a larger shareof her own Hurricane production.The figure for Airacobras is based on the fact that 273 of these planes arealready in this country or in transit and can be sent to Russia as soon as theyare battle-worthy. Of these, 120 are estimated to go in May and June, some 40are expected in both August and September which will complete the thirdquarters allotment, and it is hoped to make arrangements to continue the supply-in the fourth quarter. It is, however, clear that there is no margin for an increaseof supply of this plane.It is assumed that Typhoons will be available to fill the gap on a rising scale,but in the estimates they have made the Air Ministry have assumed a discount of40 per cent, on the programme forecasts and have allotted about half to Britishformations.The weakness of this scheme is the extent to which it depends on Typhoonsto make up even the limited quota of 200 a month. This aeroplane is practicallyuntried in action and takes the Sabre engine from which much technical trouble is still being experienced. It may be questioned whether it is wise to send to russia type of aeroplane whose reliability is very far from being established. I Tt wouldseem optimistic to rely on being able to send a substantial part of the output toRussia from May onwards. ; : vThe only other ways of making up the Russian quota to its present, or somehigher figure are, (a) to send some other types of fighters to Russia, (6) to sendmore Hurricanes and let the stock in this country run down-in view of the factthat the large increase in Spitfires and other types will much more&apos; thanmake good the deficiency, (c) consider in conjunction with the Americans thepossibility of meeting the original request put forward at Moscow, and sendbombers \e.g., Wellingtons or American dive-bombers) rather than fighters toRussia. *      :;! -//(iii) Other Army Supplies. The army proposes the following allotments ofsupplies included in the Protocol : 200 Bren Carriers with Weapons, per month.   This is the same rate asat present. , .50-2-pdr. and 50 6-pdr. Anti-Tank Equipments a month.   This isan increase on the present rate of supply, which amounts to 500 --2-pdr.Anti-Tank Equipments in the 9 months ending June 1942. ;300 Anti-Tank Rifles a month.   This supply started at 200 a month,rising to 300 in June.   It is proposed to continue this rate indefinitely.Though the Rifles could be supplied iii larger numbers, if our /own largedeficiencies were disregarded, the ammunition is not available in sufficient quantities to make it safe to send more of the Rifles. &apos;No motor vehicles will be sent.
(iv) Naval Supplies. -Anti-Aircraft Guns. It is hoped to allot 50 Oerlikonsa month and 10 3-inch H.A./L.A. or 12-pdr. Guns with ammunition untilrequirements are met. In the case of the 3-inch or 12-pdr. Guns, this wouldbe at the end of 1942.In addition, the Admiralty have arranged to supply 32 submarine storagebatteries, which will fall into the last half of 1942.Also 50 130-mm. complete barrels, plus one spare barrel per Gun, startingat the rate of 8 per month in August and continuing to February 1943.(v) Raw Materials. A statement attached hereto (Annex VI) shows the quantities of various raw materials which are being supplied monthly under the protocol, and the quantities which it is proposed we should supply from the1st July.   The cases in which a change is proposed are : Aluminium. 1,000 tons a month instead of 2,000 tons, or alternatively,2,000 tons a month during the second half of 1942, and nothing thereafter.These proposals are subject to the repayment by the United States ofour loan of 6,696 tons made this year. This recommendation is based onthe proposition that we ought never to allow the Ministry reserve stocks inthis country to fall below 50,000 tons. British consumption is estimated torise from the present figure of 40,000 tons a quarter, to 60,000 tons a quarter in the middle of next year. This minimum stock will therefore represent1\ months&apos; consumption at the latter date.Tin. 1,000 tons instead of 1,500 tons a month. The Russians have,already been asked -to agree to this reduction (which is in line with greatly reduced supplies in England and America), and to try to get some of their supplies from China.Lead. 3,500 instead of 7,000 tons. The Russians have not shipped theamounts available, as lead is on a lower priority than other metals.Cobalt. It is suggested that United States takes over, but this will besubject to C.R.M.B. recommendations.Rubber. An allocation must be made by the Combined Raw MaterialsBoard in Washington. It is not to be expected that a long-range alloca-tion can be made, and the Russians have been especially asked to provide information about their stocks, consumption and production.Other metals will continue as under the Protocol. In several of thesecases, for example, copper and zinc, our own position is uncertain pendingdiscussions on the Combined Raw Materials Board. Since we draw marginalsupplies from the States in these cases, there is no clear reason why we shouldcontinue to accept special responsibility for meeting Russian requirements.(vi) Foodstuffs. The Americans are prepared to send 4,000,000 tons of foodstuffs to Russia in the next twelve months. In view of this, it might seemunnecessary to include anything in the British programme. While we continueto send tanks and aircraft in large numbers, however, there is a lot of capacity for bottom cargo and broken storage, for filling which there is no suitable alterna-tive. Food should be sent from this country only as a matter of shippingconvenience.Some of the supplies for which Russia is asking (especially oils and fats andcanned meat) are internationally in short supply, and it is essential that anycommitments entered into by the United States and ourselves should be reviewedon a combined Anglo-American basis before a firm programme is submitted to theRussians.(Intel.)

ANNEX I.Russian Requirements from United States for Period July 1, 1942, toJune 30, 1943, and United States Proposals for meeting them.1. The Russian programme of requirements from United States and thevarious United States agencies&apos; recommendations of the supplies which should bemade available are : Period July 1, 1942, to June 30, 1943.Finished military equipmentRaw materials and manufacturesFood        ............Petroleum productsRequirements^[short tons).1.300,0005,000,0004,000,000240,000A vailable[short tons).1,100,0003,000,0004,000.000240,00010,540,000 8,340,000* In addition to 1st protocol items still unshipped at the 1st July.2. The Americans estimate that 3,000,000 short tons can be cleared throughthe Northern ports in the period, and 1,000,000 through Persia. The maximum practicable export from United States to Russia, assuming no supplies from united Kingdom and 10 per cent, shipping losses, is thus 4,400,000 short tons.3. The amounts which the Americans are willing to supply are thereforenearly double the maximum transport capacity. The schedules of Russianrequirements and the United States proposals have thus very little value forprotocol revision, in the absence of a Russian statement of relative priorities.It is clear, however, that there is ample bulk cargo available in United States tocomplete the loading of ships carrying priority cargo.4. The Russian requirements of tanks and aircraft oall for an increase inthe second half of 1942 of 50 per cent in the protocol rate of supply, and anincrease of 100 per cent, in the first half of 1943. The figures for these and other important Army items are as follows : Protocol monthlyrates.*United States War Departmentproposals.2nd half 1942(monthly).1st half 1943(&quot;monthly).AircraftTanks ............90-mm.

(iv) Naval Supplies. Anti-Aircraft Guns. It is hoped to allot 50 Oerlikonsa month and 10 3-inch H.A./L.A. or 12-pdr. Guns with ammunition untilrequirements are met. In the case of the 3-inch or 12-pdr. Guns, this wouldbe at the end of 1942.In addition, the Admiralty have arranged to supply 32 submarine storagebatteries, which will fall into the last half of 1942.Also 50 130-mm. complete barrels, plus one spare barrel per Gun, startingat the rate of 8 per month in August and continuing to February 1943.(v) Raw Materials. A statement attached hereto (Annex VI) shows the quantities of various raw materials which are being supplied monthly under the protocol, and the quantities Avhich it is proposed we should supply from the1st July.   The cases in which a change is proposed are :- Aluminium. 1,000 tons a month instead of 2,000 tons, or alternatively,2,000 tons a month during the second half of 1942, and nothing thereafter.These proposals are subject to the repayment by the United States ofour loan of 6,696 tons made this year. This recommendation is based onthe proposition that we ought never to allow the Ministry reserve stocks inthis country to fall below 50,000 tons. British consumption is estimated torise from the present figure of 40,000 tons a quarter, to 60,000 tons a quarter in the middle of next year. This minimum stock will therefore represent2^ months&apos; consumption at the latter date.Tin. 1,000 tons instead of 1,500 tons a month.     The Russians have.already been asked to agree to this reduction (which is in line with greatly reduced supplies in England and America), and to try to get some of their supplies from China.Lead. 3,500 instead of 7,000 tons. The Russians have not shipped theamounts available, as lead is on a lower priority than other metals.Cobalt. It is suggested that United States takes over, but this will besubject to C.R.M.B. recommendations.Rubber. An allocation must be made by the Combined Raw MaterialsBoard in Washington. It is not to be expected that a long-range alloca-tion can be made, and the Russians have been especially asked to provide information about their stocks, consumption and production.Other metals will continue as under the Protocol. In several of thesecases, for example, copper and zinc, our own position is uncertain pendingdiscussions on the Combined Raw Materials Board. Since we draw marginalsupplies from the States in these cases, there is no clear reason why we shouldcontinue to accept special responsibility for meeting Russian requirements.(vi) Foodstuffs. The Americans are prepared to send 4,000,000 tons of foodstuffs to Russia in the next twelve months. In view of this, it might seemunnecessary to include anything in the British programme. While we continueto send tanks and aircraft in large numbers, however, there is a lot of capacity for bottom cargo and broken storage, for filling which there is no suitable alterna-tive. Food should be sent from this country only as a matter of shippingconvenience.Some of the supplies for which Russia is asking (especially oils and fats andcanned meat) are internationally in short supply, and it is essential that anycommitments entered into by the United States and ourselves should be reviewedon a combined Anglo-American basis before a firm programme is submitted to theRussians.(Intd.)

ANNEX I.Russian Requirements from United States for Period July 1, 1942, toJune 30, 1943, and United States Proposals for meeting them.1. The Russian programme of requirements from United States and thevarious United States agencies&apos; recommendations of the supplies which should bemade available are : Period Jxdy 1, 1942, to June 30, 1943.Finished military equipmentRaw materials and manufacturesFood ............Petroleum productsRequirements^(short tons).1.300,0005,000,0004,000,000240,00010,540,000A vailable(short tons).1,100,0003,000,0004,000.000240,0008,340,000* In addition to 1st protocol items still unshipped at the 1st July.2. The Americans estimate that 3,000,000 short tons can be cleared throughthe Northern ports in the period, and 1,000,000 through Persia. The maximum practicable export from United States to Russia, assuming no supplies from united Kingdom and 10 per cent, shipping losses, is thus 4,400,000 short tons.3. The amounts which the Americans are willing to supply are thereforenearly double the maximum transport capacity. The schedules of Russianrequirements and the United States proposals have thus very little value forprotocol revision, in the absence of a Russian statement of relative priorities.It is clear, however, that there is ample bulk cargo available in United States tocomplete the loading of ships carrying priority cargo.4. The Russian requirements of tanks and aircraft call for an increase inthe second half of 1942 of 50 per cent in the protocol rate of supply, and anincrease of 100 per cent, in the first half of 1943. The figures for these and other important Army items are as follows : Protocol monthlyrates.*United States War Departmentproposals.2nd half 1942(monthly).1st half 1943( monthly).AircraftTanks ...........90-mm: A..A. guns  ...37-mm. and twin 20-mm.

5. The new Russian raw material requirements are in general the same orhigher than their demands from both United States and United Kingdom at the moscow Conference. No demands have been included for lead, tin, rubber, juteand other materials which are supplied exclusively by United Kingdom in the protocol. The main increases in the protocol quantities are in steel products(44,000 tons monthly to 108,000 monthly), rolled brass, aluminium and duralumin.The programme contains very substantial requirements of railway equipmentmachinery, equipment and material for the iron and steel industry and for the petroleum industry. Some indication of the magnitude of these demands is givenby the estimated value, put at $65 millions for general machinery and equipment and $180 millions for equipment for the iron and steel industry.6. The Russian food requirement programme includes 200,000 tons monthlyof wheat and flour, 70,000 tons of sugar and 52,000 tons monthly of meat, canned meat, lard, vegetable oils and soap powder. The wheat and sugar requirements are the same as those put forward at Moscow last September,7. The requirement of petroleum products is 20,000 tons monthly, the sameas the protocol level of deliveries.ANNEX II.Russians Import Capacity.1. Any estimate of port discharge capacity and inland clearance facilities is subject to a wide range of error according to (a) the proportion of aircraft, tanks, lorries and other measurement cargoto bulk goods;(b) the allowance made for increased capacity through development: thisarises particularly in the assessment of the possibilities of the Persianroute and of inland clearance from the Northern ports, which dependsprimarily upon the double-tracking of the railway serving bothArchangel and Murmansk from Oberzeskaya southward to handle anall-the-year-round average of 15 trains daily each way (about 600tons each, southwards);(c) the reliance placed upon Russian ability to discharge, clear from the quaysand store in the Archangel area until winter enough cargo to takeadvantage of rail capacity throughout the five months&apos; period whenships cannot reach the port owing to ice;(d) the fact that the railway from Murmansk is vulnerable to enemy attack.2.   The Ministry cf War Transport estimates the possibilities as follows :-Period July 1942 to June 1943.(Capacity in short tons.)Port Discharge Capacity.	Monthly Capacity.		Annual Total.	Summer.	Winter.	Murmansk (12 months) Archangel (7 months) Kotlas (5 months) ... Total Northern route Persian Gulf route (available for Eussia)       .:.

The double-tracking would, however, suffice to carry the maximum supplies which could be discharged at the ports, provided that adequate storage facilities were availablein the Archangel area. It is reported that the single-track stretch is now onlythe last 60 kilom. northwards from Oberzeskaya, and that it is expected the doubling may be completed by July 1942.4. The total monthly Northern import capacity during the period maythus be estimated at 90,000 tons in winter and 390,000 tons in summer, giving an annual total of something over 3,000,000 tons. It should be possible to get1,000,000 tons annually into Russia through the Persian Gulf.Actual Imports into Russia.In the last six months, the following supplies have arrived in Russiathrough the Northern ports : Month of Arrival.

The actual shipments during the winter have not seriously tested thetheoretical capacity of the Northern ports. In March, the most active month,arrivals totalled 82,000 short tons against a theoretical capacity of 90,000. the monthly average during the winter has been 57,000 tons, or nearly two-thirds of capacity.7. The average load of British ships was no more than 2,800 tons; thatof United States ships was 3,800 tons. These are appreciably below the levelswhich we should reasonably hope to attain : the Americans are basing their new calculations upon an average of 6,000 short tons per ship.Relation with Protocol.8. Nor has the actual volume of shipments approached the levels providedfor in the Protocol. The Protocol calls for a monthly shipment ofapproximately : &apos;   120,000 short tons of miscellaneous cargo.20,000 short tons of petroleum products.10,000 vehicles.500 tanks.400 aircraft.[23746] c 2
This is equivalent to about 200,000 short tons monthly of which about one-quarter was promised by the United Kingdom and three-quarters by theUnited States of America. There was no provision in the Protocol for shipment of food.9. The average monthly arrivals from the United Kingdom have beenslightly below 30,000 tons, and those from the United States of America alittle below the British. Taking into account shipments through the persian gulf and the time-lag between the supplies being made available in the centres of production and their arrival in the North Russian ports, the British short-fall is not substantial.&apos; But the American shipment, which should be treble theBritish by weight, has actually been less.10. Complete fulfilment of the Protocol rates of delivery should be well within the Russian import capacity, requiring no more than&apos; 2,400,000 tons ayear compared with the prospective capacity of over 4,000,000 tons.ANNEX III.Supplies to Russia.Notes by the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff on the limitations imposed by the availability of naval protection.The North Russian convoys are now threatened by :i (a) Enemy heavy ships and cruisers stationed in Norway.(b) Enemy destroyers based on North Norway.(c) German U-boats.(d) A concentration of German air striking forces based in Norway.(e) Enemy minelaying in vicinity of Northern Russian ports.2. The convoy route is restricted at present by ice conditions and is easilycovered by enemy air reconnaissance throughout its passage, and it is on information provided by this reconnaissance that the enemy&apos;s surface, submarine and air forces can strike.3. In view of the above it will now be necessary for the convoys to be covered by major units of the Home Fleet as well as being closely escorted by an anti-submarine screen.In addition an escort of adequate strength must be provided to protect the convoys against cruiser and destroyer attack during the easterly portion oftheir passage in waters where the main Home Fleet cannot operate.4. The above commitment, combined with the many other calls now beingmade on the Fleet, is so heavy that the Naval Staff do not anticipate that theywill be able to sail the Russian convoys with reasonable security more often than three convoys in two months; moreover, they consider that the size of the convoysshould be limited to 25 ships, as otherwise the number of A/S escorts required would become prohibitive.(Signed) II. R. MOORE.April 17, 1942.
ANNEX IV.Table of Tank Supplies in 1942.In the following table &apos;&apos; British Forces &apos;&apos; includes forces in the Middle East,Dominions, India and at home.&quot;I&quot; tanks include Matildas, Valentines and A. 22&apos;s.United States Cruiser tanks include light M. 3&apos;s.The deficiency of 1,361 I tanks on the 1st July is composed of. 688 A. 22&apos;s,530 Valentines and 143 Matildas.There is a deficiency of 387 Covenanters and a surplus of 476 Crusaders.The supply of tanks in the second half-year is made up as follows : A 22&apos;s...............Matildas        ...............        620Valentines      ...       ... &apos;1Canadian Valentines ......... 700Total-&quot; I &quot; Tanks............ 3,651Covenanters    ...       ...       ... 420Crusaders       ...       ... 1,660Cromwells      ...       ...       ...        -        - - - 3402,420The 65 British light cruiser tanks are the new Mk. VII&apos;s coining into produc-tion in August.The American figures are based on the provisional allotment to the Britishgroup of countries of 9,277 for the whole of 1942. This would leave a larger figurethan 4,000 to come to us in the second half of the year; but the estimate has beenreduced since the most recent forecast of production only amounts to 21,300 forthe year compared with allocations of 24,600. It is assumed that the reduction inallotments is made on a pro rat a basis to the various groups of countries.Table of Tank Supplies in 1942.	&quot; British type Tanks				U.S. Cruiser Tanks.

From this total it is suggested on page 2 that 2,250 should be supplied toRussia instead of the 1,500 proposed by the War Office.
ANNEX V.(Secret.)Aircraft For Russia.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.(A) Period April-June 1942 inclusive.1. Available fighter types for Russia are limited to the Hurricane, Typhoonand Airacobra, Our other fighter assets Spitfires, Mustangs and Kittyhawks are completely mortgaged.2. In April we are sending to Russia 197 Hurricanes and three Airacobras.We have paid the price by a serious cut in the flow of Hurricanes to India andthe Middle East. We can only continue to send 200 fighter aircraft a month toRussia if the Cabinet is prepared to run further risks in India or the middle east, or the Trade Routes or in the night defence of our ports and factories.3.   In May and June our commitments for Flurricanes are :  Per month.India and Middle East ...      ...       ...       ...      150Admiralty ...............        15Fighter and Bomber Command        ...       ...        50Training ...      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        30Total   ...............      2454. Assuming 90 per cent, fulfilment of the production schedules in theUnited Kingdom and Canada, Hurricane income, including a margin for repair,will amount to roughly 290 per month. There remain only about 45 Hurricanesa month towards the fulfilment of the Russian commitment.5. We hope to provide about 50 Airacobras for Russia in May and afurther 70 in June.6. The Typhoon is our latest fighter type and the natural successor to theHurricane. The engine now fitted to the Typhoon (the Sabre II) limits its performance above 25,000 feet and thus restricts the use of this aircraft on theWestern Front. A small number of squadrons must, however, be started inFighter Command as quickly as possible to provide a basis of practical experience with this new type. The balance of production can be made available to Russiawhere the Typhoon should be valuable, since fighter operations normally taJkeplace at a lesser height than is normal on the Western Front.7. According to the Ministry of Aircraft Production forecast 190 Typhoonsshould be produced in the period April-June, inclusive.In practice, setbacks in the production of the Sabre engine may limit output in the June quarter to a lower figure than 190 and the number available for russia may not exceed 30.8.   The outlook for the period April-June is thus : -April. May. June.Hurricanes    ......      197 45 45Typhoons      ......... 15 15Airacobras    ......          3 50 70Total      ......      200 110 130(B) Period July-September, inclusive.9. The available types are again limited to the Hurricane, Typhoon andAiracobra.10. Hurricane assets, calculated on the same basis as before, amount to1,000. Requirements for the Middle East, India and other claimants listed inparagraph 3 amount to 700.   The number available for Russia is thus 300.
H. The supply of Airacobras during the period is estimated at 180. TheTyphoon must still be considered an uncertain quantity at this stage. If thefull production scheduled were achieved it would be possible, after meeting therequirements of Fighter Command, to release sufficient Typhoons to Russia tobring the total monthly quota of all types up to 200. In practice, the number ofTyphoons available for Russia between July and September may not exceed 90* but it must be emphasised that this depends on the number of Typhoons produced.12.   The forecast for the period is accordingly : -Hurricanes ...       ...       ...      ...       ...      300Typhoons    ...       ...       ...      ...      .. .J        90Airacobras ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      180Total      .........       ...      570 or 190 per month,or if Typhoon production is achieved 200 a month.(C) Period October-December, inclusive.13. Corresponding estimates for the last quarter of the year are asfollows : Hurricanes ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 200Typhoons............... 150    !Airacobras.....       ...      ...      ...       ... 250Total      ...       ......       ...      600 or 200 per month.(D) General.14. Great changes have been felt since the original decision to despatch200 fighters monthly to Russia. The war in the Far East has imposed a newcommitment of major importance and the demand for Hurricanes is now greatly in excess of the supply. The account can only be balanced by a major cut in somedirection, and the reduction, if not imposed on the Russian quota, must fall on india and the Middle East, the Admiralty or Fighter and Bomber Commands.The Hurricane squadrons of Fighter Command are a vital part of our night air defence; no other type is at present suitable for the role they fill. The use ofHurricanes in Bomber Command (where they will be employed as fighter bombers)is necessary to offset the loss of Bostons which the Americans have taken to meet their light bomber commitment to Russia. Failing this supply of Hurricanes toBomber Command, No. 2 Group must remain at a fraction of its planned strengthwith sharp reactions on Army Co-operation&quot; and the Channel &quot; Stop.&quot;15. The only other British type which can be considered in this connexion,apart from the Typhoon, is the Spitfire. Here again we have incurred a newcommitment, as it has recently been decided that we must build up towards aflow of 150 per month of this type for the Middle East. The Spitfire is the back-bone of the air defence of this country and failure to meet the needs of fighter command would invite disaster. During the present quarter the Spitfire situation will be extremely tight, and large reserves are necessary for Fighter Commandagainst a certain contingency of which the Defence Committee are aware. Theywill certainly not be available to the full extent required. The third quarterof the year will also be one of anxiety as regards this type. Apart from theexisting commitments reference should also be made to the fact that Mr. Hopkinshas expressed a wish to equip the United States Pursuit Groups coming to thiscountry with Spitfires.  This is a commitment which we are bound to accept.16. None of the American types, apart from the Airacobra, can seriously affect the picture as regards Russia. Kittyhawks go to the Middle and Far East;the Mustang is earmarked for Army Co-operation Command; the Lightning is(temporarily at least) a failure. The rising.swell of American production cannot make itself felt until 1943.17. The requirements stated earlier in this paper are necessarily mereapproximations. The course of future operations can only dimly be seen. Largenew commitments will certainly arise. In the last few days calls for new fighter squadrons, for West Africa, Kilindini and Aden, have arisen and are being-considered.   These additions have not yet been authorised and are not included
in the stated requirements. They are, however, typical of the many new. callswhich will certainly arise.18. The objections to a cut in our contribution of fighters to Russia areclear. Equally clear are the heavy additional calls on our supply of fighters asthe result of the war in the Far East. One or other of the claimants must suffer.As an illustration of the burden at present borne by the Fighter squadrons ofthe Royal Air Force it may be mentioned that, apart from their commitmentsvis-a-vis Japan and Italy, they are facing in various theatres no less than two-thirds of the German fighter force.ANNEX VI.Raw Materials for Russia.
