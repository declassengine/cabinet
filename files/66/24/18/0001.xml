THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1942,Copy No.WAR CABINET.POLITICAL SITUATION IN NEW ZEALAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a despatch from theHigh Commissioner at Wellington reporting on the political situation in NewZealand.C. R. A.Dominions Office, May 5, 1942.Office of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom, Wellington, N.Z.My Lord, February 19, 1942.I HAVE the honour to report that Parliament reassembled on the 5thFebruary for a session of a week. The main business was an exposition bythe Prime Minister of war developments since the adjournment two monthsearlier; the consideration of a memorandum of suggestions submitted by Mr.Holland, the leader of the Opposition, for the improvement of the Dominion&apos;swar effort; and a non-controversial measure entitled the Overseas RepresentativesAct, 1942, to enable New Zealand overseas representatives to retain their seats in the Legislative Council, the House of Representatives and the ExecutiveCouncil.2. Except in the case of the last measure, the proceedings in the Houseof Representatives were secret. I understand, however, that Mr. Fraser, inhis exposition of the war situation, read out the correspondence exchanged with,the United Kingdom Government regarding the establishment and location ofthe Pacific War Council, the representation of New Zealand in the UnitedKingdom War Cabinet and the establishment of the Anzac defence area, andthat he was accorded an almost unanimous vote of confidence in the conduct ofthe Dominion&apos;s war effort. The terms of an expression of New Zealand&apos;determination to continue the struggle to the limit of her resources were quoted in the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram of the 12th February, No. 77.3. Mr. Holland&apos;s memorandum has not been made public, but I gatherthat it was not an impressive document and that its primary motive was political.Having refused last year to join the War Cabinet, Mr. Holland has felt himselffree to endeavour to keep the party ball rolling. At recent by-elections notcontested by the Government party, he delivered a series of speeches attacking the Government which elicited a personal rebuke from the Prime Minister, but little or no response from the press and public. The reception by his own supporters of his much advertised memorandum is sufficiently indicated by thenearly unanimous vote of confidence referred to above. Apai*t from Mr. Holland&apos;activities, party politics have remained in abeyance, the whole attention of theWar Cabinet, including its Opposition as well as its Government members,having been devoted to the problems arising from the new and threatening-developments in the Pacific.[23784]SECRET.W.P. (42) 188.May 5, 1942.
4. The Overseas Representatives Act corresponds to the House ofCommons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1941, except that it is nottemporary. Its immediate object is to enable Mr. Nash to retain both his seatiii the House of Representatives and his membership of the Executive Councilduring his tenure of the post of New Zealand Minister at Washington. As itextends to the post of High Commissioner it will enable Mr. Nash to betransferred to London as High Commissioner on similar terms, should this move,which as I have elsewhere reported is on the cards, be ultimately decided upon.&apos;Mr. Nash is also retaining his offices as Minister of Finance, Customs, StampDuty and Land and Income Tax. which will be administered during his absenceby other Ministers in an acting capacity as follows : Finance       ...      ...      ......   Mr. Fraser.Customs and Land and Income Tax   Mr. Nordmeyer.Stamp Duties        .........   Mr. Mason.The justification of this arrangement apparently is that he is expected to beaway from New Zealand for a comparatively short period and that it will be convenient for him to resume his responsibilities without the formalities of areshuffle of offices.5. Mr. Nash&apos;s appointment to Washington was not popular with the Labourparty, who rightly regard him as the pillar of their economic and financial policy,and view with misgivings the loss of his support to that policy in these difficulttimes. In prestige and authority he stands second in the Labour party only toMr. Fraser; and by a considerable section of the party he would be preferred as prime Minister to Mr. Fraser himself. Indeed, when Mr. Fraser, on his return from England last year, insisted on postponing a general election, contrary to theview of Mr. Nash and the majority of the party, it is probable that nothing but mr. Nash&apos;s loyalty to his chief prevented a split in the party.6. While party politics have been shelved on account of the dangers facing the Dominion, industrial friction has not disappeared. The unions haveharboured as a grievance the rejection of their application for an increase inthe rate of wages, and in the last two months their relations with the Governmenthave not been cordial. Their attitude towards proposals to economise the man-power of the country, in particular by extending the working week, is causingMr. Fraser considerable difficulty. This extension will probably prove essentialto off-set forthcoming withdrawals of men for the Forces, and for this step theconsent of the unions is almost essential. But this consent seems hardly likelyto be forthcoming without a compromise solution of the wages issue.7. Although working conditions remain much the same and civil lifeproceeds at its usual leisurely tempo, the existence of a state of war has become more noticeable in 1942. Volunteers in the Home Guard have been engagedduring week-ends in providing dug-outs and erecting barbed wire at the moreexposed beaches near centres of population. Air raid precaution work is at lastbeing tackled seriously by the local authorities, following an undertaking by theGovernment to provide two-thirds of the cost of the expenditure. Concreteshelters, tunnelling and slit trenches are being provided in the towns. Fire-batching of industrial and commercial premises has been enforced, and atAuckland tanks are to be constructed to accommodate emergency water supplies.First aid services are being built up. Provisional plans for evacuation of sectionsof the population of exposed towns have been prepared, but it is not proposed tobring them into operation in advance of strict necessity. A partial black-out is imposed at all coastal towns, and it is intended to enforce a complete black-out should circumstances recommend it.8. The outward reaction of the public to the deterioration of the situationin the Pacific has been remarkably calm. The contrast in this respect with australia seems too striking to be entirely due to the greater distance of NewZealand from the Japanese menace. An important factor has been the loyal anddignified attitude of the Government, which, I think, can be very largelyattributed to a clear conscience. Having little to contribute to the Empire war effort but man-power, and having placed themselves as regards this in anunassailable position by the adoption of conscription, the Government feel them-.selves free from reproach in the matter of their war record, and consequentlyunder no need to cover up their shortcomings by blaming other people.
9. The influence of the press has also been a steadying factor. With theexception of Truth, an emasculated edition of its unpleasant Australian name-sake and parent, New Zealand has nothing corresponding to the Sydney press.At a recent press conference in Wellington I had an opportunity to talk privatelywith most of the proprietors and editors of the leading New Zealand newspapers.Dull, but decent, conservative and colonial-minded, profoundly critical of the domestic policy of the present New Zealand Government and perhaps a generationbehind in journalistic technique, they all expressed their disgust and contemptfor the behaviour of the present Commonwealth Government and the Sydneynewspapers, and their determination to take no action likely to impair the unity of New Zealand and the welfare of the Empire at the present critical time.10. How far the attitude of the Government and the press reflects that ofthe public is difficult to estimate. Outwardly public opinion appears to besingularly phlegmatic. The underlying cause is no doubt a certain inertiaendemic in New Zealand, but an important additional factor in the present instance is a sense of impotence. New Zealand cannot by her own exertionsproduce arms for her defence and sees little scope for increasing her securityexcept by reinforcement from overseas. Throughout the whole of her history theDominion has relied with perfect confidence on the defence of the Royal Navy.At the extreme circumference of world events shocks at the centre have been onlyfaintly felt, and the stability and survival of the democracies is an article of faith so deep-seated that it has seldom been discussed and, even after the fall ofFrance, never seriously questioned. Moreover, the immense resources of theUnited States provide a comforting reassurance. Rude as was the shock of PearlHarbour, there is a wide-spread belief that America can take such losses in herstride without unduly jeopardising the command of any part of the Pacific which she may decide to defend. Another factor is a common belief that New Zealandcan offer nothing to the Japanese which would make it worth their while to mountan expedition on the scale required for a successful invasion. This has foundrecent expression in correspondence in the press, in which it has been contended that the lack of mineral resources and of foodstuffs palatable to the Japanese rule out any likelihood of a thrust against New Zealand. Finally, the lack ofauthoritative information available to the public has a sedative effect. The termsof recent warnings by New Zealand Ministers have been very indefinite; and Mr.Fraser has not qualified a statement made last November that the most likely formof attack was hit-and-run raids. It had been assumed that press reports of theproceedings of the House of Representatives would to some extent enlighten thepublic, but the official accounts of the proceedings published were terse anduninformative. Apart, therefore, from news bulletins and reports of views expressed overseas, such as Mr. Nash&apos;s confident reference on his arrival in washington to New Zealand&apos;s ability to withstand any invader, the public rsleft very much in the dark as to the extent of the danger to which this country isexposed.11. Beneath this calm surface, however, there runs an undercurrent ofuneasiness and criticism. There is no doubt that the fall of Singapore and the escape of the German battle-cruisers has had a serious effect on United Kingdomprestige here. There is immense admiration among all classes in New Zealandfor the pluck, tenacity and endurance of the ordinary men and women in theUnited Kingdom, and, because he is believed to typify these virtues, for Mr.Churchill himself. The fact, however, must be faced that there is little confidence,either in Government, in Service, or in public circles, in the competence and fore-sight of the United Kingdom higher command. This confidence received its firstshock at the time of the German invasion of Norway; it revived during the battlefor Britain and the first conquest of Cyrenaica; and since then, after furtherfluctuations corresponding with the varying fortunes of war, it has touched a record low level as the result of the misfortunes and disasters of the last fewweeks. This is the lamentable fact that forms the background to recent communications from the New Zealand Government, as indeed these communicationshave shown; and it is an important element in a movement, now only nascent.in political circles, but, I fear, likely to acquire momentum, to bring about the recallof the New Zealand Expeditionary Force.I have, &amp;c.(Signed) H. F, BATTERBEE,High Commissioner.
