THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government most SECRET. . Copy No.[N 2385/86/G]Mr. Eden to Sir A. Clark Kerr (Kuibyshev).(No. 135.)Sir. Foreign Office, May 5, 1942.WHEN the Soviet Ambassador came to see me this afternoon we consideredthe various drafts of the projected treaty. I asked the Ambassador whether he had received any reaction from his Government to the observations I had madeto him the other day.2. M. Maisky replied that he had one or two general observations to put tome about the background of the treaty. It was, he thought, important that weshould clearly understand how these matters appeared as viewed from Moscow.As it seemed to his Government, they had been fighting for sixteen monthspractically alone. By a superhuman effort they had repelled the German attack and had even passed to the offensive. They were now on the eve of further greattrials. The Soviet Government were grateful for the help we had sent them inmaterials, of war and for effort represented by our air offensive. At the sametime what they hoped for was that we should take off their shoulders the burdenof 30 to 40 divisions. Russia would then be in a position to take the offensive.Now, so far as he could gather, there was no hope of this, nor any expectation that a second front could be formed before the autumn. Therefore the Sovietpeople had once again to bear the brunt of the struggle this summer as they hadclone last year at the cost of much shedding of blood. While M. Maisky said thathe understood the difficulties that confronted us in the creation of a second front,I would understand that the fact that Russia had to bear virtually the whole burden created a measure of resentment, even bitterness, in Moscow.3. If we were unable, for whatever reason, to give Russia help on themilitary side, then it seemed more than ever desirable to help her politically.That was why his Government had hoped that we would be willing to agreeto their draft of the treaty.4. I explained to the Ambassador that it was just the background whichhe had described to me which had caused us to be anxious to sign the treaty.At the same time we had to ensure that the treaty should be a positivecontribution to the common cause, and we were in particular apprehensive atthe state of opinion in the United States on this subject. Mr. Winant, who,as he knew, was friendly to our project, had brought back a pessimistic reportof the attitude of the United States, and I hoped that his Excellency would see the American Ambassador and obtain a report at first hand.5. M. Maisky said that he thought it quite likely that American opinion would not like the treaty. But would article 4 really help us with the UnitedStates ? He thought not. I said that whether article 4 would help us muchwith American public opinion or not might&apos;be arguable, but since president roosevelt had asked for something of the kind, the insertion of such an articlewould clearly help us with the Administration and this was important to usboth.6. We then passed to an examination of the other articles of the treaty.I pointed out to the Ambassador that in article 1 he had omitted the referenceto &quot;in concert with the other States concerned.&quot; There were a number of differences between us as to the texts, but the minor ones could be disposed ofwithout difficulty. For this purpose I hoped that the Ambassador would com-municate the Russian texts of the Soviet drafts. But the major differences were so serious as to seem to cause almost insuperable difficulty in the way of reaching an agreed text. As the Ambassador was aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government weresincerely anxious for the closest collaboration with the Soviet Government, bothduring and after the war. On the other hand, I had never, either in Moscowor since, made any secret of the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government would feelthemselves bound in regard to matters of post-war settlement to act also in concert10916-342   [23770-3]
with the Government of the United States, the Dominions and our other AlliesCertain alterations that the Soviet Government had made in the British draftwould seem to imply that the Soviet Government would wish to exclude co-opera-tion with those Governments. In this connexion I drew his attention to theSoviet amendment to article 1.7. I also pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government had repeatedly declaredthat they were not prepared at this stage to commit themselves on questions affecting the peace settlement, particularly questions of frontiers, considering thatthese should be left for settlement at the end of the war. None the less, in deference to the wishes of the Soviet Government, they had ^declared themselvesready to admit the justice of the Soviet Government&apos;s point of view concerningcertain of their western frontiers. If His Majesty&apos;s Government were to embed-&quot;this in a formal treaty, they must make it quite clear that this was done withoutprejudice to their formal undertakings to Poland.8. The Ambassador asked in what respect his draft failed to meet theposition of Poland. I replied that it took no account of our treaty with Poland,and indeed appeared to be based on the assumption that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would have nothing to do with Soviet-Polish negotiations about their common frontier. The Ambassador maintained that M. Stalin had made it clear in Moscow that he felt sure that he could come to terms with General Sikorski.His draft letter only gave expression to that point of view. After some further argument, during which I once again drew M. Maisky&apos;s attention to the Polisharticle as we had drawn it, his Excellency asked whether we would be contentif the article or something like it could be put into an exchange of letters between us. I said that I did not set much store oh the position of the article in relationto the agreement, but that our undertaking to Poland must be safeguardedclearly, either in the treaty or by an exchange of letters. Eventually the ambassador said that he would communicate with his Government on this point.I made it quite clear that unless we could be met in respect of Poland, we could notbe expected to sign the treaty.9. The Ambassador then asked about the secret protocol. He reminded methat M. Stalin wished to negotiate a secret protocol covering all Europe. I hadnot been willing to do this. Now, however, his request was a most moderate one.namely, that we should agree to the negotiation of pacts of mutual assistance between Russia and Finland, and Russia and Roumania, which pacts would alsoguarantee the independence of Finland and Roumania. At the same time, theSoviet Government were willing to give their approval to a similar pact on our part with Belgium and Holland.10. I replied that, as I had explained to his Excellency before, we could not agree to a secret pact. The Ambassador then said, let it be public. I rejoinedthat we had nc desire at present to make any such proposal to Belgium and holland. Even if it were desirable to do so, this was not, in our judgment, themoment for any such event. The Ambassador contested this, but eventuallyadmitted that the matter was one for our judgment. He maintained, however,that his Government would regard it as essential that our approval of such pactsbetween Russia and Finland and Roumania should be embodied in the treaty or in some other declaration at the same time. I pointed out to the ambassador that this demand had never been made in Moscow. It was despairing to try tonegotiate with the Soviet Government when they invariably raised their price at every meeting. The Ambassador said that at our request they had waited four months for the conclusion of the agreement, and he thought it not unreasonablethat this statement should now be included, which seemed to him perfectly-harmless. I made it plain that while we would consider the proposal, I could hold out no hope that the Cabinet would be willing to agree to this fresh under-taking.II. I then asked the Ambassador whether he had anything to say to meabout the suggestion I had made to him that, at the time of the signature of thetreaty, the Soviet Government should make some declaration pointing out that under the Soviet Constitution the Baltic States would enjoy a measure of autonomy. His Excellency said that he had received no reply to this suggestion,but on being pressed undertook to refer the matter once again to his Government.12. I pointed out to the Ambassador that the terms of Article 3, whichconcerned our attitude to the Baltic States, had been considerably stiffened sincethe Moscow draft. The latter had only spoken of meeting the Soviet Government^
&quot;desire.&quot; This time the Soviet Government spoke of&apos;&quot; interest.&quot; M. Maiskymaintained that the phrase was the same as that which had been used injyi. Stalin&apos;s draft in Moscow. I said that this was not my impression, and weundertook to check up again on the matter.13. I then said that the Soviet Government had cut out our reference to theencouraging of confederation among the smaller States in Eastern Europe. HisExcellency then embarked on a long and somewhat involved explanation, theo-eneral effect of which was that, while the Soviet Government were not at allopposed to confederation, they were unwilling to declare here and now that itwas the right solution for this part of Europe. To do this would be to encourage the exiled Governments here in all sorts of political exercises, some of whichmight not be very helpful. I said this was most disappointing. Many peoplethought that we were prepared to hand over the smaller countries of Europe to soviet domination, and, if no reference were made to confederation in some termssimilar to those we suggested, I feared that the effect of the treaty would be very bad in those quarters. The Ambassador contested this and eventually undertook to see whether his Government could not at least put in again some phrase thatreferred to confederation, even though it were only as limited in form as thatwhich had been agreed to in Moscow.14. Finally, I said that the Ambassador had made no reply to my suggestionthat we should agree to give joint assurances to the Turkish Government beforesignature. His Excellency said that this matter could certainly be considered,but it was first desirable to reach agreement if we could upon the text between ourselves.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN
