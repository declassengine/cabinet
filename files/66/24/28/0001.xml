SECRET.W.P. (*2) 198.   (Revise.)May 18, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secr-ecy of this document.WAR CABINET.U.S.S.R.V Copy No.    21Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT has occurred to me that, if negotiations with the Russians on the present draft Political Treaty prove difficult, it may be best to remove the discussions on to an altogether different basis. I accordingly attach the draft of a differentTreaty, the main point of which would be to offer the Russians, in place of the recognition of their frontier claims, a post-war alliance against german aggression until such time as a world-wide system for the maintenance of peacehas been evolved. For the rest, the draft contains the non-controversial provisionsfrom both the present draft Treaties, that is to say, military co-operation duringthe war and political and economic co-operation during the reconstruction period.It will be observed that the pledge of military assistance contained inArticle III (2) is confined to the case of an attack upon either of the parties byGermany or any of her European allies. While this does not ensure to us Russianassistance in the event of our being attacked by, e.g., Japan or France, it does not seem possible to go further, since we could not undertake to give the Russiansassistance against, e.g., Poland or Turkey. Even so it commits us to assist theUnion of Socialist Soviet Republics militarily if &quot;attacked &quot; by, e.g., Finlandor Roumania. This may seem at first sight somewhat exaggerated, but to limitour undertaking to attack by Germany would arouse Soviet suspicions, and theprovision would at any rate give us Soviet assistance against Italy.The first sentence of Article III contemplates the ultimate conclusion ofgeneral arrangements to which &apos;&apos; other like-minded States,&apos;&apos; particularly, ofcourse, the United States of America, would be parties, for keeping the peace andresisting aggression anywhere, and not only in Europe. The second sentenceprovides that pending the adoption of. such arrangements the two parties will&quot; take all the measures in their power to render impossible a repetition of aggression and violation of the peace &quot; by Germany or her European allies.Consequently, there is no undertaking in the Treaty to take any action in theevent of a violation of the peace by any other Power, e.g., Japan, and there is no obligation to take military action unless an attack is directed against-one of thetwo contracting parties. These limitations would apply (1) during the intermediate period immediately after the war before the contemplated general arrangements had come into operation; (2) in the event of their never cominginto operation at all, e.g., because the United States declined to participate. these limitations may be regarded as regrettable, but they seem to be unavoidable. we and the Soviet Union cannot undertake to police the whole of Europe, and still less the whole of the world, in the intermediate period, when this ought to be thetask of the United Nations; and still less could we undertake to do so11713   [23807]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.

permanently or even for the proposed duration (seven years) of the Treaty, ifAmerican co-operation in this task failed to materialise. These problems cannot,therefore, be dealt with in a bilateral Treaty between the Soviet Union andourselvesWith the disappearance from the Treaty of any mention of frontiers it would no longer be necessary for us to safeguard the Polish position or to insist in orderto reassure our other Allies in Eastern Europe on special stipulations aboutthe confederation of these States and about collaborating in the post-war settle-ment with the other United Nations.If M. Molotov, on arrival, proves unwilling to meet us on the above two points it will, I believe, be of little use to embark upon prolonged discussion of alternative formulae-for getting over the difficulty. On the other hand, it wouldbe highly undesirable from both the Russian standpoint and our own that his visit should end without the signature of a Treaty, which is widely expected both here and abroad. The alternative draft Treaty annexed might offer a solution in the case of such a deadlock, and, even if rejected by the Russians, it would strengthen our position to have offered it.A..
