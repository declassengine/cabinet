Fully appreciate your anxieties as regards Malta,naval strength in Home waters and Australian claims,and most difficult decisions which you have to take in these matters.      Do not feel, however, that I amkept sufficiently in picture to make forward planningeasy,      I gave some examples in my telegram, but by no means all.,2. I recognise that changes of plan are inevitable in war, but feel that forewarning might have saved mesome shocks and dangersa      It must, for instance, surelyhave been known beforehand that R repeat R classbattleships were incapable of facing Japanese fleet and I should not repeat not have been led to believethat strong n^ &apos;c was available by end of March,, copy NO.   this  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.&apos; It is requested tiiai aim-:.ml care may be taken to.tnsure the secrecy of this oocuinent.MOST SECRET.W.P.(42) 189.5th May, 1942,WAR CABINET.

n ay43* I have not repeat not been consulted onIRONCLAD, which has obvious repercussions on defenceof India, and do not repeat not know arguments for it,&quot;but should have thought that with our present weakforces, concentration was better policy than dispersion.4* As regards 5th Division W*&apos;0.- telegram 80090of 2/4 definitely gave whole Division as due India,and nothing indicated any change till 85243 wasreceived,      I have been making number moves to clearaccommodation for whole division in India, and havebased plans on its being available;     W*0*  telegram74696 of 6/5 stated that Australian Brigades wouldbe removed only &quot;when sufficient naval and air reinforcements have arrived&quot; which is certainly notyet.     I had therefore every reason to expectI should have Australian Brigades and 5th Divisionduring critical period when no fleet may be available,50 If whole of 2nd and 5th Divisions and 29thBrigade eventually reach me, I may be up to expectedstrength, hut this will not be before July,- and myexperience of commitments such as IRONCLAD is thatthey grow and absorb troops , rather than diminish.During critical months of May and June I shall bemuch weaker than expected, and events are moving veryfast in Burma. -6. Do not repeat not think it i s appreciated athome how long moves take in India, and thereforehow far ahead they have to be planned^      It has takenone month to move Brigade from Abbotabad to Assam,and move of 23rd Division of two brigades only fromRanchi to Assam will take 3 to 4 weeks,,-70 Will do our best with what you provide, butfeel it my duty to represent above*Telegram dated 5th May,- 1942*Following Personal and Secret from PrimeMinister to General Wavell.Your No. 10770/C.le, Measures will be taken forthwith to make sureyou are kept more fully informed, in future not only of what affects India directly but of whole picture.-General Ismay will assume responsibility for this.I have asked War Office for a report about the african Brigades,,-2-

2. Operation IRONCLAD is of high importance toIndia because if Japanese &quot;by-pass Ceylon and establish themselves there with French connivance asthey did in Ind.o--Ch.ina, the whole of our communications with you and M0E0 would be imperilled if not cut.There is of.course the danger- of our getting hungup there and of the place becoming a burden and nota helpo      We hope to nave minimized this risk by theuse of strong forces and severe, violent action0As soon&apos; as Do So  is taken everything will be pushedon to you as fast as possible      We hope to garrisonIRONCLAD with two African Brigades and one from theBelgian Congo or West Coast.      The two African Brigadesare already under orders and the first begins movementon June 1Q    They may just as well be in IRONCLAD as inAfricao      The 5th Division moves on at onceindependently03o        ^Long before the Japanese entered the war theAdmiralty were endeavouring to build up our naval strength in the Indian Ocean while maintaining theminimum force necessary for security in the north atlantic    The r.s. were the first ships available and were sent primarily as escorts for convoys against japanese cruiser raiders j, which were the most we hoped to have to deal witho      The damage to the U.S,Fleet at Pearl Harbour altered the situation and itwas necessary to build up a force capable of dealingwith a more powerful eruption by the Japanese.WARSPITE, INDOMITABLE and FORMIDABLE were consequentlysent to join the RQ class040 Though the concentration which was effectedat the end of March was one of considerable strength at no time did.we give any indication that itcould be looked upon as a strong fleet as it was obviously lacking in modern capital shipsD    I was quite clear myself in the situation around April 5that an engagement with the three modern Japanesebattleships and their four carriers acting togetherwould not have been to- our advantage^      It wasnoticeable however that the Japanese on their part didnot a.appear to seek an action with our forces and thisraa.y well have been due to the presence of the Ra  classbattleships which according to the Naval Staff wouldhave a definite value in a general engagement provided they had good air protection0      They certainly cannotbe ruled out as a factor in the Eastern Fleeto5o Since my last to you we have had the misfortuneto have KoG-oVo damaged by a collision with destroyerPUNJABI whoso, depth charges exploded too near the battleship,.      This makes it necessary to send her infor refit which was already overdue, and will preventDUKE OF YORK from going East0      Instead of thisAdmiralty will send the two 16&quot; NELSON and RODNEY, andVALIANT J       re^dy early in July-,.-3-.

6. Situation would be most favourably altered ifwe could damage TIRP1TZ, and Air attakcs with desperatcourage are being made upon her in Trondheim.     Whileshe is there the burden on the northern convoys toRussia is cruel upon the Fleet, and in all myexperience I have never seen the strain so great.7, I agree with you that the months of May and june must be most anxious for us in the Bast, but Ihave every hope you will get the 5th Division in Mayand the 2nd Division in June,      These at any rate arcour resolves subject to the incalculable hazards ofwar.8. For the moment the strain on Malta seems tohave lessened, and Hitler has had to shift both a fighter and Bomber Group eastward for his offensive against Russia.      He is even more strained in the Airthan we are at sea and this condition will increaserapidly month by month.-4-
