COPY.NO. ^ .. &quot;/20TH APRIL,   194-2./----&apos;--WAR CABINET,ANT I-GA3 PREGAUT IONS .Supplementary Report by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs.In accordance with the    request of the War Cabinet(W.M.   (42)  48th Conclusions,  Minute 2)  I submit a further report dealing with the points mentioned as outstanding in w.P.(42)  152nInspections of Respirators.2. Reports have not yet been received from all regionsbut those received show that in the present state of comparative indifference on the part of the public to thepossibilities of gas warfare,  there is greater difficultythan there used to be in inducing the public to takeadvantage of the opportunities for having their respiratorschecked.In many boroughs or built up areas it has been thepractice to invite the people to bring their respirators ata stated time to a convenient depot to have their respiratorstested,  and the indications are that people do not do this to the same extent as previously.      With the numerous other duties which fall upon Wardens,  it is not really practicable to have frequent house to house canvasses in heavilypopulated area so      In many areas the aim is to have a check,every quarter and it would be putting too great a strain onthe Wardens to do this in the populated areas&apos; by hoizse tohous e canvas s 0Special Warning to People Living near Chemical Factories.3. The proposal that further steps should be taken togive special warning to people living near factories wherechemicals are produced for war or industrial purposes,  inthe event of the factory being damaged and poison gasreleased, has been further examined by the Ministry of home security and the Ministry of Supply.4. On general security grounds it is obviously desirablethat the J^r. location of factories where dangerous quantities ofpoison gas are made or kept should not be publicly known.On the other hand,  the risk to people living in theimmediate neighbourhood of these factories in the event ofthe factory being damaged is so great that it is felt that additional measures for warning these people,  over and above those already in force, are necessary.      The present systemof warning the public of gas is by rattles operated by theWardens,  and it is considered that in these areas of specialrisk the warning is not sufficient nor speedy enough.

5. After close examination of the subject, particularlyin Cheshire, where some of the greatest risks exist, theMinistry of Home Security feel that a special warning shouldhe given,  e.g. by a factory whistle, which would serve as a warning to the public and would also be taken up at once bythe Wardens, who would sound their rattles.      If thisarrangement is to be effective it means that the secrecy&quot;ban would have to be lifted and that the public would&apos; haveto he told that there is a special danger, what the signalmeans, and what they should do by way of special precautions.Publicity in the Press would not he given or allowed, but thenecessary information would be disseminated by the civil defence Services.6, The Minister of Supply does not dissent from the viewthat in the interests of public safety there should be a relaxation of the secrecy ban in the neighbourhood of the factories in question (which include not only those wherepoison gas in dangerous quantities is manufactured for offensive warfare, but those where it is used for industrial purposes), but in view of the issues involved he feels thatthe matter should be specifically considered by the WarCahinetsPublic Gas Cleansing Centres.7. The Quarterly Returns now received from Regions forthe quarter ended feist March show that considerable progress has been made towards the completion of the 400 centres whichthe previous return showed as not being ready.      the deficiency has been reduced by nearly 200, which means thatthe provision made has reached about 88% of the target figure.Home Cleansing.8. The instructions to Regions for a canvass amongsthouseholders in order to secure their co-operation in taking-in contaminated strangers had been issued on 31st March.Preliminary reports already received in response to follow-upenquiries from the Ministry show that Regions are activelyworking out the arrangements for the canvass, which obviouslyneeds careful planning to secure the best results.      Theaction taken varies from Region to Region,  and includesconferences with Controllers and Medical Officers of Health,circulars to Scheme-making authorities, and discussions withthe Women&apos;s Voluntary Services,,      In some Regions, notablyEastern and South Western, much had already been done (beforethe issue of the instructions)  to publicise the importanceof home cleansing as distinguished from resort to publiccleansing centres, e.g.  through the W.V.S, Housewives Serviceand by local arrangements of the Scheme-making authorities.Arrangements with Laundries,, -9. The War Office are taking steps to expedite theproposals for the scale of charges to be made by thelaundries for the decontamination of clothing.Regions report however that the laundries can herelied upon to function if a gas attack should occur.before these financial negotiations are concluded.     With few exceptions the additional plant required has been installedand the recent arrangement with the Ministry of Labour and national Service secures the retention of the necessary labour.

^^ditional Cleansing Facilities in Factories,Sir-&quot;1 - --- --10*       Full instructions agreed jointly between the supply departments have now &quot;been issued to all factories on theirvital lists.      The Board of Inland Revenue has agreed that expenditure incurred in accordance with these instructionswill normally be regarded as an admissible deduction incomputing profits for taxation purposes.      The instructions are now being issued to sub-contractors engaged on work forthe Supply Ministries.      There are some 15,000 firms falling within this category.(Initialled)    C.R.A.Dominions Office, S. W, 120th April, 1942,
