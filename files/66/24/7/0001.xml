(42) 177.April 25, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON THE FALL OF SINGAPORE.Note by First Lord of the Admiralty.I CIRCULATE for the information of the War Cabinet a report on the fall of Singapore which was written by the late Editor of the Straits Times, Singapore,and which has been sent to the Director of Naval Intelligence.A. V. A.April 25, 1942.These notes on certain aspects of the Battle of Malaya are offered forconfidential use only. The writer of them was Editor of the Straits Times,Singapore, from 1928 until he sailed for Batavia in the early hours of the11th February, 1942. The views expressed are based on reports written for private information by two accredited War Correspondents on the staff of theStraits Times; reports by members of the staff who were up-country but succeeded in getting through to Singapore; personal experience; and sources of informa-tion which were available to the Editor of the Straits Times but may not be disclosed.Two points should be stressed. The writer was and is completely indepen-dent. He has no axe to grind, nor is he desirous of giving play to personalgrudges. Secondly, he left Singapore at very short notice, on the advice of theMilitary Authorities, and was unable to collect any papers or records. Conse-quently, none of the statements made herein can be substantiated for the timebeing.Two Reuter cables published in the Colombo newspapers during the past few days provide a convenient starting-point for these observations. One of the messages attributed to Lieutenant-General Percival a statement to the effect thatSingapore had to be surrendered owing to shortages of water, food, petrol andammunition. The second cable was to the effect that Major-General GordonBennett, commanding the A.I.F. in Malaya, had reached the conclusion by &quot; TheThursday &quot; (the 12th February) that Singapore could not hold out. I have reason to believe that Major-General Gordon Bennett took a very pessimistic viewof the situation on the 8th February; nor was he the only senior member of these vices who feared an early collapse. What was the basis of that pessimism?.The statements attributed to Lieutenant-General Percival are not acceptable.Singapore&apos;s food situation was very good. We had been told to expect a state ofsiege and had prepared for it; rationing was on a very modest scale, and as late[23749] b
as the first week in February restrictions on the sale of flour and a few other commodities were lifted and people encouraged to make purchases because stocks were too heavy. Sufficient food was available to feed people of all communitieson an extremely adequate scale for an absolute minimum of four months, and veryprobably for six months. Water had not been rationed up to the 10th February,and the Municipal Authorities were satisfied that they could carry on withoutthe Gunong Pulai supply unless a phenomenal drought occurred. This view wasshared by a former head of the Municipal Health Department, who had returnedto Singapore. There Were several reservoirs on the island, some of them close to ithe town and two, at least, in the town itself. Good water is to be found atalmost any point on the island at a depth of from 8 to 20 feet, and a large numberof people had taken the precaution of having private wells dug. Petrol rationingwas not severe and additional rations were easily available. Pulau Sambo, PulauSebrarang and Pulau Bukom the last-named possessing the largest installation of its kind in the world were stocked to capacity. These stocks weie destroyed on or after the 12th February. There were also huge oil stocks on SingaporeIsland. I am not competent to discuss the ammunition situation, but I suggest asa line of enquiry which might yield profitable results the question of dispersal.If, then, the statements attributed to Lieutenant-General Percival areunacceptable, where must we look for the real explanation of the collapse? i submit this answer : The almost complete demoralisation of the defending troops;the striking lack of any offensive spirit; the widespread acceptance of the view-that the Battle for Singapore was a forlorn hope; and, in isolated cases, an actualrefusal to fight.We have now to seek the cause of that demoralisation. First and foremost,of course, was the freedom with which the enemy was able to dive-bomb and machine-gun the troops. I have listened to tales of many men on this subject.Their experiences must have been appalling, but can such an ordeal be accepted asan adequate excuse for the lack of discipline which developed ? Many stories are current of the bad examples set by some members of the A.I.F. These troops; aswe all know, have done magnificently in offensive actions in many parts of theworld, but the very characteristics which have carried them to success in such operations appear to make them totally unsuitable for fighting on the retreat,where strict discipline is such a vital consideration. It is with great reluctancethat I pursue this question of the behaviour of some members of the A.I.F., butthere is little likelihood that these notes will be helpful if they are not frank.There were desertions. Men seen in Singapore town on the 9th and 10th Februarywere heard to boast that they had come &apos;&apos; Down the line &apos;&apos; because they were fedup with being plastered! When the s.s. Empire Star arrived at Batavia on the14th February several Australian deserters were taken ashore under armed guard.There have been allegations that men who fought valiantly in North Johore duringthe daylight hours walked back to a. nearby township at night to buy beer ! Therewere cases of looting and rape. Inche on n bin Jaafar, a member of the JohoreState Council, who has always been very outspoken, but not disloyal to the british connection, made the accusation openly at a meeting of the council held in. JohoreBahru about a week before I left Singapore. He alleged that English and indian troops were not entirely blameless, but he was particularly scathing in hisreferences to the Australians. He offered the council &quot; incontrovertible proof &quot;of his charges and, after Inche on n&apos;s opening remarks, the President arranged that the matter should be discussed in secret at a later stage. One of my reporterswas present at this meeting and took a full note of the statements made. He alsobrought me a message from the Prime Minister of Johore (Ungku Aziz), who is adose personal friend, asking me if I would do my utmost to see that no mention of the matter was made public. Just one more example : A man came into myoffice about the 5th February to discuss a business matter. He produced a largecigarette case (gold). I asked him jokingly if he had won a big sweep at the lastrace meeting. He replied : &quot; No, 50 dollars from an Australian soldier and noquestions asked.&quot; After I had expressed myself forcibly on his participation insuch a transaction, he added: &quot;Well the owner had lost it anyway, and if Ihadn&apos;t bought it somebody else would. And this isn&apos;t the only one by a longchalk!&quot;I come now to the Indian troops. Many fought magnificently; some weredisappointing; some gave themselves up to the enemy distressingly readily. here the Japanese propagandists were at their most brilliant.   By means of radio and
pamphlets dropped from aircraft, they flogged the point that they were fightingonly the white man; that the British were putting Asiatic troops in the front lineas cannon fodder, while the white soldiers remained skulking in the background.They promised that any Asiatic soldier who gave himself up would go unharmed,and there is evidence that the promise was kept, at least in the first instance.Captured Indian soldiers were deprived of their arms and uniforms, given asinglet, shorts and a handful of rice and allowed to go free &quot; Unless you want tocome with us and fight the white man.&quot; Subsequently, the stories of some ofthese men were broadcast from Penang and Bangkok and in some cases the menthemselves spoke into the microphone.Of the British troops, the Argylls were magnificent. I am not a Scot, butfor the rest of my days I am going to raise my hat whenever I see an Argyll! TheEast Surreys and the Leicesters are said to have done very well in the North; theGordons, who were not put into the line until late in the battle, were adequate,and the same applies to the Loyals. It was the troops who arrived after the campaign began who proved most disappointing, but there was every excuse forthem. Without any actual fighting experience of any sort, they were sent up tothe battle areas within 72 hours of landing at Singapore.This mention of the marked superiority of the Argyll and SutherlandHighlanders over any other troops engaged in the campaign brings me to what i submit is the most valuable lesson to be learnt from our defeat. A contributoryfactor to the demoralisation of our troops was the complete inability to counter the Japanese infiltration tactics, and that inability arose mainly from the greatermobility of the enemy. We were not under-equipped in Malaya; we were over-equipped. Our men were over-burdened. We had motor transport everywhereand a large amount of it had to be abandoned. The Japanese soldiers were cladin singlet and shorts and sandshoes. They carried a light tommy gun or rifle anda small bag of ammunition. They also carried small rations and a supply ofquinine or atebrin and many of them wore rubber belts which could be inflated toenable them to cross rivers. They used bicycles freely and transported lightmortars in parts on these bicycles. They &quot; Kept going.&quot; Our own men seemedto expect transport to carry them immediately they withdrew from an actualfighting area. The infantry had lost the art of marching except the Argylls,whose Commanding Officer gave them as strenuous a preparation as could havebeen given to any troops. They did a 100 mile forced march from Mersing to singapore just before the Japanese invasion and they were given much routemarching on Singapore Island. Like the Japanese, they were mobile as menand not mobile as units if they could link up with their transport. Junglefighting is a matter of feet more than of wheels; this is proved by the repeatedsuccess of the infiltration tactics. We were bogged down with the weight ofstuff which could have been dispensed with, and men and materials were usedto provide transport for presentation to the enemy because we were not sufficientlymobile to prevent him getting behind it. Incidentally, when Singapore island was crowded with transport, an Indian brigade, bombed out of its quarters atChangi, made its way on foot to Buller Camp, a distance of about 15 miles, onthe 10th February. The men, looking desperately weary, trudged through thetown and the suburbs in a long stream throughout the day. The effect of thissight on the morale of the Asiatic population was not good!The activities of the fifth column in Malaya were less than was supposed in. the early stages of the fighting. The false impression was created by the Japanesedisguising themselves as Malays or Chinese. Actually the Malays as a wholedid very little to help either side. There were a few active traitors among them,but for the most part their one idea was to keep themselves out of trouble. Theywillingly sold bicycles for &quot; Malayan money &quot; printed in Japan, and they wereeasily persuaded to give information regarding jungle paths and the routes takenby our troops. Among the tricks of active traitors were the laying of largecardboard arrows to direct aircraft to buildings occupied as Headquarters, &amp;c,marking trees to show the locality of gun positions and troop concentrations;indicating routes by carrying a bag of rice having a small hole in it so thatthe white grain left a trail behind the carrier. There were two cases of whitetraitors, the details of which will be known to the authorities. The Police did avery good job in rounding up suspicious characters after the invasion began and very little trouble was experienced from this quarter. Indeed, the MalayanCommunist Party, which had been outlawed for some years, became a great[23749] b 2
help to the authorities. The leaders placed the entire services of the Party atthe disposal of Government and did some very valuable work in organisinglabour forces, in preventing panic in congested districts, in providing guerillasand saboteurs and finally in organising a substantial body of volunteers whowent into action during the fighting on Singapore Island. Had these peoplebeen brought into the picture earlier, a large number of men well suited tojungle warfare might have been raised, but the risk of recognising them was great. They had caused much trouble in the past and delicate political issues were involved. The initiative had to come from the Communists themselves andit had to take the form of action, not words. The leaders came right into the open and the Party&apos;s propaganda sheets called for unqualified support of anythingor anyone fighting against the Japanese. It may have been a case of the MalayanCommunists choosing what was to them the lesser of two evils, but, having remadetheir decision, they showed great enterprise, energy and courage.Malayan Chinese as a whole were more steadfast than the Malays; the Indianlabour forces on estates worked until danger was very close and then retired totheir villages or the jungle. Among the entire Asiatic populace, however, therewas grave disquiet at the speed and completeness of European evacuation of up-country centres. From Penang, for example, every European, male and female, except about six men who ref.c?d to leave, fled. Government Officers andmen in essential services got out as quickly as possible. Much the same thinghappened elsewhere and there were many bitterly sarcastic references amongAsiatics to subjects of the Protecting Power who were concerned only with pro-tecting their own skins and&apos; leaving the &apos;&apos; Protected &apos;&apos; to face whatever mightbefall. This is understandable when it is realised that the people who were soquick to get down to Singapore were not women, children and old men only, butincluded many fit men between the ages of 25 and 45 who had been excused from military duty on the ground that they engaged in essential services!&quot;Singapore itself was in a state of almost complete chaos from the end ofDecember. Civil Servants who had evacuated from the Malay States sought toset up temporary departments in Singapore for no other apparent reason than thepreservation of their jobs. Even the F.M.S. Income Tax Department set itselfup in Singapore after the last Federated State had fallen into Japanese hands.The Civil administration cracked badly and broke completely at some points.There was little co-operation with the Services, and many indications of jealousyand fear that outsiders might poach on the preserves of the Civil Servant. TheGovernor delivered a rousing speech about the time having arrived for action,about the need for cutting red tape, for taking responsibility and getting a move on. It read very well indeed but in the event it proved to be very hollow. Thesystem was too inelastic; the men within it could not adapt themselves to rapidlychanging conditions. The extent to which obstructionists flourished was stagger-ing. The Services cannot be acquitted entirely in this connection. There wasobstructionism there too; there was a lack of co-operation between the variousArms and a lamentable tendency among officers of one Service to blame those of another Service for what was happening.So far as the civilian side is concerned, I give one or two examples to supportthese charges of petty-mindedness Mr. Duff Cooper could give very many more!Late in December, a War Courts Ordinance was passed with the idea of expediting the trial of persons charged with acts of treachery. I was a member of that court.After all the preliminary work had been done, but before anyone had been brought &apos;to trial, the Chief Justice, who disliked the idea intensely, discovered that undera statement of James I or II the whole procedure was unconstitutional and theWar Court was stillborn. Then a measure of martial law was introduced and aMilitary Court set up. This consisted of the same three men who formed the WarCourt (the president having been commissioned as a Lieutenant-Colonel in the singapore Volunteer Force) plus two junior Army officers. Then there was diffi-culty in getting staff (interpreters, registrar, ushers, &amp;c.) and accommodation.Finally Major-General Keith Simmons requisitioned all that was required andthe court assembled to try its first case. After an hour and twenty minutes thePublic Prosecutor announced,that he was not prepared to go on-until he was morecompletely satisfied as to the identity of the man in the dock. By then it had become quite clear that the wrong man had been put.up for trial! Two days later the right man was brought to trial on very flimsy evidence and acquitted.&apos; Thatwas the end of the episode so far as I am aware.   I do not believe the Court sat
again. What was the good of sending people before us if we were too weak tohave them shot out of hand ?Singapore was very backward in the matter of civil defence when the invasionbegan. A hurried drive achieved something, but not nearly as much as it shouldhave done. Again there was obstructionism and evasion of responsibility. ABrigadier (I. Simson) was appointed Director-General of Civil Defence. As his right hand man he chose F. D. Bisseker, Senior Unofficial Member of the Legisla-tive Council, who had repeatedly charged the administration with complacency.The Brigadier and Bisseker went to see the then Colonial Secretary who flatlyrefused to have anything to do with Bisseker until the Brigadier protested. TheColonial Secretary then conceded that Bisseker could remain &quot; In his capacity asyour assistant only.&quot;Surely the lesson of all this is that martial law should have been imposed inthe early stages of the crisis and not at the eleventh hour. I suggest, also, thatwherever possible there should be one supreme commander to direct the activitiesof all the Services engaged in the affected area, plus those of the civil administra-tion. I know there are many difficulties in the way of any such plan, but events in Malaya indicate that in no other way can maximum results be obtained.In regard to labour; an acute shortage developed, although thei^ was lessdesertion than might have been expected. In the attempts to meet the needs ofthe Navy, the Army and the Air Force, a civilian committee, which had the full co-operation of the Chinese and Indian leaders, drafted a scheme setting forthrates of pay, providing for grants to dependents in cases of death or serious injury, allowing for the transport of the workers and the provision of food and special accommodation for their dependents. The whole idea was acceptable toeverybody concerned until the Services discovered that the rates of pay werehigher than those which had been authorised. Signals had to be sent to Londonwhile vital work remained undone, and when the outstanding issues were settled,the position in regard to living costs and the degree of danger involved had soworsened that the workers wanted still higher rates of pay. Cannot theServices Chiefs obtain in advance authority to pay whatever rates are demanded by local conditions ? If not, cannot the local Government be induced to meet thedifference between what the Services are empowered to pay and that which labour will accept? This question of pay also stood in the way of raising a good-sizedfighting force of promising material in Singapore. The Asiatic leaders, on grounds of racial pride, wanted for their men the same pay as is given to thewhite soldier. I know that such a concession would cause serious complicationsin view of the Indian Army rates of pay, but I submit that the problem could be overcome in an emergency by grants from the local Government.The European labour problem was complicated by too rigid insistence uponthe letter of the volunteering scheme. Engineering firms were flooded with workfor the Services, but they could not go full out because some of their men weremobilised in various volunteer units, and release was very difficult to obtain.As to the number of civilians left behind, the Governor of the Straits Settle-ments laid it clown that there should be no discrimination in the matter of evacuation. We were in the struggle together; we would see it out till the bitterend. In point of fact, there was very little evacuation of any sort until the lastmad scramble after the whole system of exit permits had broken down. hundreds of women and elderly and/or infirm men had fallen into the hands of theJapanese, although many ships leaving the port in December and January werehalf empty. A state of siege was then expected, and these useless people, whowould have had to be fed if resistance had continued, could not get away. Therewould have been no protests from the Asiatic communities if the evacuation ofEuropean women and children had been made compulsory, provided facilities hadbeen offered for the departure of ah equal number of Asiatic women and children.The most crushing blow to civilian morale in Malaya was the statement bythe Prime Minister in the House of Commons that we should fight the battlefor Johore foot by foot, whereas it was then common knowledge that the order had been given for the withdrawal to the island in a given time of all forces north of the causeway.The scorched earth policy was feeble. Conflicting advice and instructions were given and in several cases mining companies &quot; shelved &quot; dredges instead of destroying them. Demolition by the Services was on a scale which indicated alack of appreciation of the efficiency of the Japanese engineering corps.   The
enemy&apos;s engineers were superb. Our idea seemed to be to keep the damage cdoneto the minimum, so that there would be less to repair, when we went back! Asa consequence, there can be very little of importance on the mainland of MaJayawhich the enemy has not already restored to full working order.Japanese high-level bombing was uncannily accurate. There was ssoinemachine-gunning of the civilian population in Penang, Ipoh and Kuala Lumtpur,but it must be conceded that air activity over Singapore Island was confinedalmost entirely to legitimate military objectives. True, Changi MilitaryHospital was bombed, but only after someone opened up with a Bren gusi onplanes which had flown over the building three or four times without dropjpinganything.Singapore fell so rapidly because the fight for it was less than half-hearrted ;and for that fact, lack of inspiring leadership must be held largely responsible.Cables have spoken of 73,000 Services prisoners. Let us be conservative ancL put the total at 60,000. The original Japanese landing on the island was made ina the sector held by the Australians. About 5,000 men gained a footing on the firstnight. A counter attack on the following day was a failure and on the secondnight the enemy strengthened his hold. From the moment that a garrison of atleast 60,000 failed to repel an invading force of 5,000. the Battle for singapore. jurewas lost,(Signed) G. W. SEABRIDGIT,Colombo, February 28, 1942.P.S. Received verbally :Dr. Rittmeer, the Ministerof Propaganda, said that the spectacle of a Largenumber of Australians being taken through Batavia under an armed guard had so disgusted the Dutch that he thought it better for the British to keep oust ofJava.
