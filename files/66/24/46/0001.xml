Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1942.MOST SECRET. CoPy No*W.P. (42) 216.May 21, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.-It is requested that special care may be taken to .ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ALLOCATION OF AMERICAN AIRCRAFT TO THE UNITEDKINGDOM.Note by the Secretary of the War Cabinet.THE attached telegram from President Roosevelt and the Prime Minister&apos;reply are circulated to the War Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister.(Signed) E. E- BRIDGES.Great George Street, S. W. 1,May 21, 1942.Telegram No. 147, dated May 20, from President Roosevelt.I HAVE been giving a great deal of thought to the allocation- of combat aircraft manufactured here. It is my clear conviction that, except for a reason-able number in the British Isles, all reserve planes should be removed from areserve status, which is, in fact, an inactive status, in order to strengthenmaximum and continuous air impiict on the enemy.I am sure you will understand our great desire to make the most effective contribution to our combined war effort in every appropriate theater to the limit of our growing capacity. I am confident that our respective Air Forces canadapt themselves in essential cooperation with our respective ground and seaforces whenever and wherever the common cause can be advanced. To-day it is evident that under current arrangements the United States is going to haveincreasing trained air personnel in excess of combat planes in sight for them touse. We are therefore anxious that every appropriate American-made aircraftbe manned and fought by our own crews. Existing schedules of aircraftallocations do not permit us to do this.Not only are present conditions different from those existing at the timeof the Lease-Lend arrangements of last year, but they are different from thosearrived at in the so-called Arnold-Portal agreement of the days immediately following our entry into the war. One example of this difference of the situationis the current position of Australia and New Zealand now and as of five months ago.My thought is that the Combined Chiefs of Staff, with your approval andmine, would determine the strength of aircraft to be maintained in the respectivetheaters of the war.   I think the maximum number of planes possible should be[23846]
maintained in combat, and the minimum number consistent with security be heldin reserve and in operational units, and that American pilots and crews be assigned to man American-made planes far more greatly than at present on thecombat fronts.I propose that Arnold and Towers go to London at once with Evill to meet with Portal and the appropriate Air Officer of Admiralty to discuss the very important details implied in the broad policy expressed in this message. I wouldalso suggest that Portal return here with Arnold, Evill and Towers for the finaldiscussion.Telegram No. 88, dated May 21, from the Prime Minister.YOUR No. 147.1. We understand and respect the generous impulse which inspires theUnited States Air Force to engage American lives in the conflict at the earliest moment. God knows we have no right to claim undue priority in the ranks of honour.   Let us each do our utmost.   So may it be to the end.2. The sole objective must be the optimum air impact on the enemy, month by month. We have both of us to find together the highest fulfilment of this,irrespective of whether British or United States pilots man the aircraft.3. For this purpose a common expansion plan is necessary, and a ruthlessscrutiny of reserves, discrepancies or anything clogging the pipe-lines. Pleasesend Arnold and Towers at the earliest possible moment. We shall lay everythingbefore them.   Portal will return with them.4. I ought to tell you, however, that, as we understand it, General Arnold&apos;sproposals for revision of the allocations of American aircraft to the Royal AirForce mean the loss of nearly 5,000 aeroplanes to us this year. The effect wouldbe to reduce by over 100 squadrons (nearly 2,000 first-line aeroplanes) the force which we had planned to have in action by the Spring of 1943. Dependent on your expected deliveries, we have already taken into service and are now trainingpilots, crews and mechanics for this plan, and ancillary equipment of all kindswill be available for it. Indeed, we have in active theatres of war awaitingaeroplanes at this moment about 30 squadrons, some of them veteran units whichhave lost their equipment in action.5. I hope, Mr. President, you will not take any final decision withoutconsidering how these hundred squadrons are to be replaced by American unitson the various battle-fronts by the dates expected. Without your assurance onthese points the whole structure of our plans would collapse, and an entirely newview of the war would have to be taken.
