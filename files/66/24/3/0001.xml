THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT      /      /Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1942.W.P. (42) 173.April 21, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.20MOST SECRET. - ^ \/^PY NO* 2 new  CONSTRUCTION  PROGRAMME,  1942.Memorandum- by the First Lord of the Admiralty.SINCE I submitted a supplementary programme of New Construction tothe War Cabinet in November 1941 (W.P. (41) 280), Japan has entered the war against us, and although the United States are now our Allies, the opening ofthis new phase in the war, and the operations of the last four months have,temporarily at any rate, altered the balance of naval power to our greatdisadvantage. The Far Eastern war has placed a heavy additional burden on our communications, at the same time exposing these communications to intensiveattack in theatres previously relatively safe; while the task of the fleet in protecting them has, by the loss of bases to Japan, been made much more difficult.It has, I think, been appreciated that the various Shipbuilding Programmes sofar approved by the Cabinet by no means met the Navy&apos;s requirements, being based, not on what was necessary, but on what it was possible, out of our limited resources of labour and material, to allocate for naval shipbuilding. Insubmitting these latest proposals, I must ask my colleagues to bear in mind thatthe Navy is now bearing a far greater strain than at any time since the war began,and that the need for its maintenance and re-re-inforcement is more urgent than ever before.[23575]B
2. Whilst the United States shipbuilding industry will eventually make agreat contribution to the Allied merchant shipping needs, the recent heavy rateof losses makes it uncertain when American building will reach a sufficient scale to close the gap, at present widening, between tonnage required and tonnage available. This is all the more true&quot; when we remember that the demands ofmilitary movements and overseas operations will certainly continue to grow. Onthe other hand, the American programme of tank production which. I understand,exceeds considerably the requirements of the American Overseas army shouldafford some measure of relief to the armour bottle-neck in this country.3. Whilst the United States are undertaking for us a large programme ofsmall craft, they cannot make good our deficiencies in the larger categories, suchas aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers, or in fleet auxiliary vessels, andhaving regard to the factors I have mentioned above I feel justified in asking for an increased share of our resources to be devoted to naval and mercantileshipbuilding.4. As the war progresses, it becomes constantly more evident how utterlyour forces in the various theatres of war depend on sea communications.5. The Programme on which, with the Cabinet&apos;s approval, I propose to embark during 1942 consists of the following ships : I. At Home 2 Fleet Aircraft Carriers.4 Intermediate Aircraft Carriers.6 Medium Cruisers (improved Fiji type).42 Destroyers.2 Sloops.21 Twin Screw Corvettes.10 Single Screw Corvettes.20 Minesweepers (Algerine type).80 Motor Minesweepers.8 &quot; S &quot; Class Submarines.16 &quot; T &quot; Class Submarines.16 &quot;U&quot; Class Submarines.2 Controlled Minelayers.37 Trawlers.48 &quot;Fairmile&quot; M.Ls. tvpe D.40 &quot; Fairmile &quot; M.Ls. type B.8 Motor Gun Boats, 71 ft. type.10 Steam Gun Boats.64 Harbour Defence M.Ls. 72 ft type16 Small M.T.Bs.2 Carrier ships for small M.T.Bs.1 Boom Defence Vessel.
Landing Craft 200 T.L.C.60 M.L.C.150 A.L.C.12 H.S.C.9 Eescue Tugs.3 Salvage Vessels.1 Repair Ship.2 Destroyer Depot Ships.1 Cable Ship.II. Overseas 35 Minesweepers (American B.Y.M.S. type) in Canada.6 Trawlers in Brazil.6. Enquiries are being made with a view to constructing harbour defencemotor launches in New Zealand; I am not yet in a position to submit definite proposals in this respect.Capital Ships.7. I propose to continue work on the 16-inch gun mountings and guns forLion. Modification of the original design of the ship is now, however, essential,and as this will delay the laying down by perhaps a year, I do not include Lionin this year&apos;s programme.Aiixraft Carriers.8. The course of the war has demonstrated convincingly the large part thataircraft, properly trained, equipped and directed, can play in the conduct of thewar at sea. In order to restore freedom of movement to the Fleet in waters whereattack by shore-based aircraft is possible, and to increase the effectiveness of theFleet on the high seas, strong ship-borne air support (additional to that whichshore-based aircraft can provide) is essential. Without this support the Fleet&apos;sutility is severely restricted.Furthermore, the part that ship-borne aircraft can play in defeating thesubmarine and air attack on trade is becoming more and more apparent.The armoured carrier alone can be considered as meeting fully the require-ments of a Fleet carrier. Four of these ships are in service, one is dire to complete in 1943 and one in 1944. I propose to order two of this type during the current year, in addition to the Carrier approved as part of the 1940 SupplementaryProgramme but not yet put in hand.[23575] B 2
It is, however, essential to strengthen this side of the Fleet at the earliestpossible moment, and, as a short-term policy, complementary to the building ofadditional Fleet carriers, I propose to order four carriers of a new &quot; Inter-mediate &quot; type, designed to be comparatively easy and rapid in construction,yet of sufficient speed to operate with the Fleet.Cruisers.9. The entry of Japan into the war may be regarded as offset by the UnitedStates. Consequently our requirements remain at the figure I have statedon previous occasions, namely, a total of 100 cruisers, of which 15 may be over-age. Towards this number we have 55 (of which 17 are over-age) in serviceand 19 under construction. As a result of the entry of Japan into the war itis more than ever necessary to make good the deficiency, and I propose to order6 medium cruisers of the improved Fiji type.Four heavy cruisers with 8-inch guns were authorised in the 1940 Supple-mentary Programme, but have not yet been ordered. The gun-mountings for oneof these were specially authorised in connection with the 1941 SupplementaryProgramme, but it has not been possible yet to put them in hand. As mediumcruisers and aircraft carriers are our most serious need, I propose not to proceedwith any of the four heavy cruisers and to suspend all further work on themountings.Destroyers.10. There is little likelihood of our ever having a sufficient force of these ships, and our programmes for them are determined principally by the limit ofthe capacity which can be found for them. During 1941 our losses in Fleetdestroyers have been heavy, and have counterbalanced the number completingduring the year. I propose to order as many destroyers as are likely to be foundberths 42.There is a requirement for a new type of destroyer having a greater powerof A.A. fire than the existing type, and this has been designed. I propose to order 16 of this type. The remaining berths will be employed on the constructionof the Intermediate type, which is the most suitable craft for general fleet work.I make provision for 26 of this type, two of which will be fitted for minelaying.Sloops.11. These require much the same building facilities as destroyers. Thoughslower, they have greater endurance than our present destroyer, but as the newdesign to which I have just referred gives the destroyer endurance comparable with that of a sloop, it is proposed to build the latter only where this can be donein berths which could not build destroyers. Two sloops are included in the present programme.
Corvettes.12.   There is a very considerable shortage in both the United States and theBritish Fleets of A/S fitted ships, and the entry of Japan into the war hasincreased the requirements by bringing the submarine threat to areas previously- immune.The United States are undertaking a very considerable building programmeof this type of ship, but deliveries are not expected before 1943. A largeproportion of these ships are building to British account, but there is no guarantee that the United States may not take over some of them to meet their own requirements.In order to meet the immediate need of the United States for A/S escortswe are turning over to them 10 &quot; Flower &quot; Class corvettes.In these circumstances I propose to order 21 Twin-Screw Corvettes, and(from firms who cannot build twin-screw type) 10 of the single-screw &quot; Flower &quot;Class.M inesweepers.13. In view of the increased commitments due to the spread of the warit is proposed to include in the Programme : 20 &quot; Algerine &quot; Class Minesweepers, for work with the Fleet (also fittedA/S).80 130-ft. motor minesweepers, for work in the approaches to ports.I may say that the production of engines is the bottleneck in the constructionof motor minesweepers. With Treasury concurrence, therefore, orders havealready been placed for all the engines required for these Motor Minesweepers,and for some vessels in addition, which are expected to be included in subsequentProgrammes.In addition, it is proposed to order in Canada 35 minesweepers, of a smallAmerican type.Submarines.14. We Can usefully employ every submarine that can be built, and theextension of the war to the Far East has considerably increased our requirements.I propose, therefore, to order 8 &quot; S,;&apos; 18 &quot; T &quot; and 16 &quot;U&quot; Class submarinesduring the year.Controlled Minelayers.15. These are required for the laying of harbour defences. One was lostduring the past year, and two are proposed to replace the casualty and to providefor our new needs in the East.[23575] B 3
Trawlers.16. Some of our older trawlers, after three years of war, are becoming unfit for further service. At the same time, the submarine and mine threat hasextended to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Capacity can probably be found for37 during the year, and this number is accordingly included. We already havea few trawlers building in Brazil and it is proposed to place orders for another6 vessels in that country.Coastal Craft.17.   Under this head, I propose the following orders :  48 Fairmile launches, type D (4-engined craft, for attacks on enemycoastal shipping and. E-boa ts, and for protection of any cross-channeloperations).40 Fairmile launches, type B (2-engined craft, for anti-submarine and coastal convoy work).8 Motor Gun Boats (71-ft. high-speed boats, similar to the earlierM.T.Bs., but armed for attacks on E-boats).64 Harbour Defence Motor Launches.10 Steam Gun Boats.The first of the Steam Gun Boats has successfully passed its trials, and it ishoped that in this we have produced a vessel particularly useful in attackingenemy shipping in the North Sea and the Channel, and more than a match forthe E-boat.Small M.T.Bs. and Depot Ships.18. It is proposed to build small M.T.Bs. (50&apos; type) which can be taken incarrier ships and launched near the scene of attack. I include 16 M.T.Bs. andtwo Depot Ships to carry them in the Programme.Landing Craft.19. When the 1941 Supplementary Programme was before the Cabinetlast November, I was asked to consider the possibility of increasing the TankLanding Craft programme.This matter has been investigated both in the United Kingdom and inAmerica. It is not practicable without encroaching on capacity required! forother shipbuilding, mainly Corvettes, Auxiliary Aircraft Carriers and merchant ships, to increase the production of T.L,.Cs. in the United Kingdom beyond the300 craft envisaged in the 1941 Supplementary Programme as being produced by March 1943. We have succeeded in getting the United States to createcapacity towards meeting the target requirement of the equivalent of 700 T.L.Cs.from America, but it is not expected that more than the equivalent of 175 will beavailable from this source by March 1943.
As regards further building of landing craft in this country, it is to beexpected that new requirements will arise after March 1943 and for this reason,and to make good casualties in operations which may be undertaken meanwhile,it is proposed to continue placing orders throughout the period of this programme.I accordingly include provision for : 200 Tank Landing Craft.60 Motor Landing Craft.150 Assault Landing Craft.12 Heavy Support Craft.Repair and Depot Ships.20. The loss of shore facilities in the Far East and the need for maintaining our large and increasing forces of light craft necessitates the provision of depotand repair ships. Immediate steps are being taken to convert 5 A.M.Cs., but these will not meet full needs and I accordingly make provision for 1 Repair ship and 2 Destroyer Depot Ships in the Programme.Miscellaneous Vessels.21.   I include in this Programme : 1 Cable Ship, required for work in the Indian Ocean.9 Rescue Tugs.3 Salvage Vessels.Loss of Building Capacity in the Far East.I should explain that, as a result of the loss of Hong Kong, Singapore anuRangoon, we have to write off a number of vessels building in these ports to ourorder, namely : 4 &apos;&apos; Bangor &apos;: Minesweepers.16 &quot; Fairmile &quot; launches &quot; B &quot; type.14 Motor Minesweepers.2 Salvage Tugs.14 Harbour Defence Motor Launches.4 Trawlers.Orders to make good these losses are included in the figures given in thepreceding paragraphs.Construction in the United States.22. During the recent conversations in Washington the United StatesGovernment agreed provisionally to additional construction to meet british requirements.
The total of this construction including items previously accepted under the1st and 2nd Lease-Lend Appropriations is now : 300 Convoy Escort Vessels.15 Auxiliary Aircraft Carriers (converted merchant ships).700 Tank Landing Craft.17 Tank Landing Craft Carriers.400 Tank Lighters.32 Fleet Minesweepers.230 Motor Minesweepers.150 Anti-Submarine Vessels.14 Salvage Vessels.20 Rescue Tugs.42 M.T.Bs.54 Harbour Defence M.Ls.46 Air Rescue Boats.100 Eurekas.20 Boom Defence Vessels.The United States have accepted this task on the understanding that theEmpire Production of these types shall be maintained at the maximum.On the other hand, in order to meet immediate requirements of the UnitedStates Navy, we have agreed to release to them ten of our corvettes, as I havealready mentioned.23.
