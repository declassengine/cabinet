(42) 213.May 20, 1942.WAR CABINET.UNITED NATIONS DAY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has proclaimed the 14th June (the traditionalAmerican Flag Day) a &quot; United Nations Day,&quot; to be earmarked by the flyingof the flags of the United Nations along with the Stars and Stripes, and byother appropriate celebrations, including broadcast addresses. The United states ambassador, in sending me formally a copy of the Proclamation, has drawn attention to the passage which invites American citizens to honour not only theirown flag but also those of the States who have signed the Declaration of theUnited Nations.2. Lord Halifax having telegraphed to me that he had reason to believethat the United States authorities would welcome His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom taking a similar step on the same day, I consulted theMinister of Information. While we realise that a good deal of time and troublewill be involved, we are in agreement that there are political advantages inhonouring here also the United Nations, and that such a. celebration should bestaged. Accordingly,, and after consulting the Prime Minister, I have informedLord Halifax that His Majesty&apos;s Government will similarly celebrate the united nations Day in this country. Time, however, is short, and the Minister of Infor-mation has prepared a draft programme.3. It is suggested that the principal celebration in this country should be aparade in London, representative of the United Nations (including the Colonies,India, the Free French and, of course, the Dominions); that His Majesty TheKing should take the review; and that the heads of Allied States in this country,and the representatives of the other nations concerned, should be invited to attend.The Ministry of Information would arrange the necessary publicity and suitablelocal celebrations in other parts of the country. It has been suggested that afilm be prepared for the event, containing a message either from His majesty the King or from the Prime Minister.4. If these suggestions, which it is not anticipated would involve muchexpenditure, are approved, it is proposed that (1) the Prime Minister should ascertain The King&apos;s pleasure, and (2) a co-ordinating committee be formed ofrepresentatives of the&quot;Ihre&apos;e&quot;&quot;Services, the Foreign Office, the India Office; theDominions Office, the Colonial Office, and the Ministries of Home Security, war transport and Labour, under the chairmanship of the Ministry of Information,to decide and carrv out the practical arrangements involved.A.
