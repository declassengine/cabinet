Affairs,When the Soviet Chemical Warfare Delegation   were informed by the British Delegation of the decisionsRreaohedby the War Cabinet on 7th May   regarding the supply of half-a-million G.8. respirators, the. Russians showedgrave concern at the small proportion of their request for- 3 million respirators which had been met.      Theyearnestly begged that it should be considered whether further allocations of respirators,  of which they hadthe most pressing need, could not be made during the summer^  and suggested that if necessary the SovietGovernment might be willing to make good to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the equivalent of the rubber contained in anyf ur t he r &quot;s supplies lies.2.      The matter was further examined by the Departmentsconcerned and referred to me,  as Chairman of the allied supplies Executive.      I discussed the question with mycolleagues at a meeting of the Executive on 11th May,and the following conclusions were reached:-w(a) An additional half million G.S. respiratorsshould be offered to the Russians for promptshipment - making one million in all.(b) Provided the Ministry of Supply couldincrease production to the necessary extent,a further half million respirators might be offered for shipment in duly,(c) The Russians should be informed of thedecision at (a), but no firm promise of therespirators in (b)  should be given.      Theyshould be informed that it may be necessaryfor the amount of rubber required for themanufacture of any respirators furnishedunder (a)  or (b)  to be subtracted from united Kingdom quotas.56   W.M.(42) 58th Conclusions, Minute 2.

(a) The sacrifice involved by the offer of theserespirators would be shared by the Departmenconcorned in proportion to their allocations3. In view of the agreement which has been reached with the user Departments, I decided that it was unnecessary to trouble the War Cabinet for a furtherdecision in the matter, but I think it well that mycolleagues should be informed of the position and,in particular,  that they should be aware that theRussians have been informed as   under (c)  in regardto the subtraction from the quota of raw rubber to be allocated to them of the amount of this material which isrequired for the manufacture, of all the respirators.Great George Street, S.W.I.,13th May,  1942*-
