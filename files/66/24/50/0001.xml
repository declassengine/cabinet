I HAVE been discussing for the last few days with M. Molotov the negotia-tion of a political and a military treaty on the lines of the drafts which I had previously communicated to the Soviet Ambassador, and which I circulated again to my colleagues this morning.Complete agreement has been reached in the case of the military treaty.As regards the political treaty, agreement has been reached, subject to minor alterations, in the case of the Preamble and Articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8.Agreement has not been reached in the case of the following threesubjects :  (1) The manner in which the interests of Poland are to be safeguarded withregard to their frontier with the Soviet Union.M. Molotov objected to this subject being dealt with in the second part ofArticle 3 of the Treaty itself, as I had intended, and proposed instead that thereshould be an exchange of letters on the subject. (For draft of proposed Russianletter, see Annex I.) This draft ignores our interest and obligations in thismatter, and makes no reference to the assurance which I gave to the PolishGovernment in July last, to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not recognise any territorial changes which have been effected in Poland since August 1939. But I was prepared to accept M. Molotov&apos;s draft letter on theunderstanding that I should, in a letter replying to it, reaffirm the assurancewhich I gave to the Polish Government last July. (My draft reply is given in annex II.) M. Molotov objects that by this assurance we have already takensides on the question of the future frontier between Poland and the soviet union, and he asks that to meet this point I should also in my letter refer to thestatement I made at the time in the House of Commons, to the effect that myassurance to the Polish Government did not involve any guarantee of frontiersby His Majesty&apos;s Government. I have reserved this request for furtherconsideration.(2) The provision for enabling the inhabitants of the Baltic States, Bessarabia,and the annexed parts of Finland to emigrate if they so desire.Article 4 of the draft treaty embodies this provision and was inserted atthe suggestion of President Roosevelt, who said that such a stipulation wouldmake the treaty more palatable to American public opinion. M. Molotov,however, refuses to accept it unless the inhabitants who are to have the rightto emigrate are defined as inhabitants belonging to national minorities. this restriction would not meet the Presidents main point, since it would not applyto the nationals of the States absorbed. I have not accepted M. Molotov&apos;amendment and have undertaken . to refer to my colleagues.(3) The new Soviet proposal that provision should be made to cover the special interests which the Soviet Government claim to have in Roumania and finland for the purposes of their security.M. Molotov proposed that this should be dealt with by means of a secretprotocol (see Annex III), which provides for the negotiation of treaties of mutual assistance between the Soviet Government and Finland and Roumania,which would also guarantee the independence of these two States.    It willMOST SECRET.Copy No.11724   [23861]
further be observed that in an effort to make it palatable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the Soviet Government propose that there should be analogousarrangements covering our supposed interests in Belgium and Holland. on my declining to accept this protocol M. Molotov proposed, as an alternative,that the subject should be dealt with in vaguer terms in Article 3, which wouldthen run as follows : &quot; The High Contracting Parties undertake to work for the reconstruction of Europe after the war with full regard to the interests of the security ofGreat Britain, especially in. the region of the Straits of Dover and thesouthern part of the North Sea, and of the security of the U.S.S.R., especiallyin the region of the Gulf of Finland and the north-western part of the black sea, as well as to the interests of the U.S.S.R. in the restoration of itsfrontiers violated by the aggression of Hitlerite Germany and her european allies, and in accordance with the two principles of not seeking territorialaggrandisement for themselves and of non-interference in the internal affairs of other peoples.&quot;I have declined to agree to this proposal (a) because we do not want anymention in the treaty of our interests in the North Sea or the Straits of Dover;and (&amp;)- because the reference to Soviet interest in both these areas, andparticularly in the Black Sea, would arouse all sorts of suspicions.Before the negotiations had reached this point, and when it did not look.as though we were likely to make satisfactory progress on the present draft treaty,I proposed, as an alternative, to M. Molotov that we should conclude a treaty of mutual assistance for twenty years on the lines of the text which I circulated/-j^. to my colleagues on the 22nd May (W.P. (42)2X8). This treaty would omit/ the contentious provisions about territories and frontiers, while embodying all elsethat is essential and has been agreed upon in both the military and the politicaltreaty. M. Molotov&apos;s first answer Avas that, while interested, hie could not discuss this new proposal until he had returned to Moscow; and that meanwhile he wouldlike to get on with the political treaty which we had been discussing up till now.He has now, however, intimated his readiness to discuss the new treaty, and Ishall do so with him this afternoon.I intend to submit to my colleagues verbally my proposals for dealing withthe situation which has noAv developed.A.

Annex I.The Draft Note from the Soviet Plenipotentiary to Mr. Eden about Poland.Sir,ON the occasion of the signature to-day of the treaty between U.S.S.R. andGreat Britain concerning settlement of the post-war problems and their jointactivities for the guaranty of security in Europe after the termination of thewar against Germany and her European allies, I have to declare on behalf ofthe Government of the U.S.S.R. as follows : The Soviet Government considers it as self-evident that the question of thepost-war frontiers between the U.S.S.R. and the Polish Republic will formthe subject of a special agreement between the Polish and the Soviet governments in accordance with the understanding reached some time ago between thechairman of the Council of People&apos;s Commissars, I. V. Stalin, and the PrimeMinister of the Polish Republic, General W. Sikorski. In this connexion theSoviet Government expresses its confidence that the said question will be settled by mutual agreement between the two countries in the spirit of friendly alliedrelations.Accept, Sir, my expression of highest consideration and esteem.Annex II.Draft Note from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to theSoviet Plenipotentiary about Poland.Sir,I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of to-day&apos;date on the occasion of the signature of the treaty dealing with post-warco-operation between our two countries.In taking note of the declaration contained in your letter relating to thefrontier between the TJ.S.S.R. and the Polish Republic, I have the honour toinform you as follows : It is the understanding of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom that the reference to frontiers in Article 3 of the treaty referred to above doesnot affect the frontiers of Poland. The position of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin this regard remains as stated in the communication made by them to the PolishGovernment on the 30th July, 1941, in connexion with the signature of theagreement concluded on that day between the Soviet Union and Poland.Annex III.Draft Protocol regarding Finland and Roumania.SUPPLEMENTARY protocol to the treaty between the U.S.S.R. and GreatBritain for the solution of post-war questions and for their joint actions toensure security in Europe after the conclusion of the war with Germany and her allies in Europe.The parties to the above-mentioned treaty signed this day think itnecessary to define the provisions of Article 3 of the treaty in question, andhave agreed on the following in the interests of the security of the U.S.S.R.and Great Britain : (1) In view of the fact that Finland broke the treaty of peace with theSoviet Union, signed by her on the 12th March; 1940, took part together withGermany in a faith-breaking attack on the U.S.S.R., rejected the peacefulproposals of the Government of the U.S.S.R. in the summer of 1941 for the cessation of hostilities and remained in the Hitlerite camp to continue heraggressive policy, it is recognised as essential, in addition to the re-establishment
in full force of the provisions of the treaty of the 12th March, 1940, that theSoviet Union and Finland, for the purpose of ensuring the security of both countries and of averting during the post-war period a breaking of the peace on the part of Germany in that part of Europe, should conclude between them-selves a treaty of mutual assistance with a guarantee of the independence off inland.(2) In view of the fact that Roumania broke the frontiers agreementbetween the U.S.S.R. and Roumania, laid down in an exchange of notes betweenthe Soviet and Roumanian Governments on the 27th to 28th June, 1940, and took part together with Geimiany in a faith-breaking attack on the U.S.S.R.,it is recognised as essential, in addition to the re-establishment of the Soviet-Roumanian frontiers, in conformity with the above-mentioned ageement, thatthe Soviet Union and Roumania, for the purpose of ensuring the security ofboth countries, and of averting during the post-war period a breaking of thepeace by Germany in that part of Europe, should conclude between themselves a treaty of mutual assistance with a guarantee of the independence of Roumania.(3) For the purpose of creating guarantees of the independence of belgium and Holland and also of ensuring the security of Great Britain, Belgium and holland recognise that it is necessary for treaties of mutual assistance to be concluded between Great Britain and each of the States in question.

MOST SECRET. Copy No.   \ 7TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document,FIRST  MEETING WITH  THE  SOVIET DELEGATION  AT  No.  10DOWNING STREET, AT 11-30 a.m. ON MAY 21, 1942.Present:Prime Minister.Secretary of  State  for  ForeignAffairs.Secretary of State for Dominions.Sir Alexander Cadogan.Sir Orme Sargent.Brigadier Firebrace.THE PRIME MINISTER welcomed M. Molotov and expressed gratificationat his safe arrival in this country.M. MOLOTOV replied, thanking the Prime Minister for his kind reception and for the hospitality extended to him. He begged leave to open the proceedingswith a statement on behalf of his Government.M. Molotov explained, that he was authorised to conduct negotiations inLondon concerning two questions, the second of which he proposed to discuss further in America with the United States Government.The first question raised several points arising out of the discussions which took place in Moscow in December last. There were the two draft treaties, the protocol proposed by the Soviet Government and the draft letter from M. Stalinon the subject of Poland.The second question concerned the opening of a second front in Europe.M.. Molotov said that these were the main questions which he had come todiscuss, although, of course, both sides could raise other questions of interest to both Governments.In regard to the first question of the treaties, he hoped that this might besettled in the next few days, and he was prepared at once to discuss it in detail.The Soviet Government attached considerable weight to this first question, buthe must state that they considered the second as on the whole the more important.This second question had been raised also by the President of the United States,who, in a message to M. Stalin, had said that, as it was not possible to arrange a meeting between himself and M. Stalin, it was desirable that M. Molotovshould go to the United States. The Soviet Government had agreed to thisproposal, and had thought it well that he should discuss this question with thePrime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in London onhis way to Washington.He wished to remind his hearers that it was nearly a year now since Hitlerattacked the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Government thought it right that&apos;President Roosevelt should have raised this question, of which the Soviet Govern-ment realised the importance, not only for their own country, but for GreatBritain and the United States as well.   He admitted that the question was in a11723-1   [23854-1]M. Molotov.M. Maisky.M. Pavlov.
sense a military one, and for that reason and because President Roosevelt had suggested it, he had brought with him a Major-General who was informed on questions of detail. But the question was primarily a political one, and discussionof it should be conducted on political lines both with Great Britain and theUnited States.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was very glad to hear thatM. Molotov was going to the United States to discuss this question of a second front. Had he considered the importance of letting this become public? If he were to make the fact public at his own time, it would have the best reception in the United States. But if it were to leak out that he was in England, a greatamount of questioning might arise and he would not have the advantage of makingthe announcement himself in the best form. It was most unlikely that secrecycould be altogether observed. His Majesty&apos;s Government could prevent anythingappearing in the press here, but there were neutral Missions in London who wouldbe able to inform their Governments by cypher telegram.THE SECRETARY OF STATE observed that the American correspondentshere were all friendly and could be trusted to send good messages to their papers.But if the news leaked out, there was no censorship in the United Statescomparable to ours, and the news would probably be presented in an undesirable form.M. MOLOTOV said that the Soviet Government had already requested theUnited States Government to allow no publication before his return to the soviet union. They thought it best to follow the same methods as were followed inregard to the Moscow meeting in December last. It was true that reports of his visit might leak out, but there was a difference between that and having the factofficially confirmed. He therefore asked that all possible measures might be taken for ensuring secrecy. He fully understood that His Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot be responsible for leakage through neutral missions, but he hoped that every possible precaution would be taken.THE PRIME MINISTER admitted that this question was for M. Molotovto decide: he.only wished to explain how His Majesty&apos;s Government viewed thematter, and he undertook to do everything possible to keep M. Molotov&apos;s presenceand his plans secret.The Prime Minister suggested that it might be well to begin with a general discussion on the draft treaty. After such general discussion a furtherconversation might take place in the afternoon with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, with a view to settling any outstanding points of difference.. As regards a second front, the Prime Minister was ready to have a generalinterchange of views at this meeting and then to have a further meeting the next morning at 11 a.m. at which he would preside and which would be attended bythe Chiefs of Staff. The Prime Minister would be glad if M. Molotov would bring the Russian Major-General and anyone else whom he wished to assist him in the technical discussion.The Prime Minister then invited M. Molotov to open the discussion on thedraft treaties.M. MOLOTOV said that there were two sets of Treaties one British andone Russian -before&apos; the meeting. He observed that the British draft of thepolitical Treaty, which had been recently communicated to the Soviet Ambassador,differed to a great extent from what had been discussed in Moscow. The changesthus introduced had called forth serious objection in the U.S.S.R. He asked what prevented the acceptance of the Soviet drafts. He would like to have asummary of the British point of view.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was necessary to put beforeM. Molotov the fact that the Soviet draft political Treaty was not at all free fromgrave difficulties so far as this country was concerned. It could be argued thatit contravened the spirit of the Atlantic Charter. At the same time it was quite clear that President Roosevelt would not favourably endorse the Treaty,&apos;either inthe British or in the Soviet form, and that very sharp criticism would arise in theUnited States which would be reflected in England and which would certainly lead to serious controversy detrimental to our common effort.   However, such
was our desire to make our Russian comrades and allies feel that our friendshipwas not to end with the war but to continue afterwards for the well-being of both countries, for the security of Russia, for the total annihilation of the Nazi regime and for the protection of both our countries from the renewal of the horrible warsthat have marked our lifetime as a result of German aggression, that we wereprepared to sign a Treaty on the lines of the latest British draft. We had togive account of our acts to Parliament, and it was absolutely necessary that thereshould be in the Treaty certain conditions that would enable His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to procure the general assent of the great majority of the Britishnation. But if the Government failed to consider public opinion and feelings,controversy would arise that would do more harm than good to all our interests.Therefore, he hoped that&apos;M. Molotov would be able to go into all these pointswith the Secretary of State and see in what way agreement could be reached.- M. MOLOTOV said that he would certainly do this : the. Soviet Governmentwere anxious to settle the texts of both Treaties first with the British Government.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that we were not dependent on the UnitedStates Government in this matter, but at the same time we had to take grave note of American opinion.M. MOLOTOV agreed that both Governments would have to take account ofpublic opinion in America and of the Presidents views. But, on the other hand,he must observe that, if account had to be taken of British public opinion, so alsothe opinion in his own country must be considered.If it proved impossible to find a Treaty agreeable to both parties, it wouldbe necessary to postpone the matter. It might be possible to continue for sometime without a Treaty, though, of course, it would be better to sign one now ifpossible. Now that hostilities had been proceeding for nearly a year, this questionof the Treaty had become more acute than it was in December last. The soviet union had suffered and would have to suffer, and had sustained and would have-to sustain many sacrifices. N o one in his country would agree to the signatureby the Soviet Government of a Treaty which did not contain the minimum .of provisions which would justify the sacrifices made and which did not contain the minimum of provisions for the future security of the country. The Sovietdraft stated the minimum conditions acceptable to the Soviet Government andpublic opinion, and it would be difficult-^perhaps, indeed, impossible to makeany further concessions.It would be foolish for any Government to disregard public opinion in itsown country, but when it was suggested that the Soviet Government should take account also of opinion in Lithuania, Latvia or Poland, then he must say that many complicated questions would arise. Despite all the differences between poland and the U.S.S.R. which were still unsettled, the Soviet Governmentnevertheless hoped, and were prepared, to come to terms with the Polish Govern-ment on all questions, but they were only prepared to do so on the basis of theirown minimum interests. He hoped that this point of view of the Soviet Govern-ment would be fully understood by His Majesty&apos;s Government.When he spoke of &quot;minimum conditions,&quot; he meant that his Governmentinsisted on recovering the territory violated by Hitler, and they could make no concessions in this respect. Further, it was not sufficient simply to restore whatexisted before the war : the Soviet Government must secure their territory ontheir north-western and south-western frontiers Without some guarantee in thisrespect (he was referring to the proposed Pacts of mutual assistance), no one inthe Soviet Union would approve the Treaty. If within these limits it should prove possible to find an agreed draft, that would be very good. If, however, itwas not found possible to come to terms with His Majesty&apos;s Government on this basis, it might be better to postpone the whole matter.The most delicate question was that concerning Poland. The Soviet Govern -ment would do their best to come to terms- with Poland on the basis of mutualinterests and on the question of frontiers.M. Molotov said that, of course, he was speaking for the Soviet Government,but the latter were ready to take all possible account of the views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. He must, however, assert that the Soviet minimum conditions were essential: his Government would try to meet His Majesty&apos;s Government in everyway and believed that they had done so by the proposals which they had made.
THE PRIME MINISTER observed that; in accordance with the proposalhe had made earlier, he hoped that points of difference might be discussed in the afternoon with the Secretary of State. But he would like, if he could, to makeM. Molotov understand what was the true British objective. We believed that Owe should win the war, and that after the war Great Britain, Russia and theUnited States would share the responsibility of guiding the forward movementof the world. Our wish was that the three Governments should work together for that and for their own security and mutual assistance. Therefore, it was important that no document should take a form which tended to emphasisedifferences between the three countries who were bearing the full weight of thewar, and would be accountable to mankind for what was clone after the Nazityrannv had been destroyed.It was that friendship and trustful co-operation that we must have mview.   If that were achieved, other matters would easily fall into their place.The Prime Minister would like to make one observation in regard to thequestion of a second front. The United States Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were resolved to invade the continent of Europe as soon as possible,with as large a force as possible. They contemplated building up in european great front and also rousing the populations of the countries now held in Nazidomination and liberating them. To this end the two Governments wereresolved to take every possible measure. Therefore, there could be no differenceon the main issue, but the question would have to be explored on technical lines,namely shipping, transport, landing facilities, air cover, &amp;c.The Prime Minister said that when he met President Roosevelt last Augusthe had already suggested to him the construction of the largest possible numberof landing craft. He had reverted to the matter also during his later visit inJanuary. In Great Britain every possible effort was being made to preparefacilities for the invasion of the Continent. Risks would be run provided therewas a reasonable hope of success. After full discussion M. Molotov would see what were the limitations which physical facts such as shipping, provision of landing craft, &amp;c, put upon our action from the point of view of time.M. MOLOTOV said he fully shared the Prime Ministers view on theimportance of the friendship of the two countries, which was based on historicalfacts. He was confident that the maintenance of this friendship would producegood results also after the conclusion of hostilities.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that he had meant to emphasise theimportance of the three Governments British, Soviet and United States working together during and after the war.M. MOLOTOV fully accepted this.Regarding the question of a second front, he well understood the limitations,but he hoped that the question would be settled in a positive sense and favourablyin regard to time.THE PRIME MINISTER said that anyone would understand that the longer the matter was postponed, the more difficult it might become, and wewere fully aware of the need for the utmost speed. He suggested that theRussian Major-General might be put in touch with the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.M. MOLOTOV expressed a preference for a discussion in the first placeon the political plane.The meeting then adjourned.
MOST SECRET. Copy No. 1 7TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document,oSECOND MEETING WITH THE  SOVIET  DELEGATION  at no. 10 DOWNING STREET, AT 3-30 p.m, MAY 21, 1942.Present:The Secretary of State for Foreign      M. Molotov.Affairs. M. Maisky.Sir Alexander Cadogan. M. Sobolev.Sir.Orme Sargent. M. Pavlov.Brigadier Firebrace.THE SECRETARY OF STATE referred at first to the two drafts of theMilitary Treaty and suggested that there was no essential difference betweenthem.M. MAISKY pointed out that the British draft included the words &quot; andin accordance with the declaration by the United Nations signed at Washington on the 1st January, 1942,&quot; which did not appear in the Soviet draft.THE SECRETARY of STATE agreed to the omission of these words.M. MAISKY further pointed out that, according to the British draft, the ratifications were to be exchanged in London, whereas in the Soviet draft it was stated that they should be exchanged in Moscow.THE SECRETARY OF STATE agreed that the Soviet text should beaccepted.Turning to the Political Treaty, M. MOLOTOV stated that he wished tomaintain the Soviet draft, which he said corresponded more with the discussions in Moscow.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that there were, however, one or two points to which His Majesty&apos;s Government attached importance. In the firstplace, there was the principle embodied in Article 4 of the British draft. Apartfrom their own desires in this matter, His Majesty&apos;s Government had included-this provision because President Roosevelt had asked for it or something like it.The Secretary of State would appeal to the Soviet Delegation for assistance inthis matter.   He was not bound to any particular form of words.M. MOLOTOV said that he would like to deal first with the points whichhad already been discussed in Moscow, and then with others that had been raised since.It was agreed to go through the draft article by article and then to take thedraft protocol.Note was taken of the fact that the preamble was identical in both drafts.In regard to Article 1, M. MOLOTOV questioned the words added at theend of that Article in the British draft &quot; and in concert with the other states concerned.&quot; It was finally agreed that the text should run, &quot; taking intoconsideration the interests of the other States concerned.&quot;11723-2   [23854-2] B
The Soviet text of Article 2 was accepted with the substitution of the words&quot; Germany or the States associated with her &quot; for &quot; Germany and the Statesassociated with her.&quot;With regard to Article 3, M. MOLOTOV stated that his Government hadbeen somewhat surprised at the British draft. M. Stalin and he himself had hadthe impression that it was agreed that the Soviet Government and the PolishGovernment would reach direct agreement as between allies. This draft Article,however, raised a new question. His Government had been under the impression that the question of the Polish-Soviet frontier was left open for future discussion:they wished so to leave it, and did not desire that Great Britain or Poland shouldbe committed more than they were already committed. He was prepared to givea letter to the Polish Government, which should not, however, be mentioned inthe Treaty.THE SECRETARY OP STATE said that he quite understood that thequestion of the Polish frontier should be left open for discussion. Our difficulty was, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government had certain commitments to poland to which reference was expressly made when the Soviet-Polish Agreement was signed last year. His Majesty&apos;s Government only wished by this Article toindicate that that position was maintained, and he thought that this was theeasiest way of meeting any Polish doubt as to whether the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government had changed or not. He saw no objection to dealing withthe matter outside the Treaty by means of an exchange of letters.M. MOLOTOV drew attention to his draft letter to Mr. Eden.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that the difficulty presented by that draft was that it appeared to exclude the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentarising out of their declaration to Poland.M. MOLOTOV said that he was ready to sign a treaty with Poland on thebasis of the Curzon Line. He was also ready to treat on the basis of the lineoccupied in 1941. This remained the Soviet aim, in view of the great sacrificesmade by the TJ.S.S.R. The other alternative was to leave the question open to direct settlement between the two countries. M. Molotov added that certain minor alterations would have to be made in the Curzon Line in favour of the SovietGovernment.THE SECRETARY OF STATE recalled that when he was.in Moscow hehad no authority to agree to the Soviet proposals concerning the Baltic States.Now on that point His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to agree; they had made this concession, and they were prepared to agree to the phrase proposed bythe Soviet Government. The only thing they wished to do was to safeguard their position with Poland as it was at the time of the signature of the Soviet-PolishTreaty. Therefore, if M. Molotov were to address him in the terms of the draft letter he might perhaps reply on the lines of the second sentence of the second paragraph of the British Article 3.M. MOLOTOV replied that this would present great difficulty as it wouldgive rise to doubt about the position in the future. The Soviet point of view wasthat Poland should be compensated at the expense of Germany by receiving east prussia. That would be entirely justifiable, but it was not suitable that that should be included in the present Treaty. The effect of the British draft wouldbe that the British Government were supporting one side in the Soviet-Polishfrontier discussion. He could give every assurance that his Government wishedto discuss the matter with the Polish Government in the most friendly manner,but Poland should settle the matter direct with the U.S.R.R. M. Molotov hopedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would understand the Soviet point of view as stated in his letter; they did not ask His Majesty&apos;s Government to confirm theposition.There seemed, in his view, to be two alternatives : (1) To agree to the Curzon Line with certain changes; or(2) To postpone consideration of the matter.M. Molotov observed that, in proposing to leave the Soviet-Polish frontieropen to further discussion, his Government were leaving undecided the greaterpart of their Western frontier.  This was a great concession on their part and he;
asked what concession His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to make. the concession he asked of His Majesty&apos;s Government was that the latter should not maintain their support of the Polish cause.THE SECRETARY OF STATE observed that that presented great difficulty-He reminded M. Molotov that His Majesty&apos;s Government had tried to meet theSoviet Government by agreeing to certain frontiers which the latter claimed.There remained the frontier with Poland. As regards Poland His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were bound by an agreement signed before the outbreak of war. Hethought that the Soviet proposal with regard to East Prussia was very wise andhe agreed that it was not necessary actually to draw the frontier now, but what he was bound to do was to safeguard the position of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwith regard to Poland as it was at the time of the Soviet-Polish Agreement. Ifthis were not done, the Polish Government would at once accuse His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of going back on the agreement which they gave with Russianacquiescence.M. MOLOTOV said that the Soviet Government could not accept that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should take sides in this matter. He suggested that itwas a choice between the Curzon Line with modifications or postponement of thequestion. This concession by His Majesty&quot;s Government would be smaller thanthat which the Soviet Government were- making, and further concession for them would be impossible.THE SECRETARY OF STATE assured M. Molotov that- His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had no desire to take the Polish side. He agreed that the Soviet-Polish frontier could be left for later settlement; all he asked was that in replyto M. Molotov&apos;s draft letter he should be allowed to express our point of view asit had been stated in July 1941.M. MOLOTOV said that the draft letter stated the concession which hisGovernment were prepared to make. M. Stalin in his recent Order of the day had claimed the restoration of all frontiers violated by Hitler, and this point could not be abandoned. But the Soviet Government were prepared to give an assurance that the Soviet-Polish frontier would be settled by friendly discussion between the two Governments. In return he asked that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should make a concession as there must be concessions by both sides affordinga basis for good relations between the Soviet Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Polish Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he fully understood. M. Molotov&apos;position, but he wished to state that of His Majesty&apos;s Government which wasgoverned by their engagement to the Polish Government. He repeated that in moscow he had been unable to agree to the Soviet demands, but that difficulty had now been got over. On the other hand, it was essential that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should keep their engagement to Poland which, indeed, placed no obstaclein the way of a direct Soviet-Polish Agreement. All that he wished to make clearwas that the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government remained as it was last July.He asked what was the Soviet Governments view now of their July Agreementwith the Polish Government ?M. MOLOTOV replied that it was the.same as it had been in July. In theirtreaty with Poland the Soviet Government had not guaranteed any frontier andthey had not concealed the fact that they claimed the 1941 frontier. Now, how-ever, they were agreeing that the question remained open. If Poland knew thatshe could expect compensation in German territory, a settlement would be much easier.THE SECRETARY OF STATE observed that the discussion had shownthat there was a certain amount of agreement. He recalled that in Moscow theSoviet Government had already made plain that they would leave open thequestion of the Soviet-Polish frontier. But they then asked His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to recognise their claim to certain other frontiers. To that HisMajesty&apos;s Government now agreed and he was therefore somewhat surprisedto find that the Soviet Government seemed to think that they were entitled toask some further concession of His Majesty&apos;s Government. He suggested that perhaps it might be better if he were to try to draft a reply to M. Molotov&apos;s draft letter.
M. MOLOTOV suggested that one form which this might take would besimply to take note of M. Moiotov&apos;s letter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that as he conceived it his reply might indicate that His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome friendly agreementbetween the Soviet and Poland; at the same time the reply would make it clearthat the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government was governed by existing arrange-ments.  He enquired what would be the objection to a reply on those lines.M. MOLOTOV said that it would be a one-sided action in favour of Poland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that that would not be his intention;he wished to see a Soviet-Polish Agreement. He would examine His Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ declaration of July last and would endeavour to draft a reply toM. Molotov&apos;s letter.Certain other points in Article 3 were then dealt with, and it was agreedthat the words in Article 3 of the Soviet draft: &apos;&apos; and to the interests of GreatBritain of the recovery of her European territory occupied by enemy forces &quot;should be omitted. Later in the same sentence the words &quot; in Europe &quot; and&quot; European &quot; were also suppressed and the latter word replaced by &quot; other.&quot;In regard to the second paragraph of Article 3, the SECRETARY OFSTATE enquired whether M. Molotov would agree to insert any reference to federation as had appeared in the Moscow draft.M. MOLOTOV agreed that this question had been discussed in Moscow.The Soviet Government had certain information to show that some federationsmight be directed against the Soviet Union. The question was one for the future and he thought it might be better to deal with it when it was raised in definiteform.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that His Majesty *s Government would never, of course, be parties to any scheme directed against the Soviet Union; thatwas the very opposite of their policy. They were only interested in the formationof federations as a defence against Germany.It was agreed to endeavour to find some form of words that would meet thispoint.The Meeting then adjourned.-J6
MOST SECRET. : Copy No. \TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.*THIRD MEETING WITH THE SOVIET DELEGATION AT10 DOWNING STREET AT 4 p.m. ON MAY 22, 1942.Present :Secretary of  State  for  Foreign M. Molotov.Affairs. M. Maisky.Sir Alexander Gadogan. M. Sobolev.Sir Orme Sargent. M. Pavlov.Brigadier Firebrace.THE SECRETARY OF STATE enquired whether M. Molotov had had time to study the draft reply to his draft letter which had been submitted tothe Soviet delegation that morning.M. MOLOTOV answered that, in his view, the draft reply did not improve the position.THE SECRETARY OF STATE explained that he was under a certainpledge to the Polish Government. The Soviet delegation would remember, thatthe British declaration of July last played a prominent part in-the..negotiation of the Soviet-Polish agreement. The Secretary of State was pledged to maintain in subsequent negotiations the position defined in that declaration. This pledgearose out of the agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Poland, whichin fact brought His Majesty&apos;s Government into the-war. That did not. mean that we should not welcome a direct Polish-Soviet agreement in regard to their common frontier, but we were bound to safeguard our.own position.M. MOLOTOV repeated that he thought there was room for improvement,and, on the Secretary of State enquiring in what direction that might be realised,M. Molotov suggested that it might be possible to go back to the Curzon line.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he had understood that theSoviet Government were agreed to leave the question of the Soviet-Polish frontieropen.M. MOLOTOV said that that was so, but that, if the British Governmentmaintained the position it.held in 1941, that would mean, that they were takingsides to the injury of Soviet interests. He proposed that the.question should; beleft open and he1 believed that this would be in;the interests of Poland,-as. thequestion could be settled on a friendly basis between Poland and the Soviet Union.THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that his draft reply wouldnot in any way exclude the possibility of a friendly direct settlement, whether on the basis of the Curzon line or on any other. The, intention was only to assurePoland that we still maintained the position which we held-at the time, of the signature of our Treaty.1 We could not do less than that, and we should not exclude any particular solution.* A meeting was held with the Soviet delegation on the,morning of May 22nd, at whichmilitary matters were discussed.   This will be dealt with in a separate series.11723-3   [23854-3]
M. MOLOTOV pointed out that the Secretary of State had indicated thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were now prepared to agree to the Soviet proposals with regard to the Baltic frontiers; but they were now putting difficulties inthe way of settling the Polish-Soviet frontier. That frontier extended over800 kilom. and, if Article III were left as it stood, that would mean that thatfrontier was left entirely in doubt.THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that the proposal to leaveopen the question of the Soviet-Polish frontier had been made not by him but bythe Soviet Government. The British declaration of July last did not decide anyfrontier question, and he himself had made it plain, in answer to a question inthe House of Commons, that Plis Majesty&apos;s Government did not guarantee anyfrontier. Their position was that, pending a settlement between Poland andthe Soviet Union, they did not propose either to guarantee or to advocate anyparticular frontier. All that they wished to do was to maintain the position which they took up.last July, which showed that they stood by the Anglo-Polishtreaty.   It must be observed that that treaty did not guarantee any frontiers.M. MOLOTOV said that, although the Soviet Government were prepared toleave the question for later decision, they wished to make it clear that the ultimate solution must not be at the expense of White Russia or the Ukraine. Anycompensation that were to be found for Poland must be at the expense ofGermany, who was the common.enemy. If a united view were held on this point,that could form the basis of an agreement.THE SECRETARY OF STATE observed that there was nothing in what. Molotov had said which was inconsistent with the terms of his draft letter.The British position was that until this frontier was settled by agreement, HisMajesty&apos;s Government were resolved to keep an open mind on the subject. But, ashe had already explained, the letter of July last did not deal specifically withfrontiers, but only with the general position arising out of the Anglo-Polishagreement.M. MOLOTOV said that if something on the lines of Mr. Eden&apos;s reply tothe Parliamentary Question could be included, that might afford a solution.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he must be frank. The Britishdeclaration of July last had played a large part in facilitating the conclusionof the Soviet-Polish treaty. He had consistently promised the Polish Governmentthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would maintain the position as defined in that declaration. The latter, however, did not exclude any direct settlement betweenthe Soviet and Poland on any basis. If, however, ail reference to the declarationwere now to be omitted, that would be regarded by the Poles as a betrayal of their position. Mr. Eden observed that his draft reply to M. Molotov&apos;s letter did not ask the latter to express agreement with the position of Plis Majesty&apos;sGovernment.M. MOLOTOV enquired whether the letter could not be confined to one point in the treaty. Could it not, for instance, say something on the lines that,while taking note of the statement contained in M. Molotov&apos;s letter concerningfrontiers, His Majesty&apos;s Government expressed the firm hope that the questionof the Soviet-Polish frontier would be settled between the two parties with due regard to the interests of each.THE SECRETARY OF STATE admitted that this might not be a badformula, but feared that the Polish Government might interpret it as anabandonment by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the treaty position. He would therefore like to add something to the effect that in the meanwhile the positionof His Majesty&apos;s Government had already been made plain in the declaration ofJuly last.M. MOLOTOV indicated that he would have difficulty in accepting this.THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that the Anglo-Polish treatydid not recognise Poland&apos;s old frontiers, nor did it recognise the frontiers of1939. It neither recognised the original frontiers nor the changes that had beensubsequently made in them.
M. MOLOTOV said that that was implied in his draft letter, and it seemedto him only necessary for the Secretary of State to take note of what was writtentherein. He added that it did not seem that progress was being made towardsagreement on Article III.It was agreed to examine the other Articles of the Treaty.THE SECRETARY OF STATE enquired whether M. Molotov had beenable to study a draft which he had sent him with a view to meeting the point about Confederations.M. MOLOTOV said that if agreement were reached on other points, hethought that it would not be difficult to agree upon the original Moscow text inthis respect, with certain small amendments, and he hoped that it might bepossible to find an agreeable text on the following day.M. MAI SKY read out a rough draft of what M. Molotov proposed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE suggested an alternative formula, and itwas agreed that there should not be any great difficulty in reaching agreement on a text.Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Soviet draft, corresponding with Articles 6, 7 and 3of the British draft, were agreed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that there remainedArticle IV of the British draft, which found no place in the Soviet draft. he recalled that the Prime Minister had explained yesterday that this had been inserted to meet an express request from President Roosevelt. The United states administration had expressed disapproval of the treaty, and it would help us with them, and with American opinion generally, if something of this kind couldbe inserted. His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves attached importance to this principle; for instance, if it were agreed eventually to transfer E. Prussia to poland, it would certainly be desirable that arrangements be made enabling theGerman population to be removed.&apos;M. MOLOTOV said that he quite agreed that this principle should beapplied in the case of E. Prussia, but he did not indicate that he could accept this Article in the treaty. He said that it introduced a new and complicatedquestion, and to include it in the treaty would encourage all kinds of propagandaon the part of dissatisfied elements.It was consequently agreed to leave this Article for further discussion.M. MOLOTOV then raised the question of the Protocol which the SovietGovernment proposed should accompany the treaty. He said that this was not anew question, but had been discussed in December last in Moscow. The SovietGovernment wished to insert in such a Protocol the minimum conditions neces-sary for safeguarding their security in those regions where they had been attacked by Hitler&apos;.s associates Finland and Roumania. They desired to preventthe possibility of any future aggressive combination of the kind. It was their intention that the pacts of mutual assistance would include a guarantee of theindependence of those countries. Great Britain might desire to take the samecourse in the interests of its own security as regards Belgium and Holland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he was not clear as to the natureof the proposed Protocol. Would it be secret? What, in fact, would it involve?Would it imply that His Majesty&apos;s Government gave their formal approval tothe proposed pacts of mutual assistance ?M. MOLOTOV replied that, in his view, it would be better if the Protocolcould be secret.THE SECRETARY OF STATE enquired again what it was to which HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be committed by this document.M. MOLOTOV said that, in the interests of the security of the U.S.S.R.,Finland and Roumania who had both broken their treaty engagements to theSoviet Government and had made war against the latter would be called uponto sign treaties which would in effect restore the position which existed beforeFinland and Roumania broke their engagements. That would involve a returnto the treaty between Finland and the TJ.S.S.R. of March 1940 and to the treaty between Roumania and the U.S.S.R. of June of the same year.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE observed that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor their part were not contemplating pacts with Belgium and Holland. It was still not clear to him how the proposed arrangement, which would in fact be a revival of previous arrangements, would be a matter in which British partieipa-tion would be required. Would it be possible for the Russian delegation tosubmit a rough draft of the Protocol which they had in mind ?M. MOLOTOV said that a Protocol was necessary in order to explain and give effect to the Article in the treaty which dealt with the interests of thesecurity of the Soviet Union and Great Britain. The Soviet government considered it necessary to insist on the restoration of previously existing treatiesin order to avoid the recurrence of events which took place in 1941. If theconclusion of treaties with Belgium and Holland did not interest His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, that of course was the affair of the latter. He agreed that it mightbe possible to submit a draft of the Protocol, but what interested him was theSecretary of State&apos;s attitude to this question, and he would like this explainedmore fully. He recalled that this question was raised in December last, when itwas discussed on broader lines. He asked, finally, whether the idea was accepted in principle.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said it Would be unnecessary for thedraft to include anything regarding Belgium and Holland. He said it would be easier for him if M. Molotov could submit a -draft in general terms, indicating the substance of the Articles which he would contemplate including in the protocol. He did not wish to bind him to any exact formula at the moment,but he would like only a general idea of the substance which he could submit tohis colleagues.M. MOLOTOV asked wherein lay the principal difficulty, to which theSECRETARY OF STATE replied that he was still not clear exactly what&apos; was asked of His Majesty&apos;s Government. He quite understood the position of theSoviet Government and what they were aiming at. but it was not clear to himwhat part His Majesty&apos;s Government could play in the matter.M. MOLOTOV referred to Article III of the treaty and said that the protocol wrould represent an endeavour to give effect to that Article.THE SECRETARY OF^ STATE said that he fully tinderstood that, buthe must confess that he was still not quite clear what part Flis Majesty&apos;s Govern-rnent were expected to play. He could understand that the Soviet government might require the revival of the previously existing treaties, but did they ask for more than that, and, if so. how much more did they require ?M. MOLOTOV said that the Protocol would indicate that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Soviet Government considered it necessary that the incle-pendence of Finland and Roumania should be guaranteed by the U.S.S.R. Itmight also mean that a similar arrangement could be contemplated as regardsGreat Britain and the Low Countries. He undertook to produce a rough draftof the Protocol.The meeting then adjourned.
MOST SECRET.Copy No. i 7TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.FOURTH MEETING WITH THE SOVIET DELEGATION, HELD INTHE FOREIGN OFFICE AT 3 p.m. ON MAY 23, 1942.Brigadier Firebrace.THE SECRETARY OF STATE recalled a suggestion that had beenmade to M. Molotov on the previous evening that, if it proved impossible to reach agreement on the present draft treaty, it might be possible to adopt an alternativeform of treaty. He was assured, from the course which the conversations hadalready taken, that the desire on both sides was to establish a whole-hearted-operation both during and after the war, and he himself would be very anxiousto see this fact recorded in a signed formal agreement,M. MOLOTOV asked if this alternative treaty was submitted instead ofthe treaty which had been under discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE confirmed that this was the intention,though he added that, of course, the conclusion of a treaty on such lines neednot exclude any subsequent agreement. He pointed out also that the new alter-native treaty included certain points which figured already in the treaty underdiscussion. Above all, the new alternative treaty contained the provision for a20-year pact of mutual assistance.M. MOLOTOV observed that a treaty of mutual assistance already existedbetween the two Governments, and enquired whether that was to be maintained.THE SECRETARY OF STATE replied that the existing treaty relatedonly to the war : the treaty which he had in mind would replace that treaty andwould run on after the conclusion of hostilities.It was suggested that the Soviet delegation might wish to have a short timeto themselves to examine the draft of the new alternative treaty, and the british delegation withdrew.On resuming, M. MOLOTOV said that, of course, he had only had time to read the draft through and it had been impossible for him to study it in all its implications. He was not therefore in a position to give an opinion on it at thepresent moment. He asked why it was desired to substitute this draft for thatwhich had been under discussion since last December.THE SECRETARY OF STATE explained that the reason for thesubstitution was that difficulties had been encountered in agreeing on the text of the former draft, particularly in regard to the Polish question and in regardto the British article 4.Present :Secretary of  State for ForeignM. Molotov.M. Maisky.M. Sobolev.M. Pavlov.Affairs.Sir Alexander Cadogan.Sir Orme Sargent.11723-4   [23854-4]b
The new alternative treaty was an attempt to place relations between thetwo countries on an abiding footing. We had for some time felt the need for anenduring basis of confidence, both now and after the war, and we thought thatthe proposed 20-year pact of mutual assistance would show that the two Govern-ments meant to work together for a generation at least. The treaty would not exclude, as he had said, agreement on any other points.M. MOLOTOV asked to be informed of the main differences between thenew alternative draft and the former draft.THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that the new draft intro-duced the idea of a 20-year pact of mutual assistance which could only be endedif a general system of security was set up with which both Governments were satisfied. At the same time he felt confident (though he had not consulted them)that the American administration would have no objection to the present draft,which would carry British co-operation with the Soviet Union into the after-wai-period, and which would ensure the continuance of joint precautions against german aggression.He believed that such a treaty would receive a very warm welcome here andin America, and indeed everywhere where there was a determination to preventthe recurrence of German aggression.Though the treaty admittedly did not deal with vexed questions such asfrontiers, it was obvious that if we were to offer a 20-year pact, it must be our desire that Russia, as our ally, be strong and secure.M. MOLOTOV said that this draft, with certain additions, could certainly be considered. He would report its terms to his Government, and on his returnto Moscow he would discuss it there. He thought it would be impossible todiscuss it with his Government from here by telegraph.He referred to the fact that there were a number of questions in the formerdraft treaty which had been left open : he would prefer to finish the discussionof these while leaving open the question of this new alternative treaty.THE SECRETARY OF STATE readily agreed to this proposal. His onlyreason for submitting the new alternative draft was that something like a deadlock seemed to have been reached on certain points of the other draft, andhe had wished to produce something on which both Governments could agree.That of course did not exclude a re-examination of certain points in the formerdraft, for which he was quite prepared.Taking the Soviet draft, M. MOLOTOV pointed out that the preamble andarticles 1 and 2 were agreed. As regards article 3, M. Molotov had communicatedto the Secretary of State a rough draft of the Protocol which would amplify thisarticle (Annex I).   Could Mr. Eden give his ideas on this draft of the Protocol&quot;?THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he had only just seen this draft and had been unable to study it carefully.   Was it intended to be secret 1M. MOLOTOV said that it would certainly be better to keep it secret, butif desired he could suggest publication to his Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that it would be difficult for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to-sign a secret Protocol: they had for some time nowexcluded such procedure from their diplomacy. On the other hand, he sawcertain difficulties in the way of publication on account of the reactions thatwould have to be anticipated in Finland and Roumania. So far as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were concerned, they would not wish to make any agreement as suggested in paragraph 3 of the draft Protocol.As regards the other two paragraphs, he was not quite sure of their meaning.Did they mean that as punishment for Finnish and Roumanian treachery, theSoviet Government must take certain guarantees against repetition for example,by maintaining troops in Finland and Roumania? It was not quite clear what other form of assistance could be expected from Finland and Roumania or whatthe Soviet Government had in mind.&apos; He would have to submit the draft to hiscolleagues in any case before giving a considered reply.M. MOLOTOV pointed out that the Protocol did not, in fact, constitute anew question.   It was a concrete proposal for ensuring security.   That had been
touched on already in the conversations in Moscow, and some time before his arrival in London the Soviet Ambassador had informed Mr. Eden of the soviet governments intentions in this respect.None the less, as he saw that this question caused His MajestyS Governmentsome difficulty, he would be prepared to drop the Protocol provided certain amendments were made in the text of the treaty.- He suggested that in article 3 of the Soviet draft the words &quot;of each&quot;should be deleted, and that after the word &quot; security &quot; there should be inserted the words &quot; of Great Britain, especially in the region of the Pas de Calais andthe southern part of the North Sea, and the security of the U.S.S.R., especiallyin the region of the Gulf of Finland and the north-western part of the black sea.&quot;   The text would then run on : &quot; as well as to the interests, &amp;c.&quot;. It was not necessary at this stage to put proposals in concrete form, butthe general intention of this phrase would be to afford security to Great Britainand the U.S.S.R, in the regions in which they were particularly interested.That was the intention, and the actual form in which effect could be given to theintention could be a subject for future consultation. The Soviet government felt that this point of security was so fundamental for both Governments thatthere could be no reason for any difference of opinion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he would have to study this text,but he would point out at once that the British position in respect of the Pas deCalais and the North Sea was not the same as that of the Soviet Union in theGulf of Finland and the Black Sea. Great Britain had not been attacked by herneighbours in the former region; whereas the Soviet Union had been aggressedby Finland and Roumania. He therefore thought it unnecessary to introduceany mention of the former region. He promised, however, to consider the matter.M. MOLOTOV then turned to point (a) of article 3. He proposed a returnto the Moscow draft: &quot; The safeguarding and strengthening of the economicand political independence of all European countries, either as unitary orfederated States,&quot; with the addition of the words &quot;on the basis of friendly relations towards the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE drew M. MolotovS attention to a variantwhich His MajestyS Government had suggested, namely &quot; (a) the safeguarding.and strengthening of the economic, military and political independence of all european countries and the encouragement of regional understandings and con-federations in suitable cases.&quot;It was decided to consider the adoption of this text with the addition ofthe words proposed by M. Molotov above.The Secretary of State made a suggestion in regard to point (b) of the samearticle, with the object of showing willingness to co-operate with the UnitedStates Government, who were directly interested in questions of relief and reconstruction. He asked M. Molotov to consider prefacing the words ofSection B with the words &quot; Full collaboration in inter-Allied plans of assistance for.&quot;M. MOLOTOV expressed his readiness to consider this point, adding thathe would prefer to delete the word &quot; full.&quot;After observing that the Soviet articles 4, 5 and 6 had been agreed,M. Molotov turned to the British draft article 4 regarding the transfer ofpopulations. This raised a new question, and he would prefer that it should notfigure in the treaty itself, though it could doubtless be discussed apart from thetreaty.THE SECRETARY OF STATE referred to the fact that the PrimeMinister had already explained to M. Molotov the origin of this article, whichwas, indeed, a suggestion made by President Roosevelt himself. He mustfrankly say that the Cabinet attached great importance to it. If the actual text-caused any difficulty, he would willingly consider any modification. If the newalternative draft were to be adopted there would be no need for an article ofthis kind, but in any treaty dealing with frontier questions he was sure that HisMaiestyS Government would require something on these lines.M. MOLOTOV said that he had already explained the attitude of theSoviet Government in this matter.   An article on these lines would inevitably[23854-4] b 2 &apos;
incite the inhabitants of the &quot;territories in question to make claims against theSoviet Government. He suggested that it might be possible to find a rather more restricted formula, and he would be prepared to make a proposal to that effect.He did not consider that any real difficulties would arise even if no such articlewere included in the treaty. If, for instance, a Pole wished to leave Lithuaniafor Poland, no objection would be raised by the Soviet Government. In pointof fact, he did not think, that such cases would arise, but if it were consideredimportant from the point of view of American public opinion, it might bepossible to find a more restricted formula.THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that the British draft wasnot very far-reaching. It only recognised the desirability of making appropriateprovision in the eventual peace settlement. It therefore hardly amounted to muchmore than a pious hope.M. MOLOTOV said that his idea would be to insert the words &quot; as far aspossible&apos;&apos; after the word &quot;ensure,&quot; and after the words &quot;such territories&quot;insert the words &quot;belonging to national minorities.&quot;In reply to a question by the Secretary of State as to the exact significance of the words &quot;national minorities,&quot; M. Molotov pointed out that there were,for example, in Lithuania not a few Poles. Poland would be restored, butLithuania would be incorporated in the Soviet Union. It might therefore bethat a Pole in Lithuania might wish to move into Poland. Such a Pole inLithuania would belong to a minority, and there would be no objection to hismoving. The Soviet Government could therefore agree to the article amended ashe had proposed. He admitted that the amendments certainly restricted themeaning of the article.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he was still not quite clear asto the scope of the article : supposing part of Finland were to go back into theSoviet Union, would Finns be allowed to leave that part and return to Finlandproper 1M. MOLOTOV said that he only claimed the restoration of the Russo-Finnish Treaty, according to which a part of Finland was incorporated in theSoviet Union. As the Finnish army went back out of that part, the army itselfforcibly evacuated all Finns. The question therefore did not arise as regardsFinland.   Any minority nationals would of course be allowed to leave.THE SECRETARY OF STATE enquired how the article would beapplied in the case of Bessarabia. As he understood it, any member of a minority, for example a Pole in Lithuania, could leave the country, but aLithuanian would not be allowed to do so. This constituted a very severe restric-tion on the scope of the British article, and he could only submit it to hiscolleagues.The Secretary of State observed that there remained the question of thedraft letter concerning the Polish frontier.M. MOLOTOV said that that presented the greatest difficulty, and he wouldlike to reflect upon it further and resume discussion perhaps to-morrow.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that future procedure would depend to some extent on M. Molotov&apos;s plans. The Prime Minister had sent a message to M. Stalin, the text of which he gave to M. Molotov, expressing the hope thatM. Molotov might return from America via England. If this were agreed, thatwould give time for us to work in the interval for an agreement on these texts.The alternative would be for M. Molotov to prolong his stay here for a few days,though there might be some advantage perhaps in his going to America first.M. MOLOTOV said that his instructions on leaving Moscow were to cometo England and to spend a few days here in order to finish the treaty negotiations.He was then to proceed to America to complete discussion of the questions whichhad to be dealt with there. He himself would much prefer to complete the treatydiscussions here in London if possible, and, if it were necessary for that purpose,he would be willing to stay a day or two longer.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that, whether agreement were possibleor not, he himself and he knew he could say the same on behalf of the PrimeMinister was very grateful for the manner in which M. Molotov had conductedthese discussions.
M. MOLOTOV said that he had been extremely glad to meet the PrimeMinister and leading personalities in London, and expressed gratitude for hisreception here.It was finally agreed that both sides would consider the various suggestions which had been made in the course of to-day&apos;s discussion and see whether theycould make any proposals for overcoming the main outstanding difficulty inregard to Poland. If either side desired it, they could ask for a meeting on thefollowing day, which could be arranged at short notice.ANNEX I.Draft Protocol proposed by M. Molotov regarding Finland and Roumania.Supplementary Protocol to the Treaty between the U.S.S.R. and Great britain for the solution of post-war questions and for their joint actions to evLSuresecurity in Etirope after the conclusion of the war with Germany and her allies in Europe.THE parties to the above-mentioned treaty signed this day think it necessaryto define the provisions of article 3 of the treaty in question, and have agreed onthe following in the interests of the security of the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain  (1) In view of the fact that Finland broke the treaty of peace with theSoviet Union, signed by her. on the 12th March, 1940, took part together withGermany in a faith-breaking attack on the U.S.S.R., rejected the peacefulproposals of the Government of the U.S.S.R, in the summer of 1941 for the cessation of hostilities and remained in the Hitlerite camp to continue heraggressive policy, it is recognised as essential, in addition to the re-establishment in full force of the provisions of the treaty of the 12th March, 1940, that theSoviet Union and Finland, for the purpose of ensuring the security of both countries and of averting during the post-war period a breaking of the peace onthe part of Germany in that part.of Europe, should conclude between themselves a treaty of mutual assistance with a guarantee of the independence of Finland.(2) In view of the fact that Roumania broke the frontiers agreement betweenthe U.S.S.R. and Roumania, laid down in an exchange of notes between theSoviet and Roumanian Governments on the 27th and 28th June, 1940, and took part together with Germany in a faith-breaking attack on the U.S.S.R., it is recognised as essential, in addition to the re-establishment of the Soviet-Roumanian frontiers, in conformity with the above-mentioned agreement, thatthe Soviet Union and Roumania, for the purpose of ensuring the security of both countries, and of averting during the post-war period a breaking of the peace by Germany in that part of Europe, should conclude between themselves a treatyof mutual assistance with a guarantee of the independence of Roumania.(3) For the purpose of creating guarantees of the independence of belgium and Holland and also of ensuring the security of Great Britain, Belgium and holland recognise that it is necessary for treaties of mutual assistance to be concluded between Great Britain and each of the States in question.

HELD  ATTHE   FOREIGN  OFFICE  AT  4  p.m.   ON  MAY  24,   1942.Brigadier Firebrace.M. MOLOTOV said that he had been considering the draft of the proposed reply from the Secretary of State to his letter concerning the Polish frontier.He found that this draft was rather too full and gave expression only to the-British point of view. He suggested that at least it would be preferable if mr. Eden could in his letter, in addition to what appeared therein already,include a reference to his answer to a question in the House of Commons. Hewould be prepared to let Mr. Eden&apos;s draft stand provided there were added to itthe words &quot; as well as in my statement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the House of Commons on the same day, to the effect that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have not guaranteed any frontiers in Eastern Europe.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that in the original draft ofhis letter there was an indication of the effect of our July declaration. that had been suppressed. Consequently he would not like, in the addition proposedby M. Molotov, to indicate the effect of his answer in the House of Commons.He would not mind a simple reference to his statement in Parliament, in thesame way that the draft contained a simple reference to the July declaration.M. MOLOTOV indicated that he did not object to this solution, and THESECRETARY OF STATE undertook to discuss&apos;it with his colleagues.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then turned to the text of Article 3, andobserved that the question at issue was whether there should be inserted in thisArticle something to take the place of the Protocol. He referred to the words-&quot;of the security of Great Britain, especially in the region of the Straits ofDover and the southern part of the North Sea, and of the security of theU.S.S.R., especially in the region of the Gulf of Finland and the north-westernpart of the Black Sea.&quot;The Secretary of State said that he saw great difficulty in this proposal..He would inevitably be asked what this formula meant. Did it, for instance,involve military occupation of those territories in any form ? It seemed to beopen, even more than the passage dealing with frontiers, to the objection thatwe were attempting to make a peace settlement in one part only of Europe, inadvance of a general settlement, with all the difficulties that that would involvewith our own public opinion and that of the United States.Present :Secretary of  State  for  ForeignAffairs.Sir Alexander Cadogan.Sir Orme Sargent.M. Molotov.M. Maisky.M. Sobolev.M. Pavlov.11723-5   f23854-5]
The Secretary of State begged M. Moiotov to look again at the new alternativedraft treaty which he had submitted to him yesterday, and which actually madea bigger offer than His Majesty&apos;s Government had ever made in the course of history. It was an offer which they could make now, and an agreement on those lines could be signed now and no one in the world could have the slightest grounds for objection. It would be a buttress of the future peace of Europe and wouldnot exclude discussion between us as allies, not only of the problems presented by Finland and Roumania, but of the future map of Europe and the economic problems of the post-war period. The treaty which he had offered would afford a strong foundation on which lasting friendship between the two countries couldbe built.Most of the Articles in that alternative treaty were really already familiar.The only new element was the offer of a 20-year pact of mutual assistance,but the draft treaty did avoid at the present time those controversial issues, thediscussion of which could only do harm to the common allied front. The PrimeMinister had already explained to M. Moiotov the American point of view, andMr. Winant himself a strong advocate, as M. Molotov knew, of Anglo-Soviet-United States co-operation and who went to the United States to try in his privatecapacity to improve the prospects of our treaty had himself impressed upon him the risks attendant on the signature of such a treaty to relations between our countries. He was sure that those risks would be accentuated by the references to Finland and Roumania, which were now by implication to be inserted inArticle 3. On the other hand, if the alternative treaty&apos; were signed, these difficulties would not arise now7. There would be no trouble with the PolishGovernment, and M. Molotov could go to the United States with a sure knowledge that we had done something important to improve the relations between our twocountries without damaging those with the United States.The Secretary of State therefore begged M. Molotov to consider whether he could not submit the text of the new7 treaty to Moscow7 for immediate consideration. He knew that the Prime Minister earnestly hoped for a solution-on those lines.M. MOLOTOV admitted that the new treaty was of great interest, and hepromised to report on it on his return to Moscow. It did, how7ever, raise anentirely new7 question, and he could not agree upon it now. At the present stagehe thought we should finish the consideration of the existing drafts a con-sideration which had already been made easier by concessions on both sides.He thought that there was a certain misunderstanding, as Mr. Eden had referred to Russian security interests in Finland. What he had referred to was their interests in the Finnish Gulf. Leningrad itself stood on the Finnish Gulf,as also Estonia. There was also the question of Hango and the islands whichhad been leased to the Soviet by Finland in the Treaty of 1940. If other conditionsw7ere to be desired of Finland, that would be a matter for the future, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be kept closely informed.As regards Roumania, M. Molotov pointed out that the expression whichhe used in the passage which he wished to insert in Article 3 was &quot; the north-western part of the Black Sea.&quot; In this region the mouths of the Danubewere of great importance to the Soviet Union. He stated that there was noquestion of military occupation, but he would like it recognised that the soviet union had special interests in the north-western parts of the Black Sea. war was being waged in those regions against the Soviet Union, and the questionseemed to him to be one of elementary importance.As regards American opinion, &quot;he believed there was no foundation forsaying that this treaty would be disapproved there. There were friendlyelements in America who would certainly not raise any objection to it.THE SECRETARY OF. STATE said that he wished to emphasise one point about the new alternative treaty, and that was that it was not as new asit appeared. The only new conception in it was that of a 20-year pact of mutual assistance, which certainly was a most important point. All the other articles w7ere taken from existing drafts.As regards American opinion of the treaty which we were discussing, hewas afraid it was unfortunately not true that friendly elements would be infavour of it.   There could be no more friendly elements in America than
President Roosevelt himself, Mr. Hull and Mr. Welles, who had all of themexpressed concern.As regards the proposed insertion in paragraph 3, the Secretary of state said he would have thought that a direct reference to Roumania might be lessalarming to some other countries than so vague an expression as &apos;&apos; the north-western parts of the Black Sea.&quot; For instance, Turkey might interpret this as applying even to Bulgaria : but he did not wish to press that distinction.M. MOLOTOV said that he would agree to either expression. There could,of course, be no question of Bulgaria being indicated, as Bulgaria was not inthe north-western parts of the Black Sea.Referring to what Mr. Eden had said about opinion in America, M. Molotovsaid that if we could reach agreement here he would, during his forthcoming visit to the United States, take upon himself all the responsibility for explaining to Americans what an excellent achievement this was.THE SECRETARY OF STATE. said that he was still not quite clear what the proposed Soviet insertion would add to the old draft, which, after all, covered the question of Estonia and the position in the Gulf of Finland;nor what it would add in regard to the position in the north-western parts ofthe Black Sea. He would have to explain to his colleagues the exact significance of this insertion, and he was at a loss to know how he would do this. What,in fact, did the Soviet Union intend? Did they intend to have bases in thoseregions, or any form of military occupation ?M. MOLOTOV replied that the various questions relating to the gulf of Finland would not be fully covered without this insertion. Fur instance,in the ease of Hango, that was not a question of frontier changes. Hango would remain in Finnish territory, but the lease accorded to the Soviet Uniou wouldbe restored.As regards Roumania, he would explain that there was no question of occupying any part of Roumania. It was a question of guaranteeing Roumania&apos;independence. Such a guarantee had already figured in the Soviet-RoumanianPact, Before the war the Soviet Union had a pact of mutual assistance with france, and France did not thereby become dependent on the Soviet Union.There had never been any question of the occupation of any part of France.He did not wish to lay down now the terms of any Pact with Roumania, butin any case they could not in any way injure British interests. It must beremembered that Hitler, in his attack upon the Soviet Union, had obtained help from Roumania, and therefore if only in general terms the present treaty should recognise the interests of the Soviet Union from the point of view oftheir security. If the treaty they were discussing could be signed, it would givefavourable prospects and a good basis for the new alternative draft which theSecretary of State had proposed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE thanked M. Molotov for his explanationand suggested that the time had come to define the points still outstanding onwhich he would have to consult his colleagues. He would only urge again thatthe new alternative treaty which he had proposed was a good document whichhe recommended to the serious attention of the Soviet Government.M. MOLOTOV agreed that the new alternative treaty would deserve themost serious consideration.THE SECRETARY OF STATE observed that the preamble and para-graphs 1 and 2 had already been agreed and it was now clear what the SovietGovernment desired for the first paragraph Of Article 3. There remained thesecond part of Article 3.It was agreed that this should read : &quot; The objectives of the High Contracting Parties in the work of reconstruction included, in particular &quot; (a) the safeguarding and strengthening of the economic, militaryand political independence of all European countries. This shouldbe done in suitable cases by means of regional understandings andconfederations on the basis of friendly relations towards the U.S.S.R.and Great Britain;
&quot; (b) full collaboration in inter-Allied plans of assistance for thereconstruction of the industrial and economic life of the countriesoccupied by Germany and her European allies.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that the addition which the    (g$Soviet delegation had proposed in Article 4 would have the effect of that Articlenot serving the purpose for which it had been inserted.M. MOLOTOV said that it would still do so to some extent, but theSECRETARY7 OF STATE maintained that this would only be to a small extent.It was agreed to omit the words &quot; without hindrance.&quot;Note was taken that Articles 5, 6 and 7 were agreed.With regard to the draft note from the Soviet Plenipotentiary to Mr. Eden,M. MAISKY7 indicated that the end of the last sentence should run : &quot; settled by mutual agreement between the two countries, in the spirit of friendly alliedrelations.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he thought the draft reply tothe Soviet Plenipotentiary should, after the first paragraph, include a furtherparagraph expressing appreciation of the desire of the Soviet Government for a friendly understanding with Poland, and he would submit a draft in due course.In regard to M. Molotov&apos;s draft note, he pointed out that reference wasmade in the last paragraph to a special agreement between the Polish and theSoviet Governments. His Majesty&apos;s Government were not fully acquainted withthis agreement, and he enquired&quot; whether M. Molotov could give any furtherinformation on the subject.M. MOLOTOV said that this referred to an agreement reached in thecourse of a conversation between M. Stalin and General Sikorski in Moscowlast year.It was agreed to insert at the end of the penultimate sentence the words&quot; during the latter&apos;s visit to Moscow in November-December 1941.&quot;THE secretary  OF STATE undertook to consult his colleagues onthe following day. and to meet M. Molotov again thereafter.

MOLOTOV said that he had informed his Government of the termsof the new alternative treaty and had reported that Mr. Eden had considered it would be more suitable and correct to adopt a treaty on these lines rather thancontinue discussion of the former drafts. He had reported that the PrimeMinister was also in favour of this course. Moreover, he had told his Governmentthat, according to the information at the disposal of the Prime Minister andthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the United States Government and president Roosevelt himself would favour the new draft and would deprecate atreaty containing the controversial points which had already caused difficulty.M. Molotov added that he had had a. conversation yesterday with Mr. Winant,who had confirmed that President Roosevelt&apos;s opinion was as indicated.M. Molotov said that he had reported his own opinion that the new treaty would have great importance both for the period of the war and for the period after the war, and he had asked for instructions with regard to it.One difficulty was that in the case of treaties of such political importance,they had to be considered not only by the Soviet Government, but also by thePresidium of the Supreme Council of the U.S.S.R. sitting under PresidentKalinin, with the participation of M. Stalin. The Presidium included certain members who were not always in Moscow, and it might take a little time toconvoke them. He had not yet had final instructions concerning the new treaty,but he hoped that he might receive these either to-night or to-morrow morning.Meanwhile, he was ready to proceed to a discussion of the draft. As this draftincluded a number of points on which agreement had already been reached in thecourse of discussions, he hoped that the further discussion necessary would not bevery prolonged. There were points in the draft that were new to him, and hewould beg leave to ask for certain explanations.THE SECRETARY OF STATE thanked M. Molotov very warmly for thepatience and understanding which he had shown in the discussion of thedifficulties which were inevitable, especially having regard to opinion in theUnited States.He had not the least doubt himself that the new draft could be an infinitelymore valuable instrument for promoting unity between our two governments and thus assisting the effective prosecution of the war.   He had told the Prime11723-6   [23854-6]Present:Secretary of State for ForeignM. Molotov.M. Maisky.M. Sobolov.M. Pavlov.Affairs.Sir Alexander Cadogan.Mr. Richard Law, M.P.
Minister last night of the message which he had received from M. Maisky, andhe knew that the views which he was expressing were entirely those of thePrime Minister also.He was, of course, entirely at M. Molotov&apos;s disposal and ready to give anyexplanations that might be required.There was one further matter. It would have been very difficult, in view ofwhat we knew of the attitude of the United States, to have signed the treatyhitherto under discussion before M. Molotov started for America, and, indeed,1 itwould have been very unwise to do so. No such difficulty, of course, arose inthe case of the present treaty, and for our part we were ready to sign wheneverit might suit M. Molotov, if and when he received his instructions. He would add that we were, of course, none the less anxious that M. Molotov should visitEngland again on his return journey.M. MOLOTOV said that his visit had already been rather prolonged, buthe hoped that this time there would not be any difficulties. He would restricthimself to proposing the minimum changes which might appear necessary.M. Molotov said that he proposed to leave consideration of the preambleuntil the Articles had been disposed of.In Article 1 he suggested that the words &apos;&apos; between the United Kingdom andthe U.S.S.B.&quot; should be substituted for the words &quot; between them.&quot;This was agreed.M. MOLOTOV had no question in regard to Article 2.As regards Article 3, he asked for an explanation of the word &quot; associate.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE said the idea was that ultimately some formof international order would be established. The United Kingdom and theU.S.S.R. might be willing to play their part in that, as well as, of course, theUnited States and smaller Powers. The first part of this Article 3 dealt withthe situation which we should like eventually to see, but we must bear in mind that it might take a long time to come about. Until that happened, the second part of this Article would be operative.M. MOLOTOV also asked for an explanation of the words &quot; like-minded.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that a short definition might be&quot; non-gangster.&quot;M. MOLOTOV suggested that in the second part of this Article somethingshould be inserted to show that it was intended to operate in the after-war period.THE SECRETARY OF STATE suggested that it might be well to addafter the words &quot;in their power&quot; the words &quot;after the termination ofhostilities.&quot;On further examination, it was agreed that it might be better to introducethis idea into the first part of the Article and to insert the words &apos;&apos; in the period after the war &quot; after the words &quot; common action.&quot;M. MOLOTOV made a somewhat similar suggestion in regard to Article 4,and it was agreed that the beginning of this Article should run : &apos;&apos; Should one ofthe High Contracting Parties after the termination of the present hostilitiesagain become involved.&quot;In regard to the second part of Article 4, M. Molotov asked who would decidewhen the time had arrived for this treaty to be superseded by a general system of security.THE SECRETARY OF STATE indicated that, in his view, both parties would have to be agreed on this point.M. MOLOTOV declared himself satisfied with this reply, and said thatdoubtless a formula could easily be found to express it.M. Molotov suggested that some phrase concerning the interests of securityof both signatories should be introduced into Article 5.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he would have no objection, andit was agreed that a formula should be sought for this.Finally, M. MOLOTOV suggested that the last word of Article 5 should be&quot; States &quot; instead of &quot; peoples.&quot;
Those were all the points which M. Molotov wished to raise on the Articlesof the draft. He would leave the preamble until he had received his instructions,but he did not anticipate that any great changes would be required in the preamble.He suggested that an appropriate title should be devised for the treaty.M. Molotov promised to inform the Secretary of State by telephone as soonas he received his instructions. If no fresh difficulties arose, he hoped that itmight be possible to conclude the business to-morrow.THE SECRETARY OE STATE reminded M. Molotov that they were bothpledged to inform the Turkish Government before signature took place, and hesuggested that it might be possible for them both to see the Turkish Ambassadortogether.To this M. MOLOTOV agreed.

HELDAT THE FOREIGN OFFICE AT 3-30 p.m. ON JUNE 9. 1942.(&apos;)Present:Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, j M. Molotov.Sir Alexander Cadogan. M. Maisky.Sir Orme Sargent, M. Sobolov.Brigadier Firebrace. j M. Pavlov.Supplies Protocol.M. MOLOTOV said he would like to examine the question of a new SuppliesProtocol.THE SECRETARY OF STATE suggested that it should be discussed withthe Prime Minister that evening.Communique.THE SECRETARY OF STATE suggested that they should now considerthe communique to be issued on the London visit. A text had been prepared andwas read out. Mr. Eden explained that it had been drafted before he had seen the communique prepared in Washington. It must clearly be brought into line with the latter, and he undertook that this should now be done and a furtherdraft shown to M. Molotov that evening.It was agreed that there must be two communiques : one dealing with theWashington visit and one with the London visit, since the nature of the talks in the two capitals had been different, inasmuch as a treaty had been concluded in London and there had been none concluded in Washington.It would also be necessary to bring into the London communique some reference to the British plans for this year, since it would seem curious if theonly reference to action in 1942 were to be found in the Washington communique,seeing that the Americans, with the best will in the world, cannot do much in 1942.M. MOLOTOV agreed that these modifications would be necessary.THE SECRETARY OF STATE explained that we had no objection tothe reference to action in 1942 which appeared in the Washington communique,since it might be useful as a means of worrying and deceiving the Germans.M. MOLOTOV hoped this might be the case, but said that, on the other hand,there must be no deception between friends.THE SECRETARY OF STATE promised that there should be none.M. MOLOTOV pointed out that in the Washington communique mentionwas made of discussions with United States military advisers.   There should(!) A Meeting was held with the Soviet Delegation on the morning of 9th June, at whichmilitary matters were discussed.11723-7   [23854-7] B
in the London communique be reference to similar discussions with british military advisers. Mention should also be made in the London communique ofthe speeding up of the despatch of war materials, since this appeared in theWashington communique.THE SECRETARY OF STATE asked when M. Molotov would proposethat publication should take place.M. MOLOTOV replied that he did not know when he would be able to getaway, but if he were able to leave as planned publication could take place onFriday morning. In any case we should prepare all the documents so as to beready for release on that date.THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that publication would haveto be simultaneous in all three capitals.M. MOLOTOV said that he had promised to inform Washington 12 hoursbefore publication. He suggested that the documents for publication should be : (1) The London communique.(2) The Treaty.(3) Speeches delivered at the signature.(4) Telegrams exchanged between The King and M. Kalinin.(5) The Washington communique (see Annex I).THE SECRETARY OF STATE agreed to this list.He proposed Thursday as the date for publication, since he would like toinform the House of Commons before it rose.  Failing Thursday, he would prefer to postpone publication until Tuesday, when the House of Commons would again 3be sitting.M. MOLOTOV demurred to postponement for a further week.   Was itreally necessary that the first announcement should be made in Parliament %THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that this would certainly be preferable.He suggested that if publication took place on Thursday this might deceive theenemy into thinking that M. Molotov had already returned to Moscow.M. MOLOTOV agreed to publication on Thursday and to an announcement in Parliament on that day. He stipulated, however, that there should be nowireless release until Friday morning.. THE SECRETARY OF STATE objected that after the announcement inParliament it would be impossible to maintain further secrecy.M. MAISKY urged that by using the censorship we could prevent journalistsand the B.B.C. from giving out the news until the next morning.Mr. RIDSDALE. who was called in at this point for consultation, expressedthe view that it would be impossible to prevent the B.B.C. from dealing with thesubject in their 9 o&apos;clock news.THE SECRETARY OF STATE proposed that the release should become-ordinated with the United States Government so as to take place at 9 o&apos;clockon. Thursday evening. Meanwhile he would, in his statement to the House ofCommons have indicated that M. Molotov was already back in Moscow.M. MOLOTOV said he would like to think the matter over and postpone adecision on this point until to-morrow morning.Radio-Telephone Service between this Country and the Soviet Union.M. MOLOTOV said he had been asked by his Government to raise thequestion of establishing a radio-telephone service between this country and theSoviet Union. Conversations were already proceeding for such a service betweenthe United States and the Soviet Union.THE SECRETARY OF STATE undertook to look into the matter. &apos;Hewould either discuss it with M. Molotov or put M. Maisky into touch with theappropriate Government department.
Meeting between M. Mqlotov and General Sikorski.THE SECRETARY OF STATE explained that he had told General Sikorskiabout the Treaty and that the General had expressed himself as pleased and asanxious to work on the most friendly terms possible with the Soviet Government.The General hoped, moreover, to have an opportunity of meeting M. Molotovwhile he was here, and Mr. Eden considered that in the circumstances such ameeting would be most desirable. Mr. Eden offered to arrange a lunch at which m. Molotov could meet the General.M. MOLOTOV agreed that a meeting with the General would be desirable,and it was eventually decided that it should be left to General Sikorski to saywTiether he wrould like the meeting to take place on the occasion of a lunch to begiven by the Secretary of State, or whether he would prefer to meet M. Molotovtete-a-tete at the Soviet Embassy.China.THE SECRETARY OF STATE gave M. Molotov two aide-memoire, onedealing with the question of improving our communications with China, and theother relating to the British Consulate-General at Kashgar. The subject matter was not discussed in either case.   (See Annexes II and III.)British Consulates in the Soviet Union.TFIE SECRETARY OF STATE gave M. Molotov an aide-memoire on thissubject, and added that if the Soviet Government wrere ready to allow us toestablish Consulates in the Soviet Union the places %vhere we would like to have.British Consulates would be Tiflis, Baku, Archangel and Vladivostok. Weshould, of course, be ready in return to allow the Soviet Government to openConsulates in the British Empire.   (See Annex IV.)M. MOLOTOV replied that a decision by the Soviet Government existednot to increase the number of consulates in the Soviet Union, but the request thatMr. Eden had now made would be examined.Proposed Treaty between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said he proposed to be indiscreet and totell M. Molotov that the Yugoslav Government had informed him that they wereconcluding a treaty with the Soviet Government. Mr. Eden so far had notexpressed any views to the Yugoslav Government on the matter, as he had wishedto consult M. Molotov on the subject first. It might be a pity if the Soviet Govern-ment&apos;s treaty with us were to be followed so quickly by another one.M. MOLOTOV did not see why there should be any objection to the SovietGovernment negotiating a treaty with Yugoslavia.THE SECRETARY OF STATE explained that it might make difficulties for us, since we had declined last year to conclude a mutual assistance treaty with Greece during the war. Fie recognised that eventually it might be foundadvisable that we should both make such treaties, but what wras important wasthat both of us should keep in step with one another in these matters. Mr. Edendid not want to enter into a treaty-making race with M. Molotov..M. MOLOTOV explained that the Yugoslav Government had asked for the ratification of the treaty signed last year or the negotiation of a new- treatydirected against Germany. It would be difficult for the Soviet Government torefuse to promise assistance to Yugoslavia in the wrar.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said he had no objection to such a treaty,but what made him apprehensive was that if the Soviet Government signed atreaty covering the post-war period, both the British and the Soviet Governmentwould be asked by other lesser Allies to sign similar treaties, and they would getinvolved in a whole network of treaties before the peace settlement,M. MOLOTOV, after referring to their treaties with Poland and Czecho-slovakia, pointed out that their original treaty with Yugoslavia negotiated last[23854-7] b 2
year just before the German attack on Yugoslavia, had had a very great effect onthe decisions then taken by Germany. It had made Hitler extremely angry andhad thus been one of the contributing causes which subsequently brought theSoviet Union into the war.THE SECRETARY OF STATE explained that what worried him aboutthe treaty now proposed was that, unlike its predecessor, it covered the post-war period.  It would be the first of such treaties.M. MOLOTOV asked whether Mr. Eden objected to the Soviet Governmentundertaking to restore the Yugoslav frontiers.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he did not. What he did wantwas that they should both keep their hands free as regards the lesser Allies, sothat they should not be committed when they had to deal with the future of thesecountries at the peace settlement. What he would like to see would be a self-denying ordinance between the British and Soviet Governments not to concludeduring the war any treaty covering the post-war period.M. MOLOTOV said that his Government was ready to support Yugoslavia^claim to the restoration of her frontiers and even to their extension at the expenseof Italy.THE SECRETARY OF STATE, while not demurring to this, said he would prefer that the British and Soviet Governments should agree on their policy asto the smaller States before entering into agreements with any of them.M. MOLOTOV asked whether, that being so, Mr. Eden would prefer thatthe Soviet Government should in this case limit themselves to a protocol merelyratifying and bringing up to date the original treaty with Yugoslavia.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that this was so. It was the applica-tion of the treaty to the postwar period which worried him. To take an instanceof the sort of difficulty into which post-war agreements at this stage with thesmaller Allies might land us, he instanced the case of the Greek Government,who ardently desired to annex the Dodecanese; whereas M. Stalin probably hadother views on this matter. This showed how desirable it was that the Britishand Soviet Governments should be in agreement between themselves beforecommitting themselves to the smaller Allies.M. MOLOTOV asked whether Mr. Eden would have any objection if theSoviet Government signed a protocol or a new treaty wherein the Soviet Govern-ment undertook to guarantee Yugoslavia^ frontiers.THE SECRETARY OF-STATE said he would have no objection, but thetreaty which had now been proposed to the Yugoslav Government provided, he understood, for mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia for aperiod of five years.M. MOLOTOV gathered that Mr. Eden would like an understanding betweenthe Soviet and British Governments that they would discuss and reach agreementbetween themselves before they concluded any treaty with any of the smallerAllies.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that this was his view.M. MOLOTOV said he would report the matter to his Government.Visits of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to Moscow.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said he would be grateful if facilities could be given to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to visit Moscow from time to time.M. MOLOTOV said certainly this could be done. In any case, he hoped thatthe headquarters of the Embassy would not remain in Kuibyshev much longer. in asking the Ambassador to move to Kuibyshev there had, of course, been no ideaof discrimination against the British Embassy. Meanwhile, the ambassador was at liberty to pay visits to Moscow whenever he wished.
ANNEX LStatement concerning the Visit of the People&apos;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs ofthe U.S.S.R., M. V. M. Molotov, to Washington.THE People&apos;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet socialist republics, M. V. M. Molotov, following the invitation of the President of theUnited States of America, arrived in Washington on the 29th May and was forsome time the Presidents guest. This visit to Washington afforded an oppor-tunity for a friendly exchange of views between the President and his advisers,on the one hand, and M. V. M. Molotov and his party, on the other. Among thosewho participated in the conversations were the Soviet Ambassador in the UnitedStates, M. Maxim Eitviniv, Mr. Harry Hopkins, Chief of Staff of the UnitedStates Army, General George C. Marshall, and Commander-in-Chief of theUnited States Fleet, Admiral Ernest J. King. Mr. Cordell Hull, Secretary ofState, joined in subsequent conversations on non-military matters.In the course of the conversations full understanding was reached withregard to the urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942. Inaddition, the measures for increasing and speeding up of the supplies of planes,tanks and other kinds of war materials from the United States to the soviet union were discussed. Further were discussed the fundamental problems ofco-operation of the Soviet Union and the United States in safeguarding peace and security to the freedom-loving peoples after the war. Both sides state with satisfaction the unity of their views on all these questions.At the conclusion of the visit the President asked M. Molotov to informM. Stalin, on his behalf, that he feels that these conversations have been most useful in establishing a basis for fruitful and closer relationship between the twoGovernments in the pursuit of the common objectives of the United Nations.ANNEX II.WITH the severance of all road communication between China and India/Burma, the only contact between China and the outside world, except for a singlerather tenuous air line between Calcutta and Chungking, is now via the U.S.S.R.Various proposals for road and air routes via the U.S.S.R. are underdiscussion with the Soviet Government. The most important of these are for(a) a route from Bandar Shahpur via the Persian railway to Bandar Shah onthe Caspian Sea; thence by Soviet ships to Krasnovodsk; thence by railway toAlma Ata; and thence by road and air to Chungking; (&amp;) a commercial airservice on the route Chungking-Lanchow-Hami-Alma Ata to connect with theSoviet communication system, with possibly a link from Alma Ata to Tehran,which is already connected by air with Cairo.The Chinese Government have, it is understood, made representations to theSoviet Government, and these have been supported by His Majesty&apos;s Government.So far as the trans-Persian railway is concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government donot anticipate much difficulty in making room for small Chinese consignmentswithout interfering with Soviet supplies, but it is understood that the question ofonward transport in Soviet territory presents some difficulties.The Soviet Government will no doubt agree that the development of newchannels of communication with China is essential both in order to supply Chinawith the means to continue the fight against Japan and to help to decrease the sense of isolation which Plis Majesty&apos;s Government are advised is having an increasingly adverse effect on Chinese morale. In these circumstances, HisMajesty&apos;s Government feel confident that in the interests of the joint war effortthe Soviet Government will consider sympathetically the Chinese&apos; requests andwill give every facility and assistance so far as lies within their power in developing the routes in question.
ANNEX III.THE treatment of His Majesty&apos;s Consulate-General at Kashgar and ofBritish subjects in Sinkiang in recent years has left much to be desired. Numerousrepresentations have been made both to the Chinese Central Government and tothe provincial authorities. In August last year the matter was also raised bySir S. Cripps with the Soviet Government, who informed him on the 6th Octoberthat they had communicated with the provincial Government and received a replyto the effect that the latter would, at the appropriate moment, take the necessary measures for the establishment of personal contact between His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General and the Tupan.Indian British subjects, however, continue to be subjected to ill-treatment andboycott, and large numbers of them have been deported to India in circumstancesof great hardship after confiscation of their property. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-GeneraTs protests on this subject have been disregarded, and he has not been allowed to visit Indian British subjects in outlying districts, particularly atYarkand. Trade between Sinkiang and India has been virtually stopped.Finally, efforts made by His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General during the last twelvemonths to arrange a visit to Urumchi, in order to discuss matters personally withthe high provincial authorities, have so far been evaded on the plea of sickness.His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware that the Sinkiang Provincial Govern-ment attach great weight to the views of the Soviet Government. They.venture,therefore, to express the hope that the Soviet Government will see their way totake the matter up again with the Provincial Government, with a view to theimprovement of conditions affecting British subjects in Sinkiang and in particular to the grant of facilities to His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General to travel freely inSinkiang and to visit the provincial capital for the discussion of outstanding questions.Foreign Office, June 9, 1942.ANNEX IV.AS the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are aware,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have expressed their desire toestablish British consular posts in the Soviet Union.Having regard to the alliance established between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and to the factthat it would be of considerable convenience in making Soviet-British co-operation as effective as possible in the common war effort, His Majesty&apos;s Government would appreciate it if the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics wouldreconsider their point of view in this matter and agree in principle to theestablishment of certain British consular posts in the Soviet Union. For their part, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared, as a measure of reciprocity, toagree to the establishment of Soviet consular posts in the United Kingdom.Foreign Office, June 9, 1942.
