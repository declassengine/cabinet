Q E6 3DOCUMENT IS THE PR0P3HTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT).S E C R E T,W.P.(48) 187o COPY H0.^1STK MAY, 1942,,VA : CABII ;ST.PUBLICATION OF DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATING THE COURSEOF AlpLO-^RMAN RELATIONS&quot; BETV7SEN LOCARNO and memorandum byvthe Lord Qhancellor01, The War Cabinet;, when it had before it theForeign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum on this subject (W,P,(G)(41) 139), asked me -o examine the collection of diplomaticdocuments on Anglo--German relations from 1925 to 1939,which MrQ E,-Lo Woodward was engaged in making on behalfof the Foreign Office; and to make a report in order tohelp the War Cabinet to decide whether the suggestedpublication should now be made...      The material-is.nowin proof form;    it will be contained in three largevolumes; and it comprises no less than 1*200 pages ofquarto size-,      It&apos; has thus taken a long time to readand digest; and I regret that it has not been possibleto make my report more promptly...2a I started my reading with an inclination infavour of the plan of publication now- and I understandthat this was the view taken in the Foreign Office-though the Foreign Secretary told us he had had no time personally to go through the contents himself0Further consideration makes me doubt the wisdom of thiscoarse; and I set out briefly the pros and cons in thehope that this may help the War Cabinet to come toa decision.-30 If these bulky volumes are read throughsystematically and impartially, there can be no doubt at all that they demonstrate how sincerely successiveBritish Governments have striven for an understanding with Germanyr and thereby for the maintenance ofpeace-      If there is any honest and intelligent man who today believes that Britain provoked the war against Germany., he could not retain such a beliefafter exammg this collection.-,      The story thus setout also shows very conclusively how Germany remainedstolidly unresponsive to our efforts and; whenreproached with creating nothing but fresh difficulties,replied by complaining of bad treatment and by makingnew professions which were i!rusory0      In fact; Ithink the main criticism of British pre-war policy as a

mv/hole which may **aij?.ly &quot;be- deduced from these documentsis that we trusted too much to German assurances,,Diplomatic documents can at host only recount part ofthe history, for they do not fully reveal thetendencies of British opinion or the operation ofParliamentary forces,      Our unilateral disarmaraent,the peace ballot-, the -efforts for collective securitythrough the .r,eag       fall vui-te outside the surveyBThere is,, X think, only one parliament.imcn.tary speechincluded in the collection, and only on^ speech atGenevao      The circumstances in which Germany left the Disarmament Conference were fully explained tothe House of Commons on November 7th,- 1933 - theycannot, be gathered from this collection of diplomaticpaperSo4o One consideration which lias been urged in favourof prompt publication is that these documents providematerial to counter Gorman propaganda about the new order, and that it is dosirable to forestall propagandafrom Germany after the war,, which will he exertedto put the blame for the war upon us0     These are.,of course;, important matters, bub I venture to thinkthat there is nevertheless an argument againstprompt publication v/hich should be fully weighed,,50 Whatever may have boon the case after 1918,is there any sane man here or abroad v/ho really needson the present occasion proof that it was hitler and not ourselves who brought about this war, or thatwe did all we could to avoid it0      If German brutalitvIn Poland, Holland, &quot;fugo-Slavia &quot;and occupiedFrance does not convince our contemporaries wherethe crime lies, are 1,200 -pages of print going to doso?      It seems to me that while these three volumeswill have great value for the historian, they are not really an essential part of our counter-propaganda inpresent circumstanceSo6e Moreover) what sort of man is going to make use of these bulky volumes during the intensity ofwaging war?    &apos;There are no neutrals to speak of-so the immediate influence to be exerted will be inbelligerent countries.,  or at any rate in countriesv/hich have already taken up a strong bias in favourof one side or the other.      No doubt there will be avery limited number of individuals who will have timeand inclination to study this material as it needs to be studied^      One could almost give a list of thepublicists and political writers who will contributeweighty articles on the subject to the serious reviews,But is it not to be expected that the principal usemade of this quarry will he to extract a chunk to beused in a less impartial  and more sensational kind of controversy?     And is this really going to contribute to full concentration on the wax- effort, and to maximumunity?     A hasty and tendentious handling of this material might lead to some unsettlement of opinion,which here and in the occupied countries - and in theUnited States also  - is now so solidly against Germanclaims and excuses0

70 I do not wish to press these considerations too strongly? for I realise that there are solid arguments for the other view, hut as it is improbable that members of the War Cabinet will at present find timethemselves to study this collection of fifteen yearsof Anglo-German diplomacy, I have done my best topresent the reflections I have formed from a carefulperusalos.House of Lords,7th May,  1942c
