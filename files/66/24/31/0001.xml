Jr.13th&apos;Hay, 1942.DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS IN WESf africa memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Vest-Africa already has a very important part to play in our war effort, and its importance is ever increasing.Although it is not at present an area of operations it might become one at any moment.2.        I have been considering the desirability of new methods of ensuring co-ordinated control over the whole field of defence services, both military and civil,  in West Africa.Apart from our own internal interests of great importance,there are other elements to be taken very much into account,e.g.  relations with the Free French and Belgians in neighbouring territories,  and the problems arising out of theever growing American interest in this area.3.        The Chairman of the West African Governors&apos;Conference already has cart,.in powers to give directionsfor the-purpose of assisting co-ordination between the british civil and military authorities, but these are limited in scope and can be made fully effective only in circumstances of clearemergency.    It is felt that  some special authority is needed in the present situation to ensure and maintain continuouslocal control and unity of direction.4.        In Ceylon this has been achieved by the specialappointment of Admiral Lay ton as CommancIer-in-Ghief,  with powers of direction in all fields of Government and defence -civil- and military.5.        I recommend,  with the concurrence of the Chiefs ofStaff,  that a special appointment or: similiar lines   be created for -Vest Africa.    The proposed authority and responsibilityof the Commander-in-Chief in West Arnica are- set out in thedraft directive annexed,  with which also the Chiefs of staff are in agreement,6.        In the present situation I feel that the holder ofthe post should be a high officer of one of the fighting-services, but one who would not himself be saddled with the    .operational command of any of the services.    If there is any objection to the use of the title &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot;,  and someother has to be found,  it would&apos; be important to avoid any suchtitle as &quot;Governor General&quot; or &quot;High Commissioner&quot; which doesnot mark the special war-time character of the arrangement andwould therefore be open to objection in that it might bo taken as a precedent for post-war administration in West Africa andso revive undesirable political controversy.Colonial Office,loth May,  1942.
