THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  Aprilil942.POST-PROTOCOL SUPPLIES TO RUSSIA.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.THE Minister of Production in his Paper W.P. (42) 178 makes twocriticisms of my proposals for the supply of aircraft to Russia under the termsof the Moscow Protocol.1. Types.(a) In his opinion it is a mistake to send to Russia &quot; planes such as theTyphoon which have not yet been proved.&quot; Yet we sent the Russiansthe Airacobra when we had less experience of it than we have had of the Typhoon.The Typhoon is a good fighter aircraft, and is capable of catchingany other aircraft in the world. No aircraft of its size and powercan be as manoeuvrable as a Spitfire or a Hurricane, and it will haveto adopt different fighting tactics. Nevertheless, it is the fastest andprobably one of the most formidable fighter aircraft in any Air force to-day.There is no need to force the Typhoon on the Russians; they will want it.(&amp;) The Minister suggests that we should offer the Russians American dive-bombers or Wellingtons. American dive-bombers are not available inMay and June and are absolutely unproven. Far from havingWellingtons to spare, the fact.is that the shortage of propellers forWellingtons and Whitleys is threatening to cripple our bomberoffensive.Our deficiencies in Wellingtons are as follows :  A ir craft.Wellington III Squadrons        ...       ...       ...        35Bomber and Coastal O.T.Us.    ...       ...      ...       105To-day there are in the Aircraft Storage Units 157 WellingtonIlls, of which 115 are without propellers. On the basis of M.A.P.forecasts there will be 325 Wellingtons in store without propellersat the end of July.Our deficiencies in Whitleys are as follows :- A aircraft.Coastal Command Squadrons    ...       ...      ...        12Bomber and Coastal O.T.Us.    ...      ...       ...       108Glider Squadrons ...       ...      ...      ...        16[23760]MOST SECRET. Copy No.     2W.P. (42) 181.April 29, 1942.TO JBE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.
To-day there are in the Aircraft Storage Units 176 Whitleys, ofwhich 109 are without propellers.This shortage of propellers must slow down the Bomber offensive and delay the training of aircrews.    The Ministry of aircraft production are fully alive to the seriousness of the propeller situation&apos;i -,,       and are grappling with it.  Meanwhile, it is idle to consider sendingbombers to Russia.2. Numbers in May and June. If, apart from the Airacobras andTyphoons, we are to make up the balance in May and June with Hurricanes, thereare only two sources, apart from small and indispensable allotments to opera-tional training, and to the Admiralty, from which they could be obtained :  (a) The Metropolitan Air Force.(&amp;) Middle East and India.(a) There are only 12 squadrons in this country 9 are the essentialsatellites to the Turbinlite Flights and must be maintained atall costs. Two are fighter-bombers and one is long-range. Wecannot do with less.(b) In view of impending operations in the Middle East and of the weakness of our air defence in India and Ceylon, it is certainthat we ought to accelerate rather than curtail our allocation tothese countries.Accordingly, I have for some time advocated on the Allied Supplies Com-mittee that we should bring into operation the last paragraph of the Moscowprotocol. The war situation has changed since the protocol was signed. TheJapanese have not merely entered the war; they have advanced to the gates ofIndia, and are threatening Ceylon. We are already engaged in an air offensivewhich is containing two-thirds of the German fighter force. Further operations are in prospect which require a greater reserve of fighter aircraft than we yetpossess. The congestion of shipping in the ports of Iceland makes it unlikelythat all the Russian supplies can be shipped in May and June. In this situationwe ought, according to the protocol, to consult the Russians and ask them to consent to some diminution in our supplies of fighter aircraft for the months ofMay and June in order that we may play our own part in the air war againstGermany and Japan.The alternative is a decision by the Defence Committee in favour of main-taining the protocol export of lighter aircraft to. Russia at all costs, and an instruction to the Chiefs of Staff to indicate the source from which these aircraft are to be obtained.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, April 29, 1942.
