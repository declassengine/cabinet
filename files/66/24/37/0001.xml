R. A.Dominions Office,May 15, 1942.(Confidential.)My Lord, December 10, 1941.IN the past few weeks there has been a notable awakening of interest in theconditions of life of the native populations of the towns of the Union. this may be traced to a variety of causes, not least of which is the poor response toappeals for native recruits for labour service in the Army and the Governmentsrealisation that natives can hardly be expected to show much enthusiasm for a&quot; democratic &quot; cause which has yielded them so little in the way of materialbenefit. The Prime Minister two months ago appointed a Committee to inquire into the conditions of urban natives. Under the able and sympathetic chairman-ship of Mr. D. L. Smit, the Secretary for Native Affairs, it has brought to light a condition of affairs in the principal towns of the Union that is provingprofoundly shocking to a European conscience made vulnerable by the social ideas of a wartime world. The effects on public opinion of this inquiry have been reinforced by the evidence given before another Committee set up to considerthe question of municipal beer-houses for natives. The Press, including all butthe most violently Nationalist newspapers (which are absorbed in political warfare), has been admirable both in the prominence given to reports of theseinquiries and in the vigour and enlightenment of its comments. Finally, theleaders of liberal opinion are now tending to concentrate more upon exposingconcrete defects of native administration than upon the exposition of general principles which alarm a European public only too easily disturbed by doctrinessubversive of established social relationships.[23824] b
22. At the census of 1936 the native population was 6,596,000, distributed among the Provinces as follows : Transvaal     ..................      2,444,000Cape ...Natal ..O.F.S....2,045,0001,554,000553,000With the exception of the urbanized native population on the Witwatersrapd. thegreatest density of Bantu settlement was in the Transkeian territories in theeastern districts of the Cape. This area contained a population of 1,154,000 or70 per square mile. 2,972,000 natives were living in the &quot;native areas&quot; and3,614,000 on European-owned lands; i.e., some 45 per cent, were living undertribal or semi-tribal conditions and 55 per cent, in towns or as labourers orsquatters on European farms. This group of labourers and squatters amountedto no less than 2,190,000, forming a vast landless proletariat comprising morethan one-third of the whole native population of the Union.3. The urbanized group of natives numbered 1,400,000, divided asfollows : (1) Residential Urban areas and Town lands     ... 390,000(2) Mining Compounds       ............ 387,000(3) Urban Locations ............      ... 355,000(4) Industrial Compounds   ...      ...      ...      ... 114,000(5) Municipal Compounds   ...      ...      ...      ... 36,000(6) Construction gangs (Road and Railway)     ... 43,000(7) Rural European Townships and Town suburbs 47,000(8) Alluvial diggings         ............ 25,000It is clear, however, that the native workers in mine compounds are not town-dwelling in the normal sense since they are regimented and confined to narrowly-restricted areas on mining property. They are, in fact, &quot; tribal &quot; natives drawn on temporary contracts from &quot; native areas &quot; all over Southern Africa, includingterritories outside the Union. Moreover, of the large group of native domestic servants in category (1) of the above table, probably many more than half areonly temporarily urbanized and retain their connexions with families in the&quot; native areas.&quot; Allowing for these deductions, and in the absence of accuratefigures, the permanently town-dwelling native population may be estimated at about 600,000. It is this group of urbanized natives and the conditions underwhich they live which has given rise to what is the most acute sociologicalproblem in South Africa to-day. For it is in the towns that the pretences of territorial &quot; segregation &quot; and the clumsy rationalisations about the natives being encouraged to &quot; develop on their own lines &quot; are most apparent. It is in the towns, where Europeans and natives are brought into closest contact, that the doctrine of trusteeship is put to its most relentless test.4. It was not until about 1912 that any considerable movement, from thecountry to the towns became apparent. In the years that followed the growth ofindustry, with its dependence on a supply of cheap native labour, led to a steadyconcentration of natives in the towns. Although the Act of Union specificallydefined native affairs as the province of the Central Government, there remainedmuch ambiguity about the precise powers of the town and city councils in regardto the native populations gathered within their borders. The administrationof native affairs in the towns was not placed upon a properly formal basis untilthe Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923. In the interval town councils usedwhat authority they had to push their native populations into &apos;&apos; locations &apos;&apos; onthe outskirts of the town lands, as far as possible from the European residentialareas and usually separated from them by a belt of veld which might be anythingup to 7 miles in width. There was practically no attempt at decentadministration. Roads and lighting were not provided and water might beprovided at one or two communal taps in only the more advanced municipalities.5. In Port Elizabeth, one of the four or five towns which had any considerable native population at the beginning of the century, this tendencywas carried even further. In 1902 plague broke out in the native location anda terrified city council promptly bundled its occupants out of the town. the natives carried as much as they could of their dwellings on their heads and
deposited these bits of corrugated iron on the veld at Korsten, beyond the city&apos;sboundary, where in time there grew up a large township of hovels housing22,000 Cape coloured people, natives and even a sprinkling of poor whites. Butthe mere extrusion of the native population could solve rio problems. Diseasemocks at municipal boundaries. The citizens of Port Elizabeth refused as longas they could to accept the fact that, since the majority of the people of Korstenhad work in the city, the township could not merely be disowned and left tomoulder on the borders. By 1931, however, it had become generally recognisedthat Korsten was a grave menace to the health of the city, and the municipalarea was extended to include it. This process of slum formation has been repeated on the outskirts of numerous other towns, where European farms havebeen proclaimed townships and divided into plots, which have been sold tonatives for building purposes. A typical example of such townships isGarsfontein, 2 miles outside the Pretoria boundary, where sub-divisions of theoriginal plots are now sold for as much as  70, some thousands of natives are dependent for water upon an insanitary stream and no social services of any kind are provided.6. In 1914 the report of a commission to inquire into the incidence oftuberculosis first directed public attention to the unsatisfactory conditions prevailing in urban areas; The commission declared that it knew of no municipallocation which was entirely satisfactory. Among the defects of the locations wereill-chosen sites, the absence of any systematic lay-out, the inadequacy or completeabsence of sanitary services, the lack of any proper water supply and theuncontrolled keeping of animals. &apos;&apos; But,&apos;&apos; said the Commission, &quot;it is withthe character of the dwellings that the greatest fault must be found. With few exceptions they are a disgrace, and the majority are quite unfit for human habitation. ... Speaking generally, the dwellings are mere shanties, oftennothing more than hovels, constructed out of bits of old packing-case lining,flattened kerosene tins, sacking and other scraps and odds and ends. . . . Thedwellings are low, dark and dirty, generally encumbered with unclean and uselessrubbish. Mud floors are the rule, often below the ground level and consequentlyapt to be flooded in wet weather. Overcrowding is frequent; and altogether one could hardly imagine more suitable conditions for the spread of tuberculosis.&quot;The Commission added, that many local authorities were making out of theirlocations a profit which was placed to general revenue. Before anything couldbe done to carry into effect the recommendations of the Commission the warintervened. Then the influenza epidemic of October 1918 provided a powerfulstimulus to action. Natives died in thousands, and the menace of the locationsto the health of the whole population was grimly demonstrated. Anotherfive years elapsed before the Native (Urban Areas) Act was passed.7. This Act, with the amending Act of 1937, defines the powers and obligations of the local authorities in relation to the native populations in their areas. The municipalities were empowered to provide accommodation for nativesin the form of locations, villages and hostels. These tj^pes were devised to providefor the principal classes of natives. Locations were to accommodate the normalfloating and less stable section of the population, which could not afford morethan the bare necessities of life. In general, the buildings w*ould be the propertyof the municipality and would be let on a monthly tenure to natives living underfamily conditions, whose employment and residence in the area was temporary andprecarious. The native village, on the other hand, was conceived as an area for themore stable and prosperous section, whose employment was fixed and whoseresidence might be expected to be more or less permanent. In the first draft ofthe Bill introduced into Parliament provision was made not only for the lease of, but also the ownership of, lots by natives. The House of Assembly, however,deleted the words relating to ownership, and in the 1937 amending Act ownershipby natives was expressly prohibited. Hostels were for the accommodation ofnatives not living under the conditions of family life. Parliament envisaged the provisions of barracks of single rooms or dormitories where native workers,whose stay in the town alternated with periods of return to the country, couldlive, and where communal arrangements could be made for feeding, washing and social life.8.   The amended Urban Areas Act makes provision for the residentialsegregation of natives in the towns.    A native is not allowed to acquire any[23824] b 2
interest in land in &quot; white &quot; areas, and with the increasing flow of natives to the towns all urban native administration has come to be based on the principle thatin the towns European interests are paramount and in them the native maylive only on sufferance. Thus, amendments to the Act have introduced manystringent provisions designed to control and restrict the entry of natives into an urban area. These provisions were inspired partly by dissatisfaction overnative crime, especially on the Witwatersrand, but more effectively by complaints of farmers that their labourers were being enticed away by the higher wages andthe &quot; glamour &quot; of the towns.9. In order to end the abuses by which certain municipalities were makinga profit out of the locations, the Act&apos;made it obligatory on every local authority with natives in its borders to maintain a Native Revenue Account, into whichwas to be paid all revenue derived from native administration. Against the account were chargeable only services rendered directly to natives or expenditure incurred on the locations or hostels.10. The respective responsibilities of the local and central authorities weredefined. According to a high official of the Native Affairs Department, &apos;&apos; the Actplaced upon the municipalities the responsibility for the good order, health and well-being of those living and working within the area of its jurisdiction. It wasnecessary that they should have powers to carry out their obligations to bothsections of the community as efficiently as possible. On the other hand, the natives have no representation on the municipal or city councils, and it is accordingly the duty of the Government to see that their interests are protectedand that the administration within the urban areas conforms to the general policywhich has been laid down for the conduct of native affairs throughout the Union.&quot;The Department of Native Affairs has, accordingly, been invested with veryconsiderable powers of supervision. The Minister&apos;s approval is necessary for the lay-out of locations, and he has to be satisfied about the adequacy of the water,lighting, sanitary and other services. He may draw the attention of localauthorities to defects in their areas, and if they are not remedied he may himselfassume control, effect the necessary improvements and recover the costs from themunicipality concerned. He has the power to enforce, over the municipality^head, the provisions relating to the control of entry into its area; municipalofficials in charge of native administration have to be licensed by him. He haswide powers of inspection. The Native Revenue Accounts have to be submittedto him for his approval. With what degree of effectiveness the Native AffairsDepartment carries out these supervisory functions it is difficult to say. TheDepartment claims that through &quot; tactful &quot; representations many municipalitieshave been made to see the error of their ways, arid it is certain that inspectors ofthe Department have clone useful work in exposing some of the more obviousabuses in the locations. But it is difficult to resist the conclusion that moreenergetic and less &quot; tactful &quot; handling of some municipalities would have greatlyspeeded up the process of improvement. This point is referred to again in a laterparagraph describing the conditions in the municipal location in Capetown.The only notable occasion on which the Department has exercised its powers overthe head of one of the larger municipalities was its enforcement of a restriction on the entry of natives into the Cape Peninsula; and then it acted not so muchin the supposed interests of this area, but under pressure from farming organisa-tions who complained of a lack of native labour.11. Of the duties laid upon the municipalities by the Urban Areas Act theprovision of proper housing is by far the most important. Unfortunately, it isonly within the last seven or eight years that they have made any effective efforts to rehouse the natives living under appalling conditions in &apos;1 black spots &apos;&apos; in the cities and in the municipal locations. The problem is, of course, largely financialfor only a negligible proportion of natives is able to afford an economic rent for houses, andmunicipalities have been unwilling to bear the expense of sub-economichousing schemes. The turning-point came in 1934 when the Central HousingBoard decided to extend to native housing schemes the help which had up to then been given only to schemes for the benefit of the poorer sections of the european population. Out of a total fund of nearly  15 million, which the Governmenthad promised to make available in instalments for sub-economic housing,municipalities would be able to borrow money at f per cent, per annum, on theunderstanding that in estimating the rents to be charged they should bear a loss
equal to half that borne by the Government in providing the loan. The result was that, whereas in the 15 years from 1920-35 the municipalities had spent atotal of  1,260,000, in the five succeeding years they had planned to spend 5,200,000 on native housing. This by no means exhausts the funds which theGovernment has promised to make available for sub-economic housing, but it isclear that further progress depends on the rate at which the Government is ableto provide the necessary funds and the extent to which war exigencies interferewith the supply of building materials and of labour. Numerous housing schemes are, in fact, held up for these reasons.12. The progress in the rehousing of the urban native population variesgreatly from town to town. In five years Port Elizabeth, with the aid of Gover-n-ment sub-economic loans, has rehoused the 22,000 native and coloured inhabitants of Korsten in the well-planned township of New Brighton and at rents ranging from 145. to 16s. a month (for native houses of two and three rooms). The city isat the moment fortunate in its possession of an energetic and liberal-mindedCouncil and its achievement isuniquein South Africa. Colonel Reitz,the Ministerof Native Affairs, said after an inspection of the housing schemes: &quot;PortElizabeth has worked a miracle . . . . It has solved the native question within its boundaries. This is where the Government must learn a lesson.&quot; The threelarger cities, however, have an unenviable record. In Capetown about one-thirdof the native population has been housed in the only location, at Langa. TheNative Affairs Commission, during a recent visit to the city, described theconditions at Langa as &apos;1 disgraceful and appalling &apos;&apos; and declared that they were&apos;&apos; filled with indignation that such conditions had been allowed to continue in the mother City.&quot; The remaining two-thirds of the native population live indiscreditable slums near the centre of the city or in filthy tin shacks congregatedin hundreds on the Cape Flats.13. In Durban the problem is of a different kind, for there 85 per cent, of native workers have their homes and families in the reserves near the city. these workers live in barracks in the city, and the absence of family life has resultedin a low standard of sex morality and a terribly high incidence of venerealdisease. The City Council has simply neglected its duty of establishing nativevillages, as contemplated in the Urban Areas Act, in which native workers in thecity could lead a wholesome family life.14. In Johannesburg about one-quarter of the Urban native population ishoused at Orlando, a &quot;location&quot; of 60,000 inhabitants. The houses are of areasonable standard, but all but the newest have to depend for their water supply on taps set at intervals of six houses in the street. The roads are dusty andunmade and the general absence of trees gives the township an appearance ofdesolation and neglect. There are two doctors in the township. They areavailable from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and are heavily overworked. At night it is virtually impossible to obtain- a doctor from Johannesburg, which is 10 miles away. Rents here vary from  1 to  1 5s. a month, and a big hole is made innative incomes by a railway charge of 15s. a month between Orlando andJohannesburg. At two other locations, Pimville and the Western Township,slums grew up before they were taken over by the municipality, and the city council is now in the position of a slum landlord drawing rent from hundreds ofpitiable hovels. As a result of a recent exposure of conditions in these twolocations, the rents were reduced by 50 per cent. Just beyond the Johannesburg-boundary on the main road to Pretoria is Alexandra, where thousands of nativeshave built their own houses in a township which has no municipal services or control. The city, however, is fast expanding in this direction, and there is now a strong movement to clear Alexandra out of the way. The City Council hascarried through the first stages of a plan to buy land 20 miles from the Citywhich it will divide into lots to be sold to natives for building purposes. here the population of Alexandra will in time be rehoused, with full municipalresponsibility for the supply of the necessary services. The success or otherwise of the scheme will depend very largely upon the cost of transport between thenative &quot; village &quot; and Johannesburg. In Johannesburg at the present time,and indeed in the great majority of municipalities, native transport is left to private enterprise. Transport services for the European section! on the otherhand, are generally provided by the local authorities, and are subsidised out of[23824] b 3
general revenue. So that one finds the anomaly in Pretoria, for example, thatnatives are charged 9d. by a private bus service for a journey for which Europeansare charged od. by the municipal service.15. It is significant of the attitude of most municipalities to the nativepopulations within their boundaries that they almost invariably regard theirNative Revenue Accounts as self-balancing, or, in other words, that the urbannatives within their areas should pay in full for every service supplied to them.The urban natives are, indeed, treated as a race apart, without any claim on thegeneral wealth of the community which their labour does so much to create :they are not regarded simply as the poorest section of the citizens and as suchentitled to social services for which they as a group cannot pay. Somemunicipalities, indeed, contrive to keep charges high enough and expenditure onnative services low enough to yield a large surplus which is left to the credit of the Native Revenue Account or spent on the purchase of capital equipment.Thus, in Durban, out of the Native Revenue Accounfs total income of  107,300in 1938, no less than  37,600 was net profit. In Johannesburg in 1938 therewas a deficit of  23,100 on the Native Revenue Account, which was carried forward in anticipation of a surplus at some later date : it was not met out ofgeneral revenue. Since then the establishment of a municipal monopoly for thebrewing and sale of kaffir beer has given the municipality something like  75.000a year with which to cover deficits in the account and undertake services whichit would not undertake at the cost of general revenue. Here and in many othermunicipalities which have availed themselves of the right to establish a kaffirbeer monopoly the profits on municipal beer halls are used to relieve the Europeanratepayer from the necessity of making a contribution to the Native revenue account. &quot;All schemes.&quot; it has been said, &quot;are floated on beer,&quot; includinggrants to charities and voluntary social welfare agencies.16. The better municipalities (Pretoria is a creditable example in thisrespect) have in recent years provided their native populations with clinics, butin the great majority health services are terribly inadequate. Malnutrition, badhousing and inadequate health services combine to raise the native death ratein the towns to almost incredible levels. In East London, where the condition ofthe natives is deplorable, last year the death rate of native babies was 544 per thousand, and in many other big towns it is not much less. In Durban the incidence of tuberculosis has increased to such an extent as a result of badhousing, .the diminishing proportion of milk in the natives&apos; diet, and other factors, that public opinion is at last beginning to show signs of alarm. the hospitals are the responsibility of the Provincial authorities (subsidised by theCentral Government), and there is hardly a town which does not complain aboutthe inadequacy of hospital accommodation for natives. The truth is that inrecent years the spread of education and health propaganda have done much tobreak down the traditional fear of hospitals among the natives. InJohannesburg magistrates conducting coroners&apos; inquests have drawn attention tothe disgraceful overcrowding at the Johannesburg.non-European Hospital, whichin many cases makes proper attention impossible. It has led directly to deathswhich might otherwise have been avoided. Their remarks have been fullyreported by the newspapers and used as a basis of a Press agitation which has done much to arouse public opinion. The authorities have been shaken, andthere is now talk of building a temporary addition. But the best hope of animprovement in hospital accommodation for Johannesburg natives lies in a recentannouncement that the Defence Department is to build a hospital of 1.000 bedsadjoining the boundary of Orlando, which will be available after the war fornative patients and the training of native doctors. In Pretoria hospital accommodation for natives is described as &quot; adequate,&quot; but there are few townswhich can make claims even as modestly vague as this about the medicalprovision for their native populations.17. In the larger towns the average wage of the head of a native householdof man, wife and two children is about  4 5s. per month. Calculations of theminimum income needed for healthy living vary considerably, according to thestandard desired. The Medical Officer of Health of Benoni has estimated that 6 18s. Sd. per month is needed for food alone; the Director of Native labour on the Witwatersrand estimated that a minimum income of  6 per month isessential to the well-being of a native family of four living in a location in
Johannesburg. No investigator has suggested that  6 is anything but the lowest possible figure, and this without taking into account the rise in the costof foodstuffs brought about by war conditions. There is thus a gap of almost  2between the earnings of the average native urban worker and the minimumneeded to maintain a family in health. The gap is bridged either by the wifeooino&quot; out to work or by the proceeds from the illicit brewing of skokiaan, anoxious drink of kaffir beer laced with carbide and other explosive ingredients.If neither of these alternatives is possible, the family is condemned to severeprivation.18. Official policy, faced with this problem of native poverty, tends to seek a solution in the improvement and extension of social services. It is significant that the Commission appointed to enquire into the conditions of native urbanlife was expressly told that it should limit its recommendations to improvements which do not include a rise in wages. It is undoubtedly true that a great increaseof native welfare would result from a speeding up of housing schemes, and thata reduction in rents and transport charges would leave a larger proportion of family incomes to be spent on food. The example of the two or threemunicipalities which sell milk at cost price or even at a small loss could be more generally followed; and arrangements might be made for the co-operativepurchase of vegetables and other &quot; protective &quot; foods. Creches for children ofmothers who go out to work are a help, and the system could with advantage beextended. More schools could, and should, be provided in the locations, and education made compulsory up to the elementary school-leaving standard. It isclear from previous paragraphs that there is room for great improvement in health services. But at the root of the whole native social problem is the low level of wages. The improvement of social services would bring instant relief tothousands of hard-pressed native families, but without an increase in wages these measures would have the effect of pauperising a whole people.19. The problem of the native wage level is now receiving much attention from economists and others. It is the fashion to emphasise the necessity of raising the purchasing power of the native population as the only practicablesolution to the problem of providing South African manufacturing industry with a stable market. Cabinet Ministers admit that the Government, as thelargest employer&apos;of native labour in the country, has set a deplorably low standardin the matter of wages; and Mr. Sturrock. the Minister of Railways, has openlydeclared that after the war the wages of natives on the railways will have to beraised. The municipalities, too, are large employers of natives; Johannesburgalone has 12.000 in its service. The majority pay wages below the urban average.The Durban Corporation, however, a month ago raised the minimum wage of itsnative employees from  5 to  7 a month, and by this action set the municipalitiesa new standard in the treatment of their native employees. It is significant thatthe proposal was carried only in the face of intense opposition from the leadersof industry, who complained about the repercussions of such action on the levelof wages paid by secondary industry.20. The overriding legal disability of the urban native is, of course, the -so-called Colour Bar Act of 1926, which prohibits the admission of the native toapprenticeship in the skilled trades. This measure was exacted by the LabourParty as the price of its participation in the notorious &quot; Pact Government &quot; of1924-29; and there is, unfortunately, no sign that the Labour Party has made any progress in the intervening period towards a more enlightened attitude. Itis no less determined now than it has ever been to maintain a system of race discrimination which bolsters up the wage level of the European worker atthe expense of the native. It still wrings out of employers concessions which appear generous but are in reality made at the expense of native workers, who cannot protect their interests by effective organisation. It still classifies workers as &quot;skilled&quot; and &quot;unskilled&quot; when what it really means is &quot;white&quot; and&quot;non-white.&quot; It dramatises its role in the &quot;fight for socialism,&quot; but betraysnot the slightest sign of practical sympathy for its non-European fellow-workers,ft is, in fact, one of the most reactionary forces in South Africa so far as theposition of the native worker is concerned.21. Even as an unskilled worker the native is not admitted to the right of collective bargaining and arbitration embodied in the Industrial Conciliation
Act. His trades unions are not recognised by the law. He does, however, come within the scope of the Wage Board, which is doing useful work in levering wages to a slightly higher level in some fields of employment. At the end of 1939 the wage Board promulgated minimum wages for employees in the commercial anddistributive trades in the chief industrial centres of the Union. These rangedfrom  6 in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg to  4 15s. in Durbanand  4 6s. 8d. in Pietermaritzburg. These wages are low enough, but they area notable improvement on the levels which prevailed before the award; in PortElizabeth the wage of native workers in the commercial and distributive tradesranged from  3 7s. to  4 10s., and in Johannesburg from  3 10s. to  4 5s. Theaward, however, applies to only a small proportion of the native working popula-tion and the standard it set has not been maintained by the recent wagedetermination for secondary industry, in which 150,000 natives are employed.Industrialists declare that they cannot pay more, and, in support of this contention, point to the prevailing high level of costs of production, which make sit almost impossible, under the conditions of peace time, to compete in export markets. The truth is that, because native labour is cheap and unorganised, itis wastefully used, and there is no effective pressure on employers to increase its efficiency.22. It is possible that in time secondary industry, as a result of rationalisation -sation and the more efficient use of labour, might be persuaded to raise by degreesthe wages of its native workers. But any general policy of raising the wage level would encounter a most formidable obstacle in the enormous power of the gold-mines and the farmers. In the Platteland areas wages of farm labourers(excluding food and shelter) are nearer 12s. Qd. than  1 a month. Farmerscomplain of a continuous shortage of labour; but it is significant that they relyfor an improvement in the labour supply, not on a rise in wages and more attractive living conditions, but on such legal hindrances to the mobility oflabour as the Pass Laws and the restrictions on the entry of natives into the towns. The existence of 2 million underpaid landless African squatters on european farms is one of the major obstacles to improved farming methods, suchas mechanisation, and the farmer class is probably the most reactionary of allin its attitude to natives and their essential needs.23. For forty years the average wage on the Witwatersrand ^gold-mines has remained stationary at  3 per month (excluding the value of barrack lodgingand rations). During that period there has developed a shortage of native labour which might have been expected to cause a rise in wages. Such is the political influence of the mine-owners, however, that the whole bargaining power of theState has been brought into action to avert impending shortages by persuading the Administration of Portuguese East Africa to agree to the recruitment ofShangaans for the mines on an ever-increasing scale. When that source had beenfully tapped the ban was raised on the importation of native labourers from north of latitude 22 degrees North. Here the discoveries of medical science havehelped the mines to circumvent the operation of economic law; the drug popularly- known as &quot; M and B &apos;&apos; has reduced almost to vanishing point the incidence ofpneumonia among sub-tropical natives exposed to the temperature changes of the transvaal high veld. Absolved by large-scale importation from the. threat oflabour shortage, the Chamber of Mines exerts an enormous pressure behind thescenes and through its newspapers to resist any rise in the general level of nativewages. It is this influence that the Bishop of Johannesburg had in mind whenhe referred in his charge to a recent Synod to the restraining action of &quot; ahidden hand.&quot;24. In the low level of native wages is discernible the operation of a principle which lies at the very base of the South African economy. SenatorHeaton Nicholls, the chief exponent of the segregationist myth, recently declaredthat it was the aim of official policy &quot; to set aside sufficient land in the reserves to provide a family anchorage for all natives except the comparatively smallsections which must be considered as permanently detribalised and urbanised.&quot;In other words, the wages paid to natives employed on the mines and on european-owned farms are not to be regarded as family wages, but merely thewages of the individual worker. The worker&apos;s family must get along as best itcan on the produce of the land, supplemented by contributions from the wage-
earner for the discharge of such obligations as taxes which have to be met in cash. It is notorious, however, that the native reserves to quote the words ofa recent Government report &quot;are congested, overstocked, eroded and, for themost part, in a deplorable condition.&quot; The pace of land purchase, which beganso promisingly m 1937, fell to a limp in the following year and is now entirelyand regrettably halted during the war, with less than&quot;  5,000,000 spent out ofthe  10,000,000 which General Hertzog had promised in the debates on the natives Land Act of 1936. The reserves, in fact, far from providing the nativepeople with a position of relative independence which would enable them to standout for higher wages, serve merely to subsidise the wages paid on the mines andthe farms and exert a depressing influence on the wage level of the permanentlyurbanised section.25. In the last resort there are two conditions on the fulfilment of whichwill depend the economic improvement of the native population.
