THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1942.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (42) 206.May 14, 1942./WAR CABINET.SERVICE DEPARTMENTS AND PUBLICITY.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.THE Press of the United Nations and of friendly neutral countries have consistently under-estimated Britain&apos;s military effort, and Axis propagandistshave taken full advantage of this fact. One of the main reasons for thisdeplorable&apos; situation is undoubtedly the failure of the Service Departments to appreciate the importance of the right kind of publicity for military and naval operations and to give to the Ministry of Information the co-operation they give to one another.A particularly bad case is that of Madagascar. This operation exemplified,in a pre-eminent degree, the combination of political with military considerations,and consequently required the most careful propaganda treatment. Suchpropaganda must, of course, be devised in advance. Yet the Ministry of Informa-tion was kept in ignorance of the project until the 4th May, the day beforeoperations began. As no plans had been laid in advance for adequate coverageeither by newspapermen, news photographers or newsreel men, all stories of thiseagerly welcomed operation, except for communiques and the brief statement inthe House, have perforce been based on Vichy and enemy sources. The War Office,as a result of representations made by this Ministry, now possess a large numberof well-trained photographers in uniform. They have also a number of first-classreporters. If a few of these men, under the charge of a conducting officer, hadbeen sent on this expedition, the British war effort would have received someexcellent and much needed publicity.No amount of energy or goodwill nowr, no flying of correspondents to the spota week after the event, can undo the initial harm to our cause, or make up for losttime. It is true that a photographer and a newsreel man., both of unknownqualifications, have apparently made their way to the Island. But this is no realmitigation of the failure, since no consultation wras possible as to the use to whichthey should be put or as to how their material should be transmitted with reason-able speed to the outside world or how it was to be censored.The Admiralty and War Office cannot plead &quot; security reasons &quot; for theirfailure to take the Ministry of Information, or even their own D.P.Rs., into consultation. The arrangements for taking correspondents on secret operations are complete and stringent, and their efficiency has been convincingly demon-demonstrated on several important combined expeditions, and in various battles in theMiddle East and elsewhere.The rumour that a Daily Mail reporter had managed to secure a passage from Durban in a troop ship going to Madagascar reached the Ministry ofInformation on the 7th May from Fleet Street. The Admiralty had no knowledgeof this and the reply they received to an enquiry they made was to the effect thatno newspaperman was with the expedition. However, a week after our forces had landed in Madagascar they received information confirming the truth ofthis rumour.[23821]
2This is a striking commentary on the effectiveness of the &quot; security reasons &quot;which the Admiralty and the War Office constantly plead for their failure totake the Ministry of Information into consultation. The fact that a strayjournalist in Durban could ascertain that troop ships were leaving for Madagascarand secure a place on one of them without any conditions being attached to his activities should be a matter of great concern to the Cabinet. It should also show the hollowness of the eternal &quot;security&quot; justification for refusing properlycontrolled facilities for the Press.The conclusion is inescapable that the Admiralty and the War Office stillfail to give proper weight to the moral factor inherent in all military operations,or to pi&apos;provide the information necessary for directing world opinion to our advantage.The Prime Minister&apos;s Memorandum of July 1941 (W.P. 149) records theCabinet decision that it is the duty of the Service Ministers to keep the Ministerof Information fully supplied writh all the news and information at their disposal.It is apparent that the Service Departments are unwilling to interpret this dutyas requiring them to impart even to the highest officials of this Ministry advance information essential to the carrying out of the functions it is asked to perform.It is for the War Cabinet to decide whether the work of the Ministry conductedunder such a handicap is, in the middle of the third year of the war, worth themoney and man-power that is being expended on it.If the War Cabinet direct that this handicap is to be removed, it will thenbe the duty of the Service Departments to impart information about forthcoming-joint operations to two individuals. One is a civilian, the other a military officer.These are Mr. 6. J. Radcliffe, K.C.. the Director-General of the Ministry ofInformation, and Major-General the Horn E. F. Lawson, the Chief military adviser.B. B.May 14, 1942.
