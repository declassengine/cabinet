Reference personal and secret telegram OZ 175of 8/5 from Prime Minister to General Auchi.nlecic.2. We realise you can view situation as a whole,and are therefore in much better position than we to assessvalue of results likely to accrue from earlier offensive- .in Libya, and therefore the risks which it is justifiable to run to gain these results.     Nevertheless, we feel thatwe.must once again bring to your notice certain consider-ations which we are not repeat not sure we have adequatelystressed,3. First in regard to Malta.    We realise its importance, but do not repeat not, in the light of the most recent information in our possession, consider that its fall(much though this would be deplored) would necessarily be fatal to security of Egypt for a very long period if at all,provided our supply lines through the Indian Ocean remainuninterrupted.   t In its present almost completely neutral-ised state, Malta has very little influence on the enemymaintenance situation in North Africa, though it is con-taining large enemy air forces.     The regaining of Cyrenaica,ty,us, though it would greatly assist the movement of our ships to and from Malta in the Eastern Mediterranean cannot Repeat not of itself guarantee the restoration to Maltaor its offensive power in the event of the enemy continuing to devote large air forces to its neutralisation.     This is merely an expression of opinion./4. Secondly

zx Secondly.   It would, be most dangerous to assume that, having launched an offensive in the latter half ofMay ?we can count on being able to operate aircraft fromlanding grounds near Eenghasi before the end of June oreven later/ depending on the degree of resistanceofferee, by the enemy, and the tactical results obtained on the battlefield, neither of which can be&apos; foreseen.We do not war not need to stress the fact thatthe rate of progress of any offensive undertaken againsta well led, well armed and determined enemy, without themeasure of superiority which experience has proved to bedesirable, can not repeat not be foretold with any de-gree of accuracy.   For supply reasons alone it is&quot;most,unlikely that we can establish ourselves firmly in cyrenaica within two months of starting an offensive,and it may well need a longer period than this.5. Thirdly,   v/e feel that to launch an offensivewith inadequate armoured forces may very well resultin the almost complete destruction of those troops, inview of our experience in the last Cyrenaican campaign..;Te can not war not hope to hold the defensive positionswe have prepared covering Egypt however strong we may bein infantry against a serious&apos;enemy offensive unless we can dispose of a reasonably strong armoured- force in reserve, which we should not war not then have.   Thisalso was proved last December,&quot;&quot;and will always be so interrain such as the Western Desert, where the southerntalk (f any defensive position west of the El Alamoin-Dattara   depression position must be open to attack andencirclement.   In this connection we invite your attentionto Para, second of personal telegram CS/849 for CCSfrom V.C. I.G.S. sent from Cairo on 22nd March 1942.v?Q still feel that the risk to Egypt incurred bjpiecemeal destruction of our armoured forces whica may result from -a premature offensive may be more tserious anamore immediate than that involved in the. possible lossof Malta, serious though this would be.6. Fourthly.   You mention the possibility of anenemy offensive against us early in June,   There arecertain though not repeat not very definite indications of this from the information at our disposal, ana we are naturally watching it closely and continually.   Wwould point out that if the enemy could be induced toattack us with the forces now at his disposal in our existing strong positions, while we retain our existingarmoured forces in reserve behind them, it might, very well be the best thing that could happen.   vfc are notrpt not afraid of this eventuality and hope Ghat it itmaterialises we can so damage his armoured forces as togive us a good chance of passing to the counter offensive,and possibly thereby achieving our object, which is to destroy his forces, and particularly his armoured forces,in Cyrenaica before he can withdraw them westwards and^X-   kL    (h^e-K

AHNEX;Extract from Tel.  CS/849.    22/5..Factors governing holding of positions in bulge ofOyrenaioa and plans for limited offensive:    When the idea ofa limited offensive was conceived originally the enemy wasthoug.it not to have the whole of his armour forward as he now seem:: ho have.    In present cireuros bancos ... limitedoffensive is likely tc demand the same relative superior lbin tanks as a major offensive aimed at securing Cyrenaica.;and has therefore nothing to recommend it over the latterrexcept that administratively it might be possible-e earlier.,There is nothing to prevent a limited offensive aimed at sercuring the general line Derna-Mechili from developing .:ntca major battle which would have to be fought on ground ofthe enemy&apos;s choosing..    It might, if successful.- offer-opportunity for a further advance, but only if theadministrative situation permitted.,    If it did permit ofa further advance, there would be no object in limiting thescope of the offensive.    It is possible also that a limitedoffensive equally with a major offensive might result infailure, which would certainly entail retreat to our positions round Gazala and Tobruk, and possibly to those onthe Salum-Maddalena line.    The security of both   thesepositions or of any similar defensive positions dependsultimately on the existence within trie position of anadequate armoured force which can counter-attack any enemy armoured troops which succeed in penetrating the positionor passing - round it.    If, therefore, our.offensive failsthrough lack of requisite superiority in tanks and ourarmoured force is consequently greatly reduced or destroyed,as is likely to happen in such circumstances, it is unlikelythat we should be able to hold our prepared positionsstrongly entrenched and mined as they are for more than alimited period.    This has been amply proved by experience.
