(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).42g E Q.-R E T.W.P.(42)  199.    - COPY NO.j^1STH MAY.  194S.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES OP ALUMINIUM TO RUSSIA.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Aircraft production.Under the protocol of last Autumn we agreed toprovide 2,000 tons per month to Russia for the nine month sending June,  1942.    The whole of this,  namely 18,000 tons,together with 5,000 tons snipped before the date of the protocol,  has now been shipped.2. A preliminary investigation showed that for the twelve months commencing July,  1942 we should be able to spare for Russia a further total amount of 12,000 tons,without reducing our stocks appreciably below the 50,000tons which we consider we should maintain as a reserve in thiscountry and which is onl?y 2^ months supply at peak issueperiod,    This tonnage was offered at the rate fo 1,000&apos; tons amonth for twelve months or alternatively at the rate of 2,000tons for six months.    The offer was put forward by the Ministerof Production,   (W.P.(48)178) and endorsed (D.O.(42)13ih Meeting)at the meeting of the Defence Committee (Operations)  on29th April.50 A review of the position,,based on details of forwardprogrammes which have now become available, shows, however,that a total allocation of 12,000 tons, over the year inquestion (July 1942 - June 1943) would reduce our reservestock to 39,000 tons at the end of that period.    Moreover,from the beginning of 1943 onwards the gap between estimated requirements and visible supply progressively widens,  so that by the end of 1945 stocks would have further fallen to 31,000tons, while in 1944 our stocks would have been completelyexhausted shortly after midsummer.4. A table summarizing the position for the period inquestion is attached.    It assumes that our loon to the U.S.will be repaid, that the bauxite required for the canadian and U.K. Aluminium programmes will be forthcoming whenneeded ( there is at present considerable doubt on this point)and that allowances for supply contingencies in 1943,  and for supply and requirement contingencies in 1944, will not be exceeded.5. On this basis we could not, without some risk, releaseany more aluminium to Russia.-1-

6, The Allied  Supplies Executive are anxious that we shouldnot withdraw our offer to release a total of 18,000 tons overthe year in question.    I am myself prepared to accept the riskand stand by the offer,  if it be made with the two provisionsI originally attached to it, namely that it is dependent onthe U.S. Authorities repaying the aluminium we have loaned tothem and on sufficient bauxite being shipped to Canada tomaintain the full rate of production there.    In view, however,of the position disclosed since the question was firstsubmitted, I have thought it right to submit the matter forconsider at: on by the War Cabinet,7. I propose to explore in the immediate -future the meansof covering our own cumulative deficiency by additional supplies from Canada and Q.S.A.  in 1943 and 1944,J, J,L10Great George Street, S.W,1,,12TH MAY, 1943.ESTIMATED SUPPLY, REQUIREMENTS AMD M,AjOP VIRGIN ALUMINIUM.1st July 1942 to 31st December 1944 in six-monthly periods.(long tons)TOTALSUPPLIESREQUIREMENTS.M.A.P,  STOCK,Total U.Ks RussianRequire-       Allo-me nt:cation2nd A - 1942    109,100      111,3006,000Grand iEstimatedTotal   ] Opening.117,500 I 56,146Closing.54,6421st &apos;  - 1943    115,900    1 123,2006,0002nd I - 1943    117,400    j 125,400129,200125,40054,64239,3421st   w 1944    113.V60    1 137,385137,8852nd   - 1944    117,370     137,885137,885JL39.34231,34231,3427,2177,21713,398Note.    4-   Includes allowance for repayment of loan to U.S.A.-2-
