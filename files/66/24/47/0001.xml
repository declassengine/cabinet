Benthall.Lord Linlithgow first made this recommendation early inthe year.   Its purpose was two-fold; (i) to retain unimpairedthe impartial European element afforded by three European(official) members whose number was about to be reduced bythe appointment of Sir Andrew Clow as Governor of Assam;(ii) to establish the principle that in a future wholly&quot;political&quot; Government of India the very important Europeanbusiness element in the Indian polity should reasonably berepresented.Attention was drawn to this particular recommendationof Sir E. Benthall in VI.?.(42) 53 in which I submitted to PneCabinet the Viceroy&apos;s comprehensive proposals for there-construction of his Council, and these proposals (includingspecifically the inclusion of a representative of theEuropean community) were approved by the War Cabinet on 5thFebruary (V/.M.(42) 16 Conclusion 2),The consequential invitation was made to Sir E. Benthalland after some delay (due to domestic difficulties) accepts^by him; but before any further steps could be taken to carryinto effect it or the rest of the Viceroy&apos;s proposals, the /mission of the Lord Privy Seal to India intervened. &apos;L *.

91 0(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S- -GOVERNMENT).WAR CABINETCOMMITTEE ON INDIA.Proposed Rc constitution of the Governor-general  executive Council,I circulate, for the information of the Committee, atelegram containing the Viceroy&apos;s proposals for there constitution of his Executive Council,   The strength ofthe Council was raised to twelve (including the Commander-in-Chief) last year.    Two vacancies now exist through the death of Sir Akbar Hydari and the appointment of Sir Andrew Clow tothe governorship of Assam.   In-view of the outcome of therecent negotiations the Viceroy now proposesto fill these twovacancies, to acid three further seats&apos;to his Council (  (l)war transport, (2) Defence Co-ordination on lines proposed by sir stafford Cripps In the recent discussions, but subject to theCommander-in-Chief&apos; s views, and (3) a member without portfolioto be the British Indian representative with the War cabinet and on the Pacific War Council In. London), and to select forthe five appointments representative non-officials notassociated with the leading political parties.I attach a statement showing the present and theproposed appointments, with brief notes on the proposed;&apos;new members.    These include a representative non-officialEuropean whom the Viceroy is very anxious to Include in his council.   Only two officials remain, apart from the Commander-in-Chief. but the statutory requirements of the Government ofIndia Act,, Ninth Schedule, s.3S(3), are met by Sir Firoa KhanNoon having been, at least ten years in the service of theCrown in India.I commend - the Viceroy&apos;s proposals and,.subject to anyfurther recommendation he may make as regards the defence -ordination portfolio, would wish to be in a -oo sit ion to endorse them as early as possible.L.S.A.INDIA OFFICE,5th May 1942.From     ..viceroy to ....     Secretary of State for india dated    ....     3rd May 1942.1215rS - -----------Personal.   Following are my provisional conclusions asregards reconstitution of my Council,r1.     Folio w i n g v a c a. n c i e s ha v e to be- cons id ere d :(a) Information; (b) Communications, consequent on promotion of Clow; (c) new portfolio of War Transport to be taken outof present Communications Department; (d) War Cabinet andPacific Council; (e) Defence Co-ordination, if such a oort-folio is to be established,Secret6th MaX2942

2.2,     Appointment of British Indian representative to WarCabinet and Pacific Council (I assume same individual will  - -fill both, plus a Prince) falls to be made by Governor-General in Council under Prime Minister&apos;s statement.Remainder will be made in ordinary course on my recommendation.3.     As new blood I have following in view:- (a) MohamedUsman-  (b) Benthal1; (c) Ambedkar; (d) A Sikh, Jogendra Singh;(e) I am very anxious to get someone in who will at once beof good quality and have had some recent active connection.with States.   I- should be averse to Mirza Ismail whoincidentally would give us two Shias out of three Mohamodans,and my strong disposition is to go for CP. Rama^swarii Aiyar andtry to find a really competent Dewan for Travancore in hispiace5 s.g. Gyan Nath from Jaipur,4. As regards allocation of portfolios that must depend verylargely on decision as regards War Cabinet and.Pacific Council,I am greatly attracted by possibility of sending Mudaliar. Reis of first class quality end would be a very great loss to my council in terms of ability? but I think he might himself feelthat he was more in the centre&quot;of things if he were holdingthis post..  .5,     The next Question for.consideration is whether or not weshould have a Defence Co-ordination portfolio.   Such a port-folio with content envisaged in Cripps discussions has been agood deal blown on here.   For all that, I think there is agreat deal to be said for establishing it.   I will look again at content proposed in Cripps discussions for Defence Depart-ment in- case I have any suggestion to make and will discuss with Chief.&apos; Subject to that, my considered recommendation toyou would be in favour of a Defence Co-ordination Departmentto be held by a non-official Indian probably with very much the same content as proposed in Cripps discussions, though weshould have to safeguard any weak points in formulas thenproposed, the Commander-in-Chief to remain Defence Member.6.    .0n assumption that you agree to recommendation inpreceding paragraph the communal aspect of division of moreimportant new posts has to be considered.   If we decide to sendMudaliar to Washington and London (especially if Princelyrepresentative were Jam Sahib and so a Hindu), i shall be under very strong (?^omission) to find an active war appoint-ment for a Moslem.    I cannot take Supply from Mody, and whileRaghavendra Rao1s health continues to cause me serious concern,matters havenot yet reached a point at which he can properly be relieved of Civil Defence.   I have always been anxious to putFiroz into Information, which I think he would, do admirably,and which has a general political flavour which might appeal tohim.   But if we were to send Mudaliar home then I think that Ishould, do better to put Firoz - into new Defence portfolio.That would incidentally Fe some recognition of&quot; tEe &quot;part played by the Punjab, while relatively limited content of Defenceportfolio might be some consolation to Sikendar for not being brought in to fill it.7,     Proceeding from those assumptions, we should have available (a) Commerce; (b) Information; (c) War Transport:(d) Communications and (e) Labour.   For Labour, Arabedkar, withhis labour connections is a strong candidate.8.     For Commerce I think Sarker (here again his health is notyet quite firmly re-established) is probably our best choice in succession to Mudaliar.   lie is actively interested, in commercial and. financial sides and has repeatedly, made it clear to me that while he will do his best in Education, Health end

Lands that is not really-his country.   He would be taking aphysical risk in assuming so heavy a department as Commerce,and I should have to v/arn him before giving it to him that he must be prepared to do a 12-hour day,   But if he is preparedto take a chance of risks involved then I would let him haveCommerce, for which he is admirably qualified.9.     For Education, Health.and Lands vice Barker if appointedto Commerce, Jogondra Singh would I think be quite a goodselection.10.     The balance of present Communications-portfolio afterWar Transport has been taken out could go to Sir MuhammadUsman.11.     That would leave us with Information for C,P.RamaswemiAiyar.   Given the great political importance of Information,i think we could reasonably expect him to be satisfied with it.   I am much inclined to re-name portfolio &quot;Public Relations&quot;.12.     War Transport would go to Benthall.    (We should be under some criticism on the ground that we have emasculated the communications portfolio and given better haig of it to a european but I think we can probably face that).13, We shall have provided for Sikhs and Scheduled Castes by arrangements suggested above,        \14.     Firoz Khan Noon was appointed a Minister of Punjab on 3rd January 1927 and (2 corrupt groups) served continuously inthat capacity until July 1st 1936.   He has been in my Councilsince October 21st 1941 and thus satisfies service criterion.We need not therefore make a temporary appointment to succeedClow and can wait until permanent man is&apos; available.    I would propose that Roy should carry on as Secretary in the meantime,it Is essential, however, that Benthall. should be here as soonas possible, particularly as his seniority in Council will depend on his date of arrival,   Risk of any real hitch hereover his apoointment I would judge to be small, and I suggestthat, on assumption that he will get War Transport and be willing to take it, he should be flown out at earliest possible moment so as to be on the spot when vacancy is announced,15.     I should be grateful for earliest possible indication ofyour reaction, as it is important now to get ahead, and I can take no soundings of anyone until I know that you agree.

From     ...     Secretary of State for IndiaTo-       ...     ViceroyDespatched    -12th-May 1942.3.     There was general approval of your proposal to bring in Ramaswami Ayyar but it was suggested that his undoubtedability might be used to fuller advantage in importantpost of civil defence if Rao vacates.   But I do not ov r-look great importance of the Information portfolio nor thevalue of filling it by someone knowledgeable about Statjsquestions.   I was also urged to ask you to see if youcouldn&apos;t find a young and intelligent Sikh.instead ofJogendra, even if of comparatively junior standing.H.3. Malik&apos;s name cropped up in that connection.    imagine you could spare him from New York now, but I realise it might not bo practicable from point of view ofhis service standing,4.    &apos;We are agreed that Mudaliar is the best choice forhere.    It may not be easy to find him really enough to dooutside the weekly Cabinet meetings and: less regular-meetings of Pacific Council and Defence Committee.   But Idaresay I can arrange a good deal outside and we may eventually have to revert to your original idea of arotation of your members,5,     I am not quite sure that you have realised that thereare two Pacific Councils,   There is one at Washingtonwhich is run by the President and the combined Chiefs ofPrivate and personal.    I have now discussed your1215-3 fully with-Cabinet India Committee.   Committee areunanimously opposed to Benthall,   They consider his business connections might be open to criticism.   They do.not feel that European commercial community would, really- &quot;like appointment either in itself, or because of resultantcriticism which might be directed against them collective-ly.   These objections might be off-set by Benthall being a real expert on transport, but that is not the-case.   Ifa transport expert is required, the view held, was that thereal solution would, be to keep Communications Departmentundivided as at present and. if Commander-in-Chief feelsit desirable, having regard, to the existence of theRailway Board, to attach to it for war transport purposessome really first-rate technical man.   It seems to methat there is much force in these views and I do not think you should press idea of including Benthall any further.2.     On question of dividing Defence portfolio ourconclusion was in favour provided that you and Wavell -really feel that it is a good thing on merits and notmerely a political move.    If it is justified administratively-ively and the new defence co-ordination member finds hereally has work of Importance to do that would incident-ally dispose of the charge that Cripps only offered a&quot;comic11 department.; failing that its creation would obviously tell just the other way.    If created ourpreference would be also to follow the change of titlessuggested by Cripps and. call Wavell War Member, but Ihave no strong view as to that and it might have-implications read into it In india that would proveinconvenient later on.

Staff.   So far the President has not agreed to India beingrepresented.   If and*when he does it will presumably be byBajpal.   The other meets here and includes Dutch, Chinese,Canadian, -Australian, New Zealand and probably American,It is at present rather dormant, meeting occasionally toimportance until we are nearer to the point of recoveringnaval control of the Indian Ocean and of assuming the( offensive against lost Allied territories.6.     I think the above will have given you sufficientguidance as to the Cabinet view and you can now go ahead,with the actual rcconstitution as you think best.7.     We had discussion also on the Question of&quot;non-official advisers In the Provinces and agreed&apos;that thereIs no reason why Governors should not make such appoint-ments wherever suitable individuals are available.   Ithink you might take this up preferably on the lines of1-Iallett&apos;s letter of 13th April, excluding law and. orderresponsibilities and finding places so far as possibledirectly in relation to war questions.   Possibly suitable persons could be found from among those who took office in the provisional governments formed at the outset in19 37 which also perhaps might afford a fruitful field forany candidates you may still raouire for your Executive,more important of course would be restoration of populargovernment in Madras if i-te j ago pa lac bar i can pull It off.OUTWARD TELEGRAM from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy,dated 12th May, 1942.Private and personal1.   My private and personal telegramNo. 595 dated 12th May ^paragraph 3.   If Kao&apos;s portfolio has tobe filled, whether by rtamaswami Ayyar as Committee suggest or bynew selection, it occurs to me that it might be worth while to consider for it or for information Member KrlshnamaAcharia or Gopalaswami Ayyangar from Kashmir.   They both have much administrative experience and apparently either wouldfulfil requirement of ton years&apos; Crown Service, whileneither would overlook States factor.   But of courseinclusion of either would add to already considerablerepresentation of Madras and Chetty is in the offing for599any further vacancy.

INWARD   TELEGRAM.From. ...... viceroy to........  Secretary of State for India.Despatched 18.. 30 hours, 20th May, 1942.Personal.        Your telegram of May 12th 595 re  constitutionof my Council.      I am grateful to you and to Cabinet india committee for your comment to which I have given fullest weightthough on certain important aspects I do not find it convincing..Before commenting on details I would premise that responsibilityfor running this Council and keeping it together must fall on theGovernor-General and that in my opinion,  save where reallydecisive arguments can be advanced against, his judgment inregard to selection of personnel should be allowed to prevail.You need not fear that I shall not give the fullest weight toviews expressed by you and by the Cabinet  India Committee,    Butif against my judgment and against my considered advice I amurged and agree to take certain decisions either to accept orreject individuals you will not overlook that responsibilityfor failure would fall upon me..      I think it essential that my view.: should in these circumstances prevail save, as I say,where really decisive arguments which are  convincing can be advanced to the  contrary.2.      Benthall.    I fear I do not agree with the view expressed by you and by Committee,.      There  is already considerable speculationhere in Indian press  .is to probability of Benthall being appointed-.Only argument taken against is that his appointmentmeans ar- impediment in process of full and. immediate India nisati on.He is not perhaps entirely outstanding and you and I are quiteaware  of his weak points.      But it is a case of now or never so faras representation of non-official European community is concerned.I see no-one in the field preferable   to Benthall.   .F.E. James isa- possible  name.      But he would be grieviously distrusted byimportant sections of Europeans.    Nor could I myself (though i recognise his good qualities)  regard him as a dependable man forthe  Council.      I remain therefore of my opinion that Benthall(whose selection you have yourself in the past consistentlysupported and who I gather from you is willing to serve)  should go&quot;to War Transport Portfolio.    l\jy mind is however open to theextent that I would be prepared to consider him for anotherPortfolio if necessary, and if you have any comment on that aspectI shall be glad to have it.      I think there is a very strong caseon merits for splitting communications which in present formis an intolerably heavy charge,  and War Transport aspect is of very great importance.    Moreover the splitting need not be permanent and can be stated to be for war period only.    I would only add that Benthall is of far higher calibre for administrativepurposes than in my opinion any Indian available  in India.What I need (and this has been my object in looking for Benthall)is someone who can work hard and get Europeans and Indians topull together in improving transport picture.

I have no reason to regard ourselves as sMort of technicalskill in Railway field.    Also I want as you will appreciateto keep division better balanced between Hindus and Moslems than   can gut from Moslem members by themselves.3.      Defence  Co-ordination.      I have discussed with Wavell.I should have thought it was obvious that this was essentially political matter (and entirely so if in that category weinclude more public confidence and support in garrison forcesin all regards),  and that merits must be subordinate..There is risk as I have already made  clear to you thatestablishment of this Portfolio with functions substantiallycomparable  to those  suggested in Cripps discussions will come under some  criticism as being an un-reality.    I do not attachtoo much importance to that.    I think that its creationwould be a useful gesture and would contribute to soothing politicalfeeling here.      The Commander-in-Chief agrees with me thatdecision is essentially political.    He would be quite preparedto work to a Defence Co-ordination Portfolio but urgesthat if it is to be  created it should be filled by Firoz KhanNoon since he has not requisite  confidence in Sikendar.    With that view I agree and I think that Fir.oz would do it admirably,  andwould fit in very well indeed with the Army.    There would be-further advantage that if as  I trust Mudaliar accepts WarCabinet vacancy we should balance selection of a Hindu for london by selection of a Punjab Moslem for Defence Portfolio.4.      CP. Ramaswami Aiyar.      I am very glad you agree.    I doubtif it matters whether&apos;he goes to Civil Defence  or Information.Decision must wait until we know whether Rao is handed over or not.5.      Sikh..    You may rest assured that  I have fine combed thiscommunity during last couple  of years in consultation with party,Craik and all those competent here to advise me about Sikhmatters.       It is lamentably short of men of least quality.Strongest candidate on merits is probably Baldey Singh, but thereis reason to think that he may be wanted for Punjab Ministry andthere was earlier reason to suspect that he might be much more ofa quisling in certain circumstances than we could contemplate.As my telegrams will have snown you T am fully alive toweaknesses of Jogcndra Singh,  and were we considering meritsonly there would be no question of my taking any Sikh at all.As it is,  general feeling is that he is by far best compromiseand I accept that view.    To appoint H..S.. Malik would produce anoutcry.    Pie is a very junior Indian civilian of average Qualitythough considerable personal charm.    We shall be accused ofmaintaining service minimum by back door and apart from thathe is not  of standing to carry requisite weight here..    I holdtherefore to Jogendra Singh for Sikh vacancy.6.      Your private and personal telegram May 12th No. 599..    I agree with you that to put either Krishnamachariar or GopalaswamiAiyangar in addition to CP. Ramaswami Aiyar would (a)  over-weighMadras  (b)   over-weigh representation of people who might beregarded as speaking with, special knowledge of States interest.If we  are to have a second man of that type  Chetty is by far best,7.      I ?/ill let you have final conclusions once  I get a definite answer from Mudaliar.    Meantime however I am much tempted byidea of using Begum Shah Nawaz if I could fit her in.    Onlycomplications are  (a)  that she would mean a fourth Moslem inCouncil (the remainder being Firoz Khan Noon, Mohamed Usman andSultan Ahmed),   (b)  that it might suggest Punjab was overrepre sente d/

r; 9 4represented given fact that we would have Fircz Khan Noon and aSikh, and that if there was to be another Punjab representativeit ought to be a non-Moslem.&apos;   I am not sure that either is necessarily decisive and my&apos; main difficulty which may be insuperable is finding a Portfolio for her.     My general opinion Is that her appointment would do no harm at the moment.We have had no help from Congress or its friends.    The Moslemson the other hand have been of real assistance despite Jinnah&apos;sintransigence:    and we might be able to get round suggestionthat we were over-weighing their representation in theExecutive  Council if wc appoint the Begum by taking the line that she was a representative of women and not Moslems.    Butmy mind is open and&quot;I should welcome your reaction before considering further.
