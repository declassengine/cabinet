THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1942.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (32) 182.April 30, 1942.WAR CABINET.HITLER&apos;S SPEECH OF APRIL 26, 1942.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs.IN accordance with War Cabinet Conclusions 53 (42) 3 of the 27th April,1942, I circulate to my colleagues herewith a memorandum, prepared in theForeign Office, on Hitler&apos;s speech to the Reichstag on the 26th April, 1942.A. E.Foreign Office, April 30, 1942.- ANNEX.THE general reaction of world opinion to Hitler&apos;s speech of the 26th Aprilis that it is tantamount to an admission of serious internal difficulties inGermany.   This judgment should be accepted with reserve.The central point of the speech was Hitler&apos;s assumption of drastic newpowers, which were defined in the following statement which Goring asked the deputies to confirm : &quot; There can be no doubt that the Fiihrer, at this time when the Germanpeople is engaged in a war of &apos; to be or not to be,&apos; must possess the right hehas claimed to do everything which serves to achieve victory or contributes toit. The Fiihrer must, therefore, in his capacity as Ftihrer of the nation, as commander-in-Chief of the army, as the supreme holder of executive power, as supreme Law Lord and as leader of the Party, unfettered by existing laws orprocedure, at all times be in a position, if necessary, to compel every German,whether soldier or officer, high or low, official or judge, official of the Party,worker or employee, by all means he deems suitable, to fulfil his duty and, inthe event of his neglecting his duty, duly to punish him after thorough examination without regard to so-called duly acquired rights, and especially to relieve him of his rank or office without instituting the prescribed proceedings.&quot;2. There has undoubtedly been a decline in German civilian morale (as opposed to the morale of the German army) over the past six months. Thishas been due partly to the overshadowing threat of the Russian armies andto the heavy losses suffered on the Eastern Front; partly to the dawningrealisation that the war is likely to be long and in the end not necessarily a victorious one; and partly to the steady deterioration in living conditions inGermany. Hitler has been obliged for the first time to take public accountof this state of affairs. It must be remembered, however, that after three wintersof total war discontent, grumbling and war weariness are to be expected, and11703   [23765J
it would be dangerous to regard Hitler&apos;s speech as an admission of seriousinternal difficulties in Germany. No doubt there have been murmurs of discontentin Church and Army, Civil Service and Judiciary, but there are no grounds for belief that these murmurs, though obviously a source of anxiety, have yet reached serious proportions. On the contrary, there is evidence to show thatthe German people as a whole have fully accepted the idea assiduously propagatedby Dr. Goebbels that the next few months will very likely settle the fate ofEurope for centuries to come, and that in this historic conflict Germany cannot afford to lose. There is indeed a general expectation that the German army willwin spectacular victories in the East, but there is also widespread doubt whether these victories will be final. While the prospect of a fourth war winter causesdismay, none the less the German people at present undoubtedly still standunited behind Hitler and will follow where he leads. Nor are there any grounds for anticipating that such discontent as exists aims at actively prejudicing thesuccess of the coming Eastern offensive.3. During the past three or.four months the whole German war machinehas been geared up to maximum efficiency. There has been a ruthless drive to mobilise all available man-power and woman-power and to increase war production. The administrative machine has been subjected to the severeststrain and weaknesses have certainly come to light. It would accordingly be wise to regard Hitler&apos;s assumption of drastic new powers primarily as the culmination of this all-out drive, and possibly as a precautionary step against future developments rather than as evidence of the sadden appearance of freshinternal difficulties. For every reason, it is essential for Hitler to force the issuethis summer and to achieve results which, though not necessarily conclusive thisyear (he implicitly foretells another war winter), may make an ultimate Alliedvictory extremely difficult. Thus the commitment to victory on the Eastern Frontis made more precise. The war against England is the submarine war. Duringthe next four or five months Hitler intends to extract the last ounce of strengthfrom the whole German people, and he will allow no one and nothing to stand inhis way. (The cherished privileges and rights of the Civil Service and the judiciary are specially emphasised.) Hitler has therefore armed himself with full powers to remove summarily the recalcitrant and the weaker vessels. Nodoubt he is gambling on having achieved by the autumn such a degree of successas to enable him then to relax his pressure on the German people. If the gamblefails, the reaction will no doubt be proportionately serious. But even in that event the country is likely to be held so firmly in the grip of the Party and the secret Police that a gigantic effort, or a great disaster, will be required to break the shackles.4. Another point besides Hitler&apos;s assumption of the role of Supreme LawLord should be noted. This is the long introductory section on England. In itHitler was at pains to point out that England must in any case lose this warsince at the end of it her Allies would be stronger than she. Thus the war,whether Germany or Britain won, spelt catastrophe for the British Empire.From this Hitler developed a direct appeal to the peace-party he has alwaysbelieved to exist in this country : *- -. &quot; I do not know whether to-day all English people regard it as wise tohave rejected the numerous offers of an understanding which I have madesince 1933; whether they are to-day all convinced that it was very wise torefuse my offer of alliance which I renewed on the 1st September, 1939, and my offers of peace which I made after the Polish and French campaigns./ &apos; But I know another law that man must himself overthrow what the godshave destined for destruction.   So what will be must be.&quot;Hitler is no doubt hereby pursuing his familiar technique of attempting to spread confusion and dissension on the eve of a major offensive.. 5. On the whole the speech followed the familiar pattern of the Hitleriandiscourse : the pseudo-historical exordium, the frenzied anti-Semitism, the abuse of the democratic leaders, the sarcasm at the democratic methods of waging war,and, above all, the ever-closer identification of the Fiihrer with every aspect ofthe national life of the German people on the one hand, and with the will of theAlmighty on the other.A.
