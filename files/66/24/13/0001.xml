Submarine Upholder, Commander Wanklyn, V.C., D.S.O., is overduefrom patrol and must be considered lost.In air attacks on Malta between the 26th and 27th, HM. Drifter Trusty Starwas damaged and two tugs were sunk.It is estimated that some 18,000 tons of enemy shipping was sunk or seriously damaged during the week by our aircraft.  Details are given in the Air Situation.During the week upwards of 4,500 tons of French merchant shipping east-bound passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. Fourteen attacks on U-boats were carried out during the week : six by warships and eight by aircraft. In no case was there definite evidence of destruction.Surface craft, including Canadian, Free French and two American ships,made attacks off the American and Canadian. Atlantic coasts, in the Mediter-ranean and to the southward of Liberia. A.n attack was also carried out by oneof H.M. submarines in the Mediterranean.Aircraft, including one American, made attacks to the north and west ofthe Hebrides, to the south-west of Ireland, in the Mediterranean and off theAmerican Atlantic coast.Enemy Intelligence.German.6.   No change has been reported in the position of main units.Italian.:&apos;&quot;&apos; A total of some 150,000 tons of shipping has reached Libya from Italy duringthe past month. This is a very considerable increase on the average of theprevious5 three months.
U-Boats.The main concentration has continued to be in the Western Atlantic and the carribbean Sea. There has been little activity off the Canadian coast. ItalianU-boats have been operating off the north coast of Brazil and to the southwardof Freetown.Japanese.Further reinforcements of Japanese warships to the Southern MandatedIslands confirm the indications of intended activity in the south-west pacific area.A new aircraft-carrier, the Ryakuku, has joined the Japanese fleet. It isnot known whether she is an aircraft-carrier proper or a converted merchant ship.Protection of Seaborne Trade.7. During the week ending the 29th April, 1,060 ships, including 279 allied and 22 neutral, have been convoyed.Two cruisers, five anti-aircraft ships, 76 destroyers (including nine American)and 93 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including five American) were employed on escort duties.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 25th April totalled 721,000 tons, compared with 679,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 595,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports 255,000 tons were oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Trade.8. Seven ships, including two tankers, are known to have been torpedoedby U-boats during the week : five in the Western Atlantic, and two in the carribbean Sea. Of these, two ships are reported to have sunk and one tankerhas reached port.One ship in coastal convoy was sunk by mine off the Humber.In addition, reports have been received of six attacks by U-boats which occurred during the preceding week. Five of these took place off the AmericanAtlantic coast and one off Libya,British Minelaying.9. During the week aircraft have laid mines in the Heligoland Bight, offthe west coast of Denmark and off Kiel.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.10. E-boats are believed to have laid a minefield in the East Coast WarChannel off the Humber during the night of 21st/22nd.Twenty-seven mines were destroyed during the week : seventeen of them offthe Humber.The mine totals are : 2,006 magnetic, 1,264 acoustic and 1,166 moored.Foreign Waters.A dangerous area has been declared off Port Said.A searched channel has been established at Vancouver, British Columbia.Enemy Merchant Shipping.11. During the month of March only five enemy merchant ships of any sizetried to pass through the Straits of Dover. One of these, of about 2,500 tons, was sunk and a large tanker was seriously damaged, both by M.T.Bs.; the tanker was later towed into Boulogne by the enemy and beached. One ship may have been mined and sunk off Dunkirk, and two coasters were damaged by our aircraft.Vichy Merchant Shipping.12. The Belle Isle (9,591 tons), which is believed to have a cargo of rubber,left Dakar on the 18th for the northward.[23763]&apos; B
(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Finland.13. There has been a revival of activity in some sectors of the Finnish frontparticularly along the River Svir, where the Finns, in their communique of the23rd, claimed to have repulsed a series of Russian attacks and to have inflictedvery heav)^ losses. Operations do not appear to have been on a large scale and theFinnish claims are probably exaggerated.Leningrad Sector.14. There has been increased local activity in this sector, where the thawhas not yet limited operations to the same extent as elsewhere. The reduction ofthe isolated German forces in the Staraya Russa area seems now to be improbable.Central Sector.15. Local attacks and counter-attacks continue, though on a greatly reduced scale.. -Ukraine.16. Operations have been restricted to a minimum by the prevailing thawconditions.Crimea.17.   Activity has been.mainly confined to the air.Summary.18. The late thaw, particularly in the Ukraine, may well be delayingGerman preparations and may cause their offensive to be postponed until theend of May or possibly later. In the Crimea, where the Germans appear to beincreasing the scale of their air effort, military operations should be possible atan earlier date.Libya.19. Patrol activity continued during the early part of the week and ourartillery was active. At dawn on the 25th an enemy column, including tanks, was reported moving south from the area of El Telim (approximately 30 miles south-west of Gazala). This column, on being engaged by our forward columns 20 miles south-west of Segnali, turned westwards. On the 27th enemy columns were reported moving south-east from Garet El Asida (12 miles east of Bir Tengeder).One of these columns withdrew on encountering opposition from our armoured forces and, on the following day, patrols reported that the enemy was less activearound Garet El Asida.and was in smaller strength than previously.Burma.Irrawaddy and Sittang Fronts.20. When our forces crossed the Pin Chaung on 19th they sufferedcasualties and were obliged to destroy guns and transport. By the 27th theyhad withdrawn to position east and west of the Irrawaddy in the Pakkoku area.Chinese forces withdrew from Yenangyaung on the night of the 21st/22nd and arenow reported at Sagaing, south of Mandalay.By the 26th Japanese columns on both our right and left fronts had reachedthe road Kyaukpadaung-Meiktila, and were maintaining their pressure north-wards.Chinese forces previously in action at Kyidaungan were later in action southof Yamethin and then withdrew to area Meiktila-Wundwin covered by our main
forces. No reports have been received as to the present positions held by Chinese,but by the 27th main British forces were north-west and south-east of Mandalay.It is not clear how far the Japanese have advanced in this sector.Karenni Front.21. The enemy captured Loikaw after fierce fighting and were able tocontinue their advance north to Shwenyaung, where they were in contact withChinese forces on the 23rcl. Fierce fighting lasting several days took place atTaunggyi.Enemy light tanks cut the road Taunggyi-Loilem at Hopong on the 21stand, by the 24th, a mobile column had penetrated northwards towards Laihka.Latest reports were that the enemy had passed through Konghai-Ping on theroad to Ffsipaw, and were approaching Lashio district. The Chinese forces inthis area are believed to be withdrawing northwards.Summary.22. Situation reports have not been received regularly, but, although thesituation is confused, it is obvious that the enemy have made considerable progress,particularly on the eastern front, where they are thrusting towards the NorthernShan States.Intelligence.Scandinavia.23. The volume of German shipping to Norway since the end of March is consistent with the arrival of a further division in addition to some 15,000 coastaldefence troops, but no new identification has been received and it is likely thatthis increase in shipping is due to the passage of drafts through Norway to finland after a period of rest and refitment in Germany.Pending any new identification, therefore, the total of German divisions in norway remains at eight. Similarly, the total of German divisions in Finlandremains at five.In Denmark the number of German divisions is still two.France and the Low Countries.24. There has been no reliable evidence of any reinforcement of german troops in the Channel areas.Movements have been reported among the German divisions stationed in the occupied territory, but although no divisions have been identified as having been withdrawn from Russia to France to balance the recent known transfer of one division to the Eastern front and the possibility of the departure of furtherdivisions, we have to assume that the present total of 25 divisions in France andthree in the Low Countries has been maintained. These figures are, however, amaximum in each case.The Balkans and the Mediterranean.25.   There is still no evidence of an immediate attack on Turkey or Cyprus.The number of German divisions remains at four in Yugoslavia and two in greece, including Crete.Although the heavy air attacks on Malta have been maintained, there are noreliable indications of an immediate assault on the island.Far East.26. The total number of Japanese forces in the Southern area of operationsremains unchanged at twenty-nine divisions. Within this area, it is believed thatthe cessation of hostilities in the island of Luzon (Philippines) has enabled theJapanese to withdraw one division to Formosa to rest and refit. In the north,indications suggest an increase of three divisions to the Japanese strength in manchuria, making a total of twenty-three divisions. It is assumed thesereinforcements have come from Japan, and the home garrison is consequentlyreduced to six divisions.[23763] &apos; . B 2
General Review.27. In excellent weather our night-bombers heavily attacked targets inGermany and occupied territory. Raids on Rostock were particularly effective.Daylight activity by Fighter Command was intensive and combats were numerous.Enemy attacks on Malta were again on a heavy scale.Allied fighters inflicted heavy casualties on Japanese aircraft during enemyraids on Darwin, Australia and on Loiwing aerodrome, Burma.United Kingdom.28.   Fighter Command flew 4,862 sorties by day and 869 by night.29. Enemy activity against this country by day remained at the same level asin. the previous week, but by night there was a further increase, a total of 305aircraft flying inland. The chief feature of interest was the resumption, after along interval, of concentrated attacks on English towns.Ten raiders were destroyed, four were probably destroyed and 11 were damaged.30. In the attack on Bath on the night of 25th/26th, 30 to 40 per cent, ofthe available aircraft of most of the units participating made two sorties. these included aircraft of Reserve Training Units which had not taken an appreciablepart in operations over this country since May 1941.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.31. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 2,791 and 96 offensive sorties respectively, compared with 1,793 and 54 last week.Bostons and Hurricane bombers dropped 72 tons of H.E. on objectives which included the docks at Flushing, Cherbourg, Dunkirk, Havre and Calais, railway centres at St. Omer, Abbeville and Hazebrouck, power stations at Ostend andLille and aerodromes at Mardyck and Le Touquet. In most instances successful results were reported.Spitfires provided escort and cover for these attacks and carried out several large-scale sweeps. In some of these operations, the reaction by enemy fighterswas considerable. Thirty-six enemy aircraft are known to have been shot downin combat and damage was inflicted on a further 61, of which at least 19 were probably destroyed. We lost four bombers and 55 fighters; two pilots wererescued.Night.32. Bomber Command despatched 1,050 sorties against land targets corn-pared with 330 last week. Weather was generally excellent with clear visibilitywhich enabled the targets to be identified without difficulty. A tofcal of 1,013 tonsof H.E. bombs (including 61 4,000-lb.) and 464 tons of incendiaries (including 934250-lb.) were dropped.The principal effort was directed on the port of Rostock and adjacent aircraftworks, and against Dunkirk docks. The Gnome-Le Rhone factory near Paris,the naval base of Kiel, industrial targets at Cologne, and. the Tirpitz at Trondheimwere also heavily attacked.33. Our aircraft attacked Rostock on four consecutive nights and droppeda total of 270 tons of H.E. bombs and 257 tons of incendiaries on the town anda further 189 tons of bombs at Marienehe, where the factory manufacturingHeinkel aircraft is situated. A high proportion of the bombers located their objective and some aircraft bombed from less than 3,000 feet. Aircraft crews .reported extensive damage, both by blast and by fire, and these claims were subsequently confirmed by photographs. The Heinkel works was hit many times,warehouses on the waterfront and parts of the Neptune shipyards were setalight and particularly fierce fires in the old town burned for many hours.Out of a total of 470 bombers.employed on these operations only 11 aircraft are missing.
34. Bombers were also despatched on four consecutive nights to attackDunkirk and a total of 164 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped; bursts across the docks and fires in the target area were seen.35. A total of 148 tons of H.E. bombs and mines were dropped during twonight attacks on the naval base of Trondheim. It was claimed that four heavy-bombs fell near the Tirpitz, two of which were estimated as hits or very near misses. During the first of these operations, aircraft of Coastal Command carriedout successful diversionary attacks on aerodromes and R.D.F. stations in thevicinity.36. The Gnome-Le Rhone works at Gennevilliers, near Paris, was attacked by 82 aircraft, which dropped 131 tons of H.E. bombs and 20 tons of incendiaries;hits are claimed on the aero-engine works, the power station, the ThomsonHouston works and the Goodrich tyre factory. .37. During a raid on Cologne, good fires were started, some of which, after taking a firm hold, merged together.38. At Kiel, fires were reported in and near the Germania shipyards andothers were seen on the west bank of the Estuary, though detailed observationwas hampered by a smoke screen and searchlight dazzle.39.   An attack on a smaller scale was made on the docks at Ostend.Aircraft also set out to attack the Skoda armament works at Pilsen butencountered heavy cloud and, though five of them dropped their bombs, results could not be observed.40. Fighter Command and Bomber Command despatched a total of 69aircraft to patrol and attack aerodromes in Northern France, Holland andBelgium.Two enemy fighters were destroyed and two others damaged.Coastal Operations.41.   Coastal Command flew 595 sorties, of which 78 were on convoy-escort.Shipping-protection.patrols by Fighter Command involved 873 sorties.42. Anti-shipping operations included attacks, in which hits were claimed,on four Flak-ships and two merchant vessels off the French coast, a 3,500-ton merchant ship off Sylt and on two vessels off the coast of Norway.43. Extensive photographic reconnaissances were flown over coastal districtsfrom Trondheim to Lorient.44. Bomber Command despatched 25 aircraft to lay sea-mines in enemy waters.45.   Enemy activity against shipping was on a small scale.Mediterranean.Libya and Egypt.46.   During the early part of the week operations were restricted by bad weather.  Later, normal activity was resumed and our fighters provided protec-tion for shipping and carried out offensive activities in the forward area,including attacks on landing grounds, camps and M.T. vehicles.   Beaufighters..destroyed a petrol tanker and damaged several M.T. vehicles south of Benghazi.Benghazi was; attacked by Wellingtons&apos;on four nights, and mines were laid in the harbour. The quays and a ship were hit. Other Wellingtons bombed the landing grounds at Derna, Martuba, Berca and Benina.47. Tobruk was attacked twice. On the second occasion, when 15 aircraft attacked, our fighters, four of which were lost, destroyed three, probably destroyedfive and damaged the remainder. Two attacks were also made on El Daba landing-ground.Alexandria was bombed by 25 aircraft. A fire was started in the harbour and some damage was caused in the town. Three aircraft were destroyed by ourBeaufighters and A A. defences. * -
The Suez Canal area was bombed by 20 aircraft. At Kabrit a hangar wasbadly damaged, and three Wellingtons and one Lysander on the ground were destroyed.Sea Communications.48. A naval Albacore torpedoed a tanker and a 5,000-ton merchant vesseloff the Tunisian coast.A convoy, consisting of a tanker and two small merchant vessels escorted by two Do. 18s and two Cr. 42s was attacked in the Gulf of Sirte by two Beaufighters.The tanker was hit and the two Do. 18s were shot down.Wellingtons obtained bits or near misses with bombs on a south-boundmerchant vessel of 7,000 tons off Lampione, on a 5,000-ton merchant vessel off cape Bon, and on a small ship oft&apos; Benghazi.A merchant vessel of 4,000 tons on a south-easterly course was attacked with torpedoes by two Beauforts 190 miles north-north-west of Benghazi, but results were not observed.Malta.49. Enemy attacks on the Island were again on a heavy scale and were carried out by a total of 1,036 bombers escorted by fighters. The aerodromes andthe Grand Harbour were the main objectives.The aerodromes were repeatedly hit, and Hal Far was rendered temporarilyunserviceable. Fourteen of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground and 13were damaged. Several service buildings and M.T. vehicles were destroyed or damaged. In addition, serious damage was caused to civilian property, and therewas a number of casualties.Our fighters destroyed seven enemy aircraft, probably destroyed seven and damaged thirty-two. Anti-aircraft guns destroyed twenty, probably destroyedone and damaged seventeen.   We lost four fighters.Sicily.50.   Several reconnaissances were made of harbours and aerodromes in sicily.Hurricanes carried out intruder patrols over Catania and Comiso aero-dromes, and Wellingtons made three bombing attacks on the latter, startingseveral fires.   One Flurricane and two Wellingtons are missing.Crete.51.   Eighteen Wellingtons bombed Heraklion and Tymbaki aerodromes,causing fires and explosions.Russia.52.   The German Air Force has intensified its attacks against Kerch andthe Caucasian ports, and continued its attacks on Murmansk.Burma.53.   Reports of air activity are scanty.Our aircraft successfully bombed and machine-gunned enemy mechanisedcolumns between Hopong and Loilem and destroyed two enemy fighters in that area.54. Intensive dive-bombing of British troops in the Taunggyi area was reported and enemy aircraft also attacked Chinese positions 40 miles west ofNamsang. Three attacks were made on Mandalay and on Shivebo (50 miles North-west of Mandalay).

Darwin was attacked on two days, by 24 and 17 bombers respectively,escorted on each occasion by nine fighters. Severe damage to buildings, a roadwayand power lines resulted but the enemy suffered heavy casualties.
During the first raid, eight Japanese bombers and at least three fighters were destroyed by Allied fighters, four of which were slightly damaged. In the secondraid. P. 40&apos;s shot down three bombers and four fighters and probably destroyed two more fighters, for the loss of four of ours.Pacific Zone.56.

One Japanese aircraft was destroyed, four probably destroyed and five damaged.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.58. During the week increased bombing took place at night and sharpattacks were made on Exeter, Bath (twice), Norwich (twice) and York. Therehas been little damage to the national war effort but casualties have been heavy.By Day.59. Bombing and machine-gunning occurred at a few places on the south coast and the Isle of Wight. On the 2-lth minor incidents occurred at Brighton,Hastings and Bognor. On the 26th the Military Camp at Lydd was attacked and damaged, work was temporarily stopped at Betteshanger Colliery (Kent)and dislocation caused at the neighbouring Tilmanstone Colliery.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week :-Germany.Rostock. Each day following the second, third and fourth attacks daylightphotographs were obtained, and in each case smoke from the fires still burningfrom the previous night&apos;s attack hampered assessment. It is seen, however, thatthe damage is heavy and widespread. In the old town there are two large areasof devastation, one 900 by 650 yards, the other 750 by 650 yards. All the stationbuildings at the Friederich Franz railway station have been gutted and thenavigational school&apos; and the town gasworks were destroyed. At the Heinkelfactory a stick of bombs has fallen across the centre of the main assembly shop,fuselages and unfinished aircraft have been brought out on to the tarmac and the aerodrome marked as unserviceable. In addition a large workshop and the paintshop have been damaged by blast, the machine shop and the canteen damaged by fire. The offices and the technical school together with the railway line supplying the works have all been damaged. In the Neptune shipbuilding yard twobuildings have also been damaged.Cologne. Photographs taken on 15th April show new damage on both banks of the Rhine. On the east bank the principal features are damage to the HumboldtDeutz Works and to warehouses on both sides of the Industrie Hafen. On thewest bank damage has occurred mainly in the suburbs of Sulz and Ehrenfeld.Sheds adjoiningthe gasworks at Ehrenfeld have been gutted. A factory near theEifeltor Goods Yard has received a direct hit and the signal box in the goods station is seen to have been completely destroyed and an adjoining building been gutted.Ground sources report that several factories situate near the Ford Works(which is in the suburb of Niehl to the north of the town) have been damaged. Thedestruction of many buildings on the night of 13th/14th March is again confirmed.The next morning fires were still burning which were only got under control inthe afternoon. There were four serious incidents of railway damage causingsuspension of traffic. A textile factory was destroyed and the Humboldt DeutzWorks was hit in this attack.   Two hundred to 300 people were killed.Dusseldorf. Photographs taken on 15th April show that a large part of a factory engaged in the production of magnetic mines, heavy shells and bomb caseshas been demolished. In addition commercial and domestic property has been destroyed or damaged.Lubeck. It is learnt that as a result of the attack a complete embargo onthe despatch of goods via Lubeck was imposed, which was not lifted until18th April, that is, twenty-one days after the attack. It is said that 42,000 people have been rendered homeless.Hamburg. A factory making fuses in the Brodermanns Weg in the suburbof Great Borstel has been severely damaged as a result of air attack.Occupied Territory.Hazebrouck.
