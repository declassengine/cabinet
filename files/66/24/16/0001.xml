(42) 186.April 30, 1942.WAR CABINET.SOVIET GOVERNMENTS ATTITUDE TOWARDS GREAT BRITAINAND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I THINK that my colleagues may like to see the annexed report by theDirector of Political Warfare on recent references to Great Britain and theUnited States of America in Soviet broadcasts. It is interesting to note thatthis more reasonable treatment began when the Soviet Government were informedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to negotiate a treaty with them.A. E.Foreign Office, April 30, 1942.Annex.Report by the Director of Political Warfare.1. During the last fortnight, references to both Britain and the UnitedStates on the Soviet home and foreign broadcasts have been more sympatheticthan during any previous period.2. On the Soviet home front the solidarity of the British and Soviet TradeUnions, the supplies from the two great British and American democracies, andthe alliance between the U.S.S.R. and these two democracies have been very muchstressed.3. In the Soviet broadcasts to Germany, British bombing was givenprominence, and German attempts to belittle the effect of these bombings waseffectively ridiculed.4. In the Soviet broadcasts to France, Britain and the United States werementioned as the two countries which, together with the U.S.S.R., have solemnlyundertaken to right the wrongs done by the Axis Powers. Commando and bombing raids were well &quot; played up.&quot; American supplies to the. U.S.S.R. werefeatured repeatedly.5. In the Soviet broadcasts to Italy, the growing might of British air power was emphasised, and Italians were reminded of the Battle of Britain and of theGerman fiasco.6. Within the last ten days Great Britain and the United States have been more frequently and more sympathetically mentioned in Soviet broadcasts to the balkans.April 30, 1942.Copy No.11705   [23775]
