THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1942.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 179.April 26, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK? AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.BOMBER COMMAND DIGEST FOR WEEK ENDING 1200 HOURS,SUNDAY, APRIL 26.1.Operations.Night-CologneRostock (town and a/c factory)Rostock ,, ,,RostockDay-Flushing (shipbuilding works)Dunkirk (docks)Cherbourg (docks)Havre (docks)  ...Abbeville (railway yard)22/2323/2424/2525/262425252525AprilApril691611481281266126aircraft.aircraft.2. Six Stirlings set out to attack the Skoda works at Pilsen on the night the25th/26th April, but, owing to cloud, only one found the target, which was bombed from a height of 1,500 feet. One of the objects of this raid was to stimulate subversive action.3. Minor night raids by &quot; Freshmen &quot; have been made on Havre (on two nights) and Dunkirk. The large number of successful photos taken by these crewsindicates a high standard of navigation and of determination to go right into aheavily defended target.4. 201 mines were laid during the week, chiefly off the Frisians and in theBelts and at the entrance to Kiel Fiord.Weather.5. The continent was covered by cloud for the first part of the week, whichaccounts for the smaller bombing effort compared with last week. Crews foundCologne almost completely cloud-covered, but Rostock was clear on each occasion.Opportunity was taken to lay mines on the nights which were unsuitable forbombing.Success Achieved.Cologne.- 6. The experimental &quot; blind &quot; raid on Cologne was particularly interestingbecause it was the first on which crews were ordered to release bombs with theassistance solely of the latest navigational device and to ignore such grounddetail as they might see. It was, in fact, a searching test of the instrument andof the crew&apos;s ability to work it efficiently under operational conditions.
Although no crew was able to identify Cologne owing to clouds and haze,no less than five of the six who took successful photos as they bombed were actually within 5 miles of the centre of the city.   It is reasonable to assume that this proportion represents the navigational accuracy of the crews who didI not succeed in..taking useful photos,, and the raid has therefore enormously. I increased the confidence of crews in this new device.:, Weather prevented photographic reconnaissance until yesterday, and the. examination of results is not yet complete.: Rostock.7.   There is no doubt that the three raids on Rostock and the Heinkel factoryhave achieved considerable and vital success.   Fires were still burning in many parts of the town on the afternoon of 25th April, the smoke from which obscures* . . much of the photographic cover.^ The. factory has also been severely damaged,&amp;LflG)- &apos; but to what extent cannot yet be gauged, as only half of it has been photographed.^eA^LiXdiA. Heavy attacks are again to be made on these two targets to-night, and afull report will be included in the next digest, when it is hoped to have obtainedcomplete photographic evidence.Information regarding previous Raids.Dortmund.8. Daylight photos of Dortmund taken since the raids of the 14th and15th April reveal that a fairly large engineering works known to be specialisingin bridge building and boiler manufacture has been extensively damaged by blastand fire; more than half of the roof coverage has been stripped.   (Photo attached.)A direct hit was made on a warehouse in the dock area and three workshopsare gutted by fire.       4Cologne.9. From information now available it is apparent that the attack on the night of the 13th/14th March was highly successful. Most of the Clouth rubberworks was burnt out; the Humbolt Deutz submarine diesel engine works was damaged; four buildings in the waggon works were completely destroyed and six vitally damaged; the boiler house in an important cable factory received adirect hit; the railway goods yards were damaged and a signal-box destroyed.It is most significant that the large industrial area within the triangle formed by the suburbs of Kalk, Deutz and Mulheim was closed to the public after the raid, and it is known that fires were still burning the following afternoon.Labour Corps personnel from Kassel and Frankfurt had to be brought in toassist in clearing the debris. More than 200 people were killed. The FiumboltDeutz works are the second largest builders of submarine diesel engines and theHagen submarine accumulator works are alongside.Essen.10. The German Press has admitted that a large number of H.E. and incendiary bombs have fallen on Essen, and urges the people to overhaul their .R.P. arrangements.Hazebrouck.11. Daylight photos taken following the daylight attack on Hazehrouckon 12th April show that three large buildings have been damaged; the railway station received a direct hit, the booking office and reception hall being completely destroyed.Dusseldorf.12. Photographic-reconnaissance has revealed considerable damage in a factory which produces machine tools, magnetic mines, shells and bombs. 180 feet of a long shop has been demolished.Poissy.13. An interesting photo of the Mat ford Works is attached. It clearlyshows &quot;the great holes in the roof of the main building and the charring by fire
r; 9made during the night raids of the 1st and 2nd April. Various other fire and blast incidents are apparent. We can confidently assume that the Matford works are wrecked.Augsburg.14. Although several attempts have been made the weather has preventedphoto reconnaissance of Augsburg, but it is noteworthy that the German broad-cast has admitted &quot; some damage to industrial areas and casualties among the civilian population.&quot; A dim photograph taken in twilight very low down duringthe raid shows a fierce fire, which was confirmed by a crew bombing later as being in the target (the M.A.N. submarine Diesel works).Renault.15. A further interesting incident has been reported about&apos;the Renaultraid illustrating the enormous blast effect of our bombs. A machine tool weighing42 tons was apparently displaced 30 yards and smashed.Ostend.16. A reliable source reports that, in the attack on the 15th/16th December,a cargo vessel of about 3,500 tons was hit and sank. The special evening tram,reserved exclusively for the Germans, received a direct hit.&quot; Scharnhorst,&quot; &quot; Gneisenau&quot; and &quot; Prinz Eugen.&quot;17. Several sources of varying reliability have reported on the damagesustained by the Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen while at Brest and since leaving that port. Each vessel was hit at Brest, Scharnhorst by threebombs, Gneisenau by three bombs and a torpedo,, and Prinz Eugen by two bombs.Apart from possible torpedo hits, it is certain that at least one of the vessels, andprobably both, was seriously damaged by air-laid mines during the passage through the North Sea. After Gneisenau arrived at Kiel, four sources have reported that she was hit by bombs on her fore part, one of these reports being-graded as high as B. 2. Two sources reported that she was submerged forward as a result of bomb hits, and there are other reports of serious fire damageensuing. Moreover, it is known that she has recently left Kiel, presumably forGdynia, and that she had to be towed!There have been four heavy raids on Kiel on which Gneisenau was theaiming point, and it is therefore reasonable to assume that reports of her havingbeen hit while in dock there are, in fact, correct.We have also learnt from a most reliable source in Germany that a captain of one of the aircraft which attacked the battleships in the North Sea is confident that he obtained two direct hits.   He was shot down after his attack.Sea-Mining Successes.18. It is known that the Swedish ferry-icebreaker Starke has been sunk by air-laid mines between Sassnitz and Trelleborg.  It had a goods train on board.19. In the second week in April a ship of about 6,000 tons was mined and sunk near Heligoland. She was stated to have been carrying troops, the majorityof whom were saved.(This information was obtained from a special source and should on no account be repeated.)
