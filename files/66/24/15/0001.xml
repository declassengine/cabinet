THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1942.^&quot;        &apos;     :---SECRET V copy NaW.P. (32) 185.May 2, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to (i!ensure the secrecy of this document. ; &apos;:WAR CABINET.THE VICHY SQUADRON AT  ALEXANDRIA.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.At the Meeting on the 30th March in my paper W.P. (42) 137 I raised thequestion of the renewal between Admiral Cunningham&apos;s successor and admiral godfroy of the Agreement made by Admiral Cunningham for the immobilisationof the French Squadron at Alexandria. It was decided to try to renew theAgreement temporarily until Admiral Plarwood reaches Alexandria, and then to negotiate a fresh agreement. Admiral Godf roy accepted this arrangement. Adecision is now required, as Admiral Harwood leaves for Alexandria on the5th or 6th of May.The alternatives to continuing the present Agreement are either to allow the Agreement to lapse, thus freeing not only our own but Admiral Godfroy&apos;shands, or else to seize the ships. The latter alternative is strongly opposed bythe Naval Staff for the reasons given in paragraphs 7 and 8 of W.P. (42) 137,and, this being so, to allow the Agreement to lapse would only free admiral godfroy&apos;s hands without giving us any material advantage. It is also evidentthat the return of Laval to Vichy has gravely increased the dangers of attempting to obtain possession of the ships, either by a negotiated agreement;or by force.Admiral Godfroy&apos;s attitude is that he is unable to continue the Agreementunless it is modified to permit reliefs being sent for the French personnel whohave done long service abroad. He points out that in the absence of any provi-sion for reliefs, his ships&apos; complements have, by the natural process of promotion,become top heavy, with the further result that the monthly allowance of  19,000is now insufficient for the maintenance of the Squadron. Early in March,;without reference to the renewal of the Agreement, he made an application forthe increase of his monthly allowance to  22,900, on the ground that his wages bill had swollen owing to our refusal to permit replacements. He stated that he1has been making up the deficiency out of the funds of the ships&apos; Savings Banks,but that these are becoming exhausted. No reply has yet been returned to hisapplication, but it is clear that Admiral Godf roy cannot continue on the present basis much longer. -Our main reason at first for objecting to replacements was that we hoped to use our financial control to compel Admiral Godfroy to reduce his ships&apos;complements.   This policy was successful until the position was reached that no more men could be sent back to France without reducing the complements below[23774]
even a care and maintenance basis. Our refusal to allow replacements was thenmaintained for three reasons :(a) The objection of the Free French that if reliefs are allowed there willbe no further volunteers to their movement.(b) The fear that Vichy might send anti-British agents as replacements.(c) The security objection to sending men back to France who have been inour main Mediterranean base for nearly two years.The above objections are not now important enough to warrant our holding out against a limited scheme of reliefs. The objection of the Free French has,from a practical point of view, little weight, because their success in recruitinghas always been very small indeed. The security objection loses much of its force by ireason of the fact that a large Cosmopolitan crowd is pretty free to come and go in Alexandria. The danger of anti-British agents being sent as replacementsis counterbalanced by the fact that men who are restless at their long detentionabroad may be potentially as dangerous material for agents as men fresh fromVichy.&apos; The Naval Staff have re-examined the question whether there are any modifications which it is desirable to make in our favour, but consider that thereare none that Admiral Godfroy can possibly concede, and that the existing agreement has worked satisfactorily.Admiral Cunningham, whom I have consulted upon his return, is strongly infavour of the present Agreement being continued, and, indeed, his views generallycoincide with those expressed in my paper W.P. (42) 137. He considers thatthere is no chance whatever of Admiral Godfroy surrendering the ships to us inreturn for repatriation of the crews. He agrees that there are no modificationsfor which we should press, and that a limited scale of relief should now be conceded to Admiral Godfroy. Admiral Harwood, the new Commander-in-Chief,whom I have also consulted, is of the same opinion.&apos; f therefore propose that Admiral Harwood should.be instructed to negotiatefor a renewal of the Agreement on the same terms as before, modified to permitAdmiral Godfroy to obtain reliefs on a scale of 150 to 200 per month, but subjectto t he following conditions : (a) That Admiral Godfroy himself remains in Alexandria as Commander-in-Chief.(b) He employs his right to obtain reliefs to reduce the pay bills of hisSquadron.&apos; ;! - (c) For security reasons, the route by which the men are sent back to France; and the times at which they are allowed to depart are at our discretion.(d) Admiral Godfroy undertakes to see that the reliefs sent out from Vichyare suitable and to send back to Vichy any that are found to engageri;.        in activities inimical to us.. (e) We have a right to insist on the return to Vichy of any individual whose&apos;-!-;.-! &apos;      activities at Alexandria we consider a menace to our security.Admiral Godfroy has, in fact, said that he is quite prepared to remain himself at alexandria as a guarantee that the reliefs are suitable and that his present policyis continued.Admiral Godfroy&apos;s conduct up to date has been scrupulously correct, but ifwe force him into an impossible position by holding out for conditions which he cannot accept, his attitude may alter. The recent changes at Vichy make it, inmy view, particularly important to maintain the present good relations with admiral Godfroy. The Naval Staff consider that our primary object should be tokeep the French Squadron quiet, and are of the opinion that our interests will be best served by the continuance. of the present Agreement, founded as it is uponthe undertakings of the French Admiral, whose good faith was tried and provedduring our Syrian Campaign.I attach as an Appendix a signal from Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,which throws some further light on the attitude of Admiral Godfroy.(Initialled) A. V. A.A dmiralty, May 2, 1942.
APPENDIX.Addressed Admiralty.(Important.   Aidac.)580.   Personal for Naval Secretary.   Please give to Admiral Cunningham&apos;on arrival.  During a farewell interview with Captain Dick the following points were made by Admiral Godfroy : 2. He significantly considered that in new agreement he could not possiblyaccept any terms more onerous than those at present obtained, and trusted thatthis would be realised, the more so as he hoped his attitude throughout hadconvinced us of his good faith and that his intentions were friendly to us.       ,3. He appealed to us to consider some scheme of relief on practical groundsbecause (a) Men kept here already for two years and who had to remain with noprospects of relief were far more likely to become hostile than anywho might be sent from France to replace them.(&amp;) The promotions were making the cost of pay ever increasing.(a) Impatience at a stage when he had to employ recently-made Petty officers on Able Seamen&apos;s or Stokers&apos; work, owing to lack of reliefs.(d) Appreciating that his presence might have some (? weight) (% he was)quite prepared to remain, however great the cost to himself, as a(? guarantee) that the reliefs were (? suitable) and that his present policy was continued.(e) He emphasised that if only agreement to relief (s) could be obtained &quot;inprinciple,&quot; the fact (? would have) most excellent (? effects) in theFrench Navy, as it would (? show) that the men (? here) were (? not)prisoners. He said he most earnestly urged it, apart from other considerations, as being decidedly to our ultimate advantage.(/) He pointed out that (? even) if Admiralty agreed he might well findGermans would not allow of change, as they would mistrust french navy, thinking they would send (? pro-)British crew and hand ships(? over) to us.4. The argument in paragraph 3 (a) (% has) certainly considerable weightand seems worth consideration, and paragraph 3 (d) is a useful and welcomesafeguard. The Admiral said he particularly wished to emphasise he had&quot; emptied his sack,&quot; i.e., put all his cards on the table, and was being absolutelyfrank, and there is no doubt this was so.
