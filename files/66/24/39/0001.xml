Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1942. 18-6SECRET. Copy. No.,W.P. (42) 209.May 15, 1942.WAR CABINET.ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION INTO PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.ON the 5th March, I raised with the War Cabinet the question of illegal immigration into Palestine. On that occasion, my colleagues re-affirmed earlierdecisions that all practicable steps should be taken to discourage illegal immigration into Palestine but that any illegal immigrants who, notwithstandingthese steps, reached Palestine should be treated with humanity. They shouldhe kept in internment camps unless and until arrangements could be made forthem to be shipped to some other destination. I w^as invited to bring the matter up again on the next occasion when a shipload of refugees from enemy-occupied territories reached Istanbul and we were asked whether wre would agree to let them into Palestine (W.M. (42) 29th Conclusions of 5th March).2. A situation has&quot; now arisen which makes it necessary for me to bring this difficult question once more before the War Cabinet. During the weeks whichhave elapsed since this decision the question of illegal immigration into Palestinehas remained a very live issue and there has been unremitting pressure, following the Struma disaster, by the Zionists in this country and the United States andby their sympathisers in Parliament for a declaration by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of their intentions not only as regards the treatment to be accorded to future shipments of -Jewish refugees arriving at Istanbul in the hope of reaching Palestine, but also as regards the fate of the passengers from theDarien, who have been in the detainment camp at Athlit for over a year. (Thechildren between the ages of 11 and 16 have just been released.) Moreover, thereare definite signs of some revival of the traffic. Within recent weeks, three other small vessels, the Mihai, the Euxine and the Mircea, with parties of nineteen,thirteen and thirty-four respectively, have reached Istanbul. In pursuance ofthe Cabinet&apos;s instructions, as soon as news was received of the arrival of the twoformer vessels at Istanbul, the Foreign Office telegraphed to His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Ankara, and instructed him to inform the Turkish Government thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government did not propose to ask them to take any steps to hinderthe onward passage of these vessels. The Euxine got away from Istanbul first and about the 20th April reached the neighbourhood of Smyrna, where, accordingto His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General, she is awaiting the arrival of a new master.As the Turks, on being questioned, professed to know nothing about the passengers, it may be presumed that they are still on board the ship and are notinterned. The Jewish Agency, however, are extremely anxious about them. TheMihai has made her way safely to Palestine : she reached Haifa on the 8th May,and her passengers have been transferred to the detainment camp at Athlit!The Mircea left Istanbul some time ago and is on her way to Palestine. Fromsecret sources the Palestine Government have recently learned that another largerboatload of illegals is scheduled to leave Constantsa shortly and that somethousands of Jews are reported to be concentrated at Constantsa seekino- a meansof escape from Roumania. A situation has now, in fact, arisen wdien the problemmust be frankly faced.3.   The possibility of diverting shiploads of intending illegal immio-rantsfrom the Palestine coast and finding homes for them in some other country has[23826]
2 -again been most thoroughly explored. But for various reasons it has proved tobe impracticable to accommodate such people in Cyprus, Syria, Egypt, Eritrea,East Africa or Mauritius. Nor is the shipping to take them to distant destina-tions available. I have therefore been forced to the conclusion not only that itwill not be practicable to deport the Darien passengers, but also that future con-signments of refugees who fetch up on the Palestine coast will have to be allowedto remain in the country. An enquiry has been made of His Majesty&apos;s Legationin Addis Ababa whether it would not be feasible to settle some of the illegal immigrants among the Falasha Jewish settlements in Abyssinia, but, even if theattitude of the Emperor is favourable to this, it may be impracticable to divertmore than an almost negligible number.4. There can, of course, be no question of facilitating illegal immigration.That is my view, and Sir H. MacMichael, whom I consulted during his recent visit to this country, is in full agreement with it. Anything which might beregarded by Arab opinion as disturbing the balance of the White Paper policy at the present juncture would be most dangerous. But a distinction can, I feel and he agrees be drawn between those who, having escaped from enemy-occupied countries, seek our assistance en route and Jewish refugees who eventually succeedby their own efforts in reaching Palestinian soil. It is with regard to these lastthat I submit certain proposals to my colleagues. They have the approval bothof the High Commissioner and of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.5. The procedure which I suggest should be adopted is as follows : On their arrival all illegals will be detained; they will then be passed through a check for security to the satisfaction of both civil and military security authorities, it being understood that the onus proof of bona fides rests as far as possible withthe individual detainees If they pass this check they will, subject to theapplication of the overriding principle of economic absorptive capacity, be released from detention; they will then be set off against the current half-yearlyquotas granted under the White Paper. Each individual case will be treated onits merits and releases will be made individually. The same procedure wouldhave to be adopted in the case of the Darien detainees; they would be liberatedgradually and after completion of the security investigation. While appreciatingthat no security check could be wholly effective, the High Commissioner considersthat there is no practical alternative to the proposed procedure for dealing withthis most difficult problem. The War Office have consulted the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, urgently by telegraph, and he has concurred in the arrange-ments. While this new procedure can be defended against the charge that itcontravenes the Immigration clauses of the White Paper, it must be recognisedthat it involves a clear departure from the announcement made on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in November 1940 at a time when the shipping situationin the Mediterranean was very different, that all future immigrants reachingPalestine would be deported.6.   To sum up, I now ask for approval of the following proposals :  (1) That, in pursuance of the existing policy of taking all practicable stepsto discourage illegal immigration in Palestine, no steps whatever should be takento facilitate the arrival of Jewish &quot; refugees &quot; in Palestine.This will mean, in practice, that no facilities should be granted to jewish refugees who may become stranded in Turkey in attempting to enter Palestineillegally from enemy-occupied territories, even though the deportation of such persons from Turkey back to those territories as a result of our refusal to inter-vene may be represented by the Jewish Agency as likely to create future incidentscomparable to the Struma disaster.(2) That future shiploads of illegals who, nevertheless, succeed in reachingPalestine should be landed, placed in detainment camps, and those who pass thesecurity and economic absorptive checks should gradually be released against thecurrent half-yearly quotas granted under the White Paper.(3) That the Darien detainees should be subjected, to the same procedure.(4) That no undue publicity should be given to the new arrangements,although, in reply to Parliamentary Questions and enquiries from the jewish agency, it will be necessary to give a general outline of the arrangements.Colonial Office, May 15, 1942,
