(42) 205 (Revise).May 14, 1942.WAR CABINET.FUNCTIONS OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE on reconstruction PROBLEMS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT has become necessary in the conduct of political relations with our Allies,particularly the United States and the Soviet Union, to clear our own minds on certain broad questions on which our general policy after the war will have tobe based.2. No serious progress can be made, however, without an authoritativeestimate of what is possible, as distinct from desirable, in the military sphere.There are certain fundamental questions to which only the military authoritiescan give the answers. Should not we be prepared as the Germans were with theincomparably efficient armistice terms that they imposed upon the French ? Whatcontinuing measures of control can be exercised so as to ensure that there shall beno clandestine rearmament ? What further measures of reinsurance are therethat could be taken?3. In present circumstances the Service Advisers on whom responsibilityfor such advice must rest are fully occupied with the immediate conduct of thewar. Nevertheless, some thought is being given to these problems in the service departments and elsewhere^ but so far without any central direction force  -ordination with non-strategic post-war planning.4. In the circumstances, I suggested to the Paymaster-General that he should consider setting up a military section in his office whose function it would be, notto define future military policy, but to collect such facts as are known, to act asliaison between the various departments concerned with these problems and toassist and direct research on the most profitable lines. Sir W. Jowitt, however,pointed out that he could not undertake such a task without the express authorityof the War Cabinet. His position was merely that of Chairman of a ministerial committee. Its terms of reference might be broadly drawn. On the other hand,no Service Minister sat on it nor had the Paymaster-General any express authorityto direct research in the fields in which Service Ministers were primarily responsible for policy. In his opinion, the first thing to do was to put the point to the War Cabinet and enquire whether they desired him and his organisation to include work of this sort in their functions.5. There is no question of adding to the existing burdens of those engagedin the conduct of the war. What I have in mind would relieve them of muchwork which is extraneous to that task. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will agree that the necessary measure of authority should be conferred on the paymaster-General to enable him, in concert with the Service Ministers andthe Chiefs of Staff, to make such arrangements as they see fit to ensurethat the mass of factual information which already exists should be properlysifted and presented in such a form as to assist those responsible for decidingpolicy, Ministers and Service Chiefs alike, when the time for so doing arrives.A.
