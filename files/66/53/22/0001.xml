(44) 422.31st July, 1944. \jfWAR CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND for four WEEKS ENDING 16th JULY, 1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.A. A detailed summary of operations is appended.B. Results of Operations.1. Large sites and flying bomb sites in France.A large number of attacks were made during the period on supposed rocketsites, flying bomb storage depots, supply sites, and launching sites in France.The two attacks on the depot at St. Leu d&apos;Esserent, which is believed to be themain supply depot in France and to contain as many as 1,000 flying bombs, were particularly successful (see Prints Nos. 1 and 2). A good attack was,made on thelars;e site at Watten which, as Print No. 3 shows, had alreadv been damas d by a previous attack. Prints Nos. 4 and 5 show important damage to the large site atSiracourt caused by daylight attacks on the 25th June and the 6th July. other large sites successfully attacked include Wizernes (see Print No. 6) andMimoyecques.  Print No. 7 shows the launching site for flying bombs at L&apos;Hey.2. Railway Centres.Many railway centres were attacked with good results. Print No. 8 shows the very severe damage at Dijon after the night attack of the 5th/6th July. the marshalling yard at Orleans, which had already suffered in earlier attacks, was almost completely devastated on the 4th/5th July (see Print No. 9). In the rail-way yard of Metz the tracks leading from the west of the railway stores depot tothe eastern storage buildings and also to the Strasbourg line were cut (print. 10), and some 65 hits were scored on the tracks alone at Blainville (see print. 11). Among other railway centres damaged were Vaires (in two successful attacks on the 27th/28th June and the 7th/8th Jury), Vierzon, where thelocomotive depot was seriously damaged, and Tours, where every track was blockedand a road bridge was hit and collapsed on the lines below.3. Troop concentrations and. other military targets in France.Enemy forces and armour assembling at Villers Bocage were heavily andsuccessfully attacked on the 30th June. All roads were blocked and the Divisionaland Regimental Staff Headquarters were partially put out of action. Two aimingpoints in the enemy&apos;s positions to the West of Caen were selected for heavy attacks by Bomber Command before the large-scale attack by the 2nd Army on the8th July. Photographs show a niass of craters round the aiming points and theresults were considered to have been highly successful. Print No. 12 shows damageat the Longues Coastal battery inflicted on the eve of D-day.4. Targets in Germany. **Mosquito attacks were made on Berlin, Hanover and Saarbrucken and onsynthetic oil plants at Homberg, Meerbeck and Buer Scholven.C. Sea Mining.Mine-laying during the period was planned to interfere with the movements of enemy U-boats operating in the Western part of the English Channel.   The[27921]
approaches to the U-boat bases at Brest, Lorient and St. Nazaire were continuallymined and the approaches to the advanced U-boat bases at St. Malo, St. PeterPort, Guernsey, and St. Anne, Alderney, were mined at regular intervals. Thereis every indication that the mines laid off Guernsey have denied the use of st. Peter Port to the enemy U-boats. The Ministry of Economic Warfare estimate that up to the end of May the mining offensive in the Baltic and the Kiel Canalhad cost the enemy 3 million tons of cargo-carrying capacity and a loss of nearly1-4 million tons of imports.A.
