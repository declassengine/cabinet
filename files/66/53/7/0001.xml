THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 407.24th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.STAFFING OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE IN THE immediate post-WAR PERIOD.Memorandum by tee Secretary oe State for Foreign Affairs.I feel that I should inform my colleagues of certain action which I proposeto take in regard to recruitment for the Foreign Service. -In his paper W.P. (44) 86 the Chancellor of the Exchequer submitted to theWar Cabinet the draft of an announcement on post-war recruitment to the CivilService which he subsequently made in Parliament on the 17th February last. at my request the Chancellor added to his announcement a sentence to the effect thatI would shortly make a statement about recruitment to the Foreign Service.As my colleagues will understand, the Foreign Service will be in very urgent need of men after the war and I have been anxious to issue, at an early date,regulations for the reconstruction examinations which are to be held as soon aspossible after the armistice in Europe in order that intending candidates may apply and be summoned to sit as soon as the military situation permits. TheMinister of Labour and National Service takes the view that it is undesirable atthis stage to issue the actual regulations of the examinations as any such publicitywould be inconsistent with the Governments decision to refrain from discussion about plans for the release of men from the Forces and because the publicationof detailed arrangements for one Service would lead to a demand for similar state-ments about other Services. I recognise the force of these arguments and haveagreed not to press for the immediate issue of the detailed regulations for thepost-war examinations. At the same time, I am most anxious to give some indica-tion of the possibilities of post-war recruitment to the Foreign Service similar tothose given by the Chancellor in regard to the Home Civil Service and, indeed, i feel that I am pledged to do so.I accordingly annex a. draft of the statement which I propose to make shortly.It is in very general terms, to which the Minister of Labour and National Servicesees no objection, and with which the Prime Minister is content. If any of mycolleagues have observations which they wish to make, I should be glad&apos; if theywould let me know.A. E.Foreign Office, 24th July, 1944.ANNEX.Statement on Post-War Recruitment to the Foreign Service.In his statement on the 17th February, my right honourable friend, theChancellor of the Exchequer laid down the principles of Government policy inregard to post-war recruitment for the civil Service. Those principles applyalso in the case of the Foreign Service&apos;.The White Paper which I presented to Parliament in January of last yearset out the lines which recruitment and training for the Foreign Service will follow when times become normal. The White Paper also explained that, on12440   [27879]
the cessation of hostilities, the urgent need of the Foreign Service for new staff would involve special arrangements for recruitment. As stated in the white paper, it will be necessary not merely to make good the wastage of the war years,but also to provide staff to meet the numerous and heavy tasks that will fall upon the Service at the end of the war.The first need for recruits will be for the senior branch of the Service, thatis to say, for the branch which at present consists of established members of theformer Diplomatic, Commercial Diplomatic, and Consular Services. The future organisation of the other branches, some of whose members at present form partof the Civil - Service, and the question of recruitment to them, are still underconsideration.For the senior branch, it is intended, as soon as possible after hostilities withGermany cease and in the measure that the continued requirements of the general military situation permit, to enable candidates, and particularly men now serving in the Forces, to offer themselves as competitors at a simplified &quot; reconstruction &quot;examination such as it should be possible for them to take without special study.Particulars of these examinations, of which it is intended to hold a series at intervals during the two or three years after hostilities in Europe, will be announced in due course by the Civil Service Commissioners, to whom intendingcandidates will then be invited to apply.
