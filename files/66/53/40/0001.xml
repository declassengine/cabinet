(44) 440.11th Augxist, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER IN 1944.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their meeting on the 12th July, 1944, the War Cabinet approved theprovisional man-power allocations for the second half of 1944, proposed in w.P. (44) 375, on the understanding that these allocations would be reviewedtowards the end of August (W.M. (44) 90th Conclusions).2. For the purpose of reviewing the provisional allocations for the second half of 1944 and of enabling Departments to plan for the first half of 1945, it isnecessary that the Service and Supply Departments should now be given a newhypothesis.When they decided that the position should be reviewed again in August,the War Cabinet had it in mind that it might be possible by then to makeassumptions about the future course of the war which could not be made with confidence early in July.I suggest, for the consideration of my colleagues, that in present circum-stances it would be reasonable to ask the Departments to prepare and submit tothe War Cabinet revised estimates of their requirements for the second half of1944, on the assumption that the war with Germany, though it may be prolongedbeyond the end of 1944, will not continue beyond the 30th June, 1945.3. If the War Cabinet accepted this assumption, Departments would havea firm, basis on which they could formulate their estimates of man-power requirements for the remaining months of 1944. I suggest, therefore, that theService Ministers and the Minister of Production should now be invited to submitestimates of man-power requirements for the Services and the munitions industries on this hypothesis, in time for the War Cabinet to review the position before theend of August and to fix firm allocations of man-power for the second half ofthis year.4. When this has been done, the Departments should proceed to examinethe implications of these decisions, and of the assumption on which they are based, for their programmes in the first half of 1945. The results of thatexamination should be available ^for the War Cabinet when, in October orNovember, they come to make the next annual review of man-power in the lightof the survey by the Minister of Labour and National Service.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,11th August, 1944.[27988]
