R. A.Privy Council Office, S. W. 1,2nd August, 1944. &apos;Copy No.DEPARTMENT   OF   SCIENTIFIC   AND   INDUSTRIAL   RESEARCH.A Brief Account of some of the Studies carried out at theRoad Research Laboratory related to the Invasion.1. In peace time the Road Research Laboratory was engaged on a programme of research on road making, including the study of materials and methods of construction. The knowledge gained in this work has been ofconsiderable use in the war in dealing with problems of the building of militaryroads and aerodromes. But the Laboratory has also turned its attention to problems of offensive warfare arising in the use of explosives in attack onfortifications and for special purposes. The application of scientific method tothese studies, and in particular the development of scale model trials, has enabled the Laboratory to give advice of the greatest value to the Service authorities whohave planned the attacks. The Laboratory is frequently consulted on suchmatters now, and it is often able to answer rapidly technical problems put to itas a result of the experience which it has accumulated.2. One of the outstanding examples of -work on a special project was the study made by the Laboratory on the method of destroying a masonry dam. Bymeans of tests on small models and then a trial on a small dam in North Wales,it was possible to find just where it would be necessary to place the smallestamount of explosive needed to destroy a dam of a particular type. A specialtype of missile was devised by an industrial firm, and the project was brought tosuccess by the Royal Air Force, in its attack on the Mohne dam in May 1943.3. Similar studies have been made to find out what types of railwayviaducts could be demolished by the same type of missile. Underwater attack of the piers of bridges across the Rhine and the Seine have been studied, and methods of destroying canal embankments were examined by model tests. Thethree photographs (Annexes 1 and 2) show the general arrangement of the modelof a pair of viaduct piers. The photographs (Annexe 3) show the effect of trialson breaching canal embankments on a canal in Shropshire.Special experiments were made to discover whether piers could be more easily demolished by underwater attack if the comparatively firm backing afforded by the water were to be removed at a critical moment by the explosion of a smallcharge against the face of the pier away from that at which the main charge isset. It was found that in certain circumstances the creation of a bubble of gasfrom such a subsidiary explosion, properly timed, would.lead to the destruction ofa pier with a saving of 70 per cent, of the main charge. In the conditions inwhich such destruction might be carried out, this might well be of considerable importance.4.   Specially-shaped charges for attack on reinforced concrete bridges havebeen devised and tested. These charges are made with a tunnel-shaped cavity in the[27862]
form of an inverted V. They are effective in cutting through the steel reinforce-ments of concrete and so weakening the structure that it collapses under its load.Annexes 4, 5 and 6 show the arrangements for a model test of this method of destruction.5. Model tests have been made to find the amount of explosive requiredto breach anti-tank walls of standard construction. The photographs(Annexe 7) show the effect, on a scale of about one inch to the foot, ofa 1,000-lbs. charge placed against a 6-ft. heavy construction wall of reinforcedconcrete. The object of such a demolition is to effect a breach through whicha tank can pass. This can be checked, roughly, with a model tank, as shown inthe photograph, but verification is, of course, required on the full scale. [Thisfull-scale verification has been carried out for the Anti-Concrete Committee ofthe Ministry of Supply (of which Dr. Glanville, the Director of Road Research,is Chairman) and a photograph of this full-scale verification is shown  in similar trials have beenscale in mock assaults byAnnexe 8. This corresponds closely with the model,made on sea walls which have been verified on a fidtroops. An important part of all these tests has been the determination of thedistances away from the explosives at which men are safe from the effects ofblast.6. Methods of attacking pill-boxes have been studied at the Laboratory,first on the model scale and then on a full-scale replica of a German pill-box.The first attempts on model scale showed that charges placed in contact withthe wall of the pill-box would have to be so large as to be impracticable, butspecially shaped charges as shown in the diagram (Annexe 9) producedeffective results for comparatively small quantities of explosive. Not onlywas the effect of the charge in demolishing the pill-box examined but iestswere made also on a dummy man (photograph Annexe 10) in the full-scale replica,to discover what effect the&quot;explosion would have on the occupants. Experimentswere also made to discover the time required for an armour-piercing shell toperforate the concrete wall of a pill-box so that the fusing of the shell mightbe adjusted to ensure it exploding inside the pill-box immediately it penetratedthe wall. The photograph (Annexe 11) shows the inside of the concrete wall asthe shot emerges. In the final photograph marked (d) the shot can be seenappearing from the debris which it has released from the Avail. Experimentaland theoretical studies have been made to determine the type of explosive shellwhich will not only remove the concrete from a reinforced concrete wall but which will also destroy the reinforcing rods by cutting them when the shell casedisintegrates into splinters. It is only when concrete and reinforcement aredestroyed that the wall is effectively breached.7. The Road Research Laboratory has devoted a good deal of attentionduring the war to the design of armour plating made from plastic materialcontaining small stones and backed by mild steel. This material, which was first produced at the Road Research Laboratory in 1940 and was named&quot; plastic armour,&quot; has since been modified as the result of research and is nowcalled &quot; plastic protective plating.&quot; For the protection it affords against bomband shell splinters and shaped charges it is lighter than steel armour plate. Ithas been extensively adopted for use both on land and at sea and is manufactured in America, India, South Africa and many other places besides this country. its performance as protection against projectiles of all kinds has been examined indetail and it has been proved to be satisfactory for widely varying protective purposes. The photographs (Annexe 12) show the effect of a thin slab ofplastic armour placed in front of a 1-inch mild-steel plate in experiments in which a small projectile weighing 1^ ozs. was fired at a very high velocity atthe armour. It is clear from the right-hand photograph showing the back viewof the armour that the plastic armour facing has fiad a very considerable effect in preventing the penetration by the projectile.8. The other aspect of the Laboratory&apos;s work which is of special interestfrom the point of view of military operations is that of the study of soils of allkinds upon which roads and aerodromes will be built. Investigations have beenmade to find ways of stabilising beaches over which lorries and tanks will be driven. Methods of covering beaches with fabric and metal tracks have been studied on a full scale and ways of overcoming special difficulties, such as theprevention of waterlogging of the ground under hessian runways and the pre-vention of excessive dust arising from prepared airstrips, have been examined andsatisfactorily solved. Hessian impregnated with bituminous mixtures has beentested for its suitability for aircraft landing strips at the temperatures whichwill be encountered in hot climates. Difficulties which might arise from the pre-impregnated surface sticking to the tyres have been successfully overcome.
