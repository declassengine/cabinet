THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  Jxdy 1944.CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.W.P. (44) 420.31s* July, 1944.WAR CABINET.ADMINISTRATION OF FORESTRY POLICY.Report by the Chairman of the Machinery of Government Committee.Introduction.1. The Committee on the Machinery of Government have recentlyconsidered,* in consultation with the Lord President of the Council, the Ministryof Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Ministryof Town and Country Planning and the Minister without Portfolio, the questionof the future arrangements for the administration of forestry policy, which is raised in a Report on Post-War Forestry Policy! submitted to my predecessorby the Forestry Commission.Existing position.2. The Forestry Commission was established under the Forestry Act, 1919.It took over the functions then exercised in respect of forestry by the agricultural departments, and was equipped with further powers. The number of theCommissioners, who are appointed by The King on the recommendation of thePrime Minister, may not exceed ten, of whom one must be a member of the Houseof Commons; two must have a special knowledge of Scottish forestry; and one must be a person having scientific attainments and technical knowledge of forestry.In practice, the main political parties are normally represented on the commission by Members of the House of Commons. Three of the Commissioners may be paidsalaries but not the Commissioner who is by statute required to be a Member ofParliament. The Parliamentary Commissioner answers routine questions in theHouse of Commons, but is not a Minister of the Crown. Questions of major policy are answered by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor of the Exchequer.3. The Commission is charged with the general duty of promoting theinterests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the production and supply of timber in the United Kingdom.   It carries out these functions both(i) by the creation and maintenance of State forests, for which purpose it has power to purchase land compulsorily, although it has not in fact exercised it, and(ii) by the encouragement of private forestry by such measures as grants forplanting. Ancillary to its main functions are the encouragement of forestryeducation, the building up of a forestry service and the promotion of research.4. The Commission reserves to itself the direction of policy, finance,research, education and publications, but its executive work is devolved understatutory authority, in England and Wales and in Scotland respectively, upon twoAssistant Commissioners.5. The Commission is bound to consult the agricultural Departments beforeacquiring or disposing of land; but otherwise the Government^ present controlover the Commission is a financial control and is vested in the Treasury. this control is potentially a close one, in that almost all the powers vested in theCommissioners by statute are subject to directions which may be given by theTreasury.   In practice,, however, control has been mainly confined to the total* M.G. (44) 4th and 15th Meetings. f Cmd. 6447.[27918]
sums to be allocated from year to year to the Commission for forestry purposes,to the programme of land acquisition and the prices to be paid for land, and tothe numbers and remuneration of the Commission^ staff.Grounds for making a change.6. It is true that hitherto the work of the Forestry Commission has not given rise to serious political controversy, but it is likely that Parliament win press for more direct ministerial responsibility for, and control over, the policy ofthe Forestry Commission, in view of the probable expansion of the Commission^operations after the war.7. Apart from probable parliamentary opinion, the Commission wouldprobably find that if a considerable extension of their activities is approved-forinstance in connection with the dedication of private woodlands, or the acquisitionof further large areas for planting for which alternative users are urged by other interests the execution of the programme would be a slow and arduous task forthem unless they are provided with direct ministerial support and representationboth within the Government and before parliamentary and public opinion.8. Finally, there has recently been a movement in Parliament and theScottish Press for the establishment of a separate Forestry authority in Scotland.Vieivs of the Machinery of, govern^ent Committee.9. The Machinery&quot;&quot;^ Government Committee strongly recommend theretention of a single Forestry authority responsible for Forestry in England andWales and in Scotland. The Forestry Commission itself pleads earnestly againsta change in this respect, pointing out that both the Acland Committee anda Cabinet sub-committee which considered the point before the institution of the forestry Commission recommended a single authority. The case based on thenecessity for a unified Forestry policy covering all three countries, for unifiedresearch; education and information services, and for a single Forestry service appears to be overwhelming, and both the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland support it. It may be noted here thatthe Forestry Commission in its Report has suggested the appointment forexecutive purposes of a Commissioner (instead of an Assistant Commissioneras at present) for Scotland. Some such step, it is to be hoped, would help to reconcile those sections of Scottish opinion which have pressed for a separate scottish Forestry Commission. Further devolution will probably be desirable in wales also.10. Much of the work of the forestry authority must always be highlytechnical, and in the view of the Machinery of Government Committee it cannotbe assigned to an ordinary Government Department but must continue to beentrusted to a Forestry Commission containing persons with the proper technical knowledge as well as others with more general qualifications.11. The Machinery of Government Committee have very carefully considered a number of alternative suggestions for securing more direct ministerial responsibility. They would see no advantages in the creation of a new Ministerof Forests : such an appointment would only add unnecessarily to the totalnumber of Ministers of the Crown. They have addressed themselves mainly to thearguments for and against assigning the responsibility to the agricultural ministers.12. In their considered view, the arguments against such an arrangementare based largely on a misconception, viz., that it must necessarily result in thesubordination of forestry to agricultural considerations. It appears to theCommittee, on the contrary, that it could be so operated as to be greatly to theadvantage of forestry. Once the broad lines of forestry policy had been laid downby the Cabinet, the responsibility for its efficient execution would rest squarelyon the Agricultural Ministers. Whereas, under the present arrangements, it isnatural for those Ministers to throw their weight on the side of agriculture, itwould, under the new arrangements, be contrary to their statutory duty. Theywould be, in fact even if not in name, as much Ministers of Forests as Ministers ofAgriculture. An extensive forestry programme would throw up many problemsinvolving agricultural considerations, and there is much to be said for unifiedplanning and control by an authority responsible for both forestry and agricul-ture, for instance, in the surveying of rural areas, the selection of forestry sites,
the approval of schemes for the gradual afforestation of agricultural land ear-marked for the purpose, the efficient management for agricultural purposes ofsuch land until it is taken over for forestry purposes, &amp;c. A merely negativepower of veto by the Agricultural Ministers over the operations of the forestry commission would not be sufficient. Their positive initiative, support and direction are required.13. The Committee therefore recommend in favour of assigning ministerial responsibility for forestry to the two Agricultural Ministers jointly, on thegeneral ground that it would be an advantage, both to forestry and to agriculture,,if the well-being of these two industries, similar in their character but sometimesconflicting in their claims, were to be jointly considered by the same authority,who would have a clear-cut responsibility for ensuring a properly balanced policyand the necessary power to enforce it. Moreover, direct participation by theSecretary of State for Scotland in control of forestry policy might be expected tobe welcome to Scottish opinion. There are precedents for joint responsibility by two Ministers for the work of a Board or Commission, and no insuperable difficultyneed be apprehended on that score. It is true that the arrangements before 1919,wrhen the Agricultural Departments were responsible for such forestry policy asthen existed, were unfavourably criticised; but the Committee are satisfied thatthe conditions to-day are so changed that pre-1919 experience is irrelevant.14. Though under the new arrangements there would be the closest co-opera-tion between the staffs of the Agricultural Departments and of the forestry commission, it would be important, in order to make clear that forestry wouldnot be subordinated to agriculture, that the Forestry Commission should beanswerable direct to the Agricultural Ministers without any intermediaryand should be given a clear-cut status as the organisation through which the approved forestry policy of the Government would be carried out. In theirday-to-day technical functions, though the ultimate power and responsibility would rest with the Ministers, the Commission would no doubt in practice carryon with little or no ministerial intervention. It would have to be made clear in any announcement that the changes did not imply any diminution, but rather the contrary, in the importance attached by the Government to the efficientplanning and execution of a forestry programme.15. It would be a necessary corollary of the proposed change or, indeed,of any scheme for providing direct ministerial responsibility that theCommission should no longer be answered for in Parliament by a back-benchmember, and that Members of the House of Commons should no longer sit onthe Commission. It would be extremely embarrassing that an executive organof Government, under the direct control of Ministers, should contain Members ofthe House of Commons, even if they were drawn from all parties.16. The Committee gave attention to a number of other points with whichthe War Cabinet need not be troubled since it is clear that satisfactory arrange-ments can be made; for instance, consultation with the Ministry of Town and country Planning, where appropriate, in England and Wales, arrangements between the two agricultural Ministers for answering questions and debates in Parliament, accounting arrangements and representation before the public accounts Committee, &amp;c.17. The Forestry Commission themselves did not recommend any changein the present position and were in favour of keeping control of forestry separate from control of agriculture. Informal consultation with the Chairman, however,indicates that if the War Cabinet decided in principle in favour of the changeabove recommended there would be no insuperable difficulties in working out thenecessary consequential changes and the co-operation of the Chairman and hiscolleagues could be relied on.18. Legislation would be required to alter the constitution of theCommission (paragraph 15 above) and also to invest the Agricultural ministers with the necessary powers : the present statutory powers of the Treasury inestablishment and financial as distinct from policy -matters would, of course,remain. Further discussion of details between the Departments concerned willbe necessary after a decision of principle has been taken: and it&apos; would be.convenient if new legislation could be passed before the 29th November next,when the term of office of the present Commission expires.
Summary of recommendations.19. The Machinery of Government Committee therefore recommend that theWar Cabinet should (i) record the following general decisions : (a) that there should continue to be a single Forestry Commissioncovering England and Wales, and Scotland, on the under-standing that there would be appropriate devolution of respon-sibility in different parts of Great Britain.(b) that ministerial responsibility for, and control over, the work ofthe Forestry Commission should be assigned to the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State forScotland, acting jointly; the present statutory powers of theTreasury being reduced to the normal powers of control inestablishment and financial matters.(c) that the statutory provision whereby one of the members of the forestry Commission must be a member of the House ofCommons should be repealed and that members of the House ofCommons should be disqualified from being members of theCommission.(ii) authorise the Ministers concerned to arrange for detailed discussion, inconsultation with the Forestry Commission, of the legislative andadministrative changes required to implement these decisions, with aview to the introduction of legislation as soon as possible after the recess.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,31st July, 1944.J.
