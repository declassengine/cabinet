JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTREPORT OF COMMITTEE ON POLICY IN ETHIOPIA.THE War Cabinet, at their Meeting on the 28th June, 1944 (W.M. (44)83rd Conclusions, Minute 2), appointed a Committee comprising The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for War,The Minister of State,to consider and report to the War Cabinet on the questions of policy in relation^to Ethiopia set out in W.P. (44) 333 and W.P. (44) 334.2. The first paper described the circumstances leading to the reconsideration of policy towards Ethiopia which had taken place at the end of 1943, and theEmperor&apos;s rejection of the proposal that a Mission should visit Ethiopia as a preliminary to the renewal or amendment of the Agreement and MilitaryConvention of January 1942. The Emperor had thereafter himself put forward proposals for a fresh Agreement, the general effect of which was the removal ofall restrictions on full Ethiopian autonomy. The Emperor wished to abolish the precedence of His Majesty&apos;s Minister and all restriction upon his ownfreedom of action in the matter of the appointment of advisers. He also askedfor the return of the areas placed by the agreement under British administration and of the Ogaden, and the appointment of an expert to recommend what further financial assistance should be afforded to Ethiopia. Meanwhile, he had beenseeking United States assistance in the rehabilitation of his country. He had now given notice of termination of the Agreement of 1942. There seemed to be three possible policies, namely : (i) To allow the Agreement to terminate and thus divest ourselves ofresponsibility for the administration,(ii) To assume a measure of responsibility for the good government of ethiopia (involving the payment of a subsidy, intervention with theEmperor&apos;s Government, &amp;c).(iii) To adopt a policy of collaboration with the United States of america to provide Ethiopia on a joint basis with financial, technical andmaterial assistance.3. The second paper set out in detail the frontier adjustments included among certain requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government described in the firstpaper, and gave reasons for thinking that the cessions of territory required couldnot be secured without territorial or other compensation. While the precisenature of the quid pro quo could not be determined in advance of the peacenegotiations, the possibility of the cession of the southern parts of Eritrea wassuggested. It was also noted that the plans for Greater Somalia, should theymature, would involve the transfer of the Qgaden territory from Ethiopia.4. We have given full consideration to the views of the interested Depart-ments on this matter, and we have had the advantage of a statement of the viewsof the Commander-in-Chief, East Africa.   We note that (a) the present Agreement expires on the 25th August next, when variousimportant British rights will lapse;(6) while the Emperor&apos;s part in carrying out the Agreement of January 1942might be criticised, it is to our interest to have a friendly under-standing with him, and the adoption of too stiff a line with theEmperor might give rise to misunderstanding in Parliament; andPrinted for the War Cabinet.

(c) in spite of his former refusal to accept a Mission, the Emperor now appears to be genuinely anxious to come to an amicable under-standing, and it is thought that, provided he feels that his sovereignrights are safeguarded, he is likely to concede our requirements.5. We therefore recommend on a review of the position as a whole that negotiations should be reopened with the Emperor, with the object of securing an interim agreement to tide over the period before a fresh Treaty can be negotiated.6. We have considered the main points on which decisions will be necessary if this course is to be pursued.   These are : (i) The method of approach to the Emperor,(ii) The instructions to be given to our representatives,(iii) The extent to which in any such fresh approach we should co-operate with the United States Government.I. The Method of Approach to the Emperor.7.   We considered three possible courses of action : (a) The opening of conversations with the Emperor by His Majesty&apos;minister on his return to Addis Ababa.(b) An invitation to the  Emperor to send  a representative here  forpreliminary negotiations.(c) The despatch of a special representative to Addis Ababa.A condition to be attached to the adoption of any of these courses would bea suspension of the notice to terminate the Agreement of January 1942 pendingthe conclusion of an understanding with the Emperor.8. We reject the first course on the grounds that in the Emperor&apos;s presentmood it would be advisable to adopt some approach of a special character.9. There has been some indication that the Emperor had himself wishedto come to London and might wrell appreciate an invitation at any rate to send a representative. We doubt, however, whether the Emperor could easily finda representative who would be suitable, and we feel that the second course, thoughit would probably be welcome to the Emperor, could not be expected to. produce a final result.10. The third course has good precedent and would in our judgment providethe ceremonious approach which seems to be important, and which would be consistent with taking the very firm line in negotiation which we regard asjustified on all points with which we are concerned.11. After full consideration, we recommend that the Emperor should beinformed that His Majesty&quot;s Government are ready to enter into discussions with a view to settling a new Agreement. They assume that the notice of termination of the existing Agreement will be suspended pending the outcome of these discussions. They would be very willing in the first place to receive arepresentative of the Emperor here, should he so desire, but feel the negotiation of an instrument so important as that in view can best be carried out in Ethiopia,and trust that His Imperial Majesty will agree. They would in that event beglad to send a special representative to Addis Ababa to conduct the negotiations.12. We also recommend that it should be made clear to the Emperor thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government assume that our representative will be given allfacilities necessary to inform himself fully on subjects to be covered by theAgreement on which our present information is inadequate. We must so frameour approach as to avoid suggesting to the Emperor that we had in view aninquisition, and negotiations, if they could be started on the basis proposed,should be ad referendum.II. The Instructions to be given to the Special Representative.13. We have compared the Agreement and Military Convention of 1942 withthe Emperor&apos;s draft proposals, and we have considered, in the light of thiscomparison, what stipulations should be made by our special representative inregard to His Majesty&apos;s Governments requirements. Our recommendations areas follows : 
(a) Judicial System and A dvisers.Our special representative should be instructed to satisfy himself as to thepresent working of the judicial system and as to the Emperor&apos;s intentions withregard to the future. Subject to His Majesty&apos;s Government being satisfied on thispoint, the Emperor&apos;s desire to exercise freedom of choice in regard to his judicialand other advisers need not be contested.(b) Military Mission.We regard it as essential to retain a British Military Mission, and would see strong objections to a joint Anglo-American Mission. W^e would add that,in our view, the retention of the Mission is indeed as essential to the maintenanceof the Emperor&apos;s position as to the protection of our own interests. The Emperorhas proposed four conditions : (1) That the Military Mission should in future come under the authorityof the Ethiopian Ministry of War instead of the General OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, East Africa;(2) That the privileges of the Mission should be laid down in instructionsto be agreed upon between His Imperial Majesty and the Governmentof the United Kingdom;(3) That the Ethiopian Minister of War and the head of the Mission should consult about the disposition and the movement of any members ofthe Mission; and(4) That the Military Mission should be retained until the Emperor nolonger requires its services, or until he can obtain suitable officers to take its place.There is obviously strong objection to condition (1) and we recommend thatit should be refused. We recommend that conditions (2) and (3) should beaccepted, and that we should press for an amendment to condition (4) so as toensure that the Military Mission would be retained during the currency of theAgreement or at least that it would not be dispensed with save after consultationwith His Majesty&apos;s Government.(c) Boundaries, Reserved. Territories, and Franco-Ethiopian Railway.We recommend that the instructions to our special representative as to theline to be taken on these matters should be as follows : (i) Our representative should aim at retaining the status quo in regardto the Reserved Areas (excluding, if necessary, the strip of landthrough which the Franco-Ethiopian railway runs) and the Ogaden,and such of the cantonments as we still require,(ii) We should aim at a settlement on the basis of a lease of the ReservedAreas which fall within the existing boundaries of Abyssinia. the ogaden area, which had previously been included in Italian Somali-land, should, however, remain under British Military administration,without prejudice to the Emperor&apos;s rights, until the Peace Treaty.(iii) Any necessary reassurance should be given to the Emperor that such arrangements were without derogation from his sovereignty in these areas.(iv) Provided that priority for supplies could be secured, we need not press for retention of control of the railway. The land occupied by therailway would not then be required. The surrender of the railwayshould be conditional upon its being held by the Ethiopian Custodianof Enemy Property until the end of the war.(v) The cantonment at Jigjiga is required for the purpose of controlling the grazing areas. There are no military grounds for retainingcontrol of that at Diredawa if control of the railway is not to beretained. That containing the Addis Ababa airfield is no longer required, and may be relinquished.We recommend that further departmental consideration be given to theposition in regard to the customs enclaves at Diredawa and Jigjiga^ as to which full information was not available to us during our deliberations.(d) Airfields.We see no objection to the proposals in Article IX of the Emperor&apos;s redraft.
(e) Finance and Currency.We recommend that:  (i) The currency position should be safeguarded in any settlement; and(ii) The question of the precise degree of further financial assistance tobe given to the Emperor should be left open pending investigation bythe delegation.III. Extent of Co-operation with the United States Government.14. The approaches made in recent months to the United States government by the Ethiopians for various forms of assistance may well represent a tendency to play off this country against the United States. The general position was,however, considered at the time of the recent conversations with Mr. Stettinius.An understanding was then reached between him and the Foreign Office that&quot;both Governments were interested in aiding the re-establishment of a stable,independent government in Ethiopia and that there should be close collaborationand co-operation between them for this purpose.&quot; When this matter came beforethe Cabinet on the&apos;28th June last, the Foreign Secretary was disposed to think(W.P. (44) 333, paragraph 6 (3)) that the wise policy for us to adopt in relationto Ethiopia would be one of collaboration with the United States of america to provide Ethiopia on a joint basis with financial, technical and material assistance, and he contemplated that among the matters to be dealt with on ajoint footing would be frontier adjustments and the construction of the LakeTsana dam.15. We have carefully considered this important issue. We fully recognise the arguments in favour of the course of action tentatively suggested by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to which we have just referred. But weare clear in the result that the balance of advantage would appear to rest in ourpursuing a more independent policy. And we recommend that we should not go beyond informing the Americans that we are sending a representative to Ethiopiato negotiate a new Agreement with the Emperor, that we shall probably agree torelaxations in the matter of advisers, and that we shall accept the Emperor&apos;sproposals as regards our diplomatic representation and aviation matters. But ifthe Americans press for our views on other aspects of the Emperor&apos;s proposals,of which they have cognisance, we think we should not withhold them. We should,moreover, be very ready, if the point is raised by the Americans, to undertake to pursue a joint, policy in regard to capital development, to be worked out afterthe Agreement with the Emperor is concluded.16. If our proposals, as set out above, are accepted by the War Cabinet,detailed instructions to our representative will no doubt be prepared depart-mentally.Summary of Recommendations.(i) We recommend that negotiations should be reopened with the Emperor,with the object of securing an interim agreement to tide over theperiod before a fresh Treaty can be negotiated,(ii) We recommend that the approach to the Emperor should be made on thebasis of paragraphs 11 and 12 of this Report, which propose an offer to receive a representative of the Emperor, and the sending of aspecial representative to Addis Ababa to negotiate, with powers toinform himself on matters relevant to the Agreement; the notice of termination of the present agreement to be suspended meanwhile.(iii) We recommend that detailed instructions should be given to our repre-sentative as set out in paragraph 13.(iv) We recommend that our co-operation with the United States Govern-ment in relation to the matters to be dealt with in the agreement should be limited and subject to the guidance set out in paragraph 15above; but that we should be ready, if the point is raised by the americans, to undertake to pursue a joint policy in regard to capital development, to be worked out after the Agreement with the Emperoris concluded.J. A.(on behalf of the Committee).Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2%th July, 1944.
