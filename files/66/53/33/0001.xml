THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 433.8th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.DESPATCH OF BRITISH FORCES TO GREECE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE object of sending British troops into Greece immediately the Germanswithdraw would be (a) To prevent civil war or anarchy and to ensure the speedy restoration of order so as to enable relief supplies to be brought in and distributed.(&amp;) To preserve the traditional connexion between Great Britain and Greece,which is indispensable to our political influence in S.E. europe and to our strategic position in the Eastern Mediterranean, by securing the early establishment of a Government friendly to us.2. The British officers now in Greece are all agreed that, unless Britishtroops arrive the moment the Germans withdraw, there will be serious disorderor civil war in many parts of Greece. M. Papandreou is also of this view andhas recently threatened to resign unless he is given ail assurance that Britishtroops will be sent in. The majority of the Greek people will hold us responsiblefor preventing disorder or civil war since it is we who have armed the guerrillas.Moreover, it will be impossible to hold a free and convincing plebiscite to decide the future regime for Greece until law and order are enforced and maintained.3. We have also an inescapable obligation to send relief supplies to Greeceas soon as the country is liberated. Plans are in hand, but it will be impossibleto carry them out if the country is in a state of anarchy. Any failure to providerelief, from whatever cause, would be laid at our door and would do serious and lasting; damage to British influence in Greece.4. If we are to maintain any political influence in S.E. Europe and,above all, our strategical position in the Eastern Mediterranean after thewar, it is essential that Greece should be ruled by a Government friendly tous. There is no doubt that the extremist leaders of E.A.M. plan to seize powerwhen the Germans withdraw, and although they would only be supported bya minority of the Greek people, they might well succeed in this aim if theyare not forestalled by the arrival of British troops. Owing to the political viewsof the E.A.M. leaders and to the fact that Soviet influence may in any case bepredominant in Roumania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, an E.A.M. Government in greece would almost inevitably look to Russia rather than to this country for support.5. I regard it as essential that British influence in Greece and the traditional connexion between the two countries should be preserved, but unlessBritish forces can be sent in there is a serious danger that the Greek people,who still look to us for assistance, will lose faith in Great Britain and that aGovernment will come into power which would bring the country under Sovietdomination.6. Notes on (a) the position of the King of the Hellenes, and (b) the attitudeof the Soviet Government are contained in the Annex to this memorandum.A. E.8th August, 1944.12459   [27965]r
ANNEX.(a) Position of the King of the Hellenes.The King of the Hellenes has announced that he will come to no decision about his own return to Greece until the country is liberated, and that he will thenact in agreement with his Government. The Greek Government announced on the12th June that in their opinion the King should await the decision of a plebiscite.Unless circumstances change radically between now and the time when Greece isliberated, it is therefore probable that the King will be advised by his government not to return immediately and that he will accept this advice. The question isone which will have to be settled between the King and the Greek Government,and there should be no cause for our intervention. The issue will not in anycase be affected by a decision to send a British force into Greecewhen the Germanswithdraw.(b) A attitude of Soviet Government.Until recently the Soviet Government seemed disposed to accept an arrange-ment by which we should take the lead in Greek affairs while they took the lead in roumania. No decision has been reached and the Soviet Government^ views arenow awaited as a result of their consultation with the United States Government.On the night of the 25th to 26th July, however, they sent in a military mission toE.L.A.S. Headquarters without informing or consulting us in advance. Themission is apparently intended to be permanent, but we have no other information about its scope or functions. This development may mean that the Soviet Govern-ment are determined to promote the establishment of an E.A.M. government in greece after the liberation, even if this brings them into direct conflict with our policy. .Tt is reasonable to hope, however, that this is not their intention andthat we may still induce them to allow us to play the principal role in Greece. Inthat event it should be possible to dissuade them from giving diplomatic and still less military support to E.A.M. if the latter make any attempt to seize power in Greece.
