THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted /or the War Cabinet.   July 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 401.21st July, 1944.WAR CABINET.PUBLIC ALARM SYSTEM.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.1. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 10th July (W.M. (44) 89thConclusions, Minute 8) I was invited to bring before the Civil Defence Committeethe question of improving the public warning system, with particular referenceto the possibility of an extension of the system of giving warning of imminent danger, within the normal &apos;&apos; alert&apos;&apos; warning.2. The matter was considered by the Civil Defence Committee at their meetings on the 13th and 20th July and in the interval was investigated in detail by an official committee under the Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Food.3. Various methods of giving a warning of imminent danger have been examined and the considerations which apply to them are set out in my memorandum to the Civil Defence Committee of the 11th July (C.D.C. (44) 21)and the memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Foodof the 18th July (C.D.C. (44) 30). The general conclusions reached by the civil defence Committee were that the use of an audible signal such as the sirensthemselves, gunfire or maroons, should be ruled out, principally owing to the impossibility of localising a sound signal sufficiently. The Committee were agreedthat if there is to be a system of imminent danger Avarnings it should consist ofvisible signals displayed on premises connected to the industrial alarm scheme(of which there are 4,000 in the Greater London area) and that these could be supplemented by making the bell signals, at present given in these premises,audible to the public outside. The use of bell signals for this purpose is not opento the same objections as the use of other sound signals since the sound of thebells would only be audible at a short distance.4. The Committee were, however, unable to reach any decision as to whethera system of imminent danger warnings should or should not be instituted and I.therefore, think it necessary to see the advice of my colleagues in the War Cabineton this fundamental point of principle.5. The arguments in favour of instituting a system of imminent dangerwarnings for the public are briefly as follows : (i) Such a warning would save a certain number of casualties in the streets.(ii) During long alerts it is impossible for the public to know when and where individual flying bombs are likely to arrive. It is represented that the strain on people&apos;s nerves involved in listening for the soundof the bomb&apos;s engine is considerable. Moreover, the sound of the engine cannot be heard in some streets where there is heavy traffic,(iii) Workers who receive imminent danger warnings in factories aredissatisfied because their families do not receive the same warnings asthey do.[27863]
6.   The arguments against instituting the system are : (i) It is impossible to devise a system which will be either universal orwholly effective. The system of visible signals supplemented by bellswould suffer from the following limitations : (a) The visible signals could not be seen from all parts of the streetssince they would be masked by high buildings.(b) Only those parts of London where there are premises connectedto the industrial alarm system would be covered.   Additionscould be made fairly quickly in order to extend the system ofvisible signals, but it would never be comprehensive,(ii) An imminent danger warning might have a bad effect on morale, andthe institution of such a system of warnings would be the antithesisof the &quot; carry-on &quot; attitude of mind which the Prime Minister hasurged people &quot;to adopt to the flying-bomb attacks.(iii) If an official system of imminent danger warnings is instituted theGovernment will have to tell people what they ought to do. For thegeneral public it might suffice to say that the Government onlyundertake the responsibility of telling them when there is imminent danger and when it has passed and that everybody must do what he thinks best about it. But the drivers of public transport will certainlyneed directions, and it is difficult to see how they can be told to disregard the signal if they are told to stop and allow passengers toget under cover there must be disorganisation of schedules, dislocation of traffic and quite possibly more accidents in the streets.(iv) The institution of an imminent danger warning for the public, whichwould necessarily have to be less reliable and selective than the&quot; spotters&apos; warning &quot; which is given in factories, might have a bad effect on production.7. There is undoubtedly considerable public demand for some sort ofimminent.danger warning. This was impressed on me at the private meeting ofMembers of Parliament held on the 11th July and again at Question Time onthe 20th July. The Press (particularly the Daily Mail and the Daily Express)have also emphasised its desirability. I doubt, however, whether opinion isunanimous, and it could easily switch the other way in the light of experienceof the operation of a public imminent danger warning. The position has beencomplicated by the introduction of a considerable number of unofficial methodsof giving imminent danger warnings to the public by means of flags, klaxons, &amp;c.,which have been adopted by individual concerns on their own initiative. Whetheror not it is decided to introduce a special system of imminent danger warningsit seems to me essential that the signals which are already being displayed orsounded should be standardised as much as possible. Should an imminent dangerwarning system be introduced it should be on the lines of paragraph 3 of thismemorandum and the public should be told at the time of its limitations. It goeswithout saying that, even so, the Government will be held responsible for these limitations.8. There is a wide divergence of view between the Departments concerned on the desirability of introducing a warning of imminent danger. The supply departments and the Ministry of Labour, among others, support such a scheme,whilst the Ministry of Health, Board of Education, the Commissioner of police and the London Regional Commissioner consider it undesirable.9.   As it seems to me, the choice before the War Cabinet lies between (i) extending the existing industrial warning system on the lines ofparagraph 3 above and standardising the signals; and(ii) standardising the signals but otherwise leaving the present system todevelop itself without official control.II.
