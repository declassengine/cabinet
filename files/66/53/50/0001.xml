NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. A successful landing by Allied troops on the south coast of France,covered by the Allied Fleet, has been made. Fighter protection was afforded bycarrier-borne aircraft. ...     . .Attacks have been made on shipping and U-boats off the Biscay ports.Four U-boats have been sunk and four possibly sunk.Norwegian &quot;Waters.2. Aircraft from H.M. ships Nabob, Trumpeter (escort carriers),Indefatigable (aircraft carrier), escorted by Kent and Devonshire (cruisers), and eight destroyers, including two Canadian destroyers, on the 10th attacked the airfield at Gossen, near Kristiansund (N), and other targets. Two armed ships,an oil cistern and two hangars were set on fire and six Me. 110 destroyed : threeradar and two W/T stations were also attacked, and mines were laid off theNorwegian coast.  Our losses, were two aircraft.Home Waters.3. H.M.S. Walpole (destroyer) on the 14th engaged and drove off six E-boatson the convoy route off Orfordness and inflicted damage. They were later inter-cepted by M.T.Bs. and two of them further damaged, one being set on fire. early on the 16th six E-boats were engaged off Harwich by H.M.S. Southdown (destroyer)and withdrew to Ostend.H.M.S. Thornborough (frigate) early on the 11th encountered six R-boats anda trawler off Cap d&apos;Antifer. The enemy were attacked later by U.S. P.T. boats.On the following day three M.T.Bs. attacked eight or more R-boats and anauxiliary-in the same area; the auxiliary was probably torpedoed. Early on the13th two M.T.Bs. engaged and damaged six R-boats near Berck (S. of Boulogne).4. The totals unloaded up to p.m. on the 15th are : 1,840,775 men, 392,636vehicles and 2,476,203 tons of stores.5. The following casualties have occurred in the assault area : H.M.S. Vestal(minesweeper) was damaged by underwater explosion on the 10th. H.M.S. Alba-tross, acting as a repair ship, was damaged in the same way on the 11th and was later towed to port: she had 5 killed, 50 missing and 50 wounded. H.M.S. Barcoch(boom defence vessel) was damaged.A human torpedo was destroyed in the assault area on the 11th.6. In the Channel Islands H.M.S. Rodney on the 12th bombarded the12-inch gun battery on Alderney and silenced it. U.S. P.T. boats attacked a convoy off La Corbiere, Jersey, on the same day and damaged one ship. On thefollowing night H.M. ships Saumarez and Onslatight (destroyers) engaged and damaged a convoy of three minesweepers and a cargo ship, sailing from Jerseyto Guernsey, which had been intercepted by U.S. P.T. boats. Heavy fire was encountered from shore batteries : many bits were observed on the enemy. the destroyers suffered 12 slight casualties. Three L.S.Ts., with ammunition, petrol and stores for U.S. troops were sailed across the Channel and beached without incident east of Morlaix on the 11th.Bay of Biscay.7. Early on the 12th the 12th (Canadian) Escort Group south of Brest settwo trawlers on fire and damaged a cargo ship. Later H.M. ships Diadem(cruiser) and Onslow (destroyer), and the Polish destroyer Piorun, off La Rochellesank a large sperrbrecher which had been sighted and attacked by a Halifax.Three attacks on enemy shipping off La Rochelle were carried out early on the15th by H.M. ships Mauritius (cruiser), Ursa (destroyer) and Iroquois (Canadiandestroyer). In the first attack four ships were intercepted : one was left .sinkingand one on fire, and a tanker was driven ashore badly damaged. Shore defencesengaged our forces. In the other attacks, further north, one small tanker, twocargo ships and two minesweepers were driven ashore, the latter four vessels on fire and abandoned.On the night of the 15th/16th. M.T.Bs. 724 and 787 probably sank a trawlernorth of Belle He.
Mediterranean.8. The successful landing of Allied troops on the morning of the 15th on thesouth coast of France between Agay and the Baie de Cavalaire was covered by theAllied Fleet, and fighter protection was afforded by naval aircraft from Alliedescort carriers.The assault convoys sailed from Naples, and the support groups from Malta,Taranto and Palermo.Two enemy corvettes were sunk by the U.S.S. Somers (destroyer) south of the he de Cros.The Allied Fleet was composed of 5 battleships, 22 cruisers, 9 escort carriers,109 destroyers, 84 minesweepers, 380 assault ships, 131 personnel and M.T. ships,3 anti-aircraft ships, 2 gun-boats and 1 monitor.9. ELM. S/M Unswerving on the 10th torpedoed the German ss. Toni (638tons), which was escorted by one R-boat, off Milo.II.M. S/M Vigorous on the 27th July sank an armed caique by gunfire offSuda Bay, Crete.On the night of the 6th/7th an M.L. entered Port lero, Mitylene, where shecaptured a caique and bombarded German strong points.East Indies.10. On the 1st H.M. S/M Storm sank by gunfire 3 coasters and 1 schoonerin the Southern Moscos Channel (off Tavoy, S. Burma). All the ships hadJapanese officers.  On the 23rd July she sank a coaster by gunfire.Pacific.Philippines.11. On the 12th a U.S. S/M successfully attacked a south-bound convoycomprising two large tankers, two ships and three escort vessels off Mindoro Island(south of Manila, Philippines), where considerable movement of shipping has been observed.Dutch New Guinea.12. U.S. P.T. boats have supported advanced patrols moving westwards fromSansapor.   They also destroyed laden barges in Geelvink Bay.On the 14th a U.S. frigate bombarded enemy installations near Wardo River(Biak Island) and near Napido (Supiori Island).Netv Britain.13.   An Australian sloop shelled Wide Bay (Gazelle Peninsula) on the 12th.Anti-Submarine Operations.14. Twenty-nine attacks were reported during the week, 14 of these by shore-based aircraft, one by carrier-borne aircraft, and 14 by warships.On the 10th one U-boat was sunk, and another possibly sunk, off Belle He :the former by two Liberators and H.M. ships Wren (sloop) and Loch Killin(frigate) of the 2nd Escort Group; the latter by a Liberator and ELM. Canadianships Ottawa and Chaudiere (destroyer) of the 11th (Canadian) Escort Group.Towards evening, further south, a U-boat was attacked by the 2nd Escort group and a Sunderl&amp;nd, and was sunk ten hours later by H.M.S. Starling (sloop), mostof the crew being rescued. A Halifax possibly sank a U-boat on the 12th off the mouth of the Gironde. On the 13th a U-boat was sunk off La Rochelle by aSunderland : survivors were picked up by the 11th (Canadian) Escort Group..In mid-Channel H.M.S. Orchis (corvette) on the 15th sank a U-boat, south-east of the Isle of Wight, which had torpedoed an L.S.T.; one survivor from theU-boat was rescued. On the same day a U-boat reported by- a Liberator off BelleHe was possibly sunk by frigates of the 3rd Escort Group.In the Indian Ocean H.M.S. Findhorn (frigate) and H.M.I.S. Godavari(sloop) possible&apos;sank a U-boat west of the Seychelles on the 12th.Enemy Intelligence.15.   Photographic reconnaissance on the 12th showed the Hipper at Pillau,and the lutzow, which has been active with the Scheer in the Eastern Baltic, and[28028] r        B
the Emden at Gdynia. The Koln was at Swinemiincle on the 14th, and the Leipzigat Copenhagen on the 7th. Shipbuilding appears to have been abandoned atKonigsberg, where the Seydlitz- has been further dismantled. The building ofsmall destroyers at Elbing is being pushed forward : three have been completed and three laid down since April.The German A/A cruiser Niobe (ex-Dutch Gelderland, 3,512 tons, built in1897) has been bombed and sunk by Russian aircraft at Kotka in Finland, where she was used as a coast defence and gunnery training ship.16. At Nantes, two of the five Agile class destroyers fitting out have been sunk at their berths, as well as two medium-sized ships. Demolition has beencarried out at each end of the Quai President Wilson, though in between thereis a stretch of some 1,300 feet of undamaged quay. Part of the Quai des Antilleshas been blown up, and the large floating dock near the entrance to Port Maritimehas been sunk, as also has the dock at the Quai Usine Brulee. The floating craneat Chantiers de Bretagne is partly under water.U-boats.17. There are believed to be four of five U-boats operating in the english channel, and one off the north Cornish coast. There has been much activity inthe Bay of Biscay, where some U-boats are apparently being transferred to thesouthern ports. Others may be expected to operate in the Atlantic beforereturning to their Norwegian bases, where there is already a force of at least 50.This transfer would involve the use of ports of which only two have shelters,viz., Trondheim with covered pens for 7-8 U-boats now ready, and for a further6-8 to be ready between October and January; and Bergen with a covered penfor two boats now, and for eight more by November.Reconnaissance shows an increase in the number of U-boats to 40 at Pillauand 25 at Konigsberg.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. During the week one store-ship was seriously damaged by underwaterexplosion in the assault area.Protection of Seaborne Trade.19. During the week ending the 13th, 798 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 346 were in ocean convoys and452 in British coastal convoys. Two escort carriers. 43 destroyers (including25 U.S. destroyers), and 86 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes, were employee!on escort duties. Four homebound convoys, consisting of 205 ships, and twooutward-bound convoys, of 141 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.20. Mines have been laid by surface craft in the Channel and by aircraft in the Dortmund-Ems Canal, off the Biscay ports, and in the Danube.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.21.   There have been no reports of enemy minelaying in Home Waters.In the assault area minelaying by enemy aircraft was again on a small scale,six mines or less having been laid on each, of three nights. During the week33 ground mines were destroyed, 19 of them off Barfleur, and five self-detonatecl.In Cherbourg harbour no mines were destroyed during the week, but anoiling barge was sank by mine in the Grande Rade and a fuelling trawler was damaged : a Y.M/S was damaged by a ground mine. The naval port parties havefinished their work and returned to England.Twenty-four mines were destroyed off Leghorn.The mine totals are 5,330 ground and 5,577 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.22. Reconnaissance of the Eastern Baltic shows that only three ships whichmight be used as troopships have arrived from the Western Baltic. There is,however, activity among a number of large depot ships which had previouslyremained at the same berth for about three years.
23. None of the large ore-carrying ships have been reported during theweek, but some of the smaller ones have sailed between Bilbao and Bayonne. Itwas reported on the 14th that the ore traffic had ceased owing to congestion atBayonne.24. The German s.s. Johanna (1,899 tons) sailed from Istanbul for Bourgason the 8th in ballast.The Polish Navy.25. Under the terms of the Anglo-Polish Naval Agreement, H.M.S. Danae(cruiser) is to be taken over on loan by the Polish Navy.MILITARY SITUATION.North-West France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.26. Operations during the last week have developed excellently. WhileU.S., British and Canadian Armies have maintained unremitting pressure on theenemy from the north, the Third U.S. Army, under General Patton. which sweptbehind the German positions in the Bocage country and turned north fromLe Mans, has advanced to the area of Argentan and further east to Dreux,Chartres and Orleans. The Germans are being forced to attempt-a major with-drawal and are fighting desperately to hold open the shoulders of the Argentan-Falaise gap in order to extricate their threatened divisions. It is early to assess the consequences of this battle, but it is clear that a major tactical victory hasbeen won and that, in General Eisenhower&apos;s words, the Germans are taking agood beating.12th U.S. Army Group.27. In Brittany serious resistance has been eliminated outside the mainfortress ports of Brest and Lorient, which are invested, and at St. Malo, wherethe citadel remains a stubborn centre of resistance. Dinard has been occupied,while, in the south of the peninsula, Nantes has fallen.On the right flank of the Normandy sector, the First U.S. Army had heavy fighting in the Vire-Mortain-Domfront area at the beginning of the week, butresistance has been decreasing and it has pushed forward beyond Mortain to occupy Tinchebray and Domfront. On the extreme right flank of the Army, a.thrust in strength N.E. from Mayenne made rapid progress and established the forward positions on the line Carrouges-Domfront.The Third U.S. Army, under General Patton, has made spectacular progressin its wide encircling move south of the German positions in Normandy. Afterthe capture of Le Mans on the 9th, a strong corps, with armoured formationsleading, swung north and made such good progress that by the 13th it Avas frimly established in the Argentan area and was thus threatening the German armies in Normandy with encirclement. When the Germans appreciated their danger,they began to switch their Panzer divisions from the Mortain area to meet thisthrust and they are fighting hard to prevent it from joining with  the Falaisethrust from the north.Meanwhile, other forces of the Third U.S. Army have pushed out in strengthfurther east to Dreux and Chartres and an armoured column has enteredOrleans.21st Army Group.28. The Second British Army, in the central Normandy sector, has madedefinite advances along its whole front in the course of heavy fighting. At thebeginning of the week the main advances were east of Vire, south of Mont Pincontowards Conde-sur-Noireau and in the Thury Harcourt area, where the bridge-head across the Orne was steadily expanded in the face of bitter oppositionuntil the salient between the British, and Canadians was finally eliminated onthe 12th.Since then, the heavy pressure on this front has brought further advances.On the 15th, the road between Conde-sur-lNoireau and Falaise was cut, and onthe 16th, British forces on the right of their sector pressed forward and wheeledeastwards to the general line Conde-sur-Noireau-Flers. On the British left flank the forward positions are some ten miles south of Thury Harcourt.
In the Canadian sector, the drive S.E. astride the Caen-Falaise road, which by the 10th had resulted in an advance of some ten miles, on that day came up against a strong screen of anti-tank guns and heavily-defended positions, whichhalted progress for the next five days. On the 15th, the Canadians put in anew attack east of the road, after a very heavy preliminary air bombardment,and on the 16th. leading troops were fighting in Falaise.Meanwhile, when the drive on Falaise was brought to a standstill on the10th, attacks on the left flank of the salient extended it to Vimont, where heavyresistance was encountered, and beyond St, Sylvain. These attacks have continued and by the 16th had secured small brigdeheads across the Dives, and the capture of Vimont, St. Pierre and Morteaux.Southern France.29. Operations against Southern France began during the night 14th/15th. British and U.S. airborne forces were dropped north of Le Muy in theArgens valley; U.S. Special Service Forces were landed on two islands 20 miles east of Toulon and French commandos on the mainland at Cap Negre, five miles west of the Baie de Cavalaire.Assault divisions were put ashore the following morning on a front of 25 milesover beaches between Agay and the Baie de Cavalaire.Defences on the islands of Levant and Port Cros were rapidly over-borneand the garrisons captured; the French landing at Cap Negre was alsosuccessful and in 24 hours all Allied landings were firmly secured and contacthad been made with the French commandos. Ste. Maxime and Cogolin,three miles inland from the Golfe de St. Tropez, had been captured. .Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.30. A Russian attack west of Pskov has made good progress towards theimportant railway junction of Valka; if the latter were captured, all railcommunication would be cut between the German forces in Estonia and those inLatvia. The Russians have also gained a little ground against strong german resistance east and S.E. of Riga and have widened their salient south of Tukums.N.W. and S.W. of Kovno, counter-attacks have stemmed the Russian advancebut have regained no ground.Central Sector.31. On the 11th, after a short lull, the Russians renewed their attacksbetween Suwalki and Warsaw and pressed the Germans back on a broad frontwest of Bialystok and north of Siedlce. In the immediate neighbourhood ofWarsaw the Germans are making every effort to hold off the Russians and have succeeded in doing so up to the present. N.E. of the town they have forced theRussians to yield a little ground. Further south the Russian bridgehead over theSan has been the scene of heavy fighting ; early in the week the Russians extendedit slightly in the direction of Kielce, but in the last few days they have been held up by German counter-attacks.General.32. Once again the extent of the Russian advances has been much lessthan in the early weeks of the summer offensive. A pause for consolidation was probably inevitable, and it was also to be expected that, as the fighting movedwestwards, German resistance would stiffen. It is worth noting that in thepast two weeks, German counter-attacks have succeeded in halting the Russianstemporarily but have regained no ground. It appears, furthermore, that theGermans are not in a position to launch a full counter-offensive.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)33.   There has been little change during the week.On the Adriatic sector Polish forces crossed the River Cesano on the 10th,and by the following day a bridgehead had been established. The enemy hasbeen cleared from the area between the rivers Misa and Cesano to a distance of 12 miles inland.   Since the 11th, activity has been confined to patrol work.
Further inland our mobile forces followed up an enemy withdrawal in thearea S.W. of Pergola and occupied Frontone on the 12th.In the central sector Indian troops have maintained contact with theenemy through patrols, but have not made any forward progress. Further tothe west a British armoured formation has pushed forward a little in themountainous area which lies to the N.E. of Figline.Fighting has continued in and around Florence. British forces are established on the north bank of the River Arno immediately to the east of thecity. In the city itself the Germans withdrew to the north of the Mugone Canal,a waterway parallel to and about 1,500 yards north of the Arno, on the 11th.The area between the canal and the river then became a &quot; no man&apos;s land&quot;with Fascist snipers operating against civilians and our troops w*ho were endeavouring to cross the Arno. On the 12th, Italian partisans cleared theFascists from the Old City, an area about half a mile square, north of the Arno.British and Indian troops immediately moved in. Since then our troops havebeen increasing their hold, on the Old City and now have the main railway station in their hands. The enemy still holds the town to the north of the MugoneCanal, and have thus prevented any relief being given to approximately 100,000civilians. Inhabitants of the Old City have, however, been given food and supplies. To the west of Florence a small enemy pocket south of the Arnoand west of Empoli was cleared by New Zealand troops on the 11th. On thenext day the town of Lastra fell to Indian troops. The south bank of the RiverArno is, therefore, now held by Allied forces from Florence to the sea.In the Fifth Army sector activity has been confined to vigorous patrol work.Enemy attempts to get patrols across the river into our lines have been frustrated.Yugoslavia.34. The Germans using a division recently arrived in Yugoslavia are makinga determined drive westwards into Montenegro The Partisans are giving ground in face of this thrust and have withdrawn from Andrijevica and from Berane(ten miles north of Andrijevica); the German drive continues westwards.Enemy attacks from Pljevlja and from Niksic (50 miles N.W. and west ofAndrijevica respectively) have been driven off by the Partisans.The Partisan battle group of two divisions which has been recuperatingin the Montenegro area has made a fresh incursion into Serbia, where it hassuccessfully routed three Cetnik brigades.During the night of the 9th/10th, an Allied Commando party operating from Italy destroyed the road bridge at Ossero linking the islands of Chersoand Lussin off the Istrian Peninsula. This attack was carried out without loss to our troops.Greece.35. On the 9th, three German columns were converging on Karpenision(30 miles west of Lamia).  Some resistance by E.L.A.S. forces has been reported.E.L.A.S. troops attacked a German force some 20 miles N.E. of Karpenisionon the 9th and killed 200.Burma.36. Our troops have pushed further south down the Imphal-Tiddim roadagainst slight opposition and have now almost reached the Assam-Burma border.In northern Burma our troops captured the village of Taungni on the 11th,killing over 100 Japanese and capturing much equipment.Pacific Theatre.Guam.37. All organised resistance ceased on the 10th. Over 10,971 japanese are known to have perished. 1,214 U.S. troops were killed and their totalcasualties amounted to 7,247.New Guinea.38.   U.S. troops in the Vogelkop area are encountering only light resistance.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.39. Home-based aircraft gave full support to Allied troops in Normandyand Brittany and heavily attacked communications and airfields in France andthe Low Countries and industrial targets in Germany.In the south of France, the M.A.A.F. heavily attacked gun positions, bridgesand radar stations.   Six oil refineries were bombed at Ploesti.Flying-bomb activity against Southern England was on a reduced scale.United Kingdom.40. Flying-bomb attacks are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and home security.&quot; During the week, against the flying-bombs, fighters flew a total of1,887 sorties by clay and 424 by night and destroyed 102.No other important enemy activity has been reported.Home Waters.41. Coastal Command aircraft, which flew 1,529 sorties during the week,made several successful attacks on enemy shipping; 18 aircraft are missing.On the 10th, a convoy of five or six ships, with ten escorts, was attackedoff Wilhelmshaven; two ships and four minesweepers were left burning, one ofthe latter probably sank, and one escort blew up. Oft&apos; Cap cFAntifer, a convoy of three armed trawlers and five E/R boats was straddled Avith bombs and twoof the E/JR boats were hit by cannon. On the 12th and 13th, one cargo ship was set on fire off Oieron, in the Bay of Biscay, two sperrbrechers were leftenveloped in smoke off Royan and the tanker Sudetenland was seriously7 damagedduring an attack on Brest.On the 14th, one destroyer, one sperrbrecher and two small trawlerauxiliaries were attacked off Le Verdon; the sperrbrecher was left on fire andthe destroy7er and both trawlers were damaged. On the same day, attacks weremade on a 2.000-ton depot ship and several other ships in the Gironde; the depotship was left in flames and numerous hits were observed on the other vessels.On the 16th, a minesweeper and an armed coaster, which were aground north ofLa Pallice, were set on fire and two E-boats were damaged off Le Treport.Bomber Command aircraft laid 624 sea-mines; five aircraft are missing;.Western Front.42. A total of 38,646 sorties was flown during the week and 40,062 tons of bombs were dropped.Enerny* fighter activity was on the lowest scale since the lauding in Normandy,reaching a maximum of only 250 sorties per day at the beginning of the weekand declining progressively to about 100/150 at the end. The majority7 of theaircraft failed to reach the battle area, so that the contribution of the fightersin a close support role was negligible. Long-range bomber operations were ona small scale and were directed mainly against ground targets in the Battle Area.Enemy losses in combat were 182 aircraft destroyed, 23 probably destroyed and 32 damaged; 155 Allied bombers and 197 fighters and fighter-bombers are missing.France and the Lotv Countries^43. The Allied air forces gave the fullest support to our troops in Normandyand Brittany by continuously7 attacking enemy troops, armour, gun positions,dumps and other targets in the battle area and communications leading up tothe front. In the battle area, OA7er 7,000 tons of bombs were dropped andhundreds of rocket projectiles fired. In one attack alone on enemy concentra-tions at Potigny on the 14th in support of the First Canadian Army about,650 tons Avere dropped with good effect. More than 10,000 tons were dropped on railway centres and junctions and on road and raihvay bridges in north-eastern, eastern and central France and in Belgium. The effectiveness of Allied air attacks may be gauged by the results achie\7cd in daylight on the 12th, when208 locomotives were destroyed and 128 damaged, 724 cars destroyed and 1,500damaged, 197 oil cars destroyed and 107 damaged and 297 other vehiclesdestroyed and 178 damaged. Many barges Avere destroyed on the Seine and otherrivers.* The results of some of the attacks referred to above are given in Appendix VII.
Heavy attacks were also made on airfields in France and the Low Countries,8,400 tons being dropped with good results. About 2.200 tons were dropped on fuel-storage depots in the Paris, Bordeaux, La Pallice and Blois areas.Among other targets attacked were enemy defences, block ships and U-boatpens at Brest (1,781 tons), U-boat pens at Bordeaux and La Pallice (501 tons),ammunition clumps near Tours, Beauvais and Rouen (558 tons) and flying-bombsites in north-eastern France (400 tons).Germany *44.

During the week ended dawn on the 15th, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 11,274 sorties, of which 2.741 were by heavy bombers;8,884 tons of bomb- were dropped.   102 Allied aircraft, including 37 heavy bombers, are missing and 15 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Allied aircraft made heavy attacks on gun positions, bridges and radarstations in the south of France. In Italy, attacks were maintained on enemy communications, and on the N.W. coast gun positions were heavily bombed.Communications and transport in Yugoslavia and oil refineries at Ploesti were attacked.A decline in enemy activity throughout the week, particularly in reactions to Allied strategic bombing, has been very noticeable. Enemy reaction to Alliedbombing in the south of France has been negligible.South of France and North-West Italy.46. On the three days preceding the Allied landings in the south of France,U.S. heavies of the M.A.A.F. dropped a total of 3,500 tons of bombs on enemygun positions in the areas of Genoa, Savona, Toulon, Marseilles and Sete. Duringthis period similar targets were attacked by about 700 medium bombers, includinggun positions in the areas, of St. Tropez and Cannes. About 1,200 fighter-bombers attacked gun positions on the French/Italian coast, and in additionattacked radar stations, bridges, coastal watchers, minesweepers, the airfields atMontelimar and Bergamo, and other military targets. Prior to the landings,heavies also dropped about 300 tons on bridges in the Avignon and Valence areas.Heavy and medium bombers made night attacks on lights on the coast, portinstallations at Genoa, and shipping and the docks at Marseilles; light bombers* The results of some of the attacks referred to above arc given in Appendix VII.
attacked airfields and transport. On the night 14th /15th, 405 Dakotas success-fully dropped paratroops in the Le Muy (22 miles W.S.W. of Cannes) area without opposition.On the 15th, 383 U.S. heavies dropped 739 tons on targets on seven beachesbetween Frejus and Cape Camarat, and five bridges over the River Rhone, southof Valence. Results on four beaches were good and three of the river bridgeswere hit. 276 medium bombers attacked gun positions between Cape Benat andAntheor, 24 light bombers barracks in the Cannes area, and 600 fighter-bombers gun positions, strong points and bridges in the areas of the landings.313 Dakotas towed gliders to the Le Muy area and 36 Mustangs provided cover for the arrival of these aircraft and attacked the Antheor barracks. Furtherreports of air activity on the 15th in the assault area are not at present available.On the 16th preliminary reports state that Fortresses dropped 260 tons on railway bridges at St. Pierre d&apos;Albigny, St. Vallier, St. Grenoble and Isere-le-Valence.Northern Italy.47. The main effort of the Tactical Air Force was concentrated against enemy communications and on military targets in the battle area, A number ofbridges were successfully attacked, a culvert south of Parma destroyed, railway lines cut in many places, especially in the Bologna/Ferrara areas, and severalstations hit; the railway centres at Ravenna and Faenza were attacked by medium bombers. Locks on the River Aclige, shipping on the River Po and maritimetargets on the coasts were effectively attacked.
