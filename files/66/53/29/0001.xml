IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS&apos; BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET&quot;7. P. (UU)  U29. (&apos;REVISB) - COPY NO.3RD AUGUST,   \9hh,WAR CABINETVICEROY&apos;&apos;Sf : NO . :OSB,- -REPLY To GANDHI -Report by the India CommitteeThe Coiranittee has considered the draft reply to Mr. Gandhiproposed j.n the Viceroy *s telegram of 1st August,  19kk9(11+93. S.) printed as Appendix IV to W. P* (kk) k3&amp;.They recornraend the following redraft of paragraphs to 5 of that telegram;-&quot;3&apos;      Without recapitulating all these reasons indetail I should remind you that H.M.G.  at that timemade it clear  (a)  that their offer of complete and -unqualified freedom after the cessation of hostilitieswas conditional upon the framing of a Constitutionagreed &quot;by the main elements of India&apos;s national life and the negotiation of the necessary treaty arrangements with H.M.G.   (b)  that it was impossible during the periodof hostilities to bring about any change in theConstitution by which means alone a &quot;national government&quot;such as you suggest could be male responsible to theCentral Assembly.h.      It was upon the above conditions, that H.M.G.   invited the Indian leaders to take part in an interim government,which would operate under the existing Constitution,must make it quite clear that utfltil the war is over  hie   --.  responsibility for defence and military operations cannotbe divided out from the other responsibilities of theGovernment and that until hostilities cease and the newConstitution is in operation, H.m. G. and the governor general must retain their responsibility over the entirefield.      So far as the&quot; question of India 5 s share of thecost of the war is concerned, this is essentially amatter for settlement between H.-M..G.  on the one hand andthe Government of India on the ether, and existing-arrangement s can only be reopene 1 at the instance of oneor other of those governments.5.      Your present proposal is consequently not one whichI could recommend for the acceptance of H.M.G.      Thereis therefore no purpose in our meeting for discussion onthat basis.      At the same time IMM.G.  are most anxious that a settlement of the Indian problem should bereadied.      The war is&apos; now moving fast towards a victoriousconclusion and unless agreement can be reached on linessatisfactory to all parties India can hardly play herproper part in the post-war settlement or throw herundistracted energies after the war into plans for economic   aid social development.&quot;

6,     If the leaders of Hindus, Moslems and theimportant minorities were willing to co-operate in a transitional government established and working within the present constitution, I believewe could make progress. For such a transitionalgovernment to succeed there must, before it is formed, be agreement in principle between Hindusand Moslems and the important minorities as to themethod by which the new Constitution should be framed.     This agreement is a matter for Indiansthemselves.      I should be glad to help them to achieve it if I thought I could do anything tohelp.      But I doubt if I can do anything untilthe Indian leaders have come closer together thanthey are now, and I welcome meetings between themsuch as that which is shortly co take place betweenyou and Mr.  Jinnah.  .   I beg you to remember thatminority problems are not easy.      They exist in many countries and have caused much unhappiness andeven civil war.      It is a mis trice to say thatminority problems in India have been c reated bythe British;    they are real and con be solved only by mutual compromise and generosity,7.      The period after the termination of hostilitiesfor which the transitional Government would lastwould depend on the speed with which the newConstitution could be framed,      I see no reason whypreliminary work on that Constitution should notbegin as soon as the Indian Leaders are prepared.toco-operate to that end.        If they can arrive at a genuine agreement as to the.method of framing theConstitution, the time taken after the war for coming to final conclusions and for agreeing the necessarytreaty arrangements with H.M. G. need not be very long.&quot;The Committee are of opinion that to keep the initiative in our hands this correspondence should be released as soon aMr. Gandhi has received the Viceroy&apos;s reply.      They recommendthat the Viceroy should be so informed and asked to make itclear to Mr. Gandhi in whatever way he thinks fit, that immediate publication is proposed.C . x i*Privy Council Office, S.w.1.3rd august, 19h!u
