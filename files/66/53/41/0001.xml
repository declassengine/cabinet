THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 441.12th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.INDIA.Viceroy&apos;s Proposed Reply to Gandhi.I attach for the information of my colleagues copies of telegrams receivedfrom the Viceroy (Appendices I and II), in reply to my telegram No. 17258 datedthe 5th August containing the Cabinet&apos;s redraft of the reply to Gandhi, and alsocopies of telegrams despatched to him (Appendices III and IV) on the11th August after his redraft had been considered by the India Committee.L. S. A.India Office, 12th August, 1944.APPENDIX I.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated IWh August.(No. 1546-S.)1. Owing to difficulties of communication, due to my absence in Manipurand Assam, I have only on my return to-day been able to compare your revised draft and my original one.2. There is no difference in principle and object between the two drafts, butI do consider there is vital difference in form and part matter. Indians are most,sensitive to tone of communications, and His Majesty&apos;s Governments revised draft will undoubtedly be considered as hostile and provocative and will increasebitterness in feeling of all political Indians. It will also, I think, be bad in effecton opinion in the United States and elsewhere.3. I therefore submit in succeeding telegram revised draft with which Ipropose to reply to Gandhi&apos;s letter. It embodies some of the amendments in HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s draft but omits reference to financial settlement, whichI considered it unnecessary to raise at this stage, and paragraph No. 3 and first sentence of paragraph No. 4 of Cabinet draft, which would only lead to uselesscontroversy on legal lines. Jinnah is almost certain to (? take) with Gandhi inany case the points which His Majesty&apos;s Government have in mind.4. I am assuming that His Majesty&apos;s Government are sincere in their wishes to make progress toward political settlement. I can assure them that it is myconsidered opinion that their proposed reply will do&quot; more harm than good. Ican also assure them that I am fully alive to Gandhi&apos;s past record and presentobjectives, and have no intention of entering into negotiation with him on his present basis. At the same time there is some possibility in present mood ofpolitical India of making progress towards solution of deadlock, and I thinkHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be unwise to do anything likely to destroy thathope, however faint, by being too uncompromising in their attitude.[27992]
5 My proposed reply was drawn up in consultation with my Home Depart-ment and Reforms Commissioner (an Indian), who have no reason to trust Gancmior Congress but are in touch with the feeling here. I think you must be preparedto accept advice of the man on the spot in this matter, and trust that my reply,which gives away nothing in principle, will be approved.APPENDIX II.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 10th August.(No. 1547-S.) . ,   p     pMy immediately preceding telegram.   Following is suggested redraft olreply to Gandhi.   Begins : 1.   Thank you for your letter of 27th July.   Your proposal is-(i) That you should undertake to advise the Working Committee (a) &quot; thatin view of changed conditions mass civil disobedience envisaged by theresolution of August&apos; 1942 cannot be offered,&quot; and (b) &quot; that full co-operation in war effort should be given by Congress,&quot; provided (ii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should (a) declare immediate Indianindependence, and (&amp;) form a &quot; National Government&quot; responsible to Central Assembly, &quot; subject to proviso that, during pendency of war,military operations should continue as at present but without involving any financial burden on India.&quot;2. Since your letter was written you must have studied statement made byMr. Amery in the House of Commons on 28th July, and will know that thisproposal is not acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government as a basis for discussion.It is very similar to proposal made by Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad toSir Stafford Cripps in April 1942, and His Majesty7&apos;s Government^ reasons for rejecting it are the same as they7 were then.3. Although His Majesty7&apos;s Government cannot accept your present proposal,and we could make no progress if we met in order to discuss it, I must assure you that they are most anxious for a settlement of the Indian problem. I do not wishto prejudge any7 proposals that may7 later be made to me, but if the leaders of the hindus, Moslems, Depressed Classes and other important minorities were willingto co-operate in a transitional Government established and working within thepresent constitution I believe good progress could be made. It is quite clear that until the war is over responsibility for defence and military operations cannot be divided from the other responsibilities of the Government, and that until the newconstitution is in operation His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governor-Generalmust retain their responsibility over the entire field. It is obvious that for a transitional Government to succeed there must, before it is formed, be agreement in principle between Hindus and Moslems and all other important elements asto the method by7 which the new constitution should be framed. This agreement is a matter for Indian leaders themselves and I doubt if I can do anything to help them to secure it until they have come closer together than they7 are now. Minorityproblems are not easy and can be solved only by mutual compromise and tolerance.4. The period after the termination of hostilities for which the transitionalGovernment would last would depend upon the speed with which the new constitu-tion could be framed. I see no reason why preliminary7 work on the newconstitution should not begin as soon as Indian leaders are prepared to co-operate to that end. If they can arrive now at a genuine agreement as to the method of framing the new7 constitution as suggested above I see no reason why any very long time need be spent after the war in reaching final conclusions and in negotia-ting a treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government.5. You and Mr. Jinnah have my good wishes for your approachino-discussion. Ends.Note. For convenience of reference the text of the Viceroy&apos;s redraft is reproduced in full.
APPENDIX III.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, dated 11th August.Private (No. 17796).Your 1546-S. and 1547-S. about suggested redraft of reply to Gandhi.The draft approved and contained in my 17258 of the 5th August was theresult of prolonged consideration by a meeting of the War Cabinet presided overby the Prime Minister. Several other Ministers who attended the meeting, and held strong views on the matter, are not now available for immediate consultation.India Committee and the Ministers available have given fullest considerationto the views set out in your telegram 1546-S. But until the full War Cabinet canbe reassembled, which cannot be for several days, it is clearly impracticable to reconsider the draft then approved.If, therefore, you still feel strong objection to the draft contained in 17258,the only alternative appears to be that you should send a very short reply in theterms suggested in my immediately following telegram. I am proposing &quot;to make this suggestion to the War Cabinet at their meeting on Monday, but I am sendingyou this at once in order that you may know the position.APPENDIX IV.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 11th August.(No. 17797.)Following is text of redraft referred to in my immediately preceding telegram.   Begins:Thank you for your letter of 27th July. In my letter to you of 22nd July Istated that if you would submit to me a definite and constructive policy I shouldbe glad to consider it.Braving regard to the definite statements already made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of their policy to which they adhere, I cannot regard the proposals put forward in your letter of the 27th July as satisfying this condition.   Ends.
