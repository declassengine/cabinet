THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.W.P. (44) 445.15th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY IN WESTERN EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.Mr. DUFF COOPER&apos;S despatch of the 13th June and the foreign secretary&apos;s reply of the 25th July (W.P. (44) 409) seem to me to constitutebetween them by far the most realistic and searching approach to our futureEuropean policy. Both assume the desirability or, indeed, necessity for some close alliance between ourselves and the Western European democracies, whether asa supplement to a World Organisation based on the continuing co-operation ofthe United States and Russia with ourselves, or as an alternative in the event ofthat co-operation ceasing to be effective or even breaking down entirely. Wherethey differ is in their estimate of probabilities as regards RussiaV future policy,as to the policy we should adopt towards Poland in relation to Russia, as wellalso as to the closeness of the union which we can establish with the Westerndemocracies.Whether Russia is likely to become restlessly aggressive and a menace to world peace in the future is entirely a matter of conjecture. What is certain isthat she is only going to co-operate, even to a very moderate extent, with us and america on her own terms. Those terms will include something in the nature ofa protectorate or at any rate sphere of influence over her western neighbours.The Secretary of State is, therefore, in my opinion, absolutly right in rejectingany idea that a powerful Poland can, with our support, be relied upon to keepRussia and Germany apart, Where, precisely, the western boundary of Russianpredominance will eventually be drawn depends mainly on geography, but such other considerations as race and ideological sympathies will come into the picture.The frontier, indeed, may, from internal causes in the countries concerned, be ashifting one and it is in this connection that the greatest danger of antagonismbetween Europe and Russia may arise and might involve us.As things stand at present the Russian sphere will certainly include poland and Czechoslovakia, possibly Hungary and most of the Balkans, though localnationalism and peasant individualism may both react away from Russia sooner or later. The real problem remains Germany. Nothing could be more dangerousthan for Germany to become what the Foreign Secretary calls a no man&apos;s land,a temptation to Russian ambition and a source of quarrel between Russia and ourselves.That brings me to a contingency which has not so far been discussed, exceptin a very limited way when Mr. Duff Cooper suggests that the Rhinelandmay be included in our Western Europe. Will there in fact be a, Germany ? Itmay be that even this second defeat will only intensify the Prusso-German Naziideal and that nothing except a generation of holding down by her neighbourswill prevent a third outburst of aggressive fanaticism. But there are other possibilities.Germany, as a national entity, is a recent and highly artificial affair, heldtogether much more by the Prussian tradition of military aggrandisement whichwe hope now to be finally discredited, than by a deeper unity of race, history or social structure. The German-speaking peoples, indeed, may be said to fall into three broad historic sections. There is, first of all, the Germany of the old Romanworld, i.e., the Germany west and south of the Rhine and of the old boundarywall which ran from the Main to the Danube-roughly speaking, the Rhineland,[28002]SECRET.

the South German States and Austria. This Germany, small-holding,individualistic. Catholic, is essentially in spirit part of Western Europe. Oneportion of it, Alsace-Lorraine, has ever since the French Revolution adheredpassionately to the Western outlook on life, regardless of its German speech.There is, secondly, the Middle Germany, the region between the Rhine and theElbe, essentially German by race, which, though outside the old Roman Empire,was gradually Christianised and effectively included in the new Roman Empireof Charlemagne and of the Germanic Holy Roman Empire which succeeded it.This, too, is largely, though not entirely, a land of peasant proprietors, but to amuch greater extent industrialised and predominantly Protestant. The thirdGermany, that east of the Elbe, is the result of German conquest, colonisationand assimilation of the original Slav population. Fifty years ago a large districtquite close to Berlin still spoke Wendish, i.e., Slovene. This is a land of largeestates, of a territorial aristocracy which has never quite cast oft&apos; the Herrenvolkmentality towards workmen who subconsciously resent an alien overlorclship.Here, far more than in the other two Germanics, is a population naturallyl^redisposed towards Communism.It is at least conceivable and we should therefore not lose the possibilityout of sight that in the event of a general collapse Germany might, of itself,tend to break up along one or other of these lines of cleavage, and that thetendency might easily be reinforced by the actual course of hostilities. supposing that Russia, when she gets to Berlin, sets up a German National Council of liberation, will Western and Southern Germany accept its authority? Will we and the Americans either insist on their doing so. or make Russia desist and agree to the supersession of her protege by an avowedly anti-Bolshevik Germanregime? Have we. in that event, any real alternative to accepting the situationand including whatever part of.Germany would sooner not be Sovietised in ourown sphere of influence ? Ought we not also, if we have to come to such a decision,try to make sure of the Elbe rather than the Rhine as our provisional boundary?I say -provisional, for it may be that by an internal reaction against Russianhegemony and Russian ideology all Europe west of the Curzon Line might eventually come together in a European Union in which the Germany orGermanies of that date might play their useful part as a defensive element againsta Russia menacing not only Europe but also our position in the Middle Eastand in India. That situation is, perhaps, too hypothetical and remote for us nowto decide our attitude towards it.Assuming, then, that it will be our policy to build up a defensive system withsuch Western Europe as we can get together, or rather as will get itself together,what should be our relation to it ? I entirely agree with Mr. Duff Cooper inlooking to France as the natural nucleus and main bastion of the system. Onthe whole she is likely to have suffered less than her neighbours. Her actualarea and variety of natural resources are greater than that of any Europeancountry west of Russia. Her population was once greater than that of Germanyand three times ours. Intensive economic development, the stimulation of familylife and immigration might make a great difference in the next fifty years. she has the largest colonial Empire in the world which, as Mr. Duff Cooper pointsout, has loyally stood by her. Her position on both shores of the Mediterraneanis hardly less important to us than her position as Germany&apos;s neighbour. Wemust keep friends with France.On the other hand it seems to me that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s criticisms of Mr. Duff Cooper&apos;s suggestion of direct political and economic union between ourselves and Western Europe are conclusive. Norway and Iceland, conceivablyeven Denmark and Sweden, might be willing to join the British commonwealth and be welcomed into the partnership. The others, even if their national pridewould tolerate it, are too different in their outlook and economic interests from us to merge into any single politico-economic system. Mr. Duff Cooper stipulatesthat we should only include &quot;democracies.&quot; But what precisely is democracyand by what test should we exclude a member of the Alliance if it began changingits constitution? Could we reconcile Free Trade with Western Europe withour schemes for planned employment ? Or would the French give up their rightto give effective economic preference to their colonies? Above all, by whatpossible constitutional machinery could we get the whole group with&apos;all itsdifferent mentalities to act in effective unison ?The impossibility of such a conception of complete unity need not, however,forbid a considerable measure of effective and indeed intimate co-operation. i see no reason why the nations of the Western European system should not supple-ment a long-term defensive alliance by mutual tariff preferences, by effective air,
rail and river transport co-operation, by a common currency system. Nor is it essential that we, whose position as a Commonwealth differentiates us in so many respects, should make identical arrangements with them in every respect. we might, for instance, over and above our defensive alliance with them, join intheir transport convention without necessarily being included in their customspreferences or including them in ours. They might find it convenient to includesterling assets in the reserve of their currency system without actually joining the Sterling Area. In all these matters we can only proceed tentatively, alwayskeeping in mind, on the one hand, the closer natural affinity, defensive, economicand mental, of the European countries with each other than with us and thepossibility of the post-war Western European system ultimately expanding toinclude countries not originally part of it, and, on the other, our own affinitiesand responsibilities over a much wider field. It may well be that twenty orthirty years hence Asia, not Europe, will be the world&apos;s storm centre and thechief preoccupation of those who will be concerned with world peace. We mustkeep our hands reasonably free for that eventuality.L. S. A.12th August, 1944.
