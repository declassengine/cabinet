THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.secret:W.P. j(44) 406.24th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.FUTURE WORLD ORGANISATION.Report by the Armistice and Post-War Committee.THE War Cabinet at their meeting^ on the 7th July invited the armistice and Post-War Committee to consider the points on which alternative solutionswere set out in Memoranda A and B on World Organisation which were appended to W.P. (44) 370 and Memoranda C, D and E appended to W.P. (44) 220, andto make recommendations to the War Cabinet upon them.2. The various points on which our delegation will require guidance are set out in a Memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (A.P.W. (44) 45), a copy ofwhich is annexed. The Armistice - and Post-War Committee considered thisMemorandum and their recommendations are set out below. References are to paragraphs in the Memorandum.Size of the Council (paragraph 2).3. After careful review of the arguments on both sides we support theproposal of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that our Delegation inthe forthcoming conversations in Washington should aim at a Council of notfewer than 9 and not more than 12 members.Method by which the Council reaches decisions and questions of the status ofthe Great Powers in this respect (paragraphs 3-8).4. The more important decisions of principle by the Council are likely tobe of two kinds (a) for the settlement of non-justiciable disputes;(&amp;) for the application of powers to maintain or restore peace or security.We agree that the principle of a two-thirds majority should, as suggestedby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, be adopted in regard to the secondcategory. But, after full consideration of the arguments on either side, weare of the opinion that there is not sufficient justification for &apos;a distinctionbetween the procedure for dealing with cases falling in category (a) and casesfalling in category (b). We recommend accordingly that our Delegation be instructed to advocate the principle of a two-thirds majority of the Council,which must include all the Great Powers, for. cases in both these categories. we take note, in this connection, that it is proposed to treat China&apos;as a Great power for the purpose of the World Organisation.Abstention by a Great Power (paragraph 9).5. We recommend, in the light of the views of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, that our Delegation be instructed to oppose provision (if anysiich provision is proposed) to enable a Great Power to have the right to abstain from voting on the Council and so to free itself from the responsibility for theCouncil&apos;s decision or for action recommended by it.Question of Withdrawal of States from the World Organisation (paragraphs 10and 11).6. We are unanimously of the opinion that our representatives atWashington should be instructed to aim at a permanent organisation from whichthere should be no right of withdrawal.* W.M. (44) SSfch Conclusions, Minute 4.[27874] ,        bVCopy No.
Relation of  the    World Council  to  the Military Staff  Committee  (para-graphs 12-14).7. For many years to come the Four Powers will have to play the predominant part in safeguarding world peace. We therefore agree with theForeign Secretary&apos;s recommendation, which was also that of the Chiefs of Staff,that the permanent members of the Military Staff Committee should be therepresentatives of those Four Powers. Other&apos;States should be represented only when they have a special interest in the problems to be discussed.8. It is possible that the demand for machinery which will ensure rapid and effective action in the event of a sudden challenge to the Organisation is so great that the smaller States might accept a Defence Committee of the Councilcomposed of the Great Powers, as suggested by the Foreign Secretary. We agreethat the Delegation should discuss the whole question with the United States and soviet representatives and ascertain their views, and thereafter refer back for instructions in the light of them.Regional Associations (paragraphs 15-17).9. We were informed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that hewould prefer to postpone the framing of concrete proposals so far as a regionalassociation for the Western European or Atlantic area is concerned until theresult of a reference which has been made to the Chiefs of Staff is available to him:We accordingly make no recommendation on this point.10. As regards the possibility of a United Nations Commission for Europe,we recommend that our representatives at Washington should be instructed toexplain, if interrogated on the subject by their Soviet or American colleagues (a) That the United Nations Commission for Europe would be designedprimarily as part of the machinery necessary for clearing up the warand would not necessarily form part of the eventual world machineryfor maintaining peace;(b) That, in particular, it was clear that major political disputes in europe should be referred to the World Council if it is established and not toa United Nations Commission for Europe.Location of the World Organisation (paragraph 18).11.   We agree with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that (a) in principle we should contemplate a permanent headquarters for the secretariat;(b) it seems essential that the Council should have a permanent seat wheremeetings would normally be held, although provision might be made that it could, if necessary, meet elsewhere. We agree also that thesuggestion of a peripatetic Assembly involves even greater difficultiesthan for a peripatetic Council.(c) our representatives at Washington should bear in mind our conclusions in (a) and (b) above, but that they should avoid, if possible, a discus-sion on the actual location of the organisation, and that this difficult matter had better be left to a later stage when there is a measure ofagreement on questions of principle.Timing of establishment of World Organisation (paragraph 19).12. We recommend that our Delegation should press for the establishmentof a World Organisation before the peace settlement and should resist any dis-position to postpone participation in it until a satisfactory peace settlement hasbeen concluded.C. R. A., Chairman(on behalf of the Committee).Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.24:th July, 1944.
6 6ANNEX.[A.P.W. (44) 45.]WAR CABINET.Armistice and Post-Y/ar Committee.EUTURE WORLD ORGANISATION.Points for Decision.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The broad policy of His Majesty1s Government concerning Future world organisation has been laid down in the memoranda* to be circulated to theUnited States and Soviet Governments, which have now been considered and approved by the War Cabinet. There are, however, a number of supplementarypoints on which I should like to have advice before the Delegation goes to washington.Size of the Council.2. This question has been left open in Memorandum A. But it will certainly be discussed and may well affect decisions on other points. The Russians havenot yet shown their hand, but it is possible that they will press for a Great PowerCouncil with no representatives of the smaller Powers. The United StatesGovernment, for their part, may wish to keep the number of small States down to four. I myself feel that a Four-Power Council would not be a practicable solutionand that a Council comprising, in addition to the Great Powers, four representa-tives of the smaller Powers (who would probably be elected by the Assembly)might provide insufficient representation of the latter. If France be given apermanent seat among the Great Powers, as I hope she eventually will be, there might be 6 or 7 seats allotted to the smaller States, making a Council of 11 or 12.My own experience goes to show that this is not too large for convenience, while there are great advantages in associating a sufficient number of States to ensurerepresentation of diverse interests and different continents. We must also try to secure a seat for the Dominions. At the same time we do not wish the Councilto be as large as it was in 1934-35, when the number grew to 16, and it may notbe convenient to start with so large a number as 12 until we see how the differentStates shape up after the war. I suggest, therefore, that our delegation should aim at a number not smaller than 9 and not larger than 12.Method by which the Council reaches decisions and question of special status ofthe Great Powers in this respect.3. On questions of procedure, it has been suggested in paragraph 12 of memorandum B that a majority vote of the Council shall suffice, and there doesnot seem to be any strong reason why the votes of the Great Powers should enjoyany special status in this regard.4. The more important decisions of principle by the Council may be oftwo kinds : (a) For the settlement of non-justiciable disputes, and(b) For the application of force to maintain or restore peace and security.5. As regards (a), neither we nor any other State would agree that states should be obliged to accept and carry out such decisions against their will (seeMemorandum B, paragraph 14). This would mean something like the immediatecreation of a super-State. None the less, decisions of the Council for thesettlement of disputes would carry very great weight, and should, I suggest,enable a State which accepted them to count on the full support of the Council* W.P. (44) 370 for Memoranda A and B.P.M.M. (44) 4 for Memoranda 0, D and E.T27874] b 2
if attacked. My own feeling, therefore, is that they should only be made by the unanimous vote of all the members of the Council who are not parties to thedispute. A unanimous decision would carry more moral weight than, say, a two-thirds majority, even though all the Great Powers not parties to the disputewere included in it. We did not find while we were a member of the Leaguethat there was any inconvenience in the unanimity rule which outweighed thedecided advantages of the moral weight resulting from it. I suggest, therefore,that our Delegation be instructed in this sense.6. As regards class (b) decisions by the Council for the application of force to maintain or restore peace and security the situation is somewhat different. Here it is on the Great Powers that the responsibility of carrying outthe decision will mainly fall, and such a decision should therefore (except as provided in paragraph 7 below) always include their votes. But there is muchto be said for the principle that in decisions involving the application of force should not be within the power of individual smaller States to prevent coerciveaction against disturbers of the peace to whom they may be united by specialties. Accordingly it is arguable that a two-thirds majority of the Council,including all the Great Powers, should suffice for such decisions, and I would suggest that our delegation be empowered to adopt this line.7. If coercive action were directed against one of the Great Powers, thelatter&apos;s vote would not of course count among those necessary for the requisitemajority. In such a case the World Organisation would become to all intentsand purposes an alliance against the dissident Great Power, and the stage wouldbe set for a major war. it will of course be one of the main purposes of theOrganisation to prevent such a situation occurring. If it ever does, we shallhave failed, and there is little use in speculating what the resulting situation would be.8. There is one general difficulty in the above system. Owing to theattitude of the -United States we have had to admit China as one of the great powers. &apos; She will thus theoretically have the same position as the other three.In practice, however, I feel confident that for a long period China will be sodependent on the other Great Powers that she will not be likely to pursue anyvery independent policy of her own in matters affecting international peace and security.Abstention by a Great power .9. There is some reason to believe that the United States Government maysurest that in certain cases a Great Power should have the rigvht to abstain from voting on the Council, and thus free itself from responsibility while allowingother States more immediately interested to take such action as they desire. i feel that such an &quot;escape clause&quot; is altogether against the spirit and letterof our Memoranda, which insist that each State shall assist in the maintenanceof peace and security, due regard being paid to its resources, geographicalpositions, &amp;c. I suggest, therefore, that the Delegation be instructed to oppose the insertion of any such clause if it is proposed.The question of tuithdrazval.10. Another point that may arise is whether States shall be allowed towithdraw from the Organisation, after due notice, if they so wish. There ismuch to be said for endeavouring from the outset to make the Organisationpermanent. It is on the assumption that such an Organisation will exist thatthe whole peace settlement will be worked out. On the other hand, it is probablethat States would be unwilling to forego in advance the right to withdraw froman association freely entered upon, and it is arguable that an unwilling memberof the Organisation might do more harm than good. Moreover, we may wish toamend the constitution of the Organisation, and it seems especially difficult to lay down that States must be bound to remain members of an Organisation whose -constitution was changed in a manner of which they did not approve.11. Nevertheless, if it should appear in the Washington conversations thatthe other Powers, and more especially the United States, are prepared to contemplate a permanent organisation with no right of withdrawal there wouldseem to be considerable advantage in accepting this. Needless to say, if one ofthe three Great Powers should break its obligations and leave the organisation  new situation would obviously be created in which all other States should havethe right to reconsider their position.
Relation of the Council to the Military Staff Committee.12. This is one of the most important features of the whole scheme, bywhich we may hope to build up a really workable system to maintain peace and security and. especially to keep Germany and Japan from again challenging theworld. The Military Staff Committee is to advise the Committee on the technicalside, but decisions for translating its advice into action must, of course, be takenby the representatives of Governments on the Council. Should these decisionsbe made directly by the whole Council; or should the Great Powers form a sort of Defence Committee of the Council, whose normal function would be torecommend measures to the main body but which would possess the right to actimmediately if such action were necessary to maintain peace and security?13. There is also the question whether all the States on the Council shallhave the right of being represented on the Military Staff Committee. This wouldmean that a number of the representatives would be constantly changing.14. I am inclined to think that only the Great Powers should have represen-tation on the Military Staff Committee as a right, and that other States, whethermembers of the Council or not, should be represented only when they have aspecial interest in the problems to be discussed. If this procedure be adopted the question of a Defence Committee of the Great Powers may assume less importance, since these matters will be primarily in their hands through their special position on the Military Staff Committee. On the other hand, it is possiblethat the demand for machinery which will ensure rapid and effective action inthe event of a sudden challenge to the Organisation is so great that the smallerStates might accept the Defence Committee if it were thought wise to create it.I suggest that the Delegation discuss the whole question with the United Statesand Soviet representatives, discover their views and refer back for instuctions in the light of them.Regional A ssociations.15. It was made clear at the Conference of the Dominion Prime ministers that the general view was that regional political bodies should be entirelysubordinate to the World Organisation, and that they were not suitable for thesettlement of important disputes. I agree with this view; but it was alsoadmitted, I think, that regional defence associations might perform a very usefulrole within the framework of a general world organisation.16. I have considered for some time whether there should be some suchregional association for the Western European or Atlantic area. A paper onthe subject is under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff, and on receipt of theirviews I propose to make some concrete proposals to the Committee covering themost important points. I think, however, that we need not press for referenceto this subject in any draft declaration which the discussions may produce if that would be likely to add to the difficulty of reaching agreement.17. Paragraph 18 of Memorandum A introduces the possibility of some&quot; United Nations Commission for Europe.&quot; Such a Commission, if it were everestablished, would obviously be a projection into the peace of the european advisory Commission, and there is no doubt to my mind that it could play a very useful role. Apart from anything else, it might, within the sphere indicated inmy Memorandum of the 1st July, 1943, tend to reinforce the Anglo-Soviet treaty as a kind of bridge between Eastern and Western Europe. But it would of courseprimarily be designed as part of the machinery necessary for clearing up the warand would not necessarily form part of the eventual world machinery for main-taining peace. In particular, it is clear that major political disputes in europe should be referred to the World: Council (if it is established) and not to a &quot; united nations Commission for Europe.&quot; I should accordingly like authority for the delegation to put forward explanations on these lines if they are interrogated onthe subject by their Soviet and American colleagues.A fixed place for the Organisation,   (See A.P.W. (44) 11.)18. We have left open in our Memoranda the question where the Organisa-tion should be located. But we have assumed that it would be somewhere, andthis appeared to be the view of Mr. Stettinius and his advisers. On the otherhand, there is some reason to suppose that the President would favour a sort ofperipatetic Council and Assembly.   The Delegation ought, it is suggested, to be
assured before departure that it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthe Organisation should be established in some definite place, in other words, thatthe Secretariat at least should have a permanent home. It also seems essentialthat the Council should have a permanent seat where meetings would be normallyheld, though it might be provided that, if necessary, it could meet elsewhere.The suggestion of a peripatetic Assembly presents even more difficulties thanthat of a peripatetic Council. The Delegation should. I suggest, be instructedto adopt this line. It is in any case most desirable to avoid, if possible, discussion on the actual location of the Organisation. Discussion on this thorny point had better be left to a later stage when there is a measure of agreement of questionsof principle.Time.19. It appears from reports of Mr. Hull&apos;s discussions with the specialnon-party Sub-Committee of the Senate which has been considering these matters that there is a fairly considerable section of opinion in the United States which,while favouring in principle Amerioan participation in a World Organisation,considers that a previous condition of such participation ought to be the attain-ment of a satisfactory peace settlement. Against this it is argued writh forcethat such a settlement is itself among the most vital tasks of a World Organisa-tion and that it is imperative, both from a general point, of view and from thatof securing American participation during the present co-operative stage of ourrelations, to press for the establishment of a World Organisation before the peace settlement. I suggest that the Delegation^ instructions should contain a clauseto this effect.Foreign Office, 17 th July, 1944.(Initialled) A. E. !
