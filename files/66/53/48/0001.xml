BRITISH REQUIREMENTS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THEEUROPEAN WAR.1. His Majesty&apos;s Government have been considering what assistance theywill need from Canada and the United States after the end of the German War,to enable them to play their full part in the war against Japan. In assessingtheir needs they have found it necessary to take stock of their general economicand financial situation. The result of that examination is to show that we shallstand in need of assistance on Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid terms during Stage II(by which we mean the period between the German Armistice and the final end ofhostilities) within the full present scope and on the following scale : (a) Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid for munitions in the proportion which our war effort in Stage II bears to that in Stage I; on the basis of present plans this would represent approximately $4 billions in the first year from the United States and $1-2 billions* from Canada;(b) Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid for food-stuffs, raw materials, oil, shipping and non-munitions sufficient to meet the reasonable needs in these respects of the United Kingdom for supplies from North Americansources, to a value of approximately $3 billions from the UnitedStates and $1 billion* from Canada.2. We propose to show in some detail how these conclusions are reached,that these supplies are essential to our military effort in Stage II, and that theyare therefore as necessary to the defence of the United States and Canada as when our military effort was predominantly directed against Germany.I. Introductory.3. The people of the United Kingdom have been at war for nearly fiveyears. The effects on our economy have been very grave. Internally, our industrial capital has greatly deteriorated; we have suffered much damage,especially in housing, from enemy action; the population have been living underincreasing shortage of all but &quot;the bare necessities of life. Externally, we haverestricted our exports, retaining only those necessary for the prosecution of thewar; we have dissipated the accumulated savings of a century, and have turnedfrom a creditor nation to a debtor nation on a large scale.II. Internal Economic Conditions.4. (a) Mobilisation of Man-potver. Over 65 per cent, of the occupiedpopulation of Great Britain is now engaged in Government work; of these some45 per cent, are in the Forces, full-time Civil Defence or directly employed in theproduction of munitions; the remaining 20 per cent, are providing other non-munition goods to meet the needs of our own Forces or of our Dominions andAllies from the United Kingdom, or are engaged in constructional work on militarybuildings, airfields and other defence projects, or are maintaining Servicesindispensable to the use of the United Kingdom as a base for European opera-tions; of the remaining 35 per cent., only some 2 per cent, are directly engagedin manufacture for export; the margin of 33 per cent., available to meet theminimum needs of the civilian population, is now barely sufficient. The increasein the man-power serving the Government has been progressive, but already by mid-1941 it was close to 55 per cent, and by mid-1942 it was 62 per cent., so thatfor more than three years we have now lived under a very high degree ofmobilisation, and a severe curtailment of all civil supplies..* These figures are the estimated total supplies required from Canada, and before deduction of countervailing credits.[27910] &apos;     b
5. &apos;(b) Industrial Equipment. Industry and essential services have beenstarved of labour and materials for maintaining their standards of equipment.The transport and power systems in particular have been carrying greatlyincreased loads with a greatly reduced flow of materials and new equipment. a wide range of industry has been closed down altogether, and considerable workwill have to be done before it can again operate efficiently. We cannot continueto live on our internal capital indefinitely; during the Japanese War it will benecessary for us to fill the most serious deficiencies in our industrial maintenance.6. ^(c) Housing and Durable Consumption Goods. In housing, clothing and household goods the shortages have now become so serious that we shall soon be compelled to devote considerable resources to redress them. We have lost fouryears&apos; normal house-building and two years&apos; normal house repair; even before the flying-bomb attacks began, one-fourth of our houses had been destroyed or damaged by enemy action and less than one-half of these had been completely repaired. Itwill take us some years even to restore our pre-war standards of housing; in themeantime, we face conditions of acute shortage. In five years of war the populationhave been able to buy only three years&apos; normal supply of clothing and two years&apos;supply of household goods. The current supply of manufactured goods to civilians is at one-half of pre-war levels and as the war proceeds the backlogsaccumulate. Resources must, therefore, be devoted after the European war to restore the elementary requirements of clothing and household goods.7. (d) Food. The food supply in the last four years has been enough butonly just enough to sustain health and strength on a monotonous diet. the fifteenth Report to Congress on Lend-Lease Operations describes the presentposition &quot; Even with the help of Lend-Lease goods, however, this result to have enough to eat to sustain an intensive war effort has been attained only byvery strict rationing. The British people eat far less well than the people ofthe United States. Compared to the average American civilian, the averageBritisher in 1943 was able to obtain only 76 per cent, as much milk and milk products, 76 per cent, as much meat, 68 per cent, as much poultry&apos; and fish,56 per cent, as many eggs (and in Britain&apos;s case these were almost entirelydried eggs), 23 per cent, as much citrus fruit and tomatoes, and 50 per cent, asmuch other fruit and fruit products. The only important foods the Britishcivilian gets more of than the American civilian are potatoes, such vegetablesas carrots and cabbage, and bread.&quot;8. The effects of the war upon our civilian standards of life are set out inmore detail in Annex 4. In Stage II, Britain lays no claim to luxuries. On theother hand we regard it as imperative that the scale of our war effort, and the planning of the aid that we may receive from our Allies, shall take account of thenecessity to make greater provision than we thought justified at the crisis of thewar for the longer-term maintenance of our civil economy, and for the needs of thecivil population.III. The Effects of War on Britain&apos;s External Economic Position.9. The Contraction of the Export Trades. The whole lay-out of the british war economy was dominated during the formative period by one supremeconsideration : Britain was alone in the war, and alone capable of bringingmilitary weapons to bear upon the enemy. By the sale of the foreign assets that had been accumulated over a century, we could call for aid upon the industrialeffort of nations which still remained neutral. It was wise and it was necessarythat the British military effort should be inflated far beyond any level that couldbe maintained by our own unaided industrial efforts, even (which then was farfrom the case) when they reached full fruition.10. In the first weeks of the war, the extent of the British foreign assets andthe current rate at which they were being dispersed were surveyed. It was immediately decided that measures were necessary to conserve them, not only bydrastic limitation of less essential imports, but also by an export drive.11. Before the war there had been about 1,750,000 persons engaged in theproduction of British exports about 1,300,000 were in actual mining and
manufacture, and about 450,000 of those in transport, distribution and other occupations were performing services ancillary to export. At mid-1940 thesefigures had been appreciablv reduced, but the total engaged in direct export was still in excess of 1,000,000.12. The supersession of Cash and Carry by Lend-Lease in the spring of1941 was the chief cause of an immense change between mid-1940 and mid-1942.By the latter date, only some 440,000 were still engaged in mining or manufacturefor export, and by mid-1944 there were only about 300,000 so engaged. Thus theeffect of Lend-Lease, together with other similar aid from Empire countries, thedisposal of British assets and the accumulation of London balances, has been tomake possible the transfer to the war effort of some 1,400,000 former workers inthe export industries.13. These measures enabled the United Kingdom very greatly to increasethe impact upon Germany at a critical phase of the war. But the transfer fromexport to munitions was only possible because we were enabled, through Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid, to receive a great quantity of imports without corres-ponding exports; and our economy is now organised on that basis. The processtook time to establish, and will take time to reverse. The result is that we arenot, and cannot be for some considerable time to come, in a position to pay forour minimum and inescapable import needs.14. The Balance of Payments. We have attempted to estimate the probableBritish balances of payments during Stage II and the subsequent transition to more normal conditions. To the best of our ability to judge, the adverse balanceon current account in the first Stage II year, unless our burden is eased in otherways, will be of the order of  700 million nearly $3 billion even assuming thescope of Lend-Lease and Canadian Mutual Aid is unchanged and that the scale isthat indicated in paragraphs below.15. In the second year of Stage II we should hope for an increase of exports;any estimate must be very conjectural, but even on optimistic assumptions it isdifficult to see how overseas disinvestment can be less than $1 billion. Thus, onthe assumption that the war against Japan lasts two years after the defeat ofGermany, we should, on the hypotheses of the preceding paragraph, face the peacewith $3-^ to 4 billion added to our present liabilities. These are likely to be materially increased during the subsequent transition that is, during the period before we can reach equilibrium between our exports and our imports. We believethat, if we had to continue to finance a large part of our overseas war expenditurein countries other than North America by piling up larger and larger liabilities,$6 to $7 billion is a conservative estimate of the additional liabilities which weshould have to foresee, beyond the $11 billion dollars at which they now stand.16. We have attempted also to estimate the ultimate increase of british exports that would be necessary if we were to restore the equilibrium of our balance of payments without drastic change in our import policy. We already had a precarious balance in 1938; we shall have lost very considerable income from our overseas investments: our shipping earnings Avill be reduced; and unless we continue a strict regulation of imports, we must be prepared to finance agreater volume of imports than we obtained in 1938, to meet the needs of a largeremployed population. But in addition to the exports needed to cover our currentimports, we may be called upon to export a great deal more to enable the overseasholders of sterling balances arising out of the war by degrees to convert this ster-ling into goods in accordance with our capacities and their requirements. It wouldbe misleading to attempt to translate this into figures; to illustrate the magnitude of the problem, to convert 1 per cent, of our total liabilities into goods in a yearmeans further raising the volume of our exports by some 5 to 6 per cent.17. Though many of these factors cannot be precisely assessed, they indicate the basis on which we have set ourselves as a target the raising of our volume of exports from their present level of about 30 per cent, of 1938 to 150 per cent, ofthat level. &apos;18. Our Reserves and Liabilities. We have shown, in the foregoing sectionsof this paper, the scope and nature of the problem which confronts us in Stage II.And we have indicated the extent to which our.external financial position has deteriorated, and may yet deteriorate further, before we can re-establish a soundpeace-time economy after the war. But in order to complete the picture it isnecessary to consider also the reserves that we hold against our liabilities andtheir adequacy in relation to the calls that may be made upon theim

In the early part of the war (and indeed in the year preceding it) we hadto meet very heavy overseas payments, and in order to do so realised overseasinvestments and sold gold and dollars to a total of nearly $4 billion; therefollowed the critical period in 1941, when our net reserves had fallen to aninsignificant figure. Since 1941 these net reserves have been increasing at therate of about S500 million a year; this increase has been due to a variety of factors : among them are the virtual cessation of large cash contracts in theUnited States; continued sales of gold by South Africa and others (partly offset by gold payments to certain third countries); and, above all, substantial receipts inrecent months from expenditure by United States troops in the United Kingdomand the rest of the sterling area. Indeed, but for expenditure of troops our netreserves would have fallen over the first half of 1944 by some $120 million.21. Our need to hold liquid reserves is based on a number of different considerations.(a) We must hold &quot;working balances&quot; adequate to cover our short-term requirements in international commerce in conditions of normal trade i.e., the conditions to restore in which our externalbalance of payments is substantially in equilibrium.(b) We must hold reserves against our needs in the transitional period Stage III in which our balance of payments will still be heavilyadverse, and some part at least of the deficit vis-a-vis the rest of theworld must be covered in gold.(c) We must hold reserves against the needs of the sterling area, whoseexternal reserves in turn consist of sterling balances held in London.22. It is evident that the reserves we need by way of working balances mustbe related to the volume of our overseas transactions which, from the nature of our economic structure, must be substantial. We must for the purpose of our needsduring the Transition Period leave out of account the facilities which would beavailable to us from the International Monetary Fund, which are not intended tomeet the difficulties of the Transition Period, &quot;but to be available after we haverestored, or nearly restored, equilibrium. We are concerned here with the more immediate prospects of Stage II and III and the abnormal factors which will operate in that &quot;period.23. We have shown earlier how great a contraction of our export trade wehave effected in order to carry on the war, and how far we shall have to go in orderto achieve equilibrium after the war. This will take time, and in the interim period the process of disinvestment will continue; though, as we hope, at aprogressively diminishing rate.   How far that process will consist of the further19. The following table summarises the movements of our gold and dollar resources and our liabilities : British Assets and Liabilities.
increase of our external liabilities and how far of the diminution of our reserveswe do not attempt to forecast. But it is clear to us that we must be prepared to face some considerable drain upon our reserves on this account.24. Moreover it must be emphasised that the reserves of the United King-dom constitute broadly speaking the reserves of the sterling area as a whole. Noother countries of the sterling area (with the exception of South Africa, which asthe world&apos;s greatest gold producer is in a special position) have any appreciableholdings of gold or of foreign currencies other than sterling. Their foreign currency receipts have gone into the United Kingdom pool, and they have looked to us to meet their essential foreign currency needs. All these countries are short of goods, and will have problems of reconstruction and restoration of civilianeconomy to face. They will seek to convert some part of their accumulatedsterling balances into foreign currencies for these purposes. How far their demands can be met will depend on the adequacy of the reserves we then hold.25. It will be seen from the table in paragraph 19 above, that our netreserves now amount to only about one seventh of our quick liabilities. In thelight of the foregoing considerations they are manifestly inadequate in relation tothe calls that may be made upon them. Their inadequacy will inevitably placelimits on the capacity of the sterling area to import from the United States andother countries outside the sterling area. It is in the interests of the UnitedStates, no less than our own, that those limits should not be unduly narrowed, andthat our reserves should be built up to an adequate level in relation to our needs.Furthermore the longer we are confronted with the position of having insufficientreserves, the longer must be delayed the date at which we can fully achieve thepurposes of the International Monetary Fund.26. Our reserves in relation to our liabilities, are very much smaller thanthose of other countries. The free reserves of the United States are many times as groat. The gold and dollar reserves of Russia (which are not published) are estimated by the United States Treasury at $1-6 billion. The corresponding figure for France is $2 billion or more. The reserves of the Netherlands, belgium and China are believed to be of the order of $750 million in each case. none of these countries has any significant amount of overseas liabilities against whichthese reserves are held in contrast to a position under which the United Kingdomalready faces liabilities of the order of Sll billion with reserves of little morethan $1  billion.* IV. Our Objectives in Stage II.27. In Stage II, His Majesty&apos;s Governments military and economic policy has five main objectives : (a) To make our full and proper contribution to the Japanese War and tothe forces of occupation in Europe.(b) To re-expand our export trades so that we can begin to recover our financial solvency and move towards the position, where w7e can paywith exports for our necessary imports.(c) To rebuild our cities and begin to overtake the arrears of housing andmaintenance.(d) To make good the more important of the war-time deficiencies ofindustrial and public utilities maintenance.-(e) To raise somewhat the greatly reduced standards of civil consumption.We have recently made a detailed examination of the man-power and other resources necessary to meet certain defined programmes in respect of each of the objectives. As shown in Annex 3, these are not capable of simultaneous aehieve-ment; for in total they would represent a demand for man-power some 9 per cent,in excess of our probable supplies, even after allowance is made for Lend-lease and Mutual Aid on the scale indicated below. Some or all of our objectiveswill have to be curtailed accordingly. We must maintain the military pro-grammes at the highest possible level, but some adjustment in our deploymentmay be inevitable for logistical reasons. It would, therefore, be right to regardboth our own munitions programmes arid those which wre arc putting forward forLend-Lease as representing maxima, within which certain downward revisionsmay be found necessary in the light of a re-examination that is now proceeding.[27910] c
28. The Munitions Needs in Stage II. For the reasons given in the last paragraph, our present plans are probably on the high side. On the basis ofthose plans, the total of the British Forces would be some 70 per cent, of thetotal at mid-1944. This, with the requirements of the other British EmpireForces, would imply during the first year a total volume of munitions supplies forthe British Empire about 75 per cent, of the present level, and about 60 per cent,in the second year. The munitions labour force by the end of the first year would be some 65 per cent, of the present level.29. Of the total munitions requirements of the British Empire, about59 per cent, are currently provided by Great Britain (see Annex 2). To theremaining 41 per cent, the main contributions have come from the United States(27 per cent.) and Canada (10 per cent.).30. It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the munitions require-ments of the British Empire should in Stage II continue to be supplied fromthese several sources, and that the contribution of each country should be reduced in the same proportion as the total effort is reduced. Thus, on the basis of thepresent plans they would propose that during the first year of Stage II theUnited States and Canada should make available to the British Empire onLend-Lease or Mutual Aid terms about 75 per cent, in each case of the volumeof munitions so provided during this year. They would at the same time plan to maintain in the United Kingdom a similar proportion of munitions product-tion. If it is later found necessary to reduce somewhat/the scale both of the deployment of Armed Forces and consequently of their requirements for munitions. His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose that the programmes shouldbe adjusted so that the several contributions to the British Empire munitionsrequirements should remain proportionate to those of 1944.31. In broad terms about one half of our Service man-power in Stage IIwill be directly engaged in the war against Japan, but of course a very much larger proportion of the material requirements will be for the Far Easterntheatres. It will, however, be impossible to segregate the requirements of theJapanese war from those of our Forces as a whole, apart from certain specialequipment which is specifically needed for the Japanese war as such. our requirements will have to be looked on as a whole, and the supplies needed forour Forces in the Far Eastern theatres will come from new production or fromother theatres according to shipping and supply considerations.32. In order to take full advantage of such munitions supplies as the UnitedStates may provide during this period, it is necessary that w*e should be ableto plan with the full knowledge that the)7 will be forthcoming. In the period which lies ahead, forward production planning in both countries will be greatlycomplicated by the reconversion of facilities and by the difficulty of restoring these facilities to war production when once they have been reconverted, and it maybe more appropriate to arrange for a firm British programme upon the UnitedStates, supplies from which would be automatically assigned to the British Forcesunless the Combined Chiefs of Staff agreed that a major and unforeseen strategicchange necessitated reassignment. This would have the advantage that it wouldbe possible to eliminate from British production the element of insurance thatwould otherwise be necessary against diversion of United States supplies from our own production programme; from the United States point of view this procedure would, have advantages in that the British needs would be knownclearly in advance and United States production could be planned accordingly.From both points of view7 considerable administrative work would be saved; thecomplicated process of detailed assignments is necessary and indispensable whenmunitions are very scarce and must be shared between, competing theatresaccording to an over-riding strategic plan. But in the conditions which ruleduring Stage II the simpler procedure which we suggest may be more appropriate.33. Our Civil Needs in Stage II. An assessment has been made of theman-power necessary to re-expand the export trades to something rather less thanthe 1938 level, to tackle the tasks of rehousing, and to satisfy minimum require-ments- for maintenance, re-equipment, and alleviation of civil conditions. Theprovision that has been planned would not do more than restore the supply of manufactured goods for the home market from the level of about 50 per cent, of1938 at which it now stands to a level of about 75 per cent. The figures given in annex 3 show the impossibility of meeting these limited objectives concurrently,even with the assistance that we regard as essential.
34. Over a large part of the field of civilian needs-those for food, materials and other necessities normally covered by imports the main problem in Stage IIis how supplies can be maintained at a sufficient level until our power to pay forthem by export is again restored. For it is evident that we shall not be in aposition to revert to a cash basis at this stage.35. It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that it is proper that thefood, raw material and other non-munition needs of the United Kingdom shouldcontinue to be met through Stage II, as hitherto, by Lend-Lease or Mutual Aidsupplies, so far as they may be drawn from North American sources. these supplies are no less a part of the war effort than the military supplies already discussed. Civilian mouths have to be fed and the economy has to be kept going.If we drew our meat to the maximum from Australia and our dairy supplies from New Zealand, bought all our oil from British sources in the Middle Eastand elsewhere, and turned our own shipping on to supplying the United kingdom as its first task, the Allied war effort in the Far East would be seriously damaged.In fact. Australian and New Zealand foodstuffs go to supply troops in theFar East, as does oil from the Middle East and much of our shipping. As a corollary we have to make good our requirements from the Western Hemisphere.Global strategy forces us to continue to look to the United States, and this globalstrategy is an integral part of the defence of the United States.36. The possibility that we should receive aid by way of loan insteadof Lend-Lease has been mooted. In regard to this, it is the consideredview of His Majesty&apos;s Government that this possibility would not meet their heeds. We could not regard it as equitable that the principle ofpooling of resources, on which we have based our war-time economy, should be abandoned without due regard to the problems with which, as the direct resultof our contribution to the common war effort hitherto, we are now confronted.It is generally recognised that the task of restoring the world economy afterthe war should not be complicated by the creation of war debts between thenations. This principle is no less valid now than earlier in the war. It mustbe frankly realised, moreover, that debts in dollars to the United States would inevitably be much more difficult for us to discharge than debts in sterling to countries which are, by and large, willing holders of sterling and whose economy is adapted to receiving payment in the form of goods and services which, given time, we shall be in a position to offer. We cannot enter into obligations to theUnited States which we cannot see our way clearly to honouring, nor can theUnited States Government desire that we should do so.37. Both Governments look forward to the restoration and expansion ofinternational trade. In that, the United Kingdom, as the world&apos;s greatestimporters of food-stuffs and primary products, must play a leading part. the prosperity of South America, as well as of Africa, Australasia and India, dependslargely on their sales of such products in the British market. These countries,to say nothing of the United Kingdom herself, have in turn been large importersof American goods. If it should prove necessary for the United Kingdompermanently to restrict her imports, the prosperity of many other countries, notexcluding the United States, would be materially affected-. Our task after thewar will be to rebuild and consolidate our external position, and we believe thatwe are justified, both by what we have clone in the war and what we can contribute to the peace, in asking that the United States Government give their sympatheticunderstanding to our problems.Y. The Proposed Scale of Lend-Lease in Stage II.38. (a) Munitions. We have prepared programmes for certain munitionswhich we ask to be supplied on Lend-Lease terms. The total quantities coveredby these programmes are somewhat greater than would be represented by areduction in the first year of Stage II as from 100 per cent, to 65 per cent. Forthis there are two reasons : first, a progressive reduction from an employment of100 per cent, to one of 65 per cent, over a period of some months yields in ourown case, and we should expect it to yield in the United States, substantially more than 65 per cent, production of finished munitions over the first year;second, we would wish to leave some flexibility for subsequent discussion andadjustment of actual programmes within the totals that we have put forward.[27910] ,    c 2
These programmes are given in detail in Annex I and are briefly summarised below :  (i) Navy. Our programme for landing ships and craft and repair shipsmust depend upon discussion of our operational requirements. Therewill be a continuing programme, on a rather smaller scale than before,for certain guns, ammunition, fire control equipment, naval andvictualling stores of the types in which we have been assisted by theUnited States supplies in the past,(ii) Ground. Nearly half of the assistance we have obtained in the pasthas been in the form of tanks, their equipment and spares. this element in our needs will be greatly reduced, and we are asking for continued supplies on a slightly reduced scale of the trucks, engineerstores, signal stores and miscellaneous supplies which we have been receiving in the past,(iii) Air. We are putting forward substantial requirements of aircraft,especially of the very long-range bombers and transport aircraft,which are essential to the most effective use of our other resources inthe war against Japan. We have always been largely dependent uponAmerican assistance for aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm, and we askfor continued supplies on rather more than the present scale of theparticular types which are necessary for our carrier fleet. In additionto complete aircraft, we have been assisted in the past by supplies of engines, propellers and other components for incorporation in British(and Canadian) aircraft. We are asking for continued supplies of-   these on a reduced scale.39.

(b) Non-Munitions. We have estimated also our minimum needs fornon-munitions from North America. As was indicated above, these take accountboth of the possibilities of alternative supplies and of the limits set by the need to make provision for the Forces in the Pacific from the nearest available sources.The programmes are set out in detail in Annex I. They are briefly summarised below : (a) Food. The programme is slightly below the present level, and will permitno easement on the present rations. We have taken into account themaximum supplies which wc can expect from other sources aftermeeting local military needs and the limitations which will still persiston long hauls.(b) Oil. The estimate of our oil requirements is based on the Second united nations Survey and United Kingdom Service Departments estimates,and assumes that shipping arrangements will be broadly similar tothose prevailing at present subject to some modification throughcessation of convoys. It leaves United States forces demands to bemet under reciprocal aid.(c) Shipping. The amount of Lend-Lease aid under this heading will depend on the shipping arrangements prevailing during Stage II.The estimate below is based on the assumption that present arrange-ments will remain substantially unchanged. They are, therefore, littledifferent from the estimates put forward for the Fifth Lend-LeaseAppropriation.(d) Raw Materials. -The programme we are putting forward is that whichis essential to our production needs on the clear understanding that what is used for export will be paid for.

The latter are bare essentials.With the assistance for which we ask, we can hope to play our part in theJapanese war, to take the first necessary steps towards financial solvency, andto raise civilian standards something less than half-way from their presentinsufficient level towards that which we enjoyed before the war.

The figures throughout this Annex are based on current plans. those for Stage II may have to be revised downwards, because some part of theman-power shortage indicated in Annex 3 may have to fall upon the Serviceand Munitions allocations : see paragraph 27 of the Memorandum.)1. At mid-1944 the mobilisation of British man-power has reached itshighest point. There is likely to be some subsequent readjustment as betweenthe Munitions Industries and the Armed Forces, but the total is likely to fallrather than increase, as casualties and industrial wastage exceed any possibilitiesof further transfers to the war sector.2. The strengths of the Armed Forces sustained from United Kingdomrecruitment&apos;at mid-1944 are as follows : Total.2,918.000854,0001,176,000Totals ...      4,500,000 448,000 4,948,000* Omitting Nursing Services.3. The man-power in the munitions industries (engineering, chemical and shipbuilding industries) occupied on work for the three Supply Departments isas follows : Total Both Sexes.Ministry of Supply       .........       1,390,000Admiralty............ 896,000Ministry of Aircraft Production       ...       1,753,000Total ......       :.....       4,039,0004. Thus the over-all total of man-power devoted to the direct prosecution of the war either in the Forces or in the manufacture of munitions in theengineering and chemical industries at mid-1944 is as follows : -Forces      ...............      4,948,000Munitions ...   &apos;.........       4,039,000Total ............       8,987,0005. The United Kingdom munitions labour force has to provide not only forthe Forces provided from the man-power of the United Kingdom but also for those of the British Empire, as w7ell as for aid to Russia and to the United states under Reverse Lease-Lend. But in this larger task its contribution is supple-mented by the production of the rest of the Empire and by the Lease-Lend andother assistance received from the United States. It is estimated that at thebeginning of 1944 (and the same proportions apply in total fairly closely through-Quantity.$60,000,0009.000,0007,000,0005,000,00019,000,000100,000,000Men.

At the end of the first year of Stage II it is estimated that the numbers in the Forces to be sustained from United Kingdom recruitment would, on thebasis of present plans, need to be as follows : Men. Women. Total.Army      ......      1,652,500 116,000 1,768,500Navy       ......        760,000 60,000 820,000Royal Air Force ...        716.000 100,000 816.000Totals ...      3,128,500 276,000 3,404,500This represents 68-8 per cent, of the Forces at mid-1944.7. The munitions labour force which it is proposed to employ in GreatBritain at the end of the first year of Stage II will be approximately 2,650,000persons. This is 66 per cent, of the mid-1944 munitions man-power. It wouldbe distributed between the three Departments approximately as follows : Total Both Sexes.Ministry of Supply      ......... 850,000Admiralty ............ 740,000Ministry of Aircraft Production        ...      1,060,000Total        ...       ......      2.650,0008. On this assumption the distribution of British man-power in the forces and munitions would be as follows : Mid-1944-        Stage II.Forces   .........      4,948,000 3,404,500Munitions        ......      4,039,000 2,650,000Totals      ......      8,987,000 6,054,000Per cent....... 100 67-49. The production from this labour force during the first year of theJapanese war would be approximately 75 per cent, of the output during 1944.Proportionate aid in the first year of Stage II would thus mean supplies aggre-gating 75 per cent, of the total now obtained on Lease-Lend and Mutual Aidterms. In the second year of Stage II it wrould mean supplies equal to about60 per cent, of those now obtained.ANNEX 3.1. The Objectives of Man-power  Policy in Stage II. The main objectives in Stage II are set out in paragraphs 27-37 of the memorandum; they are(a) a proper contribution to the Japanese War; (b) the re-expansion of our export trades, so as to restore our financial solvency; (c) the rebuilding of ourcities; (d) the overtaking of arrears of industrial maintenance; (e) some relaxation of the cuts of civil consumption. The allocations of man-power must give appropriate weight to each of these rival claims.2.   The Military Needs of Stage II:  (1) Forces. The estimated require-ments from the man-power of Great Britain for the three Armed Forces are put at 3,400,000 if we are to meet our various responsibilities and obligations in[27910] d
I Stage II on the scale now planned (see Annex 2). This figure compares withI an estimated total strength of 477,000 at mid-1939 and of 4,825,000 at end-1944.3. The Military Needs of Stage II: (2) Munitions. The total man-power required for the production of munitions in the British engineering, chemical and1 shipbuilding industries would, on the basis of current plans and on the assumption of proportional aid, be 2,650,000 (see Annex 2), or with certain adjustments tocover employers, the iron and steel industry and over-age workers, 2,723,000.In addition, there is a wide variety of stores and equipment produced outsidethese industries, which in 1944 has involved the employment of about 820,000workers, and which is estimated during Stage II to require about 489,000.4. Exports. Before the war there were in Great Britain approximately,300,000 engaged in direct manufacture for export. During the war, partly asthe result of Lease-Lend, partly through the disposal of foreign assets, partlythrough the incurring of foreign debts, it has been possible to maintain importsat the necessary figure while drastically curtailing exports. The man-power nowdirectly engaged in producing for export is about 300,000. But because of thedisposal of assets and the incurring of debt, it will be necessary either to increaseexports above their pre-war level by some 50 per cent., or to make comparablereductions in imports. It is of urgent importance that Great Britain shall as quickly as possible take the first steps towards financial solvency. The immediatetarget is to restore the man-power engaged in export to approximately the pre-warfigure, apart from mining and food manufacture, where such a level is not regarded as immediately practicable. This target would involve an increase from about 300,000 to about 1,150,000 in direct manufacture. Because of the periodof production and of the necessary intervals between manufacture and payment,the restoration of the pre-war man-power in the export trades will not give animmediate equivalent increase in the value of exports.5. Building. Even before the present attacks on London, the tasks ofrebuilding damaged towns were far greater than could be quickly achieved. Thefurther devastation, while adding greatly to the tasks, cannot, unfortunately, be balanced by greater achievements. The planned re-expansion of building is basedon estimates of the practicable rate of demobilisation and reabsorption of skilled and unskilled building workers. It is hoped to raise the total labour force from about 638,000 at the end of 1944 to 927,000 at the end of the first year of Stage II.In addition, a figure of 100,000 is allowed to cover workers (mostly outside thebuilding industry) engaged in making pre-fabricated temporary housing.6. Provision for the Home Market. As is indicated in Annex 4, there willhave been for nearly four years a reduction of the order of 50 per cent, in thevolume of clothing, household equipment and other essentials provided for thehome market. There have been much greater reductions in the supply of manyforms of domestic durable consumption goods, and many households are now ingreat need of replenishment. Furniture and equipment wall be necessary toprovide for the homes that are to be built or reconditioned. In the field of publicutility services, maintenance has been repeatedly postponed, and cannot be much further delayed. The turn-over to civilian products will involve considerablere-tooling, and depreciation in many of the civilian industries will need to bemade good. The additional man-power requirements for manufacture for thehome market, together with mining, public utilities and transport have been estimated to amount to about 1,798,000.Apart from these, there is likely to be some increase in the man-power devotedto distribution, commerce and services generally. Many of those who will be released from the Forces will have been drawn from these industries, and it willnot be possible to prevent some re-expansion of them. The estimated increaseof man-power^ in them is about 212,000, making, with the 1,798,000 above, an estimated addition of about 2,010,000 to the man-powrer serving the home market,raising the total from 8,991,000 to 11,001,000.The effect of such an allocation of man-power to the home market would be toraise production from the level of a little over half of pre-war at which it now stands, to about four-fifths of pre-war thus bridging about half the gap betweenpresent and pre-war levels of production in these industries. But because of thetime required for reconversion and manufacture, and the need to rebuild stocks at every stage of manufacture and distribution, actual consumption in these fieldscould not quickly be restored even to four-fifths of pre-war.7. Estimates of Manpower Available. The total man-power requirements for these by no means over-ambitious. objectives amount to 21,846,000. Theestimated available supplies of man-power in Stage II do not exceed 20,075,000,even when no allowance is made for any increase of unemployment above thefigure of 75,000 at which it now stands.   Thus there is a gap of at least If million
between the probably available man-power and the requirements, which may be appreciably increased if transitional unemployment cannot be kept at a very low level in time of rapid transfer.8. The Limitations set by man-power. No final decisions can be reached atthis stage as to the actual distribution of the available man-power. This much is,however, at once apparent. The limited objectives that we have set ourselves areimpossible of simultaneous achievement.Distribution of British Man-power.(000*s.)	Mid-1939.	Mid-1943.	End-1944.*	Stage II.

The British civilian has had five years of black-out and four years ofintermittent blitz. The privacy of his home has been periodically invaded bysoldiers or evacuees or war-workers requiring billets. In four years of drasticlabour mobilisation, nearly every man and every woman under 50 without young children is subject to direction to work, often far from home. The hours of workaverage 50; when work is done, every citizen who is not excused for reasons of family circumstances, work, &amp;c, must do 48 hours a month duty in the home guard or Civil Defence. Supplies of all kinds have been progressively limited by shipping and man-power shortage; the queue is part of normal life. Taxationis probably the severest in the world, and is coupled with continuous pressure to save. The scarce supplies, both of goods and of services, must be snared withhundreds of thousands of United States, Dominion and Allied troops; in thepreparation of Britain first as the base and then as the bridgehead, the civilianhas inevitably suffered hardships spread over almost every aspect of his daily life.2. This is the price of total war, which the British are well satisfied to pay.But the cumulative effect over a period of years must necessarily be a severe strain. The blitzes of 1940-41, the food difficulties in the Spring of 1941, theman-power mobilisation step by step from 1940 to 1943, the steady disappearance of manufactured goods from the shops these are a cumulative pressure uponcivilian standards which cannot indefinitely be maintained. It is impossible to measure the pressure precisely; only a part of it can be measured at all in[27910] d 2
material terms. But in this paper is set out the course of the chief materialelements which make up the civilian standard of life. In general, this covers the period to the end of 1943, but in 1944 the position is not significantly different from that of 1943. some minor increases being more than balanced by contractionselsewhere and by the general pressures arising from the increased Servicepopulation.3. No attempt is made here to set out a total balance-sheet of civil consump-tion per head; the technical difficulties of doing this in a meaningful way are considerable, when account must be taken of the increased needs of a population in which more people are at work and when a substantial part of the suppliesof consumer goods and services is consumed either by institutions N.A.A.F.I.,canteens, hospitals, &amp;c. or by British and other soldiers of the United nations in the United Kingdom.Housing.4. The change in housing conditions has been dominated by war damage, byrequisition for Services and by billeting, by the drastic reduction of facilitiesfor normal repair and by cessation of house-building (300,000 houses were builtyearly before the war). Some indication of the degree of loss clue to war damage is given by the fact that of some 13 million dwellings in the United Kingdomsome 3-4 million had been destroyed or damaged by enemy action before the start of the flying-bomb attacks. Of these, 170,000 had been totally destroyed. Of thoseseriously damaged 80.000 were still uninhabitable in June 1944, and the greatmajority had not yet had complete repair. Much even of the repair which is&quot;complete &quot; for the time being will later have to be re-done or supplemented. the flying-bomb attacks on London have created new damage which at first outran therate even of first-aid repair, and special measures had to be taken to bring building-labour into the London area in order to tackle the rapidly growing arrears, even atthe expense of essential government work elsewhere.5. In certain areas, entire villages have been requisitioned by the militaryauthorities; heavy demands have been mnde on rural house-room by the Servicesand evacuees, and in the industrial areas of the Midlands and the North by theneed to billet war-workers.6. Normal house-building has been at a standstill since 1940; the labourengaged upon running repairs, painting, &amp;c, for all premises has been reduced from 300,000 in 1938 to 140,000 in 1943 (excluding War Damage repair), and itis estimated that in the three years 1941-43 only eighteen months&apos; normal houserepair was done.7. War conditions increase domestic requirements of fuel and light. In adrab life of black-out, dull food, damaged and draughty houses, and the familyfeeding at different times because of their various shifts and civil defenceresponsibilities, more fuel is needed for heating, lighting and cooking, and the lack of it has a disproportionate psychological effect. Furthermore, theadministrative difficulties of controlling fuel consumption are very great; thediversity of household patterns makes rationing impracticable. There has,nevertheless, been some reduction in consumption, and it is fortunate that recentwinters have been mild. The actual course of domestic consumption is difficultto measure, for domestic deliveries are statistically indistinguishable fromdeliveries to shops, offices and even small industrial undertakings. It is estimated,however, that the 1943 domestic consumption of coal, coke, electricity and gasrepresented the usage of some 66 million tons of coal, or about one-third of thenational output; this represents about 1^ tons a year per head of the civilian population. The comparable pre-war figure is not precisely determinable, but the1943 rate was probably a few per cent, below pre-war.Travel.8. - An appropriate measure is the relation of public travel facilities towartime needs. In.certain respects more travel is needed than in peacetime.There have been the periodic evacuation waves, and consequent visits by parentsto their children in the country; workers are directed to work further from their homes; others have to move their homes, either because of enemy action or becauseof a new workplace; Servicemen&apos;s wives must visit their husbands; millions ofBritish and Allied soldiers must take leave; there is, in addition, the great volumeof military passenger movement.  On the other hand, holiday facilities are greatly
restricted. It is the custom of the British people, none of whom live more than80 miles from the sea, to spend their holidays at the seaside and the whole ofthe South and East coastal areas have been restricted since 1940 from time totime; those holidays which war-workers have been able to secure have been forthe most part spent at home, a very real sacrifice not only for the war-workersthemselves but even more for their Avives.9. On balance, there has been an increase since 1938 in the total number of passenger journeys oil the British railways by about 10 per cent., including trooptrains. But the total number of passenger train-miles has fallen by nearly30 per cent. This in itself is an indication of the way in which the railways havebeen compelled to herd the passengers into the trains; it is said, indeed, that if the passengers were animals, the railway companies would be prosecuted by thehumane societies. In the summer of 1944, as part of the measures to clear therailways for the invasion, there have been hew and drastic cuts in long-distancepassenger services, equivalent to a further reduction in train-mileage of some10 per cent. Furthermore, the almost total disappearance of fast trains,restaurant and sleeping cars has imposed considerable hardships.10. The shortage of petrol and tyres and drivers has led to drastic cuts in public service road transport, especially over long distances. Fuel consumptionof vehicles in these services has been cut by about 40 per cent.&apos; 11. Private motoring has, of course, been cut much more severely. since june 1942, petrol has been available to private motorists only on proof of need;a ration is permitted only to doctors, officials travelling on business and the like.The weekly consumption of petrol by private cars and motor cycles had thus beenreduced from 47,600 tons in 1938 to 6,000 tons in 1943, or about one-eighth of thepre-war level; if purely personal consumption be considered, excludingprofessional and business use, the cut is from 513 million gallons in 1938 to 7-6 in1943, or to a comparative level of 1^ per cent. The number of cars licensed has fallen from 2,034,000 in August 1939 to 715,000 in February 1944, and the numberof motor cycles from 418,000 to 107,000.12. The supply of new bicycles has been reduced by 55 per cent., but theusage of the existing stock has greatly increased, and the supply of tyres ofinferior quality to cyclists has nearly doubled. This is an inevitable result of the curtailment of public transport and the drastic cut in private motoring.Other Merchandise.13. Supplies of manufactured goods have become progressively scarce.Some, such as clothing and soap, are rationed; others, such as furniture, areobtainable only by permit; others tend at intervals to disappear from the shopsaltogether; in some cases (e.g., kitchenware) the supply must then be stepped up;others again, such as newspapers, are in reasonably plentiful supply, but either the buyer gets a much smaller article for the pre-war price or the product is taxedvery heavily. Rationing and price control limit expenditure on necessities, andthe great volume of public purchasing power eats up the supply of uncontrolledgoods as it appears, .the State taking a rake-off both in purchase tax on such products up to 100 per cent, and by 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax.14. Change in quality and indeed of the nature of goods supplied to thepublic makes measurement difficult, but the following table shows the estimatedpersonal expenditure on manufactured goods in   millions at 1938 prices.1938.      1939.      1940.      1941.      1942.      1943.Clothing ...      ...      447      447      375      277      273      259Household goods ... 274 260 203 148 104 88Other goods    ......      219      219      193      158      129    . 125Total    ......      940      926      771      583      506      472These expenditures were made by a civilian population some 7^ per cent,smaller than in 1938. But they include all purchases made by members of theBritish and Allied armed forces,\*.(g., everything which Servicemen in this countrydo not receive in kind; they also include all supplies to N.A.A.F.I., canteens,hospitals, ships&apos; stores, &amp;c. Purchases made to replace blitzed possessions are,of course, included.15. Broadly, purchases of manufactured goods had fallen by one-half in1943; the 1944 supply may not be very different.  But the actual leVel is not the
whole story; supplies have now been very scarce for three years, and as wardrobesand domestic stocks become exhausted, the effects of shortage grow cumulatively.In 1941 it was not difficult to manage with a clothing supply of 60 per cent, of pre-war; in 1944 the whole order of hardship is different. In the five years ofwar, assuming 1944 the same as 1943, the population has received only three years&apos;normal supply of clothing, something over two years&apos; supply of household goods and some 3-g- years&apos; supply of other goods. This shows a backlog of re-equipment,towards restoring some parts of which a beginning must soon be made.16. Clothing rationing was introduced in mid-1941, and the aggregatevolume of consumption was, in 1943, about 42 per cent, below pre-war. Bootsand shoes, however, fell by only 28 per cent. The following table shows theaverage numbers of certain garments purchased on the current ration by adultsnot receiving the industrial supplement. This is expressed as a rate of purchase;as stocks are now pretty constant, this reflects accurately current productionpossibilities : Overcoats and rainwear ....Outerwear (i.e., suits; or jackets withodd trousers ; costumes ; dresses ; orodd skirts or slacks with jacket orblouse)  ....Shirts       ............Under garments (all kinds,corsets)- ....Socks and stockingsNightwear ....Footwear (all types, including slippers)Men(18 and over).1 in 4J- yearsWomen(18 and over).l2&apos;i years.including in 21 years in 9 months in 9 months  ..in 5 months ..in A\ years in 13 months..1 in 9 months.1 in 4 months.1 in 2  months.1 in 4 years.1 in 8 months.The ration in 1944 is 48 points, with special allowances for certain types ofworker. It is estimated that supplies will have to increase to permit-a ration ofat least 100 points a year before it is possible to stop rationing.17. Consumption of household goods furniture, hardware, hollow-ware,crockery, soap, electric lamps, &amp;c. had fallen in 1943 below one-third of the 1938level. These supplies had to meet the institutional demand as well as that of personal users; personal supplies had also to meet the losses of existing stocksthrough enemy action, which though unknown must have been large. Many types of goods, especially those of the best quality, are no longer available, and the range of designs from which the consumer can choose is much narrower; both these factors tend to make the consumer&apos;s position even worse than it appears from thereduction in total supplies.18. Supplies of furnishings, (including furniture, upholstery, carpets,curtains, &amp;c.) were in 1943 only some 20 per cent, of the pre-war level. from mid-1942 the production of metal furniture was prohibited, and early in 1943that of wooden furniture for private households was restricted to &quot;utility&quot;models. No furniture at all is now being produced for replacements or improve-ments, as utility furniture, other than nursery articles, may only be suppliedagainst permits, and these are only issued to people setting up house, including those who have been bombed, and to parents needing a bed for a growing child.Despite this limitation on the type of recipients, the limited number of eligibleclaimants so greatly exceeded the available output that the original allowance had to be halved. The present scale of 30 &quot; units &quot; for a couple is admitted todo no more than provide a nucleus; it would, for example, provide only  double bed; 1 kitchen table; 4 upright chairs; 1 dressing chest or sideboard;1 dining-table or armchair; 1 set of book-shelves. Even this scanty allowance is reduced where the applicants have some furniture available, and demandscannot be satisfied without considerable delay. The output of utility furniture(none of which is upholstered) for private use increased rapidly in 1943, and during the second half-year was at the rate of some 4 million &quot; units &quot; a year enough for 130,000 households at 30 units each.19. The use of jute and cork in the manufacture of floor coverings is prohibited, and present output is all of debased quality. Supplies of woolcarpets and rugs were only 1 - 4 million square yards in 1943 against 39 millionpre-war; of felt base 5-7 million square yards against 35; of linoleum andsubstitutes 8-6 million square yards against 51. Likewise the output of woollenblankets for civilian use, which before the war was about 6 million a year, had
fallen to 2 million in 1943; cotton blankets had been similarly cut to 4 million;and sheets to just over 3 million^ Even ignoring institutional purchasers, this last figure would provide one pair of sheets per person in 30 years.20. Supplies of domestic hardware in 1943 were about one-third of pre-war.Since 1942 the manufacture for civilian use of most electrical householdappliances, aluminium hollow-ware and lawn-mowers has been prohibited. Onlysimple forms of electric-light fittings are permitted. Refrigerators may be licensed on urgent medical grounds. A limited output of cookers, fires; kettlesand irons was permitted in 1943, almost entirely for institutional consumers; the16,000 cookers produced in 1943 may be contrasted with pre war supply of220,000-230,000. Production of domestic hollow-ware was reduced too far in1941-42, and it was necessary in 1943 to restore supplies to about one-half thepre-war level; the 1943 supplies, on the assumption that two-thirds of the outputwent to private consumers, were equivalent to one kettle for each household in^ years, one saucepan in If years, and one bucket in four years. Output of these goods will be higher in 1944, and the production of aluminium hollow-ware will-be resumed, permitting a very necessary improvement in quality.21. Production of plated or fancy cutlery was prohibited in 1942. Suppliesof table-knives in 1943 were 3-8 million, against 21 million pre-war, and ofspoons and forks were 5-8 million against 56 million. Probably not more than2 million knife-fork-spoon sets were available for private purchasers, equivalentto one knife, fork or spoon per household in every five years. The manufacture ofdecorated types of china, earthenware and glassware was prohibited in 1942 and&apos;&apos; austerity &apos;&apos; types were introduced; in this field again it was necessary to stepup the output in 1943, but the scale of output available to private purchasers isprobably inadequate to cover breakages.22. Other household goods in short supply include household brushes andbrooms, in which 1943 production was about 40 per cent, of pre-war, and matches,supplies of which are 55 per cent, of pre-war. Soap is rationed, but the level of rationing is sufficient to maintain very nearly the pre-war level of consumption -although at lower quality. Certain other supplies, such as electric lamp bulbsand garden tools are reasonably plentiful.23. In the picture of household goods, the lack of labour, for repair workand the acute shortage of spares and materials is significant. When a householdappliance breaks down, an interval of weeks may elapse before it can be repaired.It is extremely difficult to get supplies of timber and other materials for workabout the house.24. The heterogeneous collection of &quot; other goods,&quot; which in 1938 representednearly one-quarter of expenditure on manufactured goods, has followed diversepatterns. The production for civilian use of a wide range of goods radios,gramophones, pianos, cameras, golf and tennis balls, many types of leather goods,nearly all fancy goods, jewellery (except wedding rings) and many types of toys was prohibited from 1941 or 1942. Some licences have had to be issued to coversmall-scale production by people who were considered unsuitable for transfer to more essential work. A small supply of radio sets 250,000 to be produced inUnited Kingdom and 42,000 to be imported will be permitted in 1944 in orderto enable the volume of listening to be maintained. Supply of a further wide range of goods has been cut to token proportions umbrellas from 4^ millionpre-war to 470,000 in 1943, penknives from 7-5 million to 1-7 million, fountainpens from 9 million to 1-9 million. Supplies of other goods are limited by quota,e.g,, photographic film to 20 per cent, of the 1939-40 level (but manufacturerscan fill only about one-half of their quota), non-priority sports goods to 5-10 percent, of pre-war, and so on. Toilet goods have fared somewhat better : productionof razor blades for civilians, excluding N.A.A.E.I., has been at. 290 million,compared with 470 million pre-war; toothbrushes at 54 per cent, of pre-war;shaving brushes at 24 per cent, and other toilet brushes at 55 per cent. Supplyof lead pencils in 1943 was about 70 per cent, of pre-war, and of gramophonerecords mainly institutional was 55 per cent. The 1943 supply of radio valvesfor replacements for a radio population of 9 - 6 million sets was 3^ million.25. Clocks and watches were nearly all imported from Europe before thewar, and supplies for civilians have been almost negligible for some years. Theshortage of alarm clocks was so serious that supplies had to be imported underLend-Lease, being released at first only against permits issued to people on essential work who regularly had to rise before 5 a.rn.
26. Expenditure on books, magazines and newspapers has increased; theannual number of newspapers bought per adult civilian has risen from 180 to 208,but the number of magazines has fallen from 28 to 26; the number of books soldis probably not much less than 85 per cent, of pre-war, but the maintenance of sales has been possible only by the virtual exhaustion of pre-war stocks. the size of these publications has been drastically cut; the daily newspaper has4 pages, sometimes rising to 6, and the consumption of newsprint is less thanone-quarter of pre-war level; likewise the book trade has been maintained ona 43 per cent, paper allocation. Throughout this field real consumption in the sense of the quantity of resources consumed has fallen by anything up to two-thirds. This illustrates the nature of the consumption pattern, and the flow of purchasing power into channels in which the supply, even though of greatlydebased quality, is maintained.Drink and Tobacco.27. The same tendency is very marked in the purchases of drink and tobacco. These are the anodynes against the stress and boredom of war, andthe volume of consumption has increased by some 7 per cent., despite increases in taxation which have raised the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes from thegre-war Is. to 2s. 4d., and the price of a pint of beer depreciated in quality fromd. to Is. 2d. Expressed on the appropriate per head basis, the consumption ofalcoholic liquor (adult civilians plus all armed forces in the United Kingdom)expanded by 7 per cent, and that of tobacco (adult civilians plus British armed forces in the United Kingdom) by 17 per cent. So powerful is the pressure of purchasing power into unrationed channels, even of depreciated quality, that in1943 expenditure on drink and tobacco exceeded  1,000 million only slightly less than that on food and it yields the Exchequer a revenue of  707 million, asum not far short of the total pre-war revenue of the State.Services.28. There has, of course, been a vast contraction of man-power in the serviceoccupations. Employment in the distributive trades has fallen by about one-third;employment in miscellaneous services, such as hotels and restaurants and enter-tainment and laundries has fallen by about one-quarter; the number of peopleengaged in private domestic service has been reduced from about 1,400,000 to less than 400,000; only an insignificant fraction of those between 18 and 60 yearsof age is allowed, on grounds of hardship, to remain in such employment. Atthe same time there has been the inevitable flow of surplus purchasing power intothis field expenditure on entertainments at constant prices has increased bysome 16 per cent., and the Exchequer receipts from the entertainment tax have risen from  8 million a year to  40 million a year. Here even more than in thesupplies of actual goods, the public has felt the impact of the demands of the armed forces upon the very limited accommodation available.29. The result is, of course, that the standards of amenities and generalservices available have deteriorated enormously. The cut in the distributive tradeshas not been more severe than that in the quantity of goods to be supplied to consumers, but it has meant a disproportionate diminution of service the closure of tens of thousands of small shops, considerable effective restriction upon choice of retailer and the disappearance of all customary amenities such as domesticdelivery. There are the same number of families to be supplied, although with less goods, and about two-thirds as many people to supply them, at the same time as the machinery of rationing imposes more work upon them. In the hotels and restaurants, places of entertainment and the like, the demand for services is outof all relation with the supply. Laundries cannot take more customers and havea slow service, doubly difficult when wardrobes and linen cupboards are runninglow; the medical men who are still practising at home are pressed harder than before, and in some districts are definitely insufficient; the postal authoritiescannot maintain their pre-war service, as they must cope with increased trafficwith depleted staff. Repair work of all sorts (cars, bicycles, clocks, watches, &amp;c.)has become difficult.30. These are generally losses of convenience rather than of necessities, butthey all serve to increase the burden upon the ordinary civilian, who has more work to do, more duties to perform, less food to eat, less supplies of all kinds,and the possibility of being bombed out as well.   They press more heavily still
upon the women of the community, trying to run their homes and their jobs atonce, and forced at the same time to endure hours of waiting and queueing andworry of all kinds which the service occupations are designed to save. Theshortage of goods is tremendously more important than the loss of serviceamenities; but the lack accentuates the drabness and difficulty which is the centralfeature of the ordinary citizen&apos;s life towards the end of the fifth year of the war.Food.(The material in this section is taken from the Combined Food Board&apos;s study ofFood Consumption Levels in the&apos; United States, Canada and the UnitedKingdom.)31. At the period of greatest shortage in the first half of 1941 caloriesupplies fell to 90 per cent, of pre-war quantities, animal protein to 77 per cent,and fat to 81 per cent., and there were indications that the diet was inadequate.Since then, so far as bulk and nutrients are concerned, supplies have been maintained at an adequate level, but only by the assistance of Lend-Lease ship-ments from the United States and Mutual Aid shipments from Canada.32. The food position in 1943 may be summarised in the following table(taken from Food Consumption Levels, Table 1) : Average supplies in 1943.Milk and milk products, ex-cluding butter (milk solids)Meat, poultry, game, fish andeggsOils   and fats,kj LI O OCXincludingSugars and syrups ...Grains, potatoes, pulsesFruitVegetables    .......Beverages (tea, coffee, cocoa)Lbs.per head.4914938655097519712Change from1934/38(per cent.).-* 28- 2216312846339Proportions of total(by weight)+1934/38.3-617-94-38-837-213 113-81-31943.4-513-659535-46-6-918-01133. The increase in the consumption of milk is an achievement. Probably,also, the pre-war consumption of vegetables was too low, but the large increase under war conditions must be considered in conjunction with the drop in fruitsupplies. In other respects the table reflects a marked down-grading in thequality of British diet in the form of an increased reliance upon the bulky starchyfoods. Average calorie intake in 1943 was only 5 per cent, lower than in1934-38, but whilst total protein supplies were a little larger than in pre-war years, the proportion of protein of animal origin has declined. Supplies ofvitamins and minerals have been well maintained, largely through the increasein the extraction ratio of flour, the addition of calcium to flour, the fortificationof margarine with vitamins and the increased supplies of vegetables and of milk and milk products.34. The overall adequacy of the country&apos;s food supplies in terms of nutrientshas been proved by experience. What cannot be stated in figures are the loss ofvariety and palatability, the disappearance of familiar and delightful dishes, thehousewife&apos;s struggle to provide a main dish each day, the substitution of mass-feeding in canteens for domestic meals.35. Meat and bacon, butter, margarine and cooking fats, cheese, tea, sugar and preserves are rationed; distribution of eggs and milk is controlled with aview to ensuring preferential supplies to priority classes of consumers; tinnedgoods and many other foods (e.g., dried fruit, breakfast cereals, rice, biscuits, &amp;c.)are rationed on a points system; chocolate and sugar confectionery are on aseparate personal points system; fish, though not rationed; is scarce. Bread and potatoes and most vegetables are the only major food-stuffs in unrestricted supply.The rations are meagre when considered by themselves: a week&apos;s ration of meat (Is. 2d. worth of beef, veal, mutton, lamb or pork) could well,disappear in a single pre-war steak but is supplemented by ration-free offals,when procurable; a week&apos;s ration of bacon (4 oz.) would not leave much over froma. good pre-war breakfast; in winter the supply of eggs shrinks to one a month;and so on. But all classes supplement their rations by &quot; eating out&quot; in canteensand restaurants on a scale much greater than before the war.   It has been theT27910]
policy of the Ministry of Food to give priority supplies to industrial canteens.Schoolchildren, mothers and young children have also had preferential treatment.The people who suffer most are those who are confined to their houses by age orinfirmity, the sick and convalescent whose appetites need to be stimulated.36. Rationing has secured a more even distribution of essential foods overall income groups. But to ensure that all can obtain their share of the rationed foods prices have been strictly controlled. This has only been possible by meansof subsidies, which impose a heavy burden on the Exchequer. Rationing, however,has its own peculiar drawbacks and vexations for the customer, and for the traderit imposes additional work upon depleted staffs.ANNEX 5.The United Kingdom Post-War Balance of Payments.(l)[Note. The estimates in this Annex are still in process of revision.]Overseas Disinvestment.1. The following table shows the net overseas disinvestment incurred by theUnited Kingdom in each year since 1939 :  8m. $m.1939      ......        920 1942     ...... 2,5401940       ......       3.024 1943     ...... 2,6201941       ......      3,188 1944 (estimated) 3,000The Balance of Payments in Stage II.2. Little diminution in the rate of our overseas disinvestment during thefirst year of- Stage II (assumed to be 1945) would (unless our burden is eased byother means) be realised on the basis that Lencl-Lease aid is continued on thescale indicated in the Memorandum, Canadian Mutual Aid is continued on itspresent scale, and we successfully re-establish our export trade on such a scalethat the man-power devoted to exports by the end of the year is some 90 per cent,of the pre-war level. The following table shows that our deficit on current account might amount to some $2-9 billion : Estimated United Kingdom Balance of Payments^) First Year of Stage II (1945).Payments. $ billion Receipts. % billion.Imports (f.o.b.) ...      ...      ...   3-4    Exports   ...      ... ...      ... 1-8Shipping           ...       ...       ...   0-5     Shipping           ... ...       ... 0-war Expenditure        ...       ...   2-4     War Receipts    ... ...       ... 0-other Payments ...      ...       ...   0-6    Interest, Profits and Dividends 0 - other Receipts  ... ...      ... 0-740Balance      ... ...      ... 2-96-9    &apos; 6-93. The continuation of our overseas disinvestment after the cessation ofhostilities in Europe on this scale, despite the continuation of Lend-Lease and mutual Aid and a considerable rehabilitation of our export trade, can be attributed to the fall in income from United States and Canadian troops in theUnited Kingdom; the small reduction in our total war expenditure in India; thefact that exports, starting from an exceedingly low level at the beginning of theyear, can only gradually be built up; the delay between exports and the payment for exports; and the absence of a net income from United Kingdom snipping,which, at the moment, is working at a loss in terms of foreign exchange and during the period under survey is expected to earn only enough to coverdisbursements.4. In the second year of Stage II, as a result of the build-up of our produc-tion for exports, the net deficit might be reduced to $1 billion.    Altogether,(&apos;) All the figures in this Annex are sterling estimates converted into dollars at $4 to  1.(2) The table excludes supplies and services at present obtained under Lend-Lease and ourmunition requirements in Canada, which are assumed to be covered by Canadian Mutual Aid.
therefore, our overseas liabilities would be likely to rise by not much less than$4 billion during the two years of Stage II, making our total liabilities some$16 billion at the beginning of Stage III against reserves of some $2-2 billion.The Balance of Payments in Stage III.5. When the Japanese war ends, further important changes will take place.Receipts arising on military account will disappear; and there will perhaps be some increase in civilian imports. These adverse factors will be counter-balanced to agreater or less degree by a marked reduction in United Kingdom military expenditure abroad; a further expansion of exports; perhaps some appreciablereceipts from the sale of surplus military stores abroad; and some improvementin shipping earnings. It is unlikely, however, that in&quot; the first year of Stage IIIthese favourable factors will outweigh the unfavourable factors at work. TheUnited Kingdom deficit would be unlikely to fall below -$1 billion for the first year of Stage III.6. The question will then arise how quickly we can hope to close thisremaining annual deficit. It is improbable that, if (a) Lend Lease and CanadianMutual Aid ceased at the end of the Japanese war, and (b) we continued to finance our imports by piling up further liabilities, we should end Stage III with overseas liabilities below $ 18 billion.The Balance of Payments after the Transitional Period.. 7. If we compare the position of the United Kingdom at the end of thistransitional period (say, in 1950) with her pre-war position, in spite of manyunknown factors and of the impossibility of making any accurate forecasts so farinto the future, it is clear that there will be a number of fundamental changesrequiring substantial adjustments in the pre-war relationship between exports and imports. Either exports must be substantially7 higher or imports must be severely restricted; or some combination of increased exports and reduced importsmust be found.Income from Overseas Investments.8. Such income in 1943 has been estimated at some $500 million as comparedwith $800 million in 1938. We may expect some increase on the figure of$500 million by 1950, as a result of the return of assets in enemy occupation.Moreover, there may well be an appreciable recovery in income from some of ourremaining assets if there is reasonable world prosperity after the war. income from the European and Eastern countries, now under enemy occupation, isestimated to have been about $120 million in 1938. Allowing for some recovery of these assets, some increase in the yield on them as a result of the higher levelof prices in 1950, and some increase in returns over the present level on our other assets, income from overseas investment may amount to some $680 million in 1950.9. The reduction from $800 in 1938 to $680 million in 1950 does not,of course, allow for the reduction in the real value of such income, which will result from the rise of prices between 1938 and 1950. On the assumption that prices rise by 60 per cent, between 1938 and 1950 this decline in income from overseas investments would cause a gap in the 1950 balance of payments, whichit would take a 20 per cent, increase in the volume of 1938 exports to fill.Sterling Liabilities.10. In addition to the exports needed to cover our current imports, we shall need to export a great deal more to enable the overseas holders of Sterling balancesarising out of the war, by degrees to convert their Sterling into goods. It isimpossible to translate this into a precise figure, but by way of illustration anaverage amount of $360 million by way of exports for this purpose would require a further 12 per cent, increase in the 1938 volume of exports.Retained Imports.11. Unless special measures are continued to regulate imports, we must beprepared to meet some increase in the volume of imports between 1938 and 1950.Our need for raw materials will probably be greater. The volume of production is likely to be up, as a result of increased output per head, and employment may bebetter maintained than before the war; and, in particular, more raw materialswill be required to sustain the much larger volume of manufactured exports whichwe shall require to produce if our balance of payments is to be brought intoequilibrium.
12. There is likely to be a considerable increase in the demand for food-stuffs between 1938 and 1950. The maintenance of better employment; thepayment of family allowances; the development of social security; the eontinua-tion or development of war-time measures for the improvement of nutrition such developments, undertaken in the spirit of the resolutions of the Hot SpringsConference, will stimulate expenditure on food-stuffs. Even when allowance ismade for a substantial increase in the home output of food and animal feeding-stuffs, it seems probable that retained imports of food and feeding-stuffs will be appreciably higher.13. It is possible that the volume of retained imports for reasons such as these might be increased by rather more than 5 per cent, above the 1938 levelunless it were accompanied by the selective regulation of inessential imports;an expansion of the 1938 volume of exports of rather more than 10 per cent,would be required to meet these additional imports.Import and Export Prices:.14. One of the most important, but most uncertain of the factors affectingthe 1950 balance of payments is the relationship between  import and export prices.Will the prices of the essential imports of food-stuffs and raw materials, whichthis country imports, be held up by restrictive commodity agreements ? Will thenecessity which this country will be under to push its exports cause a markeddeterioration in the terms on which it can sell the greater quantities ? Inparticular, will this country&apos;s export drive take place in conditions in which thereare few or many tariff and other trade barriers to surmount in our overseas markets ? On the other hand, will the pre-war long-term movement tending toreduce the costs, and so the prices of primary products more quickly than thoseof manufactured products, be continued ? Will scarcities of primary productsdisappear more or less quickly than scarcities of manufactured products?15. For these reasons what will happen to the terms of trade is most-uncertain :-&apos; but it is an uncertainty of the utmost importance to the UnitedKingdom balance of payments. A 10 per cent, reduction is the price of ourcommodity exports relative to import and other prices would, of course, make afurther 10 per cent, expansion of exports necessary to fill the resulting gap in thebalance of payments.Other factors affecting the 1950 Balance of Payments.16. It is possible that some further gap in our post-war balance of paymentsmay be caused through loss of shipping earnings and other invisible exports.There is much uncertainty attaching to these items; but if there is a swiftrecovery in the tonnage of United Kingdom shipping, it is not certain that any loss in the aggregate of these items will be very appreciable. Pre-war estimates have suggested that there was in 1938 already an adverse balance of someS220 million, which would require a 14 per cent, increase in 1938 exports to close.This figure is, of course, subject to a wide margin of error, and war-time experience suggests that there may not have been a pre-war deficit of this amount.Conclusion.17. In view of the above considerations it would appear to be reasonable to expect a formidable gap in the 1950 balance of payments which might be equivalent in amount to some 50 per cent, of the 1938 volume of exports. As hasalready been explained, some part of this gap might be filled by a restriction ofimports. Some reduction of imports, for which allowance has not already beer,made, may well come about naturally as a result of improved competitiveconditions. If strict import regulation is to be avoided, a very great expansionof exports will be necessary; and in any case, if standards of living and the volumeof employment are to be maintained, a considerable expansion of exports isessential/ To meet the whokVof the gap by an expansion of exports would involvea five-fold increase in their volume from the present level, which is only 30 per cent,of 1938.18. The expansion of United Kingdom exports on a permanent basis mayitself prove the hardest of tasks. The war has disrupted our export markets.Connexions have been lost. Some of these have been permanently lost as a resultof increased industrialisation in overseas markets. Yet others may also be permanently lost, unless United Kingdom goods can re:enter overseas markets as quickly and as promptly after the war as the goods of third countries. Toincrease the volume of exports to the pre-war level and one half as much again,and then to hold that level permanently, will certainly prove a formidable task.
