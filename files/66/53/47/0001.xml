Information subsequently received shows that the Polish partisans with whom Warrant Officer Storey spent about a fortnight were a group of the extremeRight-wing Nationalist forces (N.S.Z.), which are, in general, less welldisciplined, armed and officered than the regular Polish Government forces. Itis all the more interesting that these units should nevertheless have been in touchwith Soviet partisan groups.A. E.Foreign Office, 15th August, 1944.ANNEX I.Report by No. 1431804 W/O T. Storey on his Experiences in Poland,April to June, 1944.(Reference : Map Europe 1/1,000,000 Sheet M 34 (Cracow), 3rd Edition.)W/O Storey&apos;s &apos;plane had been given a D/P in the triangle Kazimierz-Pulawy-Kurow, 20 miles west-north-west of Lublin. Before being able to fulfilhis task, his &apos;plane became damaged as a result of excessive oil leakage, or enemyground fire, and the whole crew of seven were forced to bale out south-east ofSandomierz.  This happened on the 23rd April last, at 2345 hours (approx.).The following are his own personal experiences : He was the last to leave the machine, and, owing to the necessity of having to destroy some special equipment, the machine was only some 400 feet from theground when he jumped. It seems that his parachute was slow in opening, andhe was slightly concussed.Finding none of his crew in the immediate neighbourhood, he started to look for help. The first building he came to had a sentry on the door, and was after-wards discovered to be a German barracks. This was the centre of a village; he regretted not knowing its name, for all subsequent questioning on this subject was met by the reply that this knowledge was useless, and that, were he caught,the Gestapo would have means of getting the knowledge out of him. He tried to enter other huts, but the doors were bolted and he got no answer. Eventuallyhe met a boy of about 17 who seemed very frightened on seeing him. He puthis hand over the boy&apos;s mouth and went inside the hut, where an older manpromised to keep him the night. Next morning, W/O Storey threatened the12476   [28014] B
peasant by saving that, were he handed over to the Germans, he would say thatthe peasant had given him shelter. After some thought, the peasant pulled upa floor-board, took out a rifle, and led him away into the woods, where he layhidden for two days with three other members of his crew who had been brought together by the Polish partisans. At this time they learnt that their &apos;plane wasa complete wreck. The partisans had searched during the night, and had onlymanaged to salvage a machine gun from the rear turret, with a bent barrel. Theywere told that the Germans had sent out some 300 men to look for them, and theground was constantly being patrolled from the air by Fiesler Storchs. Fiftyhostages had also been taken on their account.W/O Storey remained altogether a fortnight in the hands of the &quot; London-controlled &quot; partisans, one week of which was spent on the western bank of theRiver San, and one on the eastern bank, in the neighbourhood of Ulanow.His opinion of Polish partisan morale was not very high, especially amongstthe officers, most of whom were living in the forest with their waives and families.He said that German reconnaissance &quot;planes frequently flew over all the forestarea; on seeing a body of partisans, they would fire a signal cartridge, which was followed, soon after, by more or less intensive bombing. On such occasions heoften saw Polish officers panic. He thought the morale of other ranks was better,clue possibly to the fact that they had been forced to take to the woods for one reason or another, and consequently had no alternative but to fight the Germans.On the other hand, most of the officers were volunteers from the beginning. Hehad the impression that, though the Polish discipline was quite good, the officersappeared to give their men a number of unnecessary commands, and he oftensaw the men running about aimlessly.This Polish band was working under an Inspectorate whose Headquarters,he believed, was at Ulanow.The Polish commander tried his best to discourage them from asking theRussians for help. Indeed, relations between the Poles and the Russians were rather those of an armed neutrality. Each side was outwardly friendly to theother, but &quot;both the Poles and the Russians expressed their mistrust, in private,to the British crew. The Poles, indeed, actually admitted that had the Germantreatment of their country been better, they would have had no hesitation insiding with the occupational authorities against the Russians. On more thanone occasion, they said that they wished heartily that they were part of theBritish Empire, and they talked at length of the advantages they would haveclS R member of the Commonwealth.Eventually the Poles agreed to hand the British over to the Russians, asbeing the only way of getting them out of Poland, and, after several attempts,they were rowed across the river San at night. When they had been handedover, the Polish band insisted on remaining in the neighbourhood at a distance of 2-3 kilometres, to ensure, as they said, the safety of the airmen. Occasionallythey would visit the Russian camp, always bringing with them a bottle of vodka,and sometimes, too, the Russians would visit them, though in this case withoutany token presents. W/O Storey gained a definite impression that the Poles feltthemselves in an inferior position.The commander of the Russian band was a Polish Bolshevik called(\ Kinitzski) who had served in the Russian, German and Polish armies. almost all the other ranks were of Russian, White Russian, or Ukrainian nationality most of whom had escaped from German prisons or forced labour camps. Theseinitial cadres had been supplemented by officers directly from Russia. . The unitwas about 200 strong, and had its own W/T in contrast to the Polish organisa-tion, which only had a set at its Inspectorate Headquarters.Amongst the Russians there were a few women employed, principally ascooks and W/T operators, the latter being treated rather as officers. The women were treated exactly the same as the men, though they were treated with respect,and there was no trace of any promiscuity; indeed, the W/T operators slept inthe same tent as the commander.W/O Storey considered that the Polish information service was very good,and superior to that of the Russians. In the district in which he was, no bodyof German soldiers, however small, could move without the fact being known tothe partisans.Living conditions were naturally rough owing to the nature of the life andthe country in which the partisans were active, and which was largely forest andswamp, with small villages in the clearings. . When a cow was killed, there wasplenty of meat available for 2 or 3 days; but in general the staple diet waoblack bread of very poor quality.  Some of the large bands had a doctor attached
to them, but, on one occasion, W/O Storey had a foot lanced by a partisan witha knife. The only disinfectant to hand was raw spirit, which the partisanspreferred to drink (in ordinary times mixed with water but taken neat before an attack), In general, they broke camp before dawn to avoid bombing, which apparently was a regular event, and which after some time became ratherunnerving.In contrast to Polish supplies, those of the Russians were good, especially the arms and ammunition. The Poles were furnished with an enormous variety of out-of-date weapons. On one occasion the air crew saw an old Maxim whichhad been dug up out of the ground, and which required four men to lift. they also had many old rifles of French pattern. The Russians steal a large quantityof the supplies dropped by us to the Poles, and W/O Storey saw many items ofBritish equipment, including watches and boots, which were of British pattern.The Russian partisans, however, never take our automatic weapons, which theydespise especially the Sten guns. W/O Storey himself agreed that the Russianpattern Tommy-gun was superior to the Sten. Many of the Russians were alsoarmed with German machine-pistols.Neither of the bands with whom the air crew were, was actually attacked by ground forces while the British personnel were with them; the Russians told them one night that they had just derailed a train with five German generalson board. German reprisals appear to be quite as severe as is generally thought,and is invariably worked on the principle of ten Polish lives for one German.The sufferers are naturally the peasants, from whom all sides, including theGermans and the non-partisan bands of brigands commandeer freely and withoutpayment. Almost all the villages seen by W/O Storey had been burnt out, andit was not an uncommon sight to see a family living under a tree in the forest,with a cupboard and two or three mats.The non-partisan bands just referred to live simply by plunder, and haveno other ulterior motives. They are hostile to all but the Russians, who furnishthem with arms.W/O Storey says that although the Russian band with whom he wasnumbered about 200 men, he never saw more than about 50 at a time, since theremainder were always foraging or on outpost duty. All men were issued with russian Tommy-guns, including the air crew themselves, who were actually givenalarm posts. The Russian commander himself admitted that his men were oftengiven &quot; suicide jobs.&quot; It seems that orders were received direct from Moscow, andthere was never any thought of disobeying them. At the beginning of June, allRussian bands received orders to fight their way North-eastwards towards Brest-Litovsk and the River Bug.W/O Storey was told that the Russians dropped no food to their partisans,but only arms, including M.G&apos;s, heavy mortars, and sabotage material, includingmines. The parachutes used are of white silk, and containers are reinforcedsacks. They can tell British supply parachutes both by their colour and theinferior quality material of which they are made.Russian pin-pointing and dropping practice is, in the opinion of w/O Storey, far inferior to ours. The following is the diagram of ground signalsused, and which W/O Storey believes to be unchangeable (* = flares): -50 metres--[ - WIND*     50 metres     *     50 metres     *The aeroplane flies into the wind, one vertical Verey light being fired, aswell as one horizontal one along the flare path.Before leaving Poland, the air crew had themselves to find a suitable landing-ground for the 5plane which was to carry them away. This they had to do several times, as on each occasion a body of Germans had moved too close for the safeoperating of the ground. On the last occasion they found the ground three days before they took off. This was situated between Krzeszow and Bilgoraj. It was actually a cornfield, and, on the last evening, they flattened and hardened the surface by dragging, with horses, logs of wood over it about an hour&apos;s work.Some days before their evacuation a Russian Captain was dropped, whoalleged that he had been sent to help to recce, a suitable landing ground. He,however, spent most of his time interrogating the air crew, in company with thePolitical Commissar. One of the latter is attached to each Russian partisangroup, his job being to lecture the men once a week on topical subjects. In thisconnection the commanding officer, who acted as interpreter into the common[28014] b 2
language of German, afterwards took W/O Storey (who had consistently refusedto give any information about the operation which he was carrying out) on one side and privately told him he was quite right to keep quiet.Each Russian formation is divided into three groups cavalry, infantry and artillery- The officers were mostly in uniform, but the men and some of the junior officers were dressed in a variety of clothes. Men of the Polish unit, on the otherhand, were sometimes to be found in khaki. Even the peasants who occasionallyfound a stray container could sometimes be seen in the same dress.W/O Storey was told that on one occasion a senior German officer saw fromhis car four peasants, dressed in khaki, tilling a field. He at once had themsurrounded and brought to his headquarters, where he gave them a good meal andplenty to drink, and then confronted them with the fact that they were the fourescaped British airmen. In his disappointment in discovering who they reallywere, he handed them over to the Gestapo.The treatment by the Russians of prisoners taken was to strip the latter totheir underclothes and then shoot them. German spies, of which there were apparently many, were taken by horse and cart to the neighbourhood of the nearest German garrison, where they were split open and filled with straw or eggs.The horse was then wdiipped up, and the still living man was carried into theGerman garrison. The Germans retaliated by hanging all partisans caught fromthe gables of the houses. No mercy whatever was shown. In this connectionW/O Storey said that he and his companions considered setting up their ownguerrilla band with supplies from England, for he realised that having lived withthe partisans would be considered by the Germans as an act contrary to Inter-national Law, and they would be treated accordingly. The Russians were at a loss to understand the attitude of the Polish partisans, who, it was alleged, when a.train was wrecked, took only the uniforms from the German soldiers and let themgo free.Russian partisan equipment appeared to be good, compasses were of thewrist-watch type. The aircrew saw no respirators carried by the Russians, nor did the latter wear steel helmets, though he did see some German ones in useamongst the Poles. As has already been suggested, Russian medical equipmentwas so poor as to be almost non-existent; the sticking plaster had few adhesivequalities. Both Russian and Polish maps were good, even cart tracks being shown; the Russian ones had apparently been printed during the decade beforethe war. Both vodka and &quot; Machorka &quot; were usually to be had, the formerbeing the main reason for raids on towns. On one occasion alone, they captured80,000 litres. The Machorka was usually smoked in the papers received by thePolitical Commissar for educational purposes.The German garrisons were continually on the move. Just before he leftPoland, W/O Storey was told that 24,000 second-line S.S. troops were massingat Bilgoraj with the object of &quot;clearing up&quot; the district. Their morale was reported to be very low, and they wrere mostly boys of 15 to 17 years of age.Russian methods of getting information out of the British airmen weresometimes rather crude. The Russian pilot who.had been dropped once offered to send back a message to the airmen&apos;s relatives, providing they used the R.A.F.code. They were also asked details of R.A.F. briefing before operations.W/O Storey found it advisable to keep his crew together on such occasions, toavoid individual questioning.It was also suggested to the aircrew that, if they should ever be ordered to bomb Moscow, they should land their &quot;plane in Russia and say that they hadonce lived with Russian partisans.W/O Storey heard talk of Ukrainian separatists being used by the Germansas garrison troops in Southern Poland.Though discipline amongst the Russian partisans was extraordinarily good,W/O Storey was surprised to see the commander hitting one of his men, a ladof 16, on both cheeks, at the same time threatening him with a revolver.The W/T set used by the Russians was portable, and the power hand-operated.W/O Storey and three of the original crew of seven left for Kiev in a russian D.C. 3 aircraft on the 6th June. Of the remaining three, one who spokeno foreign languages had at once been handed over to the Germans by some Poles;the other two are still, as far as he knows, in the hands of a group of Polishpartisans in the district North of Rzeszo-Yaroslaw. He believes that arrange-ments are being made for their safe evacuation.The aircrew were also accompanied in their flight to Kiev by a Pole, whonaa oeen attached to them by the Polish partisan commander as an interpreter.
His English was extremely poor, and W/O Storey believes that his real functionwas to be that of an &quot; observer &quot; in the Russian camp. Upon arrival in Kiev hewas taken away and not seen again. Another aircraft full of woundedaccompanied them.At Kiev the party was met by a Lieutenant-Colonel, who asked them somesearching questions. They were lodged in an hotel and, though living conditions were good, they were kept there as virtual prisoners, being allowed out once a day to walk in the park for about a quarter of an hour. On one occasion they werevisited by a War Correspondent, who asked them what their operational taskhad been. To this the Lieutenant-Colonel, who was present at the interview,replied that, as he himself did not know, it was unlikely that the journalist would receive an answer.After a week in this city the party left by air for Moscow on the early morning of the 14th June. On arrival they were taken to &quot; a dingy office &quot; in aback street, where they were given a meal but were not questioned further. Inthe afternoon they were taken to the Otdel, where they were handed over toLieutenant-Colonel Burrows.15th June, 1944.ANNEX II.Supplementary Report by W/O T. Storey of his Experiences with PolishPartisans.Composition of the Polish Partisan Band with whom WjO T. Storey remainedfor a fortnight before he and his companions were handed over to theRussian Partisans.The band consisted of three officers and twenty men who before the war had followed a number of professions. They included a doctor, a solicitor and several engineers. Most of them had been conscripted by the Germans to workin munition factories : they had there indulged in sabotage until the Gestapohad tracked them down, when they had been forced to take to the woods. Theircommander, Lt. Kmicic, was a regular Polish officer.of about 28 years of age who suffered from nervous strain and heart trouble. At the end of the Britishairmen&apos;s stay with the band it was reported that German troops were massing inthe neighbourhood and the partisans thereupon joined up with another Polishband of some 200 former Polish troops who were carrying out partisan warfareunder an officer named Father Jan.Impressions gleaned in talk with Polish Partisans.In addition to what he has already told Brigadier Hill, Warrant OfficerStorey stated that the Polish partisans with whom he talked* in the smallerband were disappointed that they had received inadequate weapons and especiallytoo few machine guns with which to light the Germans. They were inclined to blame the British until W/O Storey explained the difficulties in the way ofproviding supplies. Both officers and men were consumed with eagerness toknow about the way in which the war was going, the role which the Polish Armyin Britain was playing and the likelihood of the British using their influence to prevent the Soviet Union from absorbing Eastern Poland. Most of those with whom he talked seemed convinced that the British were deliberately delaying a landing in France in order to conserve their strength for the day when theywould have to fight the Soviet Union over the Polish question. Both officers andmen were filled with despair when they heard Mr. Churchill&apos;s speech of the22nd February declaring that Russia&apos;s demand for assurances about her Westernfrontiers did not go beyond the limits of what was reasonable and just. All thePolish partisans with whom W/O Storey spoke expressed loathing of theGermans, but even greater loathing for the Russians for having stabbed them fnthe back when they were not fighting the Germans and thereaffter deportingthousands of their countrymen into the Soviet Union, of whom nothing had since been heard.* N.B. Owing to his knowledge of German, W/O Storey was able to talk with themembers of the band, all of whom could speak some German. The Commander of the Polishpartisan group also spoke fluent German.
Their information about the outside world was derived from undergroundnewspapers and the wireless (the latter gave Polish news from Britain). Being-unable to read Polish W/O Storey knew nothing of what the underground news-papers contained. The men with whom he spoke did not refer to the newspapersexcepting in a general way.The larger Polish Partisan band.At the time when the smaller Polish band joined up with the largercontingent of Polish soldiers W/O Storey had been permanently living with theRussian partisans and therefore saw little of the new arrivals, although he paidthem an occasional visit. He had, however, met their commander, Father Jan,a lieutenant of about 35 years of age who impressed him as a good soldier.Jan and Kmicic gave him letters to the Polish High Command in london of which the originals and translations are attached. Father Jan incidentallypointed out to W/O Storey six Frenchmen with the contingent who had escapedfrom forced labour in Germany.Action by the Polish Partisans.Two days after W/O Storey and his companions had been handed over bypeasants to three of the Polish&apos; partisans in the smaller band, the remainder of the partisans in that group returned to camp from a raid on a large farmworked by Germans and guarded by five or six German soldiers. The occupantsof the farm and the soldiers had retired on the approach of the partisans, firingas they went. (One of the partisans had been killed by a tommy-gun bullet.) Aday or two before he left them most of the partisan band went on an excursionto hold up a train which had been reported to them as containing Polishprisoners on their way to a concentration camp. When, however, in company with another band of Polish partisans with whom they had joined forces en route,they arrived at the place where they had been led to think that the train would pass, they found Germans in occupation of the railway line with whom theyhad a bitter skirmish. Seven of the partisans from both bands were more orless seriously7 wounded and were brought back in carts and delivered over to thelarger contingent of Polish partisans, who had Red Cross nurses and equipment.All these casualties had been wounded by dum-dum bullets.So-called &quot;Bolshevik Bandits.&quot;The smaller band of Polish partisans with whom W/O Storey7 stayed spoke to him of other bands which they7 described as &quot;Polish Bolshevik Bandits.&quot;They7 said that these &quot; bandits &quot; (or Polish partisans) were supplied witharms by the Russians. (N.B. The Russian partisan leader, when questionedby W/O Storey on this point, stoutly denied it, but without carrying anyconviction.) They declared that these opposition partisans would sometimesattack them unawares and that at least two of their number had been lost in a recent encounter. In four villages which W/O Storey passed when moving aboutwith the Polish partisans, peasants came up to them in utter distress and com-plained that they had been raided by &quot; Bolshevik bandits &quot; who had robbed them of their horses, cows, pigs and carts.Relations between Russian and Polish Partisans.As already stated in Brigadier HilFs report, the Polish commander did his best to discourage the British airmen from asking the Russian partisans for help.Apart from a reluctance to let the British men know the Russian side of the picture, it was plain that he hoped that if he and his men could themselves findmeans of putting the British on to a training aeroplane they would improve theirchances of getting much-needed supplies from Britain. His reluctance to handover the British to the Russians did not, however, reflect itself in any unpleasant-ness towards his guests, whom he and his men were constantly at pains to treat asallies.W/O Storey was told both by the Russian and Polish partisans that theyhad received instructions from their respective Governments to co-operate. ThePoles complained that this co-operation had been too one-sided. They declaredthat, although all Polish partisans supplied Russian partisans with information and escorted them through enemy-occupied territory, they had, with the exceptionof an occasional gift of tommy-guns to some partisan groups, received in returnnone of the weapons for which they had continually asked. (N.B. W/O Storeysaw no- Russian weapons in the possession of the smaller partisan band, but
noticed about six &quot; pa-pasha &quot; automatics in the possession of the above-mentionedlarge Polish contingent.)In general, the Polish partisans deplored the fact that they were under instructions to help the Russian partisans, arguing that this would merely assist in permanent Soviet occupation of the territory where they were operating. on one occasion the leader of the Polish partisans told W/O Storey that when theRed Army advanced nearer to the place where he and his men were operatingthey would move further to the West in order, as he put it, to be. &quot; nearer theBritish invading army &quot; and to avoid giving help to the Russians, which wouldmake it easier for them to remain in permanent occupation. (N.B. W/O Storeyhad previously heard him assure the Russian partisan leader that his band wouldthen stay and fight alongside the Russians.)The Russian partisans on their side blamed the Poles as bad neighbourswho had wished in the past to annex the Ukraine. They spoke contemptuouslyof the Polish partisans, laughing at their weapons and belittling their exploits.They rarely referred to the opposition Polish partisans and when, as happenedon two occasions during W/O Storey&apos;s stay with the Russian partisans,Lieutenant Kmicic paid a call to report looting by these people, the Soviet partisanleader took the line that their activities, though regrettable, were no concern of his. On one occasion, however, the Russian partisan commander, a captain,aged about 28, and a fine specimen of a man, showed W/O Storey some snap-shots which included a group of the opposition partisans. He pointed to theirleader remarking that he was &quot; a good friend of mine &quot; and that he and his fellow Poles were followers of General Berling and much better people than&quot; Sikorskiite &quot; partisans.In general, W/O Storey, as already stated in Brigadier HilTs report, had gained the impression that the relations between Poles and Russians were thoseof an armed neutrality.&apos; During his stay with the Russian partisan group boththe small and larger Polish contingents were camped about 2 kilometres away. the rank and file of the partisans did not fraternise with one another. There was,however, a coming and going of officers, but mainly of Polish officers visiting theRussian encampment. On two occasions W/O Storey met. Soviet partisan officers on their way to visit the Polish camp. Three Polish officers, on the other hand,were constantly paying visits to the Russians. So far as W/O Storey and hiscompanions could gather these visits were mainly connected with their ownpresence, the Poles being anxious to take a share in the eventual evacuation oftheir British Allies. These Polish officers would, as often as not, bring a bottleof vodka with them and stay to supper. The atmosphere at these meals wasoutwardly cordial, but there was a strong under-current of strain and mutualmistrust.
