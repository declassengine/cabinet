THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENTSECRET COPY No.      ^ kW.P.(44) 42133 st July. 1944.   WAR   CABINETEmployment of German and Italian Prisoners-of-war memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour and national ServiceJ       At their meeting on 12th. July, the War Cabinet asked me toexamine, in consultation with the Ministers concerned, thepossibility of employing German prisoners on agricultural work(f.M,(44)90th conclusions).     I found it advisable to include inthis examination the possible use of German prisoners in forestryand quarrying, as well as in agriculture.2.     The conditions under which German prisoners could be employedhave been considered by the Security Executive.     They take the viewthat it would be most undesirable to employ German prisonerswithout guards on any work whatsoever even in small parties and recommend that:(e)    for the time being at least, German prisoners should beemployed only in gangs of twelve or more under 8rmedescort;(b)   members of submarine crews or of the German Air force should not be employed.3,     On this basis the Departments concerned estimate that, subjectto satisfactory arrangements in regard to accommodation, they couldemploy forthwith the following numbers of German prisoners:Ministry of Agriculture 15,000Ministry of Supply (forestry)     1,200Ministry of War Transport under 1,000(quarrying) total  &apos;     up to      17,200The Minister of Agriculture has stressed the importance ofadditional labour from early August to the middle of October, ifrthe harvest is not to be endangered.     After the middle of October,
he would be prepared to consider the release of some German prisonersfor other work.4.     Any German prisoners to &quot;be employed will have to he housed inprisoner-of-war camps, and the only suitable camps available are nowoccupied by non-co-operating Italians.     In order to make room for17,000 Germans, an equivalent number of non-co-operating Italianswould have to leave the camps, and be given alternative accommodation.This can only be done if they change their status and become co-operators(i.e.  they would be prepared to undertake military work forbidden bythe Geneva Convention, in return for more amenities then are availableto the non-co-operator, including accommodation outside a prisoner-of-war camp),      In order to induce as many as possible of the non-co-operators to change their status, it will be necessary to provideimproved amenities for co-operators.     Specific recommendations whichhave been put forward, and approved from the security point of viewby the Security Executive, are as follows:-(a) Payment in sterling of not more than 50 per cent, of wages(this imposes in practice an upper limit of 5/- a week);(b) Access to shops and post offices and use of telephone (thegreater part of the mail to Italy is at present censored);(o)    An extension of the limit of free movement up to a five mileradius from camp or billet (and including the use of bicyclesfor pleasure) - this does not include the use of public transport, except under escort;(d) To be allowed out after dark but to be in by 10 p,i,;(e) Access to cinemas;(f) Permission to enter into conversation not to be restricted to fellow-workers (co-operators are at present instructedthat they may speak only to those whom they meet in thecourse of their work);(g) Removal of the prohibition of visits to private houses byinvitation.
It is not possible to estimate whether these measures will besufficient to induce the necessary number of Italian prisoners to turn co-operator.     There are, at present, about 45,000 non-co-operating Italian prisoners, so that the figure of 17,000, which represents the number required to change their status, is an appreciable proportion of the total. My view, however, is thatthese measures are more likely to produce the desired result than any o^her possible alternatives.5.     Although any new co-operators would be liable for militarywork, the Secretary of State for War has agreed that he will make no claim on their services, except for any highly skilled men who couldbe effectively used in the Army.     The Secretary of State for Waralso undertakes the responsibility for the provision of the slightly higher standard of guards needed for German prisoners, sb comparedwith that needed for non-co-operating Italians.6.     The Departments concerned are seeking for alternative -*o-oofflmaccommodation outside the prisoner-of-war camps for any Italianswho may change their status, while a statement is being prepared ofthe camps from which German prisoners could be employed ifaccommodation in them were available.     Provided no objection tothese proposals is received I suggest that action be taken forthwith to put them into operation.     It will be necessary to take thePress into confidence in order to guard against any misunderstanding of these changes on the part of the general public.E o B .31st July. 1944.
