THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT ^ ^Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECEET. Copy No.      jW.P. (44) 426.2nd August, 1944.WAR CABINET.INDIA.Viceroy&apos;s Proposed Reply to Gandhi.I circulate telegrams received from the Viceroy about his recent correspon-dence with Gandhi. Lord Wavell proposes to send the reply given in Appendix IVto Gandhi&apos;s last letter (Appendix III) and asks for approval by the 4th August.I think that the Viceroy&apos;s proposed reply is generally suitable both in tone andsubstance, but I would propose to suggest that the wording be modified in certain respects. I attach (Appendix V) the reply which, if my colleagues agree, I would propose to send.The important points which these proposed alterations seek to emphasiseare (1) That any interim provisional Government must be within the framework of the existing Constitution.(2) That any such interim Government must continue until- such time afterthe end of hostilities as a new Constitution comes into operation, andTreaty arrangements between India and this country have been concluded as contemplated in the Declaration of March 1942.L. S. A.India Office, 2nd A ugust, 1944.APPENDIX I.Telegram from Viceroy, dated 26th July.1449-S.Following is text of letter from Gandhi, dated 15th July, and of my reply,dated 22nd July : Begins: 2. From Gandhi to Viceroy. You have no doubt seen the authentic copies,now published in the Indian press, of statements given by me to Mr. Gelder ofthe News Chronicle. As I have said to Press, they were meant primarily to be shown to you. But Mr. Gelder, no doubt with best of motives, gave the interviewpremature publicity. I am sorry. The publication will nevertheless be a blessingin disguise if interview enables you to grant at least one of my requests containedin,my letter of 17th June, 1944.3. From Viceroy to Gandhi. Thank you for your letter of 15th July. Ihave seen statements you made to Mr. Gelder, and your subsequent explanation of them. I do not think I can usefully comment at present, except to repeat what i said in my last letter, that if you will submit to me a definite and constructivepolicy I shall be glad to consider it.  Ends.4. I am telegraphing text of both letters to be sure that it is available forthe debate.  Neither letter has yet been published.[27939]
APPENDIX II.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 1st August.1491-S.MY two immediately suceeding telegrams contain text of Gandhi&apos;s letterof 27th July to me and draft reply. I should like decision on draft reply by4th August if possible as I am on tour from the 5th and should like reply to reachGandhi before he sees Jinnah.2. I consider reply must go beyond blank refusal of Gandhi&apos;s proposal and give impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government are receptive and anxious topromote a settlement. The only paragraph in my draft likely to give difficulty isparagraph No. 4. Indian opinion regards Cripps&apos; offer as falling into two parts :(1) post-war arrangements for framing new constitution, and (2) proposals for interim government. It is necessary to use form of words which does not exclude(1) as an independent undertaking. Opening words of my paragraph No. 4 are intended to cover this point. But paragraph is drafted to deal mainly with (2) asI am replying to Gandhi proposal for National Government.&quot; After describingform of transitional government that His Majesty&apos;s Government would accept,I point out that agreement on general basis of new constitution and method of framing it would be necessary to success. It has never been publicly stated that agreement of this kind was essential condition to interim government of Crippstype, though contrary opinion was expressed at India Committee meetings Iattended in London. I have attempted in draft to cover the point without statingit as a new condition and think this important.3. I still believe Gandhi&apos;s main objects are: (1) release of working committee, and (2) transfer of real power to Congress. Main value of replyis therefore likely to be effect on moderate opinion here and on opinion at homeand in U.S.A.APPENDIX III.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 1st August.1492-S.. Following is text of Gandhi&apos;s letter of 27th July. Begins: I must admitmy disappointment over your letter of 22nd instant. But I am used to work in face of disappointment. Here is my concrete proposal. I am prepared to adviseWorking Committee to declare that in view of changed conditions mass civildisobedience envisaged by Resolution of August 1942 cannot be offered and that full co-operation in war effort should be given by Congress, if a declaration of immediate Indian independence is made and a National Government responsible to Central Assembly be formed subject to proviso that, during pendency of war,the military operations should continue as at present but without involving any financial burden on India. If there is a desire on the part of British Governmentfor a settlement, friendly talks should take the place of correspondence. But Iam in your hands. I shall continue to knock so long as there is the least hope ofan honourable settlement. After foregoing was written I saw Lord Munster&apos;sspeech in House of Lords. The summary given by him to House of Lords fairlyrepresents my proposal. This summary may serve as a basis for mutual friendlydiscussion.  Ends.APPENDIX IV.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated, 1st august.1493-S.Following is text of draft reply to Gandhi. Begins: Thank you for your letter of 27th July.   Your proposal is :-(i) That you should undertake to advise the Working Committee (a) &quot; thatin view of changed conditions mass civil disobedience envisaged by theresolution of August 1942 cannot be offered,&quot; and (b) that full co-operation in war effort should be given by Congress,&quot; provided 
(ii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should (a) declare immediate Indianindependence, and (b) form a &quot; National Government &quot; responsible to central Assembly, &quot; subject tp proviso that, during pendency of warmilitary operations should  continue as at  present but without; involving any financial burden on India.&quot;2. Since your letter was written you must have studie4 statement made byMr. Amery in the House of Commons on 28th July, and will know that thisproposal is not acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government as a basis for discussion.It is very similar to proposal made by Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad to Sir stafford cripps in April 1942, and Jlis Majesty&apos;s Governments reaspns for rejecting there are same as they were then.3. Although His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept your present proposal and I do not think that we shotdd make progress if ive met in order to dismissit, I must assure you that they are most anxious for a settlement of the Indianproblem. The war is now moving fast, and unless we can reach agreement on lines satisfactory to all parties, India can hardly take her proper place at peaceconference, and our plans for post-war economic and social development will be hampered.4.   I 4c not wish to prejudge any proposals that may later be made to me,but jf the leaders of Hindus, Moslems and other important minorities were willingto co-operate in a transitional Government which would be established and would work within the framework of present Constitution without modification byconvention or otherwise, I believe we could make progress.   It is quite clear that until the war is over the responsibility for defence and military operationscannot be separated from the other responsibilities of Government, and that untilnew Constitution takes shape His Majesty&apos;s Government and Governor-Generalmust retain their responsibility over entire field.   If transitional Government isto succeed there must, I think, be agreement before it is formed between Hindusand Moslems and other important minorities as to general basis of new Constitu-tion and as to the method by which it should be framed.   This agreement seems tome a matter primarily for Indian leaders.   I should be glad to help them to achieve it if I thought I could do anything to help; but I doubt if I can do anything until they have come closer together than they are now.   I beg you to remember that minority problems are not easy.   They exist in many countries and have caused much unhappiness and even civil war.   It is a mistake to saythat minority problems in India have been created by the British; they are real and can be solved only by patience and generosity.   The period after the war is over for which the transitional Government would last would depend on speedwith which the new Constitution could be framed.   I see no reason why work onConstitution should not begin as soon as the transitional Government takes office,and if parties had arrived at a genuine agreement as to the method of framingit, / do not think the period need be very long.5.   You and Mr. Jinnah have my good wishes for your approachingdiscussion. Ends.(The words in italics are those to which amendments are proposed in thedraft reply which follows.)APPENDIX V.Draft Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy.1. Your telegrams 1491-S and 1493-S have been considered in Cabinet.His Majesty&apos;s Government agree with your proposed reply subject to following amendments : (a) Paragraph 3, first sentence. After &quot; although &quot; substitute &quot; I cannotregard your present proposal as one that I could recommend for theacceptance of His Majesty&apos;s Government and indeed I do not think we should make progress by meeting for discussion on that basis, i must.... &amp;c.&quot; Object is to avoid any suggestion of difference of view between yourself and His Majesty&apos;s Government and in order not to appear to rule out meeting and personal discussion, but only meetingon basis of present proposal.
(&amp;) Paragraph 3, second sentence. After &quot;hardly&quot; substitute &quot; play, herproper part in the post-war settlement, and our plans .... &amp;c.&quot; It isnot certain yet whether or when there will be a Peace Conference, butit is certain that there will be many matters requiring settlement inwhich India should take part.(c) Paragraph 4.   Omit words &apos;&apos; without modification by convention orotherwise&quot; in first sentence. There would probably have to bemodification in sense that official members of Council exceptCommander-in-Chief would disappear, and I would hesitate to say at this stage that there could be no conventional changes at all. what we cannot contemplate is a wrritten or agreed convention which wouldin fact be not a convention but a modification of the Act.(d) Second sentence.   Before &quot;new constitution&quot; insert &quot;hostilities ceaseand the.&quot;(e) Second sentence.   For &quot;takes shape&quot; substitute &quot;is in operation.&quot;(/) Eighth sentence. For &quot;patience and generosity&quot; substitute &quot;mutualcompromise and generosity.&quot; The word patience might suggest a desire for delay on our part.(g) Tenth sentence.   Insert &quot; preliminary &quot; before &quot; work.&quot;(h) Tenth sentence.   After &quot; takes office &quot; insert &quot; if not before.&quot;(i) Tenth sentence.   For &quot; I do not think the period need be very long &quot;substitute &quot; the time taken after the war for coming to final con-clusions and for the necessary treaty arrangements with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be agreed upon need be very long.&quot;
