(44) 93 of the 8th Februarylast. This paper represents the agreed views of the various Departmentsconcerned with the question, including the Service Departments.A. E.Foreign Office, 24th July, 1944.MORALE IN GERMANY.Note. This paper was prepared before the recent attempt on Hitler&apos;s life,on which the only information so far available comes from Germanofficial statements.DURING the period since our last report German arms have suffered majorreverses on all fronts. In the West the much-vaunted Atlantic Wall has beenbreached and a solid Allied bridge-head established on the Continent of Europe.In the East the Soviet armies have surged forward in tremendous strength along the whole front. After a spring offensive, which carried them over the frontiersinto Roumania and Poland, they have launched a summer offensive which is nowthreatening East Prussia itself. In the South, Rome has been lost and marshal Kesselring&apos;s forces, withdrawing North, have hitherto been able to achieve nothing more than a series of delaying actions of short duration. the underground forces in occupied territories have caused increasing difficulties forthe Germans. Of the satellites, Hungary has been occupied, and Finland has only been bolstered up by a personal visit by Ribbentrop, and the promise of increased military assistance. The situation in Roumania and Bulgaria hasseriously deteriorated. The neutrals, even including Spain, have clearly showntheir belief in an Allied victory by cutting down, or stopping altogether, exportsof essential materials to Germany. The Allied bombing offensive over germany has been maintained in great strength, though there has been a slight slackeninglatterly. Vital production, e.g.,- aircraft and oil, has been increasingly affected,and there are now signs of serious economic strain and a shortage of essential war materials, especially oil, tanks and motor transport, at the front. The Luftwaffeis hopelessly outmatched on all fronts, and the failure of the U-boat campaign forthe time being has been openly admitted. The chances of exploiting Allieddisunity can never have appeared less promising.The only item on the credit side has been the materialisation at last of thefirst of Hitler&apos;s long-promised &quot; secret weapons.&quot;Our last report suggested that&apos; the prevailing mood in Germany was to suspend judgment on the outcome of the war until invasion from the West hadbeen attempted. During the period up to the beginning of June there was in factlittle change in the morale and spirit of the Germans as a whole. There was afurther deterioration in conditions of life, involving an accentuation of physical and nervous strain, but it was accepted with disciplined resignation. All reports12441   [27880]
2throughout the period under review have continued to stress the widespreadcondition of apathy and gloom which prevails in Germany. This condition comes from many causes-natural passivity, tiredness, fear and, above all, preoccupationwith the countless difficulties and worries of day-to-day life.The breaching of the Atlantic Wall came as a profound shock to the wholeGerman people, all the greater in that the reverses in the East had been explained to them as being the consequence of the transfer of forces from the East to the&quot; cruciali! Western Front. The secret weapon V. I. was exploited to check theserious decline in confidence in the military and political leadership of thecountry which resulted. But reports suggest that the effect was only temporary,and that despite extensive propaganda the decline is continuing.The full truth about the position in the East was concealed as long as possible from the German people, but the appearance in the communiques of familiarplace names cannot fail to have brought- home to them the seriousness of theposition. Their immediate reaction has shown that, despite the insistence ofGerman propaganda on the prime importance of the Western Front, they stillregard the Eastern Front as the one that really matters. Fear of the Russianscontinues to dominate their thoughts, and there are indications of widespreadanxiety that the threat from the East should be staved off at all costs, even if thisshould entail premature capitulation in the West.Certain hopes and fears, assiduously cultivated by the Propaganda Ministry,continue to confirm the German people in their present course of inaction. Thefears predominate fear of the Gestapo and fear of the consequences of defeat.The hopes are much less precise. They amount to little more than a vague hopethat something will yet save Germany from a disaster wmich seems inevitablebut which is too terrible to contemplate and must therefore in any case be post-poned as long as possible. There is also a more personal feeling, especiallyamongst the bombed out, that if they carry on they may yet be able to recoupthemselves in some undefined way for their losses. As against this, there havebeen indications of a tendency in some quarters to favour discontinuance of thewar now in the hope of resuming it later under more favourable conditions.Grumbling is reported fi&apos;om all parts of Germany and the prestige of Hitleris sinking. None the less the Nazi party remains the sole political organisation in the country. People are said to be becoming more susceptible to Communistideas. But there is little evidence that Communism has reached significantproportions. There is no evidence whatever of any organised opposition. Gestapocontrol is still effective.   Anxiety about foreign workers continues.The will to fight of the German soldier remains on the whole good, thoughpatchy. The present state of morale, however, is not necessarily a guide to thefuture. When with his unit, the German soldier is buoyed up by loyalty and discipline. Away from it, his morale is fundamentally low. This state of affairsseems to be appreciated by the High Command, who have attached increasing importance to the political indoctrination of the rank and file, and have takenall possible pains to conceal the extent of German surrenders which have takenplace in spite of Hitler&apos;s &quot; fight to the last round of ammunition &quot; order. great anxiety is shown by the High Command to maintain morale during the next few-weeks, and to this end any exaggeration or distortion of facts is consideredadmissible.Many German naval prisoners have been taken recently. While it is clearI that there are very few officers or men, now serving in the German Navy, whostill believe that Germany has a chance of winning the war, the fighting spiritof those in sea-going units such as U-boats, destroyers and E-boats is still high,and their feelings as to the probable outcome of the war do not influence theirwill to fight. On the other hand, shore-based naval personnel are, in general,apathetic. They are often older than sea-going personnel, and neither officersnor men made any great effort during the fighting in France. There is no reliableevidence available as to the present state of morale in the main units in norway and the Baltic.The past six months have seen a progressive deterioration in the fightingspirit of the German Air Force. There is evidence that widespread recognitionof the overwhelming qualitative and numerical superiority with which theGerman Air Force is faced on all operational fronts, the dissolution of severalbomber units and the shortages by which operations and training are nowhampered have gravely affected morale.There are indications that the German leaders regard Germany&apos;s positionas very grave. But, generally speaking, there is nothing to show that the leadingNazis do not intend to fight to the bitter end.  It should, however, be mentioned
that a recent report suggested that Himmler was strengthening his position in preparation for the overthrow of Hitler, with a view to making peace, almost atany cost, with the Russians. Evidence of the accumulation of neutral currenciesby Nazi leaders is also increasing, although confirmation of the persons involved is lacking. Meanwhile there is no sign of the emergence of any other potentialleaders in Germany. If the German High Command estimate that either a breakdown of military discipline, strain on the economic machinery, or the collapse of control on the home front threaten the complete disintegration ofnational life, it would be in the German military tradition to take whatever action was considered necessary in the overriding interests of the Fatherland.Conditions are more likely now than ever before to produce some such action.But it is by no means certain that the High Command, whose independence hasbeen weakened still further during the war years, are to-day in a position totake action even if they wished to do so.To sum up, the combined effort of the propaganda and security services inGermany, though unable to arrest a steady decline in the overall war effort ofthe civilian population, has so far proved strong enough to preserve order andto prevent the breakdown in the country&apos;s administration. German staminaand discipline have stood up to all shocks, and there are no concrete indications of an early internal collapse. It may well be that, in the absence of a catalystcapable of releasing the pent-up forces, the German masses, who on presentevidence appear to lack completely all qualities of will-power or initiative, will go down to chaos with their leaders. More than ever before the crucial factorsare the discipline of the German armed forces, the capacity of the strainedGerman economic machine to maintain a war on three fronts and the estimateof these factors by the German High Command. When either the German peopleor the German High Command estimate that the war machine is on the point of breaking, a situation will develop which may result in open crisis. That point is perhaps near. But given all the circumstances, it seems likely that any opencrisis, if it comes, will develop very suddenly and without much prior warning.
