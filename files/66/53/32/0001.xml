(44) 88th Conclusions,Minute 2) the War Cabinet decided that some of the &quot;Overlord&quot; securityrestrictions would have to remain in force for a further period, and agreed thaton the 1st August Sir Findlater Stewart should review these restrictions inconsultation with the Departments concerned and with the S.H.A.E.E.2.   The restrictions which fell to be reviewed were : (a) The visitors&apos; ban in the coastal area between the Wash and Southamptonand in the Scottish area.(b) The restrictions on overseas travel.(c) The restrictions on travel between Great Britain and Ireland.id) The suspension of the Aer Lingus Teoranta and the Swedish A.B. AeroTransport Service.(e) The restrictions on telephone calls between Great Britain and Ireland.3. Agreement was reached that the visitors&apos; ban should be lifted fromthe Firth of Forth area and that the special &quot; Overlord &quot; restrictions on over-seas travel and on travel between Great Britain and Ireland should be removed.An announcement of the lifting of the visitors&apos; ban in the Firth of Forth area was made on 29th July, and on 3rd August, the Home Secretary made a state-ment in reply to Parliamentary Questions indicating that there would be a relaxation of the special travel restrictions. The statement was drafted insuch a way as not to reveal to the enemy that all these restrictions were being withdrawn.4. It remains to consider what action should be taken with regard to theremaining restrictions, viz. : (i) The visitors&apos; ban in the coastal area between the Wash and Southampton;(ii) The suspension of the Aer Lingus Teoranta and the Swedish A.B. AeroTransport services; and(iii) The restrictions on telephone calls between Great Britain and Ireland.5. The attached extracts from a note by Sir Findlater Stewart show the considerations which were brought forward in the course of his review and therecommendations which he has put forward. It will be seen that there is agree-ment that on or about 15th August the Eire authorities should be told that theAer Lingus Teoranta service may be restored and the removal of the restrictionson telephone calls between Great Britain and Ireland should be announced. It isalso agreed that the future of the Swedish A.B. Aero Transport Service shouldbe settled by inter-departmental discussion.[27956]1G2
The main question left for consideration, therefore, is whether in the interestsof the cover plan the visitors&apos; ban should be continued for a farther period ofabout a month, on the understanding that S.H.A.E.F. will keep the matter under constant review so that the ban may be lifted as soon as it ceases to play a vitalpart in the success of the plan.0. L.Ministry of Production, S.W. 1,5th A ucjust, 1944.&quot; OVERLORD &quot; SECURITY.DURATION OF SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS.Extracts from a Note by Sir S. Findlater Stewart.******I.  Visitors&apos; Ban.S.H.A.E.F. were prepared to agree to the lifting of the ban in the smallScottish area on the Firth of Forth, but they were most anxious that it shouldbe retained in the coastal area extending from the Wash to Southampton. they pointed out that the &quot; cover &quot; plan was still operating with full effect, and thatit remained a vital factor in the continued success of operations in Normandy.In a recent letter to the Secretary of the Chiefs of Staff Committee on the subjectof Service leave, the Supreme Allied Commander wrote as follows : &apos;&apos; There is evidence that the enemy has been decisively influenced bythe suspension of leave in conjunction with the visitors&apos; ban. These tworestrictions together constitute the essential security background for themounting of an amphibious operation, and the removal of the one wouldneutralise the effect of the other.&quot;For this reason the Supreme Commander has asked the Chiefs of Staff not tosupport the restoration of privilege leave (other than 48 hours&apos; leave) on the1st August as had been suggested; and he attaches equal importance to the continuation of the visitors&apos; ban in the South-Eastern coastal belt.The Security Service and the operational and security authorities in thethree Service Departments supported S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s argument for the retentionof the visitors&apos; ban except in the Scottish area. On the administrative side, theWar Office, the Home Office and the Ministry of Home Security, while they didnot question the operational arguments for the retention of the ban, pointed outthat the position was becoming increasingly difficult to hold. Since the matter was last considered by the Cabinet, a further class had been added to the categories of persons permitted to enter the banned areas, members of the priorityclasses resident in areas liable to flying-bomb attack might now move, either by private arrangement or under the Government evacuation scheme, into theprotected areas. The addition of this class had added very considerably to thenumber and urgency of hard cases falling just outside the margin of eligibility,and had at the same time made it very difficult for the general public to appreciatewhy the ban must be maintained. This was particularly the case in East Anglia,where there was quite evidently very little in the way of military activity and where there had been a considerable influx of evacuees; the average memberof the public was hardly likely to understand why, in an area where no obviousmilitary preparations were in hand and to which there had been a considerableinflux of non-residents, persons who had quite often good reasons to enter muststill be refused permission to do so. Perhaps the hardest cases were those of individuals who, shortly before the ban was imposed, bought houses in theprotected areas and had since been debarred from taking up residence there, quiteoften with considerable financial loss as the result.We discussed the possibility of meeting the hard cases to some extent by adding additional classes to the categories of persons permitted to enter the areasubject to the visitors&apos; ban. S.II.A.E.F. would not oppose this if it could bedone without a public announcement; that is not possible because the absence ofsuch an announcement would make the concessions inoperative.   If there were
1 P Oany prospect of the ban being removed completely within a matter of weeks,those Departments who stress the present administrative difficulties would be content to continue on the present basis in the meantime. But S.H.A.E.F., while they cannot at present estimate how long they will wish the ban to continue, feelits extension will, if their view prevails, be more a matter of months than of weeks.If S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s views are accepted and the ban in the coastal belt betweenthe Wash and Southampton is left on for a considerable further period, therewill be increased pressure to consider the possibility of adding further classes,designed to meet hard cases, to the &quot; permitted &quot; categories, with the consequentnecessity for some form of public announcement. Even if new &quot; permitted &quot;classes were defined so as to comprise only small numbers of people, this piece-meal relaxation of the Orders could not but react unfavourably on the &quot; cover &quot;plan; and it was with this consideration in mind that the Secretary of Statefor War, in answer to a question by Sir W. Wayland, M.P., on the 25th July,said he could not hold out any hope of further relaxations until the time came to revoke altogether the remaining Protected Area Orders.4f *)f 4^IV. Aer Lingus Teoranta and Swedish A.B. Aero Transport Service.S.H.A.E.F. were not strongly opposed to the restoration of either of these services; they felt that the restoration of Aer Lingus Teoranta would followlogically after the restrictions on Irish travel had been removed, and, provided the announcement was suitably timed (see Section VI below), they were preparedto accept it. Similarly, after the restrictions on overseas travel had been liftedthey did not see any strong objection from the point of view of the &quot; cover &quot; plan to the restoration of the Swedish line, with again the same proviso about itsannouncement.The Security Service and the security authorities in the War Office did,however, see strong objections to the restoration of the Swedish Service.   they made the ppint that the crews of the aircraft which operated this line flew to britain on one journey and to Germany on the next, and that information whichthey might carry therefore reached the enemy very quickly.   The Foreign Office,on the other hand, were opposed to the indefinite suspension of the Swedish line,which the Swedish authorities were most anxious to reopen; they did not regard the problem as one of any great urgency, but a delay of more than a few weeks \might put them in some difficulty vis-a-vis the Swedish authorities.   This matter Jwill be discussed further under the aegis of the Security Executive, and might well ibe left for settlement inter-departmentally.V. Telephone Calls between Great Britain and Ireland.Up to the present it has been generally agreed that, so long as the special restrictions on travel between Great Britain and Ireland are retained, thearrangements for the control of telephone calls between the two countries shouldcontinue. The difficulty is that the arrangements for reversion to the pre-&apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; position in the case of Irish travel involve a method of announcement which conceals what is in effect being done. No such concealmentwill be possible in the case of a reversion to the pre-&quot; Overlord &quot; position asregards the control of telephone traffic.The General Post Office and the Postal and Telegraph Censorship could not agree to the indefinite extension of these restrictions on telephone calls, and they felt that, once the restrictions on Irish travel had been lifted, the announcementof the removal of the telephone restrictions could not be long delayed.S.H.A.E.F. were prepared to agree to an announcement that the restrictionson telephone calls to and from Ireland had been removed, on condition that it wassuitably timed (see Section VI below).VI. -Timing.S.H.A.E.F. explained that at present the state of the &quot; cover &quot; plan was such that any plain announcement about the relaxation of security restrictions was bound to have a very serious effect. Arrangements were, however, in hand whichwould build the plan up to a new peak, to be reached on or about 15th August;and they therefore recommended that the announcements about the restoration of telephone facilities and the Aer Lingus Teoranta service should appear about that time, when they would do little damage and might even be used to help the &apos;&apos; cover &apos;&apos; plan.******
VII. Summary of Recommendations.It is therefore recommended : *****(ii) That the visitors&apos; ban in the coastal area from the Wash to Southamptonshould be continued for a further period (say one month), notwith-standing the impossibility of making additions to the permittedclasses without publicity; and that S.H.A.E.F. should keep the matter under constant review, so that the ban might be lifted as soon as itceases to play a vital part in the success of the &quot; cover &quot; plan.4t* ^ff&apos;(iv) That on or about 15th August the Eire authorities should be informed by the Dominions Office that the Aer Lingus Teoranta service mightbe reintroduced.(v) That on or about 15th August the General Post Office should announce the removal of the special restrictions on telephone calls betweenGreat Britain and Ireland,(vi) That the future of the Swedish A.B. Aero Transport service should besettled by inter-Departmental discussion.Home Defence Executive,Norfolk House,St. James&apos;s Square, S.W. 1,1st August, 1944.
