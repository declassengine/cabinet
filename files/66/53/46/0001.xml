THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.Copy No.WAR CABINET.RELIEF OF OCCUPIED EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 3rd May, 1943 (W.M. 63 (43), Minute 5), the War Cabinet rejected a proposal that a limited quantity of food should be allowed to pass throughthe blockade for the relief mainly of children in enemy-occupied territory. no concession in regard to relief from overseas has been made beyond the regularshipments to Greece authorised in February 1942.2. Pressure from political groups in the United States, and to a lesser extent in this country, has continued and the American Government havefrequently pressed us on the subject. During his recent visit to Washingtonthe Parliamentary Secretary to M.E.W. discussed a proposal that relief from within the blockade area should be permitted to go to certain internment campsto be selected by the International Red Cross. It was hoped that this proposal would go some way to meet the humanitarians and would be sufficient to preventthe American Government from persisting in their desire to allow relief topass through the blockade. This hope, however, has not been fulfilled, for theAmerican Ambassador came to see me on the 19th July and left with me aletter which he had received from Mr. Hull, making the suggestion that a joint anglo-American Committee should be formed to sit in London to examine thepossibility of providing limited amounts of food-stuffs for distribution to children, nursing and expectant mothers through the International Red Cross.In leaving this note with me the Ambassador said that he hoped I wTould bearin mind that the matter was a &quot; political issue at home.&quot; I attach as an Annexa copy of Mr. HuITs letter.3. My colleagues will be aware that on the 30th June, the Belgian,Netherlands and Norwegian Ambassadors and the representative of the french committee of National Liberation called on me and handed me a memorandumadvocating a limited relief scheme based on the well-known Kershner ReliefPlan, and informed me that a similar demarche was being made to Mr. Hullin Washington. The new scheme involves sending about 20,000 tons of food-stuffs a month from the United States, and finding some 60,000 tons of shipping.4. Our experience in setting up the Greek relief scheme shows that it requires at least four months for examination, agreement by the enemy, and planning, before any action can be taken, and consideration of any generalrelief scheme for Europe would clearly take just as long. The military situationis so satisfactory that it appears probable that we should never be called upon togive effect to any scheme. On the other hand, the fact that we and the americans had set up a committee to examine this question would go a long way to satisfy the humanitarians in both countries, and is indeed all that Mr. Hull now asksus to do. Consequently I ask the Cabinet to authorise me to return a favourablereply to Mr. hull&apos;s  letter and agree to his proposal to set up an Anglo-american committee in London to draw up a scheme for submission to our respective governments.A.

Letter- from Mr. Hull to the United States Ambassador.(No. 4257.) Department of State, Washington.Sir, July 1, 1944.Reference is made to the Departments telegram No. 4257, May 27, to the embassy&apos;s telegrams 4487, June 3. and 4568, June 7, and to the Departmentstelegram 4634, June 10, concerning the desire of the Government of the UnitedStates to arrange, if possible, for limited feeding programs through the Inter-national Red Cross in accessible enemy-occupied territory in Europe.Discussions have been held with Mr. Dingle M. Eoot during his visit in washington on the various phases of the question of relief operations in occupiedEurope. There is enclosed for the Embassy&apos;s information a copy of a memorandumdated June 12, 1944,(&apos;) which outlines the points agreed upon in discussions withMr. Foot. (A separate instruction is being sent to the Embassy in regard tothe measures covered in the memorandum). Mr. Foot stated, however, that he wasnot authorized to enter into any arrangements in behalf of the British Govern-ment which would go beyond the position heretofore taken by the british authorities on the question of relief to persons at liberty in the occupied countries.In Mr. Foots letter to Mr. Berle of June 13, a copy of which is enclosed^1) it isstated that the measures mentioned therein are without prejudice to such further measures as may be agreed to subsequently by the two Governments. It willbe noted from Mr. Berle&apos;s reply elated June 14, a copy of which is also enclosed,(*)that this Government intends to continue its efforts to arrange for limited civilianrelief programs.The Department desires that discussions on the proposal set forth in theDepartments telegram 4257, May 27, be re-opened in London. In this connectionand with reference to the Embassy&apos;s telegram 4568, June 7, the Department would prefer that this question not be submitted at this time to the Combined Chiefsof Staff. The Department questions whether limited programs of this naturerequire submission to and approval by the Combined Chiefs of Staff but in anycase it is of the opinion that agreement in regard thereto in principle should first be reached by the civilian authorities of both Governments. If those authorities of the two Governments are agreed that an effort should be made to put intoeffect limited programs of this nature, the Department would propose at thattime that the matter be brought to the attention of the Combined Chiefs of staff and their approval requested.It is quite apparent, in view of the position taken by the British authorities onthis question, that it would be a waste of time to carry- on further discussions onany but the highest possible political level The Department suggests that a specialcommittee be set up in London for the purpose of examining the proposal under reference. Composition of the American section of the committee would, of course,be left to your discretion. It is. however, recommended that you participatepersonally in these discussions thereby emphasizing the high importance which,this Government attaches to the matter. The Department would like to havethese discussions carrried on with officials of the British Government of similarlyimportant position. The Department does not believe that this matter can be resolved satisfactorily through discussions by the Relief Sub-Committee.In view of the limitations on Mr. Foots authority as noted above, thisproposal was not discussed with him at great length. The Department is confi-dent, however, that he became aware of the importance which this Governmentattaches to it. In these conversations some indication was given as to theobjections which the British Government may interpose. For your assistancein carrying on the discussion there are noted below several of the points whichthe British Government may raise together with the comments which the Depart-ment suggests might be made in regard to them.1. That in view of recent military developments and those which mayr beexpected as operations continue in Europe, it would not be feasible to transportsupplies either by sea or overland, after arrival, to distribution points.The pending proposal provides for limited shipments of foodstuffs in theneutral ships now carrying prisoner of war relief supplies to Marseilles. Thesefoodstuffs would be intended for distribution in southern France. Similar ship-ments could be made in the Swedish safe conduct vessels for distribution in norway.   Therefore, no additional operational difficulties would be created by(*) Not printed.
reason of these shipments. As regards overland transportation, that would, of necessity, depend on the military situation. It is not expected, however, to carryon relief operations in areas of active military operations. It would not beexpected that military operations would in any sense be subordinated to thecontinued shipment of supplies either by sea or overland.2. That this proposal, providing for distribution by the International red cross, would be looked upon as having been made in bad faith since we haveheretofore refused to permit distribution through the International Red Cross.Prior to the landing of Allied forces in Europe this Government had hoped to put into effect a more far-reaching program of relief, which might have been set up in all the occupied countries under the supervision of a neutral Govern-ment. That proposal was set forth in the Departments A^ll, March 16.The pending proposal offers the possibility of extending aid within the limitations imposed by recent military developments. The realities of the situation must,of course, govern our actions. It could hardly be taken as bad faith, however,to endeavour to do what the realities permit.3. That such a program would raise false hopes in the hearts of people in those occupied areas which we could not hope to reach immediately.The people in the occupied areas can be depended upon to realise that our efforts to assist them are limited by the realities of the situation. At the presenttime we could not hope to send food direct to Belgium, the Netherlands or to alarge part of occupied France. Overland transport to areas remote from portspresently outside the zones of active military operations would be out of thequestion, immediately, for obvious reasons. We can, however, do what thecircumstances permit, thus giving some assistance where it is possible to do soeven if it is not practicable to reach all the areas we would like to reach. Ifpromises are not made which we cannot expect to carry out, false hopes shouldnot be raised. We would propose to state frankly that, until the occupied areas are liberated, we can hope to extend relief only in those areas where military considerations permit.4. Mr. Foot made passing reference to the possibility of the pending-proposal appearing insincere.It was not entirely clear what he had in mind in making this observation.However, should such an argument be raised it might be pointed out that boththe Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have madefrequent protestations of their sympathy for the plight of the civilian populations of the occupied areas and of their desire to be of assistance to them if possible.We are more exposed to a charge of insincerity by reason of our failure-to attemptto bring aid to these people than by actually making an effort to do what can bedone in the circumstances. Only by making the effort can we demonstrate the sincerity of the frequent statements which have been made by both governments in this connection.5. It is apparent that M.E.W. hopes to hold the line at the present point,that is, with the blockade concessions in respect to refugee and concentrationcamps and the increased despatch of food from neutral countries to occupiedareas. M.E.W. appears to believe that, if the public is informed of these measuresplus the child evacuation schemes, pressure for further concessions will be considerably reduced. In all probability M.E.W. will propose that the pending-proposal be held in abeyance until public reaction to such a statement can beevaluated.The Department, of course, is not in a position to predict the reaction of theBritish public. It is confident, however, that the reaction of the American public will be that the blockade concession in respect of refugee and concentration campsproves the feasibility of attempting on a limited scale to ameliorate the sufferingof women and children where they can be reached. This would be predicated onthe assumption that if the International Red Cross can safeguard distribution ofsupplies to persons in refugee and concentration camps, the special objects of themost brutal German oppressive measures, there would be far less danger of inter-ference with freedom of action on the part of the International Red Cross and less likelihood of confiscation of imported supplies in connection with limitedprograms for women and children.The Department offers also for your guidance and assistance the following-general comments which may be helpful to you in these discussions.The proposal under reference provides only for limited amounts of foodstuffssuitable for distribution to children, nursing and expectant mothers, that segment
of the population which is of least assistance to the German war effort and in whose welfare the Germans have the least interest for that reason. We arealready entrusting to the International Red Cross the distribution of foodstuffssent into occupied areas from neutral countries. As will be noted from the memo-randum of June 12 we have now agreed to permit fairly sizable shipments of foodstuffs and perhaps clothing into occupied territory for distribution by theInternational Red Cross in refugee and concentration camps. The pending-proposal is&quot; merely a limited extension of the blockade concessions already made and is designed to benefit those groups in whom we have an especial interest andfor whom nothing substantial has yet been done. It would be inconsistent to entrust the distribution of relief supplies to the International Red Cross to persons in refugee and concentration camps and to refuse similarly to entrust theInternational Red Cross with the distribution of relief on a limited basis to thisother segmet of the population.Should the European war carry over into its sixth winter, public demand inthe United States, and presumably in Great Britain also, in favor of reliefprograms in occupied Allied territory particularly for women and children will reach tremendous proportions. While we hope, of course, that none of the occupied Allied countries will have to endure a sixth winter of war, it is apossibility that cannot safely be ruled out of consideration. If the experimentenvisaged in the pending proposal should prove successful and the war were pro-longed, experience would have been gained which would be useful in connectionwith any possible extension of the programs that might then seem advisable.Should the experiment fail and it be proved by experience that programs of this nature cannot be carried out satisfactorily in German-dominated areas, both governments would have a sound basis for refusing to accede to public demand that further food shipments be made despite suffering, real or presumed, behind the German lines.The weakness of the Anglo-American position in this regard is and alwayshas been&apos; that we have never tried to put into effect a relief program for persons at liberty in the occupied territories. Public opinion in the United States willnot remain satisfied with vague statements that military considerations precluderelief operations in all areas under German domination (except Greece). Publicopinion in this country demands that an attempt be made. Should the attemptprove unsuccessful, it is believed that the greater part of public opinion will besatisfied and will make the best of the situation. American public opinion willnot be satisfied otherwise.In addition to the humanitarian considerations involved, this question isassuming considerable proportions as a domestic political issue. Both Houses of congress have gone on record, unanimously, as favoring the inauguration of limited feeding programs in the occupied Allied countries where possible in thelight of military consideration. The Department is of the opinion that thepending proposal offers a formula under which a bona fide effort in this directioncan be made without adversely affecting the Allied Avar effort. It is hoped thatupon reconsideration and in the light of the foregoing considerations, the BritishGovernment will agree to authorize the International Red Cross to approach theGerman Government in the sense suggested in the pending proposal.The Department hopes that these discussions can be opened immediately, andthat the matter will be pressed vigorously to a successful conclusion. Please keepthe Department currently informed of the progress of these discussions.The Foreign Economic Administration concurs in the foregoing, and theBritish Embassy at Washington has been informed that the Department issuggesting the resumption of these discussions in London.Very truly yours,(Sd.) CORDELL HULL.
