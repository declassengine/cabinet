That, however, is not the purpose of thepresent enquiry.  May I remind my colleagues of its origin.2. Over a year ago I wrote* that the two-stage ending of the war wouldinvolve the release for civilian purposes of some portion of the resources now engaged in war production. The present survey is the result of the work thusset in hand. If the Civil Departments are to make sound plans for the speedyturnover of a proportion of our industry from war to peace production, theymust now be given without delay an indication in broad terms as to the amountof additional man-power and capacity which will be available in Stage II.3. Likewise, discussions are due to be undertaken with the Americans onLend-Lease supplies in the near future. These discussions must take place onthe basis of clear assumptions as to the size of the forces which we hope to deployin Stage II.4. There are, of course, many important questions connected with ourstrategy in the war against Japan, and our policy in Europe, which must be resolved before any final statement can be laid down of the strength of our Armed* W.P.

Forces one year after Germany&apos;s defeat. These matters will be pursued to closerapproximations from time to time.5. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that we should now endeavour to arrive atsome general basis which will enable all Departments, Service and Civil, to proceedwith plans with the assurance that these plans will not later be found to be whollyimpracticable on the grounds of man-power, and have to be discarded and framedanew. To postpone any decision, because we cannot attain exactitude, would destroy the chance of a smooth and effective redistribution of our resources when germany has been defeated.6. I ask my colleagues to bear in mind this general approach in consideringthe suggestions which follow.II.7. &quot;We are given to understand that the total supply of labour will fall shortby If millions of the total of the various civil and military requirements whichhave been framed. It would be impossible at this stage to settle exactly how thisdeficit is to be met. but it is clear at any rate that military requirements mustbe cut. For the present I should like to see the effect worked out of a cut of1.100.000 on Service and munitions requirements.8. This cut would still leave a deficit of nearly 1 million. We shall haveto decide later how far it will be necessary to impose further cuts on militarydemands, and how far the deficit can be met by reducing civil requirements, or by increasing the supply of man-power [e.g., by postponing the raising of the school-leaving age or persuading women to remain an extra year in industry). In the meanwhile, I suggest that a further scrutiny of civilian claims should be madewith a view to reducing their total by, say, 200,000.9. In deciding how man-power available for civil purposes should be provisionally allocated. I suggest (a) that the restoration of the export trade should have first priority;(b) that it should be laid down that we cannot afford to fall short of the tentative provision made for the first year of the building programme;(c) that we must do what we can to restore other civil standards where theshoe pinches; but that this stands in lower priority than (a) or (&amp;).10. In the military field, it would be sufficient, for our immediate purpose,if wTe say that plans should be based on a cut in the total Service man-power of700.000 leaving 400.000 to be found by reductions in the output of munitions.As time goes on. it may be found that these figures must be varied one way or theother, and the detailed incidence of the cuts will require to be investigated.   In
the meanwhile, I should like to see the effect of these cuts worked out on thefollowing broad lines:-Royal Navy. 1Ji-11. Having regard to the overpowering Naval force which will be availablefor the war against Japan. I consider that the Navy should bear a cut of at least200.000 men.   The principles on which this should be worked out are : (a) That only ships of the highest quality should be retained in active service.(b) That there can be some reduction in the Fleet Air Arm. in view of the overwhelming Air effort which will be concentrated against Japan.Above all. however, intense efforts should be made to reduce the Navy ashoreall over the world, which is out of proportion to the size of the Fleet wrhich willengage the enemy., ^ IV.A rmy.12. We do not know how our commitments for the occupation of europe will work out in detail. The Chiefs of Staff have suggested a figure of 434,000men to cover all these commitments. I consider that we should now plan on theassumption that by the end of one year after the defeat of Germany the Britishtotal could be reduced by 140,000. This reduction should be facilitated by thegreater use of Allied contingents.13. It is proposed to deploy 822,000 men in the war against Japan. this figure should be cut down by 80,000. Bases in Australia will probably not be-required, and though some of the men earmarked for this purpose will be wantedelsewhere, a greater use of Indian man-power and of prisoners-of-war should enable this &quot;deduction to be made without materially diminishing the strikingpower of the Army against Japan.14. A further 80,000 men should be cut by a general pruning of commit-nients all over the world, including the United Kingdom. The total reductionproposed for the Army is thus 300,000.R.A.F. V15. An immense American Air Force will be deployed against Japan.Nevertheless, I observe that it is proposed to bring into action a force of 59 Britishheavy bomber squadrons, or 1,180 first-line aircraft. I can see no possibility ofsuch a force being deployed, and I do not consider that we should make plans for more than 40 squadrons at the outside. Other reductions must also be madein the total of 282 R.A.F. Squadrons which we are asked to maintain, and whichwill only with the greatest difficulty be brought to bear on the enemy. I proposea total cut of 200,000 in the B.A.F. man-power.16. I shall be happy to study the military proposals further with the Chiefsof Staff when they have had time to study the effects of the figures set out above.W. S. C.
