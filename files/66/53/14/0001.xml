THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1944.secret.P. (44) 414.26th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.FOREIGN POLICY AND THE FLYING BOMB.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council and Deputy PrimeMinister.THE advent of the flying bomb and the possible arrival in the near futureof the long-range rocket have far-reaching implications in the field of foreignpolicy.2. In the period between the world wars there was a reluctance to acceptthe logical consequences of the development of three dimensional warfare. Theopinion was held in many quarters that Britain had a choice as to whether she should embroil herself in the affairs of the Continent or, turning her back onEurope, should look to the Empire. The effect of this opinion wras to make Britainunwilling to commit herself to a system of collective security or even to makeany binding engagements to take action against aggression. It was held thatthis was contrary to our tradition. A striking example of this habit of mind inaction was the rejection after the 1924 election of the Geneva Protocol.3. The belief in the defensive strength of &quot; our moat,&quot; the Channel, wasparalleled in France by faith in the Maginot line. Experience should have taughtthat both could be overleapt. We saved ourselves from the consequences withgreat difficulty and hazard in 1940. But the fact of the proximity of london to hostile air bases as compared with the remoteness of Berlin put Britain at aserious disadvantage only overcome by our technical superiority in aircraft and ancillary contrivances.4. As a small island with its most vulnerable point, a city of 8 millioninhabitants, close to the Continent, we ought to have organised the defence ofEurope with a view to its protection.5. The answer, if any, to the Flying Bomb and the rocket has not yet beenfound, but it is obvious that we cannot now afford to be indifferent to the political position of the countries from which these weapons can be launched. We mustdeny access to the nearer sites and gain space for dealing with those launchedat a longer range. The holder of Northern France and the Low Countries canplace there secretly a weapon with which to hold us to ransom.6. Therefore we have no choice in the matter. We are not a semi-detachedcountry, free if we will to turn our backs on Europe and look towards the atlantic, but a continental Power with a vulnerable land frontier.7. The proposition that the defence of Britain could only be effected by asystem of collective security involving definite military commitments was putforward very often by myself on behalf of the Labour Party and by individual members of other Parties in debates in Parliament, but was rejected by thosewho thought that security could be obtained in isolation. I claim that eventshave shown that those who advocated collective security were right, and thatthe emergence of the new method of attack by long-range bombardment isconclusive.8.   It follows from this reasoning that we cannot afford to have as a bufferbetween us and a potential enemy a ring of weak neutral States liable quicklyto be overrun.   We must not only disarm Germany and keep her disarmed, but[27894]Copy No.
we must build a system of defence which will deny to a potential enemy theopportunity of securing bases for launching attacks upon us and will afford uspositions from which we can make provision for a counter-threat.9. From our own point of view Norway, Denmark, Holland and France arenecessary outposts of Britain and, inasmuch as Britain is nowr as she has been for a hundred years a shield for the United States, outposts of America as well.Their defence is necessary to our defence and without us they cannot defend themselves. They also afford the advanced posts not only to break the enemy&apos;attack, but from which to attack him.10. We hope to build up a world organisation for peace. We are basingit upon the firm alliance of the three Great Powers : Britain, the United Statesand the U.S.S.R. The potential strength of Britain is her leadership of theBritish Commonwealth and Empire. The weakness of the British Commonwealthis&quot; that her vital point is thrust out within range of possible enemies. Unless weare prepared to shift the centre of the Commonwealth we must ensure that it isin a strategical position comparable to that of Washington and Moscow. Wecan only do this by bringing into the closest association with ourselves the countrieswhich hold the keys of our fortress.11. I hold, therefore, that within a general system of collective securitythere should be a close military alliance between Britain and the States above mentioned and that our post-Avar defence provision should be based on this.I do not think that such an organisation will be viewed with suspicion by Russia.With characteristic realism the Russians after the revolution removed their capital from vulnerable Leningrad to Moscowt, and later their industries fromthe West to the Urals. Stalin is now engaged in Finland and the Baltic states in doing for Leningrad what we must do for London. He will recognise the logicof the position, although our methods are not his.12. .1 think that the bitter experience of the past four years has weanedthe West European States from a belief in neutrality which in practice only means that they provide the battleground for the Great Powers. I believe that theywould welcome a military alliance of the kind indicated and would make their contribution.13. If the reasoning in this Paper is correct, it should be taken into account in our post-hostilities planning.C. R. A.Privy Council Offices, S.W. 1,26^ July, 1944.
