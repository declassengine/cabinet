DRAFT REPLY TO MR.  GA&quot;Q-:DHI AS FURTHERMENDED BY INDIA COMMITTEE ON hTH AUGUST*1.        Following is text of draft reply to Gandhi.Begins:        Thank you for your letter of 27th July.Your proposal&apos; is :-(i) That you should undertake&apos;to advise theWorking Committee (a)  &quot;that in view ofchanged conditions mass civil disobedienceenvisaged by the resolution of August 1942cannot be offered,&quot; and (b) &quot;that full co-operation in war effort should he given by congress,&quot; provided -(ii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should (a) declareimmediate Indian Independence,  and (b) forma &quot;National Government&quot; responsible to central Assembly,      &quot;subject to proviso that,during pendency of war military operations should continue as at present but without involving any financial burden on India.&quot;2.Suchquite un-proposals are ie-fte%    acceptable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as a basis for discussion.and you mustrealise this if you have read Mr. Amery&apos;s statenientin the House of Commons on 26th July last.      They areindeed -Efc-ae very similar to the proposal made byMaulana Abdul Kalam Azad to Sir Stafford Cripps in

April, 19^2, and His Majesty&apos;s Government1sreasons for rejecting i^fe them are the same as theywere then.3.       Without recapitulating all these reasons indetail I should remind you that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at that time made it clear (a) that their offer of ee&apos;ffigiefce-aft&amp;-HHeua3ri ieei: freedom after the cessation of hostilities was made conditional upon theframing of a Constitution agreed &quot;by the main elements of India&apos;s    national life and. the negotiation of thenecessary treaty arrangements with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.      (b) that it wae is impossible duringthe period of. hostilities to bring about any changein the Constitutions by which means alone a &quot;national government&quot;, such as you suggest,  could be made responsible to the Central Assembly,h.        It was upon the above conditions that HisMajesty&apos;s Government invited the Indian leaders totake part in an interim government, which would operate under the existing Constitution.      I must make it quite clear that until the -war is over the responsibility-responsibility for defence and. military operations cannotbe divided ewfe from the other responsibilities of theGovernment, and that until hostilities cease, and thenew Constitution is in operation, His Majesty&apos;aGovernment and the Governor General must retain their responsibility over

the entire field&apos;.      So far as the questionof Indiafs share of the cost of the waris concerned,   this Is essentially a matter for settlement between Eis Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on the one hand and the Government ofIndia on the other,   and existing arrange-ments can only be re-opened at the instanceof one or other of those governments.5* Your present proposal is consequentlynot one-which I could recommend for theacceptance of His Majesty&apos;s Government.would, therefore,  beNo purposeserved bydiscussion on that basis.     At the sametime His Majesty&apos;s Government ape most anxious that a settlement of the Indianproblem should be reached.Not new paragraph If the leaders of Hindus, Moslems andthe important minorities were willing to co-operate in a transitional government established and working within the presentgoodconstitution,  I believeprogress might be made.     For such a transitionalgovernment to succeed there must,  before it is formed, be agreement in principle between

Hindus and Moslems and the important minorities as to themethod by which the now Constitution should he framed.      Thisagreement is a matter for Indians themselves.Until the Indian leaders have comecloser together than they are now, I doubt if I myself can doLot me remind you, too, thatminority problems are not easy.     The;/ are real, and can be solved only by mutual compromise and tolerance.    Sndian6r. The period after the termination of hostilities for whichthe transitional Government would last would depend on the speed with which the new Constitution could be framed, I see no reason why preliminary work on that Constitution should notbegin as soon as the Indian Leaders are prepared to co-operate to that end. If they can arrive at a genuine agreement asto the method of framing the Constitution,no unnecessary time need bo spent afterthe war in reaching final conclusions and  ea? in agreeingtreaty arrangements with His Majesty&apos;sThere again the primary responsibility rests on the Indian Loaders.-k-Governmentanything to help.
