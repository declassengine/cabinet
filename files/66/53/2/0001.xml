THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1944.-----sf-SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (44) 402.22nd July, 1944.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE 1944 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.THE possibility that the life of the Canadian Parliament might be extendedwas definitely ruled out by Mr. Mackenzie King announcing to the Commons thatthe House would be dissolved and an election held before the 1st July, 1945.There has subsequently been further political manoeuvring and Mr. Tim Buck,leader of the Labour-Progressives (Communists), who some time ago endeavouredunsuccessfully to persuade the C.C.F. to co-operate with his party, is nowapproaching the Liberals with the aim of forming a Liberal-Labour Coalition.The Liberal Party has stated that it is in favour of co-operation but notcoalition.2. The Premier of Quebec, M. Godbout, has announced that the QuebecProvincial General Election will be held on the 8th August. The Liberal Govern-ment seems confident of being returned to office, although the question of reinforcements for the Army, which has now been raised by the Federal Govern-ment with Quebec, is a thorny point that may recoil on the heads of the LiberalAdministration.3. In a maiden speech in the Senate, Senator D. T. Bouchard, a formerMinister of the Quebec Government, asserted that a secret organisation knownas the Order of Jacques Cartier was deliberately engaged in disturbing relationsbetween England and French-speaking Canadians. It was alleged that some ofits members dreamed of a French Canadian Catholic nation being established onthe shores of the St. Lawrence and were building up a false political philosophyby the teaching of distorted history. The Premier of Quebec has since announcedthat Senator Bouchard has been relieved of his duties as Chairman of the QuebecProvincial Hydro-Electric Commission.4. One of the Canadian Government^ most serious problems at the moment is the acute shortage of man-power. Major Triquet, who was recently awardedthe Victoria Cross, together with the deputy adjutant-general in charge of recruiting, has urged the Home Defence Army to volunteer for oversea services,and this has given rise to criticism. On the other hand, demands are being madefor the passing of an Order in Council making the Home Defence Army com-pnlsorily available for oversea service.5. After a prolonged debate the War Appropriation Bill has been passedauthorising an expenditure of $3,650 million for war purposes in the presentfiscal year.6. The new Mutual Aid Bill which now covers Canada&apos;s contribution of$77 million to U.N.R.R.A., was passed after only two days&apos; debate and was muchmore favourably received than had been expected.[27866] B
7. After some delay the Government is now bringing forward the measuresby which it proposes to implement the ambitious post-war domestic programmeforeshadowed in the Speech from the Throne. The BilJ for the establishment ofa Department to deal with the care, training or re-establishment of members ofthe Armed Forces has passed its third reading. Mr. Mackenzie King has movedthe second reading of the Bill to establish a Department to formulate and carryout reconstruction plans.8. Mr. Coldwell, Leader of the C.C.F., has urged that Canada must seekmembership in the Pan-American Union, and press for the creation of CanadianEmbassies in as many of the Latin American States as are prepared to receive them.Service A activities.9. Destroyers and minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy took part inthe landing operations on the Normandy coast; the destroyers includedChaudiere, Kootenay, Ottawa, Skeena, Gatineau, Resticjouche, Saskatchewan,Qu&apos;&apos;Ayypelle and St. Lawent.10. On the night of the 8th/9th H.M.C. destroyers Huron and Haida, in company with four other destroyers, intercepted three German Narvik- and oneElbing-class destroyers off Northern Brittany. Two of the enemy ships were sunk,the others escaped to the westward. On the 24th H.M.C.S. Haida, in company with H.M. destroyer Eskimo, sank a U-boat off Start Point. On the night of the27th/28th H.M.C.S. Huron sank two trawlers N.W. of St. Malo. On the 29thH.M. Canadian Frigate Colbome was damaged while on anti-submarine patrolsouth-east of Portland.11. The Third Canadian Division (Major-General R. F. L. Keller) and theSecond Canadian Armoured Brigade (Brigadier N. A. Gianelli) formed part ofthe Eastern (British) Task Force which started landing in Normandy on the 6th.Casualties in the initial landings were light, but both Canadian formations have since been involved in heavy fighting in the area N.W. and W. of Caen.12. The Canadian forces advancing in Italy had reached Frosinone at theend of May and during the first part of June they continued their advance ina north-westerly direction along Highway 6 through Ferentino towardsValmontone. At this stage the Germans, after the fall of Rome, started a rapidretreat northwards and henceforward the pursuit in this sector of the line wastaken up by one United Kingdom Armoured Division and the South AfricanArmoured Division.13. No. 6 (R.C.A.F.) Bomber Group completed a monthly record of2,812 sorties comprising 13,350 operational hours; 45 bombers failed to return from these operations. On the 15th the Group successfully carried out their firstdaylight operation. Main objectives were Flying-Bomb bases in the Pas deCalais, marshalling yards, factories, road and railway communications andtactical targets in support of our ground forces in Normandy. The only operation against Germany was one attack on Duisburg.14. Canadian squadrons of Coastal Command also largely increased thescale of their operations, flying 741 sorties totalling 4,304 operational hours; four aircraft are missing from these operations. German losses inflicted include two destroyers sunk, one destroyer and a minesweeper set pn fire, two minesweepersand two tankers hit and left smoking, besides many other minesweepers, E-boats and R-boats claimed as damaged.15. Canadian squadrons of Air Defence, Great Britain, were also active,flying 1,397 sorties as compared with 899 in May; ten aircraft were reported missing. Thirty-seven German aircraft and 21 Flying-Bombs were shot downand several units of motor transport and locomotives damaged.16. R.C.A.F. Sector, Wing Headquarters and Squadrons of the SecondTactical Air Force, with the exception of No. 39 R.C.A.F. (Reconnaissance) Wing,moved to landing strips in Normandy.17. No. 413 Squadron, Ceylon, carried out routine operations without incident and all aircraft of this squadron returned safely. No. 417 SpitfireSquadron in Italy flew 202 sorties and lost one aircraft.
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.18. The Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin, received a warm welcome when he returned to Australia at the end of June after having visited Canada and theUnited States.19. It has been announced that the Federal Referendum on the Bill toprovide wider constitutional powers for the Commonwealth for post-war reconstruction will be held on the 19th August. Provision is being made to record the votes of all servicemen and servicewomen throughout Australia and abroad.At the Conference of the United Australia Party, Parliamentary leaders and party Office bearers resolved that the Party would do everything possible to defeat the Referendum. It is generally thought that the Government will not obtain an affirmative vote as recent actions, e.g., in the matter of censorship as described in paragraph 16 of the report for April, have made the country wary of allowing the Government too much power.20. Speaking at the Trade Union Conference, Mr. Forde, Minister for theArmy, said that unless the Commonwealth received the additional powers sought in the coming Referendum, Australia faced the risk of a recurrence of a shortboom and a long depression such as followed the last war.21. The full High Court at Melbourne unanimously upheld the validity ofthe Regulation empowering the man-power authorities to direct persons to workfor private employers, thus setting aside the judgment of the New South WalesSupreme Court, which had declared the Regulation invalid.22. With the disclosure of the extent of Censorship of internal mail and theuse to which information has been put, there has been another outburst of criticism of the whole question of Censorship, together with allegations that theMinister for Information, Mr. Calwell, has tried unsuccessfully to persuade theFederal Cabinet to embark on a war against the Press by strictly repressivemeasures.23. The Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin, stated in a speech to the national press Club in Washington that 95 per cent, of the food needed by United states forces in the South-West Pacific is supplied by Australia under ReciprocalLend-Lease.24. The weekly butter ration was reduced from 8 to 6 ounces for an eight-weekly period from the 5th June. This has not been well received by the miners,who during the last month have been on strike at a number of mines. Mr. Fordeand also Mr. Collingridge, M.P., a member of the Empire ParliamentaryAssociation Delegation to Australia, have addressed the miners, but strikescontinue. It was reported, and then subsequently denied, that Mr. Forde was preparing to introduce conscription for the mines as in Britain.25. In order that full plans for demobilisation may proceed, the WarCabinet has made a decision on the order in which the fighting forces will be demobilised at the end of the war and also on the discharge rate which is to be aimed at.26. Thirteen Members of the United Kingdom and Canadian Parliamentsarrived on the 4th June for a six weeks&apos; tour of Australia.27. The Government of India has selected Sir Raghunath Paranjpje for appointment as first High Commissioner for India in the Commonwealth ofAustralia.Service A activities.28. The Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army, General Sir ThomasBlarney, G.B.E., K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., returning from the meetings of PrimeMinisters in London, arrived at Brisbane on the 22nd after visiting Australianforces in New Guinea on his return journey.29. From the 1st November, 1943, to the 24th June, 1944, 18,786 army personnel had been released to rural industry out of the 20,000 total decided upon.30.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Commander-in-Chiefof the Australian Army arranged recently to exchange a small number of Grade IIStaff Officers between the British and Australian armies for a period of one year&apos; [27866] . B 2
or longer if required. Arrangements are now in progress to send to the UnitedKingdom six Australian officers in the near future and three others later. Acorresponding party of British officers is expected in Australia subsequently.31. Major-General A. C. Richardson and Major G. A. Harford arrived inAustralia from India during the month to investigate and report on all matters affecting the development, production and tactical use of armoured vehicles.32. With the approval of the Commander-in-Chief, arrangements are inprogress to establish in England an organisation to receive Australian prisonersof war now held in Europe; for this purpose about 50 officers and 100 other ranksare now in course of leaving Australia.NEW ZEALAND.33. On his return journey to New Zealand from the United kingdom mr. Fraser, the Prime Minister, accompanied by Mrs. Fraser and members ofhis staff, paid a brief visit to Canada where he was given a very warmreception. Mr. Fraser, in his address to a joint session of the Senate andthe House of Commons, where he received an enthusiastic welcome, paidtribute to Canada&apos;s war effort. In a press interview he said that he favoured the United Kingdom being on the permanent council of an international organisa-tion because she was &quot; the centre of the Commonwealth edifice,&quot; but stressed his view that the British Commonwealth should not be represented by only one voiceor act as a unit in any international organisation. At the same time he supported the view that organisation for security must be on a world basis, rejecting&quot; regional security &quot; as a mirage. He also expressed the hope that there wouldbe a Commonwealth air line in the Pacific in the future. He made a point at thePress Conference of stressing the identity of view between himself andMr. Mackenzie King. He subsequently paid a visit to stay with president roosevelt at Hyde Park.34. The Australian Minister of Trade and Customs has paid a visit to new Zealand to examine her &quot;achievements in housing, social services, price stabilisation, liquor control and aspects of lend-lease.&quot; This visit has been welcomed as an example of the &quot; get together movement.&quot;Service A activities.35.   The Shelly Bay Naval Base was commissioned on the 1st June.36. H.M.N.Z. corvette Arbutus has completed to full complement and isnow working up at Stornoway.37. The New Zealand Division in Italy reached Sora on the 1st of the month.Their further advance northwards was slow on account of demolitions, but wasaided to some extent by a small party of parachutists who were dropped ahead of their line of advance to hamper enemy opposition.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.38. At the Cape Congress of the United Party at Port Elizabeth, SenatorConroy, who is Minister of Lands, made a speech deploring the rivalry that hasnow developed over the appointment of the next Prime Minister, which wasthreatening to shake the United Party. He alleged that a growing section of theEnglish-speaking members of the Party were turning to Mr. Havenga as a possibleleader. Mr. Havenga has denied this and declared that, if he ever returned to political life it would be solely to promote a party of Nationalist sympathies.The Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Hofmeyr, who also spoke at the Congress,warned the Party not to be too complacent, as the accession to power of theirNationalist opponents would be charged with the gravest danger to South Africa.39. The Wakkerstroom by-election result has greatly increased the prestige of the Nationalist Party, which is now trying to raise a fund of  100,000 to finance republican campaigns and to found English medium organs on the Randand in Cape Town for appeal to the English-speaking section.40. There is increasing agitation among the Europeans in Durban againstthe Draft Ordinance, which provides for the establishment in Durban of a board to control the occupation of property by Indians. The Board is to consist of five members three Europeans, one of whom must be a lawyer and will be the Chair-man, and two Indians.   The Board will have discretion to grant or refuse
applications and occupiers&apos; licences, subject to the right of appeal to the administrator. Criticism is being made against General Smuts and the united party, and the Nationalists are openly rejoicing in the trend of opinion in Natal,where Volksblad comments that the &quot;Little England&quot; of South Africa is beginning to realise that General Smuts is intending to sacrifice its interests tothose of Britain&apos;s Imperial Policy and is consequently being provoked into show-ing a Nationalistic and South African attitude. Support for the Ordinance hascome from Mr. Heaton Nicholls, the Administrator, in the Natal ProvincialCouncil. Meanwhile a Judicial Commission to enquire into the amenities avail-able for Indians has begun its sittings.41. The Minister for Native Affairs, Major van der Byl, has outlined hisscheme for the reclamation of the Native reserves&apos;. It is proposed to set up in eachof the four main native areas, Ciskei, Transkei, Natal and the Northern Provinces,and the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, specialised control committees,each of which will have as an Administrator the Native Commissioner. Thescheme has been well received by the Press and the Natal Mercury welcomes it asthe boldest approach yet made to the problem of Native upiif tment.42. Mr. Lawrence, Minister of Social Welfare and Demobilisation, saidthat in connection with the State plans to re-adjust industry so as to absorb notonly the returned soldier but also the present workers, a survey was being under-taken to find out the number requiring technical training and also the number ofopenings in industry.43. As a result of the recommendation of the Trades and Labour CouncilAdvisory Committee that rationing of essential food by the Card System shouldbe introduced, the Food Controller has announced as an interim measure theestablishment of regional liaison committees to keep touch with local opinion and inform the Central Organisation of the supplies of main food-stuffs.44. Despite regulations and restrictions the transport position is deteriorat-ing, and the Minister of Transport, Mr. Sturrock, has issued a warning thatessential private cars will soon have to be requisitioned for essential services.Service A activities.45. After the fall of Rome the rapid retreat northwards of the german armies in Italy provided a chance for the further employment of our armouredand mobile formations. On the Eighth Army front the pursuit was immediatelytaken up by one United Kingdom armoured division and the South Africanarmoured division. The axis of march of the latter from their starting point inthe Valmontone area was north-westwards along Highway 6, thence, passingRome on the east side, on to Highway 3 northwards in the direction of Viterbo.The initial stages of the pursuit were rapid until a strong German rearguardposition was reached at Bagnoregio, a few miles east of Lake Bolsena. this position held up the South Africans for a while, but was finally broken throughon the 13th after heavy casualties had been inflicted and a number of german prisoners captured. This successful action opened the way to a further advance and by the 16th the South Africans were 15 miles north of Orvieto, where theybrushed aside German rear guards, destroying several anti-tank guns andcapturing more prisoners. From this point the further advance was slowed upmore by the difficult nature of the country than by German opposition until thesouthern approaches of Chiusi, which were reached on the 20th. At this pointGerman resistance stiffened considerably, especially in the area on each side of lake Trasimeno, and it was not until the 20th that Chiusi was finally cleared of enemy. On the last day of the month both the United Kingdom armoured troops on the east of the lake and the South African armoured division on the west sideagain managed to press on, in face of strong resistance, and registered a further advance of about five miles.EIRE.46. When the Dail assembled after the general election, the election of a newPrime Minister was the first business after the re-election of Mr. Fahy as Speaker.General Muloahy said he was fulfilling his obligations when he said that his party had no confidence in Mr. de Valera as Prime Minister. He said that the greatestresponsibility lay on the opposition parties in protecting the interests of thepeople against the system of government by one man. Mr. Donnellan (Farmers&apos;party) said that he believed the new Dail would have the opportunity of smashing
the Border and he hoped that when the opportunity came it would find&apos; themunited. Therefore, he would not oppose the nomination. Mr. Norton, Labour,said that in view of the record of ,Fianna Fail in office the nomination did not commend itself to him. Mr. Dillon, Independent, said that although he knew itwould be a disaster for the country if Mr. de Valera were re-elected, and thoughhis own instincts were against the motion and he was convinced thatMr. de Valera&apos;s election was a great dis-service to the nation, he would notchallenge the right of the people to make their choice, and therefore he wouldnot vote against him. When the motion was put, Mr. de Valera was re-elected by 81 votes to 37. Fine Gael, Labour, and some Independents voted against mr.. de Valera, but National Labour supported him; the Farmers&apos; party abstained from voting.47. The second reading of the Transport Bill which was the cause of the defeat of Mr. de Valera&apos;s Government in the previous Dail and so gave rise tothe recent general election, has now been carried in the Dail by 69 votes to 38.Mr. Lemass told the House that the Government was preparing to finance theTransport Scheme at a lower rate of interest than had been the case in any other public undertaking. Mr. Lemass said that the Bill was the same as the originalmeasure except that the dates were changed so as to provide that the Bill would come into operation next January instead of July of this year. The government thought it wiser to take legislative action now to establish the organisation thatwould be responsible for providing the public transport service. The best methodin their view was to establish a new organisation which would control all public transport services except those which operated across the Border. There werespecial considerations which affected these latter services, and if the presentsituation in respect of them should be altered fundamentally by legislationelsewhere then their decision not to interfere with the operation of these services which their jurisdiction would have to be reconsidered.48. .&apos;The Eire authorities have now decided that the issue of travel permitsto Great Britain for employment which were temporarily suspended in Marchmay now be resumed on a restricted scale. The following will not, however, be eligible for travel permits :-Persons who are in employment or for whom employment exists in Eire.Persons who refuse to take employment or who lose it through circum-stances within their control.People on the Special Register or agricultural and turf workers.Men living in rural areas and in towns of 5,000 population or less.People under 22 years of age except men discharged from the defence force on medical grounds; and persons whose services are regarded as essential in Ireland because ofspecial experience or qualifications.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.49. At the beginning of June the normal system of responsible government by ministries responsible to an elected Legislature was functioning in six of the eleven Provinces. By the end of this month it was still functioning in five, but with considerable discredit in one of them, while it had broken down in Orissa.50. In Bengal the Ministry, a coalition consisting mainly of Moslems whoare adherents of the Moslem League, has been losing a number of supportersamid a welter of intrigue in which bribery is reported to have been freely usedto increase the strength of the Opposition. The progress of the secondary education Bill, a measure partly designed to reduce the great preponderance of Hindu influence in the field of education in Bengal, provoked very heatedcommunal feelings in the Legislative Assembly, where the debates were markedby disgraceful scenes of disorder. The Assembly was prorogued by Mr. Caseyon the 23rd June. The Ministry, which earlier in June had survived,- though with a diminished majority, a vote of no confidence, has thus been given abreathing space to strengthen its position before it again meets the Assembly,
probably in August; but its tenure is insecure, and if it should be defeated theGovernor thinks that no alternative Ministry is possible and that he will haveto take over the administration under the breakdown provisions of Section 93 ofthe Government of India Act.51. In Orissa, which was administered by the Governor under Section 93for two years after the resignation of the Congress Ministry in November 1939,the Coalition Ministry, which has held office since November 1941, has resigned,and the Governor has been obliged again to take over the administration. the resignation was largely the result of personal differences between the PrimeMinister and his principal colleague; neither can form an alternative withoutthe other&apos;s support and, with the Congress party still refusing co-operation,there is no one else to undertake the task.52. Mr. Gandhi, after his wont, again attracted the limelight of politicalcomment. Partial disclosure by him of letters written from his place of detentionled the Government of India to publish the whole of the correspondence that had passed between him, the Viceroy and the Government of India. This included a lengthy letter in which, in his usual evasive manner, he sought to clear congress of any responsibility for the 1942 disturbances. During the month he wrote tothe Viceroy asking to be put in touch with the Congress leaders now in detentionand also suggesting that he should see Lord Wavell. The Viceroy refused, sayingthat, owing to their difference of views, there would be no practical value, but onlya source of subsequent disappointment, in his meeting Mr. Gandhi when he hadbut recently reaffirmed publicly his adherence to the Quit India Resolution ofAugust 1942.Foreign and Frontier Relations.53. Afghanistan. The Prime Minister recovered sufficiently from hisillness to resume full duty, but his nephew, the Deputy Prime Minister, issuffering from strain and has been ordered a month&apos;s rest.54. Mazarak. the tribal leader responsible for the recent trouble in theSouthern Province, took refuge in the hills in Maddakhel country on the Afghanside of the border and has not yet come to any settlement with the Afghan Govern-ment.  The general situation in the South has now, however, been stabilised.55. North-West Frontier. The Faqir of Ipi is still in Central Waziristanand his followers have inflicted some casualties on our forces, though they have obtained little support from the tribesmen. Punitive action with the aid of theair-arm and artillery was taken against them.Otherwise the situation on the Frontier remained quiet.56. Tibet. There was some further trouble over the size of the party whichthe Chinese Government wished to accompany their new Representative with theTibetan Government to Lhasa. The Chinese eventually demanded facilities fora total of 31 persons, including wives. The Tibetan Government agreed toallow 13 persons to accompany Mr. Shen, as visas had already been issued tothis number in Chungking, but informed the Chinese Government that theywere not prepared to admit more than this number. They informed our representative in Lhasa that they placed reliance on the support of the BritishGovernment in their refusal to admit a larger party. The Chinese continue topress in Chungking for the grant of visas for the remaining 17 persons.57. Persian Gulf. There is keen interest and general satisfaction at theprogress of the campaign in France.58. The Sultan of Muscat arrived back in his State on the 16th June fromhis visit to the Middle East.Economic.59. Transportation. Although it cannot be said that the question of meeting India&apos;s large additional requirements of broad-gauge locomotives andwagons has been resolved, some progress was made with this problem. At thebeginning of the month the India Supply Mission, who had been requested to explore the possibilities of obtaining production capacity in the United Statesand Canada, reported that Canada had offered to supply 100 locomotives and,000 wagons in 1945.   While this offer was under.consideration it was learned
that General Wheeler and General Covell (United States) had jointly supported the &quot;full demand for 206 locomotives and 14,000 wagons ; these figureshowever do not cover India&apos;s total needs from the United States and Canada, andaccordinelv the India Supply Mission have been briefed to^ubmit at a meetingof the Transportation Equipment Committee of the C.P.R-t5. at Washington onthe 30th June, a demand for a total of 318 locomotives and 24,000 wagons. this total is made up as follows : (i) 172 locomotives and 14,000 wagons required to maintain India&apos;s war potential at a level consistent with her use as a base and source^ ofsupply.   These figures are calculated on the assumption of fullrestoration of coastal traffic,(ii) 128 locomotives and 8,000 wagons to meet the anticipated deficiency inthe restoration of coastwise shipping,(iii) 18 locomotives and 2,000 wagons required to enable coal despatches tobe materially increased.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.Royal Indian Navy.60.   Nothing to report.Military.61. Italy. Indian troops forming part of the 8th Army were engagedthroughout the month, and at times encountered severe opposition from enemyrearguards.62. North-West Frontier-There was gang activity in Waziristan, but it received no organised tribal support. Some restiveness was apparent in Tirahamongst both Afridis and Orakzais owing to the effect of their supplies fromthe North-West Frontier Province being controlled.63. Burma. The main event was the reopening of the road Kohima-Imphal, which took place on the 22nd June, enabling convoys to get through.This relieved the supply situation at Imphal, and eased the burden borne bythe Air Forces in keeping the troops there supplied, which they had been doingin spite of very bad weather.64. The troops from Kohima put up a particularly fine performance, the speed of their advance overwhelming the Japanese, who abandoned muchequipment and stores.65. Fighting continued throughout the month in the vicinity of Bishenpurand Palel. The Japanese appeared to be concentrating their forces in these areas and near Ukhrul with a view to launching an attack on Imphal from theeast and south.   Patrols of our troops had entered Ukhrul.66. Kamaing was captured by General Stilwell&apos;s Chinese troops and onthe 21st June British and Chinese troops completed the occupation of theJapanese base of Mogaung on the railway to Myitkina. Fighting continued inthe vicinity of the latter place, American, British and Chinese troops beingengaged.   In the Arakan and Kaladan areas there was only patrol activity. *67. A ir -Monsoon conditions continued to make flying difficult. None theless, operations were maintained on a considerable scale. Over 8,000 offensive and defensive sorties were flown with negligible losses on our side. Manytransport sorties were flown in support of the troops. During two weeks forwhich figures are available 1,442 aircraft carried 3,250 tons of supplies and3,300 men to the battle areas, and evacuated 990 casualties and 10 P.W.68. A Sunderland Flying Boat operated from the Indawgyi Lakeevacuating casualties of the Long-Range Penetration Groups.69.   Sea mines were laid off Bangkok and Rangoon.General.70.   Pa^-Indian Troops.   The recent increases in pay and allowances to indian troops do not appear to have had such a good reception as was hoped forDisappointment was caused by delay in issuing details of the scheme   Also thegeneral consensus of opinion is that the increases have not succeeded in makingarmy pay comparable to that of civilians.
71. Bombay Docks. Progress of reconstruction work continued to be satisfactory.72. Morale. Morale of both British and Indian troops was raised by the news of Allied landings in France and there was also general confidence that operations on the Burma front were proceeding satisfactorily.73. Recruiting. The estimated intake for May 1944 is 35,000. This is4,500 more than the average for preceding months.74. Prisoners of War. 19,929 Prisoners of War have now been despatched to the United Kingdom.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.75. Occupied Burma. There is reason to believe that Ba Maw&apos;s single-party Government (a coalition of the three main political parties) is losing itsunity, to some extent owing to the manceuvrings of General Kawabe, the Japanesehead of affairs in Burma; and that Ba Maw&apos;s position has also been weakened byhis tactless and dictatorial behaviour. The Japanese are, however, committed tohim by the extent to which they have played him up in their Far Easternpropaganda.76. There is evidence of a considerable decline in the area under ricecultivation, which, together with transport difficulties, may lead to distress incertain areas of Burma. The acute shortage of clothing adds to public disillusion-ment, as it was confidently expected that cheap Japanese piece-goods would be oneof the rewards of the invasion.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &apos;&apos; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies to Ceylon.77. During the second half of 1944 Ceylon depend upon Brazil as the source of their supplies of imported rice. The Ministry of War Transport have agreedto the shipment of 42,000 tons of rice from Brazil during this period. these imports with stocks at the beginning of the period and rice already afloat willprovide Ceylon with their import requirements of 10,000 tons of rice monthly.The provision of shipping for Ceylon&apos;s requirements of 30,000 tons of flour and wheat monthly from Australia for the rest of 1944 is still the subject of consideration.Shipments from United Kingdom to Colonies.78. Colonial Governments have been informed that there were considerablyfewer outward loadings to Colonies from the United Kingdom with civilian cargo in June and that the reduction may continue for some months. arrangements have been made for the more urgent goods awaiting shipment to be picked out for loading in the reduced space available.West Indian Supply Officers&apos; Conference.79. A meeting took place in New York on the 20th June and succeeding days of the West Indian Supply Officers&apos; Conference to consider problems of supplies to British West Indian Colonies. A member of the Economic Division of theColonial Office (Mr. J. B. Williams) attended the conference.[27866] c
Defence.80. Two contingents of ground staff (tradesmen) for the Royal Air Force,each about 1,000 strong, have recently arrived in this country from the west indies. The men have proceeded to a training camp in Yorkshire. I amarranging to visit them in camp shortly.81. On the official celebration of The King&apos;s Birthday, the CaribbeanRegiment, which is proceeding to the Mediterranean theatre, held a ceremonialparade at their training camp in the United States. They were reviewed .byLieutenant-General F. N. Macready, head of the British Army Staff in washington, who addressed the Regiment and read messages to them from theSecretary of State for War and myself. The ceremony is of some historicalinterest as this is believed to be the first British Military Force which has trainedon United States soil since the American War of Independence.82. The rehabilitation of disabled African soldiers is being given close atten-tion by the Governments of East and West Africa. A rehabilitation centre, writhfacilities for the fitting and repair of artificial limbs, has been established atNairobi. Lord Swinton, Resident Minister of West Africa, visited this centre atthe end of May in connection with proposals to establish a similar centre at Accra,and possibly also Lagos.  He was accompanied by senior army and medical officers.83. A technical expert, Mr. J. Gough, branch manager of Messrs J. Hanger,Limited, is now in West Africa, where he will advise generally on the require-ments of the limb-fitting centre and in particular on the use of local timbers andother materials, and on the training of African staff.

Directives for the guidance of the authorities responsible for planning the administration of Civil Affairs in Malaya and the British territories inBorneo after their liberation have now been approved by the War Cabinet. Inaccordance with the War Cabinet decision the Rajah of Sarawak and the british north Borneo (Chartered) Company have been invited to open discussions regarding plans for the future government of their respective territories.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.86. The invasion of Europe was followed by the local population with interest, but the general tendency has been to regard it chiefly in terms of theultimate effect on their own self-interests and political ambitions.87. The Arab population has. been increasingly exercised by Zionistpropaganda abroad, particularly in America, and the Palestine Arab Party sent a telegram to President Roosevelt with a petition based on the Atlantic Charter.88. The activities of the Jewish Agency have been concentrated mainly uponJewish immigration. The Agency leaders are apparently determined to use upas quickly as possible all the remaining vacancies in the overriding maximum of 75,000 under the White Paper of 1939, in order to bring the immigrationissue to a crisis while the refugee problem is still acute in Europe and localindustry is still thriving.89. Terrorist organisations have confined their overt activities to thedistribution of pamphlets containing bitter attacks and threats against theGovernment and the Police. Underground activities of the Irgun Zvai Leumiand the Stern group continue, and there was an important seizure of explosivesand lethal instruments in Jerusalem on the 22nd June. Information regardingplans for further outrages on a large scale shows that vigilance against these bodies cannot be relaxed. In other respects, public security gives no immediatecause for concern.
90. , There has been considerable criticism of the high prices of raw materialsimported from abroad through the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation orother non-commercial channels.Trans Jordan.91. As a result of repeated representations made by the Government ofTransjordan regarding the future status of their country, the High Commissionerwas authorised on the 13th June to make the following statement to theTransjordan Government: &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have given earnest and sympathetic consideration to the Memorandum from the Council of Ministers of the4th November last on the future status of Transjordan. They are highlyappreciative of the unswerving friendship and support of the Governmentand people under the wise leadership of His Highness the Amir, and theygratefully recognise that in many critical periods of the last twenty years,and not the least during the darkest days of the present war, they have beenable unhesitatingly to rely on the willing and active co-operation of all sections of the community in Transjordan to the full extent of their powersand resources.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate that it is the desire of thepeople of Transjordan that they should take their place on an equal footing with the peoples of the neighbouring Arab countries, and to this end theywould welcome the conclusion of a Treaty with Transjordan which wouldconform more closely to the circumstances of the times than does the Agree-ment of 1928. For technical reasons the negotiation of such a Treaty must await the conclusion of the war. But, although meanwhile the formalrelations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government ofTransjordan must continue as at present, it will be the object of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to interpret them with due regard to this intention.&quot;92. The message appears to have been satisfactorily received. The HighCommissioner reported on the 21st June that the Transjordan Government had arranged for its publication locally in Transjordan and had sent it for publication in Palestine.Ceylon.93. Labour for Riibber Production. In view of the urgent need to increasesupplies of natural rubber, I have been considering with other ministers concerned what steps can be suggested for increasing the supply of estate labour in Ceylon. As a result telegrams are being sent to the Viceroy (for the G.O.C.,India) and to the Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia Area, suggesting the importation of further pioneer battalions from India to meet the require-ments of Service works in Ceylon so as to release local labour for rubberproduction.94.

The Commission of Enquiry appointed to enquire into the causes of theriots in 1943 has submitted its report, which will be published as soon as time has allowed for copies which arc now being printed in this country to be sent out to Mauritius.Gibraltar.97. The Report of a Committee set up by the late Governor to make recom-mendations for the improvement of education in Gibraltar has been presented.The   Committee   has   recommended   comprehensive   changes   in   the   whole
Educational system. Their proposal that a Director of Education should be immediately appointed has been accepted. The new Director is expected toTeavefor Gibraltar early in July.Cyprus.98. The Commission appointed by the Governor to report on questions ofwages and conditions of employment in relation to the cost of living haspresented its report. All its recommendations in respect of wages, allowances and gratuities have been accepted and put into effect. The changes provide for family allowances, for allowances for work in towns and for higher rates and increased benefits for regular workers. By making a distinction between thecasual and the regular worker particular improvement has been effected in theconditions of that section of the labourers who depend entirely on work inthe towns for their livelihood.Trinidad.99.   The Trinidad Franchise Committee have recommended (a) A substantial reduction in the qualifications for membership of theLegislative Council and eligibility of women for membership on thesame terms as men.(b) (By a majority), the immediate introduction of universal adult suffrage,but subject to a qualification that the English spoken language isunderstood.100. The Governor supports these recommendations, save in respect of the language qualification, which, he considers, should not be imposed, and I haveagreed with him on this.
