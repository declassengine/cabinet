(44) 412.26th July, 1944.WAR CABINET.LONG-RANGE ROCKET.Need for Re-examination of Government Plans.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.1. Nearly a year ago, and in an atmosphere of scepticism, the Cabinet-instructed that paper plans should be drawn up for dealing with attacks on london by long-range rockets of heavy explosive content. These plans were tobe such as could be implemented without materially entrenching upon the war effort. For the purpose of planning, a sustained attack was envisaged by10-ton missiles discharged at hourly intervals, half the missiles falling withina circle of 4 miles radius and the remainder within a circle of 16 miles radius.There was some disagreement amongst experts as to the casualties and damagelikely to result from an attack by a weapon whose characteristics were so largely a matter of speculation. It wTas assumed that blast would create the main problem and that there would be relative immunity from other serious enemy air attack. The plans were made within the framework of a &quot; stand firm &quot; policy,that is, the maintenance of the seat of Government in London and the continuanceof essential war production. Subject to this, facilities were to be provided forthe evacuation of the priority classes. Arrangements were also to be made bywhich, without any encouragement to evacuation, measures would be availablefor the transport and accommodation of those nervous elements of the populationwho sought refuge out of the capital.2. With the emergence of the flying bomb as the more probable secretweapon, the plans for dealing with the rocket were put on one side. Last week,however, we were advised by Intelligence that 1,000 rockets with a range ofpossibly 200* miles were believed to be in advanced state of preparation and thatthe warhead weighed probably 7 tons. The rate of fire is still a matter ofspeculation. The latest theory is that no elaborate launching sites are necessary and it is therefore reasonable to assume that the enemy will mount an attack ona fairly considerable scale, as he did in the case of flying bombs, even thoughthe frequency and density may be less.3. Flying Bomb Experience. For more than five weeks we have hadexperience of the flying bomb. Already this weapon has produced nearly 1,600incidents in London. That is to sa^, nearly 1,600 x 850 kilogrammes of high explosive have fallen on the Metropolis, mainly south of the river. The average number of fatal casualties in London has been 2-4 per bomb dropped in London,with about three times as many seriously injured and approximately the same number of slightly injured. About 15,500 houses have been totally destroyed or are beyond repair, and 691,000 houses have needed repairs.  (Some 502,000 houses* Although a range of 200 miles from the assumed launching points covers a number ofcities in the South of England the inaccuracy of the weapon is thought to be such that it would create single incidents only in the provincial cities and occasion no major problem of civil defence in those cities.[27888]b
have been repaired.) There is no evidence that supplies of the flying bomb areyet exhausted or that production has ceased.Resources already diverted to effects of flying bomb attacks.4. Already the flying bomb has made it necessary to embark upon theevacuation of priority classes. Unaccompanied schoolchildren, mothers with children under 5, expectant mothers and some old and infirm persons are nowbeing evacuated from London. Up to the 24th July 229,000 persons in all have left London in organised parties. A labour force of more than 50,000 men isnow employed on first-aid repairs to houses, and this will barely suffice to keepabreast of the task, assuming continuance of the flying bomb attacks on the present scale. Local authorities in the bombed areas are working at full pressure andhave had to be assisted in some cases by technicians from other districts. Arrange-ments made earlier in the year for reinforcing the Civil Defence Services properin case of rocket attack are able to cope with the relatively less intensive type ofincident produced by the flying bomb; indeed, so far there are substantialuntouched reserves of Civil Defence personnel outside the London area, andalthough soldiers of the Allied and His Majesty&apos;s Forces on the spot have renderedvaluable help, there has been no occasion to call for military assistance.The Future.5. What will be the position in the event of rocket attack on the scale now suggested, accompanied, as it seems likely to be, by continued attack by flying-bomb ?   Even piloted aircraft may be used to stage a maximum effort.6. It was clear from the outset of the original plans that if rocket attacksof the weight and on the scale originally assumed (see paragraph 1) evermaterialised, the Civil Defence resources mobilised to their full extent, wouldbe exhausted after three or four days of attack at hourly intervals by the largerweapon.-&apos; Ancillary services would also prove inadequate.Revised Scale of Rocket Attack.7. It is difficult to speak with any certainty as to the casualty and houserepairing problem that rocket bombardment would create. A new appreciationhas been prepared for the &quot; Crossbow &quot; Committee by the Research andExperiments Department of the Ministry of Home Security. It suggests various methods of calculation on different hypotheses. Using the experience to date with the flying bomb, it is estimated that a rocket with a 7-ton war-head,containing approximately 5^ tons of an aluminised filling, might produce in thebuilt-up areas of the Metropolis on an average fatal casualties amounting to no more than 20, with 60 seriously injured. If, however, we assume that the per-centage number of rockets which fall into Greater London is 60 per cent., as itis for the flying bombs which we fail to destroy (an assumption which is not strictly warranted) previous estimates agreed with the Paymaster-Generalindicate that about 30 people per projectile would be killed if 75 per cent, of thepopulation were in houses and 25 per cent, in the open. This should be amaximum under these conditions.The number of killed in London from the assumed stock of 1,000 rocketswould then be 600 x 30 = 18,000. It is a matter for speculation whether theseriously injured would be no more than, or even three times as many as, thekilled.There is corresponding uncertainty regarding the amount of material damage. All that can be said with any assurance is that each rocket with a 7-tonwar-head would be likely to produce A and1 B damage within a radius of 600 ft.,C damage 1,200 ft. and D damage 2,400 ft.* Beyond the D area, there will bea considerable amount of minor damage to roof coverings, odd windows, &amp;c.8. It may be taken as axiomatic that if all forms of attack (rocket and flying bombs and piloted aircraft) are delivered on any considerable scale, and ifthe casualty and damage are anything like the revised estimates, very substantialmilitary assistance will be needed, even if the rate of fire is less than was originally assumed.   In fact, the military assistance now available is less than* A damage - complete demolition; B damage = partial demolition houses notrepairable and needing to be demolished; C damage - houses so badly damaged as to beuninhabitable, but repairable; D damage = houses not so badly damaged as to bo uninhabitable,but sufficiently so as to cause appreciable discomfort or inconvenience.
half of what was to be provided, under the original.plans, and stands at present at 8,000 men. The labour force of 50,000 would have to be supplemented to dealwith debris and clearance, as well as with first aid repairs, by thousands of mendrafted into London, with all the attendant problems of accommodation and feeding.&apos;&apos; It is unlikely that sufficient labour and. materials could be madeavailable to keep pace with the rate of damage now envisaged, and even if thehead of labour were considerably increased it would probably be necessary to restrict repairs in the first place to houses which are occupied. The number ofthese would depend on the extent to which London is evacuated. Delay inrepairing unoccupied houses would, of course, lead to their deterioration and to heavy loss of furniture, particularly if the weather should be wet.Probable Exodus of Population.9. The situation in regard to the exodus of population from London may also be extremely difficult in the event of attack on the scale now suggested aspossible. The plans which have been made under this head have recently been reviewed by an Inter-Departmental Conference. On the assumption of a &quot; stand firm &quot; policy (apart from the organised evacuation of priority classes), enjoinedupon the population with all the emphasis at the command of the Government,it was estimated that the number of people still seeking to leave London mightbe of the order of half a million. It was assumed that, while nothing should bedone to encourage people to leave, it would be necessary to provide rail facilities to clear the stations of those seeking to leave; and this number could be removed by the railways, at the rate of 80,000 a day, in about a week. This figure would include any organised evacuation of priority classes under the government scheme. Even on this estimate there would undoubtedly be serious congestionat the railway stations, and it would be a difficult problem for the police tocontrol the exodus in an orderly manner. People might also seek to travel shortdistances out of London by bus, tube or on foot, and this traffic would tend to bedirected to the North and West of London. Provision has already been made which would allow of about 1,000,000 people being fed and accommodated inrest centres and reception centres outside the central areas of London but withina 40-mile radius. The centres provided include a large amount of rough and ready accommodation in churches, schools, halls, &amp;c, and could not be muchextended since all suitable accommodation has already been earmarked.Although this accommodation is on a very considerable scale, only a part of itlies to the North and West, and there might be a heavy strain upon it in theevent of a large-scale refugee movement to this area. It should, however, bepossible to . clear the rest centres when they become full by billeting and byevacuation by road and rail transport to the North of England. But it is certainthat the arrangements cannot work efficiently unless the large number of peopleresponsible for operating them, including those whose duty it would be to open and make ready emergency rest centres, are warned to bring their preparations to a state of readiness. In view of the possible imminence of rocket attacks,the Minister of Health has requested the Regional Commissioners concerned toensure that the arrangements made twelve months ago are overhauled at once but without undue publicity. -In order to reduce the dimensions of the possible exodus if the rocket arrivesand to prevent conditions arising which would seriously impair the effectiveness of the injunction to &quot; stand firm,&quot; the Civil Defence Committee has authorised the Minister of Health to take steps by poster publicity in the evacuable area ofLondon, urging the members of the priority classes to take advantage now of thefacilities available for their evacuation.It would be possible to extend the evacuable classes by including mothers with children of school age. But neither this extension nor increased publicity arelikely to have much effect at present unless the true reason for seeking to stimulateevacuation can be frankly disclosed to the public.10. The new appreciation of the scale upon v/hich it is possible that rocketattack may be delivered obviously involves reconsideration of some of the assump-tions upon which the plans so far made have been based. According to figuressupplied by the Ministry of Food, it appears that over half a million people&quot;havealready left London under their own arrangements (in addition to the 229,000official evacuees) since flying-bomb attacks started, and the figure of half a millionassumed as the maximum who would leave on rocket attack seems likely, therefore,[27888] r     b 2
to be an under-estimate. If attack were to develop on the scale with which we arenow threatened, the exodus might reach such proportions as to present a completely unmanageable problem both for the police and for the railways, andthe pressure of evacuees by bus, tube or on foot on the North and West perimeterof London might result in the complete breakdown of the emergency accommoda-tion and feeding arrangements. Moreover, it was recognised by the Inter-Departmental Conference that we must face the fact that many workers would leave London with their families in order to make sure that their families were settled in a place of safety. The only method of mitigating a serious loss ofproduction by this cause would be to give an assurance to all workers in london that facilities would be given for their wives and children to be taken out to saferareas under organised arrangements made by the Government. If such facilities could be provided and advantage was taken of them on any extensive scale, it would, of course, create a special problem of feeding arrangements for the male workers whose wives left London and would have important consequentialeffects in the decline of trade, the closing of small shops, &amp;c, which would nodoubt lead to an increase in the numbers of people seeking to leave the capital.The whole question of the steps to be taken to secure that the mass of the essentialworkers remain at their work in London, while at the same time providingfacilities for the exit of women and children and non-essential workers, is one ofthe greatest difficulties which will have to be examined entirely afresh in thelight of what we have now been told as to the possible scale of attack. It is quite impracticable to devise any system of control which would effectively secure thatthe people who ought to stay, stay, and the people who ought to go, go; on theother hand,&apos;we cannot blind ourselves to the possibility that a mere injunction to&quot;stand firm,&quot; coupled with the provision of such facilities as can be made avail-able for those who, for good or bad reasons, wish to leave, may not provide any solution of the problem and may indeed assist in creating the very disorgatiisa-tion of the life of the capital which it is our aim to avoid.Hospitals.11.   The hospital problem is twofold (a) Clearance of hospitals in the target area, partly to save the lives of patients already there and partly to provide for the initial treatmentof casualties occurring subsequently;(b) Provision of accommodation for treatment of casualties.(a) Clearance of Hospitals.It is thought that clearance should be limited to the area of London Region.This would mean the evacuation of 28,000 patients, together with 8,000 chronicsick, or, say, 36,000 cases in all. If all these cases were removed to areas in theNorth of England and to Scotland, more than 100 ambulance trains would berequired and evacuation would take several weeks. It would, therefore, be better to remove some of the patients by road to areas nearer at hand and the remainderto the North and West. Even then there would be a heavy strain on road and rail transport and the operation would take two or three weeks.By careful selection of the hospitals to which&quot; the patients were sent it would still be possible to receive battle casualties from Normandy at the present rate oftheir arrival in this country. But it might become necessary to balance thenumbers brought back to England with those held in Normandy.It is for consideration whether the London hospitals should be cleared now in preparation for the possibility of rocket attacks.(b) Reception of Casualties.Hospitals in inner London would be used as casualty reception units and the patients evacuated by road after initial treatment to the outer areas of Londonand perhaps still further afield. In this way about 4,000 cases could be handledper day, a figure just double the worst day in the 1940/41 blitz.Thus 30,000 hospital casualties a week would be as many as the hospitalscould handle. The strain on staff would, of course, increase with each successiveweek. The task could only be accomplished by medical and nursing staff working to the limit of their endurance and by the rapid evacuation (and perhaps pre-mature discharge) of patients. After the first two or three weeks the standardof attention would have deteriorated badly and the provision would amount tolittle more than shelter accommodation with the minimum of necessary treatment.
If the figures given in paragraph 7 are accepted, the number of casualtiesrequiring hospital treatment produced by 1,000 rockets might exceed, and perhapsgreatly exceed, 30,000. In addition, there would be some flying-bomb casualties.It is thus possible that the hospital service would be swamped, though much would depend on the rate of fire of rockets.Public Morale and Expectations.12. A prolonged attack by both weapons, producing such consequences as are described above, will inevitably put the severest strain upon public morale.Comparisons of the weight of bombs dropped on Berlin and London respectivelyare misleading. It is probable that evacuation of Berlin on a very large scaletook place long ago and that alternative or duplicate provision has been made formany of the vital war industries once carried on in the German capital. the citizens of Berlin have longer notice of ai r attacks : these attacks are concentratedand. of short duration : there are drastic rules for taking shelter during raids,and it is possible that deep shelter exists to a greater extent than in London. TheBritish public will accept hardship, suffering and casualties that are clearly dueto unpreventible enemy action. They will be less ready to submit even toinconveniences which they judge to be due to Government inactivity or lack of preparations. It is wrong to expect of civilians who have endured more than fouryears of warfare, with all the attendant industrial fatigue and disorganisation of normal life, the same high standard of morale as the Army. Over the sameperiod the Army has been fed, and trained to endure severe trials and the hardshipof battle : the public has just carried on.13. As the areas of sheer devastation grow under continuous bombardment,I fear that the public will become angry, though whether the anger will be directedsolely against the enemy may be doubted. We have boasted rightly of our air superiority and military strength. We shall be expected to use our resources to eliminate attacks on the Metropolis by the new weapons as wre have virtuallyeliminated raids by ordinary aircraft. It wall be difficult to give convincing-reasons why this cannot be done. In my view, the rocket attack must from now onwards be regarded as a major effort by the Germans to avoid sheer defeat. Itmust be met by us by a corresponding effort both in active attack and passivedefence, and not regarded as fatalistically inevitable or even as a by-product of enemy activity to be dealt with by the resources of the Fighting Forces which arenot otherwise required to prosecute the war.Nexv Plans.14. This is not an appropriate paper in which to pursue questions of the offensive measures to be adopted. As to defensive preparations, they must nowbe reviewed by all Departments concerned, in the light of the current appreciation of the probabilities and effects of rocket attacks. That review will have to coversuch questions as evacuation, the treatment of casualties, increased military reinforcements and all the problems connected with the bringing of a furtherlabour force into London. The background against which the other problems are dealt with will be greatly affected by the decision on the policy of evacuation. Onthe analysis of the situation made in this paper, it seems to me that there is thefollowing choice of policies :  (i) To assume that the &quot; stand firm &quot; policy can be carried out as originallyenvisaged, and that the plans already made will suffice. I wish that i could make this assumption with conviction,(ii) To assume that there will be a more sustained attack than we at firstcontemplated and that accordingly a greater exodus of the populationthan was originally planned, will take place, but that the numberswill be no larger than can be dealt with by improvisation once the attack begins.(iii) To assume that very considerable numbers of the population will not beable to stand the strain, and therefore at once to bring to a state of readiness and, if possible extend, the arrangements already made forthe possibility of a considerable exodus and the provision of accom-modation outside the target a.reas for large numbers of refugees. Thispolicy is the one which the Minister of Health (whom I have consultedr
Gon the several matters affecting his Department) and I are disposed tofollow. If this policy is agreed, it would be advisable to get as many as possible of the priority classes moved now. Some steps have alreadybeen taken to stimulate this movement but if it is to be fully successfula public announcement about the rocket would, in my view and thatof the Minister of Health, be essential.I suggest that the Cabinet should make up its mind -which of these policies to adopt. In the event of the third being chosen, it would seem desirable that instructions should be given to the Departments concerned to work out thenecessary plans urgently.Home Office and Ministry of Home Security,Whitehall, S.W. 1,2Qth July, 1944.
