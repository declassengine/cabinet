E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1, *2nd August, 1944.[J.I.C. (44) 336 (O).   Final.]31st July, 1944.WAR CABINET.Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.IMMINENCE OF ATTACK BY &quot; big ben.&quot;Report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.WE have been asked to assess the degree of imminence of attack by &quot; big ben,&quot;and in this paper we do so within the limitations of the evidence available, whichis fragmentary and inconclusive.2. We have no evidence of any physical reason preventing the launching of &quot; big ben &quot; in the immediate future. It may well be that about a thousandof these rockets exist. If so, inadequacy of stocks should not deter the germans from launching &quot; big ben &quot; now. Launching sites exist, are of simple design andeasy to construct. Plants for producing liquid oxygen in France and Belgium(though of relatively small scale) are known to have been constructed. Othersuch plants may have been constructed and the resources for producing oxygenfor commercial purposes might be and may have been converted, at the costof other uses, for producing liquid oxygen for &quot; big ben.&quot; Personnel have been trained in handling these weapons, and at least a skeleton organisation exists in the West. The fact that trials and experimental work are still being carried[27942]
out does not in itself indicate that the weapon could not be launched now. Trialsare, for that matter, still being carried out with the flying bomb. Moreover,the Germans planned, at least in one area, to complete the launching sites by july, and in mid-June flak units, probably earmarked for the &quot; big ben&quot;organisation, were to be made available by the end of July.3. On the other hand, there is a lack of evidence such as we should expectif the enemy were now in a position to launch an attack on any considerable scale.The known preparations for producing and storing liquid oxygen would suffice to maintain only a very small scale of effort if the capacity of the projectile isas estimated. There have been no reports of the movement of tank waggons inthe area although such waggons, as observed elsewhere, are very characteristic.4. In mid-July a well-informed high ranking officer told a usually reliable source that &quot; big ben &quot; would probably be used within two or three months&apos; time.It might be argued that, in view of the very high degree of security which theGermans have applied to &quot; big ben,&quot; they may for once have deliberatelymisinformed this reliable source by post-dating D Day. In the circumstancesof this conversation, however, we should normally expect the German statement to have erred on the side of optimism.5. The Germans may&apos; have one of two reasons for postponing the launching of &quot; big ben.&quot;   They may either : (a) Be faced with a physical limitation of which we have no knowledge andthus be unable to use the weapon effectively or with safety.  Our know-ledge of the projectile and all the processes involved in production and&apos; operation is still so incomplete that such limitations would be likelyto be unknown to us; or ^(b) While able in fact to launch &quot; big ben &quot; now. they may have decided onlyto launch the operation at greater intensity.   Nevertheless Hitler may. be impelled by military disasters to launch this weapon before he is fully ready.6. We regard the conversation referred to in paragraph 4 above as mor significant when taken in conjunction with a report from a usually reliable sourceto the effect that &quot; big ben &quot; would be launched by the beginning of September.This is strengthened by the negative evidence given in paragraph 3 above and bythe statement in Goebbel&apos;s speech of the 26th July, in that this weapon &quot;haspartly entered upon the process of manufacture.&quot; We, therefore, feel that a heavy and sustained scale of launchings against this country is unlikely to developduring August. Continued military disasters may, however, compel the earlieror even immediate employment of this weapon, when the scale of effort would be small.(Signed) V.   CAVENDISH-BENTINCK.E. G. N.
