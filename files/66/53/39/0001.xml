THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET.Copy -No.  3 6W.P. (44) 439.11th A it gust, 1944./YjTAR CABINET.CONVERSATIONS WITH M.  MASSIGLI.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE agenda for these conversations, upon which I agreed with M. Massigliwhen he was recently in London, includes the following item : &quot;France and the work of the European Advisory Commission.Questions concerning the Armistice, the Rhineland and the occupation ofGermany.&quot;2. The French will attach all the more importance to these subjects sincethe Prime Ministers recent speech in the House of Commons. I think it appro-priate to circulate, for the consideration of my colleagues, a statement of policy on which I would propose to base myself in speaking to M. Massigli.I. French Membership of the European Advisory Commission.3. The case for French membership rests on France&apos;s status as a great power without whose co-operation no satisfactory solution of the german problem can be reached. A French member would contribute to the proceedings and would probably help his British colleague.4. It is open to His Majesty&apos;s Government to propose French membershipto the United States and Soviet Governments. The latter are unlikely to welcome the proposal because they adhere strictly to the Three-Power principle in all german plans. The United States Government are also likely7 to be opposedat this stage because of their scruples about recognition of the French Committeeof National Liberation; but they have recently taken a significant step forward by proposing that France should be admitted as a Great Power to the futureWorld Organisation as soon as she has a fully recognised government.5. However remote the chances of acceptance, the proposal still seemsworth making for the sake of Anglo-French relations. I would not, however,propose to go so far with M. Massigli at this stage. I would only7 say that wewould examine the question afresh and sympathetically, and consult the UnitedStates and Soviet Governments.II. Consultation  between the European Advisory  Corn-mission and  theFrench Committee of National Liberation about Germany.6. The French Committee of National Liberation, like other AlliedGovernments, have received from the European Advisory Commission a formalinvitation to express their views on surrender terms for Germany. I have encouraged the French to respond to this invitation. M. Massigli, however, hasalready asked me whether the French Committee and the other Allies, once theyhad communicated their views, would be invited, if they so desired, to discuss them with the European Advisory Commission. Such a procedure, which wouldbe in accordance with the Commissions terms of reference, seems very desirable,and I propose to instruct Sir W. Strang to approach his colleagues, and to expressour desire that it should be done. We must assume that the Soviet representativewill oppose this procedure. I would propose only to tell M. Massigli that weare in consultation on this matter with the United States and Soviet Governments.12466   [27984]
III. Intimate Franco-British Talks outside the Eiiropean Advisory Commission.7. The French will not be satisfied merely with discussing their ownsuggestions with the European Advisory Commission. They are anxious to pursue with us the intimate and secret conversations initiated between sir W. Strang and the late M. Vienot and they will want to inspect the actualdraft terms which we intend to impose on Germany. I propose to speak quitefrankly to M. Massigli about our plans for Germany on the understanding thatour talks are most confidential. These intimate talks will cover the followingground : &apos;8. (a) Surrender Terms for Germany. I propose to tell M. Massigli orallythe contents of the European Advisory Commission^ Surrender Instrument. would explain that I could not show this document to him, but that I would consider whether we could get the approval of the United States and soviet governments to letting him see a cop3r. I would then propose to approach both these Governments and suggest that the time had come to show the Instrumentto some of our Allies, especially the French, and urge them to agree to this being done.9. (b) French Participation in the Occupation of Germany. M. Vienot, in conversation with Sir W. Strang, said that the French would like a small separatezone of occupation along the Franco-German frontier between Luxemburg andthe Rhine. General de Gaulle spoke in Washington of French occupation ofthe Rhineland, though he may have meant French participation rather than an exclusive French occupation.10. The Chiefs of Staff consider that a separate French zone in the early stages of occupation is unacceptable. We would, however, like to include Frenchcontingents in the British zone and the draft occupation Protocol at present under discussion by the European Advisory Commission will enable us formally to invite French participation as soon as the Protocol has been received and approved by the three Governments. I propose to inform M. Massigli accordingly.If he presses for a separate French zone I shall point out the practical objectionsand ask him to be content-with French participation at the start; but I will add that we do not exclude the creation of a separate French zone at a later stage.11. (c) French Participation in the Control of Germany. So long as supreme authority in Germany is exercised by the British, United States and soviet Commanders-in-Chief, the French cannot participate on an equal footing.But once military is replaced by civilian control it seems very desirable that fullFrench membership should be arranged as early as possible.12. I propose that we should make this our objective in the forthcoming discussions in the European Advisory Commission about machinery for controlling-Germany. Both the United States and Soviet Governments may well make difficulties about going as far we would wish in associating other AlliedGovernments in the control of Germany. It would accordingly be unwise inadvance of the European Advisory Commission^ discussions to make any firmpromises to M. Massigli, but I shall inform him that we are in sympatheticagreement with French desires under this head.13.-(d) The Rhineland. Apart from the occupation of the Rhineland,M. Massigli may wish to discuss its future. Many schemes have been put forward on this subject; some approaching it from an economic standpoint, others fromthe political and strategic. The subject is inevitably linked with wider issues;particularly dismemberment and the economic future of Germany. Until policy decisions have been reached on these, I shall be careful not to commit myself toM. Massigli.A. E.Foreign Office, 11th August, 1944.
