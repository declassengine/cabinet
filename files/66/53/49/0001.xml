(44) 449.17th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE MILITARY OCCUPATION OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIESAFTER DEFEAT.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff.IN our memorandum on &apos;&apos; Man-power One Year after the Defeat ofGermany,&quot;* in which we request certain decisions from His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, we stated that we were examining the problem of the maximum use ofair power in the occupation of Germany as a means of enforcing our control.2. We attach at Annex a paper setting out our views on this subject andwe now request the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the application inGermany of the general policy outlined in this paper.3. Up to the present, no examination of the effect, of our proposals on the size of the occupational forces required for Germany has yet been made; butthis is now in hand.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.C. PORTAL.ANDREW CUNNINGHAM.Offices of the War Cabinet,17th August, 1944.ANNEX.The Military Occupation of Developed Countries After Defeat.The purpose of this paper is to discuss the military occupation and controlof a defeated enemy country, with particular reference to the respective contri-butions to be made by land and air forces.Fulfilment of Peace Terms.2. It is assumed that after the enemy country has acknowledged defeat,the victorious forces will impose armistice terms and proceed to occupy thecountry until satisfied that the short-term peace conditions have been fulfilledand that a responsible ex-enemy Government can and will observe the long-termconditions. The short-term conditions of peace will usually include there patriation of prisoners of war, demobilisation of enemy forces, dismantlingof military works, conversion or closing of war factories, and the disposal of warmaterial.3. The execution of these terms will require supervision by military and/or civil commissions of control who may have to work in small parties throughoutthe defeated country.* C.O.S.

Post-war conditions in the defeated country.4. Defeat is likely to have a disruptive influence on the life of the defeatedcountry. Demobilised forces, refugees from war areas, and people thrown outof war employment will form a disturbing political element, and a stableGovernment acceptable to the Allies is not likely to emerge immediately. Theattitude of the people to the Allies and to the formation of a Governmentsupported by the Allies is likely, at first, to be one of relief at the arrival ofstabilising influences; but relief may change to apathy, and apathy to discontentif it appears that the Allies and/or the Government are unable or unwilling to maintain law and order.5. Furthermore, in countries where the will to resist has survived the collapse of the armed forces, an organised resistance movement is to be expected,whose object will be to encourage the people to continue at least passive resistance, to harass the occupying civil and military forces, and to liquidatepolitical opponents and those elements of the native population who show aninclination to collaborate with the Allies. Such a resistance movement,particularly if planned before the war ends, is likely to be well armed, welltrained, and well organised and well led.Need for Forces of Occupation.6. The civil and military commissions set up to supervise the fulfilment of peace terms may therefore expect to meet with difficulties varying in degreefrom administrative breakdowns, due merely to political and economic dislocation-tion, to passive resistance and sabotage, and, in the worst case, to actively hostileinterference from armed and organised forces of resistance. If the commissionsare to do their work efficiently, they must be backed by armed force.Role of the Forces in Occupation.7. The role of the Forces of Occupation will be to restore and/or maintaincivil order to enable the Control Commission to administer the peace terms. Thetask will depend on the progress of events within the occupied country. In thebest case, the defeated people may be anxious to collaborate with their new government and our forces of occupation, and the problem will then be one ofmaintaining civil administration in a state in which the Control Commission canwork without difficulty. A more difficult problem will arise if passive resistanceand localised antagonism to the new Government and/or the occupying forces should develop; such a situation may require military intervention. The worstcase will arise if an organised resistance movement emerges and begins to spread;this will require immediate and drastic military action if resistance is to be prevented from gaining momentum.General Collaboration with Forces of Occupation.8. To complete their work the Control Commission will require themaintenance of efficient systems of transportation, police and labour control.If an authoritative Government, acceptable to us, was supported by the people and prepared to collaborate with the Control Commissions, forces of occupationwould hardly be required. This state of affairs is not very probable; but it isquite possible that the population would be disorganised, yet submissive to political and military direction by the Allies; occupying forces could play a usefulbut limited part in such a situation, which calls for the presence of land forces as a stabilising influence while a new Government emerges and takes control..The Emergence of Resistance.9. Although the defeated population may be so war-weary as to acceptsubmissively the Control Commissions and/or the administration of the new government, it is possible that apathy will eventually change to feelings of shameand frustration as chaos subsides and more settled conditions obtain. At thisstage propaganda against the Government is more likely to command a hearingand the organised resistance movement earlier discussed wHl not be slow to makethe most of general disaffection.10. Early symptoms of disaffection will be demonstrations of hostility tothe Control Commissions and/or the Government, strikes, sabotage and outbreaks of political terrorism. The situation will go from bad to worse unless action istaken immediately against the first outbreaks of unrest.
11. The Government authorities responsible for maintaining order will wishto protect the unarmed population against the forces of resistance, and will belikely to plead, with some show of justification, to be allowed to form their ownsubstantial armed and mobile police forces on para-military lines. Such a concession was made to Germany after the last Avar, and resulted in there constitution of the enemy Army. This solution is, therefore, quite unacceptable,and the onus of quelling unrest must be accepted as a commitment for our own forces of occupation.The Use of Land Forces.12. The ideal answer to the problem would be for us to maintain substantialgarrisons throughout the country, but this would be too extravagant in man-power. The alternative is to establish strategic reserves in centres whence theforces required can be deployed at very short notice to the disaffected areas. the arrival of troops, and especially of armour, is likely to restore order and their presence will encourage the more responsible elements of the population to regaincontrol. If the mere presence of troops does not restore order, the imposition ofcurfew and movement restrictions, coupled with active measures against openresistance, will eventually be effective.13. Some special arrangements may have to be made to deal with the hardcore of resistance. Determined gangs, well armed and well trained in guerrillatactics, will present a difficult problem, and it will be necessary to form a highlymobile and specially trained force to hunt them down and exterminate them.The success of a resistance movement must depend on the extent to which it canwin popular sympathy and support, since without this it is not likely to survivefor long. Hence speed and firmness of action in dealing with the first symptomsof resistance are particularly necessary, otherwise the movement will gain ground in popular estimation.14. The central reserve system as outlined above, coupled with the specialforce of resistance-hunters, is the most economical answer to the problem facing aland force, but it must be remembered that these reserves must be substantial.Unrest, particularly if organised from behind the scenes, is likely to appearsimultaneously at widely separated places, and the forces sent to deal with it mustbe equal to their task. The failure of a force to deal quickly and effectively withunrest would be the signal for a spreading and intensifying of resistance thatwould call for the deployment of very much larger forces. The possibility of effecting economy in land forces by the use of air power is discussed below.The Air Contribution.15. Air transport can contribute to the speed of deployment of land forces,and to a certain extent this enhanced degree of mobility will also effect economy of land forces; transport aircraft, however, require a fairly large maintenance and administrative organisation, and the economy in land forces must be balancedagainst an increase in the air transport commitment.1.6. In the tactical role the tasks set are such that the air cannot make avery substantial contribution to land operations. Tactical support for the resistance-hunters would be of considerable value when they are working in open country, but it cannot be of very great assistance to troops endeavouring to restoreorder and take control in built-up areas.17. The most promising task for air forces is that of bringing pressure tobear upon a recalcitrant area before the arrival of the troops. Troops airlandedin a rebellious area are likely to meet with extremely stiff opposition, and theywill be fighting on more or less equal terms with the resisters, unless they arrive in overwhelming force. If air forces can be used to bring the population to aframe of mind where they will welcome the arrival of troops as a means ofprotection against the resisters and as a sign that air pressure has been relaxed,the Army task will be much simplified and correspondingly small land forces willbe needed.18. The population of a country that has suffered heavy air bombardmentin war may be expected to have a deep respect for the bomber-especially whenthey know they are without the protection of A.A. weapons and fighters. the speedy arrival of forces of bombers over a recalcitrant area will remind thepopulation of their helplessness, and if at the same time warnings are dropped
or broadcast, specifying their offence, telling them in simple terms what we wantthem to do, and what will happen to them if they refuse to obey, it is probablethat in many cases no further action will be needed.19. If the warning expires and the desired effect has not been achieved,pressure from the air can be applied immediately. A modern community is extremely sensitive to such interference with its way of life as the disruption ofutility services, and to the removal of its means of livelihood, such as factories anddocks. Swift and accurate attack by comparatively small bomber forces against such targets will eventually make life unbearable, and the general public, havinglearned a lesson in collective responsibility, will turn against the influences thatare bringing ruin on the area. In extremely stubborn cases built-up areas mayhave to be demolished, but sooner or later suiTender will be forthcoming.20. When the surrender stage is reached, land forces can enter and take overcontrol, together with the specialised force to deal with any remaining resistancegangs. The Army commitment in such circumstances will be obviously very much smaller than that required to deal with an area unsubdued by air action, and it isconsidered that, if employed as suggested, air forces can play a useful part with land forces in applying efficient and economical control.Political Factors.21. The foregoing argument is based on questions of military efficiencyonly, and has not taken into account the political factors that may arise if airforces are used as suggested. Familiar charges against bombing are those ofinhumanity and inaccuracy. The question of inhumanity is purely sentimental.If ample&apos; warning is given the population will have time to evacuate the threatened area and be safe from danger; the remedy is in their own hands. Thecharge of inaccuracy may have been true when aircraft and bombing equipmentwere more primitive, but the degree of accuracy that can be attained by a modernbomber force operating without opposition, particularly in daylight, is very highindeed.22. Such charges, therefore, are groundless, but may appeal to sentimentalpeople in this country who will no doubt be encouraged by enemy post-war propa-ganda to make public protests. It will be the responsibility of the Governmentof the day to ensure that the facts are put before the public in this country andabroad, in order that the economies in men and money resulting from this use ofair forces may be realised.Conclusions.23. In the early stages of occupation, land forces will be required to main-tain order until a Government acceptable to us can take over the administration ofthe country. Thereafter, land forces will be required to take action against out-breaks of unrest; action must be prompt and effective if the spread of unrest is tobe checked. Special forces will be required to hunt down and exterminate anyorganised resistance movement.24. Air transport can confer mobility on the land forces, but any resultanteconomy in troops must be balanced against the extra air force commitment.Tactical air forces may be of value in co-operation with the resistance-hunterswhen working in open country, but are of little value to troops engaged in built-built-up areas.25. Bomber forces can be used to bring rebellious areas to surrender beforeland forces move in. The land task will therefore be simpler and smaller land forces will be needed.26. If political objections to bombing are raised, it will be for the Govern-ment of the day to point out to the public that bombing is a humane and economicalmethod of control.
