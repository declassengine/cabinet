SPECIAL MEASURES FOR &quot; big ben.&apos;&apos;&apos;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs.AT the War Cabinet meeting on the 28th July a decisi6n was taken to acceptthe more drastic of the two security schemes to be put into effect in the eventof rocket attack. I am not sure whether my colleagues fully understand the effectthat this would have on the communications of our Allies. Under the interpre-tation put on this scheme all foreign governmental organisations in this country,including the Allied Governments resident here and the United States and SovietAmbassadors, will be absolutely prevented from communicating with their governments or officials outside this country for a period of at least 48 hours.2. When the matter was previously considered by the Home defence executive I expressed the view that all diplomatic mail and telegrams of theUnited States and Soviet Ambassadors and of the Allied Governments resident in this country ought to be passed without delay under whichever of the alterna-tive procedures were adopted. I still adhere to this view. I am certain that wecan rely on the discretion of the United States and Soviet Governments, and theAllied Governments resident here have no reason to send out of this countryany information about &quot; big ben &quot; attack. I am, however, prepared to ask theForeign Ministers of these Governments and the United States and SovietAmbassadors to make themselves personally responsible for ensuring that nosuch information is sent.3. Quite apart from the political objections to any attempt to hold up these telegrams, any action taken in the case of the United States and Soviet Embassieswould probably be quite ineffective, since the United States Embassy possessesdirect lines not under our control and the Soviet Embassy has a private wirelesstransmitter. I have been asked by the Home Defence Executive to request thetwo Ambassadors not to send any information about rocket attack by this means.While I am prepared to do this I feel certain that such a request would be far more likely to be favourably received if we have not interfered with the despatchof their ordinary cypher telegrams and couriers.A.
