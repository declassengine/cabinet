(44) 409.25th July 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY IN WESTERN EUROPE.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of a despatch from Mr. Duff Cooper regarding our policy in Western Europe,together with a copy of my reply.A. E.Foreign Office, 2bth July, 1944.Mr. Duff Cooper to Mr. Eden. [Received 13th June.)The Office of theBritish Representative with the(No. 295.  Secret.) French Committee of National Liberation,Sir,, Algiers, 30th May, 1944.&apos; I have the&apos; honour to report that, as stated m my telegram No. 359 of the20th March and in my despatch No. 217 of the 24th April, I have recently beenasked, both by the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and by my Belgian colleague,whether I could give them any indication of the trend of British post-war foreignpolicy. As this matter is doubtless occupying your close attention I venture to lay before you certain reflections which you may be willing to take intoconsideration.2. There will probably appear after the war a widespread demand for someall-embracing international organisation which would have the merits withoutthe defects of the League of Nations, and would be designed to prevent therecurrence of war. Whatever form such an organisation may take, and whateversanctions it may exercise, it is difficult to see how it can escape the fundamentalweakness which proved fatal to the League, and which is rooted in the reluctance of all nations to resort to methods of force, entailing the sacrifice of human life,unless their own immediate and vital interests are demonstrably in danger. Itis this very natural reluctance which deprives international law of the powerof sanction essential to the nature of law itself. Although then it will doubtless be both necessary and desirable to set up some system of this sort and to render it as powerful and efficient as possible, it would be imprudent to stake the wholefuture of mankind on its success and to make no provision for its failure.3. To do so would be to repeat the error of British policy during the twodecades that divide the world wars. It may not have been wrong to base foreignpolicy on the efficacy of the League of Nations and the principle of collective security, but it certainly was wrong to have no alternative policy to fall back onin the event of the League proving a failure, and it was still more wrong not tohave adopted an alternative after that failure had already become apparent. in what follows, therefore, it will be assumed that some world-wide organisation will exist of which the British Commonwealth will form a part, but which willnot prevent Great Britain and the Dominions from making separate alliances,any more than they were prevented from doing so by the covenant of the Leagueof Nations.12442   [27883
24. It should be hardly necessary in the light of recent history to argue thatalliances are preferable to isolation. The United States with the protection oftwo oceans and enjoying overwhelming supremacy throughout the western hemisphere-sphere, with a peace-loving population and a vast isolationist majority have twicein a generation been compelled to take part in wars originating in eastern Europe.It would be folly, therefore, to suppose that Great Britain, separated from Europeonly by a narrow channel, and with liabilities in every continent, could success-fully pursue a policy which has proved impracticable for America. It must alsonow be obvious that if an alliance had previously existed between those nations which the aggression of the Axis has united, that aggression would not havetaken place and the war would have been avoided. The question therefore to be answered is not whether Great Britain should have allies but rather what alliesGreat Britain should have........5. It is important before proceeding to the selection of allies to have a cleardefinition of the end in view. Any British statesman, if asked during the presentcentury what was the main object of British foreign policy, could and probablywould have truthfully replied that it was the avoidance of war. So profound was our self-confidence that we had forgotten that a fate worse than war can befall a country, namely defeat. The year 1940 should have brought us so close to thatdisaster as to prevent us from ever again dismissing the possibility. To main-tain peace and, if peace goes, to ensure victory should, it is submitted, be the basisof British foreign policy.6. Of the great Powers likely to survive this war the one that will have suffered least and which will therefore emerge the strongest will be the UnitedStates of America. It is also the Power with which Great Britain has most in common. &apos; Ties of blood and tradition, community of language, acceptance of similar religious and political beliefs render the possibility of war between thetwo peoples almost unthinkable. There exists, however, a very broad chasmbetween the maintenance of friendly relations and the conclusion of an offensive and defensive alliance. I am in no position to offer an opinion as to the probability of the United States adopting after the war commitments which they have consistently refused to undertake throughout their history, but however closely&quot;they may be prepared to link their fate with ours, such an association will notalone suffice to solve all the problems of foreign policy with which we shall be confronted.7. As a general rule agreements should be confined to matters of equalinterest to both parties. World peace is of equal importance to the United Statesand the British Empire, but the futures of Belgium and of Mexico, for instance,save in so far as they affect world peace, are matters of which the importancevaries considerably when approached from a European or an American angle.Only in the Pacific have both Great Britain and the United States vital interests,and it would therefore seem wise for agreements between the two countries toextend to the world in general and to the Pacific in particular.8. This would not absolve either of them from having an European and an american policy respectively. The idea that Great Britain having concluded an alliance with the United States could afford to turn her back on Europe will no more bear examination than the policy of isolation. Great Britain has interestsin the Mediterranean, in North Africa, and in the Middle East, which she can never afford to surrender, and the invention of flying which has enormouslydetracted from the advantages of Great Britain&apos;s insular position has alsorendered her more than ever a part of the continent with which her fortunesmust be indissolubly linked.9. Throughout her history as a Great Power it has been the policy of GreatBritain to prevent the domination of Europe by any one too powerful nation. In )accordance with that policy we have found ourselves successively at war with spain, France, and Germany, and by adherence to that policy we have retainedour independence and built our Empire. It may therefore be assumed that that policy will be maintained in the future, for to abandon it would be to sign ourown death warrant.10. If it be granted that Great Britain must beware of any Power thattends to exercise dominion over Europe, the ineluctable logic of events compelsus to acknowledge that in the period that follows the war Great Britain mustbeware of Russia. The fact that the Bolshevist menace was rightly, in myopinion, termed a bogy, i.e., something that exists only in the imagination of the
fearful, should not blind us to the reality of the Russian danger by which it hasbeen succeeded. Because we can feel confident that the British people were neverlikely to accept the gospel of Karl Marx there is no reason why we should feelequally confident that Russia may not succeed, where others have only narrowlyfailed, in subjugating by force the free nations of Europe.11. Russia has a population more than twice as numerous as that ofGermany. She possesses resources both of food and raw materials,- largelyundeveloped, which might render her almost independent of foreign imports. Incourage and endurance her people are second to none. She has but latelyembarked on a programme of development which is likely to transform a mainlyagricultural into a mainly industrial population. She has adopted a system ofgovernment which combines the efficiency of totalitarianism with an ideologywhich appeals to the hearts of the people, and which they have accepted withthe enthusiasm,with which men embrace a religious faith. This same faith has created for Russia in every country a body of supporters, such as are commonlycalled in these days a fifth column, consisting of young,, vigorous and altruisticfanatics, for whom communism fills the place both of religion and of patriotism,and whose convictions have been confirmed by Russia&apos;s successful performancein the war. It would be difficult to over-estimate the potential menace which allthese advantages create.12. There will doubtless be some who, approaching politics without sufficientknowledge of history or a just appreciation of what is practicable, will argue thatif Russia be very powerful it is with Russia that we should make an alliance inorder to obtain security. Similarly, there were those in the past who favoured an alliance with Hitler, with the Kaiser, with Napoleon, with Louis XIV andwith Philip of Spain. But the alliance of the wolf and the lamb is ever an uneasypartnership and the advantages accruing to the lamb are apt to prove temporary.To promote friendly relations and to conclude treaties of non-aggression with thePower most likely to aggress is obviously desirable, but to rely upon thepermanence of such agreements or the observation of such treaties is unwise.We have such relations and such a treaty with Russia to-day. By all means leteverything be done to continue and to improve those relations and to prolong the duration of that treaty, but let not such efforts blind us to the facts, howeverunpleasant they may appear. Everything was done before this war to promotefriendly relations with Germany, with whom we concluded a treaty at Locarnoand reinforced it by an agreement signed with Hitler at Munich in 1938. Buttwo wars should have sufficed to convince us that the safety of the. British empire should be based on more solid foundations than kind w^ords and scraps of papercan provide.13. It is to be hoped, and indeed to be assumed with some confidence, thatthe mistake will not be repeated of allowing Germany, intact, to rearm underthe eyes of her victors, and to repeat within another twenty years the crime forwhich she was insufficiently punished, in 1919. Without enquiring here into themeasures that will be adopted to secure the lasting subjection of Germany, it istaken for granted that she will not be allowed again to acquire the status of a world Power. The presence, however, in the centre of Europe of this warlikebut docile people must constitute a danger to peace and a temptation to any who might feel disposed to make use of their services as belligerents. Mortal hatrednow divides Russia from Germany, but human emotions, whether of love or hate,of gratitude or revenge, have seldom proved durable in politics and have playedbut a small part in the. affairs of nations. It would, indeed, be rash to rely upon sentiment alone to prevent a Russo-German alliance which would certainlypresent the most formidable menace that Europe has ever had to face. Apartfrom hatred, there is nothing but Poland to divide Russia from Germany, andtherefore the stronger and more prosperous that Poland becomes the better forthe peace of the world.14. While, however, it would be foolish to ignore the Russian danger, itwould be equally foolish to exaggerate it, and to allow our clear vision to becomeclouded by suspicion. There is nothing in the short history of the U.S.S.R. tosuggest that they harbour aggressive designs on their neighbours or nurseambitions of either European or world conquest. The ardour of the Communistcrusade seems to have cooled at the centre if we may judge by the abolition ofthe Comintern. The Russians have suffered terribly in the&apos;war, and the develop-ment of their own empire will provide ample scope for the energies of the[27883] b 2
Russian people for many years to come. There is no reason why that empirewhen developed should not become as self-supporting, as self-satisfied, and aspacific as the United States have long been. Russia has never wanted eithercolonies or Lebensraum, and the true creed of communism is one of peace ratherthan of war. There exist, therefore, good grounds for hope that fears of Russiamay prove illusory. But hope does not provide a satisfactory basis for policy,and preparations should always envisage the worst rather than the besteventualities.15. Poland has been mentioned as the barrier between Russia andGermany, and the importance of a powerful Poland has been emphasised, buthow little Great Britain can assist Poland in time of war was proved in 1939.The experiences of Poland and Czechoslovakia are not likely to make eastern european nations over-anxious to obtain British guarantees, and we should bewell advised to limit the issue of such guarantees in future to those territorieswhere they can be made effective.16. The conquest of the air has reduced but not eliminated the importanceof geography. One glance at a map of the world should convince the observerthat the nations situated on the western seaboard of Europe have interests so closely in common as to render the desirability of their mutual understanding andintimate co-operation plainly apparent. Dissension between Great Britain andFrance must prove as fatal to western Europe as dissension between the Statesof New York and Massachusetts would prove to America, and the iberian peninsula is not less important to the western democracies than is Florida tothe United States. Common interests form the best basis for lasting friendship.If in addition to common interests there exist also similar political and religiousoutlooks we have present all the ingredients of a firm and lasting alliance.17. France has for long been the most important Power on the westerncontinent of Europe, and although doubts have been expressed there seems good reason to suppose that after the war she will recover her importance. Her prestigewill have&apos;suffered ow-ing to her defeat in 1940, her population will for long be seriously diminished owing to the years of imprisonment inflicted upon her youngand middle-aged manhood; her wealth will be greatly reduced owing to thedepredations of the enemy, and the extent to which her industry and agriculturemay suffer as the result of battle remains to be seen. But if we compare her fatewith that of her fellow countries it will not be found that, proportionately, she willhave lost much more than most of them. No European country from the Russianfrontier to the English Channel, from the Arctic Ocean to the Mediterranean, will emerge from this war with enhanced prestige. So far as man-power is concerned,France will have suffered far fewTer casualties than any of the major belligerents,and the shortage due to captivity will not make itself felt for nearly twenty years.The wealth of France has been in the past mainly attributable to two causes : thefertility of the soil, and the intelligence and industry of the people. Neither ofthese sources of wealth has been impaired and it is permissible to believe that thehumiliation through which a proud nation has passed will inspire her people with greater energy and increased determination. After her defeats in 1815and in 1870 France surprised the world by the rapidity of her recovery, and on each occasion this recovery was marked by colonial expansion which resulted inthe creation of a colonial empire the second largest in the world. It is remark-able that in spite of her disasters and divisions in this war she should have beenable to retain her Empire intact, and it is certain that that Empire is still capableof great development. The passage from England to Algiers has already beenaccomplished in three and a half hours. When it is found that the climate and amenities of North-Western Africa are greatly superior to those of SouthernFrance and Southern Italy, and that it is almost equally accessible, it is likely that tourist traffic alone will play an important part in imperial development,and that the vast cities with which the Roman Empire covered the shores of north africa will rise again from their ruins.18&apos;. Those whose duty it will be to bring about the reconstruction of Francewill be forced first of all to find an ally who will both assist them in the task andwill also confer upon them that indispensable security which, as Marshal Fochso plainly stated at the time, was denied to them by the Treaty of Versailles. Itis sometimes lightly said that France must always turn to Great Britain when sheneeds an ally because she has no other choice. But this is far from the truth. Ifthey are ever brought to trial the defence of politicians such as Laval, Doriot, andDeat will surely be that at some period, probably 1936, but possibly before or after,
they came to the conclusion that the friendship of Great Britain, who refused toenter into a firm alliance, was of little value, that a nation so blind to the Germanmenace and so unwilling to make the necessary preparations to meet it mightquite possibly refuse to fight when the moment came, and that therefore the wisestpolicy for France was to make friends with the enemy even though by doing so she were reduced to the position of a second- or a third-rate Power, to which in anycase her dwindling population and her corrupt Administration seemed to beconducting her. They may further argue that if their policy had been followed and France had been willing sincerely to collaborate with Germany she could have avoided the war and retained her Empire and her independence, while sink-ing in the hierarchy of nations to the level of Belgium or Holland.19. It is unlikely that after the war those Frenchmen who still remain infavour of an alliance with Germany will be in a position to advocate it, but thereis no reason why they should not transfer their advocacy to an alliance with thePower which will have succeeded to Germany&apos;s predominance on the continent,namely, to Russia. And if they do so they will know where to look for supporters.In the Chamber that was elected in 1936 there were 82 Communist members, andthere is no reason to suppose that the strength of the party has diminished. Sinceshe was attacked by Germany in 1941, Russia has proved an invaluable ally toGreat Britain, but it would be folly to allow admiration to obscure facts, and itis difficult to see in what way a Europe dominated by Russia with France as herfaithful ally would, from the British of view, be in any wray preferable to aEurope dominated by Germany exercising an uneasy and incomplete control overa recalcitrant and rebellious France.20. The smaller but important Powers of western Europe will probably follow the lead of France. Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium have paid a heavyprice for independence and are not likely to repeat the experiment. Their onedemand will be for security and they, like France, will have two ways of obtainingit. They would obviously prefer the friendship of the great sea Power situated sonear to their own coasts to that of the great land Power at the eastern extremity ofEurope. But if they are met merely by vague promises and assurances of friend-ship on the one hand, whereas definite undertakings and treaties ready for signature are presented on the other, they may w7ell feel that they have more to fear from the rejuvenated colossus of the east, whose policy is a riddle and whoseshort past affords no clue to her future, than from the old mistress of the seaswhose rule has proved so gentle, and who cannot be suspected of harbouringaggressive designs on the integrity of any of her neighbours. In such circum-stances they would be tempted to seek safety from the source of danger rather than from the fountain of goodwill.21. I venture, Sir, therefore to submit to you that no unnecessary time be lost, first, in reaching a decision with regard to our future policy, and, secondly,in acquainting those concerned with our decision. I submit also that that policy should bp directed towards the formation of a group of the western democracies,bound together by the most explicit terms of alliance. That the nucleus of that group should be the Powers that have fought and suffered together GreatBritain, France, Belgium, Holland, Norway and Denmark. There is no reason why it should not subsequently be extended to Sweden, to Portugal and Spain, andto Italy, but I would suggest that in every case we must be satisfied that the countryto be included has adopted genuinely democratic institutions.22. In this connection consideration should be given to the desirability of adding yet one other State to the Alliance, namely, a separate and independentrepublic of the Rhineland, which would be permanently severed from Germany.The measure of its independence and the control of its armamants would, at firstin any case, be matters for the decision of the Allied democracies, but its good faith and loyalty, based on the material advantages accruing to it from itsassociation with its western neighbours wTould both strengthen the latterstrategically, and render it practically impossible for what was left of the Reichto indulge again in aggression.23. An alliance of the kind envisaged would exercise tremendous power.Small as is the space occupied upon the map of Europe by the western democraciesthe combined empires of Britain, France, Holland, Belgium, Portugal and Italycover a vast portion of the earth&apos;s surface and an enormous population. their resources in raw materials represent a very important part of the world&apos;s suppliesof tin, rubber, iron, copper, oils, and fats. These small countries have already somuch in common. They are all highly developed industrially, have imperial[27883] b 3
Gresponsibilities, have many economic links such as their mutual interest in ship-ping, and a large proportion of their pre-war trade was carried on with one another. Nor has the quality of these European peoples deteriorated during thecenturies of their quarrels. In every branch of human endeavour they have beenpre-eminent during the last two thousand years. It would be a bold Power indeedthat would dare to attack them once they were bound together in loyal, firm, and well-organised alliance.24. I would also urge, with greater diffidence, that the old problem ofalliances between nations should be approached from a modern basis which wrilltake into account the revolutionary change in human affairs produced by thediscoveries of physical science. When in the middle of the last centurySir Robert Peel was compelled to return from Rome to London as rapidly aspossible owing to a political crisis it was calculated that the journey took him as long as it would have taken a Roman in the age of the Antonines. An airmanrecently left England in the morning on a reconnaissance flight. He photographedsouthern Poland and the suburbs of Vienna, deposited his pictures in Sicily and returned to Benson the same evening. Man has not yet adjusted his conception of politics to meet the altered conditions of which this incident is an illustration.If Peel were handed the latest map of Europe he would find that it had undergoneless change since his death than it underwent in his life-time. And it is to be feared that many of us bring to the contemplation of that map minds cast in thesame mould as that of Peel, to which it seems natural and not undesirable that this small corner of the earth, which has been termed the Asiatic peninsula, and over which men can fly from end to end in a few hours, should none the less embracemore than a score of nationalities, armies, fleets, flags, and frontiers frequentlylocked in internecine struggles which, if continued indefinitely, can only lead tomutual extinction.25. There is no reason to suppose that finality has been reached in the scienceof explosives. On the contrary, it seems probable that man&apos;s power of destructionmay be immensely developed in the future. If the will to destroy increase withthe power there is no reason why man should not succeed in destroying thecivilisation that exists to-day far more completely than his predecessors succeeded in destroying all the civilisations of the past. For it should be l^emembered that itwas man, not nature, who destroyed the civilisations of Sumeria, Egypt, greece and Rome. From such a fate it seems that only co-operation on the broadestbasis can protect us, and such co-operation can only be produced by greaterenlightenment than now exists. Unfortunately, the. effect of war is to darkenthe minds of men rather than to enlighten them. War increases xenophobic!,intensifies nationalism, breeds suspicion, and stirs up revenge. The morrow ofwar is therefore not the best time to pursue international co-operation on a large scale. To advocate world federation on the day after victory would be merely to invite ridicule. But if the surest mode of progress is to move step by stepit may prove possible while carrying out the policy advocated above to make some-advance towards the more distant goal.26. &apos; The two lines uponwhich the greatest progress might be made are thoseof defence and economics. Within the alliance of western democracies councilsmight be set up on which all the Powers concerned would be represented, and ofwhich the objects would be the integration of the defence forces and the creationof a common economic policy. Whether it would be possible to arrive on theone hand at a single army, fleet, and air force, and, on the other, at the abolitionof all customs barriers and the adoption of a common currency, would remain tobe seen.27. To the question how these proposals are likely to affect the position ofGreat Britain as the senior partner in the Commonwealth of Nations there aretwo answers. In the first place, the Dominions might wish to disassociatethemselves from Europe, or at least to have no definite commitments which would compel them to take any part in European affairs. That is, in fact, the positionthey have occupied since the passing of the Statute of Westminster, and it hasnot prevented any of them, except Eire, from playing their full part in this war.The position of Great Britain would therefore remain unaltered. She would have,as she had in 1939, treaty obligations in Europe and firm friends in the Dominionswho would know that the survival of their own liberties depended upon her.28. On the other hand, there exists the possibility that the smaller nations of western Europe might themselves request to be taken into the BritishCommonwealth, which has, more successfully than any other institution, dealt with
the dilemma of the creation of union and the retention of sovereignty. I under-stand that unofficial overtures in favour of such a development have already beenreceived from highly-placed individuals in more than one of the countries concerned. Such proposals should not be lightly dismissed. It is usually wiser todevelop than to originate, and an experiment that has proved so successful andhas survived the test of the two greatest wars in history would form a solidfoundation for the construction of the most ambitious edifice. If it were successful, as there are good grounds to hope, it might eventually prove to be either the model or the nucleus of that world federation which alone can solve the problems of mankind.29. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Consuls-general at Algiers, Rabat and Dakar, and to the Acting Consul-General at Tunis.I have, &amp;c.DUFF COOPER.Mr. Eden to Mr. Duff Cooper [Algiers).(No. 311. Secret.)Sir, Foreign Office, 2oth July, 1944.I have now considered your important despatch No. 295 of the 30th Mayconcerning our policy in Western Europe and should like to congratulate youon the masterly way in which you have dealt with an issue of profound significanceto this country and to the British Commonwealth of Nations.2. With the first nine paragraphs of your despatch I find myself in complete agreement. In particular it is clear to my mind that any World organisation which may be constituted must be reinforced by various systems of alliances.In parenthesis I would here point out that efforts on the part of some people in this country to foster and strengthen an alliance against Germany and Japanwere in the thirties always impeded by those who declared that such action onour part would only succeed in creating an Axis which might not otherwise havebeen formed.   We must not fall into this type of error again.3. In paragraph 10, however, you proceed to discuss the Russian factorand seem to suggest that the best means of preventing the Soviet Union fromdominating the Continent of Europe would be [a) by the creation of some group in Western Europe and (b) by the establishment of a Poland which would be&apos;&apos; as strong and as prosperous as possible.&quot; It is common ground that this country will be bound to resist an attempt by any other State to achieve the domination of the Continent of Europe. It follows, therefore, that if the Soviet Unionattempted to pursue such a policy we should be bound to resist her by every, means in our power. You rightly point out that there are good grounds for hoping that fears of Russia may prove to be illusory, but you nevertheless suggest that inorder to guard against such dangers, and notably in order to prevent any Russo-German rapprochement, we should have recourse to the measures indicated above.4. It is here that I take issue with your argument. I would not, of course,suggest that there is no danger of the Soviet Union pursuing a policy of expansion in Europe, but I feel strongly that the policy suggested by you would increasethat danger (if it exists) rather than diminish it. It is above all important thatany proposals for closer association between ourselves and the Western european allies or even with the States of Western Europe should be for the sole purposeof preventing a renewal of German aggression. It would be fatal, as I see it,to let it be understood that there is any other purpose in such an association.If we did so, we should be throwing away the considerable chances of the U.S.S.R.pursuing a policy of collaboration after the war, and, more than that, we shouldbe risking the deployment against us in Europe of Russia&apos;s immense capacity forpower politics and disruption. Not only, indeed, would the Russians try toprevent the formation of our system of alliances by all means in their power(and they have very considerable means in their power) but also the States of western Europe, confronted by the stark alternative of choosing between ourselves and Russia, might hesitate to commit themselves and adopt the policyof terrified neutrality, or alternatively of appeasement, which characterised thedismal period between the wars. All this would mean the end of the &apos;&apos; world organisation &apos;&apos; and of the hopes of European recovery.
5. If, therefore, any healthy system is to be built up in Western Europe and on this I shall have more to say later it must be squarely based (a) on theAnglo-Soviet alliance, (b) on an expressed intention never again to permit the revival of a powerful Germany, and (c) if possible within the ambit of a world organisation, itself resting on an alliance, or close understanding, between theUnited Kingdom, the United States and the U.S.S.R.6. I now come to your second proposal, namely, that a powerful poland should be created to act as &quot; a barrier between Russia and Germany &quot; and yourstatement that &quot; apart from hatred, there is nothing but Poland to divide Russiafrom Germany and therefore the stronger and more powerful Poland becomesthe better for the peace of the world.&quot; Essential though it is that the firstnation which took up arms against Hitler should have a truly free and inde-pendent national life, I suggest that this judgment reverses historical facts.Poland, whether free or partitioned, has for 150 years been a link between Prussiaand Russia rather than a barrier. It was, indeed, the means by which Bismarcksecured from Russia that assent to the creation of a unified Germany which she had refused in 1848-49. And it was the tension between Russia and Poland thatwas a cause of the failure to bring Russia to our side in 1939. A Poland on good terms with the Soviet Union might have a chance of being strong, indepen-dent and prosperous : a Poland on bad terms with the Soviet Union would bea danger to the peace of the world and the security of these islands.7. With paragraph 16 to the end of this despatch, on the other hand, Ifind myself in very general agreement, though the extent to which we can work towards &quot; the formation of a group of the western democracies bound togetherby the most explicit terms of alliance &quot; is in practice limited by various factors.In the first place we have to consider our relations with the United States.There is no doubt that, rightly or wrongly, the American Administration issuspicious of proposals which would tend, in their opinion, to divide up theworld into a series of &quot; blocs.&quot; Not only do they fear that such blocs wouldbecome -mutually hostile, but they also believe that their formation would tendto reinforce those isolationist elements in the United States who are above allanxious that their country should undertake no commitments in Europe, but rather concentrate on preserving its power and influence in South America, andpossibly in the Ear East as well.8. Whatever justification there may be for these fears, the fact remainsthat only by encouraging the formation of some World Organisation are welikely to induce the Americans and this means the American Senate to agreeto accept any European commitments designed to range America, in case of need,against a hostile Germany or against any European breaker of the peace. Itis quite on the cards, indeed, many would say that it is likely, that the AmericanSenate will never enter into such general obligations; but the chance remains,and so long as it does it would be folly to throw it away by undue emphasis onpolicies which cut across the lines on which the present American Government is working. For there is surely no doubt that in the event of our obtaining suchan obligation there would be small reason to fear German or indeed any otheraggression in Europe for a long period to come.9. The immediate and declared pursuit of the policy recommended by you in paragraph 21 of your despatch would hence only be desirable if we decidedthat it was useless to expect any American guarantee of the European peace settlement, and had to make do with that settlement being guaranteed by us andour friends on the one hand and by Soviet Russia and her friends on the other.In that, perhaps likely, event, how could we best organise a western group suchas you contemplate ? In the first place, presumably, we should have bilateral ormultilateral treaties of mutual defence against Germany. Such treaties wouldbe the foundation of the whole system, and indeed there would be every advantage in our working discreetly towards them in the period during whichwe shall be uncertain whether a World Organisation, with its necessary commit-ment on the part of America, is going to come into being or not. In any case,there should be no more difficulty about grafting them on to the world organisation than there was in grafting the Locarno treaties on to the Leagueof Nations. Such a system would of course not have to take German susceptibilites-bilities into account, as Locarno did, and would go further than Locarno by providing for staff talks, common plans for defence and so on. If, in addition,it were possible to standardise armaments and armaments production, it is evident that the total strength of the group will be very considerably increased.
10. But as I see it you aim higher than this, and contemplate what wouldbe a sort of union, at any rate in the economic sphere. Though this is perhapsoutside my province, I rather question whether we could arrive at anything likean economic union unless we had a political union as well; and whether we shallall of us be ready for a political union, even after the present war, seems to meto be open to the gravest doubt. You will already have noticed thatM. Van Kleffens has publicly repudiated Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;s suggestion thatHolland, among others, might join the British Commonwealth of Nations. as for France, I cannot imagine that if (for instance) the Prime Ministers offer of1940 was extended to a Provisional Government under General de Gaulleit would have the slightest chance of acceptance. In all these circumstances itrather looks as if plans for some closely integrated Western Union would bedoomed to failure. Only in the event of real friction between the Soviet Govern-ment and this country would it seem to come into the field of practical politics.For then the Western European countries might conceivably become so frightenedthat they would agree to the abandonment of their respective sovereignties unless, indeed, as suggested above, they adopted the rather easier path ofrelapsing into a terrified neutrality.11. I observe that, in your view, the Western system, whatever it may turnout to be, ought to consist not only of ourselves and France and the minor western allies but also, perhaps subsequently, of Sweden, Portugal, Spain and Italy.With Portugal, of course, we already have an alliance and with the other Statesmentioned it might well be possible to concert regional measures for defence against Germany; but if I am right in holding that even a modified form of union would be impossible between ourselves and France, it would a fortiori be impos-sible between ourselves and Spain and Italy. It is a matter for debate, and for subsequent investigation by the economic authorities, to what extent, if at all,and in default of any measure of political union, the States mentioned could be grouped for economic purposes. One of the main troubles, as it seems to me,would be that, on the one hand, we cannot treat these States as the RussianSocialist Federal Soviet Republic treats its fellow-members of the U.S.S.R., and,on the other hand, it seems almost out of the question that both we and they shouldjointly agree on the creation of a sort of Western European District of Colombia.If we could do either of these things, then, and only then, should we establish a power factor equal in every way and perhaps superior to our two great Allies.And if we did so there would be every reason to try to absorb in it an independentRhineland Republic, or even a larger slice of Western Germany. But in default of this it appears to me that we can only build up from the bottom, in other words, on the basis of common defence against the renewal of German aggression.12. There is one final consideration. Unless we are very careful we shall find that the natural corollary to a Western group under our aegis is the creationof a similar group under Russia&apos;s aegis, implying the division of Europe into thespheres of influence with Germany as a no-man&apos;s-land in between. To some extentthis progress is inevitable, in so far as Russia is clearly aiming at some system in eastern Europe in which she would take the lead. The Soviet-Czech treaty is thefirst step in this direction, and it has been left open for signature by other States,and specifically by Poland. In any case, so long as the centripetal force holdingour Western group together is fear of Germany all will be well. But will that fearlast? Germany will be at great pains to exorcise it and she may succeed soonerthan it would seem possible at the present moment. In that case any Westerngroup would tend to disintegrate unless a new cement were found to keep ittogether and the only possible cement that I, and indeed you, can see would be the fear of an aggressive and expansionist Russia. As I have already said, a Westerngroup formed on such a basis would be a disastrous development, since it would lead to the division of Europe into two hostile camps with Germany in a positionto throw her weight on either side.13. To sum up, a Western group would be welcome as part of any organisation to be set up by Britain and Russia, in the first instance, for theprotection of Europe against a new German aggression; but a Western grouporganised as a defensive measure against the possibility of Russia embarkingat some future date on a policy of aggression and domination would be a most dangerous experiment which might well precipitate the evils against which itwas intended to guard.
14. From the political point of view, therefore, I suggest that our policy should be directed towards establishing some kind of defence system in western europe whether we are successful in creating a World Organisation or not. Ifwe are unsuccessful the need for it will be immeasurably greater. The strategicalissues involved in such a policy are now under consideration by the Chiefs ofStaff, and we must await their views before elaborating our policy in any greater detail. The economic issues, too, will have to be the subject of more intensivestudy. In the meantime I trust I have sufficiently indicated our main politicalends and the means whereby we may hope to achieve them.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.
