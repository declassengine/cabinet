NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   Sabang has been heavily bombarded by the Eastern Fleet.U.S. marines have landed on Guam after successive attacks by carrier-borne aircraft and naval bombardment.Weather has again restricted unloading in the Normandy assault area.Coastal forces have been active in the Mediterranean.Two LT-boats have been sunk and two possibly sunk.Home Waters.2. Strong winds and swell on several days of the week have again interfered with the sailing of convoys and unloading in the assault area. The totalsunloaded up to p.m. on the 25th are : 1.487,767 men. 311,566 vehicles and 1,421.183tons of stores.3. On the 25th, H.M.S. Erebus (monitor) bombarded batteries in theHoulgate area, and the Dutch gunboat Flares engaged mortar positions west ofCabours.o4. Shipping in the U.S. anchorage was bombed on the 27th : there were 13casualties in two ships, which were undamaged.5. On the night of the 21st/22nd. H.M. ships Melbreak (destroyer) andTorrington (frigate) intercepted an Elbing class destroyer with four E-boats on anortherly course off Cap cFAntifer. The enemy was damaged by shellfire but,though subsequently engaged by aircraft, coastal forces and shore batteries, theysucceeded in escaping through the Strait of Dover. The destroyer was later seenat Rotterdam. On the following night H.M. ships Forester (destroyer) andStayner (frigate) with three M.T.Bs.. between Cap d&apos;Antifer and Fecamp,attacked ten R-boats, and damaged three of them. Forester was slightly damaged by the fire of coastal batteries and sustained 15 casualties.6. On the night of the 19th/20th, six M.T.Bs., including two NorwegianM.T.Bs., damaged two trawlers off Terschelling : one M.T.B. received damage.On the following night M.T.Bs. off Scheveningen sank one trawler and probably sank another : two M.T.Bs. sustained slight damage.7. H.M.C.S. Malane (frigate) w7as damaged by air attack on the night ofthe 20th/21st off Brest and was towed to port. H.M.S. Isis (destroyer) was sunkeither by mine or torpedo on the same night in the assault area. H.M.S. Chamois(dahiayer) was damaged by mine on the 21st in the eastern assault area. H.M.S.Goathland (group H.Q. ship) was mined and damaged in the assault area on the24th. In heavy weather, on the 21st, 11 L.C.M. were sunk on passage from the assault area.Mediterranean.8. H.M. S/M Universal, in the Gulf of Lions, on the 14th, sank a south-bound schooner of 350 tons south of Port Vendres under the fire of shore batteries.9. M.T.Bs. on the night of the 16th/ 17th, sank an F-lighter off Monte Carlo.On the following night coastal forces, operating off the Riviera and in the gulf of Genoa, sank a patrol boat and a barge, torpedoed a corvette, a tanker and anF-lighter, damaged an R-boat and an F-lighter and drove another lighter ashore.On the night of the 18th/19th, coastal forces torpedoed and set on fire a coaster inMentone harbour. U.S. M.T.Bs. in the Gulf of Genoa sank one F-lighter and leftanother on fire on the night of the 20th/21st.10. At Leghorn on the 24th the enemy shelled blockships in the harbour inan attempt to interfere with clearance work.11. In the Adriatic on the night of the 17th/18th, coastal forces attacked a convoy in the Ml jet Channel off the Yugoslavian coast. One E-boat and anI-boat were sunk and two lighters were damaged. On the night of the 23rd/24th,coastal forces attacked a convoy in Korcula Channel.The first convoy arrived at Ancona on the 23rd.
West Atlantic.12. The Brazilian naval auxiliary Vital cle Oliveira was torpedoed and sunk on the 20th E.N.E. of Rio de Janeiro.  Seventy survivors were rescued.East Indies.13. Early on the 25th, the port and town of Sabang were attacked by Alliedships of the Eastern Fleet including H.M. ships Queen Elizabeth, Valiant andRenown, the French battleship Richelieu, seven cruisers and ten destroyers. Com-plete surprise was achieved. H.M. ships Illustrious and Victorious with .M.S. Phoebe (cruiser) operated some 30 miles north-west of Sabang. After astrike by fighters from the carriers, the ships opened a bombardment and, in alittle more than half an hour, a total of 294 rounds of 15&quot;, 134 rounds of 8&quot; and upwards of 300 rounds of 6&quot; were fired by the battleships and cruisers at meanranges of 18,000 yards and 8.000 yards respectively; destroyers fired at ranges of6.000 to 3,000 yards.An. inshore force consisting of the Dutch cruiser Tromp, IT.M. ships Quilliam,^^^^J^and^fe &quot;tJ.0.0. Zuji&apos;&amp;&quot;(destroyers) entered the harbour and carried out a---&quot;bombardment at close range, firing 1,250 rounds of 5-9&quot; and 4-7&quot; in addition toa large number of 3&quot; and torpedoes.Two enemy aircraft were destroyed during the operation. Of a small numberof aircraft which later attempted to attack the carriers, three were shot dowuiand two others damaged.ELM. Neth. S. Tromp sustained some damage from shore batteries but no casualties. H.M. ships Quality and Quilliam- were also damaged and suffered tencasualties. One Corsair was lost, the pilot being saved, and five other Corsairswere damaged.Pacific.marinas.14. On the 20th, U.S. marines landed on Guam after 17 successive days of bombing by carrier-borne aircraft and bombardment by ships, includingbattleships. The aircraft on the three preceding days flewr a total of 2,900 sorties.Between the 17th and the 24th, 4,068 sorties were flown against Guam and Rota.Eleven aircraft were lost.On the 24th, follov/ing a bombardment in which a battleship took part,U.S. marines landed on palestinian Island.New Guinea and New Ireland.15. On the night of the 19th/20th, a U.S. destroyer shelled enemy positions on Karawapop Island (west of Dutch New Guinea).On the 20th, H.M. Australian cruisers bombarded positions east of Aitape.On the two succeeding nights Allied destroyers and M.T.Bs. shelled military transport, a bridge and gun positions and a supply depot between Wewak andAitape.  A number of enemy barges have been sunk or damaged during the week.On the night of the 21st/22nd, Allied gunboats sank two small craft off thesouth-west coast of New Ireland.Anti-Submarine Operations.16. Thirty-seven attacks were reported during the week. Of these, 28 wereby shore-based aircraft and nine by warships.On the 18th, west of Narvik, one U-boat was sunk by a Catalina and another was possibly sunk by a Liberator. On the same day a U-boat was sunk offStart Point, probably by frigates of the 1st Escort Group. H.M. ships Ekinsand Curzon (frigates) possibly sank one in the eastern Channel on the 21st.Enemy Intelligence.17. Photographic reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 24th showed that theScheer and Eugen had arrived since the 19th and the nurnberg had sailed.Reconnaissances during the week of ports between Brest and Ostend showed atotal of 21 E/R boats, one torpedo-boat, two corvettes, 19 motor minesweepers,23 tank landing craft and one U-boat (in dock at Havre) in addition to auxiliaryvessels.,[27903] &apos; B
18. It is reported that the Eugen with three destroyers is to form adetached Abo squadron, probably for the defence of the Aaland Islands and theprotection of the Bothnia supply routes. It is further reported that theremainder of the German Fleet (two pocket battleships, one 8&quot; cruiser and four6&quot; cruisers) are to form a squadron under Admiral Kummetz, probably toblockade the Gulf of Finland against the Russian Fleet and to cover any militaryevacuation by sea from the Baltic States.U-boats.19. In the Channel U-boats are believed to have been patrolling during theweek on the convoy routes. There are indications that two U-boats have leftpatrol in the Caribbean. Another is south-east of Rio de Janeiro and one issouth-west of St. Helena, probably on passage to the Indian Ocean.20. There has been evidence for some time that the Germans may intend to close down Bordeaux as a major U-boat base. The completion of shelters atBergen and Trondheim is being pressed forward and more small Norwegianports are being used as makeshift bases. At Trondheim covered pens for sevenU-boats are completed and a second pen is under construction. At Bergen pensfor ten boats are being built: a part for two boats is already complete.21. Experiments in the deep firing of torpedoes have been carried out sincethe end of 1943. It is reported that the torpedo tubes of standard type U-boatshave been modified to enable torpedoes to be fired at depths of as much as20/25 fathoms.Enemy Attack on Shipping.22. One ship is reported to have been attacked by U-boat during the week:a U.S. ship was torpedoed south-east of Rio de Janeiro.E-boats attacked a convoy bound to the assault area off Dungeness andtorpedoed two ships. One ship was damaged by an underwater explosion in the assault area.Two coasters in convoy were mined and sunk south-east of Ancona.Protection of Seaborne Trade.23. During the week ending the 23rd, 852 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 411 were in ocean convoys and 441 in British coastal convoys. Three escort carriers, 38 destroyers (including 18 U.S. destroyers) and79 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties. Sixhomebound convoys, consisting of 286 ships, and four outward-bound convoys,consisting of 125 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.24.   Mines have been laid by surface craft off the west coast of France..Aircraft have laid mines in the Baltic, and the Frisian Islands and the biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.25. In the assault area about 100 aircraft were engaged in minelaying onthe night of the 19th/20th. minelaying has also taken place in the westernapproach channel during the week and is suspected in a large area between the twochannels extending to some 30 miles offshore. A total of 55 mines has been sweptduring the week : 25 of them on the 20th. In the Cherbourg area several minesof various types have been destroyed, including moored mines with delay-actionsinkers in the Grande Rade.26. E-boats are suspected of minelaying on one night off the South-East coast and a dangerous area has been declared.The approach channels to Leghorn have been swept.The mine totals are 5,217 ground and 5,434 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.27. Since the 11th five troop convoys, each consisting of four or five ladentransports, have sailed from southern Norway.
Turkish Merchant Shipping.28. As a result of two attacks on Turkish ships inside territorial waters byan unidentified submarine, all movements of Turkish shipping in the Black Seahave been suspended.MILITARY situation the Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.29. The Russians have reached the Finnish frontier north of Lake Ladoga.Northern Sector.30. The Russian offensive has spread to the Gulf of Finland, where Narvawas taken on the 26th. Pskov was captured on the 23rd, two days after Ostrovhad fallen. As a result, the Russians are now across the whole Eastern frontier of Latvia. On the 25th they thrust forward as far as the railway Dvinsk-Riga,thus cutting the last remaining railway from Dvinsk, since the line running-westwards from the town had already been cut.Central Sector.31. After pausing at the Nieman for about a week, the Russians haveresumed their advance N.W. of Grodno. They are now very close to Bialystokand, after by-passing Brest Litovsk on the north and south they are within some50 miles of Warsaw. Brest Litovsk itself is at the end of a long salient, and russian troops are only a few miles from the town. After taking Lublin on the24th, the Russians pressed forward to Deblin and hold a stretch of the east bankof the Vistula south of the town.Southern Sector.32. The impetus of their offensive, begun on the 15th, has carried theRussian troops across the whole of the River Bug, from Brest Litovsk southwards,-apparently unhindered by the fortifications which the Germans are believed tohave built there. Already the Russians have reached the River San west of RowaRuska, and have even forced a crossing at a few points. Lwow has beenencircled and a battle is in progress in the town, and the front of the russian advance has now been spread to the Stanislavov area. The railway running westfrom Stanislavov has been cut by a thrust from the north.General.33. Although here and there the Russians have been checked for a time asat Dvinsk and on the Nieman their advance on the front as a whole continueswithout interruption. During the past week the most important feature has beenthe rapid increase in the threat to Warsaw, but the fact that the Russians haveforced the River San and reached the Vistula may prove to be scarcely less important, since these two rivers form the last good defence line east of theGerman frontier.North-West France.  (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.34. Up to the 24th, there had been little change in the U.S. sector, but a major attack, which was launched on the 25th, to the west of St. Lo has made good progress.In the British sector, the armoured thrust to the east of Caen having beenhalted by the strong enemy defensive positions and bad weather, operations were largely confined to consolidation and regrouping until the 25th, when canadian troops attacked south, astride the Caen-Falaise road.U.S. Sector.35.   The offensive of the First U.S. Army which had been-gradually slowing down had virtually come to a standstill by&apos; the 20th and, apart from a local[27903] B 2
probing attack on the 22nd across the River Seves to the north of Periers, which met with little success, a lull ensued for the greater part of the week.On the morning of the 25th, a major attack by infantry and tanks was launched in the sector west of St. Lo which was preceded by a very heavy air bombardment. This attack made good progress on a five-mile front, capturingMarigny and St. Gilles, with advance elements reaching Canisy some two milesfurther south on the following day.The 26th saw a renewal of activity on the remainder of the U.S. front.On the west, an advance from a half to one-and-a-half miles is reportedtowards the Lessay-St. Lo road, which has been reached at a point two miles west of Periers.On the east of the sector similar advances were made between St. Lo andCaumont, the town of Berigny being captured on the 26th.British Sector.36. Despite the initial success of the armoured thrust to the east of Caen,the momentum of the advance which was slowed up by enemy defensive positions and a strong anti-tank screen to the S.E. of Bourguebus, was finally halted bytorrential rain which so softened the ground as to render movement impossibleexcept on metalled roads.During this pause British and Canadian infantry, attacking south on either side of the River Orne, succeeded in capturing Maltot and St. Martin by the 22nd,thus straightening out our line in this sector. Further west, however, a powerfulcounter-attack by enemy infantry and tanks on the night of the 21st/22nd resultedin our losing the village of Esquay.On&quot; the 25th, the advance south of Caen was renewed between St. Martinand Bourguebus, where Canadian troops captured Verriers and reached the outskirts of May-sur-Orne. Very heavy fighting took place in this area where our troops came up against strong enemy defensive positions. A powerfularmoured counter-attack ultimately compelled our withdrawal from May-sur-Orneto a firm line covering St. Martin, Verriers and Bourguebus.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)37. Slow-43Ut steady progress has been maintained along the whole frontthroughout the week.In the Adriatic sector, Polish and Italian forces pushed forward rapidlyfrom Ancona to a line running from Ostra to the coast, thus clearing the Esinovalley. The enemy is now holding up further progress on the line of the MisaRiver.In the area that lies between the coast and Citta Di Castello, the enemy hascarried out withdrawals, which have been followed up by our mobile forces,enabling them to enter Sassoferrato and Gubbio. Indian troops further to the left, who have been pushing forward astride the River Tiber, captured CittaDi Castello on the 22nd and are now two miles away from Sansepolero. The line to the east of Arezzo has been pushed forward in conformity with the generaladvance and our forces are now five miles north of Arezzo along the Bibbienaroad. The left Corps of the Eighth Army has made steady progress; on its right,British formations thrust forward into the foothills of the Apennines and captured San Giovanni, on the road to Florence. Further along the Corps front,a Dominions armoured formation captured Greve on the 24th and continued the advance to the north. On its left, Allied troops north of Poggibonsi, despite thehampering effect of rear guards, demolitions and mines, occupied Castelfiorentinoon the 21st, and pressed northwards, until by the 26th, forward elements were only about nine miles from Florence. San Casciano, the last place of any sizebetween our present positions and Florence, is reported to be held in strengthby the enemy.On the extreme left, U.S. forces have reached the River Arno on a broadfront from San Miniato to Marina Di Pisa. The enemy has blown the bridgesacross the river and in the town of Pisa, the outskirts of which Avere reached onthe 23rd. The town is, therefore, virtually cut in two, with the enemy in thenorthern and the Americans in the southern part of it. Monte Pisano, the massifto the. N.E. of the city, is providing the enemy with an excellent grand standwhence they are shelling and mortaring U.S. troops. Long-range guns arebombarding the port of Leghorn, where the port facilities were found badly damaged.
Yugoslavia.38. In Serbia, Partisan operations designed to secure more suitable bases for attacks upon the main railways have achieved some success. Strong oppositionis being encountered from Cetnik and Bulgarian forces.German forces launched determined attacks in Bosnia in mid-July, as aresult of which the Partisan landing grounds at Osmaci (50 miles N.N.E. ofSarajevo) and Glamoc (80 miles west of Sarajevo) were captured. A similar attack in Montenegro, with the landing ground at Berane as its ultimate objective, washeld by the Partisans.   The latter have counter-attacked east of Andrijevica.Greece.39. Minor activity only has taken place, and the Zervas offensive appearsto have come to an end.Burma.Chin Hills and Chindwin.40. Our troops have made continuous advances southwards from Bishenpurthroughout the week. Enemy resistance has been slight, but progress was slowbecause of the difficult conditions caused by the weather. Many of the streamswhich lay across the path of our troops are now in flood. The troops have now reached a point 17 miles south of Bishenpur on the Imphal-Tiddim road.Pacific Theatre. (An outline map of the Mariana Islands is included as an inset.)M arianas.- 41. U.S. marines have now established two beach-heads on the easternside of the island of Guam; the southernmost one extends for about four miles south of Orote peninsula, which&apos;has now been cut off, and includes Mount Alifan,one mile inland. Cabras, a small island off the coast of Guam has also been occupied..  Progress on palestinian island is reported to have been satisfactory.New Guinea.42. During the 23rd, U.S. artillery broke up three attacks against our positions along the Driniumor River. Japanese attempts to infiltrate across theriver were frustrated.AIR SITUATION.General Review.43. Bomber Command aircraft made two heavy attacks on Stuttgart andone on Kiel; U.S. heavy bombers operated on two days in strength against targets in Central and Southern Germany.Coastal Command Beaufighters made a successful attack on a convoy offHeligoland.In North Italy, enemy communications were attacked. Oil installations andmunition factories were bombed by the M.A.A.F. in the Balkans and SouthGermany.The number of flying-bombs launched showed an increase on the previousweek.United Kingdom.44. No enemy aircraft were reported over this country. Flying-bomb attacks are reported under &apos;&apos; Enemy Activity and Home Security.Home Waters.45. In the wTeek ended midnight on the 26th, Coastal Command aircraft flew 1,001 sorties involving 8,460 flying hours and aircraft of Bomber Commandlaid 188 sea-mines.On the evening of the 21st, 42 Beaufighters made a highly successful attackon a convoy, consisting of about nine merchant ships and 16 escort vessels, offHeligoland; photographs show a 4,000-ton ship and a 2,500-ton ship on fire and sinking, and two 3,000-ton ships, a 2,500-ton ship, a 700-ton coaster, five trawler-type auxiliaries, three M-class minesweepers and an escort vessel to have been seton fire.
sOn the following day, 24 Beaufighters, operating off the Frisian Islands, sank one armed trawler and probably sank another.Three ships, each of about 1,250 tons, entering St. Peter Port, Guernsey,were attacked by six Avengers, resulting in one ship being set on fire and probabledamage to another.Seven Mosquitoes and a Beaufighter, on escort duty off the Brest Peninsula,destroyed six Do. 217, probably destroyed two other aircraft and damaged a ninthfor the loss of one Mosquito.Numerous night attacks by individual aircraft were made on small ships off the coasts of France, Belgium and Holland; results were largely unobservedbut six ships are known to have been damaged.Western Front.46. There was some improvement in the weather during the week and aircraft of the Allied Commands based on the U.K. flew a total of 29,012 sorties and dropped 28,517 tons of bombs compared with 25,632 sorties and 27,721 tonsin the previous week. Enemy casualties in combat and on the ground were 177destroyed, 29 probably destroyed and 93 damaged; Allied losses were 261 aircraftconsisting of 146 heavy bombers, 25 medium and light bombers and 90 fighters.France and Belgium,*47. On the 24th and 25th, forces of about 1,580 Fortresses and Liberatorswere despatched, in support of operations by the U.S. First Army, against tacticaltargets between Periers and St. Lo; a total of 3,576 tons of bombs was dropped,mostly on the second day, bad weather on the 24th having forced a large numberof aircraft to abandon their tasks. Medium and fighter-bombers dropped afurther 863 tons on similar operations.Railway targets were attacked with 3,533 tons of bombs from 2,561 aircraft,the largest single effort being made at night by Bomber Command aircraft which dropped&apos; 1,642 tons on Courtrai railway centre; as a result of the attack, thewhole of the target is devastated. Givors railway junction, near Lyons, received611 tons, also in a night attack, which, despite cloudy weather, is believed tohave&apos;been well concentrated. A number of effective raids was made by medium bombers, particularly on a railway tunnel near Vire and on railway bridges atLaval and Cloyes (near Chartres).Medium and light bombers were also engaged in 11 attacks on fuel andammunition dumps mostly behind the battle area; very good results were achieved on fuel dumps near Bernay, Alencon, Fontainebleau (near Paris) and inthe Foret de Senonches. On successive nights, the 23rd/24th and 24th/25th,Bomber Command aircraft dropped a total of 1,040 tons, and inflicted severe damage on an oil refinery and storage depot at Donges, near St. Nazaire.Over 3,400 tons of bombs were dropped by Halifaxes, Lancasters andMosquitoes in nine day and seven night attacks on flying-bomb sites.Photographs taken of a large site at Wizernes show considerable damage as theresult of a raid on the 20th, and a similar target at Watten, attacked withdelayed-action bombs on the 25th, is also believed to have been effective.Other successful operations included a daylight attack by 98 Lancastersand Mosquitoes on a signals equipment depot at St. Cyr, a small raid by fighter bombers on on enemy H.Q. near Laval, and on Radar stations near Vire,Avranches and Ushant.The Allied effort against airfields was small, the only important operationbeing by 244 Fortresses and Liberators, which made blind bombing attacks on airfields at Creil, Laon and Juvincourt.Over 5,800 sorties were flown by fighters and fighter-bombers on armedreconnaissances and offensive sweeps; 293 railway wagons, 87 M.T., 58 enemy aircraft, 25 tanks, 21 locomotives and four bridges were amongst the targetsdestroyed. A further 1,522 sorties, flown on defensive operations &quot;over the beach-head, destroyed eight enemy aircraft out of the small opposition encountered.Germany\*48. The Allied effort against targets in Germany was on a larger scale than for some weeks past, the U.S. with Air Force having despatched 2,392 heavy bombers by day, and Bomber Command 2,443 aircraft by night. The Fortressesand Liberators, which operated on the 20th and 21st over Central and Southern* The results of some of the attacks referred to above are given in Appendix VII.
Germany, dropped 4.875 tons of bombs in attacks on 11 aircraft factories, twosynthetic oil plants, three ball-bearing works, an M.T. works and the towns ofMunich and.saarbrucken; good bombing results are reported at the ball-bearing-factories at Leipzig, Schweinfurt and Ebelsbach, aircraft and aero-engineassembly plants at Dessau, Leipzig, Gotha, Regensburg, Oberpfaffenhofen andNeuaubing (near Munich), and an M.T. works at Russelheim. From these opera-tions in which 1,474 fighters co-operated, 50 heavy bombers and 19 fighters are missing; 32 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and on the ground.On the nights of the 24th/25th arid 25th/26th, a total of 1,040 aircraft of bomber Command dropped 3,168 tons of bombs in two attacks on Stuttgart;photographs taken on the day of the 26th permit of little interpretation as thetown was still enveloped in thick smoke. Kiel, upon which 2,753 tons were dropped on the night of the 23rd/24th, was partially obscured by thin cloud, butbombing, in the later stages, is believed to have been well concentrated around theaiming point. Forces of between 100 and 150 aircraft bombed synthetic oil plants at Bottrop, Flomberg and Wanne Eickel (near Bochun); very severe damage was done at Homberg, and reports from crews also indicate a successful attack at Bottrop.Night raids, each by forces of about 25 Mosquitoes, were made on fouroccasions on Berlin and twice on Hamburg.In the above operations, Bomber Command losses were 68 aircraft and afurther two which crashed.Mediterranean Front.49. During the week ended dawn on the 25th, Allied aircraft of theM.A.A.F. flew a total of 11,717 sorties, of which 3,171 were heavy bombers, and dropped 6,992 tons of bombs; 109 Allied aircraft are missing and 113 enemy aircraft were destroyed.The Strategic Air Force attacked oil targets in the Balkans and munition factories in South Germany; 63 heavy bombers are missing.Italy.50. The main effort of the Tactical Air Force was concentrated against enemy communications in North Italy, and on military targets in the battle area;operations were, however, somewhat restricted by unfavourable weather.Bridges were attacked by medium and fighter-bombers with very satisfactory results. On the 20th, over 100 Thunderbolts swept the area from Padua toBologna and destroyed two bridges on the railway line, damaged two others, andalso at least 25 units of rolling- stock; four days later the same railway system was attacked by 87 Marauders and four bridges and 61 units of rolling stockwere destroyed and the tracks were cut. Bridges were also destroyed on theRimini/Ravenna/Ferrara route, in the Po valley, in Liguria and at several otherlocations.Fighter-bombers attacked Bergamo airfield and destroyed six grounded air-craft and damaged others. Mestre railway centre was bombed by Liberatorsand good results were reported : Wellingtons and Liberators dropped 235 tons at night on Fiume oil refinery, obtaining a good concentration with direct hitsobserved on oil cisterns.South Germany, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Albania and Poland.51. Heavy attacks by Liberators and Fortresses were made on the synthetic oil refinery at Brux (48 miles N.W. of Prague) and on the Romano america oil refinery at Ploesti when 712 and 1,008 tons of bombs respectively were dropped,,but with unobserved results. A small attack by 42 Liberators was made on theBerat oil refinery (30 miles N.E. of Valona), and, at night, Wellingtons bombed the Pardubice (65 miles E. of Prague) and Prahova (S. of Ploesti) oil refineries.In the Munich area, a well-concentrated attack, causing serious damage, wasmade on the Milbershofen Ordinance Depot (262 tons). Heavy bombers also successfully attacked the Neuaubling aircraft factory (215 tons), Schleissheimairfield (169 tons), the Allach engine works (189 tons) and the Munich railway centre (67 tons). Lightnings carried out an offensive sweep over the Bad/Aiblingairfield and destroyed or damaged eight enemy aircraft on the ground. In these operations 20 heavy Allied bombers and five fighters are missing and seven enemy aircraft were shot down.A total, of 561 heavy bombers attacked targets in the Friedrichshafen area and dropped 981 tons. At Lowenthal airfield the assembly plant, hangars andother buildings were hit.   At Memmingen airfield hangars and buildings were
hit and 18 grounded aircraft were destroyed and 22 others were damaged.Serious damage was caused to the former Zeppelin works, and a heavyconcentration was reported on the Diesel Engine works at Maybach. Ninebombers and two fighters are missing and 19 enemy aircraft were shot down.The Hermann Goering tank works at Linz was attacked by 420 heavy bomberswhich released 1,038 tons; photographs show severe damage to the target and several fires raging.In Rumania, the Iron Gate railway centre and bridge were attacked by20 Fortresses with good results. Airfields at Bunzau and Zilistea (N.E. ofBucharest) were machine-gunned by 72 Lightnings and 46 Mustangs; thesefighters subsequently landed at Russian bases.Fifty-six fighters which attacked an airfield in Poland shot clown 29 enemy aircraft and destroyed nine others on the ground.Yugoslavia.52. Our Balkan Air Force concentrated their attacks on enemy communicate-tions and military targets; 17 M/T vehicles and seven locomotives were destroyed and 22 M/T vehicles and 27 locomotives were damaged. Off the Dalmatian coast,four coastal vessels were destroyed and six were damaged.Successful light-weight attacks were made on the Zenica steel works,Podogorica town and Makarska (30 miles S.E. of Split). The airfield at Kraljerowas bombed and three grounded aircraft destroyed.South France.53..

APPENDIX VII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Attach. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 11th, 12thand 13th July show that in the north-east sector of the Bayerische Motorenwerkethe boiler house, the main offices, an M.T. Section building, a very large workshop,a canteen and several huts have all been more or less severely damaged. Ninemore huts in a hutted camp to the north-east of the factory have been destroyed or damaged.Augsburg. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 16th and19th July cover only the northern part of the Messerschmitt aircraft works. Inthe part covered, however, it can be seen that the offices have been completelygutted, and damage has been done to a large workshop, the experimental flighthangar and other unidentified buildings.Bernburg. Photographs show that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 7th July further damage has been caused to the Junkers works (Ju. 52 and188 assembly). Two flight hangars, the offices and fire station, the gun testingrange and three other small buildings have been damaged, and there are manynew craters on the north-east/ south-west runway and about 150 on the landing ground.  Five, probably six, Ju. 83&apos;s on the airfield have been damaged.Dessau. Photographs show that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the20th July damage has been caused throughout all units of the Junkers Flugzeugund Motor-enwerke.   Damaged buildings include (a) Aero-engine Factory. A workshop, a store, an office building, an air raid shelter and at least eight unidentified buildings.(b) Aircraft assembly Factory. Three assembly shops, two large workshops,seven probable garages, and four small buildings.(c) Junkers and Co. G.m.b.H. The heat treatment and erecting building,stores, and three unidentified buildings.There are many craters on the east/west runway, landing ground and perimeterstrips, and one probable Ju. 88 is seen to be damaged.Ebelsbach. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 21st Julyare of poor scale and quality, but it can be seen that severe damage has been caused to the works of Kugelfischer Schweinfurt (ball bearings). The two largemachine shops have been heavily damaged, as well as the raw materials,inspection and packing shed. Two unidentified buildings have been destroyed and there is probable damage to the transformer and switching gear.Erfurt Airfield. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the20th July show that damage has been caused to all the important buildings. the double Junkers repair hangars and shops have been severely damaged, while twobarrack buildings have been similarly affected. Several other buildings in theimmediate vicinity of these hangars have been destroyed or severely damaged.There is a large concentration of craters on the north side of the landing ground,and seven aircraft (possibly ten) have been damaged.Gelsenkirchen /Buer Synthetic Oil Plant.- Photographs taken on the19th July show that as a result of the Bomber Command attacks on the 9th/10thand 18th/19th July considerable damage has been caused throughout theScholven plant. Camouflage and the poor quality of the prints make detailed assessment difficult, but damaged buildings are seen to include a compressorhouse, the gas cleansing and distillation plants, hydrogenation stalls and injectorhouses, oil storage tanks, gas holders and cooling towers. Many large unidentified buildings in the southern part of the works have been destroyed, while steampipesand roads have been hit throughout the target area.Gotha. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 20th july show damage in all parts of the works of Gothaer Waggon Fabrik A.G. (Me. 110components and assembly). Eleven workshops and two assembly shops have suffered varying degrees of damage, and many of the workshops which were
damaged in the February attack have now been destroyed. In the locomotive,lorry and tank factory four hangars and five other large buildings have been damaged, most of them severely. Some craters have been caused on both thefactory airfield and the G.A.F. airfield.Homberg (Meerbeck) Synthetic Oil Plant. Photographs, taken after thefive Bomber Command attacks between the 11th and 21st July, show that this target, which is one of the largest of the Fischer Tropsch synthetic oil plants,has suffered severe damage to important units. Primary vital parts of the plantdamaged include the blower house, contact oven house and the buildings concernedwith organic sulphur and hydrogen sulphide removal. Amongst buildings com-pletely destroyed are the pump house, two distillation plants, ammonium sulphatepreparation building, Linde plant, Benzole fractionation plant, the condensationand the tar recovery buildings, two gas holders and a large oil storage tank.Major damage is seen to the active carbon plant, the packed products shed anda laboratory.Koethen. Photographs show that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the20th July few buildings of the Junkers factory (Jumo. 211 and 213 engines)have escaped severe damage. Several large workshops, aero engine test beds andthe boiler house are among the many buildings affected. Roads and paths throughthe factory have suffered severely, and rail tracks serving the works have been cut by at least 12 hits. There is considerable business and residential damageclose to the target, and the locomotive shed at Koethen station has been destroyed.Lechfeld Airfield. Photographs show that almost the entire weight of theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 19th July fell on the hangar and workshop area in thesouth-west corner of the airfield (activities in connection with Me. 262). Six ofthe seven hangars have been damaged, four of them having been hit several times,and the workshops have been destroyed. One large four-engined aircraft, threetwin-engined aircraft and two small aircraft which were among a large numberdispersed west of the airfield, have been damaged or destroyed.Leipheim Airfield. Photographs show that as the result of the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 19th July, the main weight has fallen in the area of the hangars and workshops (Me. 262 assembly) just north of the runway. The large repairhangar which had been damaged in a previous attack has again suffered severely.A number of accommodation buildings have also been affected. On the airfield at least two aircraft can be seen to be damaged.Leipzig IMockau. Photographs show that the TJ.S.A.A.F. attack on the20th July caused extensive damage to almost all components of the Erla fighterassembly factory. Both.flight hangars, and two of the three assembly shops havebeen severely damaged, and the offices have been half demolished. Two aircraft can be seen to be damaged.Lutzkendorf. A final interpretation of photographs taken after theU.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 12th and 28th May and 7th July shows that damage is spread throughout the synthetic oil plant. All the vital parts, including theinjector house, gas generating plant and the contact oven houses, have beenpartially destroyed or damaged, and the power house and the brown coal bunkerbuildings have been affected less severely. Thirty-four of the 59 oil storage and intermediate product storage tanks have been destroyed or damaged. Railwaytracks through the plant have been cut in a large number of places.MerseburgjLeuna, Synthetic Oil Plant. Photographs taken after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 20th July show that damage from this attack is concen-trated in two areas in the south and in the north of the works. A large wet gas holder has been completely wrecked and another severely damaged, while otherC important units affected include the hydrogen oven house, the injector house, the gas compression house, the calcium nitrate house, the ammonium nitrate silo, apump house, the main offices and several unidentified buildings.In the marshalling yards and sidings to the south-west, many direct hits have cut most of the tracks and caused considerable damage to rolling-stock; an engineround-house is partially destroyed.Munich. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 11th, 12th,13th and 16th July cover only the Geising and Sendling districts on the southside of the city, where severe business and residential damage has been caused.In this area the town power station has been hit and several small buildings ofthe Agfa factory have been severely damaged, while the slaughter-house has also suffered heavily.
Resulting from these attacks, damage has also been caused to the Munich/Reim G.A.F. and civil airfield. Most of the damage has occurred on the north-west edge of the field where the circular-shaped hangar has received several hits,and an office or barrack building has been almost destroyed. Some craters can beseen on the west side of the airfield.Further photographs of indifferent quality taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 11th, 12th, 13th and 16th July cover the entire city and show heavy damage.There is considerable damage in the built-up area north of the Haupt Bahnhof,and a large amount of fresh damage in the previously damaged areas west andsouth of the Haupt Bahnhof and west of the Isar river. East of the Hindenburg-strasse and north of the Nymphenburgstrasse some 15 city blocks have been heavilyaffected and in the suburbs of Paising and Pipping, west of the city, there isscattered damage. The marshalling yard and main station have suffered very severely, ten large and four small buildings being wholly or partially destroyed.Railway tracks from the west junction to the main station have been cut in atleast 35 places, and branch lines have also been affected.Nordhausen Airfield. Photographs show that the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the20th July caused severe damage to a large hangar at the north-east corner of the airfield, and moderate damage to two barrack blocks. A group of small buildingshas been gutted. There are 50 fresh craters on the landing ground and severalmore on the hangar aprons and taxi-tracks, and two aircraft are seen to have been damaged. There is also damage to tracks, wagons and sheds in the nearbymarshalling yard.Peenemuende. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the18th July, are of small scale, but it can be seen that damage has been inflicted on the experimental station, the electrolytic hydrogen peroxide plant, the power plant area and the electrostatic hydrogen peroxide plant. On the airfield heavy damage has been caused to hangars and workshops, many of which have been destroyed. Seven aircraft on the ground have been probably damaged, and thereis a concentration of craters on the south part of the landing-ground.Schweinfurt ball-bearing factories. Photographs show that as a result oftwo U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 19th and 21st July further damage has been caused to the ball-bearing works of Kugelfischer, Fichtel and Sachs A.G. and V.K.F.(werk II).(a) Kugelfischer. Two large shops and one medium main shop have been severely damaged, the administration offices one-third destroyed andthe power plant house destroyed.

At least 35 wagons have been damaged in thesorting sidings, and the through running lines to Metz have been damaged bynear misses.Wesseling Synthetic Oil Plant. The poor quality of photographs, taken after the Bomber Command attack of the 18th/19th July, prevents detailed assessment of damage, but the Union Rheinische Braunkohlen-Kraftstoff plantis seen to have been affected throughout. Amongst buildings damaged in varying degrees are water gas plant and compressor house, the transformer, station, thesteam power station, injector houses and several other processing installations.Six large gas holders have been severely damaged or destroyed, and there isconsiderable damage to storage tanks, pipe lines and other exposed structuresand buildings.
In the Deutsche Norton abrasives plant immediately to the west, which wasalso a target, three buildings, including the stores and finishing buildings, havebeen damaged.Zinnowitz. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the18th July, though of small scale, show that considerable damage has been caused to the experimental station. The 17 small buildings comprising the target have all been affected, and many of them have been partially destroyed.Kiel. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 18th July,show many fresh hits in Deutsche Werke shipyards, where severe damage hasbeen caused to the plate sheds and iron store.

Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 23rd July, show a large concentration of fresh craters in the eastern half of the landing ground with approximately 25 on the E./W. runway. The control towerbuilding and a large administration building have been partially destroyed andthree or four aircraft on the ground have been damaged.Laon ICouvron Airfield. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the 23rd July, show large concentrations of craters have been caused from theS.W. portion of the airfield across the intersection of the runways (on which thereare at least 42 fresh craters) into the east dispersal area. Four shelters in theeast dispersal area have been slightly damaged.Juvincourt Airfield. Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 23rd July, show a large concentration of fresh craters on the E./W. and N./S.runways and on the eastern half of the landing ground. Four storage units near the north dispersal area have been damaged.Paris/ Vaires Marshalling Yard. Photographs, taken after the daylight attacks by Bomber Command on the 12th and 18th July, show fresh damage in thecentre of the area. There are approximately 160 fresh craters in the reception and sorting sidings and many wagons have been damaged or derailed. the through line Paris/Meaux has been cut at several points. The greater part of the damage resulting from previous attacks has not yet been repaired, and in many places damaged rolling stock has not been moved.saarbrucken Marshalling Yard.-Photographs, taken after the U.S.A.A.F.attacks on the 13th and 16th. July, show severe fresh damage in the yard. The1&apos;ectangular engine shed has again been heavily hit, the main station and severalnearby buildings have been damaged, and there is further severe damage to buildings, including a transhipment shed, in the goods depot. The through line to the north-east has been cut, as have tracks outside the main station.In the town there is heavy damage to an unidentified factory near the marshalling yard, and in the south-east there is severe damage to- industrial
property, including Halbergerhiitte G.m.b.H. (iron castings, &amp;c.). Saarlandisch.esStahlwerk Dingier Karcher and Co. G.m.b.H. (steel castings and railwayequipment).Toulon.

Photographs show that after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the17th July at least 32 of the storage buildings have suffered varying degrees of damage.Nucourt. This depot was attacked by Bomber Command on the night ofthe 7th/18th July. Photographs show three separate areas of subsidence, ofwhich the largest covers 15.000 square yards. There is no doubt that the attackachieved its object of causing collapse in the caverns. Damage done to approachroads and rail communications will also hinder efforts to extricate the buriedflying bombs.Rilly La Montagne. ^Photographs show that after the U.S.A.A.F. attack onthe 17th July the approaches at both ends of this railway tunnel have beenobstructed. Damage at the northern entrance should, however, not take longto repair.Railway Bridges.Photographs show : Auxerre.
