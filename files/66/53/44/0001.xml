THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1944.SECRET. Copy No. 51W.P. (44) 444.13th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.INDO-CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ONE of the questions which M. Massigli wishes to discuss with me next week is the future of French Indo-China.2. My colleagues will recall that they approved my memorandum of the16th February last (W.P. (44) 111) about Indo-China and the French Pacificpossessions, the substance of which was that the French should be allowed to retainthese territories after the war provided they accept such international obligations as may result from a system of collective security.3. At the same time, however, it was agreed that this policy should be framed in consultation with the Dominions and that we should endeavour, withtheir support, to persuade the United States to agree. But action with theDominions and the United States has so far been deferred, and it would there-fore be premature for me to elaborate the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government toM. Massigli.4. The position is complicated by the fact that, although the United StatesGovernment have given more specific guarantees than we have ourselves about therestoration of the territorial integrity of the French Empire, President Roosevelthimself is strongly opposed to the restoration of French sovereignty in Indo-China.  The French are fully aware of his attitude.5. In these circumstances, I propose to leave the initiative to M. Massigli asregards Indo-China and to confine myself as far as possible to hearing what hehas to say. Should he mention President Roosevelt and seek to draw me as to theattitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I would propose to take the line that, as itis from the Americans that the French Committee of National Liberation areexpecting difficulties, they might consider it desirable to reach an understandingdirectly with the Americans, though we should like to be kept informed about anysuch talks.6. M. Massigli may well continue to press for some indication of our attitude.In that case I would propose to say that I will certainly discuss the matter with my Cabinet colleagues, and that it will be helpful if he can let me know the viewsof the F.C.N.L. on the following questions : (a) Would France be prepared to accept, in respect of Indo-China, the sameinternational arrangements for mutual consultation and security as might be accepted by the British Empire ?(b) Would she be prepared to agree to the establishment of internationalbases at strategic points ?(c) Would she give the necessary guarantees to enable such bases to functionproperly (cf. W.P. (44) 111, paragraph 6 (b)).7. On one matter I hope to be able to satisfy M. Massigli. The F.C.N.L.have for many months past been pressing us to accept a proposal to attach amilitary mission to Admiral Mountbatten&apos;s Headquarters and to despatch aspecial corps of about 500 men to the South-East Asia theatre for the purpose of conducting subversive operations in French Indo-China. We felt obliged to12473   [27993]
withhold our acceptance until we had reached agreement with General de gaulle and the French Committee on the problems arising out of the Western offensive.Agreement on those problems has now been reached. A few days ago, therefore,the British Chiefs of Staff despatched a telegram to Washington requesting theconcurrence of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in the French proposal regardingthe military mission and the special corps. Should the reply be received in timeand be favourable I shall be able to tell M. Massigli that we accept the french proposals. On the other hand, should the reply be delayed, I propose, to saythat M. Massigli will understand that, as S.E.A.C. is an Allied command, it isnecessary for us to obtain the concurrence of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, thatwe are in communication with them on the subject, and that I will let himknow as soon as a decision is reached.8. It is to be hoped that the reply of the Combined Chiefs of Staff will not be delayed. With the progress of the operations in France the clays of the Vichyregime are numbered and, when it disappears, it is possible, though I am notprepared to say certain, that the Japanese will eject Admiral Decoux&apos;sgovernment in Indo-China and take over the administration themselves. should that happen there would be added scope for subversive operations by the specialcorps. There might also be need for some early declaration about the futureof Indo-China.A. E.Foreign Office,13th A ugust, 1944.
