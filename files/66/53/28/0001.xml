naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Human torpedoes and explosive motor boats have attacked shipping inthe eastern assault area. E-boats have been active on the convoy routes in theChannel.One U-boat has been sunk, one probably sunk and three possibly sunk.Home Waters.2. Unloading figures for the week of the 25th July-lst August were :133,173 men, 35,736 vehicles and 329,371 tons of stores, making a total of1,620,940 men, 347,302 vehicles and 1,750,554 tons of stores.3. Naval gunfire was used on several days of the week against enemy batteriesand mortars. On the 26th, the Dutch gunboat Flares -engaged batteries whichwere interfering with shipping off Langrune and, on the 30th, H.M.S. Erebusand Flores bombarded a battery, mortar positions and M.T. concentrations inthe Courseulles area from where some shelling by heavy enemy guns had takenplace.   On the 27th L.C.Gs. gave fire support in the Franceville area.4. Enemy aircraft have continued to raid the assault area by night. Onthe night of the 26th/27th, H.M. ships Faulknor, Kingsmill and H.M.C.S. Albernidestroyed two aircraft, and on the night of the 30th/31st, a coaster&apos;s balloonbrought down a torpedo bomber.5. On. the night of the 26th/27th, H.M. destroyers Obedient, Savage andOpportune with coastal forces engaged groups of E-boats in the Dover Straita number of which were damaged by gunfire. Three M.T.Bs. were slightly damaged. Norwegian M.T.Bs. were heavily engaged by shore batteries and fire from an unidentified ship off the Dutch coast. Later an enemy ship was seen tobe seriously damaged.M.T.Bs., off Cap d&apos;Antifer on the night of the 26th/27th, sank an E-boat and seriously damaged another; seven prisoners were taken. One M.T.B. wasrammed and sunk by an E-boat and another was damaged in collision with thewreckage and was later sunk by our forces. There were 25 survivors from thetwoM.T.Bs. H.M. Canadian M.T.Bs. engaged three enemy trawlers and mayhave torpedoed one of them. On the night of the 29th/30th, H.M.S. Thorn-borough (frigate) engaged a group of E-boats and damaged one of them.On the following night during an attack on a convoy from the assault area,HALS. Oribi (destroyer) damaged an E-boat and another was set on fire byM.T.Bs. M.G.Bs. engaged a group of E-boats off the Seine bank and probably damaged one of them.   Another group was shelled by H.M.S. Duff (frigate).6. Early on the 3rd, a heavy attack was made by human torpedoes andexplosive motor-boats in the eastern assault area. E-boats and low-flying aircraftcreated a diversion. HALS. Quorn (destroyer) was sunk and HALS. Blencathra(destroyer) was damaged by human torpedoes; one L.C.G. was sunk by anexplosive motor boat; two 7,000-ton ships and parts of the artificial breakwaterwere damaged by human torpedoes and an M.T.B. was damaged by E-boats. Atleast 20 explosive motor-boats and 30 human torpedoes were destroyed. OneE-boat was sunk and another damaged.   Thirty-one prisoners were taken.7. On the 29th, H.M.S. Prince Leopold (L.S.I.) was damaged by an under-water explosion and later sank.8. Reconnaissance of Granville harbour, which has recently been taken,shows extensive mining and demolition. Many barges and other craft have been sunk in the Bassin-a-Flot and elsewhere. This port normally serves the regionbetween St. Malo and Cherbourg. A lock gives access to a wet dock which willaccommodate a ship of 330 feet. The basin provides seven berths for ships of medium draught. Its quays are equipped with five electric and four steam cranes.There is also a small dry dock, 213 feet in length.North Atlantic.9. On the 2nd, U.S.S. Fiske (destroyer) was torpedoed about 500 miles north of the Azores.
Mediterranean.10. H.M. S/M. Ultor sank a 500-ton coaster oft&apos; Toulon on the 21st, and h.M. S/M. Ultimatum sank an F-lighter and probably sank another on the 27th.11. On the &quot;night of the 24th/25th, coastal forces attacked three F-lightersin the Gulf of Genoa. One lighter was sunk and the other two were beached.TJ.S. coastal forces attacked, with torpedoes, three large enemy ships in the gulf of Genoa on the night of the 25th/26th. On the following night they blew up an F-lighter off Antibes and, on the night of the 27th/28th, torpedoed a coasterin the Gulf of Genoa and damaged an F-lighter. Whilst clearing obstructions inLeghorn harbour on the 29th, a large underwater explosion occurred whichdamaged 200 feet of the mole and demolished the lighthouse in the centre.12. On the night of the 25th/26th, M.T.Bs. 651, 667 and 670 sank a largeanti-aircraft schooner, three E-boats and two I-boats off the southern DalmatianIslands.   Fifty German prisoners were taken.On the 26th, the first two Liberty ships arrived at Ancona. Three dayspreviously the harbour was shelled but no naval damage was caused.13. During a recent patrol in the iEgean, H.M. S/M, Vivid sank two caiquesby gunfire.East Indies.14. On the 13th, H.M. S/M. Stoic sank a small petrol barge off Penang, andanother small vessel in the same area on the 17th.Pacific.15. The U.S. Fleet has played an important part in the operations againstthe marinas. A force, including battleships, cruisers and carriers, has activelysupported land forces on the west coast of Guam and another similar force hasbeen operating off palestinian and Rota. A third force has been carrying out a sweepin the Western Carolines, and it is reported that this force, which beganoperations on the 24th, sank a destroyer, a gunboat, a tanker and seven smallcargo ships by carrier-borne aircraft attack.Anti-Submarine Operations.16. During July, 115 attacks were reported. Of these, 64 were by shore-based aircraft, six by carrier-borne aircraft and 45 by warships. Seven U-boats were sunk, five probably sunk and six possibly sunk.Of the 115 attacks, 21 were reported between the 26th July and the2nd August.On the 31st, ships of the 2nd Escort Group sank a U-boat S.W. of the ScillyIsles, and on the 24th H.M.S. Onslaught (destroyer) possibly sank one S.E. ofthe Isle of Wight. A Japanese U-boat was probably sunk by H.M. S/MTelemachus on the 17th in the Malacca Strait. U.S.S. Wake Island (escortcarrier) possibly sank one S.W. of the Canary Islands and aircraft possibly sankanother north of the Azores.Enemy Intelligence.17. At Bremen, which was attacked by U.S. bombers on the 29th, onetorpedo-boat was seen to have sunk, one Narvik-c\a,s,s destroyer damaged and onecargo ship set on fire. The Deschimag yards were considerably damaged andone U-boat may have been sunk. At Kiel, which was bombed on the night ofthe 23rd/24th, considerable damage was done to port facilities in the southern part of the harbour.18. The particulars of the remote-controlled explosive motor-boat used thisweek by the enemy in the Channel are believed to be as follows :-It is between 10 to 15 feet in length, constructed of wood and driven bydiesel engines with a speed of 25 to 30 knots. It can be remote-controlled byW/T or can be operated by one or two men who would make their escape ina collapsible dinghy before reaching the target. In the bow is an explosivecharge of about 660 lbs. and when the boat hits the target it sinks causing anunderwater explosion at a depth of nine to 23 feet.[27947] b
U-boats.19. In the English Channel one or two U-boats are operating betweenUshant and the Lizard and about three between Portsmouth and the Seine Bay.There has been no activity in the Atlantic or Indian Ocean where four german-boats are believed to be patrolling.Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. E-boats attacked a convoy from the assault area off Beachy Head and caused the loss of one ship and damage to four others.A ship, carrying troops to the assault area, was damaged by a mine ortorpedo but was towed into port.A U-boat unsuccessfuly attacked a convoy 40 miles S.E. of the Isle of Wight.A ship was mined and sunk in the Firth of Tay.In the Mediterranean, enemy aircraft unsuccessfully attacked a U.S. east-bound convoy off Bougie.Provisional shipping losses by enemy action during July were 74.020 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.21. During the w^eek ending the 30th, 638 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 103 were in ocean convoys and 535 in British coastal convoys. Two escort carriers, 33 destroyers (including 12 U.S. destroyers) and67 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Two homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 46 ships, and two outward-bound convoys, consisting of 57 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.22. Aircraft have laid mines off the Frisian Islands, the Biscay ports andin the Danube.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.23.   There has been no enemy minelaying in Home Waters.On most nights of the week enemy aircraft laid mines in the assault area andas many as 95 operated on the night of the 28th/29th. On one night E-boats were suspected of minelaying in the eastern area. During the week 25 groundmines in the assault area and 28 ground mines west of Cherbourg have been destroyed.On the 28th, motor launches, operating in Cherbourg harbour, began to clear the Darse Transatlantique of mines. Both there (where by the 31st,40 ground mines had been destroyed) and in the Bassin Charles X satisfactory progress is reported.24. Seventeen moored mines in the approaches to Leghorn and five moored mines off Ancona have been destroyed..The mine totals are 5,272 ground and 5.455 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.25. During the period lst-15th July, 12 enemy ships, totalling 23,799 tons were sunk, captured or became constructive total losses. Three ships totalling53.636 tons were seriously damaged.26. It is reported that a number of the smaller ships engaged in the oretrade have been requisitioned for ferrying military supplies from ports southof the Loire to the Brest Peninsula.Russian Intelligence.27. Visits in June 1944 by British Officers to Odessa, Nikolaev, Sebastopoland Novorossisk showed that all these ports except Novorossisk were closed to shipping due to the complete destruction of everything of military and navalvalue and extensive mining. At Odessa after extensive minesweeping six libertyships could be berthed but discharge would be hindered by lack of cranes andlahour. Repair facilities in the recaptured ports are very scanty and there are nostocks of bunker fuel. Nikolaev and Sebastopol, even when cleared of mines, arenot likely to be able to receive and discharge cargo ships. If it becomes possibleto send convoys to the Black Sea ports, they would probably have to dischargeat Poti or Batum. At Novorossisk a floating dock which had been sunk in the harbour has been raised and a 1,500-ton cargo ship was being repaired in it.
MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.28. In the extreme north, the Russians have taken Narva, but no further progress beyond the town has so far been reported.Dvinsk has fallen after being partially encircled, and the Russians have advanced along the whole front between Pskov and Dvinsk, where the Germansmay well have been withdrawing gradually.The Russian thrust through Lithuania has made rapid progress. Siauliai,Jelgava and Tukums were captured in quick succession, and the last land escaperoute for the German forces in Latvia and Estonia has thus been cut.Central Sector.29. Kovno has fallen, and a recent Russian push south of the town appearsto be directed on Konigsberg. In this sector the Russians are now only a few milesfrom German soil.The main weight of the Russian offensive during the week has been in thearea of Brest Litovsk and south of it. Brest Litovsk was surrounded and thencaptured, and the Russians in the meantime pushed westwards to within 12 miles of Warsaw. Their spearheads are probably even closer to the town. TheRussians are firmly established along the east bank of the Vistula from just southof Warsaw to the San confluence, and they are already trying to form bridgeheadsacross the river. The San itself has been crossed along its whole length from theconfluence to a point 25 miles west of Przemysl, which fell to the Russians on the28th.  Lwow and Stanislavov were also captured during the week.General.30. The Russians are making excellent progress. During the week theyhave advanced along practically the whole front from the Gulf of Finland to theCarpathians. There is still no sign of the Russians being seriously delayed by major administrative difficulties, and the Germans are being given no opportunityto reorganise their battered forces and stabilise the line.North-West France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.31. The successful offensive by the First U.S. Army has achieved a majorbreakthrough south and west of St. Lo. By the 2nd August a wedge of countrysome 40 miles deep had been overrun and U.S. troops had penetrated the BrittanyPeninsula as far as St. Malo and Rennes.This breakthrough underlines the success of General Montgomery&apos;s policyof seeking to draw the main weight of German armour and reserves on to theBritish front and thus ease the progress of operations of the First TJ.S. Army.In the British sector, an attack which was launched on the 30th July fromthe Caumont sector has penetrated 18 miles south to Vire. The advancecontinues.United States Sector.32. The offensive by the First U.S. Army, which opened on the 25th to thewest of St. Lo and developed on the following day into a general attack along theentire front, rapidly assumed the proportions of a major breakthrough.After infantry in heavy fighting had penetrated the enemy positions to adepth of about 2 miles, the attack was taken up by armoured columns. In the st. Lo sector, having captured Marigny and a town 3 miles to the east, a column of armour and infantry was directed on Coutances with a second mixed forcemoving on Gavray, Percy and Tessy-sur-Vire. On the west flank, two similarcolumns advanced from Lessay and Periers along the roads leading to Coutances,while infantry mopped up in their rear.Coutances was captured on the 28th and armoured forces, having by-passedGranville, occupied Avranches two days later. Meanwhile, enemy pockets in theCranville coastal sector had been mopped up and by the 2nd August the general line ran from south of Avranches along the River Selune to a point 10 milesinland, thence due north, east of Brecey and Villedieu-les-JPeeles, thence N.E.,south of Tessy-sur-Vire and Colombier.[27947] &apos;    b 2
On the 1st August, TJ.S. armoured columns entered Brittany and have sincereached St. Malo, Dinan and the important key railway centre of Rennes some30 miles further south.British Sector.33. While the First TJ.S. Army launched its offensive west of St. Lo, theSecond British Army continued to maintain its threat east of the River Orne andthus contain the bulk of the enemy&apos;s armoured formations. Strong enemycounter-attacks south of Caen were met and beaten back during the early partof the week when support given by the Royal Air Force was particularly valuable.On the 30th. a new attack directed on Le Beny Bocage was launched south ofCaumont. This was designed to take advantage of the crumbling German front in the TJ.S. sector. After a powerful attack by heavy and medium bombers,infantry, supported by armour, pierced the enemy defences on a 2-mile frontwhich has since been extended westwards to link up with the First U.S. Army,and eastwards to Cahagnes and Coulvain. The advance south through very steepand wooded country against determined opposition resulted in the capture of st. Martin des Besaces and Le Beny Bocage by the 1st August and of Vire thefollowing day.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)34. There have been no outstanding successes during the week. eighth army troops have maintained close contact with the enemy, and in places havepushed him back. Fifth Army has consolidated its positions along theRiver Arno; patrol work has been continuous and there have been some heavyexchanges of mortar and artillery fire.On the Adriatic sector, Polish forces have established a small bridgeheadover the River Misa in the area round Senegal!ia which fell on the 28th July.Further to the south-west, Polish and Italian troops have pushed forward towards.the line of the River Misa.Indian troops have made progress either side of the River Tiber, and enteredSansepolcro on the 2nd August.On the left flank of Eighth Army, British and Dominion forces, the latterconsisting of New Zeaianders, South Africans and Indians, have advancedagainst strong opposition. The enemy is fighting hard in order to deny to new Zealand forces high ground which overlooks Florence from the south-west.Further to the west, Indian troops pushed well forward to capture Empoli onthe 29th.Yugoslavia.35. Reports indicate that Marshal Tito&apos;s forces are on the offensive almostthroughout the country.In Serbia, the Partisans have been hard pressed by enemy forces in the mountains south of Nis but have not suffered any substantial loss.In Montenegro, the Partisan counter-attack&apos; east of Andrijevica (reported last week) has met with considerable success and the town itself was captured withAllied air support on the 25th. The guerrillas have now pushed to the south and east in pursuit of the enemy, and have taken Plav (18 miles S.E. of Andrijevica).In Western Bosnia, a week&apos;s hard fighting has resulted in the recapture ofGlamoc airfield by the Partisans, while in Dalmatia the latter have seized severalvillages and repelled a German attack on Vrlika (on the Knin-Sinj road).Greece.36.   Sabotage attacks have continued.Burma.37. On the Imphal-Tiddim road our troops have made a further shortadvance and have now reached the area immediately south of Churachandpur.One medium tank, four light tanks, two infantry guns and some motor transportwere found abandoned when our troops reached this area.Pacific Theatre.palestinian Island.38.   Japanese resistance on palestinian has ceased.
Guam Island.39. U.S. troops completed the capture of the Orote Peninsula on tire 29th.They have also extended their bridgehead in breadth.Neiv Guinea.40. TJ.S. forces made another landing, supported by U.S. and H.M.Australian ships, on the northern coast of Dutch New Guinea on the 29th. the landing, which was practically unopposed, was on Vogelkop Peninsula in the areaof Cape Sasnsapor, about 60 miles N.E. of Sorong and nearly 200 miles west ofNoemfoor. U.S. troops also secured the . small islands of Amsterdam andMiddleburg, which lie close offshore.AIR SITUATION.General Review.41. In France, Allied aircraft gave close support to the advances of ourarmies, having previously delivered a series of &quot; softening &quot; blows at Germanconcentrations. Much enemy transport and armour was destroyed and railway communications were cut at numerous points. Strong formations of heavy bombers attacked strategic targets in the Reich; these included oil plants atMerseburg and Bremen and industrial objectives at Stuttgart, Munich, Hamburgand Ludwigshafen.M.A.A.F. heavy bombers attacked targets in the South of France, AustriaHungary and the Balkans.There was a small increase in the number of flying-bombs launched against this country.United Kingdom.42. Flying-bomb attacks are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and home security.&quot;  No other important enemy air activity has been reported.Home Waters.43. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 664 sorties involving 6,075 flyinghours.  Bomber Command aircraft laid 32 sea-mines.Off St. Malo. Avengers sank two landing-craft, one of which was laden withtroops. East of Belle He, Mosquitoes probably sank a 500-ton coastal auxiliaryand seriously damaged a 400-ton trawler. A number of other operations wTascarried out against shipping but, owing to poor visibility, results were impossibleto assess.Western Front.44. A total of 29,940 sorties was &quot;flown and 25,708 tons of bombs were dropped. Allied losses were 239 aircraft, of which 125 were heavy bombers,16 medium and light bombers and 98 fighters and fighter-bombers. enemy casualties in combat were 144 destroyed, 22 probably destroyed and 49 damaged.France.45,-(a) Offensive activity in support of Allied armies. Nearly 8,000effective sorties were flown in attacks on tactical targets having a direct bearing on land operations, and in close support-of our troops.On the 30th, a total of 2,000 tons was dropped on enemy troop concentrationsin the Caumont/Villers Bocage area, by heavy and medium bombers. During theweek, medium, light and (on two nights) heavy bombers released a further.260 tons on other selected aiming-points in the same area, in the St. Lo sector and on the approaches to Avranches. Fighters detailed to eliminate Scrignac,a strong-point near Morlaix, practically demolished this village.Cannon and machine-gun attacks we&apos;re made on a large number of transporta-tion targets. Fighters on armed reconnaissances searched for and attackedvehicles and troops on the road and in billets. Other aircraft raided concentra-tions of armour in order to disrupt threatened counter-attacks. Duringoperations of this nature, several of which were carried out just ahead of theAllied lines and others over wide areas of the front, the following are claimed
to have been destroyed 260 tanks, 100 heavy vehicles and fuel tanks, 1,700 othermechanised transport, 100 horses, 40 mortar and gun positions, 80 locomotives and 470 railroad cars, trucks and fuel tankers; many others were severely damaged.Our aircraft, operating mainly west and south-west of Paris, delayed themovement of supplies and reinforcements by attacks on railway centres and bridges, while, south of the battle area, a very large number of railway trackswas cut at vital points, many of them in several places. A total of 3,060 tonsof bombs was dropped during these missions.(b) Ammunition and fuel dumps. Approximately 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped on depots, principally south and &quot;west of the battle front.(c) Airfields. 1,520 tons of bombs were released on these objectives, mostof them situated within 60 miles south and south-west of Paris. (VideAppendix VII, paragraphs 1, 2 and 7.)(d) Havre Port. Heavy bombers dropped 300 tons on each of two days, the objectives including naval vessels in harbour and a U-boat in dry dock. (VideAppendix VII, paragraph 5.)(e) Flying-bomb&quot; installations. Operations against long-range weaponinstallations were carried out by heavy bombers each day and on two nights;1,600 tons were dropped on launching sites and 3,260 tons on supply depots.(f) Supply dropping. Supplies to patriots were successfully released by193 Fortresses.Germany.46. By day, escorted heavy bombers dropped a total of 2,690 tons onsynthetic oil plants at Merseburg and 1,115 tons on a similar objective at Bremen.(Vide Appendix VII, paragraphs 9 and 11.) A total of 1,515 tons of bombs wasreleased on industrial targets at Munich, the adjacent airfield at Schleissheim andaero-engine works at Allach, north-west of the city. In an attack on Ludwigs-hafen, 1,100 tons were dropped. The Taucha aero-engine works at Leipzig and railway facilities at Wiesbaden were bombed on a smaller scale.At night, totals of 1.615 and 1.180 tons of bombs were dropped by heavy bombers at Stuttgart and Hamburg respectively. Mosquitoes carried^ outharassing raids on Stuttgart (36 tons) and Frankfurt (54 tons in two raids).Mediterranean Front.47. During the week ended dawn on the 1st, Allied aircraft of the M.A.A.F.flew a total of 11,811 sorties, of which 2,652 were heavy bombers (73 missing)and dropped 7,595 tons of bombs; 128 Allied aircraft are missing and 244 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Although adverse weather somewhat restricted operations the StrategicAir Force bombed oil installations at Bucharest, Ploesti, Berat and in theBudapest area. Railway centres were attacked at Brod and in Greece; works and airfields were bombed in the Vienna district and in Hungary. In the Southof France oil and other targets were attacked.The Tactical Air Force maintained attacks on enemy communications, stores and transport, and continued to provide close support for Allied land forces.Italy.48. In Northern Italy, successful attacks were made on railway bridges.Many bridges were destroyed or rendered unserviceable, the principal attacksbeing made in the areas of Turin, Milan and Spezia and on the Rimini/Bologna/Ferrara lines. Other effective attacks by the Tactical Air Force were carriedout against railway centres, rail tracks and roads, these latter being cut innumerous places. During one operation by fighter-bombers, 46 railway cars andthree locomotives were either destroyed or damaged. Eighty-six M.T. vehicles were destroyed and 41 damaged.Fighter-bombers attacked enemy positions, guns, dumps and several airfieldswhere 34 aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Fighters provided patrols andescorts and many reconnaissances were flown. In operations over Italy medium,light and fighter-bombers flew a total of 3,354 sorties.Off the coast three schooners were destroyed and several small merchant ships sunk. Light bombers made attacks on shipping in the Po estuary and onbarges at Ravenna. The harbour installations at Genoa were bombed by 179escorted Liberators; similar targets at Spezia and a number of small harbourswere attacked by lighter aircraft.
Southern France.49. U.S. heavies of the M.A.A.F. bombed the torpedo factory (72 tons) andthe railway centre (216 tons) at Port Les Valence. A further 24 Fortressesattacked an oil storage depot in this area. The north and south railway bridgesat Avignon were bombed by 57 Liberators and an oil storage depot in the vicinityby a further 22. Three heavies are missing from these operations. Duringattacks on airfields, Thunderbolts destroyed 15 enemy aircraft on the ground and damaged a further 19.Yugoslavia and Albania.50. TJ.S. heavies dropped 56 tons on the oil refinery at Berat and 232 tonson the rail centre at Brod. where 120 wagons were either destroyed or damaged.The Balkan Air Force continued attacks on roads, railways, M.T. andlocomotives, four of these latter being destroyed and a further 98 damaged; alarge fire was started among 12 railway tankers. Buildings, i hutted camps,workshops and enemy personnel were bombed and machine-gunned.Austria and Hungary.51. On the 26th, in the Vienna district and in Hungary, 324 U.S. heaviesdropped nearly 700 tons of bombs on airfields and an aircraft factory; photo-graphs taken subsequently show very extensive damage. During these operations56 enemy fighters were destroyed and 14 heavies and four escorting fighters were lost.On the 27th, U.S. heavies attacked the Manfred Weiss Armament works at Budapest (828 tons), and the railway centre at Pecs (66 tons). Very severeand extensive damage was done to the armament works; 14 enemy fighters were shot down and nine heavies are missing.On the 30th, in the Budapest area, TJ.S. heavies dropped over 600 tons onan airfield, an aircraft factory and an oil refinery; results are reported to be good. Five enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of four bombers and twoescorting fighters.Rumania and Greece.52. U.S. heavies, supported by Wellingtons in night attacks, dropped atotal of about 1,400 tons on oil installations at Ploesti, and over 400 tons on similar targets in the Bucharest area; very good results are reported. Forty-two enemy aircraft were destroyed and 25 bombers and eight escorting fighters were lost. Ninety-eight fighters, based on Russia, carried out an offensive sweep overthe Ploesti/Bucharest area, and 26 enemy aircraft were destroyed in the air and on the ground; all but two fighters landed safely in Italy.The rail centre at Phlorina in Greece was bombed by 24 Liberators. On one night, 18 Liberators and 34 Wellingtons successfully laid mines in the RiverDanube.Russia.53. The Russian long-range bomber force has been active on the WhiteRussian and Baltic Army Group fronts. On the Finnish front, Russian airformations were particularly active on the 29th and 31st, and on the Baltic fronton the 26th and 28th Russian attacks in the area of the Vistula were supportedby strong air formations.It is considered that about half (950 aircraft) the German Air Force on theRussian front is engaged between the Warsaw area and the Baltic Sea. The air defence of East Prussia has recently been strengthened. In addition to attacks on railways, German bombers have operated at night against troop concentrationsin the Lublin area.Burma.54. Allied aircraft, for the week ended the 1st August, flew a total of1,448 sorties, of which 768 were by bombers and fighter-bombers. Transport air-craft flew 1,580 sorties, carrying 3,576 tons, 3,884 men, and evacuated 1,968 menand 2,887 casualties.
The principal Allied activity was in the Assam/Chin Hills/Chindwin area,where attacks were made on enemy camps, villages, roads, river-craft, dumps andM.T. In the vicinity of Mandalay, Liberators and Wellingtons bombed the rail-ways. In Central Burma, Beaufighters continued effectively to attack locomotives and rolling-stock. River-craft, bashas and an enemy headquarters were attacked in the areas of Mayu and Buthidauns:.China Zone.55. Allied aircraft, for the week ended the 1st August, flew a total of 667sorties; five Allied aircraft are missing and 21 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat.   Transport aircraft flew 192 sorties.During the week many successful attacks were carried out against enemytransport. Eighty river-craft, 129 junks, 17 barges, 20 units of rolling-stock and45 M.T. vehicles were either destroyed or damaged; in addition eight small ships were sunk and 360 casualties caused to enemy personnel. During an attack onwarehouses and railway yards in the Yellow River battle area, ten of 15 inter-intercepting enemy fighters were destroyed. Two good attacks were made on Yochow(80 miles N.N.E. of Changsha), escorting fighters destroying eight enemy aircraft.Fighter-bombers attacked several airfields, including that at Pailuchi(90 miles S.W. of Hankow), where 18 enemy aircraft were destroyed while takingoff or refuelling. Warehouses and storage areas at Samah Bay (Hainan Island)were bombed by 26 Liberators and the railway yards at Wuchang (38 miles S.E.of Hankow) by a further 12.Several Allied airfields were bombed by enemy aircraft, and although only afew aircraft were damaged, considerable quantities of petrol were destroyed.The steel works at Ansham (40 miles S. of Mukden. Manchuria) was bombed by 56 Super Fortresses. A further eight of these bombers attacked Chenghsien(Honan) and 14 Tangku (Tientsin); results are reported to be good; several othersbombed targets of opportunity.

ENEMY ACTIVITY AND HOME SECURITY.General.59. During the week 833 F.Bs. were launched (compared with 759 for theprevious week and 513 the week before that). This week 326 F.Bs. were destroyed,of which 44 were shot down over the sea.The spasmodic style of attack which is carried out by a succession of salvosappears to be increasing, and there have been a number of instances when a dozenor more F.Bs. have been in operation more or less simultaneously.There have again been several appreciable breaks and despite the increasedscale of effort enemy operations have occupied under 30 per cent, of the period.London remains the primary target and house property continues to suffer themost damage; some F.Bs. are being filled with Trialene which is estimated toextend the radius of blast by 15 to 20 per cent. A comparison between a mapindicating the density of attack and another indicating the density of populationshows that the heaviest damage has not occurred in the most densely populatedboroughs. During the week the boroughs mainly affected are Croydon with20 incidents, Lewisham (19), Wandsworth (13), Beckenham (12), Chislehurst andSidcup (11), Stepney (11), Woolwich (10) and Greenwich, Hackney andCamberwell with 8 each.Outside London there were 131 incidents in Kent, 83 in Sussex, 44 in Essexand 20 in Surrey.60. The number of key points affected is provisionally estimated at 55; inten cases, six of which were factories, the effects were material.. Eighteen railway incidents have been reported during the week, of which13 caused interruption in services; these have all been cleared with the exception ofthe Forest Hill/Honor Oak line and the lines from Tulse Hill to West Norwoodand Streatham.On the night of the 28th/29th a 45-pump fire was caused at City Road,Finsbury, where Moorfields Eye Hospital was involved, and on the night of thelst/2nd August there Was a 40-pump fire in Silvertown; these were the largestfires that have yet been caused by F.Bs.
