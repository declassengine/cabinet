THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1944.SECRET. Copy. No.     6 0W.P. (44) 403.23rd July, 1944.WAR CABINET.CONSULTATION WITH THE EUROPEAN ALLIED GOVERNMENTSABOUT TERMS OF SURRENDER FOR GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE terms of reference of the European Advisory Commission state that&apos;&apos; Representatives of the Governments of other United Nations will, at the discretion of the Commission, be invited to take part in meetings of theCommission when matters especially affecting their interests are underdiscussion.&quot;2. Since the Commission first began its work on the terms of surrender for germany, the United Kingdom Representative has pressed for a measure of consultation with, the European Allied Governments, on the general ground that,as Germany&apos;s neighbours and being numbered among her victims, the countries concerned have a special interest in the question of the surrender terms for germany as a whole. In this the United Kingdom Representative has receivedsupport from the United States Representative. The Soviet Representative has,however, until recently resisted the proposal to consult the European AlliedGovernments, on the plea that their interests will be adequately met if the three powers can secure, the capitulation of Germany; and if they are to be consultedat all they should only be consulted on points of special interest to them and noton the terms of surrender as a whole. This attitude on the part of the soviet representative is in keeping with the line he has now adopted as regards the participation of the European Allied Governments in the occupation of Germany,namely, that, since their share in the war effort is small, their contribution to theforces of occupation should also be kept small.3. More recently, however, the Soviet Representative has been persuaded toagree that, as a first step, a communication should be addressed by the Commissionto the European Allied Governments, including the French Committee ofNational Liberation, in the terms of the annexed draft. In this communicationthe Commission would merely ask the Governments concerned to send in theirviews in wanting, and would not communicate the Commission^ own proposals to them. The Soviet Representative has, however, also agreed that when theCommission has received replies to this communication it will consider furtherpractical steps lying within its competence for consultation with the Governmentsconcerned as well as with Governments of other United Nations.4. The Soviet Representative made one condition in giving his assent to thiscourse, namely, that the letter to the European Allied Governments should notbe despatched until the Commission had forwarded to the three Governments notonly the draft Instrument of Surrender for Germany, which has been ready forsome weeks, but also the two proposed draft Protocols about the occupation ofGermany, and of Austria. The discussion on these two draft Protocols has beenlengthy and is still dragging on. Meanwhile, I am being increasingly pressed by the European Allied Governments for an assurance that they will be adequatelyconsulted about the terms of surrender for Germany. The United kingdom representative has, on my instructions, informed his colleagues that, unless anearly decision can be taken by the Commission to send off &quot;the proposed letter,His Majesty&apos;s Government may have no alternative but to enter into consulta-tion with the European Allied Governments themselves.12436   [27868]
5. At a recent meeting of the Commission the United Kingdom Repre-sentative proposed that the Commission should now submit the draft instrument of Surrender to the three Governments and despatch the letter to the AlliedGovernments, leaving the two draft occupation Protocols to be forwarded later.The Soviet Representative was, however, unable to accept this proposal.6. I am therefore inclined to think that I ought now to enter into eonsulta-tion with the European Allied Governments and the French Committee ofNational Liberation on the subject of the terms of surrender for Germany.I would not as a first step go beyond the general lines proposed in the draft letterfrom the Commission, though as time went on the scope of the consultationswould no doubt broaden. I should also propose to instruct the United kingdom representative to inform his colleagues that, without prejudice to any step which the Commission may itself take, I am approaching the European AlliedGovernments and the French Committee of National Liberation on the lines indicated above.A. E.Foreign Office, 23rd July, 1944.Draft Letter from the Chairman of the European Advisory Commission tothe Ministers for Foreign Affairs - of Belgium, Czechoslovakia,Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Yugoslavia and to the ambassadors in London of Greece and the French Committee ofNational Liberation.Under instructions received from the Governments of the United States ofAmerica, the United Kingdom and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, theEuropean- Advisory Commission has been entrusted with the task of making recommendations to the three Governments on the terms of surrender to be imposedupon Germany and the machinery required to ensure the fulfilment of those terms.The Commission has reached a point in its studies at which it would welcome an expression of the views of the European Allied Governments on any of thesematters which those Governments would wish to convey to the Commission.I   am   therefore   desired   by   the   Commission   to   say   that   if  the-r r\--r7T-e att&apos;--r 0^rm*l.el1   should wish to lay before theFrench Committee of national Liberation JCommission any statement of their views on any of the problems referred to aboveor any exposition of their special interests in any of these matters, the commission would be glad to receive such statements in writing so that it could take them into account in its further deliberations.I would emphasise that since the work of the Commission in its present phasehas important military aspects, the proceedings of the Commission are secret, andthat it is essential that there should be no public disclosure either of the content of the communications which may be addressed to the Commission by theGovernments concerned, or even of the fact that such communications have beenmade at all.   The Commission therefore counts on the Governments concerned to take the necessary security precautions to this end.
