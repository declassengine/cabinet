THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA,TESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   july 1944.SECRET, Copy No.W.P. (44) 405.23rd July, 1944.WAR CABINET.REARMAMENT OF SYRIAN GENDARMERIE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A situation of considerable embarrassment to our relations with the french national Committee has been created over the question of the arming andequipping of the gendarmerie in the two Levant States, a task which under theagreements between us rightly falls to the French, but which they have not hitherto performed to the satisfaction of our military authorities.2. At the beginning of June the Syrian Government, feeling quite rightlythat the gendarmerie had failed to perform their duties in connexion with certainpost-election disturbances, addressed a request to the French for 1,000 riflesas a matter of urgency. The French offered them a much smaller number ofantiquated weapons. The Syrians then came to us, and our military authorities,with the support of our Minister in Beirut, seem to have been engaged in planning the distribution of arms on a scale for which they have hitherto produced noconvincing justification. The original Syrian request for 1,000 rifles has nowbeen converted into a total, for the two States, of 5,000 modern Italian riflesplus 2,000 spares, together with 120 Bren guns and other automatic weapons.3. The French are up in arms about this decision and their indignationis no whit diminished by the assurances which we continue to receive fromGenerals Paget and Holmes to the effect that the former&apos;s decisions have beenaccepted by the French local military authorities. The French indignation is largely to be explained by the circumstance that they have in actual fact greatly reduced their forces in the Levant in recent months and have now no more thanthe equivalent of three battalions, two of which are Senegalese. So far thereforefrom there being any question of the French planning a coup against the LevantStates, in the present circumstances the danger in Algiers at least is felt to be entirely the reverse that the States, with the full assistance of our militaryand other authorities, may take advantage of French military weakness andpreoccupation in other theatres to overthrow the weak French garrisons whichare all that remain.4. In these circumstances I feel obliged to ask that instructions may beissued forthwith to the Commander-in-Chief in Cairo that his decision to issue the amount of equipment referred to above must be disallowed on political grounds and that he should now propose to the French, through whatever channelhe may think best, that the issue of rifles should be restricted for the present tothe figure of 2,000 between the two States with a corresponding reduction inthe number of automatic weapons.5. I cannot conceal from my colleagues- that our authorities in the middle east, both military and civil, require to be reminded that at this stage of thewar, when the Levant is no longer in any way directly concerned with hostilities,it becomes necessary to make increasing allowance for political considerations,which, insignificant as they may seem to those on the spot, are nevertheless by no means without importance in the handling of larger issues in London and elsewhere.A.
