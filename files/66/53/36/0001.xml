THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1944.SECRET.Copy No. 2 2W.P. (44) 436.Qth August, 1944.fWAR CABINET.SOVIET POLICY IN EUROPE.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 7th June I circulated to the Cabinet a paper, W.P. (44) 304, onSoviet Policy in the Balkans. It has occurred to me that my colleagues wouldlike a similar review of the part we may expect Russia to play in the remainingareas of Europe, the extent to which our interests and influence will be affected and the policy which we should therefore follow.2. The annexes to this paper cover respectively : I, Germany; II, France;III, Central Europe (Poland, Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia); IV, Italy;V, the Low Countries and Switzerland; VI, Scandinavia; and VII, the iberian peninsula. .3. In attempting to estimate Soviet policy in the post-war period, there are clearly two broad possibilities : The first is that the Soviet Government will trya policy of collaboration with ourselves and the United States (and China),whether within the framework of a World Organisation or without it, if it fails to materialise. This, having regard to their immense task of rehabilitation and reconstruction and their ardent desire to resume as rapidly as possible theirinterrupted programme of internal development, I consider much the more likely,provided that the Kremlin is convinced of our intention to keep Germany weak and does not become suspicious that this country and the United States are seeking to build up a combination of European States against her around arevived Germany. Even if this proviso is met, Soviet collaborative spirit wouldbe by no means perfect, but their aim of working with us to keep Germany downand their desire not to combine Europe with Germany against Russia would almost certainly suffice to restrain them both from using the methods ofundisguised power politics in their dealings with other countries and from trying to exercise an undue influence on their internal affairs. Alternatively, the SovietGovernment may decide that it will pay them best to break all the rules, to take full advantage of post-war disorder in Europe, to come out in open antagonism ofeverything which Russian propaganda has associated with &apos;&apos; capitalism &apos;&apos; and&quot; imperialism &quot; and to use all their immense power and influence in support of extreme Left-wing movements in the countries of Europe, including evenGermany. This, as I have indicated, I regard as far less likely provided that russia does not conclude that solely by so doing can she prevent the building upof a combination in Europe against her, the spearhead of which could only bea revived Germany. During the period when she is principally concerned withinternal rehabilitation and development (which one might put at a minimum offive years and probably at much longer), Russia will, I believe, try the formerpolicy. The annexes to this paper are based on that assumption. They thereforeassume that Russia will refrain, at least during that period, from territorialaggression and from attempts to enhance her own influence in foreign countries by methods and to an extent that would seriously indispose opinion in thiscountry or the United States. This would not, however, prevent her fromsupporting, within these limits, movements and parties in foreign countries thatlook to Moscow for inspiration and, in general, taking the side of the &quot; prole-tariat &quot; against the &quot; Capitalist.&quot;12463   [27978&apos;]b
4. I should add one thing more on this point. It may well be that there arestill two schools of thought in the Soviet Union : one collaborationist, the otherholding that the Soviet Union can and should trust nobody and must rely upon her own might and such use as she can make of her friends in foreign countries.Fortunately, from all evidence and appearances, it seems that Stalin is theprotagonist of the first school and that it is in the ascendant. It should be ourconstant aim to strengthen the hands of the collaborationists by paying regardto the Soviet Governments reasonable demands and views, by informing andconsulting them freely and frankly. Equally, we shall, I believe, only earn theirrespect and achieve a real measure of collaboration by being as outspoken about our own requirements, views and interests as they frequently are with us abouttheirs. We should always remember the complete success of the frank approachmade by the Prime Minister in his broadcast of the 22nd June, 1941, when, inoffering collaboration, he made it clear that we would have nothing- to do withCommunism in this country.5. As regards the estimate of our own interests which lie in the background of the annexes to this paper. I take our strategic interests in Europe whichmight be affected by the spread of Soviet power and influence to be -(a) the security of the United Kingdom against long-distance air attack and,still more, against the domination of Europe by a single Great Power;(b) the security of our vital sea and air communications, in the mediterranean and elsewhere.From the political and commercial standpoints, we require the speediestpossible restoration of order and security in Europe, and that as many as possible of the Governments and peoples of Europe should seek our friendship and guidance and should give us their confidence. Our financial power has largelygone; we must seek to compensate for that loss by winning the admiration ofEuropean, peoples for our way of life and for our achievements in the social,economic; industrial, scientific and intellectual fields. We must maintain our influence by gaining the sympathy of the new Governments and generations thatwill come to power after the war. In the nineteenth century the power of thiscountry in Europe was immensely enhanced by the fact that she stood for progressin the political as well as in the industrial fields and was prepared to use herinfluence in support of popular -democratic forces in their struggle againstautocracy. In the post-war period our influence in European countries will muchdepend upon whether, in attempting to restore order out of chaos and therecan be little doubt that it will in varying degrees be a new order, not a return tothe old -these countries adopt (as there may well be a temptation to do in the pursuit of quick, drastic and &apos;&apos; progressive &apos;&apos; solutions) methods and regimessuch as would be likely to seek inspiration in Moscow, or whether they will modelthemselves on the methods of the Western democracies, and especially GreatBritain, because they judge from what they see here that these methods cancommand success in tackling the appalling social and economic problems of thepost-war Europe. The annexes to this paper, therefore, seek to foretell what typeof regime is likely to emerge in the various countries dealt with. It will be seenthat the forecasts are on the whole favourable, and that if the Soviet Government,during the immediate post-war period when unrest&apos; will be greatest in Europe,wish to avoid directly indisposing the Anglo-Saxon democracies by undueinterference in European countries, the conditions in Europe generally will be such that we ought, if we play our cards well, to be able to maintain our &quot;influence and position in most, if not all, European countries.6.   While I am convinced that the foundation of our post-war Europeanpolicy must be the Anglo-Soviet Alliance, aimed at preventing any recurrence ofGerman aggression, I see no reason why within this framework we should not     )work to consolidate our position in three groups of European countries with which our relations have been traditionally close and intimate (p) the Western Countries:   France,  the Low  Countries,  the  iberian peninsula, especially Portugal;(&amp;) the Scandinavian Countries; and(c) the Mediterranean Group, comprising Turkey, Greece and eventuallyItaly.7. At the same time, while avoiding any direct challenge to Russianinterests in Central European countries adjacent to the Soviet Union, we shouldavail ourselves of every opportunity to spread British influence in these countries,
profiting for this purpose from the new relationship we have established duringthis war with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, and from the moralauthority and esteem which we may reasonably expect to enjoy in Hungary,Roumania and Austria when these countries have been liberated from theGerman yoke.A. E..Foreign Office, Qth August, 1944.ANNEX I.Germany.BOTH logic and all the available evidence suggest that Russia&apos;s attitude toGermany in the post-war period will be governed by the determination that sheshall be rendered permanently innocuous, and secondarily that Germany shall be forced to contribute to the maximum possible degree both in labour and goods tothe reparation of the damage she has caused in Russia.2. The Soviet Government is unlikely to forget that in spite of ten years&apos;preparation for a - defensive war they were unable to prevent Germany, withalmost 100 million fewer inhabitants than Russia, from overrunning in four months a vast area of Soviet territory and from almost capturing Moscow, whichmight have meant defeat. They will long remember that again in 1942 russia was only saved by the vastness of her expanses and of her sacrifices of man-powerand material. Both the Soviet Government and the Soviet people must dread thepossibility of German recovery and they deal in drastic remedies. It is natural,therefore, that Stalin should be an advocate of the dismemberment of Germany.He requires a settlement which will &quot; completely exclude the possibility of freshaggression on the part of Germany &quot; (Stalin, the 6th November, 1943). TheSoviet Government have long since in their internal propaganda dropped the distinction which they made at the beginning of the war between good and NaziGermans. They have devoted every device of publicity to arousing a passionatehatred of the Germans, which reinforced by appalling German atrocities and destruction has borne full fruit, except perhaps in certain non-Russian areaslately in German occupation, such as the westerly parts of the Ukraine, whereconciliatory tactics seem to have had some success. The Soviet Government arelikely, therefore, to set the greatest store by the co-operation of their Allies in themost stringent and effective measures for preventing a revival of Germany as a menace to Russia. Equally, they will be intensely suspicious if we and theUnited States Government appear tender-hearted towards Germany, or if weargue that a prosperous Germany is necessary if Europe as a whole, and GreatBritain in particular, is to be prosperous. M. Maisky recently told a Britishofficial that he foresaw in this one of the greatest obstacles to the establishment of relations of real confidence.3. It is sometimes suggested that the Soviet Government&apos;s method ofdealing with Germany will be on the contrary to work for a Communist Germany,and then combine with her against the other great powers.4. In the late niheteen-twenties and early thirties there was a substantial body of Communists in Germany (in the last election before Hitler came to power November 1932 nearly 6 million voters). When the Nazis came into power, aconsiderable percentage of the Communist rank and file was absorbed into the nazi organisations, but the leaders were nearly all killed or went into exile. TheCommunist Party organisations were, of course, broken up. Thereafter therewas little chance even of - underground Communist activity. As a result ofRussian military successes there has, however, developed, especially more recently,a certain interest in Communism. There has even been reported a tendency incertain quarters in the Wehrmacht and party to argue that, if Germany w-as goingto lose the war, her best hope of survival would be to go Communist and throw in her lot with the U.S.S.R. There is, however, no evidence at present of any significant Communist organisation.5.   It is extremely difficult to forecast how quickly the Communists would beable to restore their organisations to a sufficient extent to be able to play a politicalrole in Germany immediately after the collapse. Nor is it easy to say what groupswithin the Reich might make common cause with them. These might well include,[27978] &apos;    b 2
in addition to former Communists, the extreme wing of the former social democrats and the extreme Nazis, including some of the armed S.S. ,* In addition,there mav well be a very large number of Germans who. having lest everything inthe bombing, see in Communism their best hope for the future. It is impossibleto estimate what the political aims of such a movement would be. They might attempt to set up local Soviets and to seek support and encouragement from theU.S.S.R., though whether they would actually be willing to take instructions from moscow is another matter. All that can be said with certainty is that, whileCommunism in Germany is not at present a factor to be reckoned with, it mightconstitute an element which would increase confusion at the time of the collapse.Its subsequent development would probably depend largely on the attitude of theU.S.S.R. There seem to be very strong arguments against the proposition that theSoviet Government will work for a combination with a Communist Germany.This would be to work for a revival of Germany trusting in Russia&apos;s ability to dominate her. But it is precisely Germany and Japan that can be a directmenace to the security of the Soviet Union, whereas the other Powers neither cannor wish to be so. Nor are the Soviet Government so ill-informed about germany as not to know that a Communist Germany would almost certainly remainnationalistic and soon begin to dream of revenge and domination. They musthave a healthy fear of German powers of organisation, and of the Germancapacity for unified effort under a strong regime. Moreover, as the Soviet Unionmoves further from true Communism a Communist Germany might well become a danger to Russians position as leader of the extreme Left in the world. if germany were to go Communist spontaneously Russian ideologists might wish tobefriend the new proselyte. But Stalin is a realist not an ideologist. Before and during the war the emphasis in Russia has entirely and necessarily been onefficiency, discipline and achievement, not on political theories.6. It seems safe then to assume that Russia will only seek a combination with Germany if she believes that the other world Powers design to restoreGermany as a bulwark against herself. Especially is this assumption safe duringthe first five years or more after the war, while Russia must herself repair the damage she has suffered and.further exploit her own internal resources in orderto render herself invulnerable against all comers.7. Germany^ on her side will, of course, be on the look-out for any weakeningin the policy of Anglo-Soviet co-operation and will be quick to offer herself as occasion requires to either party/. To the Soviet Government she can presentherself as the Communist or Socialist partner ready- to help to keep the capitalistWestern Powers from meddling in &quot;Central and Eastern Europe&quot; and canexpress readiness to acquiesce in any territorial aggrandisement which mightappeal to the Russians. To the Western Powers she will pose as the champion ofEuropean culture ready to join in resisting Russian and Communist penetration of Europe from the East.8. The remedy- is the continuance of the closest possible degree of co-opera-tion with the Soviet Government, especially in all that concerns Germany, and the avoidance so far as possible of all signs of friendship for Germany or weaknesstowards her. No doubt we in this country, and more still the Americans, will find it difficult to agree with all Russian draconian ideas about the post-wartreatment of Germany. AVhen such cases arise we must do our best to meet theRussians half-way and should be at pains to explain convincingly to them thereasons for our disagreement.9. We must also be careful in all our dealings with other european countries, and especially the countries of Eastern Europe, to give the SovietGovernment no cause to think we are building up a bloc against her. For theSoviet Government would rightly consider that such a bloc would inevitablysooner or later require German co-operation.ANNEX II.France.BOTH before and after the last World War France and Russia were drawntogether through a common fear of Germany, notwithstanding the wideideological gulf between the Third Republic and both the Czarist and Bolshevikregimes.  This tendency is likely to be even more marked after the present war.
2. However drastic the measures taken by the United Nations to prevent are currence of German aggression, France must inevitably feel that her best safe-guard lies in the existence of a powerful and friendly Russia able and willing to contain Germany from the East. Moreover, the ideological differences willprobably be less (French post-war opinion will probably gravitate to the Left),while the experiences of the war will have produced a respectful admiration for russian achievements such as never existed before. General de Gaulle has madethe cultivation of Russia a feature of his foreign policy. He has been accused of doing this with the object of loosening France&apos;s ties with the Anglo-SaxonPowers and of winning Russian support to counter their influence during theyears of reconstruction. He has doubtless thought it convenient on occasion touse his Russian connexion as a means of pressure on London and Washington,although it should be noted that the Soviet Government have refrained from giving him any encouragement. It is reasonable to assume that the underlyingmotive of his pro-Russian policy is his realisation of the importance of a strong and friendly Russia as a factor in maintaining French security.3. Although France, as the weaker Power, has most to gain from a Franco-Russian rapprochement, it is also in Russia&apos;s interest to enhance the authority and influence the development of the future French Government as a reinsuranceagainst potential German aggression. For this purpose it is not enough for russia that France should be strong. She must also have a Government disposed to co-operate with the Soviet Government and unlikely to be attracted by post-warmanoeuvres for any anti-Soviet combination. Hence the interest shown by moscow in General de Gaulle in the early days and their anxiety to ensure that the progressive elements under his leadership should be pre-eminent in the restorationof France.4. It is thus likely that a close Franco-Russian understanding will become an established fact in post-war Europe. There is no reason, however, why this understanding should prejudice our relations with either party; indeed, if weplay our cards rightly, it may well help to consolidate our relations with bothFrance and Russia.5.&quot; On the French side, the indications are that all parties in the french committee and among the Resistance groups realise that, for geographicalreasons, solidarity with Britain is essential for France&apos;s security. Irritation with british tactics may lead at times to irresponsible talk about making common causewith Russia against the Anglo-Saxon Powers, but such talk need not be takenseriously and, as stated below, there is no reason to suppose that the SovietGovernment are working in that direction. The position would, of course, be different if there were to emerge in France after the war a Communist regimelooking exclusively to Moscow for support and guidance. Such a development is unlikely. The Communists will, of course, be influential as a well-organised and active political party; the centre of political gravity is likely to move to the left; and there may even be a tendency amongst the younger generation to look to Moscow rather than to London or Washington for leadership. But Frenchmenas a whole will never take willingly to regimentation whether of the Left or theRight, and any attempt to impose Communism on them as a system of governmentwould almost certainly be doomed to failure. It is well to bear in mind that, inspite of superficial appearances, recent history has shown that our best friends in France often incline politically to the Left.6. On the Russian side there is equally no reason to suppose that the SovietGovernment intend to exploit their relations with France to our disadvantage.They have made no attempt to fish in the troubled waters caused by Anglo-American differences over the treatment of the French Committee. There isno evidence that they are at present interfering in French internal affairs witha view to increasing Communist influence. Russian interests will be better served by the maintenance of a Government of the &apos;&quot;&apos; popular front&quot; type in which theCommunist party plays an important but not necessarily predominant role.7. Even without the installation of a Communist regime in France it mighthave been thought that the Soviet Government would seek to turn their Frenchconnexion against us by building up France as an additional fourth Great power which could be relied on to vote with themselves against Great Britain and theUnited States on post-war international bodies. There are, however, no signsof this. Although they championed General de Gaulle when his future was uncertain, the Soviet Government have shown no eagerness to sponsor Frenchclaims to Great Power status now that he is firmly established.   At Tehran and
on other occasions Marshal Stalin has taken the line that the French must provetheir worth before getting back to their former status; the Soviet representative on the Italian Advisory Council has shown little sympathy with the claims ofhis French colleague; and we know that the Soviet Government do not supportFrench claims for membership of the European Advisory Commission. Sovietinterest in France at present, at any rate, does not extend to any eagerness tosee her placed on a footing of equality with the Big Three.8. There is, therefore, nothing abnormal in Franco-Russian rapprochementand no reason why it should conflict with. British interests in France. It is unlikely that the Soviet Government will seek to establish exclusive influence orwill quarrel with British policy directed towards restoring France to her pre-war position. His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, should not seek an exclusiveposition and, indeed, it should be their endeavour to bring their relations with both France and Russia into the same terms of mutual confidence and equality.ANNEX III.Central Europe.THE main Soviet interest in Central Europe is to prevent conditionsreturning in which Germany will again be an actual or potential threat to Russiansecurity and in which the Central European States between Germany and russia will be faced with the choice of either co-operating with or being overrun byGermany and so ceasing to exist as independent nations. The maintenance ofthe independence of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria against german infiltration, and the linking up of at least the first three within theRussian security system in Eastern Europe is as vital an interest of the SovietGovernment as is the independence of the Western European States to us.Russia has hitherto shown herself suspicious of these Central European Statesforming a federation since she fears that such a bloc under Polish leadershipmight be as hostile to Russia as to Germany and might result in a revival of theold &quot;cordon sanitaire &quot; which followed the Bolshevik revolution.2. The Soviet-Czechoslovak Treaty is probably a true indication of soviet policy in Central Europe. It binds Czechoslovakia closely to the Soviet Union,and also provides for the subsequent accession of neighbouring States, e.g.,Poland, in resistance to German aggression. There is no reason to suppose thatthe treaty could not be further extended to include Hungary and Austria ifthe future regimes and policies of those countries made such a course desirable.3. Although Soviet policy is fundamentally hostile to the pre-war semi-authoritarian regime in Poland, and to the Hungarian oligarchy, there havebeen no signs of any Soviet desire to impose Communist regimes in any of theseCentral European countries. In fact, Russian relations are closest with Czecbo-slovakia, which is a &quot;petit bourgeois&quot; country with a capitalist structure of society and a prosperous lower-middle class and peasantry.4. The above general consider at jns apply to the area as a whole but theposition differs considerably in the individual countries which, therefore, requireseparate treatment.Poland.5. There is, unfortunately, a long tradition of deep-seated hostility between poland and Russia, embittered by the Soviet entry into Poland in September 1939and by subsequent Polish-Soviet differences during the war. Russia is deter-mined to prevent any revival of Polish policy as it existed between the two wars,when Poland had ambitions to play the role of a Great Power, to act as a balance between Germany and Russia, and, in alliance with the Great Powers of theWest, as a barrier against closer Russian contacts with Europe. Soviet policyis, therefore, fundamentally opposed to the return to power of any of thepre-war Polish ruling elements and to any revival of the Pilsudski tradition.She is determined to eradicate once and for all the possibility of territorialdisputes between Poland and Russia in the East and at the same time futurePolish-German rapprochement would be made impossible by the extension of polish frontiers at German expense to the Baltic and to the West.   There have
been signs that the Russians are ready to welcome a new regime in Poland witha broad basis of popular support in the democratic Peasant and Socialist parties.While Russian territorial and strategic requirements will certainly be far-reaching, there is some reason to hope &quot;that, provided such a democratic regimetakes root, Poland will be left with genuine independence and free fromexcessive Russian interference in her internal affairs.6. Poland, however, provides the most likely source of dispute between thiscountry and Russia in view of our special relations with Poland arising out ofthe Anglo-Polish Alliance and of the facr, that the war arose out of Polishresistance to German aggression. ^Large numbers of Poles have, unfortunately,pinned their faith to British and American support against the territorial and strategic demands which Russia will make of Poland. It would be fatal notonly to Anglo-Soviet relations and therefore to the future prospects of peace in Europe, but also to Poland herself if we encouraged the Poles to rely upon such support instead of staking everything upon achieving good relations withRussia. At the same time, there are clearly limits to the concessions which Polandcan be expected to make and which this country could condone. Soviet intentions as at present known to us, however, justify confidence that an acceptable solutioncan be found as a result of which there should emerge from this war a strong and independent Poland with its centre of gravity moved to the West and tothe Baltic, and closehy allied with Russia. Once Soviet suspicions regardingPolish intentions and even British policy towards Poland have been&quot; finallyremoved, there is no reason why we should not take every opportunity to increase our economic exchanges with Poland and to spread British influence, chiefly inthe cultural sphere. We should, however, be most careful not to undertakemilitary commitments in regard to Poland except jointly with the Russians.We should equally avoid encouraging the Poles to look westwards to London tothe exclusion of cultivating their all-important relations with Russia and weshould prevent misunderstandings by exchanging views with the Soviet Govern-ment in regard to Poland.7. To sum up, we should therefore continue our present policy of encouraging-ing in every way possible a resumption of relations between Russia and poland and a final solution of Polish-Soviet territorial a.nd strategic problems. We shouldcontinue to support the Polish Government under Mikolajczyk, who representsprecisely those solid democratic elements on which the future Poland can best be built. Without intervening directly more than is necessary, we should atthe same time show the Soviet Union that a fair deal for Poland is essential to future good relations between Britain and Russia, while also encouraging thePoles to face realities and to show a reasonable spirit of compromise.Czechoslovakia.8. Relations between Russia and the territories now comprising Czeeho-slovakia have been traditionally friendly. There has never been any source of dispute, and the Soviet Union clearly bases its Central European policy largely upon the fixed point of the Soviet-Czechoslovak Treaty of 1943. Soviet readiness to leave Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia within Czechoslovakia despite the closekinship between the Ruthenians and the Ukrainians is a measure of Soviet confi-dence in Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union also seems perfectly prepared toaccept the present social structure in Czechoslovakia, and to deal with thebourgeois politicans who form the present Czechoslovak Government. russia is probably sufficiently sure of Czechoslovak support in the last resort to raise noobjection to Dr. Benes&apos;s policy of maintaining a balance between the East and theWest, and therefore of strengthening his ties with this country and with france as a counterpart to the Czech-Soviet Treaty. In fact, Czechoslovakia is probablyas useful to Russia as a link with the West as she may be to us as a link with theEast.9. It is clearly unnecessary and undesirable for this country to assumemilitary commitments in Czechoslovakia similar to those assumed by Russia underthe Czech-Soviet Treaty. On the other hand, it is to our interest that Czecho-slovakia should remain independent and strong, and for that purpose should be protected from any repetition of German aggression by reliance upon soviet military support. It is equally to our interest that Czechoslovakia should remain a stable political, social and economic element in Central Europe, and for that,purpose that our relations with the restored Czechoslovakia, which is likely toremain a &quot; petit bourgeois &quot; State as she was before the war, should be close and
intimate. Czechoslovakia will look, to this country for increased economic and cultural exchanges. We should be well advised to take advantage of this to spread British influence in Czechoslovakia and thus throughout Central Europe.A ustr/a.10. There is general agreement between the major and minor allies regard-ing the necessity for restoring and maintaining an independent Austria. Russiaand Great Britain together with America are pledged to this under the MoscowDeclaration of 1943. They have agreed upon the principle of a joint tripartiteoccupation of Austria and are working out plans for handing over Austria as a viable and independent State to the Austrian people at the earliest possible date.11. Immediately before the war Austria was divided broadly into(a) Nazis, (&amp;) the Catholic and Conservative peasantry&quot; (mainly ChristianSocialists), (c) the town workers with Left political views (mainly social democrats). After the war, the Christian Social and Social-Democrat partiesmay be expected to regain their former predominance while the Nazis will gounderground, Soviet policy might naturally be inclined to support any extremeLeft-wing Socialist group which may emerge but this support may well betempered by the fact that such circles have not in the past opposed a connexionwith Germany provided Germany was not under Nazi rule. As it is an importantinterest of Russia as much as of other European countries to maintain Austrianindependence, it is not likely that Russia will jeopardise this prospect by adopting an ideological policy in Austria. The restoration of an effectiveAustrian State will already be so formidable a jmaetical problem that it willrequire the greatest degree of co-operation between the major Allies and also with Austria&apos;s neighbours.12. Here the role of Czechoslovakia will be most important. It seems likely that Russia will be influenced by Czech washes and there is no doubt thatCzechoslovakia hopes to find in post-war Austria a republic with a similarsocial and economic structure to her own with whom close co-operation shouldbe possible. It will be all-important to find outlets for Austrian trade in the danube Basin and in this connexion it may be necessary to overcome Sovietsuspicions that Vienna might again become too powerful and act as a nucleusfor a Danubian Federation, which might aspire to the role of the old Austrian-Hungarian empire in the Balkans.13. Very little is known of present conditions and trends in Austria, buton the basis of such information as is available and of the declared intentions of the other interested Governments, there is no reason to suppose that soviet and British interests need clash in Austria. Since Austria can only be revivedby the active assistance of her neighbours and of the Great Powers it will be essential for British influence to be spread immediately and actively in Austriaby economic and cultural means and in the early stages by military occupation and direct participation in the machinery of government and control.Hungary.14. There is some danger of a clash of Soviet and British policy in hungary. There is not, it is true, any direct conflict between Hungary and russia and Hungarian participation in the war on the Eastern Front has hitherto been most half-hearted. On the other hand, Russia is likely to back the terri-torial claims against Hungary not only from our Allies, Czechoslovakia and yugoslavia, but also of Roumania, since Roumania could most easily be com-pensated for the loss of Bessarabia by receiving back the whole of Transylvania.Russia is, in particular, likely to support Czechoslovak policy in the DanubianBasin and Czechoslovakia is especially hostile to Hungary. Apart from this,the present regime and social structure of Plungary is not one which SovietRussia could be expected to condone, still less to support. In so far as soviet policy stops short at restoring their lost -territories to Czechoslovakia and yugoslavia; at promoting a more equitable territorial settlement in Transylvania;at insisting upon far-reaching measures of land reform and the substitution ofa more genuinely democratic regime for the present oligarchical structure of society and government, British and Soviet policy can go hand in hand, since we should also wish to promote all these objectives. There is, however, a dangerof more revolutionary developments in Flungary similar to the excesses of theBela Kun regime after the last war. It does not follow that the Soviet union would necessarily foster such developments, but, if chaotic conditions arose,
she might find it difficult to refrain from supporting the more extreme elements of the Left. Hungary&apos;s neighbours would also then be tempted to intervene in Hungary and might secure Soviet support for measures going beyond eventhe drastic Trianon Settlement.15. The primary British interest in the Danube Basin is the maintenanceof peace and the development of more prosperous economic conditions. It is,above all, important for us to remove, so far as possible, potential sources of futurewars. Although it is impossible, given the racial intermixtures and historicalexperiences of the Danubian nations, to bring about an absolutely just territorialsettlement, it should be possible to improve upon the Trianon Settlement to theextent of diminishing the relatively large number of Magyars under alien rule and so to enable Hungary to devote her energies to her own much-needed internalreforms without the constant irritant of territorial and racial grievances.Otherwise Hungary will remain a potential source of trouble in the DanubeBasin and, despite Hungarian dislike of Germany, she would no doubt once againlink her fortunes with Germany if there were any revival of German strengthand aggression. This is an argument which should appeal to the SovietGovernment.16. British policy should, therefore, aim at convincing Russia that our object is not to maintain an anachronistic regime, nor to back exaggeratedHungarian claims based on the old Crown of St. Stephen against Czechoslovakia,Yugoslavia or Roumania. We should work for land reform and the introductionof a more genuine democracy based upon the peasants, intellectuals and theworkers, who are at present largely deprived of political rights. We should use our influence to promote, above all, improved Hungarian-Czech relations; insist upon the maintenance of genuine Hungarian independence, and so make possiblethe integration of a reformed Hungary into the post-war Danubian system. Inall this we must be especially careful to steer clear of ideological issues, sinceHungary is second only to Spain as a country, capable of arousing the mostpassionate criticism and support in different circles in Great Britain. In so faras Hungary is a country with a Western outlook and not a Balkan country, anda country with no affinities with the Slav world, the desired reforms can probablybe promoted more effectively by British than by Soviet precepts. Without,therefore, attempting to displace Soviet influence, which must be great in central europe, we should not hesitate to make our voice heard in Hungary and to showthat we expect to be fully consulted regarding developments in that country.ANNEX IV.Italy.ITALY, as the first country on the European mainland to be freed from german occupation, is an interesting testing-ground of the attitude which theU.S.S.R. is likely to adopt in her post-war relations with European countries at any rate those which are not her neighbours. It is true that Italy, unlike allied countries in enemy occupation, was at war with the Soviet Union, but the SovietGovernment have adopted a far from vengeful attitude towards that country.Since the surrender of Italy they have taken a close interest in Italian affairs.They insisted on being associated with and signing the Armistice in September1943. On the occasion of the Foreign Ministers&apos; Conference in Moscow inOctober 1943 they pressed for a declaration on the lines of that ultimately issuedabout the extirpation of Fascism and the democratisation of the Italian Govern-ment. They readily fell in with my proposal for the establishment of an AdvisoryCouncil for Italy and appointed as their first representative no less a personthan M. Vyshinski, the Vice-Commissar for Foreign Affairs. They have continued since then to maintain their close interest in Italian affairs, and, onthe ground that their representation in Italy was not on a basis of equality withthat of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government, despiteAnglo-American agreement to the appointment of Soviet representatives to theA.C.C., they established, without prior notification to His Majesty&apos;s government or to the United States Government, direct relations with the Italian Governmentand proceeded to an exchange of representatives. They have a formidable staffof officials in Italy attached to the Soviet representative to the Advisory Council,to the Soviet representative to the Italian Government and to the Soviet member[27978] ,      c
of the Control Commission. Through this body of officials they maintain close relations with the Italian Communist party, and there is good evidence thatthe latter are supplied by the Soviet Government with ample funds. They askedfor, and secured, permission for the return to Italy from Moscow of the formerItalian member of the Comintern, Togliatti, alias Ercoli, who is now theacknowledged leader of the Italian Communists. In his dealings with the UnitedStates and British authorities in Italy, on whose shoulders fall the responsibilityof controlling, directly or indirectly, under the Armistice, practically all Italianactivities, the Soviet representative on the Advisory Council has consistentlyadopted a studiously reasonable attitude and has concentrated upon increasingthe Italian war effort. Clearly under orders from Moscow, the Italian Communistparty, which had been campaigning against the monarchy/ and Marshal Badoglio,suddenly changed its tune and advocated co-operation with King Victor and marshal Bado2;lio&apos;s Government. The Communist Party is now advocatingCommunist-Catholic co-operation. It is, however, true that the ItalianCommunist party have lost no opportunity of belittling and criticising Alliedactivities in Italy, though in a manner to which it is difficult to take exception,and of belauding the achievements of the Soviet Union, both in peace and war.2. It is evident that the Soviet Government, in order to establish their position in post-war Italy, intend to maintain tight control over the ItalianCommunist party&apos;, which at present is wholly subservient to orders from Moscow,and that the considerable support which the Italian Communist party  enjoyrs fromthe Soviet Government is not likely to diminish, and no doubt every effort willbe made as hitherto to promote its interests at the expense of the orthodox socialist parties. In all probability a wide measure of success may- be expected to attendthese efforts, since there is not only a natural tendency to swing from one extremeto another, from Fascism to Communism, but the Italian Communist party, likethe Communist parties in other countries in which dictatorships have nourished,has not only the glamour of having been persecuted by Fascism but of havingsurvived this persecution, to emerge with a more energetic and effective programme and appeal than that of any other anti-Fascist party-. To these advantages wallbe added, as the north of Italy7 is freed, the stronghold of Communism among theindustrial cities and the heroes of the North Italian resistance movement, whichis to a great extent Communist-led and inspired. Finally, Italy&apos;s economic position after the war is likely to be very- bad, with the result that a further-impetus may well thus be given to the spread of Communism.3. But a strong and active Communist party in Italy- does not necessarilymean that the Italian Government will fall under Communist control. There arestrong anti-Communist elements in Italy, and these may be expected gradually- to reorganise and reassert themselves as the country settles down once again to moreor less normal conditions. These elements will certainly7 look to Great Britain andthe United States for encouragement and support, and their resurgence and their capacity to establish themselves in power may well depend on how far in practicethey will receive from us this encouragement and support. But even so the ItalianCommunist Party will be anxious mot to appear as anti-British, for if the SovietGovernment are interested in post-war Italy and are resolved to exercise influencethere, this is not merely or even at all because they wish to impose a Communistregime on Italy, but because they will see in a strong Communist party the bestguarantee against the clanger of Italy being drawn back into the German orbit.Incidentally7, if the fortunes of the Italian Communist party continue to grow, weshall no doubt find the Soviet Government inclined at the peace settlement to resist the imposition on Italy of stern terms and sanctions which Great Britain and theUnited States might wish to advocate.ANN FX V.The Low Countries and Switzerland.RUSSIA has traditionally shown little if any interest in either of the low countries and Marshal Stalin indicated to the Foreign Secretary in Moscow in1941 that he regarded them as falling entirely within the British sphere ofinterest. We should act on the assumption that Russia could only welcome the strengthening of links between Great Britain and Belgium and Holland andwould like to see these two countries built up as a more effective barrier againstGermany in the North-West.
2. It is true that there have in the past been strong ideological and religiousprejudices in both Belgium and Holland against the Soviet Union. Belgiumonly resumed diplomatic relations with Russia shortly before the war and Hollandonly some time after she had entered into the war. There are Communist parties in both countries but these have not in the past played any great part, e.g.,comparable to that of the Communist party in Fiance. &apos; Granted an early returnto relatively stable economic and political&apos;conditions after the war, there seemsno reason to anticipate any important growth in the Communist movements in either country. The social structure in both Holland and Belgium is funda-mentally sound and the standard of living has been extremely high. The existenceof a liberal monarchy, coupled with the general acceptance of a genuinedemocratic political structure and the strength of the Churches in both countries,all make for political stability and should preclude any situation arising inwhich the Russians might find it difficult to resist the temptation to intervene inDutch or Belgian affairs in a sense contrary to British interests.3. Our policy in Belgium and Holland should, therefore, be to strengthen our political and strategic links to the maximum extent compatible with whateverworld and regional organisations may emerge from the war; to collaborate closely with both countries in colonial questions, and to develop our commercial exchangeswith these prosperous and highly developed Western democracies. They maybe relied upon, in their own interests, to maintain correct relations with theSoviet Union and no intervention on our part would seem necessary in this connexion. In so far as our foreign policy in Western Europe must be basedmainly upon close and friendly relations with France, we should encourage bothBelgium and Holland to resume closer relations with France than those existingbefore the war.4.   Switzerland as a prosperous and efficient democratic State with a social&apos;structure similar to our own and to that of Holland and Belgium can perhaps alsoconveniently be considered in this connexion.5. Switzerland has hitherto never entered into relations with the soviet union. Before the war, however, there were growing economic connexions betweenthe two countries and the Swiss Federal Council are now only awaiting a suitable opportunity to enter into relations with Moscow. Russia has traditionally shownlittle if any interest in Switzerland, and within the last one hundred and fifty years has only come into close contact with Swiss affairs during Suvorov&apos;campaing in the Alps against the French revolutionary armies. There is a smallCommunist party in Switzerland, but the Swiss do not take kindly to politicalextremes, whether Communist or Fascist. Switzerland is likely to emerge fromthis war with an exceptionally stable and democratic social structure. There isno reason to anticipate an active Russian policy in Switzerland and still less onehostile to British interests. These require the maintenance of a stable and neutralSwitzerland, with whom our relations are likely to remain cordial although not so intimate nor so strategically vital to our security as those with the other smallerWestern democracies, Holland and Belgium.ANNEX VI.Scandinavia.THE Soviet Government regard Finland as part of their security sphere.Marshal Stalin, in outlining to me the map of Europe after the war during our conversations in Moscow in December 1941, said that the Soviet Governmentwould like to see the frontier with Finland restored to its position in 1941, thatthey considered that there should be some relationship in the nature of a military alliance between the Soviet Union and Finland, giving the former the right tomaintain naval and military bases on Finnish territory and that they wantedPetsamo back. Nothing has occurred since to indicate a change of view. In thecourse of the abortive armistice negotiations in April this year His Majesty&apos;sGovernment agreed to the Soviet Union including the surrender to them ofthe Petsamo district in the armistice terms. Although we shall no doubt hopethat Finland will be left some real degree of at least cultural and commercialindependence and a Parliamentary regime, Russian influence will in any event be predominant in Finland and we shall not be able, nor would it serve any important British interests, to contest that influence.[27978] d
2. In the course of the conversations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, Marshal Stalin made two other statements affectingScandinavia. After dealing with the frontiers of certain occupied countries, hesaid that all other occupied countries should be restored to their original frontiers;that would include Norway and Denmark. He also said that the Soviet Govern-ment would have no objection to Great Britain having naval bases in Norwayor Denmark, but would like a guarantee by certain Powers as to the entrance to the Baltic Sea. Since that time, nothing has occurred to suggest any changein the Soviet view on these matters.3. It is sometimes suggested that Russia covets further ice-free ports inthe north. But she will regain such an ice-free port in Petsamo, and I regard it as in the highest degree unlikely that Russia would attempt to seize territory in Northern Norway for this purpose.4. I see no reason, therefore, to foresee any important clash of interests withRussia in Scandinavia. She may, there as elsewhere, tend to support the Left-wing parties. But the traditions of western civilisation and western democracyare strongly established in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the Trades unions are politically powerful, the large majority in all three countries feel a greatloyalty to their ruling monarchs (although this loyalty may not be so much enjoyed by their successors), and there is in all three a powerful religious influence. Theyare none of them fertile ground for the seed of communism.ANNEX VII.The Iberian Peninsula.RUSSIA has no direct strategic or economic interests in either Spain orPortugal.&apos; Her interest in these countries has been fitful and intermittent, andhas only been of importance when developments in the Iberian Peninsulaappeared likely to affect the general balance of forces throughout Europe. Eorexample, after the Napoleonic wars Alexander I showed considerable interest,although largely on ideological grounds, in the issue of absolutism versusliberalism in Spain and Portugal. Russian interest in these countries thenremained dormant until the Spanish Civil War when, partly for ideological butmainly for severely practical reasons, direct assistance was given to the SpanishLeft in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the victory of the Right, who were then in close alliance with the Nazi and Fascist enemies of Russia. Russian inter-vention in the Spanish Civil War has left an aftermath of hatred and fear notonly among the elements now dominant in Spain, but throughout the Spanishmiddle classes, who associate their fear of local communism and anarchy withRussia. The Spanish Government, until recently, maintained the Blue Divisionfighting with the Germans in Russia, and they make no pretence of neutrality intheir attitude to the war in Eastern Europe.2. The Soviet Government have nevertheless, despite the wild flights of soviet propaganda, adopted a realistic attitude towards British and Americanpolicy in Spain, and have only been critical when British and american public opinion also seemed critical of this policy. Russia is likely to continue torealise that Britain has a particularly close strategic and political interest in the approaches to the Western Mediterranean, and therefore in preventing Spainbecoming an enemy or falling under strong enemy influence. She has no sufficient motive for challenging our position at Gibraltar nor generally in Spain,although she. might wish to be associated with future security arrangements inthe Gibraltar area, if other vital strategical areas throughout the world were alsoplaced under some United Nations bases regime.3. There is clearly little prospect of any resumption of normal, still less of friendly, relations between the present Spanish regime and the Soviet Union. Itis, however, unlikely that the present Spanish regime will long survive the war.The most likely development would be the substitution either (a) of a moderateRepublic or (&amp;) of a liberal Monarchy, either of which could only be introducedwith the goodwill and active support of the army, which has for 150 years beenthe dominant force in Spanish internal politics. A third and more disturbingpossibility would be (c) a revolutionary movement of the extreme Left, whichwould almost certainly lead to a return to the chaotic conditions of the civil war.
In either of the first two eventualities it seems unlikely that Russia would wish toplay any very active&quot;role in Spain. We should then encourage the resumption ofmore normal Russo-Spanish relations but, as the bitterness left by the civil war has not yet died down, we should not press the pace unduly. It should not, infact, be impossible to continue to treat the Iberian Peninsula in the post-war period as a special case, where Britain and America can play a predominant rolewithout Russia, while avoiding any adverse effects upon general Anglo-soviet relations.4. The third eventuality, (c) revolutionary and chaotic conditions in Spainmight, however, impose a very heavy strain upon Anglo-Soviet relations. Itwould be a hard task to persuade the Soviet Government to refrain from backingExtreme Left elements and, since British opinion would no doubt again be dividedon this issue, we should again be faced with a situation similar to that in theSpanish Civil War. Given the bitterness of Spanish political passions, this possibility cannot be excluded and therefore, until there is greater certainty of stability in Spain it might not be in our interests for a Russian Embassy to bere-established in Madrid, where it must almost inevitably act as a focus fordiscontented elements of the Left.5. Portugal presents fewer difficulties. The Soviet Government will nodoubt continue to recognise the special Anglo-Portuguese relationship consecratedin the Alliance and to balance this against any objections they may have to thepresent Portuguese regime. This regime is, in fact, a relatively mild and benignform of dictatorship. So long as Dr. Salazar remains at the helm, and he is acomparatively young man, there is no reason to suppose that it will not maintainitself, effecting no doubt the essential minimum of changes to enable it to take its place in the post-war world. Alternatively, there will be a return to democraticforms of government, but in either event Portuguese policy will remain firmlybased upon the Alliance. Here again a resumption of normal relations withRussia would be advisable and Dr. Salazar may well himself work for this indue course, without any pressure from us. It is not, however, necessary, nor inour own interests, to press the pace.
