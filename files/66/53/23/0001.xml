(44) 423.31st July, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER-ALLOCATION TO THE ROYAL AIR FORCE ANDTHE MINISTRY OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.Note by the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of aircraft production.IN W.M. (44) 90th Conclusions the War Cabinet decided that an examination should be undertaken by the Defence Committee of the assumptionas to the strength of the Royal Air Force in 1945 to which the current programme should be related.2. In this connection the Prime Minister has asked for a memorandum tobe circulated containing the information which follows : (a) The planned expansion of the R.A.F. between now and the end of 1945on the assumption that the war with Germany continues.R.A.F. expansion is planned to reach its peak at September 1945 on the basisof the 1944 man-power allocations previously decided (see paragraph 10 of w.P. (43) 539). Assuming no cuts in the M.A.P. programme, planned expansionis as follows : 30th June, 31st Dec, 30th Sept.,1944- 1944- 1945.Heavy   and   Medium   bomber squadrons.........        89 100 115Other Squadrons ......      413 422 422502 522 537(b) The effect on this planned expansion of the cut in man-power for M.A.P.proposed in the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper.Account has to be taken not only of the cut of 112,000 during the remainder of the year, proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but also of the factthat the M.A.P. labour force has already been reduced, in the first half of 1944,at least to the full extent of the cut of 68,000 previously proposed for the full year,with the consequent effect of a loss of output during the second half of the year.It is only possible to arrive at an estimate of the effect of the cut by making certain assumptions about the M.A.P. labour force in 1944 and 1945, which areas follows : (i) that the aggregate M.A.P. labour force would be maintained, throughout1945 at the level (1,641,000) to which it would decline by the end of1944;(ii) that, while keeping within this aggregate of 1,641,000, the labourallocated to individual * factories would be kept up to the numbersnecessary to fulfil the reduced programme; and(iii) that the cut in the M.A .P. force would be spread between skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers so as to maintain the same proportionsas in the present force.[27923]        &apos; :
On these assumptions the effect on the main types, after taking all possible cuts inother types, would be : A loss of 3 Lancaster and 7 Halifax Squadrons at September 1945, anda total loss of bombs dropped of some 35,000 tons up to that date.Delay in re-equipping with the latest types of aircraft fighter squadronsplanned to be re-equipped with Tempest, Spiteful and Spitfire 21.If the foregoing assumptions (i), (ii) and (iii) are falsified, as they may wellbe, there will in addition be an unpredictable loss of aircraft production with an equally unpredictable effect on the size and degree of modernisation of the R.A.F.(c) The effect on the man-power requirements of the R.A.F. and of M.A.P.of a decision that the R.A.F. should not be expanded beyond the sizeto be reached (under present plans) by the end of 1944.In this event, a R.A.F. intake of 9,700 would be required in the last half of1944, and some 4,500 men could be released in the first six months of 1945. Sofar as the M.A.P. labour force is concerned, a reduction of 130,000 would resultin the second half of 1944, instead of 112,000. Since the only expansion due afterthe 31st December, 1944, is in heavy bomber squadrons, this reduction in theM.A.P. labour force would fall mainly on factories engaged in heavy bomberproduction, but the detailed making of cuts would have to be arranged between our two Departments and in the light of the practical possibilities arising fromthe immobility of labour. A further loss of aircraft after that date and a partialdeferment of re-equipment with modern types would be involved unless (i) thelabour force at other factories could be built up to programme requirementsduring the second half of 1944, and (ii) the labour force could be maintained atall factories throughout 1945 at the level, both of quantity and quality, requiredto be reached by the end, of 1944.3. La arriving at the conclusions under (b) and (c) above it has been assumed that the Fleet Air Arm bears an appropriate portion of the cut of 112,000 inthe M.A.P. total labour force.A. H. M. S.R. S. C.Offices of the War Cabinet,31st July, 1944.
