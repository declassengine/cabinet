THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 443.12th August, 1944.WAR CABINET.CONSTITUENT REPUBLICS OF THE SOVIET UNION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.AT their Meeting on the 5th June (W.M. (44) 72nd Conclusions), the WarCabinet approved a proposal by the Foreign Secretary in W.P. (44) 284 thatthe views of the Dominion Governments should be sought on the policy to beadopted in the event of a request being received from the Soviet Governmentfor the appointment of separate representatives to the Ukraine and other soviet union Republics. I annex copies of the telegrams subsequently exchanged with dominion Governments. All the Dominion Governments are fully in agreementwith the policy which we suggested to them.A copy of the latest telegram sent to Dominion Governments on the subject is also annexed.C.Dominions Office, 12th August, 1944.ANNEX I.Telegram of the 20th June, 1944, from the Dominions Office to DominionGovernments.(D. No. 947. Secret.)Following recent constitutional changes in the U.S.S.R., Commissars forForeign Affairs have been appointed for the Ukrainian, Byelo-Russian andother constituent Republics of the Soviet Union.2. United Kingdom Ambassador, Moscow, thinks it possible that we may at some stage be faced with a definite request from Soviet Government to appoint a separate representative to the Ukraine, and we have accordingly been considering what should be our attitude in that event.3. It may be that Soviet Government may seek to draw a parallel betweenthe new position in foreign affairs of the constituent Soviet Republics and theposition of the Dominions. It has, of course, already been explained in thememorandum handed to the Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires in London, of which a copywas enclosed in my circular despatch D. No. 79 of the 3rd September, 1943, thatthere is no such resemblance. If an analogy to the position of the Union Republicsis to be sought, it is to be found not in the British Commonwealth, but in theGerman Reich as it existed between  1870 and 1918, where some of the constituentStates were allowed to exercise a certain limited control in foreign affairs andin army matters, and for that purpose received and appointed diplomatic representatives.4. We feel, however, that it would be difficult indefinitely to withholdrecognition of the international status of the 16 constituent Republics. If theU.S.S.R. is determined on this development of its international position, itwould probably be impossible to persuade all the United Nations to stand firmrefusing recognition and once one country accorded recognition others would follow and our position, if we stood out, would cause great resentment in theU.S.S.R.
5. At the same time, we see no advantage in hastening such recognition.Moreover, there would be difficulties in regard to immediate establishment of separate United Kingdom representatives in the Ukraine for three reasons : (1) We might find ourselves being represented as having recognised theUkrainian Republics claim to parts of Eastern Poland. Since theclaimed territory would be only a small proportion of the totalterritory of the Republic, such a contention would not be good in law.Nevertheless, the situation might be embarrassing.(2) If we established separate representatives in the Ukraine, SovietGovernment might apply pressure publicly to induce us to do thesame for the Byelo-Russian Republic which claims parts of EasternPoland amounting to approximately as much territory as the wholepre-1939 extent of the Republic.(3) The Baltic States Republics might put in similar requests for UnitedKingdom representatives, when freed from the Germans, which ifgranted would involve recognition of incorporation of the Baltic states in the Soviet Union.6. In all the circumstances, we suggest that it should be our aim to try to postpone question of recognition of the 16 constituent Republics until the peace settlement. We should, however, be grateful to learn views of Dominion Govern-ments on the matter.7. If the Dominion Governments agree with the line proposed above, wewould suggest that all British Commonwealth Governments should keep eachother informed of any Russian move bearing on this matter. &apos; We should also propose to inform the United States Government and ask them to keep in contact with us on the subject. We would also suggest that the various representatives in Moscow should be instructed to exchange information on it.8. We should be grateful for comments of Dominion Governments as soonas convenient.ANNEX II.Letter of the 3rd July, 1944, from the High Commissioner for the Union ofSouth Africa.My dear Secretary of State,In reply to your Circular Telegram D. No. 947, regarding the possibilityof a Soviet request for the exchange of diplomatic representatives with theUkraine, my Government have asked me to inform you that they are in agree-ment with the views of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in the United Kingdom on thesubject of the appointment of a separate representative to the Ukraine. they agree also as to the desirability of an attempt to postpone the question of recognition of the sixteen Constituent Representatives until the Peace Settle-ment, when European boundaries and other factors should be much clearer thanthey are now.They will not fail to keep the United Kingdom and other DominionGovernments informed of any Russian move bearing on the matter which may come to their notice. The remaining proposals in the telegram under referencealso find favour.The above message has been repeated to the Australian and New zealand governments and to the South African Accredited Representative in Ottawafor transmission to the Canadian Government.Copies of this letter have been sent to the respective High commissioners in London.Yours sincerely,(Signed) DENEYS REITZ.ANNEX III.Telegram of the 5th July, 1944, from the Australian Government.(No. 156.   Secret.)YOUR telegram D. No. 947, 29th June. Recognition of constituentrepublics in U.S.S.R. We agree that in view of delicate questions involved itwould be advantageous if recognition could be postponed until peace settlement
provided this can be done without causing offence. We have felt, however, sinceannouncement of the 3rd February, 1944, that one of the reasons for this stepwas fear, that the Soviet Union might be outvoted on&apos; international conferencesor peace organisations. This aspect was brought to fore at time of creationof War Crimes Commission when question of separate Dominion representationwas specifically raised and we were compelled to present a note pointing outstatus of members of British Commonwealth. If there is substance in this viewwe believe that Soviet Government will, in fact, raise the issue before peace settlement. We should, therefore, have in mind how this position will be met.We believe it will have to be accepted with grace rather than risk differencewith U.S.S.R. especially in view of our acceptance in principle of ultimateincorporation of Baltic States and Soviet Governments claims in respect of itsWestern Frontiers.We certainly agree that all British Commonwealth Governments should keepeach other informed of any Soviet move bearing on this matter and that the variousrepresentatives in Moscow should be instructed to exchange information on any development.   His Majesty&apos;s Australian Minister is being informed accordingly.ANNEX IV.Telegram of the 8th July, 1944, from the Netv Zealand Government.(No. 166.   Secret.)Your telegram D. No. 947.We concur in the views stated in your message regarding recognition of theconstituent Republics of the U.S.S.R. It is evident that the Soviet authoritiesattach importance to the development in international status of their constituentRepublics and it is likely, therefore, that the question may be raised with us evenin advance of the peace settlement. While nothing need be done to accelerate this development, it would be difficult to delay recognition when the issue is reallyraised, and this may cause immediate embarrassment and possibly prejudice insome way our future relations with the U.S.S.R. It is probable, in any event, thatsome countries would concede recognition immediately on request.2. We agree that members of the Commonwealth should keep each otherinformed of developments, and their respective representatives in Moscow should keep in contact on the subject. We are informing our Minister-Designateaccordingly.ANNEX &quot;V.Telegram of the 13th July, 1944, from the Canadian Government.(No. 118.   Secret.)1. Your telegram D. No. 947, 29th June. Soviet constitutional changes.We agree with your views on the course to be adopted in the event that a request ismade by the Soviet Government for appointment of a separate representative tothe Ukraine, and we shall be glad to keep you and other Commonwealth Govern-ments informed of any Russian move which comes to our notice. We have instructed the Canadian Ambassador, Moscow, to keep in touch with other commonwealth representatives there.2. In view of the substantial number of persons of Ukrainian origin inCanada, we consider it not unlikely that the Soviet Government might alsosuggest an exchange of representatives between Canada and the Ukraine.3. We think that the following points, in addition to or in elaboration ofthe points mentioned in your telegram, should be kept in mind : (a) The case of each Soviet Republic for separate recognition in this mannershould be considered on its merits. The arguments for recognition arestrongest in the case of the Ukraine, which is the second largest SlavState, and holds an important place in world economy. Any agree-ment to exchange representatives with the Ukraine should not beconsidered a precedent establishing the international status of all otherSoviet Republics. In this way we could go some distance to avoidreviving the undesirable controversy over the alleged analogy betweenthe status of these Republics and that of the countries of the BritishCommonwealth.
(b) We agree that it is desirable to postpone acceptance of separate Diplo-matic Representation of the Ukraine until after the peace settlement.The Soviet Government may press the matter before then and, if so, itmight be more conducive to Allied unity if recognition were grantedpromptly, since it seems impossible to resist a Soviet request in thelong run.(c) In the meantime, nothing should be done which might suggest to theSoviet Government that they would receive a favourable reply if theyshould ask, now or later, for an exchange of representatives with theUkraine or other Soviet Republics, or &quot;for recognition of the inter-national status of the Republics in some other manner.ANNEX VI.Telegram of the 11th August, 1944, from the Dominions Office to DominionGovernments.(D. No. 1133.   Secret.)My telegram D. No. 947 of 29th June.Possible Soviet request for exchange of diplomatic representatives with individual Soviet Union Republics.1. We are grateful for views expressed on our suggestions on this matterand are glad to know that there is complete agreement between us.2. United Kingdom Ambassador, Washington, has now; been informed thatthe five British Commonwealth Governments concerned have agreed that theUnited Kingdom Government should inform the United States Government oftheir joint views on this matter, and should ask the United States Governmentequally to keep in contact with us in regard to it and to instruct the United states ambassador in Moscow to keep in contact with his British Commonwealthcolleagues. United Kingdom Ambassador, Washington, has been instructed to approach United States Government accordingly after informing dominion representatives in Washington.3. United Kingdom Ambassador, Moscow, has also been instructed to exchange any information on&apos;this subject with his other British Commonwealthcolleagues.4. We have carefully considered suggestion in paragraph 3 (a) of canadian government&apos;s telegram No. 118 of 13th July that case for exchange of separaterepresentatives with each particular Soviet Union Republic should, when an approach is received from the Soviet Government, be considered on its merits, andthat any agreement to exchange representatives with the Ukraine should not beconsidered a precedent establishing the international status of all other SovietRepublics. Exchange of representatives with one Soviet Republic would,however, constitute recognition of its independent international status, and we feel that once independent international status of one of the constituent Republicsis recognised in this way, principle would be conceded and independentinternational status of the other Republics could not consistently be contested.In the circumstances we think it best to adhere to the suggestion in paragraph 7of my telegram D. No. 947 of 29th June that action to be taken on any approachfrom the Soviet side for the exchange of diplomatic representatives with anyparticular Soviet Republic should be considered on its merits in consultation whenthe occasion arises.
