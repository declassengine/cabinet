THE recent speech by General Franco compels a review of our policy in spain. This speech was mainly directed against the U.S.A., but it was also an expression of confidence in German victory and contained some unfriendlyreferences to the United Kingdom.2. No satisfactory explanation has yet been given of why General Francoperpetrated this outburst at this moment, but the outbreak of the German-Russianwar has caused considerable effervescence in Spain. The despatch of &quot; volun-teers &apos;&apos; to the Eastern Front has not been popular, and General Franco may havebeen persuaded that it was necessary to revive the flagging enthusiasm of theSpanish people. Whatever the cause, this speech has ranged General Francoalongside his brother-in-law, Senor Suner.3. It should be noted that, in spite of inflammatory speeches and propa-ganda in the Spanish press, there have been no threats to British interests or british subjects in Spain.4. The question is whether we wish at this moment to pick a quarrel withthe Spanish Government and, if not, what reaction we should make to general franco&apos;s speech.5. Our policy in Spain has been based exclusively on strategic considera-tions. The object has been to keep Spain out of the war, and we have used therather limited means at our disposal for this purpose, and to endeavour to stimulate a spirit of resistance and a realisation of the value of maintainingneutrality. While we have hitherto met with some success, it is likely that theoutbreak of the German-Russian war has greatly reduced any chance of Spainresisting German pressure. On the other hand, owing to the Eastern campaign,Germany is at present reluctant to send military help on any considerable scale to Spain. This favourable situation cannot be expected to last for more than sixor eight weeks.6. In the circumstances I do not consider that there is any advantage inhalf-measures., Either we should have the strategic advantages of Spain out ofthe war until it suits Germany to bring her in or the advantages, whatever theymay be, of Spain in the war at a moment to be chosen by us. I propose to ask forthis question to be considered by the Defence Committee:11439   [22739]
7. Meanwhile, a quarrel with Spain which did not lead to positive action would bring no advantages and a good many disadvantages.8. i The advantages we get from a neutral Spain are :  (i) Supplies of various kinds, especially large quantities of high-gradeiron-ore (about 60,000 tons a month). Owing to the short haul, tradewith Spain is very economical of shipping,(ii) The use of Gibraltar as a naval base, and as a staging point for the delivery of aircraft to the Middle East (an increasingly important use),is dependent on the maintenanceof Spanish neutrality. The Spaniardscould make the landing ground and possibly the harbour untenable,(iii) A quarrel with Spain must be expected ultimately to involve Portugal,with the ensuing complications in our relations with the Portuguese.The air link through Lisbon would then be interrupted.9. It may be added that at the present moment our commercial relationswith Spain are fairly satisfactory, and so is the position of British interests in spain. This is largely due to the helpful attitude of the present Spanish ministers of Commerce and of the Interior.10. While the present situation in Spain no doubt also has certain advant-ages for the Germans, a quarrel with the Spaniards would bring them far greatergains than it would to us, unless perhaps the quarrel was pushed to the point ofwar.11.. I feel, however, that it is essential to react in some way to the speechby General Franco, as our silence would not be understood either here or in othercountries. There is, in fact, not much more that we can do at present in the wayof affording the Spaniards economic assistance. The amount of goods whichthey can import is severely limited, both by supply and by shortage of shipping,and it is doubtful whether they can in fact obtain and import those goods whichthe Ministry of Economic Warfare are prepared to admit into Spain. There are,however, certain facilities which we could, if we wanted to, give, such asfacilities for the purchase of goods in South America for sterling. We have alsobeen urging the Americans, largely for strategic reasons, to improve their positionin Spain by offers of economic help. We can cease to do so, and it would be made clear in public that in view of General Franco&apos;s speech we cannot be expectedto go out of our way to help the Spaniards. I should not, however, at the momentpropose to take positive action in the way of blockading Spain.12. I therefore propose, in reply to any parliamentary enquiries, to speaksomewhat on the following lines : I should begin with a factual account of the steps we have taken and the efforts we have made to secure for Spain the supplies and the financial assistance which are needed for Spanish reconstruction. Wehad been prepared to continue our efforts in this direction. We had, however,been compelled to review this attitude in the light of General Franco&apos;s statement,and had concluded that we were no longer prepared to continue the efforts inwhich we had been engaged to provide special facilities and assistance while thehead of the Spanish State adopted so unfriendly an attitude to this country.13. I have asked His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid for his view on thisproposal.A. E.Foreign Office, July 20, 1941.
