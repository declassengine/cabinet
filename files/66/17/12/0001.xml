(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos; S GOVTWMENT) *28SECRET /      Copy No.,\7.1&apos;.(2hl)l39 , 21June 24th, 1941FUTURE OP THE MINISTRY OP INPORIIATIOH.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.1 .     The broad issue which the Cabinet has to decide is whether theHead of the Ministry of Information is to be a very important Minister chargedwith the conduct of political warfare and therefore having control of allpropaganda and publicity, or whether he is to be a high official with the duty ofcarrying out the directions   of   other     Departments and maintaining liaison between those Departments on the one hand and the press and the B.3.C. on theother.2.     All foreign propaganda must be carried out in close accordance with theforeign policy of the country.     It must therefore be the duty of the Minister ofInformation to accept general instructions from the Foreign Secretary from time&apos; totime on all questions of high policy, but he should bo left to decide for himself as to the manner and method whereby that policy is carried out.     He should have i charge of secret as well as overt, of cultural as well as j^sol^iijical -propaganda.iin order to ensure complete co-ordination through unity of command.3.     An important weapon in the conduct of political warfare is the presentation of news.     The responsibility of deciding what news should be released and themanner in which it should be presented should rest with the Minister ofInformation, subject to the veto of any &apos;of his Cabinet colleagues pending referenceto the Cabinet for decision.4.     It should be the duty of his Cabinet colleagues, especially the foreign secretary and the Service Ministers, to keep the Minister fully supplied with theinformation at their disposal.     Y/hether this duty will be best performed by having highly placed officers from the various Departments working in the ministry or by other means can. safely be left to the decision of the various ministers concerned.      It should be the duty of the Minister to supervise and co-coordinate the relations of other Departments with the Press, the B.B.C. and the film industry.      This should not mean that the other Depaidmients are in any waydebarred from having direct aocess to the Press on matters of a purelydepartmental nature     What is desired is that when Departments are launchingpublicity schemes they should consult and be guided by the Ministry, and whenthey organise press conferences the Ministry should be informed and invited tosend a representative.     A weekly meeting of the public relations officers of thevarious Departments held at the Ministry of Information should provide thenecessary machinery to carry out this purpose.5*     There is no reason why Departments should not produce for their owndepartmental purposes films of a technical nature.      It is however obviouslydesirable that Government Departments should not compete against one another for facilities, etc. in the film world, and it should therefore be laid down that allG-government Departments are to consult and obtain the approval of the Ministrybefore concluding any film contract.6.     If the Ministry is not to fulfil the functions laid down above it seemsdifficult to justify its continuance as a. separate Government Department   undera Cabinet 1&apos;Linister.     He ohould be replaced by an Executive official., thelit4 n,tion of whoso responsibilities should be announced.7.     There is however, another possibility.     The Ministry could be allowed todisintegrate into its component parts.8.     Foreign propaganda could be handed over to the Foreign Secretary, who might be well advised to appoint an additional Parliamentary Under Sexaretaxy-^dlOswould be responsible to him for the conduct of propaganda.
9.      The Ministry&apos;s present relations with the Press could be carriedout by a Press Bureau whose duty it would be to coordinate the relations of the various Departments with the press.      It might conveniently serve under the Home Office,10.    The regional activities of the Ministry could be transferred to theMinistry of Hone Security,     Already the Regional Information Officers in jthe twelve districts serve under the Regional Commissioners, although theyare officials of the Ministry of Information.      It -would be quite simplefor them to become,  as their local sirpcriors arc already,  officials ofthe Ministry of Home Security.11.    The Postal and Telegraph Censorship, which has been under the ministry for only a little more than twelve months, could easily be transferred toanother Ministry.12.    On the other hand the disintegration of the Ministry would not solve the problem of the B.B.C.     The B.B.C. is already less effective than itshould be and suffering from too many masters.      If the most powerfulpropaganda, weapon we possess is not to be wasted the B.B.C. must get its political direction from one Minister who is responsible for it.     TheMinister of Information can coordinate 3.3.C. publicity with other formsof publicity, but if the Ministry is abolished there must still be some -Minister in charge of the 3.3.0., and that Minister should, have in regardto broadcast publicity the authority which has been asked for above for a minister of Info mat ion in regard to publicity in general.13.    Owing to initial mistakes, many of then pre-natal, the Ministry has never enjoyed the full confidence of the public.      Once a Department hasincurred ridicule it has great difficulty in regaining its status.      I donot think that the Ministry has lost ground in the last year, but it hasa great deal of ground to make up, and unless it is given the authority which it demands there is danger of it ceasing to hea*m&amp; an object ofridicule in order to become one only of pity.D.C.
