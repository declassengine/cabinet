G. DILL.C. PORTAL.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 14, 1941.A. FRENCH.(i) Navy.The most important event to note is the decision of Admiral Muselier topay off some of his unreliable craft and to commission six new &quot; Flower &quot; ClassCorvettes placed at his disposal by the Admiralty.Two of these Corvettes are already in commission and will be shortly based in Newfoundland. The remaining four are expected to commission shortly andwill probably join the other two.The prospect of active service in new ships is having a good effect on officersand men of the Free French Navy.Training.; The manning of these Corvettes has imposed considerable strain on Free French resources as regards specialized ratings, particularly V/S, W/Tand A/S. Every assistance has been given in providing courses in these subjects as well as in Gunnery and Torpedo.Since the beginning of April 130 Free Frenchmen have been accepted forthe General Disciplinary Course in H.M.S. Royal Arthur. These courses are thebest possible thing for the Frenchmen.   The atmosphere of contented discipline[22674] b
and the sympathetic attention they receive at Skegness starts them off with ahigh morale and a desire to work closely with us.Sixteen French cadets are doing the special entry course at the Royal NavalCollege, Dartmouth. N.A. (F) 2 S.L. visited the Royal Naval College lately andwas much impressed with these youngsters and the way in which they had enteredinto the life of the College. They were very well reported on and are popular withthe other cadets. It is the intention to continue this training and to send fiveto Dartmouth every term.Commendable Service.-The Submarine Minerve torpedoed a Tanker andwas subseqeuntly attacked with depth charges but fortunately sustained little damage. Chasseur 41 destroyed a Junkers 88 during an air raid at Portsmouth.The Commandant Domine attacked a S/M at night off the Canaries and wascongratulated by the Commodore for saving the convoy. Chasseur 8 did goodwork in rescuing the crew of a mined ship and boarded her to remove lightweapons and other gear.Celebration of the Feast of St. Joan of Arc, May 11. A Parade was held atWellington Barracks at which contingents of the Free French Army, Navy andAir Force were present. Admiral Muselier presented Colours to the regimentsand Flags to each of the ships. He then delivered a short address, after whichthe contingents marched past and then proceeded to Westminster Cathedral whereHigh Mass was celebrated by the Cardinal. Both the Ceremony at WellingtonBarracks and the service at the Cathedral were attended by Senior representativesof the British and Allied Services, by many distinguished civilians and by alarge proportion of the French Colony in London.The bearing of the men on Parade was very good and there is no doubt thatthey greatly appreciated this opportunity of appearing before the British public and were grateful to us for joining them in doing honour to their Patron Saint.The affair seems to have disconcerted Vichy and the Germans, who had intendedusing the anniversary as a handle for anti-Free French and British propaganda.Pay and Alloivances. Admiral Muselier has drawn the attention ofN.A. (F) 2 S.L. to the inadequacy of the pay and allowances of Free Frenchofficers and men. The Admiralty have made such minor adjustments as lay intheir power, and, for the rest, the matter has been brought to the notice of theStrang Committee.British-Vichy Relations. The widening bridge between us and VichyFrance has naturally been a matter of concern to Free Frenchmen. Recent events,however, do not seem to have weakened the loyalty of the Free French Navy tothe common cause. In fact, it is possible that that loyalty has, if anything,stiffened. Naturally enough Free French officers and sailors do not want tohave a clash with their own people, but Admiral Muselier is certain that ifthey were faced with such an eventuality they could be relied upon to fight. Thesituation is being closely watched.Morale and Discipline. There has been a steady improvement and thegeneral standard is now far higher than was ever anticipated. Very few adversereports have been&apos;received, and in these cases the cause is due to inactivity and long periods in dockyards.The chasseur flotilla at Portsmouth, comprised partly of British-mannedand partly of French-manned ships, is a very good example of what can beachieved by the two Navies working together. An excellent spirit of co-operationprevails and the French ships do their part well.One of the main difficulties of the Free French Navy is the lack of experienced Naval officers. The majority of the officers are from, the merchant service Reserve, and some of the staff were recently civilians or soldiers and havenever been to sea. This naturally affects administration and morale. Time and increasing experience should ease the situation.Frenchmen in the Royal Navy. Transfers to the F.N.F.L. continue at a steady rate, but on a small scale.Here again thought has been given to what the attitude of these men mightbe in the event of their ships having to engage Vichy forces. The percentages of these men in all ships where they are borne are so small as to make any risk
of serious trouble unlikely, but it has been thought advisable to ask commanding officers to ascertain from Frenchmen under their command what their feelingsexactly are.British Attitude to Free French Personnel. Reports have been received at various times during the last year of occasions when British people have adopted a discourteous and contemptuous attitude towards Free French Naval officersand men. These occasions have been rare, and probably only a few individualshave been concerned. Also, no doubt, the French themselves have been to blameat times. The Admiralty brought this matter to the attention of Commanders-in-Chief some time ago, when it had been alleged that British ratings had openlyshown their dislike of Frenchmen, Free or otherwise.An unofficial report has recently been received from C.-in-C, western approaches, to the effect that French officers and men at Liverpool havecomplained of the contemptuous attitude of Liverpool dockers. The complaintwas put forward in restrained and dignified language,&quot; but it is evident that theFrench are much upset. The Commander-in-Chief consulted Lord Derby, andthe latter wrote an excellent letter, which appeared in the Liverpool Echo.pointing out how necessary it was for all Liverpudlians to treat the Free french as honoured guests.(ii) Army.Strength Camberley Area : 89 Officers, 675 Other Ranks.Parachutists : 10 Officers, 87 Other Ranks.Ranelagh : 30 Officers, 466 Other Ranks.25 Gordon Street, W.C.-Army : 10 Officers, 197 Other Ranks.Air Force : 6 Officers, 19 Other Ranks.Navy : 5 Officers, 121 Other Ranks.Merchant Navy : 2 Officers, 29 Other Ranks.A accommodation The reception centre has been moved to Ranelagh Club, Barnes.The  new  camp  construction  programme  at   Camberley  is  progressingsatisfactorily.Equipment The following has been issued during the quarter75-mm. guns.Rifles, -300-inchBayonetsBrowning machine guns, -300-inchBrowning machine rifles, -300-inchThompsons ...Lewis, -300-inch, groundMortars, 3-inchMortars, 2-inchPistols, SignalBinoculars ...Compasses   ...Motor cycles, soloMotor cycles, combinationsTrucks, 8-cwt., 4-wheeled, wirelessTrucks, 15-cwt., 4-wheeled, water tankTrucks, 15-cwt., wireless ...Lorries, 30-cwt., 4-wheeled, G.S. ...Lorries, 3-ton, 4-wheeled, G.S. ...41,0241,0244926912069363939423114342362Note.

Employment A signals school and mechanics school have been established and work is proceeding.French Officers and other ranks have been greatly assisted by demonstrationsby British units.General Evans inspected the Free French troops in the role they were to play in case of invasion.Welfare On the 18th April, 1941, the Cadets staged a revue written and produced by themselves.Morale In May the political situation caused a certain amount of discussion, but thevast majority of officers and men were of the opinion that the situation provedhow right they were to come over here and continue to fight.Morale at present is excellent, an interesting point being that the vast majority of the men fully approve of the action taken in Syria, and there is general regret that they are not participating.(iii) Air Force.Operations. The main theatre of operations of the Free French Air force during the period under review has been the Middle East, where Free FrenchFighter and Bomber pilots have co-operated with the Royal Air Force in opera-tions over Libya, Crete and Syria. Although no exact report of the successesscored by the Free French pilots has yet been received, a striking tribute was paidto them in a recent signal from Headquarters, Middle East, which spoke of theiroutstanding performance.In the Metropolitan Air Force the number of Free French Fighter pilotsserving in Squadrons of Fighter Command has been reduced through casualties and medical reasons to eleven. During the quarter these pilots have accountedfor eight confirmed enemy aircraft and one enemy aircraft probably destroyed and two damaged.Eleven pilots, five of whom have been trained by the Royal Air Force,have been sent out to the Middle East as reinforcements. Four aircraft, including three aircraft reconditioned by the R.A.F.. have been despatched to general de Gaulle&apos;s Forces in Equatorial Africa to be used there on communication work.Training. The R.A.F. Franco-Belgian Air Training School at Odihamwas closed at the end of May, the aerodrome being urgently required for other purposes. All the Free French pupil pilots who had not completed elementaryflying training at this School were transferred to a R.A.F. Elementary flying training School to complete that stage of training.Arrangements have also been made to absorb up to 25 Free French pupilpilots every six weeks in R.A.F. Initial Training Wings; this rate of intakereplaces the previous agreement to accept fifteen pupils every month. Thesepupils will receive preliminary instruction and English lessons* at the free french Camp at Camberley. Some thirty airmen in this category have alreadyentered I.T.W. and are reported to be making excellent progress.In addition to the thirty Free French pupils at I.T.W. there are now142 Free French pupil pilots undergoing various stages of flying training atR.A.F. schools.Space has also been reserved to train ten Wireless Operator Air Gunners,who will, when trained, be sent as reinforcements to General de Gaulle&apos;s MediumBomber Units in the Middle East. It has also been agreed that up to ten FreeFrenchmen will be accepted in R.A.F. Technical Training Schools every month for ab initio training in technical trades.* See Annex I.
B,   POLES.(i) Navy.Morale and discipline in the seagoing ships remain excellent. In the depotship Gdynia discipline has not been quite up to standard. An improvement inthis respect is hoped for when the personnel is transferred to the shore establish-ment at Devonport (late H.M.C.S. Niobe) on the 1st July.The question of the release of the Gdynia for trooping service, which hasbeen under consideration for some time, has thus been solved. A small sectionof the depot personnel has been transferred to R.N. Depot Govan they are mostly invalids.Two Hunt Class destroyers, now named Krakowiak and Kujawiak, werecommissioned by the Poles in early June. The former was particularlyfavourably reported on after her working up.The Blyskawica has been taken in hand for a long refit and rearming.Proposals for the employment of her crew are at present- under discussion with-the Admiralty.The Piorun took part with distinction in the rounding up of the Bismarck.A recruiting campaign is being started in Canada with the object ofobtaining 1,000 naval recruits.First results are favourable.(ii) Army.Strength East Scottish Area : 4,158 Officers, 13,570 Other Ranks.Armoured Trains : 424 Officers, 78 Other Ranks.G.H.Q., London, &amp;c. : 455 Officers, 139 Other Ranks.Accommodation.

Contingents of Polish Forces took part in War WeaponsWeek parades at Montrose, Forfar, Carnoustie and Monifieth.During the month of April a,course in Bridge Building was held, instructionand lectures on Traffic Control were given by British Officers of &quot;H&quot; traffic control Group, Perth.Artillery practice shoots with air observation took place in April and May1941. The shooting was good, but considerable training in air observation isnecessary.   Various tactical exercises were carried out.An exercise in conjunction with the Rifle Brigade and the guard of the Crailaerodrome was staged to test the defence against attack by parachutists andair-borne troops.   Arrangements have been made between the Home Guard and
Polish garrison to strengthen the defence of Dundee. Valuable lessons were learntthrough a practice battle between 157th Infantry Brigade and Polish 10th(Motorised) Cavalry Brigade.A Gas Exercise was held in Arbroath with the co-operation of the police authorities on the 30th May, 1941. This was carried out efficiently andprecautions were well observed.Officers and O.Rs. have attended Courses; in addition, many officers havebeen attached for training to various British units.Security. -Special patrols with the object of preventing the landing of enemyagents are in the course of organisation in all coastal districts.Welfare. Performances have been given by Concert Parties and films havebeen shown. Football and tennis matches have taken place and a Sports meetingheld at Tulliallan Castle. An Officers&apos; Club has been opened at Kirkcaldy byF.A.N.Y. organisation. Canteens have been opened at Abernethy, Montrose,Marykirk and Brechin.Morale. Good.Medical. By transferring the Polish Forces Central Medical Store toDunkeld, accommodation at No. 1 Polish Military Hospital, Taymouth Castle,has been increased by 15 beds, to a total bed accommodation of 340. The average number of patients in hospital at one time is over 300.Arrangements have been made with the Scottish Command for a RailwayAmbulance Coach with capacity for 12 stretcher cases to be available for thePolish Forces. This coach will be run between the Polish Field Ambulanceslocated at Cupar, Fife, and Forfar, Angus and the Base Hospital, TaymouthCastle.A motor ambulance convoy Section of 20 ambulances has been formed.A Dental centre has been opened at Rothesay, and another centre at Edzellis-in process of formation.Visits. Mr. A. J. Drexel Biddle, United States Ambassador to AlliedGovernments in the United Kingdom, spent 10 days with the Polish Forces inScotland at the beginning of April 1941.Major-General G. H.

Station, Takoradi, tothe Inspector General of the Polish Air Force, in which he expressed hisadmiration for the manner in which the personnel of the Polish Detachment were carrying out their duties under conditions of considerable difficulty. The messagestated that already 100 aircraft had been flown from Takoradi to Egypt byPolish pilots.Morale.The morale in the operational Units continues to be of a very high order andis generally satisfactory in other units.Training.Space has been reserved at a R.A.F. Elementary Flying Training Schoolfor 32 Polish pupil pilots every three weeks. This is in addition to the intake of 50 pupils every three weeks into No. 25 (Polish) Elementary Flying training school.During the period under review 31 Polish pilots have entered C.F.S. for flying Instructor Course; 4 Poles have been sent to the Supplementary FlyingInstructors&apos; School for Elementary Flying Instructor Course and 9 Polish pilotshave entered Link Trainer Course. Approximately 250 partly trained Polishpilots have passed through grading and refresher course during the quarter.64 Poles have entered A.O.N.S. during the quarter and 184 have been sentto Bombing and Gunnery Schools during this time.With the absorption of Poles into Flying Training the number of Polishpersonnel under instruction at the Ground Training School at R.A.F. PolishDepot, Blackpool,, has been considerably diminished. On 25th June, 1941, 454Poles were receiving ground instruction at this School, of whom 203 wereearmarked for flying duties and 251 were receiving instruction in technicaltrades. Only 38 Polish personnel earmarked for Flying training now remain inthe Non-Effective Pool.C. -DUTCH.(i) Navy.The morale and discipline of the Dutch remain entirely satisfactory.The new cruiser Heemskerch commissioned at the end of April and has worked up satisfactorily.The Colombia has been commissioned as depot ship for submarines and isdue to complete shortly.

ANNEX I.Note on English Language Instruction by the Air Ministry.General.DURING the period under review the teaching of English to Allied AirForces has been reorganised and energetically approached. The vital importanceof a sound knowledge of English has been more fully realised by Allied personnel,and their Authorities have urged it upon their nationals.Organisation.An Air Council letter has set up an organisation which embraced thefollowing main features : (i) The responsibility of the Air Officers Commanding-in-Chief of theCommands for instruction in English,(ii) The adequate provision of teaching staff for operational units andtraining establishments within the commands concerned.(iii) Advice and guidance to the teaching staff of the Commands from anOfficer of the Directorate of Educational Services who has been specially appointed to the Directorate of Allied Air Co-operation andForeign Liaison.(iv) The allocation of 30 Educational Officers to operational training units and 18 British Council teachers for other establishments.Progress.-There is a steady advance in the general knowledge of English. A largenumber have become remarkably fluent, and with it have become more completelyconverted to our requirements.There have been occasional difficulties in fighter squadrons over R.T.conversations, and there is room for improvement in bomber crews, so that theymay fully understand briefing and interrogation.We must therefore still call for a steady advance in the knowledge of english.But under the arrangements at present in force, and with a continued effort by Allied personnel, their knowledge of English will progress toward a reallyserviceable standard.
