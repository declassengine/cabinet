(41) 135.June 19, 1941. to BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE MIDDLE EAST.THE following telegrams from the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, are circulated for the information of the War Cabinet, by direction of the PrimeMinister.. E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 19. 1941.(i)The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office, dated June 17, 1941.(0/74021.   17/6.)Personal for C.I.G.S. from General Wavell: Part I.1. Regret to report failure of Battleaxe. After initial success troops havebeen driven back by counter-attack practically to starting positions with heavy loss of tanks.2. Position up to midday, 16th June, was indicated in my 0/73648.*I arrived at Beresford-Peirse&apos;s advanced HQ. at Sidi Barrani that evening just as he returned from visit to his Divisional Commanders. Position up to1600 hours, when he left forward Headquarters, seemed fairly satisfactory.22 Guards Brigade, with two Regiment Artillery, medium battery and A/Tk.guns, was firmly installed at Capuzzo-Musaid-Bir Waer, and was extending to Sollum; it was supported by 4th Armoured Brigade and had repulsed severalcounter-attacks. 700 to 800 prisoners and a number of guns had been captured.On left 7th Armoured Div., with 7th Armoured Brigade, had had successfulengagement with enemy tanks.3. There were, however, certain factors that caused anxiety Halfaya was still held by enemy, and 11th Ind. Inf. Bde., attacking it, had had considerablecasualties. Our tanks were reduced, by enemy action and mechanical breakdown,to about 40 cruisers and 30 Infantry Tanks.    Enemy had shown unexpected[22625]* Not reproduced.
strength in armoured fighting vehicles and still had considerable numbers inaction. Enemy air action was increasing and our aircraft had had number of casulties.4. Wireless communication failed during night 16th/ 17th and no report was received from 7th Armd. Div. until after 0900 hours, and it was then socorrupt as to require repetition. At about 0930 hours report was received of300 M.T. and 75 enemy  anks about Sidi Suleiman, and it was discovered that7 Armd. Div. had been driven back from Sidi Omar and that enemy wereattempting to reach Halfaya and cut off forward troops. It was obvious that important decision on action to be taken would shortly be required. As decision was vital one, I considered I should make it personally and that it requiredfirst-hand knowledge of situation. I therefore arranged at once to fly forward to 7th Armd. Div. H.Q. with Beresford-Peirse.5. Before we could reach H.Q. decision had already been taken by GeneralMesservy, commanding 4th Ind. Div., in following circumstances. During nightGeneral Creagh, finding himself outnumbered at Sidi Omar, had asked that4th Armd. Bde. should move left of Guards Bde. towards area S.E. of Halfaya,to support him if driven back. 4th Armd. Bde. started to move accordinglyearly on 17th June, but at once large enemy colump containing about 100 tanksstarted to move round left of Guards Bde., and General Messervy had to request4th Armd. Bde. to return and counter-attack. They succeeded in driving enemyback but lost number of Tanks in doing so, and as soon as it withdrew enemybegan to advance again. At some time between 0930 and 1000 hours situation as it appeared to General Messervy was as follows : There were three enemy concentrations, one between Bardia and Capuzzo contained 30 to 40 Tanks andhad already advanced on Capuzzo during morning and been driven back; secondwas South of Capuzzo and estimated to contain up to 100 Tanks and wasadvancing on the much depleted 4th Armd. Bde. about point 207; third,containing 50 to 75 Tanks, had reached Sidi Suleiman and was barely being held by 7th Armd. Bde. Halfaya was still in enemy hands and road downescarpment at Sollum was not yet clear.6. General Messervy considered that instant decision was required toprevent forward troops being cut off, and that there was no time to refer to western Desert HQ. He ordered withdrawal along narrow corridor still opento half-way, and movement began from 1100 hours.7. When I reached 7th Arm. Div. HQ. withdrawal from Capuzzo hadalready begun and could not be countermanded. I was sceptical at estimates of enemy strength and ordered Creagh to organize counter-attack with all available Tanks on enemy in Sidi Suleiman area. On finding, however, thatavailable cruiser strength was only between 25 and 30 and that there were lessthan 20 Infantry Tanks available and on receiving confirmation fromGround and Air Reports and from Messervy himself that number of enemytanks had not been exaggerated I realised that counter-attack could only increase our losses and was not necessary to extricate Guards Bde., which had safelypassed through corridor and reached halfway. I therefore gave orders to break off operation and withdraw to refit, collecting as many crippled tanks as possible.8. Position when I left Divisional HQ. at 1600 hours was that 11th Ind.Inf. Bde. was still engaged at Haifaya, but had orders to withdraw during night.22nd Guards Brigade with two regiments artillery medium bty. and anti-tankartillery had reached halfway with apparently little loss. 4th Armd. Bde.reduced to something under 20 Infantry tanks with one regiment artillery wassomewhere West of Halfaya and 7th Armd. Bde. near Sidi Suleiman. enemy was apparently beginning advance in two or three columns towards 7th Armd.Div., which intended to withdraw slowly, covering left of Infantry at HalfwayHouse.9.   Comments will follow in Part II to-morrow.

Your 72736 (M.O. 5).* Do not yet know how many tanks recovered frombattle area, but do not expect more than equivalent one regiment cruiser and oneregiment infantry tanks.   One more regiment infantry tanks now formed in* Not reproduced.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office; dated June 18, 1941,further to telegram No. (1).(0/74021.   18/6/41.)Personal for C.I.G.S. from General Wavell : Part II.1.   Failure was due to following causes :  (a) Enemy disclosed much greater tank strength in forward area than wehad expected.(b) Enemy was obviously ready for our attack and had prepared counterattack.(c) 7 Armd. Division hastily reformed, and with combination of cruisers and infantry tanks was not as effective fighting formation ashomogeneous formation would have been, and had not had time tosettle down.2. We expected to find under 100 medium tanks in forward area. On17th June, after considerable fighting, enemy employed, by all accounts, over 200;it is reported that captured document shows 15th Armd. Division had twotank regiments, instead of one; this, if confirmed, would mean additional 200tanks.3. Ground and our resources practically dictated our general plan, and enemy was undoubtedly prepared for it. Halfaya had been very strongly fortifiedand protected by minefields. We anticipated that his counter-attack would bemade on general lines that it was, and took measures accordingly, but simplyhad not the strength to meet numbers.he employed.4. Combination of infantry tanks and cruisers against enemy homogeneousand mobile armoured force was most difficult. Enemy could always avoidinfantry tanks and concentrate on our cruisers. 7th Armd. Division had had little time to settle down, and very few had any experience of A15 tanks, withresult many mechanical failures. Infantry tanks suffered heavy casualties fromaccurate enemy fire at their tracks. Neither operationally nor mechanically wasthe Division as efficient as it should have been, which mainly accounts for heavyloss of tanks.5. I think General Beresford-Peirse&apos;s plan, which I approved, was as good as possible, given our resources and the ground, and that it was carried outwith resolution. We could not have kept more infantry and guns supplied sofar forward, nor would they have had much influence on battle once our tanks were defeated. I consider General Creagh handled the armoured divisioncorrectly, and that General Messervy&apos;s decision to withdraw the Guards&apos; Brigadewas the only possible one in the circumstances.6. Our air forces protected our troops effectively from enemy bombing,except on certain occasions when their protection had been temporarily with-drawn, and also inflicted considerable casualties on enemy forces in rear. Wenever had sufficient superiority to afford entire protection to our troops, or to stop enemy&apos;s movements. We are not organised or trained for the type of close support the enemy employs, and cannot expect it. Fighting was too close roundHalfaya to make suggestions in your 72736 (M.O. 5)* practicable.7.   End of Part II.8.   A further telegram follows on future policy.
Matruh area and 7th Hussars should be equipped with cruiser tanks early next month. Thus maximum resources in tanks by early July, 2 regiments cruisers,2 regiments infantry tanks, and nothing more in sight until American tanksavailable. Therefore no offensive possible in Western Desert for at least threemonths.2. Policy proposed is same as last year to maintain light covering forcesnear frontier and await enemy at Matruh where 7th Armd. Div. will refitand train. Long L. of C. will, it is hoped, limit force enemy can bring to Matruh.Meanwhile our own attack on his communications will be continued.3. Enemy may decide to exploit his success and advance forthwith towardsdelta if his resources permit, but this doubtful, and he will certainly not do so without considerable increase in air strength. Or he may first attempt capture of Tobruk.4. Our policy regarding Tobruk will require decision. There are consider-able reserves of most supplies but maintenance in ammunition and petrolnecessary and can only be done by destroyer. This may become increasingly difficult. Fortress can probably sustain heavy attack unless large forces divebombers used as at Crete. If decided to evacuate C.-in-C, Mediterranean,considers it should be possible to bring away personnel by destroyer but guns,tanks, and other equipment would probably all be lost. Problem now being examined by Joint Planning Committee for three Cs.-in-C, who will consider their conclusions and cable recommendations.5. Reference para. 2 my 74021. Study of captured document just receivedconfirms our previous information that 15 Armoured Div. had only one tankregiment of two battalions. It seems therefore that enemy brought up practically all tanks from Tobruk area.
