THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  June 1941.SECRET. Copy No. q- /                                                     ^W.P. (41) 138. /June 20, 1941. /TO BE KEPT JfoyER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that &quot;special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document,.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES TO TURKEY.Report by the Committee for the Co-ordination of Allied Supplies.IT has been suggested by the General Staff to the Committee for theCo-ordination of Allied Supplies that in view of recent events in Turkey, of thenecessity for strengthening our own defences against invasion, and of deficiencies in the Middle East and in Iraq, all military stores produced in this country and made available from U.S.A. should now be retained for our own Empire Forces.2. The adoption of this suggestion would render it impossible to continuemilitary supplies to Turkey on the present scale. We should have to stop thesupply to Turkey of certain war material, including 4 3-7-inch A.A. gunsmonthly, with their equipment, ammunition, predictors, height finders, &amp;c.; aswell as tractors, searchlights, consignments of ammunition of various kinds,together with a variety of military stores. We might also have to reduce thesupply of raw materials for Turkish munition factories.3. The supply of military stores to Turkey, therefore, would be limited tothe following : (i) Such supplies as the Middle East Command may find it possible to releasefor Turkey.(ii) Such supplies as can be made available here or from the U.S.A. withoutimpinging on our own military needs.4. Civil supplies, which include categories of a certain strategicalimportance such as equipment for the Turkish railways, steel works and mines,would be less seriously affected, provided that we are able to carry out our present policy of securing civil supplies for the Middle East from the U.S.A. so far aspossible on Lease-Lend terms, and replacing supplies to Turkey from the UnitedKingdom by supplies from the U.S.A. in so far as this can be done withoutinterrupting the flow.5. The General Staff anticipate an increase in their demands for shipping to meet the needs of the Allied forces in the Middle East in the present militarysituation. It is obvious that military requirements will have to take precedenceover civil supplies from the United Kingdom, and it would seem probable thatthe main tonnage available for the latter would be the broken stowage, not usedfor military stores in the ships.6. In the case of ships sailing from United States ports, this broken stowageis considerable owing to the large number of lorries. About 34 ships are sailing from North American ports to the Middle East in the next month.[22633]
7. The arrangements for transporting supplies from Egyptian to TurkishPorts have made progress, and the Turks have now provided five ships under their own flag for this purpose.8. Any appreciable reduction in Turkish supplies is liable to produce reper-cussions. The Turks would presumably ask Germany to supply requirements thatthey cannot obtain from us, as they have already begun to do. They wouldbecome more and more dependent on German and less on British supplies.Gradually the Fighting Services and other British personnel employed by theTurkish Government, who number some hundreds, would be replaced by aninfiltration of German personnel. Probably also the Germans would put pressure on the Turks not to carry out the various agreements for pre-emptive purchases.This would have serious consequences, especially in the case of chrome, which ismuch needed in the U.S.A.9. The subject of supplies is bound up with the question of political relations with Turkey, which is beyond our Terms of Reference and will no doubt be dealt with by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.* We feel sure thatin any review that is made of these aspects, the importance on political relations of maintaining our naval, military and air strength in the Middle East and inother theatres will not be overlooked.10. In view of the considerations of high policy involved, we ask for guidance from higher authority as to whether any alteration in our presentinstructions as to priority and procedure (Appendix) is required.(Signed) HANKEY.55 Whitehall,June 20, 1941.* Note by the Chairman. Since this Keport was completed I note that Sir Miles Lampsonin Cairo Telegram 1922 of the 20th June has raised the question as to whether, in view of recentpolitical developments, it is still intended to give Turkey first claim on resources and shipmentsafter our own forces.

Instructions to the Committee for the Co-ordination of Allied Supplies.I. Priority.The order of priority laid down for the Committee by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee was as follows : (a) Middle East Command.(b) Greece.*(c) Turkey.(d) Far East, including Burma and Netherlands East Indies.(e) China.II.  War Cabinet Decision reached on April 28, 1941 (War Cabinet 44 (41) 7).Our policy in regard to furnishing military and civil supplies to Turkeyshould for the present be as follows : We must continue to furnish supplies. There should, however, be no increase in the volume of supplies; rather, caution should be exercised inregard to long-term projects; and no undue calls should be made on shipping space in respect of articles which would be of little service to ourselves inthe Middle East.* Note. Since the over-running of Greece, Turkey has taken second place.
