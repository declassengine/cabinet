BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet,Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 2, 1941.(1)Prime Minister to Viceroy of India, dated June 20, 1941.(Most Urgent.)(Absolutely Secret and Personal.)I have come to the conclusion that a change is needed in the command inthe Middle East.   Wavell has a glorious record, having completely destroyed the[22647] bSECRET.W.P. (41) 143.July 2, 1941.
2Italian Army and conquered the Italian Empire in Africa. He has also borne up )well against the German attacks, and has conducted war and policy in three orfour directions simultaneously since the beginning of the struggle. I must regardhim as our most distinguished General. Nevertheless. I feel he is tired, and thata fresh eye and an unstrained hand is needed. I wish therefore to bring about achange-over for temporary war-time conditions between him and Auchinleck. i feel sure Auchinleck would infuse a new energy and precision into the defence ofthe Nile Valley, and that Waveli would make an admirable Commander-in-chief in India who would aid him in the whole of the great sphere which India is nowassuming, as our flank moves eastward. Anyone can see arguments against suchan exchange, but I hope you will help me in bringing this about. I shall awaityour reply before communicating with either officer. This telegram is thereforefor you alone.(2)From Viceroy, dated June 21, 1941.(Most Immediate.)(Most Secret and Personal.)Following for Prime Minister :  Grateful for your confidence. I am most ready to forward your proposal foran exchange between Wavell and Auchinleck and in agreeing I dismiss all doubtsand regrets. I feel sure wavell&apos;s shining achievements will secure to him a verywarm welcome from the Indian Army and public opinion here. For myself, Ishall be proud to work with him.(3)The War Office to Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, dated June 21, 1941.(Most Immediate.)(Most Secret.)Following from Prime Minister for General Wavell:  I have come to the conclusion that the public interest will best be served bythe appointment of General Auchinleck to relieve you in the Command of the armies of the Middle East. I have greatly admired y$ur command and conductof these armies both in success and adversity, and the victories which are associated with your name will be famous in the story of the British Army, andare an important contribution to our final success in this obstinate war. I feel,however, that after the long strain you have borne a new eye and a new handare required in this most seriously menaced theatre.   I am sure that you are
incomparably the best man and most distinguished officer to till the vacancy of commander-in-Chief in India. I have consulted the Viceroy upon the subject,and he assures me that your assumption of this great office and task will bewarmly welcomed in India, and adds that he himself will be proud to work with one who bears, in his own words, so shining a record. I propose therefore tosubmit your name to His Majesty accordingly.General Auchinleck is being ordered to proceed at once to Cairo, where youwill make him acquainted with the whole situation and concert with him thefuture measures which you and he will take in common to meet the German driveto the East now clearly impending. I trust he may arrive by air within thenext four or five days at latest. After you have settled everything up with himyou should proceed at your earliest convenience to India. No announcement willbe made, and the matter must be kept strictly secret until you are both atyour posts.(4)The War Office to the Viceroy, India, dated June 21, 1941.(Most Immediate.)(Most Secret.)Following from Prime Minister to Viceroy :  Thank you so much for your telegram.

You should proceed forthwith to Cairo and relieve General Wavell.General Wavell will succeed you as Commander-in-Chief in India, You should confer with him upon the whole situation and should also concert with him themeasures you will take in common to arrest the eastward movement of the german armies, which is clearly impending.

I appreciate your generousreferences to my work and am honoured that you should consider me fitted (? to)fill post of C.-in-C, India.   If at all possible would like short period at home[22647] b 2
before proceeding to India to see my son and settle some business, and I should probably be better (? for) some rest and change before taking up (1 new)Command.

I hope you will allowme to say that I feel a very high sense of comradeship with you after the upsand downs of this tremendous year in the Middle East. I should prefer you to go to India and take over, after which I should like you to come home for consultation on the whole problem, which would give you the chance of a

Auchinleck expects toarrive at Cairo 30th June, and to be with Wavell in order to pick up threadsfor one week before taking over. I have to-day wired Wavell in this sense.Wavell should arrive in India about 10th July. I assume you will wish to keepexchange secret until Wavell takes over here, and am making arrangements
accordingly.   Auchinleck has already made a strong appeal to public in india as well as to armed forces, and I think it will help us (? here) if in public announcement you will be good enough to stress temporary character of exchange    )as war expedient.(11)The War Office to Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, dated June 26, 1941.(Most Immediate.)Prime Minister to General Wavell.   Personal and Secret : You will have heard from Viceroy that he thinks it better you should get inthe saddle in India before coming home on leave and consultations. I am surethis is desirable. I propose to make the double announcement as soon asAuchinleck has reached Cairo, as I do not think it could be kept secret till youreach Simla on the 10th. Would 2nd or 3rd be a convenient date for the actualtransfer of responsibilities.(12)Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office, dated June 29, 1941.(Most. Immediate.). Personal and Most Secret for Prime Minister from General Wavell: Auchinleck arrives Cairo 1st July. He wishes me to remain at least weekafter his arrival.

Will cable as soon as he arrives.(13)The War Office to Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, dated June 30, 1941.(Most Immediate.)Prime Minister to General Wavell.   Personal and Most Secret :-By all means remain a week with Auchinleck. and settle with him best dateof transfer having regard to operations.

7(14)Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office, dated June 30, 1941.(Most Immediate.)Private for Prime Minister from General Wavell:  I do not know if you have any special reason for making announcement on 3rd July, but from my point of view it will be most inconvenient if announcementis made until I leave Egypt. I am very anxious to avoid farewells and explana-tions, especially to Egyptians. Ambassador agrees it is desirable I shall leavebefore or very shortly after public announcement though Prime Minister and king will be informed confidentially. I hope therefore that it is possible to postpone announcement till date of my departure or just before. For reasons of secrecy I have made no preparations whatever for departure at present.(15)Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office, dated July 1, 1941.(Immediate.)Personal to C.I.G.S. from General Wavell :-General Auchinleck has arrived Cairo.(16) .......The War Office to Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, dated July 1, 1941.(Most Immediate.
