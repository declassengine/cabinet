COPY NO./16th June,..1941.WAR CABINET.MORALE OF THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND FORCESIN THE MIDDLE EAST AND OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCEIN EGrYPT.Note by the Secretary.At their Meeting on the 12th June35 the attentionof the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegram from our military Mission in Washington (Gleam No.  66) according towhich the American Minister at Cairo had reported that considerable dissatisfaction existed amongst Australian andNew Zealand troops, and that the morale of the Royal AirForce in Egypt was low.    The War Cabinet invited the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air staff to report to the War Cabinet on the allegations containedin that telegram.A Minute by the Chief of the Air Staff is at\n.ao;: I and a telegram from the Oommander-in-Ghief, MiddleZast, to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff at Annex II.(Signed) E.E.BRIDGES.H   W.M.(41)  59th Conclusions, Minute 3.ANNEX I.Minute by the Chief of the Air Staff.Conclusion 3 of the 59th Meeting of the War Cabineton 12th June, 1941, invited me to report on certain allegationsagainst the R.A.P.  in the Middle East attributed to theAmerican Minister in Cairo.These allegations are:-Low Morale of the R.A.

5220      Immediately after the above mentioned cabinet meeting I sent the following telegram to the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, Middle East;-&quot;Xo944    12/6.    Personal for A.O. C.--in-C.  from C0AoS0United States Minister in Cairo is reportingrepeatedly to America that R.A.P0 morale is lowowing to inferior quality.and quantity of aircraft,that aircraftmen    are behaving badly in Cairo, and&apos;chaotic conditions Takoradi.     Suggest you should paypersonal call with view to giving him opportunity and perhaps encouragement to repeat complaints toyou but without letting him know that his  reports have reached your ears0&quot;Yesterday I received the following reply.-&quot;AOCc 5    14/6o    Your X, 944    12/60    Personal forCo A, So  from Tedder,Have seen United States Minister twice in past   .two days ostensibly on subject of Americanobservers in this country,    I fished hard withvariety of bait but caught nothing,,2C      Had thought that possibly his reports might betraceable to half baked stories from one or other of these observers,,    These observers however talkvery freely with members of my staff and no indication that stories emanate from them and infact opinions they express regarding morale etc,are direct opposite.    Sole other possible erplanpf&apos;&apos;r&quot;is  that Minister thinks by sending such reports hecan hasten and increase American help.    There is good deal misdirected enthusiasm with this aim inthis and other quarters.    Will do my best to directthese efforts on to saner and more productive linesbut difficult in view of fact that I mustnecessarily simulate ignorance of Ministers reports,.&quot;3,      I have the following comments on the fourallegations enumerated in paragraph 1*(a)    Morale,    Both Air Chief Marshal Longmore andAir Marshal Tedder have told me that     A,PBmorale in the Middle East is excellent.    In aletter dated 15th May the present.A.0.0. -in-Cevolunteered the following statement:-&quot;So far as our own fellows are concernedthey are quite literally incredible    Howthsy   keep going, flung as they have beenfrom one campaign to another and then again to a third, under foul conditions, I cannolimagine, but they do. &quot;Except for one small incident in Norway which didnot affect flying personnel,  and can be accountedfor by the fact that the airmen concerned werehastily colle-voted and lacked unit, esprit de cor-ps,I know of no case where E.A.F, moral has beenadversely reported on in this war.

53I can   oil believe that the wid\ely--^le.ged--&apos;-xj. ilure&quot; of the     ;,0 p.   to support the Army in greece and Crete ha-o :.v.-.-...-p,0d in the minds ofofficers and airmen feelings ox  uiscouragementand of resentment against conditions for whichthey were in no way responsibly&apos;---jasrrriely,  the lack of secure bases from which &quot;to fight. But Tam confident that as soon as they are given a chance of fighting on anything like fair terms itwill be found that their morale is unimpaired.,(b) Inferiority in  quani^sr and quality of aircraft^(i)  Inferiority in quantity is admitted.    TheGerman and Italian air forces  (to which must now be added part at least of the Vichy airforce) are on interior lines and so far asaerodromes and maintenance permit can alwaysconcentrate superior numbers against us,    our ground person^&quot;1 ,  stores and equipment requireas many months as the Italians require days or the Germans weeks to reach the mediterranean theatre(ii) The aircraft now reaching the Middle East arethe same in quality as those in use at home,except that the Spitfire&apos; is not sent because it was not designed for use in desertconditions,  and the new heavy bombers have notyet reached a stage of development enabling them to be kept in service so far away fromthe home industry.    Mark II Hurricanes armed with cannon are being sent in increasing numbers and the American Tomahawk    is justcoming into operational usec    The onlyobsolescent type that has been in use againstthe Germans has been the Gladiator, whichthough lacking performance and- fire power has high manoeuvrability and has given a very good account of itself,    Its replacement by hurricanes and Tomahawks is practicallycomplete,f^) Bad behaviour in Cairoe    There are always some instances of misbehaviour in any &quot;io:ge town, butif anything serious had happ^neJ. it vv &quot;&quot;&quot;d surely   -have been reported either by H. M,   Ambassador orby Commanders-in-Chief.    I have heard of no suchreports0(d) Chaotic conditions at Takoradio    This is, eftengiven as an explanation of our inferiority in numbers compared with the Italians and Germans inthe Mediterranean, theatre,.    American observersin particular seem to expect the efficiency of a hastily developed route 3,000 miles acrossthe Middle    of Africa to compare with that of aTrans-American civil air line developed .in peace-time through civilized territory,,Three competent senior officers have recentlyinspected Takoradi,    One has not yet reportedfully.    The other two were impressed with theefficiency of the station.  No specific complaintsuggesting &quot;Chaos&quot; has ever been received.

15. 6,41cBoth. Takoradi itself and the reinforcementroute as a whole are being constantlydeveloped and improved^OoPoANNEX IToYour 72017(M.0.1)  15/6,1.-      Have discussed morale of Australian andNew 2&apos;.ealand troops since (? Greece) and Crete withBlarney,. Freyberg, Mackay and most if not all ofbrigadiers who were in Crete0        Also Eraser NewZealand Prime Minister saw all New Zealand troops from Crete and spoke to me afterwards.      no suggestion of any dissatisfaction such as AmericanMinister reports has come from them and general impression gained from them is that troops fit tofight again as soon as rested and refitted.Naturally after experiences of (? Greece)  (? and)Crete there  is some criticism of plans and arrange-ments by higher authorities that exposed them tosuch superiority of enemy force especially asregards air (? support),.2c      American Minister here is enthusiasticallypro-Bpitlsh but somewhat mercurial in temperament.I do not think his judgment on this matter iscorrect0      Have seen him lately and he said nothing to me on the subject0      - Blarney concurs in this telegram.toc
